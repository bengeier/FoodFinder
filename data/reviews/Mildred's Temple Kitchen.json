{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and rate it better. 

Spacious room with lots of natural light. Sunday morning breakfast for 2, arrived at 9:30 and seated right away. 

Room wasn't full, but at least 5 other tables near us were people who had placed orders and waiting for food. 

Server was pleasant and took our order (a skillet and an egg dish (clearly not memorable)). Coffee came after maybe 10mins. Still drinking mine when refills were circling nearby tables. Didn't see this happen the rest of the time I was there (had to flag someone down).

Maybe i should have read more in advance but I was still shocked that it took 50mins to get our food after we ordered. Being able to see the open kitchen and no one looking like they were working very hard was extra frustrating. Our server disappeared after serving the first coffees and at 45mins in, I asked someone about how much longer it might be for the food. There was no apologetic tone or anything out of the ordinary. I went early to avoid waiting but was starving by the time the food arrived.

The food was tasty and not a bad price for a decent portion. The service, the slowness, not my thing. I can understand leisurely meals or waiting when the room is full or the staff are busting their butts. This wasn't the case. 

I likely won't return. But tip for anyone who does - order the scones with your breakfast. Saw other tables get those early on, probably tides you over to distract from the extremely long wait. Don't look at the kitchen either or it may make you question why they can't move any faster than a snail's pace with the cooking"}
{"text":"I cane her a few friends expecting a fabulous meal. Sadly I don't get this.

Pros:

-Server was great
-Orange  juice was...Awesome!
-Ambiance is wonderful (especially outdoors in the summer)
-Option to make a reservation and they call or text when available

Cons:

-Menu was pre-set 
-Food took along time
-Food came COLD

Overall, I will try again and hopefully get the same server and a better meal."}
{"text":"Lost our place on the list. Barely an apology as they told us it would be another 30-45 minutes after we had waited an hour already.

My parents are in town and we decided to go for a nice brunch, with my sister and girlfriend. Mom loves Mildred's and we're usually treated well there if you don't mind following the protocol (ie waiting). Girlfriend and I show up in advance at 10:20 and we get on the list for 5 people, and are told 45 minutes, they'll text us. We go and meet my parents and sister to wait at a nearby coffee shop. 45 minutes rolls around and no call or text. We walk back, its now 11:20 and I've at least had coffee, and they've lost our name on the list. The place is obviously over run and there are groups immediately on deck for every possible available table. 

I always thought Mildred's managed their high volume well. I never felt I needed to hound the staff to make sure I would get my table. Guess the management is slipping, not sure I can trust them for my family Sunday brunches anymore."}
{"text":"We ordered Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes and Huevos Monty at brunch time. The pancakes are so fluffy and delicious! I liked the rich flavour and the blueberry sauce between the pancakes that allows us to enjoy the middle and bottom pancakes without worrying about running out the delicious sauce on top. Huevos Monty was also good. A lot of ingredients matched nicely. However their hot chocolate was disappointing... I was looking forward to tasting Callebaut dark chocolate, that was my first time and seemed high quality... but it tasted just a sugary drink. I didn't feel any chocolate flavour. Maybe it was because of the quality of Callebaut chocolate? Also it didn't come with whipped cream, and the cup was so small. My home made hot chocolate (cocoa powder, milk, and sugar) is much better."}
{"text":"Matter of fact, I love pancakes. I cannot find words to express how much I love pancakes.

Mildred's Temple blueberry pancakes are never physically attractive, but they are graceful and beautiful that makes the roof of my mouth moan the most perfect moans. 

The pancakes evidently know nothing about properties of beauty until my tongue quivers. That, folks, is how I view happiness."}
{"text":"So, we arrived at 1:45pm, for Brunch on a Saturday. We were told that we had to wait for 45 minutes. We waited at the bar, and waited and waited. Finally, at 2:55pm, the servers seated us at our table. We quickly ordered our meal, and waited again. At 3:15pm, and after waiting for 1 hour and 30 minutes, the server comes back and says that the kitchen made a \"mistake\" with our order, and that it would take a bit longer. Finally, our meal arrived at 3:45pm and over two hours since we arrived. The service is crap and the food is mediocre at best. Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"I have been to Mildred's Temple Kitchen for both brunch and dinner, but the following review and stars given are applicable for brunch only! I would definitely recommend visiting for brunch over dinner.

Mildred's is a beautiful, clean, wood and white space, tastefully decorated in a minimalist style. The vibe and decor is perfect for a more elegant feeling brunch. 

We started off with two of their fresh in-house baked scones (which I believe were one of each blackcurrant and buttermilk). It came with fresh clotted cream and jam preserves which made the tasty flaky, buttery scones all the more delicious.

My lovely date and I shared the Veda's choice and the blueberry buttermilk pancakes. Veda's choice was delicious, I would go back just to have it alone. The flaky croissant cut in perfect halves, sandwiched a perfectly poached egg amply covered with a creamy b√©arnaise sauce. It comes with a choice of rosemary bacon or smoked salmon, and I went with the rosemary bacon which was just the right amount of crispy. It came with a side of mixed greens but I don't remember it being anything special.

The blueberry buttermilk pancakes were quite possibly the most fluffiest pancakes I've ever had, even though they were thick. It had a generous amount of blueberries, was drenched in syrup, and came with a side of whipped cream. It was a treat, but definitely on the sweeter side.

The service was decent for the busy weekend brunch hour. I would recommend picking up a few scones and trying the Veda's choice if you're ever in the Liberty Village area (they also serve it during weekdays at lunch). Beware if you are going for weekend brunch, the wait times can be a bit crazy."}
{"text":"Very nice and spacious brunch spot !
We arrived on a Saturday at around 11am and we only had to wait 15 min for our table. The server told us it can take up to an hour wait most Saturdays for brunch ! 
The food was delicious, our server was very friendly and the restaurant is just a very nice modern but comfortable concept that is perfect for big groups as well! 
The blueberry pancakes are definitely a must try !"}
{"text":"This little gem is situated in Liberty Village. 
Since Winterlicious is now on, i decided to take advantage of  Mildreds Amazing Winterlicious Menu.

Upon arriving we were escorted to our table extremely promptly. Our server Welcomed us to the restaurant and asked us would be like a beverage. The server's knowledge of all the beers, wines and drinks MTK had to offer, was in my opinion amazing. We were recommended a pale ale beer which i have to admit was quite tastey. My guest was given a glass of champagne, which she also enjoyed. We were given buscuits for the table.. which were nice. (i wanted more)

When it comes to a winterlicious menu... some restaurants do not give you a lot of selections. MTK gives you a lot of choice. For my appetizer i decided to go for the Shrimp and Crab Cakes, these came in portions of 3 with s side of garden salad. I was highly impressed. My guest went for the Warm Beet Salad, and while she did enjoy the salad itself... the portion was a little too big. 

For our Entree we both decided to go for the MTK Burger. This was amazing. The burger is cooked to how you would like it. Our server recommend Medium .. so we agreed. The burger is presented on freshly baked bun, with carmelized onions, relish and upon recommendation lots of handmade aoili sauce. The fries comes in a little pot beside the burger and was just enough to seal the deal. Id recommend this to anyone. One of the best burgers i have ever eaten. My Compliments to the chef.

Upon waiting for dessert, i asked our server for a Latte.... This was one of the best lattes i have ever drank. I made sure to tell her that too. 

For Dessert i decided to go for the profiteroles.... These were also extremly tastey.

Amazing Service, Great  food and the friendly atmosphere makes Mildred's the place to be in Liberty Village."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for dinner and once for brunch.

They have a simple menu but that makes it easier to choose.  It looks like they change up their menu from time to time, which is nice.  I like trying new dishes.

Nice brunch.  Hate that they don't take brunch reservations and have had to go to other places a few times because they wouldn't reserve and there was a long lineup when my groups from out of town arrived.

Beautiful interiors from the table area to the bar to the waiting area and rest rooms.  It's very open so it can get very noisy during peak times.  Had a soft-spoken waiter once and it was an interesting exercise in lip-reading.

All in all it is a beautiful restaurant with nice, reasonably priced food and nice staff."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience!  Food, ambiance, service - everything was top notch.  We had the groupon menu for two.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm surprised the reviews are SO varied...from 1 star to 5 in a matter of days.  One of the low stars was a Groupon-er so that prolly explains that one (Groupon-ers are cheap and want the best for the least).
I went on a slow night so there weren't any hipsters and the staff was right there to seat us, get us water etc.
The food was divine.  ABSOLUTELY DIVINE.  Like 5 star divine.  I have recommended it to clients who say it's the only nice restaurant in Liberty Village.  
I will try it again and see if all these \"bad service\" comments have any weight."}
{"text":"I visited Mildred's Temple Kitchen with co-workers for lunch today to try out their Summerlicious menu. They have a spacious shaded patio out front, and plenty of seating inside as well.

Food - For the appetizer, I ordered the trout crudo with shaved fennel, summer radish, stone fruit salad, and citrus vinaigrette. The trout was delicious, but left me wanting more. My co-workers ordered the chilled summer soup and the goat's cheese salad as their appetizer dishes, and after sampling each one, we all agreed that the trout was the tastiest of the three.

For the main dish, I ordered the crispy Lake Erie white perch corn tacos with pickled onion slaw, cr√®me fraiche, and jalepeno. Both of my co-workers ordered the pulled pork dish for their main.

After a bit of a lengthy wait, the mains arrived. The pulled pork dishes were served piping hot in a mini skillet. They were VERY good. My perch tacos were also quite tasty but not nearly filling enough - only 2 tacos were included.

For dessert, I ordered the affogato milk chocolate ice cream doused with hot espresso and a biscotti on the side. The ice cream was a perfect way to cap off the meal on a blisteringly hot day. 

Price - $20 plus taxes and gratuity. Reasonable, but a little over-priced for what you get.

Service - our server was very friendly and attentive, but it took a great deal of time to get our food and our bill. We arrived before noon and didn't leave until 1:30pm. 

Final verdict - worth a visit for Summerlicious, but be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"My go to brunch place - Mildred's is the staple of any trendy Liberty Village brunch diet. Unfortunately like a lot of popular brunch spots they don't take reservations so expect a long wait time on the weekends!
Aside from that, this place is simply divine. I love the modern interior, and I love the menu! The Blueberry pancakes are a must, even if not the whole plate itself - get it as a side order, you cannot miss out! The Huevos Monty is definitely a main highlight, a delicious melange of flavours and textures complimented well with brunch cocktails.
All hail Mildred's!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice for breakfast/brunch, and both times thought it was a great treat. Personally, it's a little out of my price range to be a regular morning meal spot, but it's perfect for a splurge day. 

The biscuits are truly amazing. If you like biscuits, you cannot leave without trying one. The menu is a little small, but the meals are nice unique dishes that are really fresh and tasty. 

Wait staff is friendly and attentive, and the wait times for food isn't that bad even though both times I have been there the place has been packed. Be prepared to wait for a table, but once you do, it's a really great experience."}
{"text":"The blueberry pancakes are out of this world! The restaurant is very beautiful, perfect for a date or brunch with some friends. The location is great if you want to take a stroll to digest after your pancake feast."}
{"text":"I can't believe the reviews that this restaurant has been receiving... I have never in my life been to a restaurant in the GTA with such horrible service. We waited an hour for brunch (Thursday morning) even though there were seats available at the bar but they said the place was full. Once we got a seat, it took the server 30+ min to even take our drink order until we complained to them that we've been waiting for over 30 minutes to order anything. Once he took our food order it took them another 45 min to bring out a salad, chicken club sandwich and pancakes. Should it take that long to order? I will never come back here again and definitely tell all of my friends to be cautious of this place. I'm shocked that they're still in business and been receiving the reviews they've been getting. Stay away..."}
{"text":"Mildred's Temple Kitchen is a hip and fun spot in one of Toronto's foodie havens. Mildred's takes their food seriously, which results in one of the better burgers in Toronto. 

The MTK burger is a hand-crafted burger topped with tomato relish, crispy tobacco onions, and is served on a pain au lait bun with dressed greens. The MKT burger is a departure from the classic combination of burger toppings, and is a culinary experiment that works beautifully. A tender bun with a salted top, works will with the hearty flavor of they tomato jam, and crisp-but-rich flavor of the tobacco onions. The loosely packed patty packs flavor into each bite, and the sauce on the bottom bun helped to pull all the flavors together. The MTK burger took me a on a flavor well-executed flavor adventure that I'd enjoy again. 

My only hints of improvement would be that the burger was a little unmanageable in total height, and that some more cheese/sauce to complement the onion strings would make the entire experience mouth-watering."}
{"text":"This is literally as good as it gets. We had a brunch reservation for 5 to celebrate getting married at city hall that morning. We had a big reception planned for another day but I just wanted this to be a very private cutesy small affair with our close friends. The management was oh-so-nice to us, they made it so memorable! They treated us to their famous scones, mimosas and a beautiful chocolate mousse dessert spelling out congratulations. The buttermilk pancakes were also so fluffy and delicious and soo filling. 

All in all the food was delicious, ambience perfect and service was excellent. Couldn't have asked for a more perfect place. Thank you Mildred's!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Waited 20 minutes for a seat on the patio - totally worth it!

Scones & Biscuits - currant scones or buttermilk biscuits served with homemade preserves - Got both of these and prefer the biscuits over the scones. The scones are not nearly as good as the ones from School Bakery & Cafe but the biscuits were nice and flakey.
Veda's Choice Mildred's classic - poached eggs on a flakey croissant with smoked salmon topped with B√©arnaise sauce & served with mixed greens - I tried to split this in half but ended up making a glorious mess by cutting right into the egg. However, this was pretty damn tasty as far as messes go.. I'd definitely get it again.
Mrs. Biederhof's Legendary Light & Fluffy Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes - served with Lanark County maple syrup & whipped cream - The best pancakes we've ever had in Toronto! Comes with 3 extremely fluffy pancakes that will make your stomach very happy. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went to Mildred's Temple Kitchen in Liberty Village for brunch with friends this Sunday. It was my first visit to this relatively new venue; I'd never been to Donna Dooher's and Kevin Gallagher's other restaurant Mildred Pierce before, and so I can't compare the two. What I can say is that MTK is a very pleasant and tastefully decorated space, with a nice clean-looking concrete floor and green mesh drapes covering the windows, which are quite large.

There's a small terrace at the entrance on the west side of the restaurant. This outdoor area doesn't get any sunlight until the afternoon however, so if you wanted a sun-drenched al fresco brunch, you should probably opt for a later sitting.

Inside, the bar is close to the main doors and separates the dining room, which is spacious and surprisingly bright given that the windows are mostly north-facing. The view from the tables is nothing too exciting; of the train lines immediately adjacent to the windows, which is actually kind of cool; a VIA Rail train trundled slowly by as we dined!

The restaurant is open at 10 a.m. on Sundays, and we arrived just shortly after that. Even after having just opened its doors, the place was quite busy with a mixed crowd of couples, groups of friends, and families with small children. The buzz was palpable; it was neither too loud nor too quiet and made for a very pleasant backdrop to good conversation.

I had what the menu referred to as the 'Vedas choice', which was basically a warm croissant sandwiching two poached eggs and smoked salmon, served with a b√©arnaise sauce and crispy, oven roasted potatoes. As delicious as this was, if you go there expecting a good hearty brunch you'd probably need to order an extra side of potatoes, as the servings are fairly small.

The service was friendly and fast and the overall experience was very positive. Definitely worth a revisit."}
{"text":"Are you a fan of never knowing when you will be seated?

Well have I got a place for you. 

My girlfriend and I went to this hipster-chique restaurant to have a lovely Sunday morning brunch on a brisk, cold, February morning. 

Of course it was busy (which isn't a problem). We were told that we could leave our number and they would text us in approximately 40-45 minutes when our table was ready. 

Awesome! Sweet! Great! So, we go out to grab a coffee and wait for nearly an hour. We decide to go back to check up on our table. (Thinking \"Hey, maybe they forgot us, which is human, no big deal). 

We walked up to the visibly frazzled hostess and were told \"another 10 minutes\". So we waited in the entry way for another ten minutes, and went to ask when it would be ready. \"Another 10 minutes\" was what we were told. At this point we had waited for around an hour and a half. We were however, graciously offered the table near the entry way where we could assuredly keep our coats on the entire meal \"Wonderful, says I! Who doesn't want to freeze their butt off all meal!\"

All this to say that, Mildred's Temple Kitchen, we get it, you are busy. However, I guarantee that this isn't the first time you have been busy and unless you want a bunch of very angry customers, you have to learn to provide estimated wait times so that your future customers don't waste 1.5 hours waiting for a table. 

Did we stay? No.
Can we recommend the food? No, because we didn't eat there. 
Would we recommend this place to others? Meh, Toronto has other places to try that can provide you with proper wait estimates."}
{"text":"Was just ok....

So I had really high hopes for this place! We went there for dinner, so can't comment on the brunch everyone is raving about.

The decor was really nice and the wine selection was great, the drink menu is a bit pricey as is the food for the quantity.  

We shared the poutine which was pretty good, and was a ok size for sharing. I had the gnudi, which I believe was about $14 and consisted of 5 small balls which was hardly an appetizer. I wasn't very hungry so ordered that thinking it was something I   can nibble on.  It was very rich and cannot be considered a sharable portion.  

Paid about $8 for 2 hours to park there, but I guess that is normal for that area.  I could not justify birayni for $26! You can get that at an authentic indian resto for about $10 a pop, fancy plating does not justify the entree.  

I personally wouldn't go there again, because there are so many great restaurants to try in the area and I don't mind paying a premium for food as long as  it's justified."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday dinner the other night.  I had really liked the original Mildred Pierce and had wanted to check out this version of it for a long time.

The room was a little stark for my tastes but it looked good.  We started with cocktails and I had a great drink which I can't remember the name of - it had rum in it with a slice of pineapple in it and was really tasty.  We then ordered the bread with olives.  I found that we had to wait a long time to have our order taken and for the food but we weren't in a hurry so it didn't bother us.

For the mains I had the chicken biryani and my boyfriend had the steak.  I liked the chicken a lot - the onion and date chutney was a really nice touch and the portion size was pretty good I thought.  The steak was really good and I think I would order that next time.

For dessert, we split the profiteroles and they were really good.

I gave Mildred's 3 stars - I thought the food was a 4, but the decor was not my taste."}
{"text":"Celebrated a friends bday here a couple of months ago, there were 15 ppl, so they arrange a long table to fit all of us. The service and environment is really great for a nice dinner party!
I had an ox tail gnocchi and burger. Oh man, the gnocchi was to die for! Gravy was full of flavor but not too much, complimented by the melted cheese on top and fluffy gnocchi. I seriously can have that every day! The burger was delicious too! Juicy, tender and the amount of centers was just enough for a girl to bite into without making a big mess.
Would love to come back to try their brunch."}
{"text":"I love brunch and MTK is definitely a place to check out for a different spin on brunch. 
I had the Lottie Says \"It Keeps Me Thin, Mrs. Pierce\".  I'm not too sure if this actually does since it's a salad with mushroom (looove mushrooms), rosemary bacon and topped with a fried eggs. Frankly, I don't care if it can or cannot keep me thin. I loved it. The mushrooms are morsels of juiciness with every bite and it has bacon. 'Nuff said - bacon can do no wrong and is always right. 
My sister had Veda's Choice - a croissant sandwich with smoked salmon & a poached egg with a side salad. The croissant was buttery and flaky. I would get this next time I'm there. 

I've also come for a quick bite in the evening and had their charcuterie platter and gnocchi poutine. Their charcuterie platter is good and you can't go wrong with anything that has prosciutto it doesn't rival The Black Hoof or even Terroni's platter.  The gnocchi poutine was melt in your mouth sinful deliciousness. Large pieces of oxtail and gravy over melted cheese curds and pillows of gnocchi.  I wish it came in a tub. 

The restaurant is spacious and bright.  The washroom has an Air Canada take off announcement playing in the background. Pretty cool."}
{"text":"4 stars overall - 5 for the cocktails, 3.5 for the food. I think it balances out. Went for dinner on a Saturday evening.

1) Environment - Trendy spot located in Liberty Village. Loved the set-up, great looking interior, very spacious and reasonably classy feel. Good for a couple for a dinner date for sure.

2) Food - Above average, but perhaps not what it had been billed to me as. The menu has a nice mix of shareables and main courses. I stuck to mostly vegetarian and fish options (hand cut frites, crab cakes, brocolli florets, acorn squash) given dietary restrictions. The dishes were good, I definitely thought the squash was the best. Great flavours - hints of smokey bacon almost (no bacon in it), with a rich touch. The crab cakes were alright - deep fried, nothing special, although the slaw with the candied cashes were yummy. The brocolli florets were overloaded with garlic, definitely dominated the flavour. The fries were fries - can't go wrong here.

3) Drinks - Phenomenal. Great flavours, describing them does not do them justice - very smooth and delectable. I recommend the ginger fizz and bittersweet symphony! 

4) Service - Great service. Called in to inquire about seating availability and was told that they'd arrange something for us by the time we got there. Sure enough - they had a table waiting (without us making reservations), which was nice. The servers were friendly and upbeat. Service with a smile and also entertaining to talk to. The food came out promptly as did the drinks."}
{"text":"I finally got the chance to come here for brunch after hearing amazing reviews from coworkers and the place did not disappoint.  

First, the atmosphere of Mildred's itself is nice and cool.  The high ceiling and the amount of space in the dining room is both inviting and comfortable. 

While waiting for my table, I ordered a Caesar and woah!  Mildred serves a delicious Caesar.  I asked the bartender what type of hot sauce they used and it was something they made in house and the set up of the celery also added to the uniqueness of the drink.  

The brunch food was pretty sweet as well.  I ordered a Veda's Choice which was an eggs Florentine that came on a croissant and had a side of salad.  I'm not a huge fan of my eggs Florentine being on a croissant but I applaud Mildred's for changing it up a bit.

My friend ordered the blueberry pancakes and I stole a bite.  Seriously, hands down the best pancake I've ever had.  It tasted like a buttermilk biscuit with a pancake texture.  I was in love and will definitely need to go back to try that.

My only dislike with the place was the service. The bartender was awesome and great but my server was horrible.  We waited 20 mins at our table before our server came by to take our orders and then we didn't see her again until she gave us our check.  She deserved little to nothing of the tip we gave her and if I could, I would have allocated it all to the cooks, busboy and the bartender.

Other than the service, I would go back again."}
{"text":"We had great seats overlooking the kitchen. 

Amazing biscuits and warm scones. My egg and smoked salmon (organic ocean) croissant rated the best in my book. Chef informed us that his Bernaisse recipe is 1/8 the clarified butter than a typical recipe. I liked that he talked with us and shared some of his stories with us. 

The Bungalow Caesar bloody was beautifully garnished and served with chop-sticks!"}
{"text":"Pastries are the highlight!

Mildred's is housed in a bright, industrial building in Liberty Village.  Well lit and quiet it is a quaint location for brunch. I ordered Veda's Choice with smoked salmon and my date ordered the same with rosemary bacon.  As an appetizer we shared an order of the scones and biscuits.  

The currant scone was the highlight of the meal.  Perfectly light with the right amount of fruit and sweetness, it was heavenly with the preserves.  The Veda's were served on flakey, buttery croissants and were both quite delicious.  

Overall the service was good, nothing special but perfectly adequate. However, the plating was a bit sloppy with the Bearnaise unintentionally dribbled haphazardly on the plate (not shown in photo).

Overall, a good meal.  Worth the price and a potential one hour wait?  Maybe.  Will I return? Probably."}
{"text":"First time.  I decided to try the blueberry pancakes.  They were fluffy with fresh creme and wild blueberries incl. Maple syrup.  It was more then I expected which was a nice surprise. I recommend this bright spacious place for brunch.  Do it. Do it! :)"}
{"text":"Average brunch. Pancake isn't fluffy but dense. If you want nice atmosphere and ok brunch, this would meet the needs."}

{"text":"Went to Mildred's Temple Kitchen for brunch a couple of weeks ago. I'd been there before just for drinks on the patio but this was the first I was inside the restaurant. 

The design of the restaurant was really nice and the place is actually quite large and spacious. We didn't have to wait to be seated, which was nice and uncommon for Liberty Village. 

I had Veda's Choice, which was kind of like a eggs Benny and my friend  had the Huevos Monty. Both were great dishes and really flavorful. The latte was also pretty good. Overall i really enjoyed my meal, the prices were reasonable, the staff were friendly and the entire experience was great.  This place is definitely worth a try. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Came for lunch at Mildred's and was a bit underwhelmed. 

The atmosphere was amazing but all in all for the price, I want more flavour.  The best thing was the bread budding for dessert. That was the bomb. But everything else was just ok."}
{"text":"Somehow my wife and I got a seat within 20 minutes for brunch at 11am on Saturday.  By the time we finished and left, there were a lot of people waiting to eat.

On to the food.  We ordered the famed pancakes and the pulled pork skillet for our mains, and the biscuit & sconce to start.  The skillet, although small, was extremely heavy and filling.  Had a kick of heat, which didn't bother me.  The pancakes were fluffy and thick, you can taste the buttermilk in every bite.  We couldn't finish this as the portions were huge.  I think the pancakes expanded in our stomachs as well.

The overall atmosphere was rather loud.  Perhaps it's the cavernous space or everybody was high on the pancakes."}
{"text":"We went to Mildred's on a Wednesday afternoon for belated birthday pancakes. By now, I'm sure everyone is aware Mrs. Biederhof's Legendary Light & Fluffy Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes are the most killer pancakes in town (http://www.templekitchen.com/mrs-biederhofs-blueberry-buttermilk-pancakes/). It's bliss going back once in a while to reaffirm it. Guaranteed, your thoughts will sound something like this: \"God, are these ever as good as I remember!\" What stood out for me in particular during this visit was the stellar service from our waiter, Scott, who definitely went above and beyond to ensure our visit was incredibly lovely! He even brought out a sweet little eclair with a candle after our meal and moved our unfinished virgin drinks to to-go cups (a strange request, to be sure, but no one denies the birthday girl). My sister and I were truly grateful for the space he and the waitstaff created for our special afternoon. There's nothing like the warm feeling of being truly looked after."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere were great. I don't think I would be going there again thou, it has a huge line up, and its a tad bit over rated. I must add I didn't try their blue berry pancakes, which is their most favoured item on the menu. Overall cool spot to try out."}

Smaller portions but the taste makes up what it lacks in size. Ensure you try their blue berry pancakes during the blueberry festival - my personal favorite"}
{"text":"Note: this is a review for their brunch -- i have never tried this place for dinner.

i'll probably never come here for brunch again.

I understand that brunch places in the city are crowded, but the system is really a little ridiculous. I live next door to this place, and knowing that the there's often a long wait, i thought i would come and put my name down then go back home wait for my table then come back. It wouldn't take me more than 3 minutes to walk over. But obviously it's too much to expect a phone call when your table is ready, because they just don't do that here (unlike every other popular restaurant in the city -- i.e. electric mud, la carnita, ect). All they suggest is for you to grab a drink at the bar while you wait for your table. The bar, however, is also full: so grab a coffee and stand around to wait for your table that will be ready in around an hour. 

In other words, you can't go sit down at the starbucks or balzaks around the corner because if you miss your table the wait starts over. Just stand there, wait, and be patient.

On top of it all, their patio ONLY features 4 person communal tables. That's to say that if you are 4 people and have your dog with you (which you will tie up to the outside of the fence next to your table while you eat) you have to wait and HOPE that 2 of the pairs at the same table finish at the same time. If only one pair finishes, they'll put in another pair, and you'll have to keep waiting. In other words, you'll probably have to wait all day just to get a 4 person table outside. 

It's worth noting that I have been to this place twice from brunch. Both times the food was above average (deserving of about 4 stars) and the people working their were reasonably nice -- that's why they still get 2 stars. That said, i have little patience for places that know very little about being hospitable or accommodating in any way to their clients, so i'll never come back."}
{"text":"From the phone call to book the reservation, the callback to confirm it from them, the hostess, bartender and especially the waitress Mya.. I was totally impressed!!

Service was outstanding and then the food exceeded my expectations.

All of the food was extra-ordinary. (First time there for Dinner) Obviously the chef knows her stuff as the flavours just jumped off the plate.  

Added bonus was them having a wicked hot sauce which I find hard to get at most places.  Not only hot but delicious

We had an amazing evening and will definately return to sample more of the food and enjoy the comic renditions of Mya some more.. and oh Mya if you read this

.. How can you be so dumb!! LOL

To finish it off the space was wonderful and the unisex washroom a conversation piece.. guess I can check that one off my bucket list :)"}
{"text":"4.5 stars for brunch!

Located in Liberty Village, what a change from the kitschy brunch spots I normally hit up. A great space with high ceilings and a very modern and loft-y feel. My boyfriend and I arrived around noon and found the patio to be full (our first choice), but they still had many tables free inside.

We started out with the black currant scones which was served with some apple preserves (2 for $5 or 6 for $12). They had a nice crusty exterior while still being incredibly moist in the interior. Although I didn't love the preserves, the scones were delicious on their own - no need to hide behind any preserves. Highly recommended! You can also get these to go if you really like them. I was really tempted... but my waistline later thanked me for not getting any for the road.

For my main, I went with Veda's Choice - Mildred's classic poached eggs on a flakey croissant with smoked salmon, B√©arnaise sauce & mixed greens ($14). Loved the flakiness of the croissant, which was the perfect vehicle for the perfectly poached eggs and the generous amount of bearnaise sauce. Didn't touch much of the salad... wish it came with a side of potatoes instead. I certainly don't go for brunch to eat a salad...

My boyfriend went with Mrs. Biederhof's Infamous Light and Fluffy Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes - served with Lanark County maple syrup & whipped cream ($13). It came with three thick pancakes which didn't seem like much at first, but after eating a scone and going through 2 pancakes, he hit a wall. That's where I came in... the pancakes had a crisp exterior and were really light and fluffy! Loved them.

Overall - a great experience. Great food, great service and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here was pretty good.  It's obvious a lot of thought went into the design and fixtures.  The food however, I wasn't as impressed with.  I had a curry dish that was far too sweet.  There were some sweet ingredients (sweet potato, carrot, raisin) but in addition to this the sauce also seemed to be sweet and there was clearly too much cardamon in it - a good way to ruin a curry sauce.  It was decent, but not much more than that.  My companion's meal was also over-spiced - and we are not afraid of flavour.  I'd return for brunch, but not dinner."}
{"text":"Nice place with relaxing atmosphere! The tables are spread out and you don't feel cramped at all. You don't have to speak quietly yet the place does not get noisy which is VERY important :)

Food is okay here but the entire experience makes it all a popular place."}
{"text":"Soooo worth the hype. The Blueberry pancakes OMG best pancakes I've ever had and I love to eat. Also loved the salmon eggs Benedict in a croissant. Spicy lunch skillet was also very solid. Great decor and ambiance, great service. You'll need a reservation on weekends."}
{"text":"There's nothing in this entire world I love more than those perfect, white, cream puffy things otherwise known as poached eggs. I eat poached eggs at least once a week because I like to give my cholesterol some bang for its buck. When the plate with my beautiful poached eggs is set down before me, nine times out of ten I have a moment of silence in honor of nature's edible egg. 

Mildred's Temple Kitchen, found in trendy Liberty Village, is, at first glance, another overpriced, high on its hype, Toronto brunch destination. Its slick interior of wood, glass and concrete seems more at home in Greenwich Village than Liberty Village. Nevertheless, I was excited to finally make my way to the venerable resto.

The hostess was sweet and helpful, and I got to choose my seat as the place was empty, save for two other tables. Then, my wait ensued. It took my server more than five minutes to come over even when the place was literally empty. She took another five minutes to bring my coffee and then another five minutes to take my order. Fifteen minutes before ordering isn't my idea of a good time. Also, in keeping with the Toronto theme of keeping restaurant guests completely parched during their meal, I practically had to send up flares to get my server to bring over some more water. *Frustrating!* Anyway, on to the the most important part -- the food!

Always seeking out flavors from the South (by which I mean Tex-Mex!), I ordered the Huevos Monty. It turned out to be two giant, black bean and cheese-stuffed tortillas, with salsa and a (very small) dollop of avacado cr√©me frauche and two eggs. I ordered mine poached and they were just that -- perfectly poached! The food was good; it wasn't the best or the worst I've ever had. That said, for $20.24 before tip, I expected a little more. 

Overall, the food is good and I would probably go back, as long as I didn't have the same (terrible) server."}
{"text":"Arrived here for brunch with a friend and was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere at this location. The restaurant is bright, clean and inviting. Our server was pleasant and attentive. 

I had the Veda's choice and it was fantastic! The Bearnaise sauce was amazing and the eggs were cooked perfectly. I enjoyed their coffee thoroughly as well, and look forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"Great food! Went for shuck and buck oysters, dinner and drinks. Oysters were a little small but delicious!! Dinner was yum!!! Tried the duck waffles. It was sooo good. The skin was crispy to perfection. Definitely try if you like duck. Take a bite with duck, salad, some egg yolk from a sunny side up egg, waffle and some of the berries!! It's like heaven in your mouth! Yum yum yum!!! A little pricy for the amount you get but it could be worse. Cute decor. Saw many people out on dates, family dinner or hang outs with friends.

Only down side was the service. It was fast before 6 when the restaurant was empty but once it got busy it took us soooo long to get our food :/ prepare to wait if it's dinner time or during brunch. It's something that Mildred's is known for. Last time I was here for brunch was the same. It took forever. Ah well. Worth the wait in the end."}
{"text":"Never mind brunch - Mildred's dinners are great!

Finally got to Mildred's Temple Kitchen for dinner.  We'd been (and attempted to go) to brunch a number of times.

Gotta say I will take dinner at Mildred's over lunch every time.  It's not the food (both are fantastic) - it's the ambience!  Unlike the brunch, which has all the atmosphere of a high school cafeteria, dinner is a relaxed, well paced event.  Waitstaff have the opportunity to really describe the dishes, answer questions, and make you feel very welcome.  The restaurant was about 1/2 full (we walked in; no reservations) and stayed that way the entire time we were there.

A wonderful thing about Mildred's is the vegetarian options.  Unlike other restaurants, theirs are well thought out and go beyond the 'pasta and vegetables' that often constitute the only veg option.  My partner, a vegetarian, had the stuff squashed.  It was very well spiced and I regretted not getting it in some ways.  However, my braised short rib was fantastic - fall off the bone tender, well seasoned, and with a wonderful creamy polenta.  The only real negative was the side of broccoli we ordered - although tasty it was on the cool side.  It clearly came out a little ahead of the mains.

Item prices are reasonable, with the exception of the beers and wine by the glass.  The wines, in particular, hover around $13 for a six ounce pour, which seems to be more of the norm in Toronto but certainly was a bit excessive.

Service was fantastic and relaxed.  Our waitperson remarked that she really enjoyed dinner service because you could interact a little more and provide a lot more information about the dishes on the menu.

I was really turned off by the crowds and noise at the brunch services but I am now definitely a huge fan of dinner at Mildred's!"}
{"text":"One must visit Mildred's if they are a true pancake fan. Their infamous blueberry pancakes are fluffy and drizzled with the perfect amount of syrup and blueberry sauce and a nice dollop of cream. Each mouthful makes you want to shove a bigger mouthful with the next bite!

The restaurant is situated in trendy Liberty Village, lots of paid parking around and its nice to take a stroll pre or post brunch. I've never had much trouble getting a table but then again I try to go right when it opens. 

Besides the pancakes, I tried the Huveros Monty and the scones. The beans between the tortilla was a little dry and I felt the salsa lacked some zing but overall, not bad.  The scones came with a fruit compote but personally I like to smear some Devonshire cream on my scones, which they didn't have. 

Next time I'm going to save all my stomach space for a full order of pancakes!"}
{"text":"I have wanted try out Mildred's for a while now, and saw summerlicious as a great way to make my first visit.  I have drooled over their menu online and was really looking forward to what I thought would be the first of many visits.  Unfortunately, although the food was tasty, however not all that warm, the service was so dreadful that I will not be returning and will make sure to pass on my horrible experience to my friends and family.  After taking our drink and meal orders, we did not see our waitress again.  She did not return to see how everything was, she did not return to take a second drink order, she did not return to take a coffee order before our dessert.  She had plenty of time to speak to the people she knew at a table of 2 a few tables in front of us for quite a while on each visit she made to that table, and she made many.  After she was done speaking with them, instead of going around and checking on the other tables she would return inside immediately.  There was another table that kept trying to wave her down to get their bill, but she just didn't look in their direction once.  They finally, much like us, had to ask the guy running food and clearing tables to get her to bring it to them, and we did as well.  When she finally brought the bill she didn't ask how our meal was, she just gave it to us so I couldn't comment on the fact that my chicken was barely warm, and waited for the machine to be returned, and didn't say thank you for the visit or the tip.  I am willing to accept that perhaps she was just having an off night yesterday, as we all have from time to time, but not even a thank you at the end of our meal and after we have paid our bill and her tip is simply just rude.  Based on the other reviews that I have read on Yelp it sounds like Mildred's needs to start paying attention to the service they are providing their customers, or else they will start losing more and not getting many new ones.  There are too many great restaurants in this city that are offering outstanding customer service, so don't waste your money here, unless you can tolerate slow service and inattentive waitstaff."}
{"text":"Went there with my hubby today and we both agreed never to go back again. The food was meh. The lady who waited our table was somehow not very interested in talking to us. The manager was really nice though and that was the only bit that made us feel welcomed. 

Hubby ordered The Manhandler and he was rather disappointed with the steak. I ordered buttermilk pancake and it was too sweet for me. We ended up paying a little over $60 and we both think comparing to the quality of the food, it was overpriced."}
{"text":"Meh, it's ok but I won't come back. I had greater expectations with the established Mildreds name. Very different from the original. Overall it is  very average for upscale and menu was good but unremarkable."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon around 1:30 Pm for brunch and this place was packed! Took our name and told us we would be notified via text once our table was ready. Got seated about an hour later (I advise you to go early as this place does not take reservations for brunch).

I ordered the Veda's choice (poached eggs on a fluffy croissant with rosemary bacon and mixed greens). Let me just say that it was amazing and worth the wait. The croissant was very soft and flavor in the toppings was excellent. In addition, I ordered a side of blueberry buttermilk pancakes. They are one of the best pancakes I've had, not too sweet and very fluffy/soft. 

I will be back again to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and delicious food. I thought we would have had to wait longer based on some of the other reviews but our group of six was seated almost immediately even on a weekend during brunch hours. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'll start by explaining the 1 star is due to the experience I had at Mildred's today. Food and waitress service were great so I would give them 4 stars.

I was part of a group of 8 people, we arrived at 11:40am and we were told due to the size of our group, we would have to wait longer than normal but by 1:30pm we should have our table. It turns out it wasn't until 2:30pm till we were seated. The hostess was trying to keep us calm but to say the truth, she wasn't doing the best job until the very end when we were all about to leave. 

She told me a couple of times that if I wanted to be heard by a manager she would call one for me, I never asked her to, as I figured one would come up to us and try to ease the situation. Even after we sat down no manager came to apologize, to explain, to listen to us, nothing. It's like this is a normal situation they go through and as a paying customer, this carelessness just made me feel very unappreciated. Our waitress did bring scones to our table which was nice gesture, but all I really wanted was for a manager to have more respect and consideration for his customers and come talk to us. I used to be in the service industry and I understand problems happen, however, there is no excuse on the manager being absent like he/she was."}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences here. The food is AMAZING, so delicious, so good, and it's super close to BMO Field and the Ricoh in case you're on your way to a game and decide you want brunch first. On the other hand, the most recent time I went here they forgot about us and about a bunch of the food we ordered and never apologized for it / didn't comp anything. We were there for like three hours and really hangry by the time our food finally arrived. Was it delicious? Yes! Was I mad as hell? YES."}
{"text":"I brunched here twice and both times was amazing. Every dish was very colourful, vibrant and very flavourful. The first time I came here, I had Veda's Choice (smoked salmon on croissant) and O M G .. theeeee best croissants I've ever tasted - definite must try if you are a fan of croissants and smoked salmon. Second visit, I tried the The Lottie Salad, which was also really good. 

The service was absolutely great. The staff was super friendly and very accommodating. The only downside is the wait that you may have to face - but that's just another indicator of how good this place is. Great music choice and environment too!

Definite must try if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"Very contemporary decorations, and the brunch options are fantastic - we ordered a biscuit and a scone, pancakes and today's special. All very good and tasty, especially the biscuit and the pancakes, best I have ever tried."}
{"text":"We've been here several times now, but usually for brunch. I love the open kitchen and feeling of the space.  The black pig is cool. Our recent lunch included the grilled calamari and nachos. I particularly enjoyed that they used lime in the guacamole as opposed to lemon. A unique take on both dishes.  The calamari were slightly undercooked, but didn't bother us enough to send it back. We actually enjoyed it enough that we didn't even notice until the plate was almost finished. A terrific eatery in Liberty Village. Ironically we weren't even in the area when we decided on lunch, but  the parking situation was so ridiculous in the city we decided to drive a little west just to avoid the aggravation. We found a spot right out front, making it oh so worthwhile!"}
{"text":"Came to this restuarant with my husband on a Sunday afternoon, was a decent A-OK restaurant. Large and spacious on the inside with nice decor and large windows. Wait times are very long for some reason, even though we spotted some empty 2 seater tables on the inside, you seem to not get seated right away even though there seem to be tables - you have to do your time and wait the specified period..... Part of me thinks that making people wait inordinately long amounts of time is a strategy restaurants use to create hype about the restaurant and the food (i.e., to get people to think the food must be really good because you wait so long and its sooo popular!) - though my theory could very well be wrong #SocialPsychology101! 

The food was pretty good but does not completely live up to the \"hype\". I got the Huevos Monty: flavours were tasty and presentation was nice (also quite rich as they slather it with cheese, sour cream, and whipped avacado), but portions are not very large considering the price, approx. $15 for the dish.  We ordered a side (i.e., one) of their famous pancakes - it was yummy,  pancakes are soft and fluffy, but it's quite rich and very sweet, I don't know how you'd eat the whole full-sized portion in one go.                                                                         

Overall, decent experience- pretty good food. But don't think I would go back for the food, especially if have to wait the 1.5 hours to get a table - I think there are better quality, hole-in-the-wall-type brunch restaurants in downtown Toronto with better food (and more bang for your buck) that you could get access to a lot more efficiently."}
{"text":"The Temple Kitchen
The food here was unbelievable. I have pretty high standards and am often disappointed, but was completely blown away. My friend and I started with the gnudi. I had the chicken naan & my friend had the trout (which we both shared). Both amazing. Apart from having to wait a little longer than I would have liked for the main course, it was truly heaven. My only complaint regarding the food is i found the amount of sauce on the chicken dish was just a little too generous. But that's hardly a complaint. The service was fantastic. The restaurant itself is beautiful, i really enjoyed the open concept design. We'll have to go back for dessert and their famous breakfast/brunch. I can definitely see myself becoming a regular here."}
{"text":"I want to start off saying I've had really good dinner service here before. Food was really good and so I was excited to come try brunch. This was worst brunch i have ever been too. The waiter came by once the entire meal. We waited at least 30 minutes for just water not to mention over 45 minutes for the food to come out. After waiting for an hour and a half to get seated, the least they can do is offer us some water.... Pancakes were overrated. I'm not sure if we got a bad batch but my pancakes were def cooked too long, it was slightly crunchy on the bottom. They were dense and not as amazing fluffy as reviewers say. I've had much fluffy pancakes at my favourite brunch place. Overall highly disappointed and will never come back for brunch."}
{"text":"Three stars because the experience was OK but I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm a fan. 

THE FOOD

I started with the \"Waldorf salad\" ($10), MTK's modern interpretation of the classic. While I appreciated the attempt to lighten it up by omitting the traditional mayonnaise dressing, their citrus vinaigrette combined with the tartness of the sour apple gave me a bad case of pucker mouth. 

I also don't like it when too many hands have touched my food; it's just a salad, not a jigsaw puzzle. I could tell from the overwrought arrangement of the cucumber peeled into ribbons, squares of iceberg lettuce torn just so, and uniform grape slices--yes, they even sliced the grapes--that someone had been pawing the produce like it was prom night.

Next up was the pan-seared Ontario speckled trout with roasted mushrooms, Swiss chard, celery root & walnut brown butter sauce ($26). On its own, I liked each ingredient but something about the combination of these flavors all together on one plate did not work for me, and instead of a crisp sear, I got flabby skin on the fish.

This sounds like it should be a two-star review and based simply on what I ordered, it would've been but I have to add another star based on what the S.O. ordered: shrimp cocktail and saffron-fried chicken. Both were delicious and I tried to poach off his plate as much as I could before I turned back to my own food in disappointment.

Another reason for the third star was dessert. Their take on the Baked Alaska was a confectionary dream; served as a slice, it featured lemon ice cream on a layer of sponge cake, and barely browned, fluffy peaks of meringue piped onto the top. It was a lovely, refreshing end to the meal.

(Note that their menu changes frequently and the above items may not be available at all times.)

SERVICE
Overall friendly and professional, although with one head waiter and two back-up waiters, you'd think someone would've noticed that they served us our starters before bringing us our $60-bottle of wine.

VIBE

The decor is ultra-modern and while this may appeal to some, it's not really to my taste. The recordings in the style of an in-flight announcement in their restrooms struck me as gimmicky. Like ha ha, I get it; the restaurant looks like a super-hip airport lounge but can I just pee in peace, please?

BOTTOM LINE: Some choose to pray at Mildred's Temple Kitchen, and, hey, that's cool, but I personally don't subscribe to her religion."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! The brunch was so so delicious! Our waiter was very nice. They even comped my pancakes since the food took a little while to come out. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First of all, I get that this place is busy at brunch. We put our names on the list at noon, table of 3. We had to wait 1.5 hours to get a table (wandered off for a while), the only reason I waited that long was because of the raving reviews from the group I was with. 

We finally got seated, waited 20 mins for water/drink orders, another 20 mins to place our order, and then another 45-60 mins to get our meals. By now, I'd have been ready to walk out. Our waitress wasn't apologetic at all, kept refilling our beers (maybe that's the reason for the slow service - sells more alcohol), so I'm inclined to believe this is typical wait times. 

When the food arrived, it was absolutely delicious. I loved it. I would have loved it even more if I hadn't been so starving that I barely tasted it as I shovelled it down. I don't want to go to restaurants where I have to plan to have a snack before I go there because the service is so slow. 

I probably wouldn't go back. Despite the delicious food (portion size was a bit small for the price, but it was fair trade coffee and organic beef so I'd pay extra for that - I guess it works out) the slow service just killed the experience. It's great that it's a popular place, but either have the right number of staff to take care of all the customers, or have less tables."}
{"text":"If you're not in a rush and you don't mind waiting, everything on their menu is fantastic. The wait for weekend brunch can get incredibly long. I realize it's hard to guess how long a line will take, but I think they usually say it will be an hour. Sometimes it only takes 20 mins (hurray!), and other times it's been well over an hour. Seriously, West Elm (a nearby home furnishings store) should pay them some kind of commission.

I definitely recommend starting with the current scones and buttermilk biscuits. I always order them and they never disappoint! 

The service is friendly, but the kitchen timing is all over the map. Sometimes we get our dishes right away, and other times we won't receive our main dishes until long after we've finished our scones and biscuits.   

The Heuevos Monty is light and refreshing, but deceptively filling. It's my favourite choice in the summertime, although you can't go wrong with Veda's Choice or pancakes. I think the rosemary bacon is a bit overpriced, but I'm a sucker for the rosemary potatoes."}
{"text":"Located in Liberty village, this modern spacious brunch place with high ceilings is definitely one of the new trendy places that most young professionals drift towards.  

We started off at The County General on Queen but as we were 9, there was only bar seating. There is noway we were going to do our MBA class brunch sitting in a row when the whole point was for us to catch up.

So we were seated almost immediately at a booth with a round table in the back.  I ordered the croissant with the poached eggs on bacon with a side salad and a side of sausages, fresh squeezed orange juice, and coffee. The food was good and the ambiance was nice, but the bill was $30 + tip so kind of pricey.  The brunch dishes were mostly $15-20, the orange juice was $5, and coffee was around $3.50.  We also ordered a basket of homade biscuits and blueberry scones with icing on top.  They were pretty delicious. But quality of the food and service was good. Staff was friendly and kept refllling our coffee mugs.  They also managed to do separate bills and split the biscuit and scones equally onto every bill.

Their blueberry pancakes looked really good and they have an option that's just eggs & bacon overtop a salad for those that desire brunch but yet want to lose weight and cut back on carbs."}
{"text":"Who is Mildred?
Who cares. The food is the important thing. In all honesty, it was a bit too hoity-toity for me. It was one of those places people go to so they can say \"Oh, look at me, I was at Mildred's Temple Kitchen having Frites ('cuz fries aren't classy enough) with aioli. Aside from that, it was definitely a nifty little gem. 
I had the curried cauliflower with spinach and caramelized onions and quinoa. It was scrumptious, and, broadening on Marie's observation, the mix of my entree and the unpronounceable avocado martini kept my palette guessing with ever-changing tastes.

I'd recommend checking it out. It appears to have a seasonal menu, so for the high price and irregularity of the dishes I will probably be going back next time the menu changes, just for a nice treat once every now and then, (and to make myself look classy)."}
{"text":"Made a reservation and had to change it. Called an hour before the reservation and asked to change it to the next day; person on phone said that they \"would take care of us\" we showed up for the reservation to find the restaurant closed. Felt taken care of.

Do not go here.

They may spit in food \"taking care of you\"

Plenty of places nearby that have customer service in mind."}
{"text":"We came to MTK for the valentines day dinner prix fixe, which is $48.

The food was amazing and the space is beautiful. I had the artcic char and it was hands down the best prepared arctic char I've ever had. Pan seared with the skin on, very flavourful. It had an amazing coconut chickpea sala beside it. The flavours were perfect. 

My date had the veal beef cheek. He was really impressed. I was concerned the portions would be small but we both were happy with the sizes of our meals. The beef cheek melted in your mouth. 

For an appetizer we had the trout (sashimi style). It was was just OK. Nothing special compared to the mains. The desert was a chocolate creme, but I found it too rich and I was too full to finish it. 

They also serve a Quebec beer that is supposed to be great, but it was sold out.

I wanted to comment on service, since there seem to be a lot of complaints. After arriving for dinner I found out that I had booked our valentines dinner on the wrong night (like an idiot). They still accommodated us almost immediately, and were very gracious even though this was clearly my fault. The staff was friendly and helpful. It did take a really long time for our mains to come out, but luckily the space is so beautiful and I was having such a great time with my date I hardly noticed."}
{"text":"Great brunch food! All the dishes the group ordered were fantastic! Long wait so make sure you go early. Recommend the The Lottie - \"It Keeps Me Thin, Mrs. Pierce\""}
{"text":"So after hearing such marvelous things about MTK I thought it was time to give it a try.

I headed there for brunch on a Sunday at 2pm-  The wait was 45 min.  

I figured it'd be worth it, so we waited.  Once we got seated, I was a little disappointed with the selections on the menu. It's very small, and well nothing is remotely healthy or really tasty sounding (to me anyway).

I went with the blueberry pancakes and a side of sausage.  The whole thing was mediocre.  I've had WAY better blueberry pancakes and at a much friendlier price point.  

The sausages were good, nothing to write home about.

I won't be returning.  With the plethora of great places in Liberty Village/King West area, it;s just not worth the wait and price.  Although I may pop in for a caesar, those lookd uber yummy."}
{"text":"Donna (the owner) is phenomenal - she genuinely cares about delivering quality memories over quality food.  She hosted our group last night, and I couldn't have been more impressed with her staff, chefs and her story!  

Highly recommend it - make sure you request for meet Donna and ask her about her career, it'll blow you away!"}
{"text":"What a cute little spot in Liberty Village.
I went last Sunday with a few girlfriends. The food was excellent and our server was friendly.
Service was quite slow, but this is understandable on a Sunday afternoon for brunch.
Huevos Monty was really good!!
I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I went to Mildred's Temple Kitchen on a first date last night because I had heard so many good reviews about the food.  Let me tell you I was not at all disappointed.  The decor of the restaurant is a large open space, and wait staff are attentive but not overbearing and really let you take your time.  Actually the girl who was waiting on us spotted that it was a date and asked if we wanted to move to a small booth and then brought us champaign on the house (which was awesome).  And the food was spectacular, so rich in flavours and filling at the same time.  I would definitely recommend Mildred's Temple Kitchen."}
{"text":"Delicious blueberry pancakes. It was very busy during the sunday afternoon. The scones were delicious as well but quite heavy. Hipster modern vibe with tenative servers."}
{"text":"Okay, yes, it's expensive, but I so love eating here. Been here 3 times now and every time I like it even more. Beautiful bright space (cheers me up on cold winter days), friendly servers and excellent, often local food. Brunch is my favourite--buttermilk biscuits (scones are fantastic too) with The Nettie (eggs on salad with bits of rosemary bacon). I love the huevos monty as well. The unbelievably fluffy blueberry pancakes will blow your mind. The coffee is divine (Reunion Island). I also came here for Winterlicious with my boyfriend and parents--we all had a different dish and shared. Can't remember the choices now but they were all good. Dessert--now that I remember! Sticky toffee pudding and affogato (ice cream and espresso)."}
{"text":"One of the best spots for breakfast or brunch! Amazing food! I tried the grilled cheese sandwich and OMG, both cheese and caramelized onions are melting together. Also, there are famous of their pancake. Surprisingly, they are thick but delicious."}
{"text":"Came here last month on Sunday around 10am. Didn't know it opened at 9am but luckily we didn't have to wait to be seated. Ordered 6 biscuits and it came with butter and something like strawberry jam. It was fluffy and moist. Ordered Veda's choice with smoked salmon and the infamous Mrs. Biederhof's legendary pancakes. Omg the blueberry buttermilk pancakes were amazing! It came with blueberry sauce and blueberries with whipped cream. Definitely the best blueberry pancakes I've ever tasted. You can even ask for more whipped cream and blueberries on the side. Veda's choice came with eggs Benedict on smoked salmon in a croissant. The croissant was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Everything tasted amazing. Couldn't finish it all so asked to package the leftovers. We had a very pleasant server (Asian girl) who was super sweet, always refilling our waters and checking up on us. Had a nice convo with her. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very satisfying feast. Had the brunch skillet and shared blueberry pancakes with Walshie. You know you're getting a good feed when you get brunch in a pan. It had plenty of egg yolks too which allowed it all to slide right down. The  pancakes were big and fluffy, juice from the blueberries on top allowed good lubrication. Altogether could be harsh on the buttocks but a good feed nonetheless."}
{"text":"Did the groupon deal! Probably the best meal I have had since moving to Toronto 2 years ago! Will definitely go back and try the wine flights :)"}
{"text":"I went for Sunday brunch I arrived just after 10:00 am (they don't take brunch reservations) and was told there would be a 20 minute wait. Luckily we arrived just before 30 other people did so going early might be your best bet. The food was good, the scones were amazing, I had the pancakes which were good but heavy since I ate a dense scone right before. I also ordered a side of bacon and I was surprised that the portion was so large that my dining partner couldn't finish it between us. I also had the house made iced tea it was good but the brew was strong and a bit bitter it may have not been made fresh that day. Overall this is a great spot it's large, the service is fast and they have excellent waitstaff."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, nothing too crazy or fancy and I'm a fan of not seeing the whole menu be some boring asian inspired fusion monstrosity. 
Service is excellent, and fast.
Last time I went my lemonade was from a machine...and I think for the price they charge you for drinks...I don't think so.

However, as good as the food is it is a little pricey."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with the hubby after hearing so many good things about it. It's been pretty cold lately so we decided to go early so we wouldn't have to wait in line. 

We ordered: 
1) Veda's Choice - I ordered this with smoked salmon instead of the bacon.  The croissant was delicious and fresh and the poached eggs cooked perfectly.  My only criticism was that the salmon was pretty salty.  Not sure if the bacon is equally as salty but the salmon's saltiness almost overpowered the other flavors of the dish.  Perhaps I would try it with bacon next time.  It also came with a fresh salad which was perfectly dressed with a light vinaigrette and made the dish feel very light.  The salad was good but to be honest, if my hubby and I hadn't decided to also get the pancakes I'd still be hungry after eating just this dish - it's definitely a light brunch dish.    

2) Big Skillet - My hubby ordered this as it vaguely reminded him of a brunch dish that we had in Halifax (Eggs Dante from Brooklyn Warehouse for all the Haligonians out there - but since BW decided to stop serving brunch, my hubby has never had the amazing Eggs Dante again and as a result he's always looking for dupes that can compete with that legendary dish).  As for the big skillet, he felt it didn't come with enough meat and was rather small.  I took a bite and felt that it tasted more of beans than of pulled pork or any other flavour.  Overall, he felt it was a mediocre dish.  

3) Blueberry Pancakes - These were SO GOOD.  Our server highly recommended them (and also the scones) and they definitely lived up to expectations.  Super fluffy and moist.  I typically don't like cooked fruit but the blueberries were perfect and the whipped cream on top was so delicious.  Pancakes are heavy when it comes to brunch items but for some reason, it felt so light in my mouth.  Of course, afterwards, eating 1.5 entrees, we were stuffed.  I had a good post-brunch nap on the drive home after this! 

I liked Mildred's.  The food was fresh and delicious and the service was great! I definitely enjoyed my time there.  However, it is on the pricier end of brunch places. Our brunch cost over $60 (not including tip).  So beware...not cheap but you'll definitely be satisfied."}
{"text":"Amazing blueberry pancakes (very filling, be careful) but other than that, not so great. The place is massive yet we (2 people) still had to wait half an hour to be seated. 15 minutes feels like an eternity when I'm hungry. Don't come here for breakfast/brunch if you love the classic bacon, eggs, sausage, toast goodness because none of that is on the menu. However, if you're looking for something over-the-top creative that mixes ingredients totally unheard of on a breakfast menu, then this is the place for you. 

I had the pulled pork skillet which had caramelized onions (I'm listening...), a fried egg (Yum...), and salsa with piri sauce (What the f...). I have nothing against spice, I love indian food even after my nose is running off the table, but this just threw off the dish for me. 

Our service got our orders mixed up (minor annoyance, it happens), but they also gave my girlfriend her pancakes like 10 minutes before I got mine (big deal, unforgivable). 

Prices were rather high and my skillet was smaller than an individual size pizza at Boston Pizza.

Some credit I will give is that they got our phone number and texted us when a table was ready so we could roam around liberty village, so the wait went by pretty fast."}
{"text":"Went there last night for Winterlicious, I'm going to review the food and service separately as it wouldn't be fair to the food. 

Food: My date and I both had the handmade Ricotta Gnudi for starters, it was an amazing dish. Main entree were the Chicken Biryani and Short Rib Pot Roast and both dishes were spectacular, the Chicken Biryani had a lot of different flavors on the same place (as my date explained to me). The Rib Roast was fall off the bone goodness. Desert we chose one each of the Bread Pudding and the Classic Profiteroles with Lindt ice cream. I have to say the Profiteroles was amazing.  For dinner, $35 for a set menu was a steal, drinks and wine are a little pricey so in the end I think we got a fair deal.

Service: Horrible, our first impression as we walked in the restaurant, we weren't good enough for the staff. The greeting from the Host was \"do you have a reservation\" granted it was Winterlicious, but a simple \"Hello, how are you?\" would have been nice. We had to wait in the lounge for our table and decided to get a drink at the bar, I stood at the bar for a good 10 minutes as the bartender was chatting up another waiter and although both saw me waiting at the bar, neither acknowledged me until they were done with their conversation and I'm pretty certain it was not work related. Our waitress, was even more horrid, never brought us bread even though she mentioned she would after we ordered drinks. We had to ask for it after we finished our entree. Our table was never set up properly, and it just seemed our waitress forgot about us.

The food and atmosphere at Mildred's is amazing, but service is a serious issue. I'd visit again to try out their brunch but if service continues to lack it could be the last I visit the establishment. Would have been 5/5, but 1 star taken off for the poor poor service and it wouldn't be fair to penalize the food."}
{"text":"Come for the blueberry pancakes (101% absolutely recommend), stay for the huevos Monty! So, so delicious. I would definitely make the trek to Liberty Village for Mildred's, no questions asked!"}
{"text":"I've eaten brunch and dinner at Mildred's a number of times as I live in the area. It has the right formulaic mix for a \"cool\", contemporary dinner spot -- nice architectural details, 'concept' washrooms, tasty and well-presented food, etc.  What's totally lacking is in the area of service. Although I like their Pastis-style attire, this is ultimately all that gives the servers any semblance of personality. They are totally unenthused, unengaging, and well... basically absent. I'm not sure if this is because they are short-staffed but it is frustrating to feel that you've been stranded at your table.

Another thing that totally mystifies me is how the portion sizes seem to change drastically from visit to visit...?

On a high note, the green eggs and ham on the brunch menu is exceptional."}
{"text":"I recently came here for their Winterlicious lunch with my friend David and let's just say...we came out with a huge smile on our face! $20 for three amazing courses is as good as it gets!

We both started off with the cauliflower soup with a hint of vanilla and crunchy croutons. I've been battling a nasty sore throat and this really helped sooth it because it was very creamy and went down really well! Small portion but the quality makes up for it.

David opted for the MTK burger which he loved! Although it looked small, it was very filling and he called it \"one of the great burgers he has had so far\". 

I ordered the lobster and scallop pot pie and i was so happy with it because it was CHUNKS of lobster and scallop inside. Definitely get this if you are battlingva sore throat like i am or just enjoy pot pies in general because you will not be disappointed! Did i mention CHUNKS OF LOBSTERS!

Lastly, our calling came when our trio of creme brulee came. who doesn't love creme brulee! My favourite was the espresso because I love coffee and it was an explosion of coffee flavour on your first bite. Of course my suggestion for this is to sample all three at once because it will help with the richness of the custard. I also will suggest maybe getting a coffee to balance the richness of it.

Overall, I loved this place. The service we received was impeccable (our server was extremely helpful and made us feel very welcome). The decor itself was an open concept which was nice and very comfortable. But the food...yum! I am now anticipating to come here for brunch (I think the blueberry pancakes are calling me!)"}
{"text":"I took my wife for breakfast to this place after hearing good things. Service was very friendly but ultra slow. I don't think it was the server, more likely the kitchen and bar. 

We ordered their Bloody Caesar which was awesome. You think you've tasted one you've tasted them all? Nope! This one stands out among all the rest! 

My wife had Veda's choice, I think it was called and I had the Big Brunch. Hers was very tasty, mine was ok but nothing special and definitely not BIG. We had a side of their rosemary bacon which was good but the real treat that made the meal was the side of blueberry pancakes. It was scrumptious!!! Thankfully they serve one pancake as a side bc I wouldn't have order a whole order. Next time I'm ordering it as my main. 

I will defiantly return, but do yourselves a favor and pic up the pace, some people were getting anxious waiting for their orders."}
{"text":"Had a delicious brunch Labor Day Saturday- our server was very good, she whisked us inside from the patio when our sweet food started attracting too many hornets. Also anticipated our needs for cream and sugar and water refills before we even glanced her way. The food was very good. Apparently we ordered the two most popular dishes on their menu- the Huevos Monty and the Veda's Choice. Nice open room concept with the most 'open' open kitchen I've ever seen. It's basically a stage in the center of the dining room. Nice large windows looking out onto King west. My favorite brunch place in the city was always Le Petit Dejeuner- it's still very good, but overall Mildred's we enjoyed slightly more. Oh, and the scones with apple compote are to die for! Order half a dozen and take them home with you!"}
{"text":"Mildred's temple kitchen is marketed as one of the met upscale brunch places within Liberty Village. I'm a review junkie so reading this, I knew I had to try it out. Ultimately, my experience was good. However there are a few things I would like to point out. When we got there (there were just 2 of us), we were told it was about a 30-40 minute wait. Knowing how popular this place was, we decided to wait. Mind you, we got there at about 12:50. We walked around and came back to see Many tables empty. We pressed on the employee at the front and she finally gave us a table. She was also telling others it was a 40 minute wait. When we got inside, we saw so many tables free. This seemed a little odd to us. We were the second people on the wait list and there were at least 6 tables completely open. The wait time doesn't seem to be accurate. 

Everyone raves about the blueberry pancakes. It's even on each employee's tshirts. I was excited to try it! However, I was extremely disappointed. Ever made pancakes at home with the Aunt Jemima batter and then just waited for a while before eating it? That's exactly how it tasted with some delicious blueberries on top. I understand that I may have just gone at a later time. But the fluffy and fresh taste of the pancakes was lacking. 

My boyfriend tried the huevos Monty. Now THIS is a dish I would come back for. Fresh, hot and delicious. You can't go wrong. 

I would come back to Mildred's. However, I wouldn't be a little bit more aware. This may have just been an off day. But that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"Finally made the effort to check out Mildred's after hearing nothing but rave reviews. Went for Sunday brunch. 

We arrived at 10:30am and had to wait about 15 minutes. Not too bad. An hour later there was a lineup outside the door. 

Not sure about mid-week dining, but the weekend brunch atmosphere is kid-friendly.

Ordered the \"Huevos Monty\" and it was decent but nothing to write home about. The blueberry buttermilk pancakes, on the other hand, are stellar and definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"We got the blueberry buttermilk pancakes and essentially died and ascended to heaven with each bite. It was glorious. 
The entire experience was made 100 times better by Pablo, our server. He was a delightful server and hilarious. He was patient with our indecisiveness, gave great recommendations and accommodations, and was wonderfully responsive."}
{"text":"Is there a reason why people like paying $20 (after tip & tax) for pancakes? I got the super hyped up fluffy blueberry ones and yes they are delicious, no doubt, but pancakes should not be more than like $10 (unless they ended world hunger or gave you a religious experience or something). Gorgeous atmosphere. I guess you're paying for that?"}
{"text":"This was an excellent stop for brunch. The blueberry pancakes were light and fluffy with toppings that didn't overwhelm with sweetness. Despite my server's caution that it was spicy I had the breakfast skillet which may have been a bit much to end the festive holiday season with. Speaking of our server a shout out to Pablo who did an incredible job!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect brunch spot.  Since it is the perfect brunch spot, it is bursting with people at every table and along the bar.  Be prepared to wait in line and dine in a noisy environment due to many simultaneous conversations."}
{"text":"Not worth the wait.. at all and for some reason theyre playing weird airplane sounds like what to do in an emergency.. weird"}
{"text":"I gave the place 5* for their pancakes,ambiance and staff. 
I don't order pancakes when I go out but I had to know what the fuss was all about. I had them as a side to share after our meal as suggested by the server. They were fluffy, thick and a little crispy along the edges. I can't have this as a whole meal as I would find it too much but sharing a side was plenty! I loved the ambiance of the restaurant with the large windows and open kitchen."}
{"text":"Well its Saturday night and we have reservations for 7:30 Its my first time in their new location. I had fond memories of great brunches and dinners in the old place back in the 90s..We couldn't find the restaurant an almost non existent unlit sign is on the road but you cant see it from the car ..we had to be directed in and we aren't that old and feeble and we both know liberty village it was truly hard to find but the girl was helpful on the phone..Great service at first by our waiter who should be giving great service considering the place was mostly empty. Big open space and lit well for the evening but kinda cold vibe.
We are told its a sharing menu we order the trout, some fries the mushrooms and the Flat Iron steak..the Steak was delivered cold and when i asked if it was meant to be served cold they immediately took it back..but that was the last we saw of our waiter!...He just ignored us after that we would have ordered more wine ..he just didn't show up again until we beckoned him for the bill..the fries were nothing special..not those delicate frites you get in a french restaurant..more Mcain fries style the aioli dip was nice..the mushrooms looked great were sizzling hot ..but swimming in oil not butter ..at least a cup of oily oil! The new steak was the old one i think they nuked it..because the original was medium, as i ordered, but the replacement was overdone it was served on a bed of crunchy Farro although our waiter talked this up as some sort of wonder grain,,truly it was a tasteless under cooked porridge that I didn't want to eat after the first bite.. there were bits of deep-fried kale on the plate oily and inedible not even pretty to look at..(maybe you weren't supposed to eat it??)portion size for 16$ was at best appetizer size but that was OK because it too was oily and kind of tasteless (maybe the nuking?) The trout looked good was very small served with a few pieces of parsley and some MORE OIL COVERED cabbage and barely any rice. We were not happy or satisfied when we left. And we both felt like we had been rolled in oil i had a tummy ache afterwards..Don't waste your money here the pretentious menu doesn't even live up to its own pretension. And how about serving a decent vegetable with your proteins guys..would it kill you to cook a zucchini or anything green other than deep fried oily kale??"}
{"text":"I've been to Mildred's a few times on a week day for brunch, and although the food is always delicious, I've had consistently bad service.  Not only does the restaurant always seem understaffed, but  the server consistently seems to forget about my table. When asking questions about the menu, the staff seems unsure and flustered. 

Overall, It's unfortunate that such a nice brunch spot in a great location is ruined by bad service and confused staff."}
{"text":"All the hype about this place is true. Friendly sincere service. Cool upbeat ambience. And most of all, fantastic food. Go. Now. But go early, because unfortunately the thing about line-ups is true too!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this place was just a couple years ago and, at the time, it was quite good. The food was delicious, the restaurant seemed clean and bright. However, it seems to have been declining in quality ever since. 

Upon arriving for our latest visit, we were seated on the left side of the restaurant where I found myself sitting uncomfortably on a cloth bench cover that looked as if it hadn't been washed in ages, if ever. Water glasses arrived covered in dishwasher grime and fingerprints. 

While the staff are friendly, they don't seem to naturally meet the tone of the table and can come off a bit too sales-y at times. This could be the result of trying to maintain such a large establishment while depending primarily on a brunch service and waining dinner crowd.

Despite missing the mark on some other aspects of the experience, the food is always delicious and though I miss the short rib that they used to serve, they do a lovely job creating a balanced menu from season to season. 

I hope they're able to revive the charm and quality they once delivered. It would be a shame to see a place with such potential shut down."}
{"text":"We went Friday evening and did the Love per-fix dinner.  Food was very good.  However, the courses came WAY too quickly.  A $200 dinner ( food, wine and tip) should take more than 1.5 hours.  So rushed we were not able to proprerly enjoy the food or wine.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Outstanding decor. Generally great food, but they can be inconsistent. Service is adequate but there is room for improvement. Some servers are excellent, others are tolerable.  Well-priced, exciting creations, excellent location. If you are going for brunch, do not leave without ordering a scone."}
{"text":"Mildred's Temple always has great food and a warm, bustling atmosphere.  We typically have dinner there 2 or 3 times each year and I have reviewed it very positively before.  I am pleased to report that it continues to be outstanding.  We were there most recently for Winterlicious and their $35 prix fixe 3-course menu was terrific.  We had smoky tea-cured trout and Pork Rillettes as appetizers.  The Rillettes were very good.  The trout was fantastic. For mains we had Coffee & Black Olive Caramel Beef Short Ribs and Fried Chicken with crisp rye waffles.  The short ribs fell off the bone and melted in your mouth.  Perfect.  The fried chicken with waffles was also excellent.  Both items are on their regular menu and I would highly recommend both.  Desserts included Sticky Toffee Pudding and Earl Grey Poached Pears.  Again, both were hits.  Our server was very friendly and welcoming.  Service was excellent throughout.  Located in Liberty Village, Mildred's Temple is off the beaten track for visitors staying in downtown hotels.  Probably a 15 - 20 minute cab ride and longer in rush hour.  But well worth the trip.  Or be adventurous and take the King Street streetcar to get to dinner and take a cab back to your hotel.  I assure you that it will be worth the effort."}
{"text":"Came at 9:30 on a Sunday with a party of 5. We got a table pretty quickly but the place got packed within an hour. This is also the type of place that won't seat you unless the whole party is present so keep that in mind. 

The menu includes a good variety of food types. Not just carby american style breakfast. The pancakes were buttery and amazing. Other highlights include the pulled pork skillet and croque Madame special. The portion size was good to feel full after a single entre.

Service was attentive. But for a party of five it took a bit of time to reach the table."}
{"text":"No kidding, this place IS hard to find. Located on Hanna Street, there actually doesn't appear to be a real Hanna Street, but just know that it is in the plaza with the Metro (I know, weird, eh?) and right by the GoodLife Fitness and LCBO. And if you've wandered onto the GO Train tracks nearby, you've gone too far.

I and a couple of Yelp chaps gave this place a try on their Summerlicious Menu with a $35 dinner. 

The interior is absolutely beautiful, and tucked away in a part of Liberty Village that is pretty much as \"secluded\" as downtown Toronto gets. Really great for dates, as many of the clientele were. The interior decor is amazing and airy, tons of windows to watch the sunset and trains go by, mostly open kitchen,  - the kind of place where I like pretending is my own pad and all those fabulous people are my rich husband's fabulous friends.

Waiting for the rest of my party to arrive, something worth noting is the nice library-esque sitting area, complete with magazines and Annie Liebovitz books. A nice alternative to the stand-up bar. Toilets, or \"toilettes\", rather, are unisex with cool wallpaper, well-designed individual stalls and sinks - which at times came across as the 'try-hard' part of the design, but still a good effort.

Service was a bit on the slow side, and we noted that the server outfits were a little bizarre - white dress shirts, jeans, and black athletic soccer-like shoes. Casual gone wrong, basically. The food, however, was quite good and came in comfortable portions. The highlight for me had to be the app - seared white tuna sitting in a deliciously flavourful broth, bits of chopped vegetables and topped with a pinch of sprouts - a wonderful combination of flavours and textures.

The entree - veal brisket - was slightly less inspired. There was too much meat and while parts of it were tender, other parts were a bit too chewy. The flavour was expected - meaty - and paired with a large piece of ravioli, altogether too many strong flavours. My tablemates seemed to enjoy their fish, but I'll let them Yelp about it.

For dessert, their famous profiteroles - tasty, not too sweet, and just the right amount after a hearty meal.

All in all, the main draw of this place is the interior design of it and if you're looking for a classy but comfortable date place, this isn't a bad choice at all.... perhaps worth a second visit to try their brunch?"}
{"text":"One of the two main brunch places in the liberty village area. They waited and saved our table even though we were running late for our table. Thank you! 

Lot's of veggies come along with your brunch plate. The portions are a little on the small side though. But otherwise food is good. 

Best thing about the place is the decor and atmosphere. Very open and airy layout."}
{"text":"Trendy place for brunch any day of the week. Cute patio during the summer. Although its small, I never had a problem getting a table.
Have been here a few times and the quality of food never deceives. I usually order the brunch skillet, which is savory and spicy. The pancakes are also a must have."}
{"text":"Besides the waiting time...HOMEMADE SCONES...'nuff said."}
{"text":"Went here for the start of winterlicious 2016 and I was not impressed. 6.5/10 at best. 

Starters:
Gf had the pur√©e, she said it was the best thing of the whole meal, however did not taste any crab in it. 
Mine was the pork. It looked and tasted very similar to spam. It was cold. The mustard was strong

Mains:
We both had the panko. The chicken was well cooked and very good. I really enjoyed this out of the three plates. The potatoes we nice and hot and good. The cabbage was BAD, we both had one bite and pushed it to the edge of the plate. 

Desert:
Gf had the cake with pecans, she enjoyed it but said it wasn't anything special. It was warm. 
I had a COLD s'more with no actual gram cracker... Not impressed at that one. 

Service: 
Top notch. Sweetened my gf drink for her, gave us time to talk between plates, constantly checking up on us, the hostess actually saying hi and bye.... The service is why I rated as 'high' as I did. 

I would come again but never on winterlicious, there are other places that serve great meals regardless of the event."}
{"text":"Man was this place something else! Came here for my Anniversary dinner with my Girlfriend and enjoyed their 4 course set. It was amazing especially with the cooler fall night, their food was fitting the mood! Started with a french bread soup followed by Ox tail gnocci, centred with a roasted chicken + vegetables + potatoes, and finished with a lindt chocolate affogato.

All of the dishes served we presented well with the soup being poured from a kettle (interesting!)

The service matches the expectations that surrounded the restaurant and we loved the server who covered our table that evening. 

I will definitely be returning though at the price point offered it will have to be a once in a while outing."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all. The service was pleasant and warm. My boyfriend got the Huevos Monty, which he liked. He liked it even more when he added hot sauce to it. I got the blueberry pancakes with a side of rosemary bacon and honest to goodness, it was such a treat. Blueberries are not a favourite of mine but they tasted just right with the pancakes. It wasn't too sweet, it wasn't too overwhelming, it wasn't too wet, but we would have preferred a more generous drizzle of maple syrup because we were running out towards the end. The pancakes are definitely shareable between 2 people."}
{"text":"After having read great reviews about this place, I finally decided to have (my first!) brunch here. We arrived around noon, were told to wait around 30-40 min for a table and that we would receive a text when they were ready. We waited, watched people who arrived after us get a table, waited some more, and then at the 45 minute mark we went in and bam, got a table. Okay then.

So we sat down, received our menus, but we already knew what we were going to order. We had 45 minutes before to plan this. We were going to go ALL OUT. About 10 minutes passed and it appeared we were forgotten. No one had greeted us, told us about the specials, or even gave us water! We flagged down a staff member for water. Okay, got that done. What about our orders? We asked if there was someone serving the patio, and were told she would arrive shortly. Well, she didn't. We had to flag someone to take our order. Shortly after that order, a woman, who I assume was the waiter that didn't show up earlier finally arrived. Our stomachs were doing the talking now so we ordered a third dish and two sides.

She appeared a bit flustered and sorta judgmental that we ordered a rather large amount of food for two people. Well, maybe if we hadn't waited so long we would've ordered just two dishes like civilized people. Fortunately the wait for the food wasn't too long, but the poor service certainly left a poor taste in our mouths that carried throughout the meal.

So, the food. The pancakes were probably the best I've ever had: fluffy, warm, not too sweet. Loads of blueberries on top. The Manhandler and Veda's choice (with smoked salmon, yum) were good too but not as great as the pancakes.

As delicious as it was, it wasn't worth the poor service. Very sad first brunch experience."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. I've never had a bad meal here and the service is always friendly. 

If it's your first time, I would recommend the burger and/or pancakes; they're your \"safe\" choices. 

My only complaint is they don't have a good system to facilitate their availability for weekend brunch. They are insanely busy at this time and your wait time has a high variance (40mins - 3 hours)."}
{"text":"This place was awesome ! The ambiance is so nice, clean/fresh feel! The kitchen is totally open which is a huge plus. We had many food places on our quick trip to Toronto so only ordered the fluffy blueberry pancakes, which were out of this world! Deff one of the best blueberry pancakes I ever had ! Must come here when in Toronto ! Friendly staff as well !"}
{"text":"Good for brunch.  Busy, great service and good food.  Dinner on a different occasion was less than steller."}
{"text":"What a fantastic venue and a superb and accommodating staff. Our father didn't eat beef from the fixed Mothers Day menu and they were so kind enough to run out and grab one for us. The waitress made friends with our child and we all had a fantastic dining experience. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here for b'lunch on a monday. In short everything was super super tasty but if you ask me, I think the biscuits were even better than the scones even though I usually like scones more. Also we had the famous blueberry pancakes, they were very good but the portion was HUGE, and they do get too overwhelming after a few bites because they are extremely rich and sweet, so I would recommend sharing between at least 2, or maybe 3 people. The atmosphere and interior decor was amazing and service was also super friendly."}
{"text":"This place can be super packed on the weekend so make sure to get here EARLY for PANCAKES. 

I cannot emphasize that enough. PANCAKES are the way to go. They have the best blueberry pancakes I've ever had. Their food is made fresh and I enjoy the simplicity of the menu. They have freshly squeezed juice as well. I went on Canada Day weekend and they were doing a fun promo where if you sang the anthem, they would pay for your food or something like that. I don't envy the brave souls who would step up to sing for the whole room. 

Their staff are pretty friendly except the girls who manage the front of house can get stressed at times. The waiting policy is they take your number and text you when your table is ready so I can imagine it must be a bit of work when there is a long line. 

Overall this is a lovely place to eat. A bit on the pricey side but I would definitely come back for more pancakes."}
{"text":"This modern and bright restaurant offers the best brunch in town. The blueberry pancakes and spicy Caesars are particularly special."}
{"text":"Stopped in at 11am on a Sunday and was prepared to wait. We were told the wait time would be about 1hr-1h15 so we decided to walk around and come back. They sent us a text about 45 minutes later telling us the table was ready. 

It was our first time here and we decided to get the highly popular buttermilk pancakes and the big b'lunch skillet. It took about 30 minutes from the time we ordered until the time the food arrived to the table. The  server kept coming back to check up on us though which was great. 

Damn... The pancakes were delicious. It came with 4 pieces. They were super fluffy, and the blueberry compote with whipped cream went very well with the pancakes. 

The skillet was also amazing. I asked for mine with over easy eggs (the only way to really have eggs) It was cooked to perfection and when mixed together with pulled pork and potatoes it was so good. Ask for the in house made scotch bonnet hot sauce as well! 

Overall it was a good experience and in my opinion it was worth the wait time."}
{"text":"Blueberry. Pancakes. I'm SCREAMING just thinking about them. They're so fresh and before you know it, your plate will be clean. I can't describe it accurately enough - just eat them!!1!"}
{"text":"Waited 1.5hrs for a table and the pancakes were way overrated. For $16 it really was nothing special. It sure looks super fluffy but it wasn't a very good texture. My boyfriend got the smoked salmon poached egg croissant. It was good but small and the croissants at my local bakery are better. Everything is premade. I saw a huge tray of poached eggs and bacon waiting to be ordered and assembled... Service also sucked. Waiter was nice at first but when a bigger group came in he totally ignored us after taking our order. Someone else brought our food and he forgot our coffee."}
{"text":"Amazing Brunch spot! 

A friend and I went here saturday morning around 9:45ish, no line up and seated right away. This was our first time and we've been told that brunch is a high demand thing so it was pleasant to know that there was no wait! I'm sure this doesn't happen every time but certainly helped with the experience.

We sat outside since it was very nice out and a somewhat scenic \"industrial meets urban\" view of liberty village. Their tables outside are communal, so if it's the two of you, its possible you may seated right beside another pair. Aesthetic grass decor on the tables make for divider on the table. 

The food...
PANCAKES, PANCAKES. PAN...CAKES. Please get them. Don't ask questions. We didn't want to go overboard with our first time so we decided to share a few plates. We shared two biscuits, Veda's Choice and the Buttermilk Pancakes. The biscuits (soooo flakey and moist!) came with a poppyseed jam (delicious and light!). Vedas Choice with Smoked Salmon was delightful and flavourful (I could definitely eat this on my own). The buttermilk pancakes were MUCH bigger than pictures make them seem! I'm sure if I was hungry enough I can finish this but quite glad we chose to share this. They are fluffy and topped with a very light whipped cream and blueberries. This would definitely be my go-to at mildreds :) 

The staff were very friendly! And our server was nice + polite and very eager to help us since we told him it was our first visit!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! The pancakes, the Avocado Wrap, the Smoked Salmon Croissant - seriously good stuff! Someone recommended this place to me and I'm so glad they did! Great prices also! Definitely would visit again"}
{"text":"Worth the wait! Had to wait an hour for a table for brunch so we wondered through some stores. They texted us once our table was ready. I got the skillet and the person I was with got the pancakes.
I don't even like pancakes and I would have eaten their whole plate! The fluffiest pancakes you will ever have. They love them! We have tried all the well reviewed brunch places and these pancakes deserve the spot of best pancakes in the city.
The skillet was fantastic too! Looks a little small at first but it is so full you don't know where to start. The salsa in it was a freshing mix with the beans and pulled pork. 
Would definitely be coming back in future."}
{"text":"Definitely overhyped. We waited a little bit over an hour. WE got there by 12:40 and were seated at 2:05 The hostess kept greeting me as she had never seen me and asked my name three times every fifteen minutes. Once seated, the waiter took another 10 minutes to greet us! By now we were starving and we had memorized the menu so we knew exactly what we wanted. We ordered the scones to get started which took another goof 10 to 15 minutes, who knows why. Yes, the are great,but 10 to 15 minutes?  Then, another 10 minutes to bring our main dishes. I had the poached eggs which were good, not great and my wife had the Huevos ... Which were below average. Reminded me of a Nachos dish. The tortilla was lukewarm and a bit hard, the guac was really good and the beans we ok, but nothing to die for. 
All in all, this was a two and a half hour, dreadful experience. The service was abysmal, the wait too long and the food was simply good. If the place was empty, sure, I would go again, and you have to try it, but I would never wait in line to get in. No even ten minutes."}
{"text":"it was birthday night around Jan 7 2010 , the four of us headed in , and in the maitre d went to Asa alternative school of the arts with my daughter.  He even remembered it was her birthday for some reason and brought us 4 flutes of champagne on the house!.  The appetizers, main course were very good but the three desserts were outstanding.  For a Thursday night it was busy and the service was incredible.  although see #1  lol........washrooms are a hoot!  great place."}

I've been wanting to go back to Mildred's Temple Kitchen ever since my last visit. My first and last time at Mildred's Temple was for Summerlicious with a friend and that's when I fell in love with the restaurant.
Although I was eager to go back, Liverty Village is out of the way for me so I waited until Mother's Day to bring my family over for brunch. I was surprised to find out that they didn't take reservation so we decided to go a little to gurantee us a table without having to wait too long.
When we arrived at the restaurant, there was a line forming at the door although it wasn't even open yet! I normally don't really care for brunch so I thought to myself that it must be soooooo good that people are willing to give up that extra hour of sleep on the weekend for their food.

Ordered: Scones & Biscuits 4/5

* two for $6 or six for $14
* Baked fresh every morning
* Luscious currant scones or flakey buttermilk biscuits 
* Served with homemade preserves
* These arrived nice and warm at our table
* We decided to go with currant scones
* They were a little flakey than I expected but still very delicious
* Currants added nice fruity taste in between each bite

Ordered: The Lottie - \"It keeps me thin, Mrs. Pierce\" 3/5

* Frisee salad with over roasted mushrooms, rosemary bacon for $12.95
* Topped with your coice of 2 eggs poached or sunny side up
* This was one of the lighter options from their brunch menu
* It was basically a salad but with eggs on top which made it 'brunch style'
* I wasn't a big fan of this dish but my family enjoyed it

Ordered: Veda's Choice 5/5

* Mildred's classic poached eggs on a flakey croissant for $14.50
* Choice of smoked salmon or rosemary bacon topped with Bearnaise sauce and served with mixed greens
* This is one of the popular brunch dishes at Mildred's Temple Kitchen
* I went with smoked salmon and I loved it
* It is quite heavy given that it is served on buttery croissant
* I would get this again but maybe share it with someone else

Ordered: Mrs. Biederhof's Legendary Light & Fluffy Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes

* Served with Lanark county maple syrup and whipped cream for $14
* Honestly I am not a big fan of pancakes although I do crave them time to time
* These were very fluffy and light, perfect with whipped cream and fresh blueberry
* Since it was a 'lighter' pancake, it felt more like dessert than a meal
* Nonetheless, very good pancakes and I would recommend them

Summary: Overall I really enjoyed brunch at Mildred's Temple- I just can't get over their restaurant and the way it's laid out. I don't know if I would want to wake up early and line up to get in for the brunch, but I will def be back for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Two of us went on Sat. afternoon for brunch. 

Scone and biscuit -- ok. homemade apple sauce was good.
Crossant -- delicious. only the portion was a bit small for men. my bf had to order something else.

I had something like mashed potato with gravy and cheese on a pan. It was tasty but heavy. After half of it, I had to give it to my bf to finish.

Two latte -- so so.

Total was about 65 including tips. I may go back again since food is pretty good and the atmosphere is awesome. Beautiful indoor and friendly service."}
{"text":"I finally ate at Mildred's!!! This isn't because I haven't tried before...I have tried 3 times to eat brunch here and each time has been an insanely long wait; HOWEVER, this past sunday me and my lovelies were there early enough to only have to wait 30 minutes or so. WORTH IT.

We ordered the pancakes to share (sort of like an appetizer) and holy yum; do that. I never order pancakes because I tire of the flavour and heaviness rather quickly, and they hardly ever come with accompaniments so sharing was the perfect answer. They are heaven on a plate. For my entree I had the huevos monty and omg that is my jam. So, so good. 

You're gonna wait a long time, but its going to be so worth it, you'll forget all those tables of 4 you saw filled with only 2 people which you were cursing under your breath while you were waiting for your table of 4, for 45 minutes."}
{"text":"I've been waiting in line, name on list, for an hour. People seated ahead of us, that arrived after us - simply waiting for \"available tables \".  Terrible hostess, extremely rude."}
{"text":"Wow this is a must try for everone what great food.
I had the best Brunch in my life. It was that good."}
{"text":"I have this endless love affair with Brunch so I'm always on a search for a new brunch place and this has been on my list to check out for quite some time now. Finally this weekend, I chose the place for an overdue reunion with an old friend which worked out perfectly as she said she had come to this place but because there was such a long wait, the rest of her party didn't want to wait. Although we did wait for about 30mins, there are tons of places at Liberty Village that you can pursue while awaiting for a text from MTK. Ahh technology. 

My friend and I both had a Cappuccino which was nice. What I liked most about it was the fact that you're given the option to add Almond Milk. Although the additional charge is a little steep ($1.25 from what I remember) it was still nice to have that alternative. Let's face it; almond milk is the new soya milk. 5/5.

[Main] 
Veda's Choice - Definitely a great first choice. It's an eggs benny but rather than the traditional English muffin, you get a nice a flaky croissant. You also have your choice of either bacon or smoked salmon. I had chosen the latter. You receive a generous amount of smoked salmon that's thinly sliced. The slices of salmon were then topped with perfectly poached eggs and hollandaise sauce.  Sometimes the sauce is so \"yolky\" that it feels its glued to your teeth. That could also just be me since I'm obsessed with my teeth and I've read before that egg yolk is one of the worst things for your teeth. Anyway, the sauce wasn't too \"yolky\" and also had just the right amount of lemon. The croissant itself was perfection. The side of greens was also a nice compliment to the eggs benny. It has just the right amount of acidic dressing which complimented the hollandaise sauce and also the runny yolk (I'm salivating right now!). I'd definitely go back just for this. 5/5.

[Sides] 
Chorizo Sausage - Because it was just a croissant, I was concerned that I wouldn't be full enough since it's light so after much recommendation, I ordered a side of Chorizo Sausage. Not sure if it's homemade or what but it was incredibly delicious! Casing had that nice pop to each bite and the meat itself was full of flavour. 5/5."}
{"text":"Confused. I think this place is way over priced, especially for brunch. After waiting for over an hour and a half for my food, my toddler fell asleep so she didn't get a chance to try anything. Ordered Veda's choice with salmon, the hubby got the Chicken Avocado Club and we split the blueberry pancakes. Didn't order any drinks just had water. The food isn't THAT amazing. Over hyped, over priced and way too long of a wait time on a Tuesday afternoon."}
{"text":"Me and my friend waited for a long time for our meal to come and they forgot our drinks. The most surprising thing was there was a hand soap/detergent taste like thing with some fries. The restaurant didn't care much and did not even apologize. They just took the fries away, asked if we wanted another one or just take out the fries price in our bill. By the way, the pancakes weren't that special."}
{"text":"Although the location is a bit obscure without GPS, The interior design of the place is very nice. The outside patio, although small, had a relaxing ambience to it.

The brunch menu is only one page and is easy to read/look at.

The servers are friendly and always willing to help.

However the pancakes we orders were very buttery and sweet. They serve three portions, but after one and a half we felt very much full and nauseas.

For some reason they were playing airplane safety instructions in the washrooms. Found it really odd. When I asked a server why they do this, she responded with \"no reason really..\" ... Ok?

Will check it out once more for dinner."}
{"text":"It's pretty okay. Overpriced for what it is, but if you need a place in Liberty Village to take your mom for brunch and you don't want the lines, this is the spot. Nothing to get excited about, but you won't have major objections either."}
{"text":"First time for me to visit mildred's for brunch. Heard great things about the blueberry pancakes, and someone not being a person of pancakes they were definitely delicious. Modern vibe to the interior, lots of natural light livens up the place. It is a 40-60 minute wait. Pink mimosa was spilt on my friend, manager and staff were very accommodating for the mishap. I did order the buttermilk biscuits to go which are delicious as well, but was disappointed when I got home to find scones were provided instead, hence the three stars. The scones are good too, was really looking forward to the biscuits though."}
{"text":"Looking for the next best brunch spot? Mildred's Temple Kitchen is a great option ONLY if you can handle long wait times during weekends. I had the pleasure of dining here on a Tuesday and was seated right away. Don't get me wrong, the place was still bustling with people with only a few tables open. We just got lucky! 

Right off the bat, I loved the clean and polished decor and the wait staff were all well-composed and friendly. After browsing through picture on Yelp (yes, that is how I decide what to order), I went for the Huevos Monty and the Legendary Fluffy Blueberry Pancakes to share. 

1. Huevos Monty ($14.50) - Mildred's classic black bean refritos & sharp cheddar baked in flour tortillas & topped with eggs sunny side up with fresh salsa & avocado creme fraiche smothered on top. I asked for hot sauce on the side and let me warn you, this is the HOTTEST sauce ever. I can usually handle spicy cuisine, but this homemade hot sauce is out of my range.. The rest of the dish was wonderful on its own - I could have done with less beans and less sour cream. 

2. Mrs. Biederhof's Legendary Light & Fluffy Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes ($14) - served with Lanark County maple syrup & whipped cream, this dish is the BOMB. I would come back here just for these pancakes. They are surprisingly fluffy and slightly toasted on the outside. We couldn't finish all the pancakes and had them packed up.. even when microwaved the next day, these blueberry pancakes were still delicious. 

There are still plenty of dishes I've yet to try, so I'll definitely be back! They only take reservations for parties of 10-14, otherwise wait you shall!"}
{"text":"Nom, nom, nom!!!!  Brunch heaven!!!!

That is all I have to say.  Yes, there will be a line-up on the weekend; so expect to wait or arrive early.  The tables do turn fast so your wait is not that long.

Go with the pancakes, they are DELICIOUS!  Warm, fluffy and melt in your mouth goodness.  The scones are lovely too.  They have a savoury selection too if your sweet tooth isn't on.

I will definitely be back for future brunches and might also check out their lunch/dinner menu."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here and I have to say the blueberry pancakes are still absolutely amazingly delicious. I don't even like blueberries but I love these pancakes. 

They are definitely a must try!

I also tried Veda's Choice with the smoked salmon and the way all the flavours come together is just perfect. 

The whole vibe in the restaurant is very chill and I would go back again for sure. As a bonus the service is great as well."}
{"text":"Brunch here is always delicious. We had the manhandler and Vedas choice. Both great. We were going to order the pancakes to share but we were too late. Order them as soon as you get there."}
{"text":"Never have I visited a place with a staff that's so overwhelmingly hip. The hiring criteria appears to be hipsters, only. It was mind boggling, but that's okay. 

my MTK burger was decent. It didn't come with cheese, which i also found mind blowing. The world is a dull place when burgers go cheeseless. It was well spiced and well cooked. I liked the thing overall. It was kind of small for the price. 

I get the feeling MTK is going for really gourmet. They want to offer smaller portions for higher quality. I'm okay with that, if it was outstanding, but it just isn't. It's pretty good. That's all. If I never went again that'd be fine. I wouldn't cry. My life wouldn't be somehow incomplete. The portion sizes should be bigger, unless they can up the quality. 

The food took forever to come. That's alright I was among friends, but just for the record, dreadfully slow. 

Upon conclusion of the meal I just longed for something more. Perhaps for mildred to materialize and felate me, who knows."}
{"text":"My friend and I waited one and a half hour to be seated on Sunday during brunch time. The pancake and all the food we ordered was very average, I would even say the pancake taste awful. We were disappointed and I don't get why people give such good reviews, maybe the chef was just in a bad mood on that day? If I knew the food was like this, I wouldn't even want to wait for 10 mins. Oh, the only thing I liked was the rosemary potato, that's it."}
{"text":"I love this place! The blueberry pancakes are delish, the staff are really friendly and attentive, and the decor is very cool. Make sure to come early for brunch on the weekends as they don't take reservations (brunch is first come, first served)."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, friendly staff who made good menu suggestions.  We don't come often but we come out every time satisfied, full and planning our next visit."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Best brunch in Toronto! I love their grilled cheese, pancakes and huevos. Definitely worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"2nd time at MTK. Appetizers (gnocchi poutine and nachos) were good but the MTK burger was terrible. The crispy onions were greasy and soggy and the burger was way too salty - and I like salt so for me to say too salty means really salty. My husband felt the same way. Not once did anyone come to ask us how our meal was during our main course so I couldn't even let them know it was not good. Service seemed a little slow. Was not overly impressed."}
{"text":"The Blueberry pancakes are a bit underwhelming... missing cinnamon.  However, their grilled cheese with apple chutney is to die for.  Only thing is, the portion is too small for the price.  But very yummy.  Best GC i've had.... overall great food but the wait does suck (over an hour for a table on a Saturday afternoon) and the prices are not a reflection of serving size. PS my partner had the Huevos Monty and it was super as well....again, very small for a large man... anyway, the side of potatoes did not come with ketchup, but the tea selection is very good ( try the white rose!)  Service is good and it's an open kitchen!  Yay!"}
{"text":"I have always read about this place so finally decided to make the trip over to eat here. The place is gorgeous! Beautiful and spacious. The service was attentive but not in your face. Food was well presented and the portions were good. We had the buttermilk pancakes ( probably the best ones I have had outside of my kitchen) they were thick and well dressed with fresh Creme and blueberries. The eggs Benedict smoked salmon on a croissant was very nice. Though the salmon was fishier than I have had before. Hopefully it wasn't bad(!). 
One star lower than perfect score because of the salmon."}
{"text":"We came here on a weekend (no reservations allowed). Was told it was a 45min wait for a table or 10 min wait for bar seating, so we sat at the bar. We were warned it was cold there and boy were they not kidding! The food totally made up for it. London fog tea (earl grey with steam milk froth) was delightful. Had the brunch feature which was beans, ham, eggs and sauce in a hot skillet.Mmmm. Fiancee had the Manhandler with side of potatoes. Decor is very modern and fancy af. The clean washroom had an Air Canada in-flight announcement recording regarding safety features lol. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about it and was craving for carbs so I thought I'd try it here today. I am giving one star because the food was good portion and quality but the service was terrible. It was not even that busy being a weekday but there was no hostess waiting to sit me when I went in, so it was confusing. When I sat down and was going to order a drink they didn't have a few seconds to wait for me while I was choosing my drink. Then it took them forever to come back. I had to ask for my tea and biscuits twice each. When the bartender brought me the tea the saucer was dirty with a half inch tea stain on it so I asked him for a new one and he never bothered to bring me one. They never brought me a new knife to use for the main dish when they took away the one I used for jam either. I wasn't gonna wait around for who knows how long, so I just took one from the next table. I think fast food places treat you better. I'll do take out if I ever want to eat their food again because I can't stand their rude service as it ruins my appetite and dining experience. I don't want to tip these people who don't do their job to earn it but expect it. It's a shame when the service does not match the fame of the restaurant. The pancake was nice, but I don't think the food is so much better than other decent breakfast places in town that I'd wait for hours like people say they do. Thankfully I didn't have to wait in line, but I can't imagine how much more horrible their service would be when they are busy."}
{"text":"Went for the b'lunch with a group of 4 right at 11:15 am. We only had to wait in line for 5 minutes, but a lot of people before us had reservations (you should make reservations if you do the b'lunch so you can get a nice table in the main area)! We were seated in the high chair areas near the bar and ordered Veda's Choice, Huevos Monty, the Big B'Lunch Skillet, and the FAMOUS LIGHT & FLUFFY BLUEBERRY PANCAKES (o m g). Veda's Choice has the option between bacon or smoked salmon - it was good, but on the heavier side. Huevos Monty was pretty good and although it looked small, I was surprisingly really fully after. The Big B'Lunch skillet was flavorful and also looks small, but actually really filling. BUT LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THOSE BLUEBERRY PANCAKES. PLEASE, PLEASEEEEE order them. They were so light and so fluffy, and I have to say the best pancakes I've ever had in my entire life. They were a little crispy on the outside and somehow even with all of its fluffiness, was still so light. Overall, great place and the interior was really nice!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has an awesome atmosphere and the lay out is very open with an open kitchen. 

We started off with scones and biscuits, the scone was fluffy and tasty but the biscuit was by far the best! It was flaky and buttery and tasted amazing with the strawberry jam! They were 2 for 6, which is an awesome deal. 

Our main meal we ordered the big b'lunch skillet and the manhandler! Man were they good! The medium rare steak on the manhandler tasted amazing with the sourdough bread, egg and steak sauce! 

The skillet was also very flavorful! It had a lot of potatoes black beans and pulled pork. It's really good if you want more of a Mexican vibe.

Overall this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Pancakes are delicious, eggs benny is not to be missed (they serve it on a croissant!), I've been numerous times for brunch and lunch but dinner was not up to par in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times but this review is for brunch. I put my name down at 10:40 for a table for 4, they quoted a 40 minute wait, and we waited for an hour. That's fine, we walked around the area while waiting for the text. The space is large and open with lots of sunlight coming in through the windows, which is lovely.

The drip coffee is unlimited. Stay away from their almond milk: it curdles in anything, and when you tell the waitstaff, they say \"oh, it does that sometimes\" like this is a common occurrence. Maybe warn people, then? I haven't had almond milk do that before so they need to switch brands. I had to ask twice for regular milk to replace it, but I can say our waitress was nice through it all. 

The biscuits and scones were quite good. I preferred the scones myself but a couple of my friends preferred the biscuits. The homemade apple butter was amazing. I also had the grilled cheese and substituted for the rosemary potatoes. Such a good call. Every bite was divine. I took advantage of my friend's small appetite and tasted the blueberry pancakes as well. It was so yummy but quite soaked in syrup and therefore very heavy. It was worth it, though. 

Don't forget to check out the washroom. Their choice of soundtrack is interesting."}
{"text":"I went there for there much raved about blueberry buttermilk pancakes. I already had read reviews that I would have to be waiting as it is extremely busy. So I went in and there was an hour wait, but I was happy  to know that they text you once they are ready for you. So it's good to just go and have your name on the reservations and then wait outside or go for a stroll around the area. The buttermilk pancakes are $16.00 they are pricy but they are VERY filling I could not eat them all alone! My daughter and I shared even then we had left overs. The staff is superb, extremely friendly and fast. I would defiantly be going back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Mildred's so many times and each time I am so satisfied with service and food. My favourite things to start off with here are their biscuits (their scones are too lemon-y for my liking) and the Poutine with Oxtail, sooo good. My favourite entrees are the Manhandler and the Veda's Choice. The Huevos Monty aren't bad but it has too much sour cream for my liking. The pancakes are amazing which is why they're famous for them, but the entree with 3 of them is way too heavy for me, so I prefer to order a single pancake as a \"dessert\"!

I also have to speak about amazing service here! The waitresses are so friendly, and the one time I went and a waitress forgot to bring my friend and I our drinks, she brought out a box biscuits and scones for us to take home and when the drinks did eventually arrive, they were on the house. I appreciate it when businesses prioritize customer service, and I love Mildred's for this!

The only thing I don't like is that they don't take reservations on weekends (which leads to hour long waits) and the last few times I've had the Veda's choice it has come on a croissant that looks like a mini size...when I sent a picture to my friends they even asked if it was a mini! Besides that, Mildred's is still my favourite brunch spot in the city!!"}
{"text":"Brunch is just 2nd breakfast 

Dropped in to mildredstemplekitchen finally to try out their famous Blueberry pancakes! Ended up getting savoury cheese tarts and fries w/garlic aioli! .

Setting: lovely! Very cute seatings! 

Pancakes were AMAZING .. unbelievably good! Well done! Tart was delish! Soft and just MELTED in your mouth! 

Fries - uh. Guys the fries were weak - had nice color but soft and bleh - but the Garlic Aioli was stupid good! 
I like how the server asked how was it but when I told him fries sucked he just \"smiled\" lol. .

DEF must go again tho! So good 

 Missing a star because not Halal :("}
{"text":"This spot seems famous for brunch, but we couldn't get in. So we decided to try dinner. And I have to save it was lovely. Food was delicious and the service was great. On a Saturday night, it wasn't crowded at all, but the place has a very chill atmosphere. Great place if you want a nice leisurely dinner."}
{"text":"Mildred's has always been one of my fav brunch places in Toronto. I am not the only one with this opinion as the weekend wait times reflects this (1 - 2 hours).

One of the must try dishes are the blueberry pancakes.  They are incredibly fluffy and tasty. They are topped off with a delicious whipped cream and maple syrup.

All of their savoury dishes are very good as well."}
{"text":"Very overrated. Ordered the frites and chicken club sandwich and the frites were super dry. Too much salt. Tasted horrible, my 3 year old couldn't even eat it with ketchup. Not coming back. Also wait time was 35 mins then the food wait time was an additional 40 mins. Was starving. Even after the food was finished. Horrible. 10/10 would not recommend. Going to Harvey's across the street now"}
{"text":"My go to brunch spot in my hood. Service is always great. Beautiful venue, lots of natural light, great patio. My regular order: The Lottie, a side of homefries (which are super crispy), side of bearnaise sauce for dipping. Scones and crumpets are good BUT are inconsistent. Sometimes they arrive warm and fresh, sometimes they don't. For that, I'll give this a 3.5."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good!!!! Great atmosphere and lovely space. The wait was long but worth it and the area is great to explore. 

I took my mom for Mother's Day brunch and the place was packed! We waited 1.5 hours and only got seated when my mom went to ask how long was left and struck up a conversation with the hostess. The food arrived very quickly. I got the pancakes and she got Vedas Choice. The pancakes were super fluffy and delicious - although the topping had fallen off the side of them and there didn't seem to be much blueberry on top. The portion was really good and we ended up taking some home. Vedas choice was also really good! We got side potatoes and they were great. We took some of those home as well. 

The Mother's Day brunch included a box of cookies to take home and they were spectacular!!! Possibly the highlight. The box had so many cookies and they were all really really good. 

Overall the brunch was delicious and the place is very nice. It cost $30 per person and was a little bit on the expensive side, but since it was Mother's Day... It was just the little things, like the wait time or the toppings on the pancakes, were what made me give it 4 stars. Definitely recommend for Mother's Day or any other day."}
{"text":"Love the huge windows and ambience at Mildred's! Cute location in Liberty Village. Scones and blueberry pancakes are my favorite, and the skillets are pretty great too. Expect to wait a bit on a weekend, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"1/5 stars for hostess service. We arrived at 11:15 am on Sunday for brunch and was informed that the wait would be an hour and a half which is fine knowing the volume of customers Mildred's attend to and because it's the norm for wait times for brunch in Toronto. I left my name and number for our party of two as they said they will send us a message when it is our turn and happily headed to Aroma for a light snack and coffee while we wait.

By 1:00 pm, we still didn't get a text or call and we thought it was a little odd and I was wondering if the number I provided was correct. We decided to walk back to Mildred's and spoke to the hostess explaining to her that we didn't get a text or call and we've been waiting for nearly 2 hours. They told us that, we didn't claim our table within 15 minutes of receiving the text message so they took our name off the waiting list. I wasn't so happy with this as I never received a text message from them. Fortunately, the head hostess sat us at a table shortly after.

5/5 stars for our server! Our server was amazing (he has this adorable British accent) and was super attentive. He took our drink order and scone/biscuit order quickly and came back to take down our orders. He was a very timely man.

3/5 for food. The food I ordered Veda's Choice (smoked salmon, egg, croissant) and he ordered the Manhandler (steak and eggs). My order was alright aside from the smoked salmon being unusually salty. His steak was ordered medium rare but it was cold when it arrived. I understand it won't be pipping hot as it is medium rare but it definitely should not be cold. We understand that they're a busy establishment but knowing that you're usually packed on Sunday.. are you short on staff or something?

Overall, we were pretty disappointed with Mildred's. They used to be so much better. I felt kind of embarrassed as well as I kept telling the mister how much I love Mildred's for their food and service. I ended up apologizing to him and hope that he'll still give them a try... one day."}
{"text":"The. Best. Blueberry. Pancakes. Ever. Period.

I dare anyone to find me a set of blueberry pancakes that are better than these. This dish is probably hands down one of my favorite dishes in Toronto. The freshness of the blueberries on top. The cream. The amazing local maple syrup. The fluffiness of the pancakes. The overall sweet taste but not overly sweet to get tired of it by the end. I seriously cannot express myself anymore. This is a must have at this place and you would be making a huge mistake if you leave Toronto without getting this dish. And to top it off, the blueberry lemonade was a nice pairing to the already blueberry dish.

Seriously. Get this dish. You will regret it if you don't."}
{"text":"WHAT A EXPERIENCE!!!! My fianc√© and I brunch all the time and we have yet to find a place we can whole heartedly say is the best place to have brunch....until we ate here! Hands down best brunch we've ever had. From the pancakes to the best cup of OJ I've ever had. I can write a novel on how delicious it all was. I can simply say it was a brunch culinary experience! The service was beyond perfect! Please when you go ask for Pablo. We just wanted to take him home with us he was so sweet and personable! He wasn't just a waiter, he was like a friend serving us brunch in his home. The wait is usually long so just be patient, I promise it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for date night. Big mistake!!  

First problem, TFC were playing and the place was a mad house, everyone scrabbling to find  parking.  Note to self- never, ever go to the \"Village\" on game night unless you going to the actual game. Finally found parking , 25 minutes late for our reservation. No problem , the place was almost empty.  

Second problem. We ordered glasses of the pinot. Sorry all out. Ok lets go with the cab. Finally after what seemed like an eternity,  we get our wine. Well, it was the first time ever I had  to send the wine back. Flat , off and just gross.  Well, after what seemed like another eternity we get our wine, just in time for food. No pre dinner drinks, thats ok , mom always said better to eat while drinking. 

Problem three. Food was ok, good portion size but not as good as it should have been.  So we decide to order more wine, that will make things better.  Nope, finished our dinner, still no wine. Waited  an extra 10 minutes, no wine  and no server.  Finally the server shows up and says \" oh no I forgot your wine\". No thanks, too late, bring us the bill. 

Problem four. Bill comes, wrong bill.  Some time later the server comes back and says \" oh no I brought you the wrong bill\".  Pay quick and get out the hell of there. 

I was so looking forward to a great Friday night date night dinner, but instead turn into , why did we come  here kind of night. 

Brunch may be a good thing here but dinner sucked. 

Too bad!!"}
{"text":"For the longest time, I had sorta heard about this fancy breakfast spot that was driving people crazy near Liberty Village. But I don't think I ever really made the connection, and then, like many businesses that you read/hear about through Yelp, they fade into the noise of all the places you mean to visit (Thank goodness for Bookmark Collections).

Then a couple of years ago my mother-in-law, knowing how much I enjoy cooking, gave me THE breakfast/brunch cookbook which shared many of the super secret recipes that have made Mildred's Temple Kitchen famous; Huevos Monty, Scones/Biscuits, Mrs Bierderhof's Blueberry Pancakes, Veda's Choice and many others. This cookbook has made me a hit when we invite friends over for brunch, so much so that we've had friends ask when we're having them over again for brunch.

After making use of this book for quite some time, I decided that with my birthday coming up it was special enough of an occasion to brave the long lineups, and no weekend reservations for a chance to try the dishes I'd long been emulating at home.

The trick here plain and simple is to get here early, put your name down (make sure your entire party is present) and then go grab a coffee nearby while you wait to be called/texted that your table is ready. If you plan to arrive after 10:30/11:00 am on the weekends you're looking at an hour wait regardless of your group size. I told my family to arrive at 10:30 but I would be there at 9:45 am to \"get on the list\". I felt like I was 22 again planning to get into a hot nightclub... but this is brunch son, this is more important than loud music, scantily clad patrons and overpriced drinks - there's no messing around!

It's a gorgeous open concept space with a full open kitchen to the two-tier dining room. The restrooms are gender neutral with private stalls and a communal wash area. And apparently, if you've got about $20K minimum spend you can even host a very small wedding/reception here - believe me, we inquired (thanks but no thanks).

We all started with Mimosas because... BRUNCH, and took our time ordering while we sipped and cheers'd one another and munched on an order of their scones served with apple butter - WOW! 

For my main, I went with Veda's choice, which is their spin on an Eggs Benedict. Except instead of peameal bacon they use regular bacon (but butcher quality), bearnaise sauce over hollandaise, and pack it all in a croissant rather than on an English muffin. Served with a fresh garden salad it was a lighter choice as the portion of egg/croissant was quite small, but was rich and flavourful. I only wish they had a second serving because my meal was effectively done in less than 5 minutes.

We also did a fair amount of sharing since we all wanted to try a bit of all the meals. My fiancee ordered the Huevos Monty, and it was outstanding and tasted EXACTLY how I had been instructed to make it. We also had an order of the famous blueberry pancakes ordered for the table so everyone got to try at least 1/2 a pancake. Let me tell you, while easily the thickest and most delicious p[ancakes I've EVER had (like mini cakes), I don't know how anyone tackles that pile of carbs on their own Wow!

Everything was as I had hoped for, the hype was real, and they even brought out a tiny chocolate mousse for me to honour my birthday (so nice). A perfect brunch in every sense of the word and I'll be looking to return many more times! 

Come hungry, come early :)

Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Came by for their b'lunch menu on a weekday and gladly, there was no wait at all. Obviously, I bookmarked this place to try their famous pancakes and being 12 30 I only wanted a taste so I found that you can get single orders for 6 bucks a piece. This was great news since what I received was a huge buttermilk hot cake fluffy, sweet, and drowning in syrup (not always a bad thing). It was definitely decadent and tasted like eating cake so having half of this plus their chicken avocado club which was also great helped me feel less indulgent. Their club had an entire chicken breast and only a thin layer of avocado and bacon making it a healthier but delicious choice! It also came with some salad (or fries if you prefer) completing the meal. We also tried their manhandler which was essentially beef strips on bread with two eggs on top. It was huge and I only had a taste but the beef was cooked wonderfully. Still nice and pink, very tender and tasty, my brother really seemed to enjoy the dish and had trouble finishing it. 

Overall, to me, the pancakes lived up to the hype! Prices are a little high but we were pretty filled with this meal. Only reason for no 5 stars is that the pancakes were a little bit too sweet and service was a bit slow (just the cooking part) which does show their freshness but I was hungry... 

Definitely more of a 4.9999 without a round up!"}
{"text":"Does this place need more reviews? Probably not. But heck, I'm going to write one because I was pleasantly impressed by this place.

Unlike most people that raved about the pancakes, I think the Brunch Skillet was my fave. Pancakes were great- don't get me wrong- but I think about that Brunch skillet more. The spices in that were so incredible that I left the place and immediately went to the grocery store to find what spices they combined to create such flavorful aroma! 

Service was very quick so we had the pancakes probably within 8 min of ordering (granted the wait to get seated took long). There's a Metros that isn't too far away so kill two birds with one stone and do your weekend grocery shopping after you put your name down. They can call your phone to let you know when it's almost your turn so you can also walk around- I appreciated that :)"}
{"text":"Great food.  Service is also very good.  Been here twice and can definitely say that this will be a frequent choice of mine.  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a Saturday Brunch, and as expected the wait was about 45mins! 

We decided to wait as it was a place we really wanted to check out.

We wee promptly seated when our reservation was called and they were quite attentive to us.

Food:
I had their version of eggs benny - the sauce and a wonderful coconut kick and I can totally
understand why this is a top pick. The croissant definitely added the perfect texture to satisfy my craving!

My friend had the skillet and said it was extremely full of flavour. She enjoyed every bite!

Service:
Our server was amazing, he was attentive and patient. Took time to explain items and had no problem repeating himself. Came by to check up on us as soon as the dish came out and then part way through with no pressure!

Definitely enjoyed my experience here and I'll be returning and recommending :)"}
{"text":"The decor is so cute! Very open concept and breathable (which is a good aesthetic aide during a hangover lol). I ordered the Huevos Monty which has black beans, cheese inside 2 tortillas. Its topped with salsa, guac and sunny eggs ($15). My food was yummy and the portion was more than enough for one person. 

My friends ordered the pancakes (which were FLUFFED to the heavens) and a croissant sandwich which was also delicious. Our server was happy and friendly which of course makes the experience that much better.

2 thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"This rating is purely for the pancakes.
Is it the best in Toronto? I don't know I don't usually order $16 pancakes. But the portion amount is overkill. You can probably share each pancake with 2 others. 

The texture was perfect. It had a very nice muffin top crunch on each side of the pancake. And it's nice and fluffy on the inside. It was wonderful. Combined with the syrup and the blueberries, your mouth will experience and body will experience euphoria. 

Would I wait 1 hr for them? Probably not. But I know it's a must try dish.

TIP - ask extra syrup on the side. Trust"}
{"text":"I was at Mildred's on Saturday for a friend's surprise birthday brunch. Though we couldn't make reservations, and waited 2 hours to be seated, I have to say it was all worth it.

First of all I love the location, Liberty Village is a beautiful neighbourhood. The restaurant itself is open concept, with a lot of natural light pouring in. You can see the kitchen, and how happy the cooks are preparing the food- one was even dancing behind the counter!

I had a cappuccino and their legendary pancakes. Their cappuccino was smooth and delicious, and their pancakes were so filling! Every bite was heavenly, especially since their pancakes were topped with fresh whipped cream and blueberry compote.

Our waitress, Jenny was also very professional and friendly, which made our experience that much better.

Overall, I loved the restaurant. Next time I'm getting \"Veda's Choice\", and coming back at a less popular brunch time to avoid the long wait."}
{"text":"My number one favourite brunch place for pancakes!! But this time I ordered Veda's Choice with the smoked salmon while he got the pancakes. The poached egg on mine was perfect, and even produced the perfect egg porn shot for my picture! Veda's Choice was like eating an eggs Benedict except on a croissant instead of an English muffin. The croissant is so flaky and soft, so good!! And for the pancakes, you can never ever go wrong with ordering it. It's the fluffiest and most delicious pancakes we've tried yet! It's just a HUGE portion so you probably have to share it. We also got greedy and ordered the rosemary bacon, for me it was a bit too crunchy ONLY because I like my bacon chewy, but FHubs loved it. And that's all that matters. Service can get a bit slow here, due to how busy it is. But it's ok we don't mine, simply because of how amazing the food is here."}
{"text":"Had a great brunch here.  Everything on the menu looked fantastic, so ordered a meal each and pancakes on the side!  It all tasted as good as it sounded on paper. We will definitely be back.  Expect a wait for a table though."}
{"text":"Yessss. Yesss to everything. Im a sucker for kale ceaser and there's is large and in charge, add their house smoked salmon. Boom! And don't forget their signature pancakes for dessert! Ohhh and their scones... Mouth watering. Ive been here many times, always worth the trip across town.
I will say, get an Americano not their drip coffee.....
But everything else is 5 plus star!"}
{"text":"This is a regular spot for me to take my client's for lunch as well as overnight weekend gusts for brunch. I love the atmosphere, food, and wait staff are always friendly and attentive. My 2 favorite lunch menu items are the MTK burger - a handcrafted burger, topped with tomato relish & crispy tobacco onions, served on a pain au lait bun with salad or frites, and the Gnocchi Poutine - tender potato dumplings smothered in oxtail gravy & baked with artisanal cheese (there's always a fight at the table for this which I usually order to share)."}
{"text":"YES the brunch is worth the hype and the wait. 
The interior is gorgeous with the natural lighting.
The food looks great and is delicious.

My boyfriend ordered their famous blueberry pancakes. They were thick, and he was a fan. He gets pancakes at every place and he really liked these.

I had the poached eggs on smoked salmon on a croissant. It's like an eggs benedict but way better because it's on a croissant. Quality croissant too."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The only reason I'm giving it one start is because I can't do lower. The food took forever to come and so did our coffee. The pancakes were horrible and the blueberry sauce was even worse."}
{"text":"We came here based on the original Mildred Pierce restaurant reputation that we used to really enjoy. The meal was excellent I have rarely been at a dinner where four people have raved as much about each of their dishes. The aromatic flavours were pronounced. Between the short ribs, roast chicken Briyani, mussels and soup everything was excellent. The atmosphere was casual, prices reasonable and overall a great experience. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"A Generous serving of great pancakes with friendly quick service, the wait time to get seated can be up to an hour but that is expected for a good quality brunch location."}
{"text":"One of the best Brunches ever.  The fluffiest pancakes you've ever seen.  Scones so delicious you wanted more but knew it would be too much coupled with breakfast.  Sausages so tasty you wanted more but knew it would be too much coupled with scones!  And fresh juices.  So delish - we will totally be back!"}
{"text":"We came to visit Canada and came upon this popular place. It was a long wait but well worth it one of the best breakfast I ever had and I mean it !"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday 12:40pm - wait time: 1hr 20mins. 

The area has a lot of seating to rest while you wait for your table, with Kitchen Stuff Plus, LCBO, Boutique Home stores, Global Pet Foods and a lot more to visit.

As we approached our 1 hr wait time (even on a beautiful day), our patience was getting tested.

Food worth the wait...?

Tried:  huevos Monty (tortillas, refried beans, sunny eggs, creme fraiche), Veda' s choice (croissant with bacon and home fries), famous pancakes, and scones / biscuits.

Pancakes: yes, very good, and One bite will eliminate any stresses from waiting! Now, they do offer a \"half size portion\" for $6 but you only get one pancake. At $16, 3 pancakes is obviously more value, but I do feel one pancake shared between 2 people is more than enough to have adequate tasting and enjoyment. 

Huevos Monty: I originally wanted the Brunch special, but it was sold out, and this was listed as a Mildreds famous dish. Excellent. The Beans are much tastier than the ones you'd see at Chipotle and thank God for that. The salsa and creme fraiche pairing mixed with everything else is perfection. *MUST* GET THE HOT SAUCE!

Veda's Choice: croissant was tasty and I kind of wish you could order them plain (maybe you can I just didn't try asking), but the croissant loses its taste mixed with the egg yolk and bacon. The potatoes were yummy with chives instead of rosemary! 

Scones/Biscuit: yea nothing more to say here, if you don't have room for them, get them to go! Perfect balance of butter, flakiness and nothing over powering! The sauce was great!

Obviously waiting for more than an hr for a table is scary but with how popular and tasty the options are here, its clear why.  Don't go in expecting to eat right away, and grab a menu while you wait! 

Make sure you get the side of got sauce as it is truly a gem here!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Modern architecture. Nice breakfast. Huevos eggs n Veda's choice breakfast was to die for. Pancakes were off the hook as well. Very close to my place. Will definitely come back. 
The waitress was super professional and lovey. Her name was Claire."}
{"text":"It's a nice restaurant, food was ok. However it didn't meet our expectations, it is definitely over rated. After sitting down at our table we waited 50min for our food,  I really don't mind wait in a reasonable range, but wait for this long is unacceptable which is the main reason of the disappointment. Currently, we are waiting for our bill for around 15min and counting up :( 

understaffed? Maybe."}
{"text":"The previous attempts to come here for brunch had been futile due to excessive wait time. The other preferred option ended up with the same dilemma in the prior tries. This time we decided to attack the situation early so with an acceptable wait time we finally made it. 
The space is open and has a pleasant feel till one is seated. I guess the seats are OK but the upholstered seating is showing sign of wear and tear and need a change. I knew what I was going to get (buttermilk pancakes due to fellow Yelpers review and friend's recommendation). My friend opted for the burger. Apparently there is an option to order a side order of pancakes as well so there you go if you just want a taste go for it. 
The beer list is poor as the beers mentioned on the other reviews were not available anymore and the draft selection is limited.  I ended up with a below average mimosa. The food took its time to arrive, the service was decent as we were checked on regularly. 
On to the main event the pancake though visually appealing was nothing to write home about. Maybe its mass produced now and doesn't have the secret ingredient of care and luv anymore as it just didn't do it for me. The center was quite dry and had a chalky taste. The burger was decent according to my friend. 
I would say a 3 star for brunch despite the never ending lineups."}
{"text":"I had the obvious choice - Mrs. Biederhof's blueberry buttermilk pancakes.

Wins: light, fluffy pancakes worthy of all the attention. Not too sweet with just the right amount of blueberries and syrup; friendly customer service; great atmosphere

Cons: kind of pricey for pancakes.."}
{"text":"My favourite place for brunch! Their pancakes are super yummy and fluffy. 

* I usually book a table to avoid long waits to get seated."}
{"text":"It's my happy place

Mildred's Temple Kitchen is like my little cloud 9.  Although I have come to dislike that phrase due to recent misuse...so how about we call it my little slice of heaven.

It's a welcoming, white, bright, open space of love.  Truly, it is.  A  perfect weekend haven on Hanna Avenue where friends, lovers, and strangers come to smile and eat.

This past Sunday, on one of the coldest days of the year, a few us gathered for brunch and started with the Biscuits and Scones.  We all agreed that the currant scones on the left were far better than the biscuits on the right, which isn't to say we didn't eat them all, we did.  Not a crumb was left behind.

I had Mildred's benedict - two perfectly poached eggs and lox on a flaky, buttery croissant...

But true happiness came in the form of the best blueberry pancakes in Toronto:

Mrs. Biederhof's Infamous Light and Fluffy Blueberry Buttermilk Pancake

They REALLY do make people happy :) 

Mmmm...what heaven tastes like."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the service and vibe here! I came here for a birthday breakfast on Saturday. They won't give you a seat until everyone arrives, I was okay with that but once the hostess found out it was my birthday, I guess she felt bad that the birthday was waiting alone at the front, so she gave me a table. She was so incredibly sweet and nice to everyone who came in.

Our waitress was also super nice and attentive. She wasn't checking on us as much when the place got busier, but totally understandable.

The food wasn't crazy amazing or anything but it was a respectable place to have brunch. Both the pancakes and veda salmon were good.

I would totally come back for the experience and service, the food was pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Sunday morning brunch, waited an hour for our group of 6 to be seated, as expected. There were plenty of shops in the area to keep us preoccupied. Once we got the text to come back, they allowed us to take our Starbucks inside, which was nice! 

Atmosphere was clean, roomy, chic, and bright. Front of house were impatient but the wait staff were extremely friendly and helpful. 

-Veda's choice $14.95: 2 poached eggs on a croissant. I chose the smoked salmon and upgraded to the potatoes $1.50. I thought I might not be full but I was super happy with the portion. 
-scones and biscuits for the table 6 for $14 which were nice and flaky but in my option nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"Three reasons why I would never go back to Mildred's Temple Kitchen: 1) I asked for medium poached eggs and was told that's not an option (only soft or hard poached) to reduce work for the kitchen. Seriously? You've decided to start saving time on preparing eggs? Eggs are the most integral part of most brunch dishes, and it's pretty normal for people to have different preferences when it comes to how they'd like their eggs done. That's like going to a steak restaurant and being told you can only have your steak rare or well-done. 2) I agree with some of the other reviews that their seating system makes no sense. So many empty tables, yet the wait was over an hour. The table we were seated at was surrounded by three empty tables for the entire hour we stayed, yet when we left there was a long lineup outside. (And they don't take reservations for brunch, so those tables couldn't have been reserved.) 3) The food was nothing to write home about. The sauce that came with my dish had interesting flavors, but my side salad was bland and the rest of my dish was barely lukewarm. All in all, a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"This is my favorite brunch place in the entire GTA! The service is excellent - I've been on numerous occasions and all the servers have always been polite, friendly, and helpful with taking the order and providing efficient service. Once there was a problem with my order, and the manager promptly took the item off my bill - no questions asked. 

The place has a nice high ceiling, brightly lit atmosphere and is a great spot for dates or group gatherings with friends. 

I've only ordered the famous blueberry pancakes and the fries, and I have to say I've never had better pancakes in my life. Basically you get a stack of three perfectly done pancakes on a bed of maple syrup, and on top is a generous helping of the lightest cream and blueberry that you can imagine. For a dish that's so heavy, the pancakes feel surprisingly light! And if you've got a sweet tooth, you can ask for an extra shot of maple syrup. 

Even when I move from Toronto to another city, I'm going to fly back here just for Mildred's because I have yet to find a brunch place I like more than this one!"}
{"text":"10 Stars for the Blueberry Pancakes. Simply one of the best things I ever ate. Thanks to new Yelper JC for introducing me to Mildred's. The breakfast / Brunch is incredible.

The GOOD...

- BLUEBERRY PANCAKES. If given the choice for a last meal... this would probably be it. Big portion - check,        Fluffy soft moist pancakes - yup,         Filled & covered with mountains of sweet fresh beautiful blueberries - better believe it,         Whip cream melting over the top - damn right and delicious warm maple syrup - indeed. PERFECTION.

- The homemade scones. This is the real deal. Once again 5 stars are simply not enough! The scones are made the traditional way, not the fake stuff at coffee shops. A must try.

- Service was fast, efficient and friendly.

- Love the look of the restaurant. Reminds me of a huge loft. Cool patio in the summer.

The only negative I can come up with is the long waits on weekends. That said - the pancakes are worth waiting in -20 cold for two hours.

By the way.... did I mention the pancakes are good?


Tip - go on a weekday around 11:30 if you don't want to wait.

{"text":"Lives up to the hype - spacious and great service. 

I've been meaning to try this place for years. Finally, I made it here, on a weekend afternoon. I gave my name walked around the area for an hour and came back to find my table ready.

The waitress was so friendly. The scones were way too good perfect and fresh out of the oven. Now the pancakes ARE good but it would be a bit too much for one person to finish it on their own. So, id recommend you split it, or get ONE pancake as your side order if that's what you want.  All in all, a great brunch!!

Great for families, accommodating for young children and babies."}
{"text":"Beautiful and spacious interior. You can see the kitchen area as well since it's out in the open. 

I got the Vedas choice for brunch. It was so flavourful, filling, yet light and delicious. You also get a choice of side salad, or rosemary potatoes OR half and half, which is what I got. 

The rosemary potatoes are amazing. If you ask for ketchup, you get a really good homemade bowl of ketchup served to you. The ketchup is the perfect amount of flavour. 

The bathrooms here are unisex. Bright and spacious. Also there is a loop of airline sounds track playing in the stalls which I thought was interesting...

The staff were super friendly and awesome. We got a couple of scones upon our departure, which was a lovely little bonus. 

I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been to MTK before and had a great experience. Today? Not so much. Went for Summerlicious lunch with three friends, two of whom needed to return to work after the meal. Things started out great - the appetizers were delicious. However, an hour and 15 minutes after we sat down, we were still waiting for our entrees. Our server said nothing, and we had to flag her down before she noticed we didn't have our food. She went to check but my two friends had to leave - one ended up having to pay for her appetizer, while the other one did not.The two of us who remained received lukewarm meals (which were fine, but nothing to write home about). Another server dropped off the meal for our friend who had left, and when we said she was gone, they just left it on the table, where it sat for the rest of the meal. No one came to check if we were enjoying our lunch. At one point, someone tried to deliver appetizers to our table, when it was obvious we were almost done our entrees. We had to flag our server down again to order coffee, then again to ask for our bill. There were zero apologies, just a quick comment at the end to the tune of \"sorry about the chaos.\" All in all, a pretty unpleasant experience. Don't think any of us will be back."}
{"text":"WOW! 

I went to Mildred's last night for dinner with a prix-fixe 4-course dinner Groupon. 

1st course: Broth soup with cheese and croutons. The soup is served with the cheese and croutons, dry, in a bowl. Then the waitress has a steaming pot of broth, which is poured over the croutons. Immediately, my taste buds started doing the happy dance. This was going to be a good dinner.

2nd course: The second course is by far the best part of the 4-course dinner. It's an amazingly delicious Gnocchi poutine. Gnocchi, real squeaky cheese curds, pulled pork and a mouth-watering sauce. Words can barely describe this ambrosial dish. 

The second course also came with tasty crab cakes. But, OH! That poutine!  I was told that it's part of their regular menu. So I might have to come back and satisfy a craving for this stuff now...

3rd course: Chicken breast served with potatoes and some kind of crunchy green leafy veggie (possibly rappini?). Anyways, it was very good as well.

4th course: The desert. Lindt chocolate ice cream in a bowl, drowned in espresso. YUM! My taste buds did another little happy dance right there.

By the end of it I had a nice little food baby going on. Time to go home and nap!

A note about the drinks: Beau's Beaver River IPA on tap is a 5 star craft beer. Their Cesar's are spicy and also very delicious.

Without a groupon deal, this place is pricey but definitely worth it.

P.S. It was very very busy on a Saturday night and even though we had reservations, we waited 30 mins to get seated; however, there was plenty of room at the bar and on the couches and the hostess was very apologetic and did try to explain the delay instead of leaving us hanging."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast which turned into brunch. The wait on Saturday, around 10ish was legit about an hour and 20 minutes. Was it worth it... maybe lol those blueberry pancakes were so fluffy and sooo delicious and I'm not a blueberry fan but I had he pancakes and the blueberry lemonade which was very refreshing. My friend also enjoyed her meal she had the smoked salmon Benny. She said it was the best she had, I'll take her word for it. The ambiance was modern and our waiter was friendly. I would come back but probably at a less busy time!"}
{"text":"Instragram pics will make your mouth water. However the food itself wasn't as good as it looked. Not worth the escessive waits on certain a days either."}
{"text":"I went with 3 other people today. We expected to wait an hour or more but we ended only waiting about 30 mins for a table on the patio. Which was not too bad.
--------------------
I had a bit of an expectation for Mildred's brunch because a lot of people had recommended it before. But I think the food is just average nothing in particularly \"wowing\". 
--------------------
My boyfriend was going to order The Manhandler but they were out of steak. It must've been a really popular dish considering they ran out of ingredients by 1. We were a bit disappointed, but opted for The Veda's Choice with a side order of  sausage. Which took them an hour later to tell us they had run out of sausages too. 
 --------------------
Another reason why we were disappointed was because it took very long for our dishes to arrive. Honeslty other restaurants I've been to before, if something went wrong normally either the waiter or manager would come and explain why the order is taking extra long to prepare. I guess this is something common at Mildred's because including us and about four other tables on the patio waited over an hour for the dishes to arrive. The server never came over to explain why and just gave everyone scones (2 pieces to be exact) and jam to munch on while we waited for our food. 
--------------------
My friend really wanted to try the blueberry buttermilk pancakes and she had high hopes. The server even told us these are fluffy sweet delicacies. Results : they tasted a lot like flatten muffins not to mention not even warm. For $16 these pancakes were just a tad disappointing. It wasn't fluffy at all. Maybe the batter was sitting to long before being cooked? 
--------------------
Two of us ordered the Veda's Choice which is basically croissant with poached eggs and bacon with hollandaise sauce. One of the croissant was kind of \"deflated\" u can tell it wasn't freshly made. So it look like someone squashed it with their hands. The taste was average. 
--------------------
In total we paid $95 for 4. Quite expensive for just brunch I would say. Im pretty sure I won't be returning to this joint. The interior and overall atmosphere is great, because the restaurant is rested in the inner street with plenty of open space for you to enjoy the sun out on the patio. But the food does not live up to my expectations at all."}
{"text":"I think I have found another brunch place I really like. We were shopping at the furniture store next door and decided to stop by for brunch after. The wait was about 20 minutes since we had no reservations but its a comfortable wait on a nice couch in a very open concept high ceilinged restaurant. We eventually got a great corner table and I love how bright and sunny this place is. 
I ordered salad with wild mushrooms, bacon and egg and it was delicious but my DH got the pancakes with the blueberry sauce and that was absolutely heavenly. Although it was a large portion it didnt feel heavy. 
I am definitely going back for the pancakes and the caeser which looked sinfully good."}
{"text":"Come here on the weekdays, weekends are a nightmare, especially with the baby and stroller.
Food is great, service is perfect.
Will always be back, on the weekdays!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I decided to go splurge for brunch Saturday morning, and is was worth it. My friend ordered Veda's Choice, I ordered Huevos Monty, and we shared a single pancake. They were all super tasty. My friend, who typically doesn't like pancakes, fell in love with the pancakes here. Definitely plan to come back sometime soon."}
{"text":"I first experienced Mildred's Temple a month or so ago, and have been back a few times since. This is a fantastic brunch area on Saturday and Sundays. Their biscuits are a must try! Also, serving very innovated Caesars, think chop sticks. The menu is fresh and fairly diverse offering a little bit of everything to the brunch crowd. But if you want to top off your experience you MUST ask for Pablo's section. Over the drinks, food and atmosphere, he alone made my experience absolutely extraordinary. He was charismatic, knowledgeable, and so passionate about the menu and our experience there, it was memorable. He made fantastic recommendations for each of our individual needs, and went above and beyond to make sure we were completely satisfied. I even hugged him before I left. Great place, impeccable service."}
{"text":"What a glorious summer lunch on the run. Had a salad with hot smoked salmon and soft-boiled runny quails eggs. Healthful decadence."}
{"text":"I was very impressed w this restaurant. It was a great night, with over the top service. The food was wonderful and full of flavour and they had a nice selection of dessert items and dessert wines or coffees. Inside had an open kitchen which is nice to see all the action. And it looks very clean and modern design for the layout. It's tucked away in the midst of liberty village but it's definitely a gem to check out."}
{"text":"I came in expecting super great things as I've heard it's a great place to eat. I was seriously underwhelmed with everything and probably won't return back unless it's a group thing or something. The MTK Burger wasn't very good (I tired part of my boyfriends burger... it was fairly bland) but the avocado chicken sandwich was decent, the chicken was the best part, so I left the bread. I'd rather go somewhere with better food, even if it's more of a wait to get in."}
{"text":"Gorgeous space, amazing service, and fresh flavours!

Arrived at Mildred's on a weekday for lunch a bit early (opens at 11:45am) and the friendly hostess took our jackets and allowed us to wait in the lounge area. 

The space is beautiful - high ceilings, good space between tables, open view of the kitchen, and large windows letting in lots of natural light. 

Our server, Maia, was friendly and attentive. Our table of 2 ordered the Huevos Monty ($14.50) and Chicken/Avocado club ($16). Food arrived quickly and the plates were quite impressive. Some may say the prices are a bit high (e.g., $5 for an orange juice) but we thought the quality of the dishes were excellent!

Will definitely return to try the scones at brunch."}
{"text":"Mildred's Temple Kitchen is everything I thought it would be, and somehow even better. I absolutely love really fancy brunch, and you won't be disappointed by coming here! The interior decor is so beautiful and the vibe is very posh. 

The lineup is a little bit crazy though. My friends and I got here around 10:30 and we didn't start eating until 12!!! 

Note: Make a reservation beforehand or else you will start eating your fingers!!! 

The wait wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, there were a lot of stores around and I've never really explored this part of the city before, so it was nice to just walk around. However, I will definitely make a reservation next time because I almost started eating my fingers. 

The best part of this brunch was the Scones & Biscuits. These were seriously so delicious, it was like every bite was this buttery goodness. It was warm in the middle and their apple butter jam was amazing! Damn, I could eat it all day. 

I ordered the The Lottie Salad \"It keeps me thin Mrs. Pierce,\" and it was alright. I thought the poached eggs on top were quite small, but somehow the scones and biscuits were so filling that I actually wasn't hungry after the brunch. 

The next time I come here, I'm definitely ordering the Mrs. Biederhof's Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes. And I will come back. 

There is a patio out in the front, and if it's a nice summer morning, I would definitely recommend snagging a spot there. 

TLDR; Posh, fancy, and filling, though make a reservation before coming or else you will face the dreaded consequence."}
{"text":"I work in liberty village and live pretty close so naturally mtk is one of my go-to's for nice brunch or lunch meetings with friends, co workers and clients. 
I love the decor of this place. It's really light, airy and modern. It doesn't feel pretentious, or snooty. it feels like modern canadian. which is perfect because that's what they serve. 
firstly, the caesars. omg the caesars. i don't like caesars but MTK caesars are delicious. perfectly spiced with amazing presentation. 
Burgers are awesome, sure they don't look monsterous and they look quite neat and lady like but it's all premium ingredients. For people complaining about price, I want to say, go to a fast food joint then. You're at a nice place where everything is locally sourced and is environmentally sound / sustainable- it's sad that it costs more to eat local and fresh but thats due to capitalism, industrial farming, and for other reasons I dont have to time to discuss right now. who came up with the logic that all burgers shall not cost more than 5 dollars? 
The curried cauliflower is awesome too. it has grapes in it and it works so well with a generous dollop of sour cream and perfectly cooked quinoa specks. 
Huevos monty is one of my favourite dishes here. Sure there are other places where you can get huevos but not like this. they've figured out a way to keep all the ingredients delicious and texture crispy and clean. who loves the first bite of a bean smothered huevos only to be turned off by how soggy, messy and unappetizing it looks after your guac, sour clean and runny mushy beans (oh yeah and your sunny side eggs) have all combined together- well mildreds huevos looks as pretty as it is delicious. beans are kept in between two toasted totilla topped with two perfectly fried sunny side up eggs topped with guac, salsa and sour cream. 

It's just good food and the service is always good. Servers are super nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Yuminess! Brunched here with my man and was fully satisfied all day! Generous portions and beautifully composed creative dishes. There's something so familiar and homestyle about their menu, yet, there's just  enough of a modern spin to keep my interest and intrigue. Of course, we had to have the pancakes which are thick and layered in gooey blueberry preserves while the plate is carefully laced in maple syrup. The addition of cream puts it over the top....
I had the croissant sandwich with eggs and bacon, super duper! My SO had steak on sourdough....also amazing, although, I didn't get a bite! 
Atmosphere is trendy - what the heck, they can run with that, their food is so f-ing amazing, they can do whatever they want decor-wise. This place has been around since 1989, they've done their time and it shows!"}
{"text":"A two hour wait for a table here on a Sunday, which was... insane. We arrived at 12 and were told it'd be a 1.5 hour wait. So we waited. And then 1.5 hours later, we still didn't have a table. And my baby was cranky as hell for hanging out in a stroller for so long. I know I know, they don't take reservations, so that's how the cookie crumbles, but at the 2 hour wait mark, I was about ready to flip a table. Silently. In my head. 

After waiting the two hours and still not having a table, we decided to camp out inside the restaurant. Baby needed a distraction from hunger, and I needed to sit. Half an hour later, we finally got a table and my girl was about ready to throw a fit. We had a nice seat right by a server station, so my little one got to wave at everyone walking by, but in the process her chair probably got kicked a bunch of times as well by accident.

The food is good - I won't complain here. The pancakes were delicious, and the scones were lovely (though that could be the hunger talking). We also had the heuvos and the benny, and they were both well portioned. We walked away very hungry, but very late for our next activity of the day.

Servers were friendly and took good care of us. Would I come back? Probably not - I don't think I can do the wait again :("}
{"text":"Was here last Sunday morning for breakfast with my girlfriend and her new fianc√©. i had been here once before years ago but i wasn't able to appreciate it like i can now. We got free parking right on the road in front. There would have been a twenty minute wait if we wanted a table but they gave us the option to sit above by the kitchen where you had a view of the whole restaurant which was actually pretty awesome. We started with mimosas which were done so well. Not too sour or strong. We got the butter biscuits to start instead of the black currant scones which was a good choice. They were so flaky and warm. i wish i had one right now. i got the pancakes for my main which surprisingly were not overly sweet. However it is very heavy and i couldn't finish. It was so fluffy and delicious and the whipped cream went so well with it. It probably just needed a bit more maple syrup. It was a bit of a wait for the main but not crazy long. i would definitely come back for the chicken and waffles. Very nice service. Come early because we got there just after 1030 and it was not bad but after us the lineup was crazy. And no reservations for weekend brunch. Plan ahead!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Came for b'lunch on a Thursday to get Manhandled.  Mmm... great steak on garlic sourdough with arugula and 2 sunny-side eggs on top. We also got there in time to try the biscuit and black currant scone.  Both were excellent, especially with the strawberry-rhubarb jam and salty cream.  Everyone at my table got the Thursday lunch special (the Manhandler) and we all enjoyed it - it's a lot of food. I didn't LOVE the pancakes as much as everyone else seems to.. they were incredibly fluffy but I've had the best (Clinton St Baking company in NYC) and this was not it.  We got a side of rosemary bacon.  I don't really like bacon but this was pretty good considering that.  With the lunch special we got pecan cookies to go."}
{"text":"All dishes has an Indian flavour. So if you don't like Indian food, don't go to this place. I've been there a few times, and it's a hit and missed with the food. 
Don't go there if you have 1 hour lunch break because you will need at least 2 1/2 hours for your lunch. It takes 30-45 minutes to get your 1st dish. So if you ordered an appetizer and an entree with 30-45 mins in between each dish, you will be there at least 2 hours, and there's another 15 minutes that you need to wait just to get your bill. (There was only 4 tables, 8 people in the entire restaurant. So not sure why it took 45 minutes to get our dishes. I took the salad with chicken. The chicken was good, but there was to much dressing on my salad...couldn't eat it. It was soggy and too sour. 
Dinner also took 45 minutes just to receive your 1st dish. At least, we were not on a time crunch, so it's fine. The food was better in my opinion. The fries and crab soup were delicious, the duck was well balanced with the blueberry and salad and the steak was juicy. We enjoyed the dinner more than the lunch. 
Compared with all the restaurants that's around the area, it's a little bit expensive in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure how to rate my experience at Mildred's. This place is really popular for its brunch on Yelp and IG. The presentation of their dishes are well done which is one of the main reason for their popularity in social media. 

I would rate my experience at 3 1/2*. 

We went for Sunday brunch. The restaurant is located at the Liberty Village. There's an underground parking available and I would tell you right now that it would be useless to park for less than 2 hours on the weekend. The main reason is that Mildred's does not take reservations on the weekend. Unless you come in right when it opens at 9am, be prepared to wait a minimum of 45 minutes, sometimes more. We came a little after 10am and waited for 45 minutes for a table for 3. They will ask you for your name and cell number, and they will text you when they are preparing the table for you and it will be ready in 10 minutes. The waiting sucked but there wasn't anything we can do unless go somewhere else. Also be advised that I had spotty cellular reception there. 

Once our table was ready, the dining area is nice with an open concept feel to it. Big windows bringing a lot of light. Too bad that you are looking out to the train tracks. However, the tables are fairly close as you will be able to hear the conversation from the other tables. Washrooms are unisex with individual stalls. Just make sure to lock it properly as the lock mechanism is a bit off. Also, it's a bit puzzling to hear boarding calls for Air Canada flights in the washroom. 

Now to the food, we ordered the Manhandler, Big Brunch Skillet and Veda's Choice with Bacon (click on the pictures to see what's on the dish). Besides the presentation, the food wasn't exceptional for the price they charge. Each of the different dishes had something we liked like the flat iron steak, the pulled pork or the poached egg and bacon. However, as a whole we were disappointed. I really didn't care much about the sourdough and eggs in the Manhandler and my wife was disappointed with the Spicy Piri Piri sauce. We did not order their Blueberry Pancakes as the the table besides us did and felt that it looked pretty but we weren't sure about the taste. 

Service was excellent and our server was really good. No complaints in that department. 

I think it's recommended to come once for the experience as long as you are aware of the wait and the food.

{"text":"Can I just say amaaaaazing pancakes? I mean, came here for b'lunch (which by the way I fell in Love with that word) and had a great experience. The drinks were so good, probably the best we had all trip long. Split a croissant egg sandwich with my friend but wish I hadnt because it was just soo soo good, I wish I had more. We even thought to order another one but once we saw the size of the pancake we had ordered decided against it. 

We were in Toronto for a short amount of time but I had bookmarked this restaurant weeks before our trip. Wish the location was easier to find because we got dropped off by uber and had to walk to different stores to figure out where it was. Had this restaurant been closer to our hotel in downtown, we would have come every single day. If I ever come back to this part of Toronto, this restaurant is a must & hands down would recommend it to everyone visiting."}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous to look at from the inside. Kitchen can be seen on a slightly elevated 2nd tier/level (but no quite floor). 

This place is everything you've heard and read about. We came at around 11am and were told that it was going to be an hour and a half wait. The wait time was pretty accurate luckily there is a lot to do around the corner including banking, kitchen stuff plus and grocery stores (so errand-y stuff).

The food was about what you expect from a brunch spot. It had it Benny like item, pancakes, heuvos, etc. We ordered the Veda's Choice and the featured special which was a Dutch pancake in a hot skillet, duck confit, some kinda of apple jam, two poached eggs and arugula salad around the bottom to round out the dish. 

I ate the Veda's choice, it was a croissant filled with two poached eggs, bacon (or smoked salmon if you want), bernaise sauce and an accompanying mixed green salad topped with pickled onion and shredded beet salad. The sandwich looks like it was a knife and fork job but it also looked solid enough to pick up by hand, so I did. It held up well the Benny is a weird sandwich to pick up I would not recommend it and my other dining companion did the knife and fork way and looked like she enjoyed it. I wouldn't write home to mom about this Benny but again like I said it's what you would expect from a hyped brunch space. 

The daily feature was okay. The presentation was great but the flavour became a little muddled together as you ate it. I thought it also ate a little sweet. Only the edges maintained their crispiness while the rest of the pancake ended up soggy due to the confit-ed duck. 

We added a plate of pancakes to finish off the meal as the portions didn't really fill most of the table. This is THE item to get. The pancakes are just perfectly made. It's light and crispy and not too sweet. GET THE PANCAKES!!

The service is speedy and very welcoming. I would definitely come back for the experience with the food being the accompaniment unless it's the pancakes."}
{"text":"Service was horrible and they gave my sister a salad with bacon twice. She doesnt eat pork! The service was super slow and  I dont know why they have tons of waiters . Very disappointed .Nice atmosphere but thats about it"}
{"text":"[Service]
I just want to tell everyone here to not go in the winter time. We waited close to 2 hours for a table of 2. There are a few stores around the restaurant but it's no Eaton Centre so you MAY get bored out of your mind. But when you do get to go inside, the service is superb. The washrooms are handicap friendly - this to me was amazing and deserves a big thumbs up. They have a ramp on the side so that individuals in wheelchairs can mobilize to the other end of the restaurant. Our waiter was very pleasant, didn't pressure us to order drinks, and gave us suggestions that were genuine (i.e. order a biscuit and not just a scone)

[Food]
This restaurant boasts about their pancakes; claiming it's the best in Toronto. I think as a foodie you travel around the world, eat everywhere you go, and sometimes (just sometimes) your taste buds are at a new high for standards of food. The pancakes in this restaurant were good but nothing near legendary. I will say that the portions can feed a family of 3 (lols) and the sauce they add at the top is super delicious but...it wasn't really THAT FLUFFY. I'm sorry to disappoint you folks but I've had way better. I'm not saying the pancakes are bad, it was definitely a good choice but to wait 1.5h...not for this. To describe the pancakes in detail, it is definitely soft but I would never use the word fluffy. The bottom is a bit crispy which is cool and the pancake as a whole is super thick.

Now I'm going to tell you about one dish that is worth waiting an hour for, but still not for 1.5+ hours lol. Veda's choice is a delight and damn that salmon is to die for! I just want to say that when you take a bite out of the croissant..mm mm, I love croissants by the way. This is surprising even to me but I enjoyed the salad, it was drenched in sauce but not so much that it was soggy.

Get the biscuit and skip the scone, that's all I have to say lols."}
{"text":"Food is good, but sadly not good enough to make up for the hour and 15 wait for a table. When we were finally called that the table was ready it was 15mins to their closing time and the restaurant was half empty. Why were we not called earlier? I would recommend coming during the week where they do take reservations."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Eggs benny was perfect. The sauce was wonderful. We had one order of pancakes for the table. Lovely, fluffy, not too sweet. Unfortunately the wait times can be long. Get there early on the weekends."}
{"text":"Pricey and okay. Had some event that was a little politically off-putting."}
{"text":"THE BEST PANCAKES you will have in your life!!! Well I shouldn't go that far but damn it was the best I've had for sure. It was SOOOOO GOOOD! Do not skip on that for anything. It had blueberries and whip cream and maple syrup mmmmm i wish i had ordered the full one instead of just a side pancake. Still for a side it was a fairly good size pancake. Had the special lunch which was a lamb pot pie and it was also AMAZING! Seriously the crust was so flaky and perfect and the broth was superb and the lamb tasted like roast to me but all of it was heavenly and incredible and i took the bowl to my mouth without any silverware to finish it off to the last drop!!!! They do such great things here i can't wait to make it back to get all the same stuff haha Just SOOO GOOD. Was so impressed and the service was excellent. The espresso they messed up on but still it was good. Quality everything here! Just DONT FORGET to GET THE PANCAKES! mmmmmm"}
{"text":"4.5/5 for sure and has always been a favourite place for brunch.  

Called in for lunch reservation and requested for table by the big windows (for photo reason of course haha) but when we got there, we were seated corner inside table by the stairs... wasn't too happy with that.  Hence the -0.5

Service was great, and really like the floor to ceiling windows.

Food was bomb. Ordered the wild blueberry pancakes of course, some fries, egg benny with the buttered croissant.

Pancakes are good to share, although I wished the orange juice was a bigger portion. The glass was very small.

Egg benny with smoked salmon was always a favourite and still is.

Overall great brunch - would come back again."}
{"text":"All of these recipes have been around for a long time so there's nothing groundbreaking or new or inventive here... But they sure as hell know how to execute on the basics. Very solid pancakes of course... Which they offer the full recipe on their website and I have made them for family and friends multiple times now. Definitely worth trip... But make sure to have a reservation!"}
{"text":"Food: 7/10 -- Value: 7/10 -- Service: 7/10 -- Ambiance/D√©cor: 10/10

The food is good, but it's not so good that warrants a two-hour wait during the brunch rush. We didn't have a reservation, so we left our names and they sent us a text after about an hour that they had a table for us. 

APPETIZER: Scone and Biscuit ($6)
---------------------------------------------------
$3 per scone or biscuit is too much in my opinion. The biscuit was buttery and delicious and the scone was alright. 

MAIN: Mrs. Biederhof's Legendary Light & Fluffy Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes ($16)
---------------------------------------------------
The pancakes are much thicker than your usual pancake. They tasted pretty good and it didn't come with much syrup, which, at first, made the dish feel like it was lacking the classic sweetness associated with pancakes. But it's a welcome change and feels balanced. 

MAIN: Big Brunch Skillet ($14.5)
---------------------------------------------------
I like spicy food, but don't have too much of a tolerance for it. I found this pulled pork skillet too spicy to eat comfortably or to really taste anything other than the spice.

The two dishes looked quite small, but were surprisingly filling. 

In general, the food was good, but not as good as a two-hour wait would suggest, and the restaurant was a really nice space."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon on a business trip. The wait was over an hr; however, the food was worth it. The blueberries pancakes are to die for!"}
{"text":"What can I say this place rocks!  VERY busy popular place for a reason.  Be prepared to wait at least 30 min. for a seat.  I've eaten here a few times now and loved the experiences.   Food is fantastic and the energy in the place is amazing.  Cons:  Long waits for a table and service was slow.  Waiter took a while to bring drinks and had to be called over a couple of times before he started to make regular check ins.  Overall the food was excellent.  Try the homemade hot sauce with your meal. You will love it."}
{"text":"I ate dinner at Mildred's last night. The service was terrible. We waited 40 min for our meal and not once did any staff come to our table during the wait. When the food finally came it was just  adequate. On our way out the hostess was too busy sitting at the bar speaking with the bartender to acknowledge us leaving. I will not return to Mildred's."}
{"text":"I would say 3.5.

I ventured down to Liberty Village for Mildred's Brunch at around 1 pm. The wait time was actually a big long for such a big space and patio at approximately one hour. Thank god i was in such great company, otherwise, it would have been excruciating in the heat.  The space inside is absolutely beautiful. Very open and spectacular decor, especially the lighting fixtures. 

Unfortunately they were out of what I wanted to order--the Lottie salad, so I suppose I should aim to come earlier  next time. The service was friendly,and the food came out pretty quick for such a busy restaurant. I ordered coffee, which was good. My friend's tea pot of Green Tea Kombucha only \"produced\" approximately 1.5 tea cups. It would have been nice if more hot water was put in the kettle and/or alternatively--if more hot water was offered. 

The crunchy granola was quite the filling and the mix of nuts and seeds and dried fruits was great; however,it would have tasted better if the yogurt wasn't as tangy. Vanilla yogurt would have been a nice alternative or the addition of honey/stevia. The scones were delicious. Very flakey and the butter and berry compote accouterments were just perfect. I highly recommend these.

I would give MTK another try."}
{"text":"God damn this place is good. 

I mean its good from a decor perspective 
I mean its good from a food perspective 
I mean its good from a service perspective 

Fuck - any perspective - it be good. 

The huevos at Mildred's make Lady M's seem like a trip to Bi-way. Don't get me wrong, Bi-way served a great purpose back in the day, but if you are looking for more complex flavours and amazing presentation - go to Mildred's. 

The day after Valentine's (the day after Mildred's had their happy endings in the bathroom event), I had the pleasure of accompanying Christine \"pork all the way home\" C and her lovely daughter Megan \"wise beyond her years\" C to Mildred's for brunch. 

We decided to do a total sampler and got the biscuits and scones to share. Man, these puppies are made with love. The love that is spelled L-A-R-D. They are glistening and buttery on the outside, and light and flaky (and buttery) on the inside. With Mildred's apple preserves, it was a complete \"ooohhh\" and \"aaahhhh\" around our table. 

Christine had the pancakes, while Megan and I each had the huevos. We decided again to sample it up and got 3 sides to share. The rosemary bacon, the fennel sausage and the roasted potatoes. The bacon was shitty. Flat out shitty. It was no Rowe bacon and it was not crispy. The sausage was full of \"ooohhh\" and \"aaahhhh\". The potatoes - meh - okay, nothing great. 

The huevos consisted of two extremely fresh tortillas that had delectable black beans inside. On top there was some guac that was smoother than Oprah's complexion after she gets her make-up done, 2 perfectly cooked eggs, creme fraiche and a home made salsa. All in all - it was awesome. 

I did get the chance to sample Christine's pancakes and they were airy, light and fluffy. Not too sweet - just perfect. 

I think Mildred's is great for brunch, and I can't wait to try their dinner whilst on a date or for a special occasion (mother's day comes to mind)."}
{"text":"Would give it 3.5 stars if I could. 

We went on a Sunday morning and had to wait 1.5 hours because they don't take reservations on the weekend. I liked the ambiance and our waiter was amazing, he even brought us free snacks on him to apologize for the wait time. The menu is VERY limited which was shocking to me as I thought a place this hyped should have more variety on their food menu. I did enjoy my food but it was nothing extraordinary?. My friend ordered their famous pancakes and I tried hers and found it to be okay. I would definitely not be back if that meant waiting more than 10 minutes because in my opinion, it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch in a beautiful space. We came early (9:30 am) on a Saturday to avoid the line. I had the special (ox tail gravy on biscuit topped with sunny side up eggs) and my wife had the pancakes -- both were great -- but the stars of the show were the potatoes and side order of bacon. The potatoes were a crisp perfection and the 'side' order of bacon for $5 may have been 10 (!!) slices of bacon. Too much bacon for two of us to eat and I LOVE bacon. Service was great and friendly but a little slow. Overall a great meal. $65 incl tip for two with coffee and that must do side order of bacon."}
{"text":"Undeniably a very good brunch spot. It's cute in here for brunch and mimosas with your girlfriends. There's always a line out the door on weekends, so expect to wait at least 30-60 mins before you're seated. 

Come here for the outrageously decadent pancakes. Don't expect a typical breakfast (or typical breakfast prices). The food is good, menu is interesting and the service is mehhhh. 

LV really needs a greasy spoon diner for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. 
The wait wasn't long. The restaurant was spacious and clean. Staff was really nice and most importantly the food was delicious. A bit hard to find the location on the first try but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Great space, decent food.

I came here for a work dinner last night, we had a set menu and a private area beside the kitchen. The place is beautiful, but there was nothing really outstanding about the food or service, in my opinion. I was expecting to be blown away by the food, particularly since our first course (garlic and tomato soup) was pretty amazing, but everything else was pretty average. Plus, there was another holiday party in the restaurant who were incredibly noisy and kind of annoying."}
{"text":"Great food, but this restaurant is terribly managed. Don't bother coming here for weekend brunch unless you have an hour+ to wait. Even with abundandant empty seating, you will be asked to wait due to the kitchen's inability to handle the volume. There are plenty of solid options nearby that will be happy to seat you."}
{"text":"Came for Winterlicious 2017 dinner. Now, some people had mentioned this place was more well-known for their brunches, and looking at how people are waiting and hour or two to get a seat cause they don't do reservations, I guess that's something to look into.

Upon entering the restaurant, you've got coat check on the right and reception on the left. It is a massive open space with a bar up front, seating area along the center and the left side, and a huge kitchen area on the right. Dishes are prepared and served up in front of you (well, kind of, if you choose to go and take a look). 

It is a pleasant environment. Lights are dimmed, flame candles on the tables, snowflakes hanging from the ceiling (presumably seasonal). There is a massive statue of a pig near the center, with a few racks of decorations beside it including a variety of bamboo steamers, fancy containers, and more pig statues. 

Washrooms were quite interesting. There's one door that reads \"Toilettes\", and the when you go in, it's just one big room with individual rooms on the left, a comfortable seating area with pillows in the back, and a sink on the right. Clean and well-maintained. There was also an accessible washroom at the back. Not sure what the couch-like seating was for though; maybe when you've had too much to drink and need to lie down? 

Our waitress was quite cheerful and took the time to recommend some wines for the night, as well as the dishes on the menu.

Most of the items do not appear to be on their regular menu besides the crab cakes, which is somewhat unfortunate because I would prefer to try items on the regular menu. But in any case I would assume the menu today reflects that of a typical dinner service. I ended up ordering the shrimp & crab cakes, a pan seared cod, and finished with an apple crumble.

Each dish took about 10 to 15 minutes to serve. Only one server was putting up dishes, so between our group of 5, they had to make two rounds to serve all the dishes. The servers were really busy though, with the kitchen staff calling for service every minute or two.

The shrimp & crab was something like a mash of all the ingredients into a cake, covered with batter and then deep-fried to a nice crisp. It was an interesting dish, and while I pondered whether it was real crab or not (compared to like...those sticks you get in chinese places), my teeth dug into a tiny, hard crunchy bit...which I can only hope was crab shell. Well, it was just that one piece and no one else seemed to have noticed any surprises, so maybe it just happened to fall in during prep.

The starter chedder and garlic biscuits arrived after we finished our apps. Well, there's one person making all these biscuits at the kitchen, and with all the biscuits going around hot and fresh one can only imagine it would take some time. It was pretty good biscuit though, and the homemade butter they served was also quite nice (as someone that doesn't usually enjoy supermarket butter)

The pan seared cod was well-done and had a nice firm texture. It was served in a succotash of beans, edamame, and pieces of bacon, along with a particular sauce that was very tasty.

Apple crumble was quite something as well. Crispy pie crust with very soft and chewy pieces of apple.

It was an enjoyable meal. It seems like the duck and waffles come come with an egg, but the waitress hadn't mentioned anything about it so the ones at our table ended up with no egg on their duck and waffles. Oh well..."}
{"text":"Can't rave enough about this place!  We came to have brunch here on the last day of Summerlicious, and it was exceptional.  Started with the watermelon salad and smoked salmon app... I was a bit nervous that the portions would be tiny considering the appetizers, but not in the least.  Our mains included the blueberry buttermilk pancakes and the cornbread, bacon and eggs.  Huge portions for Summerlicious, and very tasty.  We finished off with take home cookies.  Prices were reasonable, considering Summerlicious.  Loved the outdoor ambiance, and our server was very attentive.  We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Get here early as there is sure to be line. They only take reservations for bigger groups.
Our server was friendly, and the place has a relaxed feel it. The d√©cor of the restaurant was modern contemporary. Clean lines and it was warm in inviting. I liked the chalkboard on the wall.

I ordered the Blueberry Buttermilk pancakes. They were delicious and yummy! They texture of the pancake was soft and fluffy and not to sweet. I liked the addition of blueberries in the pancakes. It gave the pancake a nice fruity flavor. The portion is big, and I had to take some of it home because I couldn't finish it. They also serve it with maple syrup and whipped cream.

We also ordered the buttermilk scones/biscuits that were also delicious. The dough was flakey and buttery. They are awesome I recommend you try these out too!
My friend ordered the Veda's Choice - eggs benedict on a croissant. She ordered it with bacon and enjoyed here meal.

My only complaint was that I would have like the tea served hotter.

I'll be back here soon to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for brunch and dinner and have noticed a serious decline in the food. Came for Sunday brunch. Arrived at 1:30 and got seated an hour later. We waited over an hour for our food to come out which was no fault of the server/manager(?) who were extremely friendly and compensated us with juice and extra pancakes, BUT the food was just not the same. Pancakes weren't crispy, fluffy and moist as I had  remembered them. The texture was stale as if over cooked and almost chewy. Also, while we were waiting, I saw 4 or 5 plates of pancakes being sent back which showed that they just didn't make them right. The only reason I gave an extra star is because the service was excellent. I most likely won't be back for brunch."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd trip to Mildred's.  The first was eh and the 2nd I should have updated.  Now I'm at my 3rd, and here we go!

Last night we came and the host was nice enough to shove us in, even without a reservation.  That was awesome.  Our waitress was really attentive and nice.  

Now, the food.  We had the nachos to start and they were pretty simple and delicious.  The presentation was good.  My boyfriend had the steak and frites - that was also good.  I had the Bolly Cauli and that was the best thing!  The yogurt with the curry and the cauliflower and the quinoa and the YUM.  

But, as usual -- I'm always left a little cold leaving this place.  The Bolly Cauli was $18....for a bowl of cauliflower with spice, quinoa and greens and yogurt.  And I never complain about costly restaurants....but again, a little too much for what you get.  I feel like you can make the nachos and the cauli and the everything at home and see how expensive it really is.

The food will always be good, though."}
{"text":"I've heard rave reviews of this place for brunch and decided to go for dinner. The food was excellent however service was a bit slow even on a not very busy Friday night. The service is friendly but there seems to be some sort of miscommunication with the kitchen. I would go back however -1 for the slow service."}
{"text":"So on their menu it says the blueberry pancakes are worth the wait....well, they are right. This place makes the BEST blueberry pancakes. So fluffy, the blueberries + whipped cream = perfection. Doesn't get any better than this place. Also good is their Huevos Monty, which is their own take on huevos rancheros. It's delicious. I could eat those two things for breakfast everyday forever, it's that good. 

The place is very fancy, with beautiful decor. Be prepared to wait for an hour or even more during peak times."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch experience! I really recommend the specials... and the pancakes!!  

Food was to die for. Service was amazing. Food took quite a bit to come but the wait was absolutely worth it.

I don't give them 5 stars just because the bathrooms weren't very clean."}
{"text":"Food - 4 stars  Service - 2 stars

I would have happily given this place a 4-star review, except for the lacklustre service. 

We came here for dinner before heading to a concert at the Amphitheater. The place was surprisingly quiet on this night. Yet, I found the service to be slow. There were times where our drinks took awhile to come, and other times when we'd finished our drinks but couldn't order another one because our waiter was nowhere to be found. To be sure, the dinner took longer than we'd hoped, and we were a bit late for the concert.

Fortunately the food was really good. The french fries are to die for! I had the roasted chicken biryani and absolutely loved it. The others at the table were very happy with their dishes as well. The prices are pretty reasonable ($18 to $28 for the entrees). 

I think I'd come back here on a night where we had nowhere else to be later on."}
{"text":"This place definitely lives up to its name as the restaurant that serves the best blueberry buttermilk pancakes in Toronto! Although rather pricey, I think it'd be worth it to try if you're an avid breakfast food fan. The waiter service is impeccable and the pancakes are as fluffy and soft as the pictures tell. The blueberry syrup is not too sweet and it really soaks into the moist and porous pancake, making every bite enjoyable.

The Veda's Choice (egg benedict on a croissant) was also fairly good, but not special enough for me to rave about it, especially considering its price.

The one problem that I had with this restaurant was the ridiculous amount of time I had to wait to get my food. It took close to an hour before my two orders arrived.. For that reason, as well as its inconvenient location, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here forever and it was definitely worth the wait! There was a massive line when we got there at 11am which was kind of expected so call ahead and make a reservation LOL 
I got the huevos monty and a mimosa and the huevos monty was so delicious; the eggs were super buttery it was amazing.  Service was really friendly, I can't wait to come here again!"}
{"text":"This place is simply gorgeous. The decorating is so beautiful. The service was fantastic and the food was . Highly recommend the pancakes and the Vedas breakfast. Only thing is, we waited almost 2 hrs for a table on a Sunday. So maybe get there early! Worth it tho!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for brunch with a party of 8 and ended up waiting for close to two hours, luckily it was nice out so it was fine. But if I were to return I'd likely come back with perhaps a table for 2 or 3 for a shorter wait time. 

I ordered their weekend special which was a ham glazed with BBQ sauce over jalape√±o corn bread with eggs. It was so good! Make sure to ask for their hot sauce to add to your food. The hot sauce was great and I think home made, I assumed it would just be Tabasco sauce we were given and was surprised by how great it was. It added an amazing kick to the meal. 

Also had to order a side of the pancakes because of everyone's reviews. The pancakes were amazing, best I've had so far. The whipped cream with blueberry compote was such a great combination. 

If you're not getting the full order of pancakes, I would definitely recommend ordering a side of them, they're about $6 but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Mildred's Temple has been bookmarked on my Yelp list for a while and finally, I got a chance to check it out.  It's been a long time coming but well worth it!  I came here for belated Mother's Day and we came for brunch.  The restaurant is very comforting with a beautiful coffee bar and open kitchen.  We walked in knowing they do not take reservations, so we had to wait for approximately 45 minutes for a table but we walked around until they texted us letting us know our table was ready.  The hostess was really approachable and friendly, letting us know the status on our table as well as our server.  We were seated and our server came by to take our drinks.  We ordered their drink special, Blueberry Lemonade, a cappuccino and a regular coffee along with two of their scones.  The Blueberry Lemonade was tasty but expensive for the amount of lemonade you get.  The scones were served warm, with a homemade apple butter jam.  I'm not usually a fan of jams, but I thought I'd give this one a try and the combination of the scone and apple butter jam was delicious.  For our mains, we got Mrs. Biederhof's Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes (obviously) and Veda's Choice with Smoked Salmon.  Both were delicious and I kept going back and forth between the two dishes cause I couldn't get enough of either one!  Highly, highly recommend both!  The amount of food you get with each dish is surprisingly large even though it may not seem like it.  The only thing I wasn't too fond of was that our server was all over the place with serving us and his other tables.  He kept telling us he'd come back for us and he wasn't very attentive with our orders because we had to repeat the order twice to him.  But I wasn't there for the service, I was there for the food.  I was definitely stuffed after and I'm definitely coming back to visit again, even if I have to wait another hour for a seat because pancakes are my fav!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is super well reviewed and voted number one in a lot of blogs, but I really don't see what the fuss was about. The food is ok, but I have certainly had better in Toronto, not to mention the fact that you have to wait quite a while to get in here. I suppose the only advantage to this place is that it's large, so if you have a large group, you can get a table here. Otherwise, I'd recommend somewhere else. The Ace, the Westerly, ZeZe, etc, all those places have WAY better food."}
{"text":"Like everyone else, we came in to try the legendary buttermilk pancakes. After about a 45 minute wait, we were seated and the server was super attentive and kind. We ordered the poached eggs on a croissant with smoked salmon and of course, the pancakes. We also ordered some mimosas. Pancakes were quiet delicious but I think it is a little bit hyped up. The eggs on croissant was also great. The croissant was flaky and buttery. Overall, the food was very good but nothing spectacular. Is it the best brunch I have ever had? No, but the restaurant is super charming and the service is really nice! Definitely try it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Food for me is a 3, but definite bump up to 3.5 for the excellent service and the nice ambiance.

Been here now once for brunch and once for dinner (Winterlicious). 

For the Winterlicious dinner:

App - tried the fennel and endive salad, and the chicken liver pate. The salad was a mix of bitterness and blue cheese flavour. I wouldn't order this again. I also wasn't a fan of the pate. There was what seemed to be a layer of fat on top of the pate. 

Main - I had the duck and waffle. The duck was cooked well. The waffle was quite soft, I might have liked it to have a bit more shape/crunch on the outside. My fav part of this dish was the chutney. I also tried the beef cheek with the polenta parsnip pur√©e. It was good, but lacked in veggies. The portion size of the mains were quite large.

Dessert - the bread pudding is made with croissants! Mmm...Can't go wrong with a dessert made out of croissants. It was yummy. The 'famous' profiteroles were ok. Didn't stand out to me.

All in all, enjoyed the ambiance and service, but found the food to be quite average."}
{"text":"Fave brunch place especially the blueberry pancakes. Walk in only no reservations, always tells us we will need to wait an hour or two but this time only waited for twenty minutes and texted us when the table was ready. Place was kinda chilly, but they provided some people blankets if you asked. Pictured here was their daily special which was homemade ham, bread, sunny side eggs. Potatoes or salad were the side options but if you wanted both you could pay $1 extra."}
{"text":"Great pancakes, average everything else, so trust me when I tell you it is certainly not worth the wait AT ALL! 

The hostess's attitude needs a full 180 turn towards the positive side. Her job must be a tough one, but a smile and a welcoming greeting should be the basics, we were met with neither.  

The Food: If they tell you there's a wait, find the nearest diner and eat there you're not kissing out on much in terms of savoury. If you're dying for pancakes come back when they call you (having eaten already) and have them for dessert. 

The sad thing is its a great space, the food is good, but it's clearly one of the worst managed restaurants in town. The wait is because of mismanagement and slow food service. (50 mins to bring our food, and that's after our waitress suggested speeding things up by punching in the pancakes as dessert \"because they take 20mins to make\"!!) 
The table next us sat empty for a good 25mins till it got cleared and took another 10 for a group sit on it, which was clearly frustrating to watch knowing you had to wait TWO hours to be seated."}
{"text":"The. Best. Blueberry. Pancakes. 

I'm not big on pancakes, but this dish is actually something I crave. 

Some of the other things I had were good but were lack lustre compared to the pancakes. 
The Veda's choice was okay but not something I'd keep coming back for. 


The atmosphere is very relaxed and a nice place to meetup with people and have good conversation. The place is quite large so I didn't feel cramped for space at all. I also went around 3pm so it wasn't too busy. I love the exposed kitchen and the light coming in from the windows. The staff is very friendly and were very tentative.

My favourite brunch place thus far"}
{"text":"Delicioussssssss delicious delicious
You MUST get the blueberry pancakes! My suggestion is each member of the group you go with gets their own meal, and you guys get the pancakes to share!
Heads up- there's a LONG wait for weekend brunch and they don't take reservations... But I would say it's worth the wait.
The grilled cheese was so warm and golden- one of the best in the city!"}
{"text":"Not worth the 2 hour wait for some pancakes. 
TIP: if you drink freshly squeezed orange juice on a daily basis, you can tell the fresh orange juice at Mildred's Temple Kitchen IS NOT FRESH because it tastes like they mixed Tropicana with actual fresh orange juice so better off ordering some other drink :)"}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to eat brunch here for a while as I'd heard so many great things about the food and had seen so many instagram photos of the famous buttermilk pancakes! I went on a weekday to avoid the crazy wait times (an hour usually) that happen on the weekend and was seated on the patio in about 10 minutes. Before I get to the food I have to say the decor at Mildred's is gorgeous, and I found it very quirky and cool that they have patches of fake grass on the patio tables with a little garden gnome. I went with the intention of ordering the pancakes but when I got to the restaurant I wasn't in the mood for something sweet. My friend ordered the pancakes and I went with the \"flakey savoury tart\" which is a slice of spinach, goat's cheese, caramelized onion tart that comes with a mixed green salad. I'm not joking when I say that the tart was like a soft cloud-it was so fluffy, moist and amazing. The crust was perfectly flaky and crumbly. That tart goes on the list of one of the best things I've ever had! I tried the pancakes from my friend's dish and they are as good as everyone says, very buttery and soft, but I actually liked the tart better. 

All in all, amazing food that is worth the prices, great service and beautiful decor! Want to go again! :)"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with girl friends and expected it to be pretentious and trendy. I was pleasently surprised by the fresh look and friendly staff. Us girls sat there for about 3 hours chatting and sipping coffee and it was the perfect venue. 

The food was pretty good. I like that they have eggs benny on a croissant, something I like, but don't see everywhere. Fresh squeezed juice and endless coffee. 
Perfect Sunday aft."}
{"text":"Amazing Pan Cakes..

This is a Perfect Spot for a nice comfort brunch.. :)

Best Brunch in Toronto.. Hands down.

The biscuits are to die for.. :)"}
{"text":"I was surprised to see there was such a long wait time, but Liberty Village is getting quite popular. The food was great! It's not your typical breakfast/brunch joint with a heaping side of home fries. The food is refined, fresh and very well portioned. 

I had Veda's choice with smoked salmon. The croissant was beautifully buttery and flakey. The salmon was great, and with a pair of perfectly poached eggs. Delicious! And the side mixed greens salad cuts the richness of the dish. Overall, very balanced brunch. 

My friend had the pancakes, and they looked really good! Next time I think I want to try the huevos monty. Regardless, I'll come back. 

It's not too busy until about 11am. But you can easily put your name down, walk around liberty village and they will text you when your table is ready."}
{"text":"Delicious. One of the best breakfasts I've had in downtown  and wonderful atmosphere. There was a line to get a table. The Huevos Monty - so delicious."}
{"text":"Love love love!

I like to think of myself as a Toronto-brunch (wannabe) guru, and this is probably my #1 stop! We had their blueberry pancakes and the lottle salad (to balance out the caloric pancakes), and loved every bite!

The blueberry pancakes are loaded with syrup. If I were to go back. I would maybe ask them for syrup on the side of the pancakes."}
{"text":"Holy pancakes. One bite, and you realize why they were forced to move these from the brunch menu to the everyday lunch menu. They are, hands down, some of the best pancakes I've had. And while the centerpiece of the dish stands out, the toppings really kick things up a notch. The maple syrup is fantastic, as are the bluberries and cream. 

We also had the soup of the day, which was a squash ginger soup, and it was really good. I'm not usually a soup person, but soup like this goes a long way toward changing my mind. 

Had the crossiant to accompany the soup, and it was fine. I've definitely had better, and would probably recommend getting something else. Like the aforementioned pancakes."}
{"text":"Since discovering MTK after they moved to this location, I have enjoyed brunch and lunch many times.

The Good
Lovely space with huge floor to ceiling windows (with the occasional train)
Nice patio for the summer
Blueberry pancakes, fennel sausage, incredible scones, great soups and some very nice desserts

The Bad:
Can be a bit of a wait 
Can be a little pricey (but  did offer a $15 lunch combo of soup, sandwich & dessert)
Lots of parking in Liberty Village"}
{"text":"Extremely long wait, but I needed to try this place. After waiting for 2 hrs, we were sat down relatively close to the bathroom area. The table was small and the service was cramped, but finally our food came. The cocktails were alright though a tad on the pricey side. The pancakes were definitely great, however, were very rich and sweet.

Overall, the restaurant was a beautiful spot in Liberty however I'm not sure if it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"After years of Mildred being on my brunch list, I finally knocked this place out on Saturday. 

We arrived around 12:30 knowing there'd be a massive line and without failure that's exactly what we found. But, the nice part is that they'll take your number and text you when your table is ready. Our wait was only 45 minutes so we went to Starbucks for a coffee around the corner. 

After being seated, we started with tasty mimosas (mine with Grapefruit juice -- a nice little change up) and we both got the blueberry pancakes. These things are SO incredibly fluffy! I could only make it through one pancake before I though I might explode...but after the reviews and the brunch date occurring next to us, I also really want to try the huevos! Clearly, I must return!"}
{"text":"Food was good but our meal took 2hrs. They definitely need workers. I notice some people even walked out maybe it was a bad business day for them but they should disclose how long we will be waiting before we order not an hour after we have been waiting. You"}
{"text":"Yeahhhhh, so not the best first impression I've had. After all the good things I've heard about Mildred's Temple kitchen, my recent visit wasn't exactly what I had in mind.

First things first, I had a glass of water poured over me, and despite an apologetic server and an EMPTY DINING ROOM, she didn't even offer to move me somewhere not wet, I spent a good ten minutes drying myself off. The final offer? A free pitcher of water for the table. (Mildred's charges for water, btw) Not a stellar start.

Once my friends arrived, we decided to start off with drinks and appetizers before deciding if we wanted meals. Our food all came at different times. And I don't mean 5 minutes, I mean, two of us got stuff within 15-20 minutes and another came after being there for 40 minutes. We weren't warned that the gnocchi poutine would take so long, and it was especially interesting as the restaurant was very quiet. 

We complained to the server about this and she politely blew us off and disappeared in the back. I think she was embarrassed because of the water spill because she was very nervous around us and avoided our table during rounds. When we received our bill and waited to pay, we stuck around for 20 minutes for change. She didn't emerge and the other servers wouldn't come to our end. We ended up just leaving our nominal tip, not willing to spend any more time there.

The food was ok, but the service, abysmal. I've had much more serious issues at restaurants before which resulted in fantastic customer service afterwards but for something this bad out the gate to worse? A bit of a concern."}
{"text":"Very nice setting. I had their signature pancakes along with scrambled eggs and avacado. The service was excellent...very attentive."}
{"text":"Woah, so many reviews of this place. My sense is they're mostly from business and ladies' lunches, and family and hungover brunches. This place is very ok, which I think is why it works across all those categories. But it lacks pizzazz for the cost.

3 of 4 of us visited the loo towards the end of our visit and were perplexed to hear airplane safety and boarding announcement recordings in the stalls. As far as we could see, airport culture has nothing to do with the decor of the restaurant, which is quite lovely, but more country kitsch (pigs, garden pails, cookbooks), and whose best feature is the expansive view onto the GO tracks and the excitement of the trains swooshing by. But these are not airplanes, these are trains (for which announcements would also be available, were that the theme instead.) The only thing the bathroom announcements made us feel is anxious to get out of there and back to our seats (are we missing our flight? are we about to take off? didn't I promise myself never to fly Air Canada again?)

A lightbulb went on for me as I listened in the toilet: this restaurant was like an airport restaurant!! Its menu was in that no-standouts statistical middle zone that tries to offer an in-between meal for travelers without any big surprises. It was somewhat overpriced. Though it was busy when we arrived, it also felt weirdly anonymous and transitory. What's a Temple kitchen? Who's Mildred? Was she a former flight attendant?

If you couldn't already guess, we were enthusiastic to try a new place for lunch, but ended up feeling ho-hum about everything, from menu to \"check please.\"

I did half-sandwich swapsies with my pal, so we had the chicken avocado club ($16) and the grilled cheese ($14). The chicken had a bizarre and unpleasant texture, one of the thicker parts like rubber, as if undercooked, though it definitely looked cooked. Sourdough bread was good but holey, so this was sloppy with the spreads. It tasted alright, but the chicken turned us off. The grilled cheese was better, but one wonders how to make a grilled cheese worth $14. The salad fit the bill, but it's nothing extraordinary.

Our gents had trouble deciding what to order, too, and both settled on the \"Manhandler,\" basically steak and eggs, for $19. They both thought it was good, though neither was raving. The fries were deemed a bit soggy by all. Hot sauce and ketchup offered when the plates were delivered came in tiny side saucers (one on each).

Pints of easy-to-find Sidelaunch and Beau's are $8.50. Is this because we're in Liberty Village? Like I say, this is a safe and attractive place for local business people to take their clients, and I expect it is the easiest brunch spot for Liberty Village condo dwellers who are still tipsy and made up from the night before, and committed to making a fresh start of their lives with breakfast salad and scones."}
{"text":"Came here in the Summer and had the fluffy blueberry pancakes! So delicious and definitely one of the more memorable places.

It's good to make a reservation though! This place is super super busy in the Summer and we did have to wait about 30-40 minutes for a table. Despite the busyness, the service was friendly although would be nice if we were checked up on a little more often as we were sitting outside and waiting for water."}
{"text":"First of all, the environment and service is perfect for a weekend brunch. The space is very open and so you can freely chat with your company without feeling crowded. I especially love the high ceiling and natural lighting! 

The brunch menu is not large but with a variety of different types of breakfast food. You have to order their famous blueberry pancakes (with a side of bacon). The pancakes are already amazing on their own but every since we tried it with side of bacon, we have been addicted!! Other brunch selections that are also delicious are their eggs benny and huevos rancheros. The food is not only appealing but filled with various fresh ingredients. 

I decided to being my parents there because both the environment and food was inviting and family friendly. The only reason I gave a three star is I find myself eating the same food over and over because there weren't that many choices and my parents agreed. Also, we had a big group and made a reservation once but still ended up waiting for a while.

Overall a pleasant experience and would definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"Mildred's temple is a good spot for weekend brunch.  Located in the heart of Liberty Village.  You have to get here early on weekends because they don't take reservations for brunch hours.  Got here around 11 am and the wait time was approximately 1.5 hrs (was a little shorter than that but is about the average).  They do the standard in that they will take your number and text you when your table is ready.  Being in Liberty Village there is a decent amount to explore while you wait.  The inside is spacious and you don't feel crowded while dining.  The brunch feature is an ever changing item so it allows for a new experience each time.  A good favourite is the Veda's Choice with a mix of greens and beautiful croissant with poached eggs and with your choice of salmon and bacon (go with the salmon).  The pancakes are a must try (and can be a side order).  Very fluffy and filling.  Service was great.  Very friendly staff and wait time for food was about 15 mins.  Overall a good experience if you're around and worth the trip even if you're not."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch place in Toronto. 

The Blueberry pancake is a must!!"}
{"text":"A group of 4 of us arrived a little before 10am on a Saturday morning to see that there was already a line up outside. We waited in line for approx. 20 minutes only for the hostess to tell us to leave our name and number and wait another 30 or so minutes for them to call us. There was a lot of bench seating outside, so we waited there. We ended up being seated around 10:45 - so a total wait of 45-50 minutes. 

I ordered their famous blueberry buttermilk pancakes after hearing so much about them and I definitely think they are worth the hype. They were so fluffy and thick - better than any pancake you could make at home. The portion size is huge, so consider sharing them amongst the table! 

Our server was very friendly and made conversation with us, but the food took quite a while to arrive (yes... more waiting). They also took a long time to bring us our bills after we asked for them, so we had to wait an extra 10-15 minutes after our table was cleared before leaving. They definitely could've given us our bills faster in order to seat the next people in line! 

Overall, the food is delicious, but the wait times throughout the entire experience are kind of long. Their table turnover rate can definitely be improved with faster service inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Blueberry pancakes will leave you wanting more for days! Service is slow, and ineffective. Long wait for weekend brunch. They don't take brunch reservations and never pick up the phone."}

The staff are super professional, and make super helpful recommendations, the decor is very appealing, the open concept kitchen is really cool, and the food is consistently great! 
I have had Huevos Monty, Little Kay's Grilled Cheese Sandwich, and Veda's Choice, and they were all fantastic, but I always always always make sure to get a side of the blueberry pancakes. They are so light, so fluffy, and so blueberry!!! 
I will definitely be back to Mildred's for more :)"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast and I'd say I really like the environment and how the restaurant looks. The staff are really nice and try their best to attend to my needs whenever they came by to check up on me. Its definitely a great place to have some coffee in the morning or catching up with a friend for brunch!"}
{"text":"Almost a 5. Great decor and ambiance paired with a great selection of brunch items and innovative twists on breakfast staples.
The pancakes may even make it on the letter home. Fluffy stack of hot cakes with a decadent berry coulis and whipped cream.
The grilled cheese is heaven and if you pair them with the Rosemary potatoes you have a winning combo.
Servers are super accommodating and friendly.
Been back a few times now and not just because it's close to our home .... Highly Recommended!"}

Brunch: amazing pancakes and salmon benedict.  Interesting rosemary bacon. The best Caesar I've had in the city. Service was spot on. 
Dinner: mediocre beef dish, excellent mashed potato and fantastic seasonal veg wrapped in a bundle. Service was essentially non existent. And the restaurant wasn't that busy.  
Ambiance is very work appropriate. The gym above the restaurant made it sound like the city was under seige. Avoid for romance, unless ur into that. No judging here!
Bathrooms are literally the most perfect out of all the bathroom game in... well anywhere. It's all about the privacy! Be still my heart."}
{"text":"Omg the best pancakes ever!! I always said nothing would ever be good as my mom's pancakes until visiting Mildred's. We went during a weekday brunch to avoid long waits. Would definitely go again and wait for two hours (even if I have too) for those delish pancakes!!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot especially for brunch on the weekend! (Although there is always a line and you'll probably have to wait a while to get in but it's worth it). You can just give your number to the staff at the door and they will call or text you when your table is ready. It's right in the middle of liberty village so it's a nice area to go for a walk to pass the time!

Inside the restaurant is pretty unique. It's a mix between a modern and industrial design, with the large windows and high ceilings making it feel really bright and spacious, yet cozy. I also like how their kitchen is not holed up somewhere in the back, but basically on the restaurant floor. It's kind of cool to see how busy and chaotic, yet organized the chefs are. The service is friendly and attentive, and the staff are always ready to help.

The food itself is really good - the pancakes are worth all the hype! They're thick, warm, and fluffy and are made even better by the blueberries and whipped cream - some of the best pancakes I've had! I would also recommend getting the smoked salmon eggs benny on a croissant or the brunch skillet - both so good!

It may be a tiny bit more expensive than some other brunch spots, but then again is a little higher end of a place. All said, from the food to atmosphere to the service, its worth it!"}
{"text":"Service very friendly, but food took forever to come out.
Went for brunch.  here's my summary:
Pancakes are amazing.
Big Brunch Skillet was very good, Piri piri salsa is delicious.
Veda's choice is their version of eggs benedict but served on a croissant.  I thought it was so so mainly because the croissant was way too flaky/dry.  I prefer a chewier, buttery croissant.  Other than that the hollandaise was perfect, eggs perfect, bacon was good but skimpy.
rosemary potatoes were great.
Also recommend you order bottled water here as the tap water stinks like sewer a bit."}
{"text":"Prepare for 1hour+ wait time on the weekend!

Neat environment, with open concept kitchen. I really enjoyed their pancakes topped with blueberries and whip cream; it was nice and fluffy with the right amount of moisture. However, I was a bit surprised by the cost of their slightly bigger than shot-glass sized orange juice costing $5!"}
{"text":"I went d2or the 1st time for my birthday brunch. A bit of a wait...but it was worth it. Our server Pabb along with the excellent food and ambience made for an enjoyable meal. Sunday brunch doesn't allow for reservations so get there early!"}
{"text":"A typical pretentious, big city breakfast place with lots of breakfast \"creations\" but not anything traditional on the menu.  If you are looking for simple eggs, omelettes or scrambles, this is not the place.  Perfect for the avocado toast crowd-but be prepared to spend $15 for the plate.  
Food was good, but certainly not worth the price.   Also very loud, not good for conversation at all.  The noise of dishes and plates reminded me of a noisy cafeteria.  I would not return.  Several places in the area offering much better atmosphere and value.  Fine dining sort of decor,!which must be why breakfast for two was $50.  Yikes!"}
{"text":"This is a spectacular venue with an awesome staff who truly care about every detail. It was my first time Officiating a wedding ceremony here and I was so impressed with the set up, execution and professionalism with which it was handled. Looking forward to my next opportunity to work with the MTK team."}
{"text":"Super friendly service, and well rounded menus. But best menu is a brunch. Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes are THE best! Wait times are crazy after 11:00 AM, so go at 9:00 AM ;)"}
{"text":"In keeping with my obsession with brunch, we visited Mildred's Temple Kitchen over the Easter long weekend with our 14 month old son in tow. 

As someone who considers them self fairly with it and with an identity outside of being a mother, I am still appalled as the attitude projected in some downtown restaurants at small children. It's deplorable. Because, really, Hipsters, who do you think will be replacing your ass at the diner stool when you die? But I digress.

There was a little wait for a table (about 25 minutes) but once we were seated, we were welcomed wholeheartedly. Many of the staff came by our table just to say hi to our kid (who is pretty effing cute) and the wait for a table was quickly forgotten once the most delicious house-made scones and preserves arrived. 

I had their special version of eggs Benedict, which was served on a croissant with the most fantastic hollandaise sauce I've had in a long time. 

The decor is fantastic, the service impeccable and the food deeeelicious. You can't really go wrong. And don't judge a book by its cover. Mildred's Temple Kitchen may be decorated like some kind of gallery space, but I'm certain that if you find yourself there with a little one, you'll be just as warmly welcomed as you would without. 

Amazing."}
{"text":"Mildred's Temple Kitchen is situated in liberty village, so despite the 45 minute wait for brunch on a Saturday morning, it wasn't all too bad because you can walk around in the nearby stores. The restaurant was quite big, and the lights and big windows made the interior really cute. The three of us got a corner seat with pillows, which made the experience extra cozy!

Unlike what you'd expect from the name \"Legendary Light & Fluffy Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes,\" the pancakes were neither light nor fluffy. I was pretty surprised because they were actually more dense (like scones). Nonetheless, they still tasted amazing and paired really well with the blueberry compote! The best part may have been the maple syrup. Since the compote wasn't too sweet (surprisingly!), the syrup adds just the right amount of sweetness to the combination. I can't comment on the whipped cream- I opted out of that because I personally don't like whipped cream. I would definitely come back for the pancakes!

I also ordered their weekend special, which consisted of two sunny side up eggs overtop maple glazed ham with BBQ sauce and jalape√±o corn bread. It came with a side of mixed greens as well. I would say the eggs and ham were quite average, seeing as the BBQ sauce was quite overpowering. The corn bread was tasty- the jalape√±o definitely added a nice (spicy) kick to it!

Lastly, I need to make a comment about my unique washroom experience at Mildred's. There are individual stalls, and it's as though you are on an Air Canada flight because they play the audio recording of announcements and safety procedures. Not too sure why they do this, but it was very interesting.

I can't wait to come back to try Veda's Choice with smoked salmon (and the pancakes again)!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place out for awhile now and I'm happy I finally did. Went here with some friends. 

General consensus from the group is that the pancakes are AMAZING! They're fluffy but different than what you would normally describe a fluffy pancake to be (kind of like the consistency of biscuits but lighter?) I am definitely a fan. Ordered the Huevos monty, Vedas choice AND the pancakes. Everything we ordered has a different take to their normal counterpart. Can't say I'm disappointed in any of them but when i come back I'm definitely coming back for the pancakes. 

The atmosphere was great too! Very good brunch spot that makes picture worthy dishes to enjoy with friends. The only thing that I wish we could have done was make reservations (I don't know if because it's the holidays, it's first come first serve, or if it's always that way for brunch?) the wait wasn't too bad. The suggested wait time for a table of 2 was 25min and a table for 4 was 45 min, but it was definitely a shorter wait AND they text you so you can walk around instead of just standing in there waiting. We ended up asking for two tables of 2 but they were able to seat us together in the end, which was great service in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place...I dream of its food. It's so far from where I live and inconveniently not close to the subway, but I still love it. Last time I came with my boyfriend, we blew $70 on brunch (oops) but we were stuffed until we couldn't walk without waddling. Here are the things we got: 

1) Iced Lattes: Refreshing and delicious coffee, the perfect accompaniment to breakfast. 

2) The scones: In hindsight, 3 scones for 2 people was too much. But this was the start of brunch and we were starving. They come with butter and jam and are light and flaky. 

3) Blueberry Buttermilk pancakes: we had to order these to share. They are a must-have if you come to Mildred's and are absolutely the best pancakes ever. They're extremely fluffy on the inside but the top and edges are slightly crispy. They are thick, delicious, and riddled with blueberries. You have the option to order them one by one ($6 for one I believe) or just get the 3 for $16. 

4) Veda's choice: my own \"entree\". Words can't describe how good it tastes when the smoked salmon mingles with the Bernaise sauce, nestled between a piece of buttery croissant. Great, I'm drooling. 

5) The Manhandler: this was my boyfriend's choice. I had a couple bites and it was steak and eggs elevated. He even finished the accompanying arugula with gusto, and he's not a fan of salads. 

The interior is spacious with a modern mixed with antique feel. This might be a weird suggestion, but check out the bathrooms. It's really nicely decorated and they play airport announcements overhead, making it seem like you're travelling to an exotic country. I may or may not have taken a 5 minute food coma nap in the sofa area inside.

(11/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot better food ... the side salad wasn't fresh at all, and the croissant-salmon-egg was pretty normal. The egg inside also wasn't cooked well. I and my friend waited almost 1 hour and half for a table and it just worth to see the design inside. I only give stars for its interior design and nice servant. 
Will definitely not waste my time again for this place!"}
{"text":"Apparently brunch is the big big thing to do in Toronto. My sister and I kept going back and forth where we wanted to go. Many other places on our list were just typical brunch menus so we decided to check out Mildred's which seemed to have some interesting options.

We sat outside in their patio area. Host was super nice and so was our server if maybe a little timid. We ordered a scone and a biscuit. Both were worth trying. I ordered the Veda- croissant with poached eggs, bacon, bechemel sauce, and a side salad. Super rich and frankly delicious. My sister got the Huevos Monty- crisped flour tortillas layered with black beans, over easy eggs, sour cream, and guacamole. She was only going to eat half but it was so good she ate all of it. Their coffee is realz good too.

The inside decor is super cool so if you can't sit outside you'll be super fine inside. Anywho it was a great way to spend the morning."}
{"text":"The Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes are to die for at Mildred's Temple Kitchen.  Light and fluffy, and not too sweet, and the best part is, you get 3 giant portions of them.  I always find that I prefer savoury tastes for breakfast rather than sweet.  So, if you're the same, try the Huevos Monty.  This dish reminded me of a popular breakfast dish they have in Costa Rica, called gallo pinto (translation: beans and rice). It offers the same type of salted black beans, and is a twist on the typical western breakfast food.  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for brunch with my boyfriend while we were vacationing in Toronto. When we arrived, it was extremely full and the hostess told us that we would have to wait about 15 minutes, so we sat at the bar. Only a few minutes later, she sat us (yay!). We sat for a good 15 minutes until the server remembered about us. We could tell because we made eye contact with her right as she had an \"oh sh**\" look on her face. The food didn't take too long to come out. I got the Veda's choice with bacon and he ordered the blueberry pancakes. We really enjoyed the food, except the server did not check up on us to refill our water or ask us if we liked the food.

Overall, I would recommend trying Mildred's at least once. The prices weren't too bad and the food was wonderful. If the service wasn't so terrible, I would've given five stars."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch.

For a city like Toronto, so replete with brunch options, it's always a bit disappointing how packed they all are every weekend. And while I can get myself into a place where I like the coziness, most of them remain crowded even once you're seated.

Not Mildred's. Popular, yes, and deservedly so, but they have an excellently large space, an open kitchen, and a nice light feel. Friendly service, good portion sizes and, on our most recent visit, live bluegrass music.

As for the food, pretty great. The huevos monty is a personal favourite with sunny side up eggs, avocado, black beans and salsa on tortillas. If breakfast is your starch meal, their blueberry pancakes (with Blueberries, not blue-coloured berry smudges) are thick and flavourful. Good coffee, fresh juice, all the brunch staples and while the menu is a little more classy than your typical greasy spoon, they have a good list of greasy side orders: the bacon is tasty, but winners choose the fennel sausages.

As a dinner spot, this would get fewer stars - at that point they compete against a stronger field, and their uniquenesses as a brunch spot are less remarkable in a dinner joint. Go for brunch, and stop making that face where you think only *other* people brunch. It's a perfectly cromulent meal.

PS - Last meal we had with friends before our daughter was born, and now, 6 months later, the last meal those same friends had with us before their son was born. I guess what I'm saying is: Mildred's causes childbirth."}
{"text":"Double date +baby approved!

I love the open concept where there's natural sunlight that fills the restaurant up with energy while the decor is modern and chick.

Although they could definitely maximize their floor plan a lot better to fit in more tables and increase their turnover rate.

They were very accommodating when it came to getting a high chair for the baby, takeout boxes for our leftovers and scones.

Service was excellent. server was super knowledgeable about the menu, energetic and friendly. She always came to check up on us.

The infamous blueberry Pancakes were on point but portions could be a bit more for the velda's choice to increase their menu value.

BEWARE*** wait is long so arrive early to avoid disappointment. Usually about 1-1.5 hour wait during brunch peak hours (12-2) and hate that they don't take reservations for groups less than 6ppl"}
{"text":"Working in Liberty Village, Mildred's is a frequent lunch and dinner spot (the $15 lunch quickie includes a main and dessert, changes everyday, and is always delicious!). 

But, there brunch is so good it has me travelling back on the weekend. 

After trying a few delicious menu items, I've settled on the Huevos Monty as my regular dish. Tortillas with beans and cheese, topped with two sunnyside up eggs, salsa, sour cream and guacamole. 

As a fan of spicy food, I always ask for hot sauce and have been given tabaso here. And I've frequently lamented to my dining partner about how a homemade hot sauce would be what pushes this restaurant over the top for me into 5 star territory.

This weekend, I asked for hot sauce and got the most delicious homemade hot sauce ever. Super spicy, with scotch bonnet peppers and delicious spices, this made my favourite dish even better. 

For those complaining about the price, I'd like to know where you usually find these bargain basement brunches? Most of the mains in the average TO brunch places are $10-12  - and they're not even close to the calibre of MTK's fare. I'd happily pay an extra $2 for their dishes over Easy Rider. 

For organic, homemade, locally sourced ingredients, served in a beautiful setting by professional servers - it's a great deal."}
{"text":"This was a really cute restaurant that my friend and I visited on an early Saturday morning. There was no wait at around 9:30AM, but the place was already getting quite busy. By the time we left the restaurant at 11, there was a long line of people waiting at the door for a table, so do try and go early if you can! They unfortunately do not take reservations :(

As for the food, I ordered the Big Brunch Skillet that some people have said is a small portion size, but however left me feeling very full for the rest of the day. The pulled pork, bean and egg was a very good combination. However, in the menu, it said it includes potato hash, but really it is just a couple chucks of potato, not that hashbrown that I was more so expecting. Overall, it was a very unique brunch item that I have not seen anywhere else, and enjoyed very much, but was not 100% blown away by the quality of the food.

I was getting dessert from another place after so I did not get to try their famous blueberry pancakes, but if I get the opportunity next time, I definitely would!

Mildred's Temple Kitchen is a great place to talk, socialize and enjoy your morning. I would definitely recommend for the atmosphere, but the food has room for improvement.

Taste: 3.5/5
Value: 4:5
Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"The wait times for brunch are slightly ridiculous, but for good reason. This is by far my favourite brunch spot!

Mrs. Biederhof's Legendary Light & Fluffy Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes are a must. 
Another favourite of mine is the Veda's Choice. I'm a big fan of Eggs Benedict and the Veda's Choice puts a nice spin on the breakfast classic.The croissant is so buttery and flakey, the Bernaise adds a nice tang to the dish and the rosemary bacon compliments everything perfectly.
I always plan to order something different whenever I am able to go to Mildred's but I never fail to order the same thing. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant is clean and welcoming and is perfect for big groups. I always find that the wait staff is friendly and attentive. They're never too pushy but are informative about the menu."}
{"text":"What a great spot for brunch.  We arrived around 2:15 on a Saturday and had a 15 minute wait.  The location of our table was ideal for watching all the meal prep to help us get an idea of what to order. Service was promt and friendly.  We ordered the eggs monty, bbq pork skillet and split the pancakes.  Everything was fantastic and a perfect amount for two hungry people.  
Go,  you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"When I ask my friends for brunch they automatically say Mildred's. I finally caved and came here on a Wednesday afternoon to check out what's so good about this place. 

There was no lineups when I arrived and I was seated right away which was great because I was in a slight rush. Our server was very sweet but unfortunately I didn't catch her name! 

The menu was very simple with classic brunch items, I got the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and my friend got the steak. I'm honestly too lazy to go on their website and look for the actual name of these dishes.... but lastly we decided to share what Mildred's is known for, the pancakes. 

The egg benny was delicious, I enjoyed the fact that it came with a salad so I felt super healthy too. My friend said he also really enjoyed his steak! I saved the pancakes for last and in my opinion I was very disappointed with it. It was really dense and cake like, I was expecting to be a nice fluffy pancake. That really threw me off and it just wasn't for me. 

Overall the service was great and food was good too. Would come back but I wouldn't get the pancakes again"}
{"text":"A great place for brunch on the weekend if you're feeling a bit more fancy. The decor is very pretty and makes you feel like you're in a high end restaurant, but with affordable pricing! I tried the famous blueberry pancakes, and unfortunately I think I got a bad batch because the pancakes were too doughy and dry. The taste was really good, however the fluffiness was just not there. My brother got the salad and it was refreshing and filling. We also had an order of the side potatos and they were seasoned and baked well."}
{"text":"Be aware that Mildred's only takes reservations for \"b'lunch\" Monday to Friday and no brunch reservations on the weekend!

We reserved a table for 3 on a Friday and we were lucky to avoid the wait at prime brunch time! Our server, Carlos, was super friendly, informative and attentive! 

FYI... They serve mimosas with any type of juice that you want - pineapple, grapefruit, apple, orange juice - mm, perfect brunch cocktail!

For brunch, I chose Veda's Choice with smoked salmon which was just delicious. It was topped with the perfect amount of Bernadise sauce and wasn't too overwhelming/heavy. It usually comes with a side salad but I opted for half salad, half house made French fries for an extra $1... Delicious!!! I was happy to be in the company of two others which allowed me to have a bite of their entrees. I tried the grilled cheese which has some kind of apple relish inside and it was one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've ever had. I was also lucky to have a bite of the b'lunch skillet and all the ingredients were perfectly paired together: potatoes, beans, pulled pork, sunny side up egg with the right amount of spicy! 

Don't forget to get an order of the famous pancakes... I'm not usually a fan of dessert as it's usually too heavy and way too sweet but THESE PANCAKES THOUGH!!! So so so fluffy with whipped cream and blueberries which were just delicious. Comes in a stack of 3 for $16 or you can order 1 for $6! 

Even though the bill was ~$100 for our brunch, it was well worth it :)"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, mainly because the blueberry pancakes are the most fluffiest and yummiest ones. Another recommendation would be the ox tail poutine, to die for- however it is only available on the weekdays. I would recommend coming on the weekday as you can book on open table. Weekends are minimum 40 minute wait time unless you go after 2:00."}
{"text":"I'm glad I finally decided to try this place out despite the awful wait times you have to go through. I came at around noon on a Saturday, and although I was told I'd have to wait an hour, I was seated after only 20 minutes. Woohoo!

I absolutely love the atmosphere here, especially during weekend brunch hours. This restaurant is designed beautifully and is very refreshing and clean. It's nice to see such a full house mixed with all kinds of people, as it's always so busy (yet still feels spacious). The service was wonderful and conversational, and the food was simply delicious! No complains there. I really enjoyed the skillet and the Veda's choice dish - you can't go wrong with these orders. I also had the famous fluffy blueberry pancakes as well, just to see what all of the fuss was about. These were definitely tasty, but overhyped. I thought they were just okay, and I probably wouldn't order them again. I'm not the biggest pancake person so it was more of a one-timer kind of thing for me. 

Mildred's was great overall, and I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"can you build a resto around 1 kitchy dish... i guess you can... dont get me wrong, the green eggs and ham are good but everything else is kinda meh... but i guess if you need to grab brunch in a more trendy venue in liberty village then this is it..."}
{"text":"Long waits, slow service, good food. Glad I tried it, but I wouldn't again wait 1.5 hours for brunch."}
{"text":"Had brunch here the other weekend. The wife had eggs Benedict and I had some crepe black bean thing. Both were very good. The eggs Benedict had an interesting mustardy flavour that I wasn't expecting, but enjoyed. 

The patio is super nice, but in typical Liberty Village fashion the area is pretty dead outside the confines of the restaurant. 

This place is definitely worth a visit. I'm not too sure what the deal is with the bathrooms though. A while back they were encouraging people to have sex as some valentines day stunt. Plus, when I went to use them they were playing airline boarding calls over the speakers. Very weird, but as long as they don't start serving food in there, its all good."}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESSSSSSSSS. THE BLUEBERRY PANCAKES ARE THE BOMB . 

Located in Liberty Village, I've always wanted to come to Mildred's Temple Kitchen. Super easy to find, we made reservations for 12pm on a Tuesday and were surprised that they filled up that quickly on a regular weekday. The ambiance was, well, filled with love as we went just right after Valentines Day and they still got a ton of hearts hanging from the ceiling. The lighting was perfect and natural for pictures! 

Knowing it was a great spot for brunch, we got Veda's Choice which was the poached eggs (3) stuffed inside a crossaint, with lettuce and your choice of either smoked salmon or the rosemary bacon. We decided to go for the bacon! This was a little messy to cut with, but the eggs werr poached to perfection and gently oozed out onto the crossaint as you cut into it. In addition this meal came with mixed greens for $14.95.

Now for Ms.Biederhof's pancakes! I thought these were the best pancakes I ever had! It was a much thicker pancake than usual, meaning the batter was thicker and I could taste or think they used condensed milk to make it taste THAT great. The whipped cream and blueberries were placed on the side and I loved how they served it that way because I personally hate whipped cream on anything (sorry Starbucks). This dish was $16 for three thick pancakes. Definitely a recommended dish from myself."}
{"text":"I have been here for brunch a few times now. I think this place is a nice ambience and the seating is pretty comfortable. But, I think their menu is too small for brunch and the price I would say a little bit on the pricey side compared to a lot of other brunch places along King West. Overall the service was great the food was satisfactory. However if you do plan on coming your for brunch be prepared to wait because there's always a line."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic for brunch. Atmosphere is good - very open, busy and the acoustics make it a little hard to hear, but the food is totally worth it. We showed up on a Sunday late morning and despite being told it would be an hour wait, something opened up in 20 minutes so they were very accommodating and just great. Quick, good service. Attentive wait staff. Bathrooms were a trip - they have an airport announcements loop. Loved it. Definitely have a meal here!!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend right at 11am when it opened.  It got busy quickly. I ordered the Veda (2 poached eggs on a croissant with your choice of smoked salmon, rosemary bacon or spinach.)  Here's a great tip:   get half salmon and half bacon!  Best combination ever!  And I loved the fact that they were able to do this for me.  You also get your choice of either salad or fries.  I had the salad which was a great mix of greens.    
Our waiter, Pablo is wonderful.  So another tip - ask for him!!  He makes all the dishes sound amazing and provided us a great service - refilling our coffees before it even got cold.  
Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I have ever visited Mildred's Temple Kitchen. I have heard many great things and have seen endless photos on Instagram. My friend and I were served by the wonderful Pablo. Pablo was extremely welcoming and catered to our every need. We decided to share the blueberry buttermilk pancakes and the Veda's choice with smoked salmon. All I can say is WOW WOW WOW!!! Everything tasted absolutely magnificent. The perfect balance between the sweet and savoury dishes was sublime. I am definitely going to make Mildred's Temple Kitchen my regular brunch spot. I can only hope to be served by Pablo again to make the experience even more spectacular."}
{"text":"I made a trip all the way to Mildred's Temple on my birthday just for the pancakes. Honestly, the moment I walked in the place, and saw how nicely decorated it is (very modern, whites, greens, booths and chairs), I knew that the food must be good.

I like how brightly lit the place is, tall windows and very chic, urban decor. There was upbeat music playing in the background, an open kitchen, which is really neat and snowflakes hanging from the ceiling! The washrooms are impressive as well. Clean with the same colour scheme, there are individual washrooms, not one big room with stalls.

The staff is above and beyond friendly and helpful. We came here around 2:30pm, and we know the kitchen closes at 3 so we tried to hurry up, but they absolutely did not mind. They were so excited to tell you about the menu, make recommendations, and asked you what you wanted to drink or if you need anything. You don't even need to raise your hand for service, you can just look up, and someone will look right at you, happy to serve you.

My friend an I both ordered the pancakes, and there were a LOT of pancakes. It was soo worth it. I think i was eating pancakes wrong my whole life. These pancakes was a cake that was pan fried. Not like the regular dense flat, non-airy pancakes we're used to. It was so fluffy and just the right amount of sweetness. There was syrup at the bottom and it was topped with A LOT of blueberries, and whipped cream. I am glad that they were wild blueberries and not the regular ones, because wild blueberries are sweeter and smaller.

I tried my best to eat it all, no matter how hungry and good it was. I couldn't finish it. I brought them home, and they taste just as good the day after if you warm it up! 

I only wish that this place is closer to the heart of toronto, so i can visit it more often. But i don't mind making a trip just to come here. 

This restaurant is going on my list of favourite restaurants. 5/5 for decor and ambiance, impressive service, exceptional food and overall experience! This is the kind of restaurant that wouldn't mind paying $18 for pancakes. I am definitely coming back, either for the pancakes or something else on their menu."}
{"text":"This place often involves extremely long wait, which usually highly inflates my expectations. Ive been here twice now, and I haven't been disappointed. 

First time I was here I ordered the scones and blueberry buttermilk pancakes. The scones were good. The pancakes were mind blowing! They were fluffy and the level of sweetness was just right. I do recommend this to be shared though, as three pieces of pancakes was a bit too much.. 

Second time I was here, I ordered Veda's choice (with smoked salmon) and also got to try the skillet. The croissant and salmon tasted so great together. And the skillet, mildly spicy but the salsa was perfect. The portion of both dishes was somewhat small however. It was perfect for me, but I don't have a huge appetite. Another amazing item on the menu was the yogurt and granola. It uses unsweetened yogurt, but it goes so well with the sweetness from the fruits and granola."}
{"text":"The pancakes with blueberry compote lived up to the hype, which is hard to do in Toronto. I rarely order pancakes in restaurants because they're never better than mom's homemade. Dare I say Mildred's are better..."}
{"text":"We got here around 2:30pm on Good Friday, and there was still a 30 min wait for brunch. The scones and biscuits were delicious. The Huevos Monty, with black bean inside a crisp tortillas, covered with salsa, guacamole, and a sunnyside egg was unique and very tasty. However, the blueberry pancakes are over-rated in my opinion from what others are saying about them in the reviews. Yes, they do look scrumptious, but it is way too much bread/flour and saturated with syrup making it too sweet. I shared an order (3 pancakes) with 2 people, and still thought it was too much... One pancake would have been just right for me. 

Overall, really great place to have a relaxing brunch. Nice atmosphere, friendly service, and delicious food. Too bad the wait time is usually long, but there's a good reason for that.  Will be back to try out some other items..."}
{"text":"I only tried their famous blueberry pancakes, but oh man these were the best pancakes I've had! So fluffy and delightful and loved it with the blueberries. It comes with syrup on it, but I asked for extra because CANADA. It is quite large, but I'm a very good eater and pretty much finished it myself. Mostly because it was so good I couldn't stop eating it!"}
{"text":"OMG PANCAKES ARE TO DIE FOR!!!! The pancakes are so fluffy and flavour but not too sweet. It's just amazing!! We ordered the scones and biscuits. Which were great too, I believe they are freshly made as they were soft and fresh. Also ordered the eggs Benedict on the crossiant. Not my fav as I'm not too into Holliday sauce. But I would def come back for the pancakes over and over and over again!!!! Lol"}
{"text":"Awesome environment and really beautiful looking/tasting food. Love it and will 100% be returning."}
{"text":"Had summerlicious menu here the ambience of the place is nice. Silver bass was good and service was excellent except for the dessert which took a bit too long to prepare. I wish that that they would of had a better menu selection for beef and chicken as I don't like pork that much. Overall the experience was very pleasant. Would give of given them a 4 if had the menu selection been better."}
{"text":"The food is really well done. Their pastry dishes- quiche crust, scones were outstanding. Portion size was a little small but the food was very good. Our waitress was very nice too. Getting seated seemed to be more chaotic then it should have been and that dampened the entire experience. There was no apparent logic to the seating and many people were standing around waiting to be seated while there were many open tables. If I were to go again- and that is a big if because of how frustrating the wait to sit was, the pancakes looked phenomenal and nothing like pancakes you see anywhere else."}
{"text":"I've heard epic things about the brunch here, however can't be bothered to wait an hour for a table to eat pancakes... So instead, we came for dinner. Rather than arriving to a line out the door, we were treated to a practically empty restaurant which allowed us to have our choice of seating, which we opted for on the patio.

Starting with the drink menu, everything is between $8.50 and $14... They have 2 beers on tap including Beau's Lagered Ale and Sidelaunch Wheat at $8.50 per pint, and 5 types of wine by the glass in the $11-$14 range. They also have a handful of custom cocktails in the $8.50 - $12 range. I certainly wouldn't make this my location for patio drinks (it could turn into an expensive afternoon pretty quick, and there isn't much view or people watching to be done), but for a beverage or two with dinner I'm neither impressed nor mad about it. 

The dinner menu is broken into Vegetable, Land, and Water. We stuck to the land and the veg for the most part...  Moroccan Spiced Chicken was decent, the Bison Short Rib was a good flavour but overcooked and a bit dry, and the Broccoli Florets were replaced by green beans that we cooked in the same style, but frankly didn't really impress and at $9 for a plate of beans, were the least impressive part of the meal.

I will admit the service was friendly and attentive, but the overall experience was just okay... Which leads me to believe if you really want to enjoy a meal here, its best to do so for brunch, which is where their kitchen and subsequent reviews really shine. Otherwise a passable 3 stars is what to expect."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Mildred's. Its located in liberty village, just across from the entrance to West Elm. They have a cute little patio and the inside of the restaurant is gorgeous; high ceilings, open concept, cool light fixtures and giant windows. I had a hard time deciding whether to eat inside or out, but went for the patio thinking this might be one of my last few warm days to enjoy it!

It was pretty busy for a Sunday afternoon. We were provided with the brunch menu-there are savoury, vegetarian, and sweet options. I was torn between their heaping pancakes or the 'Veda' meal. I went with Veda (which is egg, smoked salmon and b√©arnaise sauce on a croissant with a small garden salad) for $14. My friend had the same.

It was a good meal...but the flavours were not exceptional. Serving sizes are on the smaller size, while prices are on the higher side. I also got coffee, and refills were free.

I liked the wait service. They were really friendly, and made jokes here and there. They created a comfortable atmosphere.

All in all, Mildred's is a good brunch/lunch spot for the ambience. The food is ok, I think they could improve the flavour content for the price."}
{"text":"3.5/4 over 5
I've visited Mildred's three times now! It's a cute spot worth the 45-60 minute wait if you want brunch on the weekend. Weekdays are significantly less busy if you don't like waiting! The food is pretty consistent and tasty. Visually, very appealing and \"instagramable\" (especially their famously fluffy pancakes). 

FOOD:

Veda's Choice with Smoked Salmon: This is my go-to dish here. It's a croissant with smoked salmon, two poached eggs, and some sort of hollandaise. Served with side salad or potatoes. The dish is always served very warm and yummy! The poached eggs seep onto the croissant and the sauce is very flavorful. 

Mildred's Savoury Tart: Their tart is absolutely divine! So flaky and creamy - with some really delicious flavor throughout. It has caramelized onion, spinach, and goat's cheese inside. Essentially a flaky buttery crust with a quiche filling.

Grilled Cheese: Very much craveable. The grilled cheese is made with aged cheddar, mozzarella, and apple tomato relish, on sourdough. It's made perfectly - crispy, golden brown exterior with a chewy sweet/savory center.

Huevos Monty: I enjoyed tasting this dish - lots of elements going on. It wasn't one of my favorites as I'm not a huge fan of beans and there is a large layer of black beans in this dish which I assume is what makes it filling as it looks a bit smaller than the others.

Big Brunch Skillet: I didn't try this dish, but my friend ended up ordering something else as he and my other friend both said it tasted off and wasn't what they were expecting.

Blueberry Pancakes: Delicious and worth the hype! They are very shareable (We always order them as dessert for the table of 3-6). The pancakes themselves are very thick, fluffy, and airy. Topped with a creme fraiche, maple syrup, and wild blueberry compote. They are never too sweet or dense, and always make for a much welcomed guilty treat after their savory dishes. 


SERVICE:

The sole reason I would dock 1/1.5 stars is the consistency of service. First time we went I had to ask twice for water (which was finally brought over after ordering and being seated 10-15 min. It was a slow weekday that day so I'm not too sure why it took so long. The waiter also had to come back to double check that he took our orders right - he seemed a bit distracted the entire time. Second time I came was a Sunday. Waited about 40 minutes to be seated (as expected). The service that day was great. Very friendly, knowledgeable, and quick. One of my friends didn't like his dish too much and she insisted that he order something else instead and they brought it out right away. He was not charged for the other dish nor given any sort of attitude. Third time the waitress was friendly and energetic, however had to ask her several times to bring things as she would forget they were ordered. Had to get up and ask a different waiter to bring out some aioli and hot sauce after she forgot three times.

Overall, Mildred's is definitely worth a visit (at least once) if you're around the area! Especially to try their pancakes."}
{"text":"All Shakshuka'd Up ($15.50)
I'm more a savoury breakfast kind of gal and this was absolutely delicious. It had a good amount of spiciness to it along with the tomatoes and the eggs were perfectly runny.

Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes ($16.50)
Super fluffy and very tasty. As you will see from my picture below, it makes for an awesome Instagram picture. You get 3 pancakes with a dollop of whipped cream, blueberries and syrup.

My friend and I ordered our own dishes and shared the pancakes.  We left full and satisfied.  Only downside was the 1 hour and 20 min wait but it was definitely because of our timing (Sunday after St. Patty's). To pass the time, you can always walk around Liberty Village or sit at Balzac's. 

Washroom experience was quite humorous as they play Air Canada boarding calls and luggage announcements. Decor creates a very open feeling and it's bright. Music choice was great too but maybe not ideal if you're super hungover as it was a little bit louder than I had expected. Nothing a great brunch can't fix though!

Last thing to note, this weekend brunch was a little bit on the pricier side for me so definitely not an every weekend kind of thing unless you can afford it (then be my guest)."}
{"text":"I decided that I am a fan mostly because it's a great place to bring a 15-month toddler.  With my neice who is just starting to walk around and loves to explore, we have been disappointed frequently with places that are not very kid-friendly...either without high chairs, dark lighting, or so forth.  This place is great...spacious, clean, and very kid-friendly.  The service is great and it's a wonderful place to have breakfast or brunch....the spacious ambiance and clean contemporary decor immediately perks up your morning!  I absolutely LOVE the chic silky pillows at the table seating...creates a cozy environment...very inviting and simply beckons you to have a great bite with some great company.

Although it is on the pricier side, the food is also wonderful...had the grilled cheese and the bread was perfectly crusty and the relish was a perfect compliment to the sandwich...sweet, a bit tart, and a bit of a spicy kick.  Great coffee was also a plus!  love this place and would definitely visit again..."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot with some of the best croissants in town. A bit pricey but a great spot for a lunch date with your significant other or family that's in town."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best pancakes I have had in my entire life. This coming from a girl whose lived down South and whose grandma is probably rolling over in her grave for such a treasonous proclamation. But I cannot tell a lie.

I did a ton of research on brunch spots in Toronto before venturing off for a summer retreat in the city. Mildred's is mentioned on several \"Best Of\" lists so I knew I had to make dining here part of my itinerary. Thankfully, Mildred's serves B'lunch (brunch and lunch) during the week which was perfect for my crazy overbooked schedule; I came here on a Monday.

Mildred's is located in a contemporary outdoor shopping plaza about a 20 minute bus ride from central Toronto. It's modernly decorated with an astute chromatic finish and minimal touches of wood, glass and clever housewares. Not the feel you'd expect from a place that sound's like you're going to farm country, but it works.

On to the food: My friend and I both ordered the Veda's Choice -- \"Poached eggs on a flaky croissant with your choice of smoked salmon or rosemary bacon smothered in b√©arnaise sauce, served with mixed greens.\" I got it with the smoked salmon and my friend got it with the bacon. Both were absolutely delicious. Why more people do not use a b√©arnaise sauce instead of watery 'ol hollandaise I do not know. We then shared an order of the Mrs. Biederhof's Legendary Light & Fluffy Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes. Oh. My. God. I was in love. The pancakes come with Lanark County maple syrup (the legendary maple syrup capital of Ontario), wild blueberry compote & whipped cream. $16 is quite a lot for a stack of pancakes but these are worth every penny. You can't say you've experienced Mildred's Temple Kitchen without trying these pancakes.

Service here was standard. The food, however, was absolutely worth the journey. I will definitely come back here on my next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday around 11am. They don't take reservations and told us (party of 4) it would be a 1h20m wait. It actually only took 1hour but we walked Round until they texted us so it was ok! 

And it was worth the wait. The space is really nice - cozy but spacious. 

Food - pancakes are amazing. We got one order for the table which was a good choice since they are sweet. I had the Veda with smoked salmon which was delicious. However, it came with a side salad that was incredibly boring. If only it had a maple vinaigrette...Or really anything! It was just some greens and I think olive oil and lemon juice? My SO ordered the skillet and it was really yummy. 

Service - nice and gracious, but very slow. I had to ask two different ppl serving our table for a new glass (mine had some stuff floating in it). It took so long that the food arrived before my glass of water. 

I'm glad I waited, this place was really great. I took off a star for the boring salad and slow service. However, all of us agreed that it was worth the wait and prices."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of great things about Mildred's Temple and I was not disappointed during my visits. The restaurant itself is a big open space with an airy yet inviting environment. There is a section towards the back of the restaurant where you can see your food being prepared. The staff are all very cheery and informative. The cutlery and surroundings are very clean. For my first visit, I had the Bolly Colly - loved the curried cauliflower and the way the grapes, quinoa and yogurt all contrast with one another. For my second visit, I had their Friday lunch special - mac and cheese with bacon and deep fried onions. Loved the classed up version of such a classic childhood comfort dish. What I am really hoping to try is their famous breakfast...I've only ever came in for lunch but I do hope to come in to try out their famous breakfast dishes."}
{"text":"Well well well. I must say the first time I tried MTK was for Brunch and had a great experience however the last time was a nightmare and I will never go back. It took about 30 min to get our apps, then  after waiting an additional 30 min for our main our server got our order totally wrong so we waited an additional 20 min to receive what we ordered. My wife had the blue foot chicken and when she took her 1st bite she bit into it and it was blatantly raw! We told the server, she was apologetic and offered to remake it.... at this point we were fed up, paid for what we had and left. Sad experience especially considering you're paying so much for a nice meal and a total waste of time."}
{"text":"The huevos here are SO great! Perfectly cooked eggs on top of tortillas with beans in between mmmm goodness. I also had some of the croissant with egg and it was good but I preferred the huevos. My only complaint is that I ordered the scones with jam and they weren't warmed up."}
{"text":"Mildred's Temple Kitchen is well known for their famous pancakes, cocktails, and a variety of other well prepared dishes.  I understand the appeal, but I can't say I'm particularly impressed, either.  Celiacs should not go out of their way to eat here.  Their food isn't as delicious as the price would need to substantiate.  Service is okay, and I actually had to have my cocktail returned as the bartender put something I forewarned being allergic to in my drink.  Meh."}
{"text":"My mum had been raving about MTK for ages, so I finally took my parents there for lunch, and it lived up to its expectations in every way imaginable. They have a large open plan space with huge windows and light, airy decor, which gives the place a friendly, yet fashionable, vibe. We arrived before the lunch rush, and we received exceptional service from all the staff members, and one of them even brought over a heater especially for us. 

We had the huevos, the MTK burger and the blueberry pancakes. All of the food was lovely. The huevos came with a lovely avocade pur√©e, the burger was cooked perfectly. And the pancakes, oh, you just have to try them to find out. Heavenly.

Oh, and the Caesars were awesome, completely. And that's coming from a total Caesar snob."}
{"text":"No reservations taken for weekend brunch.

Came at 12:30pm last Saturday, parked for $8/3 hours at nearby lot. We were told to expect a 1 hour wait and put down our phone # to be texted when the table is ready, but thankfully it only took about 30 minutes. 

Interior was a LOT larger than I expected. 

We ordered the famous blueberry pancakes, the huevos monty, and the biscuit/scone combo. 

Scone = OK, had lemon/currants
Biscuit = buttery and delicious, preferred this over the scone 
Huevos Monty = decent, better than it looked, but would have been better with more sauce or something else to provide more flavour
Fluffy Blueberry Pancakes = you'll see pictures of these all over Instagram. Decadent and really well made - not a fan of blueberries but still enjoyed this"}
{"text":"Mildred's is completely overrated, the food was meh, expensive, and the service left little to be desired. Sorry to say, I would definitely not come back!

I came here on a Tuesday (Canada Day) for brunch expecting a really long wait at the door ,but was surprisingly seated right away at the high tables, overlooking the kitchen. My boyfriend and I ordered our drinks, but quickly realized the A/C was not working and it was about 35 degrees inside....5 mins later we were sweating but decided to stay and order  food anyway, since we had heard good things.

We ordered off a pretty limited brunch menu and we expected that we would be done within the hour and a half that we allotted for ourselves. Our food, however, never arrived....everyone around us was slowly getting their orders, but we waited almost 40 min. and had to continually ask our server what the hold-up was. There was NO apology and NO explanation from her, and certainly no respite from the heat inside the restaurant. She didn't offer us any food or coffee refills in the meantime. If we had been told earlier that the A/C was broken and that the wait would be so long, we wouldn't have stepped foot in that place.

I'm not typically that impatient of a person, but it was ridiculous. We finally flagged down the manager, and he did apologize for the wait and asked us if we wanted our food packed to go once it was ready. At that point we just wanted to leave and take the food home, plus we were happy catch the rest of the soccer game we had missed during all this time.

We naively expected the Manager to comp at least one of our meals to keep us satisfied and perhaps come back, but instead he just dropped off the bill and let us know that the coffee/grapefruit juice was on them and then ran away. That barely made up for the hour we wasted, the general discomfort sitting there in sweat, and the hunger of watching everybody's food being cooked - except ours. Nice try Mildred's! I'd say work on your customer service skills and train your staff better. It was a complete flop and totally threw off our whole morning."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my partner and two friends on Oct. 29.  We were celebrating my birthday and thought we'd check it out.  Being relatively new to the area, it's always fun to check out new places.  It was a great choice.  From the moment we walked in, the service was incredible.  Everyone was very attentive and professionally friendly.  Our server was name Maya (SP?) she was delightful, and very knowledgeable.  Our food was amazing, and they had a little surprise for me at the end.  I'm not into desserts at all so they prepared a beautiful plate with Mexican style salsa and such,  and some delicious tortilla type chips that were still warm.  This was thoughtful, creative, and beyond what you would expect.  Made the evening very memorable.  I will definitely return, and I will definitely tell people about Mildred's!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst!!! Bad service.. Bad service... Slow service... Slow Service!!! I ordered the pancakes, I'm 2/3 done with my food but not fully completed and the dude comes by and takes my place without asking me if I'm done first... He smiled and said I'm sorry.. Smh!!! I'm never coming back to this place... Fuck this place!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this for a very long time. It was nice, the setting has an industrial feel but it doesn't really differ much than your typical brunch place."}
{"text":"They really keep pushing it up...I'm almost willing to cave and give it that last star.

We came in a rather busy Sunday at 1PM. The place was packed as usual and the hostess told us 25 mins at least. After seating what seemed like an endless number of tables, our hopes were fading and she swooped in with a great table and genuine apologies.

The usual fare, top notch, the delicious scones, the amazing heuvos and the eggs....I'm not going too bore you with details. You can glance at the table next to you and decide.

Yes, it's pricey, but hmmm.....it's worth the combination of atmosphere, service and food. No one said Toronto was cheap.

This is speaking of brunch of course, when I'm usually most relaxed and the bank account is an afterthought."}
{"text":"I have been trying to find time to enjoy this place for quite long now, after seeing all these photos and ravings about their pancakes. I am glad I did, their pancakes are crazy amazing! Unfortunately, that was all that was amazing in terms of food. Everything else was pretty blah. The atmosphere was nice, very open and bright. It felt like eating inside your own newly renovated kitchen by your countryside open concept home. The serving staff was friendly, but lacking. We visited them on a weekday, and they only had 2 serving staff on hand. We had to wait pretty long for everything."}
{"text":"So those pancakes everyone's talking about, the \"famous\" blueberry pancakes, yeah no. Go back home and make yourself some better pancakes.

We ordered our food and it took 30 minutes to come. People who ordered after us and who ordered the EXACT same thing, got their food before us. We only got our food after we asked them to see what's going on.

Blueberry pancakes - dry af, it looked fluffy but it was definitely NOT inside. Barely any blueberry sauce or syrup. Also it was $16 for 3 \"fluffy\" pancakes, though they were filling, it just did not seem worth it

Veda's Choice - basically a croissant with smoke salmon, poach eggs and it came with some salad. It was good, delicious BUT the croissant sandwich was literally the size of my small asian hands! Like not even, it was like 4.5\". And that cost $15. If you wanted some potatoes with that, it would be extra (which they didn't say how much when I was ordering). Honestly you can make this at home, WHICH I'm about to do. 

Mimosa - we didn't order it but I think its worth talking about. For one champagne glass mimosa costs $16. We ordered their $6 drinks at the bottom of the menu which was like 2.5x the amount in a mimosa. So if you want a mimosa, make it at home, save yourself the time and trouble and money. 

Service - alright, awkward waiter but he was nice. 

Interior - was nice, that's it, but people are there for the food 90% of the time so it doesn't matter 

Patio - we didn't get to sit at their patio or outdoor seating, whatever you want to call it, but we sat near the door. Literally only about 7 tables out there. The SMALLEST brunch patio. The wait for the patio was almost an hour. Not worth it. 

Conclusion - this review was a 2 star at first but after writing all this, it's just a 1 star. Make brunch in the comfort of your own home guys. Save your money  the food was so disappointing we didn't even take pictures of it. Looked like they quickly put it together after we called them out on being late.



also would not recommend or go back (obviously)"}
{"text":"Donna and kevin do a grand brunch.
The space is elegant and comfortable while be open and minimalist.
The service efficient and seamless.
The food beautifully presented and tasty.

{"text":"OMG my favorite brunch place with the best pancakes and scones I've ever had in my entire life! the first time I went, when we waited for long time the even give us complimentary scones. I'm the kind of person who would never order scones, but after that I always order scones here!"}
{"text":"A HOT weekend brunch place here! I haven't visited this restaurant for over 3 years. It is still awesome, we ordered the signature blueberry butttermilk pancakes, scones for 2, and big brunch skillet!"}
{"text":"When you see \"Toronto's fluffiest pancakes is at Mildred's\", it is 100% true. The buttermilk blueberry pancakes are just perfection. They're not TOO sweet. I always have to have an order of the pancakes whenever I come here. I must add that I have only been here for brunch. The great thing about these pancakes is that you can order a side order of them. This way I can also have my second favorite dish, Veda's Choice - poached eggs on a flaky croissant topped with Bearnaise sauce. You can have this with a choice of smoked salmon or bacon. I always get it with smoked salmon because.. smoked salmon. 

Mildred's is the perfect place to have brunch whether it be a date or meeting up with a friend to catch up. 

Please note that Mildred's does not take reservations on weekends.. but I guess good things come to those who wait :) totally worth the wait.. trust me."}
{"text":"I like the layout and the decor here. 
Service was friendly and prices are reasonable. My only concern is how long it took for us to actually get our meals. Other than that the food is tasty and you can tell that's it's quality. So if you don't mind waiting an hour for your meal this should be your go to brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Just TOO busy, I have failed twice to get a seat for myself and my boyfriend. I wasn't even that late! A bit past 11am. They told me wait time was 2 hours and 40 minutes for 2 people... Even after 3 hours (although I went somewhere else) they didn't call me back. I want to try these blue pancakes but will I want to waste 3 hours of my life just waiting for one? I don't know, maybe."}
{"text":"A friend and I came here on a Saturday a few weeks ago for breakfast/brunch. Disclaimer-- we were tourists visiting from the states, so not particularly familiar with Toronto's neighborhoods or the city's brunch scene. Mildred's Temple Kitchen is handily located in Liberty Village for any & all of your pre-TFC gameday needs. The menu is decent, with options outside of your usual eggs benny / pancakes / french toast brunch options, and the space is beautiful and airy (if a little sterile).

My friend had the blueberry pancakes, and let me tell you, they are absolutely worth the hype. Service staff neglected to bring us maple syrup, but they were incredible as is, anyway: moist, fluffy, buttery & sweet and topped with fresh whipped cream & blueberry compote. I had the day's special, an eggs benedict over fishcakes, which was also delicious. Their home fries are fried to a crisp, not oily & soggy-- some of the best I've had.

Parking is a little difficult to find in the area, but if you're down by Liberty Village on a weekend, this is a stand-out place to get brunch. I'm sure their lunch and dinner offerings are just as good."}
{"text":"This has been my fav spot and my BF and I celebrate our anniversary here every year as it is where he took me on our first date. The pancakes are so adorable!!! Hope it can diversify the menu a bit so we keep visiting!!!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch on Sunday. We showed up at 9:05 AM and we were right at the start of the line, but the line got very long after us very quick so I wouldn't show up much later if you want to get in right away.

We ordered the huevos monty and the blueberry pancakes. I didn't think there was anything special about the huevos monty except that it was very beautifully presented. The eggs were a little too undercooked for my liking, and I think the flavors were very predictable so a good solid three stars.

The blueberry pancakes were very, very good. I found them to be a little too crumbly on their own such that you NEEDED to put syrup and whipped cream in a bite (if you're already the type to load up on those then you're golden). I happened to think that the pancakes were sweet enough on their own and was almost too sweet with the syrup so it felt a little lose-lose, but it's definitely worth visiting nonetheless!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, great atmosphere.  Priced reasonably. The huevos rancheros may be my favorite in Toronto."}
{"text":"YAAAAASSSSSS KWWWWWEEEEEENNNNNSSSS!!!!! 

Best brunch spot in Toronto. 
The scones, the pancakes, the eggs, the steak, everything -- loved it, loved it loved it loved it. 

Had a friend come in from out of town, picked her up bright and early and came to this wonderful place, and we ate SO MUCH. 

The decor is also wonderful - quite sunny and bright. I love it. Can't wait till I am back."}
{"text":"I usually try not to judge a restaurant on their Summerlicious menu and service. This is an exception.

Ambiance - MTK is a beautifully designed restaurant - inside and out. Inside is airy and spacious. Outside is bordered by a beautiful garden and expansive patio umbrellas. It's an upscale casual place.

Service - Everyone is nice. However, everyone is not fast. Being seated? Fast. Being served? Ehhhhh. We waited for our mains, desserts, refills, and bill. When it's a lunch during a work week, we don't have the luxury of time per se. To be fair, our server was nice despite having to work in a heat wave.

Food - Did I love my food? Nope. Did I enjoy it? For the most part, yes. Note: I'm describing the food as I experienced it. Restaurant descriptors are always so enhanced.
1st course - tomato goat cheese arugula salad. This was yum. 
2nd course - pulled pork hash with beans and a sunny-side egg in a cast iron skillet. It was okay. It was hard to differentiate the components of the dish. It was essentially a mash of everything. 
3rd course - honey cake with strawberry rhubarb compote, toasted oat sprinkles, and whipped cream. This was also yum.
Side note about the food: My friend's fish tacos were ridiculously small. He only got two of them and the fish were TINY. Definitely a ripoff.

Value - $20 plus tax and tip. More than what I'd usually spend on a work lunch. I'm on the fence on whether this meal was worth it or not. I don't know if I'll come back here for Summerlicious.

Overall - It's a solid OK. Lovely space. Decent food. Service is a bit slow."}
{"text":"I was surprised that this only has 3.5 stars! I came from brunch on a Saturday morning at about 9:30am, and there was no wait.

{"text":"Blueberry Pancakes!  That is all I can say. They are fluffy, stacked, DELICIOUS!

Great decor, and our server Kimberly was awesome. She had great recommendations for us. 

I will definitely go back on my next visit!"}

The food here was amazing - we got the blueberry pancakes (store specialty) and brunch special of a pork katsu topped with a sunny side up. Definitely worth the wait and we will come back to try other items on the menu very soon!"}
{"text":"There ain't nothing better on a summertime afternoon than a lunchtime quickie....a nooner, as it were. That's what MTK is offering up this summer. I follow them on Twitter and last week I got a lunch notice that they were serving up a lunch quickie for $15. Now $15 bucks might seem a bit steep for lunch, no question but if the quality is there, and there ain't no nouveau cuisine in sight, then it might be worth it. 

A really old friend came in to town last Friday morning and we decided to check out the lunchtime special at MTK. They have a patio (nothing near as lovely and vine covered as the old Sudbury St. site) but we opted to sit inside. It is such a large, open space and the breeze was delightful. The lunchtime special features a soup/sandwich & dessert combo. They don't offer up a choice which for some could be problematic. For me, on Friday, it worked. You can also order off of the regular menu. So the lunch special for Friday was a bowl of Roasted Red Pepper Soup, a Roast Beef sandwich with aged cheddar & a Butter Pecan square. So we went with it. 

The soup was deeeeelicious! Really nice blend of flavours and I couldn't taste any flour (which what is often used to thicken these types of soup). It was garnished with a long slice of yellow zucchini that was curled up in the middle of the bowl with a great Nasturtium leaf beside it. My only complaint about the soup was that it could have been a bit hotter. I am just one of those people who likes her soup hot. 

The sandwich was grilled, thick and oozing with cheese, medium rare roast beef, caramelized onions and some sort of Dijon mustard/mayonnaise. The sandwich was very filling and the only thing I didn't care for was that they used too much of that Dijon mayonnaise mixture. It was very tasty though. On the sandwich plate was also the pecan square. The squares are very similar to the Dufflet's Pecan squares sans the chocolate. 

All in all, it was a pleasant lunch. Relaxed, with comfy seating and a lovely breeze around us. Even though it was the \"quickie\" lunch special we took our time and enjoyed the visit with each other and at no time did I feel like they were trying to rush out the door. I mentioned earlier that for some $15 might be a pricy lunch but I felt for the quality, the volume and the presentation we certainly got our money's worth.  As per my usual self I've pasted up some epicurean pics of lunch. 

One last thing.....what the hell is up with the washrooms?  Instead of elevator music you get an audio of a flight attendant going over the airplane specifics prior to taking off.  Huh?  Am I going somewhere when I sit down to pee?"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 4.5 stars I would because I really would just like sausage (or bacon) & eggs with some toast but it's not on the menu for brunch. But since I can't I'll just post 5 stars since there are very few brunch locations open at 9am on a Sunday.

Truly a nice and airy feeling when you dine here. The staff are nice & attentive.

The food is fresh & filling even though it's located in Liberty Village which notorious for being over priced."}
{"text":"Came on Christmas Eve morning, no lineup! Guess I know what I'll be doing next Christmas Eve :) Our party of 3 ordered the famous blueberry pancakes, the quiche and skillet with a side of sausage. My hot chocolate was very rich. The first time I had the quiche was very memorable so I had to order it again. This time it was a bit cold. Perhaps I took too long to take photos, but there were a bunch of tarts lying on the side of the kitchen counter for the busy holidays. The pancakes are always a must order! Skillet was very hot; also good if you want some meat with your breakfast. Food portions were generous and we needed a nap right after."}
{"text":"Good food, great service. If you don't mind the wait I say it's worth it. The pancakes are yummy"}
{"text":"Setting: quite impressive new-age decor. Very spacious indoors and foliage lined smaller outdoor section. Has a bit of a museum restaurant feel to it. 

Staff: friendly and relatively quick despite our large order

Food: not personally a huge fan of the brunch scene with all its sunny-side bells and kale-enriched whistles, but this was definitely surprisingly tasty. The eggs morty and skillet are hearty without becoming greasy. Side of bacon is worth it. Ask for the special Home made chilli sauce for an extra kick."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here, but as everyone says the decor is super nice.  There's often a wait (both this time and the last time I was here).  

The brunch menu is limited but rather delicious.  The portion sizes are also small.  Having a side order of their biscuits is recommended...they're super tasty with a pat of butter...mmm butter...

I ordered something eggs benny like (yummy), and last time I had something that was mexican influenced with avocados....

A lovely experience, but I prefer my regular brunch places"}
{"text":"I love going here for a brunch date with my SO or my friends. The atmosphere is very cute and has a very hipster vibe. The area is very open with great natural light for pictures. I love getting the pancakes here, and they are quite possibly the best pancakes I've ever eaten! It very fluffy and sweet. They are very generous with the syrup and blueberries. If you find that it's not enough, they'll be happy to give you more toppings. I also had their Manhandler, a very savory dish for brunch but appropriate if you have a hardy appetite. They usually serve it with greens but substituted it for fries. 

Pros:
- the decor in the restaurant is everything. It minimalistic but suits the aroma perfectly. 
- very comfortable seating
- friendly staff

Cons:
- depending on time and day, there could be a line up so if you can make reservations 
- pricey for brunch, the order of pancakes was 16.00 before taxes
- Parking is pretty hard to find. There is street parking, but you are only allowed to for a maximum of 20 mins. There is a private parking lot about a block away but it is roughly 3.00 per hour"}
{"text":"GROSS.  I read reviews of people raving about the brunch... NOPE.  

The place looks chic, airy, it's a buzzed about resto.  But NOPE NOPE.  Food is over priced, small portions.  I love a delicious small portion plate, but this wasn't delicious. 

I think this was the first Rancheros I didn't finish... Not because I was full, but because it tasted awful and I wished I picked up some wedges from the Metro and fried my own egg at home. 

Came back for dinner a few months later, again, would recommend to branch out to another resto in the village."}
{"text":"I bought the hype about the pancake and was really disappointed or maybe I was expecting too much not sure but will not try again."}
{"text":"THE BEST Pancakes on Earth!!!  Really something special!!  If you come to Toronto you have to eat at least one breakfast here.  The wait for brunch on Sunday was an hour and 45 minutes long and I understand why.  I wish they had another restaurant in America (hint, hint) like maybe Westchester County, NY.  The manhandler was also very good and tasty."}
{"text":"I only have one thing to say. Before I die I must come back for those blueberry pancakes. 

Service 5/5
Atmosphere 5/5 - casual, clean, trendy
Food 5/5
Price reasonable 

I suggest you make a reservation  . On Sundays they don't take reservations so try to beat the rush and get there early, the wait might be 20mins but if you are there later it is 45mins to 1.5hrs *gaspppp* 

I really liked the pulled pork dish and the pancakes.  Sometimes I dream about them. Mildreds  is now one of my favourite places for brunch I can't wait to bring my other friends here!"}
{"text":"Interesting place for Sunday Brunch.  Very accommodating and nice servers.   Not a lot of egg Benny's options. But food options were tasty.  We had the blueberry pancakes to share.  The smoked salmon fris√©e salad was good and the manhandler."}
{"text":"Long waits & the food was good but nothing spectacular.  The scones/biscuits are way overpriced & you get the smallest amount of jelly to go with it. I got the granola & it was ok.. I wouldn't wait 1.5 hours for it again though."}
{"text":"My date wanted to take me out for brunch today, and chose Mildred's Temple Kitchen! He warned me ahead of time that the wait time can take as long as 2 hours. I was mortified when I heard this and told myself I refuse to line up. So, I set my alarm clock for 7:30am just so I can avoid line-ups. I arrived to the restaurant at 9:50am, and the hostess said a table in the dining room would be ready for me in 20 minutes! I was completely thrown off, because for sure I thought I would get a table since I arrived there so early in the morning. However, there were immediate seats available at the bar, if you're desperate. The hostess asked me for my phone #, so she can immediately shoot me a text message once a table becomes open. I had some time to kill so I went to the washroom. There were 4 individual stalls in the washroom which can be used by both genders. There was also a large seating area in the back, which I thought was a great idea. I spent my time sitting there waiting for my date, making myself feel at home. I also thought it was cool how they had boarding announcements playing in the washroom. It makes you feel like you're at the airport. 

When my date arrived, our table was finally ready for us! It took no longer than 20 minutes, like what the hostess already mentioned. The restaurant was beautiful, with a lot of open space , open kitchen and windows which allow natural lighting to emit through. The brunch menu was very small, and not crazily extensive. I liked the simplicity! we ordered the restaurant's most popular items. This included: the infamous blueberry pancakes, the Veda's choice and some buttermilk scones. Everything I had was delicious and the presentations were a piece of artwork. With the natural lighting in the restaurant, why not take some pictures of your food? They're definitely Instagram worthy! :D I also asked for a cup of cappuccino, which came with a heart. I was actually a little bit disappointed, because the heart looked so sloppy!!! I'm a big fan of cappuccino art/latte art, but my heart looked more like a circle trying to get a face lift. Nonetheless, I had a great experience and really appreciated the staffs' enthusiasm and customer service. I will definitely be back.... but will be here even earlier! ;)"}
{"text":"I took my son here for Xmas. We did the breakfast. The venue is beautiful. It is absolutely breathtaking and would be great for a wedding. You can see the kitchen and the chefs preparing food. The stables and chairs are very spread out so there is lots of room. I haven't seen many restaurants do this as they are more concerned about squeezing the maximum amount of people. 

The food was wonderful! They have something for everyone. The staff is delightful! I look forward to trying their dinner next! Perhaps I'll take my husband on a date night here:)"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch and the blueberry pancakes were so good, light flavorful and lovely fresh cream and blueberry compote.  The only downfall was having to wait an hour after we were told half an hour.  We had two young kids so that was difficult.  Service was friendly and the manager or owner came over many times to speak and check in on us. The food was seasoned and cooked well."}
{"text":"A decent brunch place located in Liberty village. The interior decor inside this place is amazing, modern and clean. Usually there's a 30 min-1hr wait depending on when you arrive, but they have a system to text you when the tables ready.

As for the actual food, it's just decent. I've been to mildreds 3-4 times. I've gotten really bored of it and find it mostly overrated. However, you're probably going because of the blueberry pancake hype and they are well worth it. Really fluffy delicious pancakes, one of the best I've had at a brunch place. However, the other dishes I find mostly mediocre and not very satisfying (eggs benny, quiche, etc). Most of the dishes come with a boring arugula side salad and don't have much substance. Probably overpriced for what you're getting. Recommend getting a side of pancakes if you order a different dish (you can get smaller portions to share with a friend.

Overall, would say worth trying once for the pancakes but otherwise, it's just decent for the price."}
{"text":"We went for my girlfriend's birthday brunch and our experience was far from pleasant.. Waited an hour and a half to be seated even though there were empty spots everywhere.

Finally sat down and ordered. From the time we ordered, to actually being served our food, we waited another full hour (not kidding) 2 hours wasted. Had to keep feeding the parking meter because it took forever to eat. 

The only thing positive about this place was the food. The Grilled cheese was delicious and the skillet was good too, but that's it.."}
{"text":"The best buttermilk pancake ever! And hashbrown was just perfect. Not burnt, completely cooked golden brown! Just right amount of seasoning, too. Loved it. Had to drive nearly an hour but it really well paid off.

Only minus is had to wait almost an hour. The place is really packed. They take reservations during the weekdays, but not on the weekends."}
{"text":"pancakes are to die for!! such a great brunch spot in toronto!"}
{"text":"Been here for both brunch and dinner. Both are pretty damn good, but brunch is definitely where this place has it pretty nailed down. 

If you plan to get a spot, COME EARLY. LIKE AS SOON AS THE OPEN early. This cute place gets packed way too quickly, but I don't expect anything less from a great brunch place and being in liberty village.  

We came at 11am, waited for around two hours (really not that bad as there's lots to see/shop on Queen West... Unless you're starving. You're going to have a bad time.). 

I got the salad and my friend got a Bennie. Both were the bombdiggity. You know when you're close to the bottom of a salad and it's just the indulgent toppings you really want? Well the entire salad was just like that, from start to finish. 

And you HAVE to try the desserts. Come on, at least one, you waited for so long and trust me it's worth it. 

I will definitely be coming here again for more indulgent brunches."}
{"text":"Mildred's temple kitchen is an odd little place in a somewhat strange location.

MTK is located in a part of Toronto I normally don't go to and it's sandwiched in between several other buildings at the top of a staircase that leads down straight to the nearest road, rather odd but sort of cool at the same time.  The restaurant has an outdoor patio with free water and watermelon for people passing by, which is also somewhat odd but a nice little touch I guess.

I can't say much about the decor of the place since my friends and I sat outside, but I can say that the outdoor patio had quite literally no view because of the way the building is positioned, which is sort of a downer.  My friends and I all ordered the MTK burger as well as the gnocchi poutine.  The poutine was quite unbelievable, an interesting little treat that you don't encounter often if at all anywhere else.  The burger and fries were pretty good.  The fries were crispy and tasty, and while the burger was also pretty good it left a little to be desired.  While ordering we noticed that the menu said the burger did not come with cheese as an option.  I figured it would be because the patty itself was so delicious that the cheese would just ruin the experience, but I found that in reality the patty was just alright but nothing great.  It could have greatly benefited from cheese or other toppings.  The price of the burger and fries was about $15, not too bad.

Overall Mildred's temple kitchen was decent but I wouldn't find much reason to go back"}
{"text":"Keep in mind their online menu is not always what you get in the restaurant

Their blueberry pancakes... Heaven!
I ordered a side of scrambled eggs to TRY to balance out that huge insulin spike but those pancakes are perfect"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gift to your breakfast cravings. We went for a Friday brunch and still had to wait about 45mins but it was worth it. Maybe an off day as service was a little off (drinks took longer then food) but fortunately the food made up for that. I would definitely return and get the same meal"}
{"text":"One of the best places in town for breakfast or brunch on a weekend but it's almost always busy! But It's worth the 30-40min wait.

-pancakes with blueberry is very good portion, and tastes amazing, even if you get it as a side dish you'll be stuffed but you won't regret it.

- salmon croissant is very good aswell

- steak & eggs are good and don't make you feel heavy after even though its a pretty big plate so that's a bonus."}
{"text":"I'm with Elaine. There's a lot I want to like about this place. Nice interior. Spacious. They were playing Get Smart (the 1960s tv show) on their big screen until some stupid hockey game came on. There's an interesting mix of extra-provincial beers I've never seen before. Wait staff is friendly and attentive. But it tends to fall down in the kitchen.

1) Slow. It seemed to take about an hour for our mains to arrive. How hard is it to do up some burgers, a rare flank steak and some chicken? The chicken dish had obviously sat out for so long waiting for the other mains to be prepared that the dc who ordered the chicken received it cold. She could only finish half of it before giving up on a cold piece of bird. 

2) Prices. Mildred's seems to have innovated the idea you can bring financial core prices to Liberty Village. 

I had the burger and fries. $18. If they advertised it for what it was, a slider and fries and charged $9, it would be the best darn slider on the planet. But I would be embarrassed to the charge $18 for a micro sized burger with a whole lot of no fixins.

The draft is some equally crazy price, like $8.50 a pint. 

If they worked on prices, it would be a 4 star for sure.

Seriously. What the hell is with dining out these days in Toronto when every joe joint with a table cloth wants to charge you $20 for a burger and fries?"}
{"text":"The blueberry pancakes changed the game forever. Will come again and again just for them."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend on Fathers Day with my boyfriend for brunch. Surprisingly we didn't have to wait for a table. We were seated immediately, but near the entrance. Not the best seat in the house, actually it might be the worst lol but it's ok, we were hungry. 

The set menu consisted of a drink (fresh grapefruit or orange juice) a scone and biscuit and your entree. This costed $25/person. 

We both got grapefruit juice. He got the croissant Benedict and I got the quiche (forgot what they were both called on the menu, but essentially those were what we were served). 

The fresh grapefruit juice was true to it's name -no complaints there. They came out with one scone and one biscuit, but we we're suppose to get one scone and biscuit each. Now because we were seated near the entrance it was hard to wave someone down. When we finally did, the server went to check if we were actually suppose to get another one of each.. This took awhile. When he came back he brought us another two and apologized. Then we realized that someone had taken a bite out of the scone.. So we had to wave another server down to let them know. She then came back with butter... What??? We explained an showed her the scone and she glady took it back and brought us a new one. 

After all this, we felt like the service drastically improved as more attention was paid to us. Our original waitress finally came back and kept asking if the food was alright, if we needed anything and even insisted on packing our food at the end. 

All in all, not the best experience. I definitely expected more from all the hype. The food was mediocre.. Definitely fresh and well plated though. The salads that came with both dishes were the same and nothing special. The croissant was really soft and buttery. It mingled with the fresh salmon and  poached egg.  The quiche was really light, airy and fluffy. It was good, but not as good as the croissant Benedict. I felt like the price of the meal went mostly towards the ambiance and location instead of the food..

Let's just say everything that came out of the oven, was fantastic. Those scones and biscuits were absolutely delicious. Why else would we go through the trouble of getting seconds?? (Well besides the fact we are paying for it anyway)."}
{"text":"Overpriced, yes. Delicious, sometimes. The first time we came here I got the eggs Benedict. I asked them to put it on sour dough bread and it was absolutely wonderful. The service was great too. The second time we came back our service sucked, they kept forgetting about us. Also, they burned the bread....not once, not twice, but three times. I kept sending it back. The bread was black. We haven't been back since, but I sure we will be again one day and give it another shot. Their grapefruit juice was wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Mildred's Temple Kitchen is like a breath of fresh air. The wall of windows, the open concept kitchen and simple decor just seems to get you started on the right foot, especially if it's your first meal of the day (they serve a solid brunch). 

My most recent experience though was last Saturday when my family took my mother out for her birthday. We requested the big group table on the raised level beside the kitchen, which provided a spectacular view of the whole restaurant and the ceiling to floor windows along the one side of it My niece was supplied with a placemat and crayons to colour it with to her hearts content while we enjoyed great food, great service and great company. Being on the raised level made it feel more private for us as we enjoyed -- to start -- shared plates of gnocchi poutine, bread and olive platter and mussels. 
My meal the bolly cauli was delicious and satisfying. 
While I prefer it as a breakfast spot, I wouldn't hesitate to return for dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing, just amazing! I ordered the veda's choice, the croissant was perfectly flaky with deliciously poached eggs. My friends ordered the Huevos Monty & the Big Brunch Skillet. Both turned out great as well. We had their famous Mrs. Biederhof's Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes and I must say, they live up to their reputation. They had just the right amount of fluffiness with the right amount of blueberries inside & blueberry compote outside. 

The downside of this place is that there's always a wait time (goes to show how great their menu is). We waited for 2 hours, grabbed coffee from a nearby starbucks and hung out in a furniture store right across."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends for dinner at Mildred's Temple Kitchen.  We made reservation using OpenTable for 6PM but they didn't have anything available until after 7.  When we got there, the restaurant was half empty so I would suggest calling in as they probably only allocate a certain number of tables for OpenTable.  The restaurant space is beautiful but the lofty space felt a bit cold with the minimalist furniture and concrete floor.

They have a few vegetarian options so I was happy.  I ordered the Golden Beets Tatin appetizer and Curried Cauliflower for main.  I am trying to avoid dairy so they were able to leave off the goat cheese and yogurt on these dishes.  Both of these dishes were fantastic.  The combination of the Golden beets, flaky pastry, arugula and tiny crisps were just delightful.  The portion was just right, presentation was beautiful, so I have nothing bad to say about it.  The Curried Cauliflower came mixed in with some quinoa.  The curry wasn't overpowering, cauliflower was roasted perfectly and the herbs really complimented the dish.  I wish there were more quinoa to balance out the abundance of cauliflower and to make the dish more filling.  I wasn't a fan of the silver bowl they served the dish in but it didn't bother me as much as the fact that they didn't give you a spoon to eat the quinoa.    

While the service was good, I felt like something was missing.  I had mentioned and asked the server to omit dairy from my dishes but she still brought butter to the table.  If she had also brought over some olive oil, I would've been impressed.  Also, I didn't order any desserts because everything had ice cream in it.  So while my friends had dessert, I had a pot of herbal tea.  The server then brings over a fork for me just in case I wanted to try some of the desserts on the table.  Normally, that is a good gesture but once again, it reminded me that she forgot about me not eating dairy.  Maybe I am expecting too much but I think it's the little things and attention to detail that differenciate between a good server and a great server."}
{"text":"Can get long wait times but definitely delicious brunch. Worth the wait. Coffee isn't the best but the food was worth the money."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great! The interior is simple but very nice. The service is great and the food is amazing.

I ordered their specialty, the pancakes. They were fluffy, and the compote was to die for! Definitely lives up to the hype!

Our server was sweet and attentive, even though the place was busy. Food came quickly as well!

I really cannot wait to come back and try some of their other options. The menu is small, but I guarantee everyone and anyone can find something they enjoy on there."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Thought it would be a 3, but indeed 4 stars for me.

Wait is long. We got there at 11:20am on Sunday and didn't get a table until 12:00pm. However, if you didn't want to wait there, you can go shop around and they will text you when your table is ready. Always love this option!

The washrooms are coed with separate rooms and sinks. It's pretty clean, which was surprising to me since it's so busy. The funniest thing for me about the washrooms is that they board-cast the airplane safety message on repeat. It's funny cause I don't understand why they do it. It's not like it's their theme so I would be curious to find out why that instead of putting on music. Definitely caught my attention!

Service was excellent! My coffee was always full and my server knew exactly when to bring extra napkins! 

We ordered the specialities:

One scone and one biscuit - scone and biscuit was buttery and tasted like heaven in my mouth. I've never liked scones, but this was fluffy, fresh, and delicious.

Pancakes - on par with all reviews. Fluffy and soft. Not too sweet. Huge portions. 

Veda's choice - croissant was soft and buttery! So fresh. Their bakery is amazing here. The sauce, egg, and smoked salmon were paired very nicely! Messy to eat, but so worth it!

We were so full! We paid about $60 for two people taxes and tip included. Reasonable for the portion size and service. On par with lots of medium fancy brunch places.

One thing I wanted to say is that some things on the menu is spicy like the weekend special this time was jalapeno cornbread with egg, meat, and spicy bba sauce and another item was a spicy pork on the menu. I felt a bit limited in choices, but at the same time, I liked that they only had a set number of choices. This usually means these items are really good because it's their focus.

I would definitely come back for dinner. Btw: they can book weddings here three times a month. We inquired about a wedding for a friend. They can fit 120 people max and costs minimum of about $20,000 open bar with 4 courses and late night station. They can even make their famous pancakes for a late night station! I wish someone I know will have a wedding here soon time!"}
{"text":"The pancakes definitely did not disappoint. They were thick and fluffy but I would definitely recommend getting it as a side as there are a lot of other dishes worth trying as well (such as Veda's choice)

I'll definitely be back and I'll definitely always order a side pancakes."}
{"text":"We recently went to Mildred and enjoyed an excellent brunch in a big, bright room with lovely decorative details (I loved the giant painted mural near the 'lounge' and the wavy glass wall near the bar).

The order:

Veda's Choice - Mildred's version of eggs benny/florentine: two poached eggs covered in bearnaise sauce sandwiched inside a beautiful croissant, with your choice of rosemary bacon or smoked salmon (we chose bacon) and a side of greens in a lovely vinaigrette. ABSOLUTELY AWESOME DISH. Scrumptious to the last bite.

Mrs Biederhof's Legendary Blueberry Pancakes - a stack of three very thick, fluffy pancakes served with maple syrup, fresh blueberry compote and whipped cream. VERY good but--no disrespect to Mrs Biederhof--not as Earth-shatteringly good as the blueberry pancakes at School restaurant (also located in Liberty Village). But don't get me wrong, Biederhof's are still super yummy....they're just a wee bit dry for my tastes.

To drink we got a caesar (good but very spicy...I'd order it without Tabasco next time) and a lil pot of special Earl Gray which, as promised, had notes of caramel.

It's no wonder Mildred Temple is one of Toronto's brunch heavy-hitters. The food is extremely high quality and the service is fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"One of the most popular brunch places in Toronto. Almost always a one hour wait. There are some nice shops nearby (West Elm, EQ3) so you can put your name down and they'll text you. 

Make sure you try the famous blueberry pancakes (you can get a single one on the side if you don't want too much) and also make sure you get the toppings on the side. It tends to soak through and makes the pancake too sweet. 

The Veda's Choice is my favourite, their version of an eggs Benny but sandwiched between a super flaky, fresh croissant. Their salad is also great. The Rosemary potatoes are also very tasty if you won't think it's too heavy. 

I'd also recommend their Caesar and scones as a side/starter. The staff are always super friendly and have a great, fun attitude. A nice place to take friends from out of town or the special brunch every now and then."}
{"text":"Was here for a private event. Great location. Friendly staff. Great food and drink selection. Will coke back again. 

4.25/5 *"}
{"text":"There are some things about this place that are the negatives of a really successful restauraunt; long line ups and limited reservations. 

After waiting in the queue we had two of the regular favourites; blueberry pancakes and big brunch skillet, I wouldn't say the food is at all bad. In fact it was very flavorful, the pancakes were moist and big brunch skillet was pretty good. My only gripe was the lack of bang for your buck. The \"big brunch\" skillet was actually pretty small, and furthermore the portion size was equally small. The blueberry pancakes were quite proportionate for the price."}
{"text":"Great brunch place. Amazing blueberry pancakes stacked super high, delicious! Nice service, cute ambiance. Location was just a bit out of the way for me: in liberty village."}
{"text":"I've only been here for brunch but it is excellent. The scones are great, the service is great and the ambiance is too."}
{"text":"Despite this place being open for years and getting rave reviews for their brunch, I never made it a point to check it out until recently. 

My husband and I, with toddler in tow, decided to visit Mildred's for brunch on Family Day. We called ahead of time and found out they didn't take brunch reservations, so we arrived shortly after they opened and were seated immediately. Not only did they have a highchair for the toddler, they had ones with trays, which is exceedingly rare in this city but ever so useful.

The ambience was lovely and I appreciated that the tables weren't crammed too close together. Service was amazingly friendly and upbeat, stopping regularly to \"chat\" with our kid and offer her crayons, etc.

Coffee was decent, spicy Caesars very spicy (almost TOO spicy for me) and the food was delicious. I had the Huevos Monty (black beans and cheddar in tortillas, topped with eggs, salsa, guac and sour cream), which tasted great, though a little heavy on the sour cream (I just pushed it to the side). My husband had the Big Brunch Skillet (pulled pork with black bean and potato hash and eggs) which was also awesome. For the kiddo we were able to order a single buttermilk pancake with all the toppings for around $4. Probably should have gone for the full order as hubby and I may not have bogarted more than a little taste...

We did have to wait a little long for our food but they made it up to us by not charging for a take-away order of the currant scones (which were also delicious, especially with the apple preserves and whipped butter that came along side).

Definitely the best overall brunch experience I've had recently, so I highly recommend it and will return."}
{"text":"My girlfriend lives in the area so we have gone here pretty often. The Huveo Monty (sp) is delicious as are the blueberry pancakes. One piece of advice, however: perhaps have the pancake as a side, since 3 full pancakes as your only main may be a little much."}
{"text":"Yes, all the noise you hear about the pancakes are true. They are damn good and fluffy. It's hard to finish a full order, so I recommend ordering a smaller portion (which is an option). I relaly enjoyed Veda's choice and the scones. The one downside is that this place gets busy fast and the turn around is slower on the weekends because people like to enjoy their brunch at a relaxing pace so you could be waiting for 30 mins - 1.5 hrs for a table. If you've got time on your hands it's worth the wait but consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"Food was great, the only downside was only because of the absurd wait time we came on a Saturday at 9:30am and there was already a line to take names! Took about 20min to put our name down, and then another 29 to get seated. Once we were seated service was very good and food came quickly, perhaps it was so busy b/c it was Mother's Day weekend.
Food was delicious had the croissant eggs Benedict and blueberry pancakes
Salad was excellent and so were the potatoes, eggs benny cooked to perfection and the pancakes were very fluffy and delicious
Oh and best hot chocolate!!"}
{"text":"I so wanted this place to be better. It was my birthday and I ventured to try this place based on a passing glance of the menu when I was furniture shopping in Liberty Village one Sunday. This was my first mistake: not referencing Yelp first. My second mistake was bringing a group of friends who normally hold my resto reccos in high regard. Everything sounded so good from the menu descriptions; it unfortunately just did not deliver on them."}
{"text":"Even with the changes, Mildred's is still the highest end restaurant in liberty village.  The lunch is still brunchy and I don't care for pancakes of any kind, but the soups are fresh and good and their steak and burger is also great.  The ambiance is probably the nicest of any LV restaurants. Open kitchen is a plus and still cheaper and better value than School. Avoid the popular times so you don't have to wait in line with a bunch of wannabe hipsters."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast amd were hungry so got 3 dishes. The first 2 (Huevos Monty Mildred's take on huevos rancheros; and Veda's Choice, which was poached eggs and salmon) left us a bit worried. They were ok but pretty much what you'd expect for something that cost $15. So did we make the trek all the way here for nothing?

Then we ended with the pancakes, and that definitely saved the day. For all the hype, the pancakes definitely lived up to heightened expectations. If you're looking for a traditional fluffy ones, maybe these aren't for you. But if you're fine with a slightly different (and definitely yummier) take on a pancake, go for it! It tasted like a cross between a pancake and a scone, with just the right blend of fluffy/\"crusty\", with the generous toppings of blueberries, cream and maple syrup perfectly complementing it. Oh and they were definitely generous - you can ask for more toppings if you want!"}
{"text":"Got here around 9am on a Sunday morning so we didn't have to wait. Loved the fluffy and enormous  blueberry pancakes. Tasted like giant scones - I could only finish two and had to pack the third! Whipped cream is so good when paired with the light syrup. Great atmosphere, lots of light and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great food in a pretty amazing space.  We met a buddy who works right nearby, right in the middle of lunch.  I was told these were the only good burgers in Toronto and this place didn't disappoint. 

Again, really beautiful space to eat in, lovely presentation for the burger, and the garlic aioli dipping sauce was pretty amazing as well.  

This place is a bit of a hike out of downtown, we walked all the way from Spadina down King Street but it was worth the walk, if you find yourself in this area, give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Mildred's Temple

So our group had a reservation for Mildred's Temple and we were waiting for our table. This place is always busy on a Sunday afternoon. We expected a wait but I couldn't stand it after half an hour. I was hungry and hungover. As a result of that I was fidgety and my stomach was devouring itself. I went to the washroom to kill some time. One unique thing to mention right off the bat is the unisex washrooms that play the Air Canada announcements and Emergency Evacuation procedures. I thought to myself, what in the world is going on? Am I hallucinating from hunger? I really tripped out. After waiting another half an hour (over an hour wait in total) they gave us complementary Biscuits and Scones. They were the best biscuits I've ever had. It could have been biased as I was famished beyond belief. 

I ordered Veda's Choice which was Poached eggs in a Croissant with the option of Bacon or Smoked Salmon. I opted for the healthier option and chose the Smoked Salmon. Our server suggested to me half fries and half salad as my side option. The only thing he failed to mention was that there was a $1 charge to do so. Once I got my dish I inhaled it and it was amazing. I almost forgot what a fork and a knife was. Yes, I used my hands for everything except the Salad. #Savage maybe? Then I got to the Blueberry Pancake and I literally felt like I was in heaven. It instantly changed the way I thought about this place from being Hangry. I would recommend this place, but avoid coming in big groups so you don't have to wait as long as I did. JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"-Waiter was inattentive, and service overall was a complete failure. They stumbled about, spilling stuff, wrongly guessing who had what, and couldn't answer basic questions.
-No host at the front door for 5 mins (felt like eternity)
-Water was constantly empty
-The bathroom was disgusting
-The website is all Flash, doesn't work on iPhone.

-Jerk Lamb with spicy Jicama slaw was fantastic. Perfectly cooked with crackling on each piece, a delicate and delicious crunch with every tender bite of lamb. Highlight dish of the evening. Everyone else at the table said their dinner was only OK, so I must have had the best of it.

-Curried Calamari and spring onion was awful. Overcooked, very chewy. All I could smell was char, any opportunity for subtlety in the curry was lost long before the sauce hit the plate.

-Dessert is very good."}
{"text":"Had brunch on Saturday morning and really enjoyed the service, modern ambiance and delicious food offered at Mildred's. When we arrived, we were seated right away with menus. We were concerned about the line up so we came for 9am but by the time we left (around 10am) there was still no line up. We ordered the scones to start and they were buttery and warm. Their jam and whipped butter were a perfect compliment to the buttery scone. When it came to mains, I ordered Veda's choice. The salmon and croissant combination with b√©arnaise sauce was decadent. My partner ordered the manhandler and I tried a piece of their flank steak and BBQ sauce - it was perfectly seasoned. The meat was very flavourful on it's on!  Our server was also attentive and came to refill our coffee twice. But what I loved most about our brunch was seeing different groups of people come together to enjoy a meal - there were families, groups of friends, couples and travellers. I always find that a good sign that the restaurant is able to cater to many crowds. Would love to come back to try their evening menu!"}
{"text":"The service here is subpar.  Slow service even when the whole restaurant was empty.  Ultimately had an \"ok\" experience since the food was somewhat good.  I had the blueberry pancakes and they were good too but besides that, the price and service do not make this place worthy of a return."}
{"text":"The brunch was great! Very well made with care.   I finished me eggs beni iff with the blueberry pancakes.  So fluffy and light.  Perfect finish!"}
{"text":"Everything was great, except the wait! We were told an hour, which turned into an hour and a half. No big deal, but don't go here for brunch if you're in a rush, as there are no reservations and it's very popular. We arrived at 1045, you might do better arriving earlier.

I enjoyed my meal (the pulled pork skillet) and my table-mates had good things to say about theirs, as well as the Caesar and the coffee/tea. Worth checking out if you're in the area and have time to kill."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekend for brunch with a reservation for a party of 6. They will not put you down to be seated until the whole party has arrived. This place can get really busy.

I had the Big Brunch Skillet, which was hearty, filling and tasty. There's a good mix of the ingredients, and if you can take heat, they have a great hot sauce that you can ask for.

The 6 of us also got 2 orders of the pancakes to share (each order having 3) so that everyone could try one. These were honestly the best pancakes I've ever had; they're thick, fluffy, and are topped generously. Definitely give these a try.

Will try to return for some of the other items!"}
{"text":"There are plenty of people who lack appreciation for the finer things in life, as demonstrated by finding a restaurant like Mildred's Temple Kitchen with a 3.5 out of 5 star rating (as of this writing).  You know, they're the kind of dimwits who complain about the speed of service when they're at a relaxing & elegant restaurant.

Mildred's menu isn't the biggest or broadest, but what they make tastes amazing.

Their portions are far from big - at first glance I thought some were small - however, the quantities are perfectly satisfying for someone who's not an overweight glutton.

A true gourmet burger can be found at Mildred's, and it should be the benchmark for all competing gourmet burgers.

People who don't love Mildred's are probably better off eating at Harvey's or McDonalds...

Sorry if I come off arrogant or condescending, but some of the reviewers here need to get a clue.  I may write more later, as I love Mildred's Temple Kitchen and go there periodically.  It's one of my favourite places to take visitors."}
{"text":"Came for brunch. The service was lovely and accommodating. We didn't have to wait very long at all. The menu wasn't too extensive so if you are looking for a lot of choices this isn't the top of your list. The food was delicious. I can't find the word for it but the place just wasn't overwhelming in any way that would push me to give it 5 stars. Overall it was satisfying and lovely but not mind-blasting."}
{"text":"MTK did not disappoint. The blueberry pancakes looked and tasted great. The service was phenom considering most places this busy try and turn tables as quickly as possible. Our server floated by exactly when that extra bit of syrup was needed for the pancakes. What really surprised us was the flat iron steak and eggs aka \"the man handler\" which was spiced and cooked to perfection. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The wait was loooong....An hour or more. 

I ordered a Goat Cheese tart (or something like that) with salad and a side of Blueberry Pancake becaise I was told that I would not be able to finish 3 Pancakes. Hogwash!

The pancake was delicious as was the savoury Tart. Flaky and Fresh. 
I have to go back for the Pancakes now.

May 20, 2018

Finally made it. And had the Pancakes only. Nom Nom Nom Nom!

The wait was still an hour :( That would be the only deterrent for me. I think people who live close by walk over and put their names on the list quicker than everyone else in the City. Sigh."}
{"text":"Place is overrated. Food is OK but you feel as they are trying to rush you out the door the moment you sit down (after waiting for over 50 mins for a table). Went for brunch with girlfriends and I had the special - just ok. Would spend this money in a place with better service."}
{"text":"Good food but this place can't handle the logistics of a brunch crowd. Tables remain uncleared for ten minutes after people leave."}
{"text":"Went here for the prix fixe brunch and had smoked salmon eggs benny which came with oj and scones all for the bargain basement price of $27.50 each, coffee extra.  If the food tasted better than any eggs benny I'd ever tried before, I'd say it was worth every nickel, but it didn't so it's not. It tasted good, but wasn't great. IOW, MTK is A-OK."}
{"text":"Great menu, funky space with a hip vibe.  Love this place"}
{"text":"The most amazing brunch spot I have ever been to! Atmosphere, theme and food was outstanding!"}
{"text":"I came to Mildred's Temple Kitchen last Saturday for a brunch with some friends. Despite of the place being so busy, food impressively came out fast. I ordered the Big Brunch Skillet.

Big brunch skillet interestingly came with an actual skillet. Presentation wise it was a plus. The food itself was quite good, though not the best. The combination of pulled pork and salsa sauce was good, but I'm personally not sure if the egg adds value to the whole thing unless it's running - which it wasn't. I hope there is another chance to visit and try another dish."}
{"text":"Went for weekend brunch.  Had the biscuits and the scones and immediately ordered six to go (they go quickly on weekends, for good reason!)  They are the best I've ever eaten!  Buttery, flakey, delicious.. and paired with homemade apple butter.  I had the eggs Benedict with salmon and side house salad, all perfect.   My husband had steak and eggs.  It was hard to pick which was better.

Best brunch I've had in a long time, already thinking of when I can go back!

The restaurant itself is beautiful inside, a large wall of window and an airy feel to the interior,  open kitchen and nice bar.  Would be great to book for a function."}
{"text":"** Review for Winterlicious Dinner $38 **

The Winterlicious special features a $38 3-course prix fixe menu, in which you get to pick appetizer, entree, and dessert from a selection of 3 to 4 items each. When we were at the restaurant we were only offered the Winterlicious menu on the table along with the drink menu, so it is possible that they only served Winterlicious items during this period.  

Environment:
The restaurant had a large, loft-style space with some nice and modern decor. It felt really warm and cozy, due to both the decor and the fact that they turned the heat up quite high, which was great for the winter season. Even though they had a lot of space, they didn't try cram the restaurant with too many tables, so it didn't feel overly loud at the open concept restaurant. On the stage there was an open kitchen where you can watch as they prepare your meal, the smell of the kitchen didn't spread to the seating area, which was nice. 

Food:
In our group we tried to select everything from the Winterlicious menu, with the exception of the appetizer which we unanimously chose the crab cakes, and for the entree we took a pass on the vegetarian cauliflower dish. 
-- During the Winterlicious dinner they also offered $1 oysters so we decided to order half a dozen to try. The oysters tasted great, they were fresh with very little little fishy taste. 
-- We each received a complimentary Cheddar Biscuit to start, which kind of reminded me of the Red Lobster biscuit. The biscuit came with light whipped butter to spread and it tasted really great, but I think personally I still prefer the stronger flavour of the Red Lobster biscuits more. 
-- The Shrimp and Crab cake tasted great, and I was a huge fan of the sweet and sour sauce, because it really complimented the crab cakes and opened up my appetite for more food. The crab cakes were really crispy and it definitely tasted like it was made fresh from the kitchen.
-- I got the Duck & Waffle for main and to be honest I was slightly disappointed. The meal felt like it's been sitting in the kitchen for a while before they served it to us because the waffle was too soggy, but the duck was good though. I saw that some of the tables had a duck egg on top of the exact same dish but mine didn't, but when I asked for it they told me that I didn't inform them I wanted an egg on top when I placed my order (???). I double checked the menu and nowhere did it mention anything about the duck egg, so I'm not sure it's supposed to be a secret menu item or others had paid extra for the egg, but either way I didn't like how they handled my question. 
-- The orders got the Beef Short Rib and the Cod. I think the beef short rib was the best deal out of the bunch because the portion was gigantic and my friend told me it was really tender and flavourful. However, the dish was quite greasy due to the fat on the short rib but apparently that was the best part. The piece of fish that you get in the cod dish was quite small but I was told that the sauce was really good and it complimented the dish. 
-- I got the White Chocolate Cheesecake for dessert. It tasted like a regular piece of cheesecake, but I certainly didn't taste the white chocolate in it. I did like the red wine cranberry sauce drizzled on top.
-- The others got the churro and the Apple Crumble. The Churros were really good as well and it was shareable because it came with 5 to 6 sticks of churros. I liked how rich the chocolate dipping sauce was and the tiny spice gave the sauce some kick. I didn't get a taste of the apple crumble but I think my friend enjoyed it. 

Service:
Our server Nicole was really really charming and attentive, as she checked up on us many times and we had a great time interacting with her. She would also periodically come by to add water to our cups.

Overall, I think the meal was great and it was definitely really full after my meal. However, I don't think my personally is willing to spend $38 on it given that I also had great experiences trying out $28 price point Winterlicious dinners. I am tempted to come back again to try their famous pancakes, which are only served during brunch hours."}
{"text":"So I actually visited Mildred's Temple Kitchen a few years ago to try their much-lauded pancakes, and indeed, they are super delicious (and quite photo friendly). I attempted to return last summer, but the place was ridiculously packed. When my dining companion, desperate to try those pancakes, suggested a visit on a recent weekday, I jumped at the chance.

We arrived around 1:00 and the place, predictably, was very crowded. And although the patio was a no-go, we quickly managed to secure a spot deep within the restaurant.

We ordered our food and then waited. And waited some more. I should note, too, that I had a perfect view of the pass and noticed a plate of pancakes sitting there for a very, very long time. It was about 15 minutes between it being left there to the dish being served, which is nothing short of ludicrous. I was definitely relieved when it went to a different table.

I did, however, notice a plate that looked suspiciously like what I had ordered sitting there for almost 10 minutes while my dining companion's pancakes were being prepared. And indeed, I did eventually receive that plate of food. (I was just thankful I didn't order anything that needed to be served hot.)

Anyway, I wound up getting the Chicken Avocado Club (\"grilled chicken breast sandwiched between two slices of toasted sourdough, slathered with bacon jam, avocado smash & garlic aioli, layered with fresh tomato & lettuce\") with mixed greens.

It's a decent sandwich. The huge chunks of chicken are a little dry, though, and they kept falling out of the sandwich because they're so big. The various condiments and accompaniments work pretty well together, although the entire bottom of the sandwich was pretty soggy (which was no doubt a result of it having sat there for way too long).

I did try a few bites of my dining companion's pancakes and they were delicious as ever. It makes me wonder if the restaurant is even interested in putting the care they put into those Instagram-friendly 'cakes into the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"I came here with two friends a while back, and we got a few things. The croissant breakfast sandwich and the smoked salmon salad were decent, but the blueberry buttermilk pancakes really stood out. It's also cute in there. I just wish they took reservations."}
{"text":"Such a lovely brunch spot, however the lineups are brutal. The croissants are insanely delicious."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm yummy. You can't go wrong with Mildred's Temple Kitchen - trust me, the long wait is worth it! We went a few weeks ago and it was sooo good! Most of my friends had the waffles (a must have) and I had the huevos rancheros which were absolutely delicious! We weren't in the mood for mimosas, but the lemonades and juices they had were awesome. Service was amazing and they all were so funny and nice! Would definitely recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Mildred's Temple is my staple \"go to\" restaurant in Liberty. 

I absolutely love this place, yes for the food and the decor.. yada yada..

But honestly, it's the constancy that I am in awe of.   Every single time I have been there I'm always greeted by friendly servers and bar staff with big smiles.  And the food is a knock out of the park every time.   

I love their brunch especially.   I absolutely recommend the scones and/or the huevos monty (I think they put the Rob Ford special in the recipe or something, because these scones are addictive)...

Anyhow, this place is amazing and delicious.. Enough said."}
{"text":"My Orders: Blueberry pancakes (surprisingly not too sweet, delish), Vedas choice (not bad minus the sauce), Big Brunch Skillet (flavorful)

Pros 
+ Ambiance 
+ Location: it's close to the hwy. 
+ Parking: not bad if you come early. Free street parking on Sunday before 1pm. 
+ W/R: Interesting. Unisex stalls with airline announcements. That definitely stood out for me. 

Cons 
- No RSVPS: We arrived at 11 and had a 45 min wait. We expected as much. I liked that they had the option to text us when our table was ready. 
- Patio Closed: While I understand this, I feel like they could've just bought a few space heaters and kept this area open. It would've reduced the wait.
-  Service: Slow. We were probably seated for nearly half an hour before we could order and waited another half hour for our food. I feel like I would've been in and out of any other restaurant in 1 hr but I spent a good 2 here."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner! The amount of food on each entree is more than enough to make you full. I got the striploin steak and they cooked medium rare perfectly. It was so tender! Their fries were delicious as well - perfectly crisp! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great vibe and staff! Checked it out today for the first time for a biz lunch meet up. Cute, cosy yet sophisticated.. love that! 
The food and drink was really good too - got the Veda (2 poached eggs on a butter croissant) with salmon, along with side of salad. Got both sauce and dressing on the side! Also tried their hot chocolate with almond milk, and it was such a yummy treat! Tends to get busy around noon, so glad I reserved on OpenTable the night before. Really cute patio too - would love to come back in the spring time as well."}
{"text":"SIX STARS. SIX!

So, we had our wedding reception here. This is going to a long, rambling review, and targeted more for those who might consider this space for weddings or private events. We dealt primarily with Justine, MTK's event co-ordinator. She's leaving though, so I'm going to try to leave Justine out of this. As such, I think I'll skip all the preparation that went on (initial meeting, tasting, more meetings, lots of emails), and go straight to the big event.

The newly-minted wife and I arrived near the end of cocktail hour with the place fully-abuzz. Mildred's was chosen in no small part due to its ambiance and decor - truly, it's a lovely venue. Drinks were flowing, the monstrous cheese table was out and under assault, and the hors d'oeuvres were in strong circulation. We selected four from a larger offering: (1) cauliflower pakora; (2) sliders; (3) perogies; (4) steak frites. I think they were all solid choices, overall well-rounded, and gd delicious. The guests said they liked it, but what else are they going to say at my wedding?

On to the meal:

(1) roasted corn & coconut soup
(2) ricotta gnudi with nutmeg tossed in sage butter with shaved Sovrano  
(3a) striploin steak with mashed potatoes, horseradish jus & kale
(3b) pan-seared Atlantic salmon with crunchy potato pillows, pickled ramps & sauce gribiche
(3c) roast curried cauliflower tossed with quinoa, caramelized onion, wilted spinach & green grapes
(4) Mildred's famous profiteroles

Each and every piece a knock-out. Sure I'm biased, but really during the tasting I was in heaven. I will say that even family known to be critical were singing Mildred's praises that night. 

Wait staff was phenomenal, and I was blown away by the sheet amount of manpower they threw at this event. Our server Maya was killer, and made the evening that much better. She even kept the bride fed - no easy task. In addition, the event co-ordinator and restaurant manager were on all hand to ensure the evening went smoothly. Out of the three: (1) venue, (2) food, (3) service; it's hard to say what was better. A triumvirate success, I think. Almost all of the staff were there to the bitter end too, and some even made it out to the dance floor.

I'll try to be somewhat objective though, despite it being my wedding. A couple cons: the steak frites hors d'oeuvre was not as advertised. At the sampling, it was a generous hunk of meat on a singular, thick frite. What was served was more like a poutine with a thin strip of meat adorned on top. Still good, but not as great. 

Next, the toilets. What the hell, the toilets. The setup here is a connecting hallway with four separate rooms branching off. The toilets work on an automated sensor to flush. Unfortunately, the sensor only goes off once you've completely exited the room, leaving some to worry that their business wasn't properly being taken care of. Further, it wouldn't flush if the seat was left up. Kinda confusing, kinda silly.

But really, that's it. Logistically, things were solid. The minimum spend for the resto was reasonable, booze was based on consumption and came in lower than estimated (despite our best attempts), and they were very accommodating with respect to our various wedding knick knacks, decorations, flowers, etc.

A fantastic evening, and Mildred's made a lot of fans that evening. Good work.

Note: the underground parking lot directly under MTK is mad expensive. Like bonkers. However, less than five minutes walk south is a Green P lot that on weekends and holidays is $3 all day. Can't fucking beat that!"}
{"text":"Mildred's is a great brunch spot.  The menu is straight forward thought somewhat limited.  Last time I went, I had the pork skillet and it was fantastic.  The big downer is the wait - we were told 30 min and ended up waiting over an hour.  The food was good but definitely not worth the hour wait.

Cool decor!"}
{"text":"Came here last Thursday morning for brunch. I made a reservation on Open Table, and was able to get seated right away.

It's situated in Liberty Village, and the decor inside is gorgeous. It's very minimal/streamlined, and suits the location very well. 

I like that you can see the chefs creating their magic right in the open. 

We ordered the breakfast skillets, the chicken avocado club, and the famous blueberry pancakes. Everything was made to perfection. 

The skillets had the right amount of flavour, and were very filling. The club is made with egg bread i believe, and the chicken breast is probably one of the best i've ever tasted, super soft. 

Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Beautiful brunch place. Had the fresh scones and buttermilk biscuit which was tasty and I had the blueberry pancakes which were so good but very dense and fills you up fast. They have the option of ordering just one pancake which I would do next time. Definitely worth a visit if in the area!"}
{"text":"Came to Mildred's Temple Kitchen for brunch on a fine Saturday morning. It was the weekend following the summer's humid streak of weather, and after a heavy thunderstorm the night before - so the weather could only have been described as perfect.

Table for two please.

The patio was rather busy so we chose a seat inside the restaurant. I appreciated how open and spacious the dining area was, with floor to ceiling windows to bring in the light too. We had arrived at just the right time (~10:30) since there was still seating inside (by the time we left at around 11:30, there was quite a queue of pairs/couples waiting for tables).

Food:

Scone & Biscuit: We ordered one of each. Both looked delicious - the biscuit was nice and flaky; the scone was soft with dried black currants and lemon zest baked in. 

Veda's Choice: Poached eggs with bacon on a croissant, with a side of greens. I enjoyed the runny eggs and the B√©arnaise sauce. The croissant was flaky and absorbed the runny eggs well. 

Mildred's Flakey Savoury Tart: Stole a bite of my girlfriend's dish. The tart was light but eggy - like a quiche.


Overall, a delicious brunch to start the weekend off right. I will be sure to make a trip back to Mildred's Temple Kitchen and Liberty Village."}
{"text":"The good: the blueberry pancake here was hyped up by everyone I know that has been here, and boy do they live up to their name! One of the best, if not, the best pancake I have had in Toronto! I also ordered the big brunch skillet, which believe it or not, I prefer more than the pancake! It's not as 'spicy' I would have wanted, but the pulled pork was so juicy and moist and the piri piri salsa pairs well together with the dish. The portion sizes are just right - I was planning to order the pancake as just an appetizer dish, but trust me, you will be filled with just ordering it as a main dish.

The bad: no reservation for Sunday brunch which leads to...

The ugly: the wait times here is horrendous. 1hr and 20min for a table.... The question is, is the food worth the wait?

Neutral: it's a nice area to walk around while you wait for a table. Best suited for couples or two people hangout. The bigger the group, the longer the wait."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to checkout Mildred's after hearing great reviews from friends. Our first mistake was not making a reservation ahead of time. The wait time was over 1.5 hrs but we decided to wait it out. Would definitely recommend you get a reservation ahead of time to avoid the long wait.

We were seated at a table near the large windows which was very nice and let in a lot of natural light. The interior has very high ceilings and nice, simple decor. 

We ordered two dishes to share and the food was overall quite good and didn't disappoint:

Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes ($16) - I was super excited to try their famous pancakes and they definitely lived up to the hype. These pancakes were incredibly fluffy and light, paired with a delicious blueberry compote and maple syrup

Big Brunch Skillet ($14.50) - this was a pulled pork dish with eggs, hash, beans and salsa. I felt it was a little salty but overall very good as well

This is a fantastic brunch spot, beautiful decor with good food. Would definitely recommend getting their pancakes, definitely worth all the buzz!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Had it for the first time today and I was blown away! The Pancakes are AMAZING! All the sides look so good, I got the Chorizo sausage...TWICE! If you're ever in Liberty Village this place is a must!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday for a late lunch with my friend. It was pretty empty, but service was still glacially slow. 

I ordered the grilled cheese (but I will be coming back for the pancakes). My friend ordered the pancakes, but without the blueberries. 

The grilled cheese was really good, but a little too oily (buttery) which makes it delicious, but very heavy even though I got it with a salad. 

My friend said the pancakes were delicious and they came as a huge stack, so she asked for some extra syrup. She even took one to go. 

Overall, if you avoid drinking, it's not too expensive."}
{"text":"I try to keep an open mind with restaurants but this was a total let-down. 

The service was friendly and fast but the food near horrible. There were 4 of us and the Saffron Curried Chicken was very different than what I'm used to, it was 3 pieces of deep friend chicken in curry flavour. The pork chop was 70% fat with little real meat. The dessert was the only redeeming course. 

For 70$/head (tax and tip included) of 3 courses each and a drink, I saw little value."}
{"text":"How have I not written a review for one of my favourite restaurants of all time?  My bf and I are very loyal brunchies here and we set out on a mission to do groceries, buy dog treats, look at kitchen ware, etc. while we wait for that hour.  

Mildred's is definitely extremely busy in the morning on the weekends because everrryone goes to them.  We've tried nearby places and they're not nearly as good as Mildred's.  Their pancakes are definitely worth the hype but their other brunch items are fantastic as well.  They are also dog friendly and will let you tie your dog outside the patio during the summer when it doesn't rain.  LadyBug, our spoiled pug, loves going there and loves eating their pancakes as well (as well as their venison...more on that later). 

In addition to brunch, we've also gone to Mildred's for Winterlicious this past year and a Visa Infinite Dining Series soiree.  While I was not a huge fan of my brisket (and would have much preferred to order the duck confit - *never* listening to the boyfriend again about ordering different items #iwantwhatiwant), everything else was delicious nevertheless.  The Visa Infinite Dining Series was also a fantastic night.  It really was a longgggg night (we were there until 11:30 and we finally decided it was a weekday and it was time to go to cuddle the dog), but it was a fantastic one.  I really wish their Infinite Dining Series fell on a weekend - so that could be a suggestion for the future.  That said, the population of people who went to this dining series were older adults who clearly were retired and free from their duties of ...hmm employment.  

Overall, we love Mildred's Kitchen dearly and we would come back here any time.  Brunch is worth the hype..just be prepared to wait.  Don't go super hungry...have a little bit of something because you will be waiting and the last thing we need is a negative hangry Nancy to be writing a Yelp review :)."}
{"text":"Truly exceptional food.  The atmosphere is very....umm cold(lots of cement structural pillars but that really is the look they were going for.  I was extremely pleased with the service and food and i would go back in a minute."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! Must go for the famous blueberry pancakes. Also the ambience place is cool! We initially tried going on a Sunday and ended up being turned away because the wait was so long and they were close to closing...but that didn't stop us from coming back on Monday. No wait on a Monday at noon. Quick service and everything was so tasty!"}
{"text":"Solid a** spot! First off, Canadians are incredibly nice people, for the most part, so our server was no departure from that. The restaurant was immaculately clean & the decor was very nice. 

The pancakes the pancakes the pancakes! Some of the best innovative pancakes I've ever had. Can't wait to visit next month & have them again!"}
{"text":"Very bumpin', large, and creative brunch spot! I am definitely a fan after only one visit.

I ordered their blueberry pancakes, which were nice and fluffy and flavourful. Could have used more berry compote and whipped cream for that many pancakes though. I would recommend ordering a side of those on top, although you may not even have room to finish if you're like me and everyone else I watch eat them. They weren't the best pancakes I've ever had, but they were decent. The side of rosemary bacon is a must for this dish according to the bartender who served me and I have to agree. In fact, the bacon was even more impressive than the pancakes so order a side of them no matter what your main.

Overall definitely worth the trip to Liberty Village, which is a pretty chill and neat suburb to wander when you get the chance."}
{"text":"I'm a fan, but only of the blueberry pancakes. Came here a while back and recall an extremely long wait (almost 1 hr). The set up of the restaurant is classy and service definitely came in at that level as well. As for food, I recall everything more or less just being ok except for the pancakes. These ARE worth coming to this restaurant. I'm not a pancakes guy but I think they are the best I've ever had. I'd come back just for that."}
{"text":"Brunch and I have a complicated relationship.  I've had way more misses than hits in the past, so waiting an hour in line for Mildred's was not something I would've been willing to do had my friends not insisted.  You should know that this is not a place to go if patience is not your strong suit or if you're ever so slightly tight on time.  As if the hour wait to go sit inside the resto wasn't enough, it took almost another hour for our food to come.  The terrible wait and inattentive service is what brought down my original 5 stars.

5 stars for the food because it was absolutely delicious.  After trying a few well-known brunch spots on the west coast, Mildred's still remains my favourite.

Grape juice to start to quench my thirst and growing hunger; fresh, not enough, but delish.
- Veda's Choice:  Had to get this classic at Mildred's. Poached eggs on a flakey croissant and I got it with smoked salmon; the Bearnaise sauce tasted amazing with the salmon and croissant; this twist on egg benny is just perfect.  Mixed greens are there for show, but who cares.
- Mrs. Biederhof's Legendary Light & Fluffy Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes:  Mrs. Beiderhof, if you were my grandmother I would've been one fat child.  It's so rare to have pancakes so fluffy yet light at the same time, I usually hate whipped cream but with these pancakes everything just tasted absolutely perfect.  

Would I go back?  Hell yes, for their scones and tart and to have my Veda's again and again.  

Decor is quite modern and hipster, I love how open the resto feel and the fact that you can see some of the food being made in the open kitchen.  But really Mildred's, please hire more servers or have them be equally attentive to the customers who are racking up the alcohol bill at a bachelorette brunch (yeah, we just had to sit next to one).  We are people too :("}
{"text":"Very classy and elegant decor and absolutely delicious brunch. Their portions were huge and very filling. Ordered the eggs Benedict with avocado and loved it. Super friendly service but the waiting line was wayyy too long."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for a really long time since I heard this place is known for their pancakes.  The pancakes were made out of buttermilk and a bluberry sauce compote with whipped cream. One is big enough for two people. The pancakes melt in your mouth. If I come here again I will probably order the pancakes again since I liked it so much. Very spacious restaurnat and packed"}
{"text":"The food here is great, and the portion sizes are not too big which is nice. I've had the Huevos Rancheros, the tart, and the blueberry pancakes. All of them were delicious. The tart I had was essentially a cheese and mushroom quiche. It was probably the best quiche I've ever had; the cheese was melty and the egg was still a little runny, yum.

I like that they have you sit at the bar/lounge area so you can read magazines and have coffee/tea while you wait for your table.

I also like the decor and that it is very spacious.

The only complaint I have is that the hostess wasn't very nice, and for no particular reason."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Came for Winterlicious after hearing good things. Right off the bat I was really impressed with the decor. It was a large space and didn't feel crowded even though it was fairly full. 

I started off with the duck rillettes with house made bread, pickles, grainy mustard and onion jam. This was my first time trying onion jam and I feel like I can eat it with anything. I really liked the dish. I personally would have liked the bread to be toasted or grilled only because it would have been easier to spread the rillette onto it if it was stiffer. 

My girlfriend ordered the green tea cured trout with yuzu compressed apple, shaved fennel & winter radishes. It also was REALLY good. I thought the yuzu compressed Apple was out of this world. 

For the second course I had the braised veal cheek served on creamy herbed polenta & roasted garlic kale.The veal cheeks were melt in your mouth and fork tender. It was a simple dish done really well. 

For dessert I had the nutella semifreddo with maple-bourbon syrup, chantilly cream & hazelnut biscotti crumble. It was the highlight of my night. 

The service was exceptional. I can tell that the waitress was genuinely nice. After she realized that my girlfriend didn't really enjoy the dessert she recommended, she went above and beyond by bringing out another dessert for her. 

I would definitely recommend Mildred's temple kitchen and am looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Came here recently with a Groupon for a 4 course dinner for two and was really impressed! It was a set menu with no choice. Sometimes Groupon deals are like Winter/Summerlicious -- they end up being disappointing and the restaurant doesn't put their best offerings on it. Luckily, that was not the case here and I left thinking I would totally come back for brunch or another dinner (which, I guess is the point of Groupons and other deals). 

We started with a creamy corn soup with big chunks of lobster. The portion was pretty big and the soup was hearty, with a nice spiciness to it. Next was a sharing plate of ricotta gnudi. This was incredibly delicious! I love cheese and the texture was just right - melt-in-your-mouth. The main course was chicken (deboned, thankfully) served with veggies over a panzanella salad. The chicken was juicy and cooked to perfection, while the skin was crisp and full of flavour. It was a LOT of food though, we could barely finish. The dessert was a chocolate ice cream affogato (served with a shot of hot espresso).

Cocktails were delicious and interesting. I had a sweet white wine sangria. My DC had a cocktail recommended by our server (forgot the name, but it's 1st on the menu) -- it was spicy! 

I also love the decor. Minimalist and clean, high ceilings, with a nice bar area/lounge at the front (think sofas with lots of cushions, shelves of art books). There is a small patio area too. Service was unhurried and attentive. I have a new Liberty Village fave!"}
{"text":"I loved the staff, ambiance, presentation, drinks (added touches like shaved celery in the Caesar) and food. Must try the breakfast biscuit with whipped butter and in house made jam, blueberry pancake (that's coming from someone who dislikes pancakes). It's a must try for brunch! Highly recommend for brunch. 

We tried their dinner and for a Friday night it was quiet, and we know why.. Overall not that impressed. Tried the grilled calamari, mushroom skillet and beet salad, nothing really blew us away.. But I would still go back for brunch :)"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try the famous pancakes from Mildred's and it didn't disappoint. They're fluffy, sweet and the whipped creme gives a great touch. We ended up waiting for 30 minutes but it wasn't too long of a wait."}
{"text":"Tried the pancakes during their winterlicious menu and I fell in love. The pancake literally melted in my mouth! Great service and great location in Liberty village."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with my husband and it's always been worth the 40 mins to 1 hour wait on weekends. One of my fave brunch places for sure! My favourite thing on the menu is the blueberry pancakes (melt in your mouth goodness!) and my husband likes the big brunch skillet, which is savoury. The pancakes are enough for 2 people and the big brunch skillet portion is perfect for someone who's really hungry. The scones and biscuits are also delicious. Everything is always filling and fresh. The only other downside (aside from the long wait times) is that it can get pricey for brunch depending on what you order, especially if you like trying a few items. A must try place for brunch though!"}
{"text":"Event night last night with a few associates. 
Food was great. Had a blast. Great venue for events and private functions. Parking underground and on the streets.

Staff were great, the chef did a nice spread with the cheese board, and apps that were served. 

The place was perfect for our event."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spots in the area with great food, drinks, service and a very nice atmosphere. Also, best pancakes in town! So fluffy, moist, flavourful... perfect! 

Love this spot, the only reason this isn't a 5/5 is because the wait is crazy on weekends and they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Hard to find a better stack of pancakes anywhere else in the city! Went here with a few friends, and all of us have such an incredible time.

From the service to the food (especially those pancakes), the meal was an absolute pleasure. I can't wait to go back again and would recommend this place to anyone looking for the perfect brunch experience!"}
{"text":"Pros: 
Weekend brunch is awesome. Staff are friendly. Food is delicious. The blueberry pancakes are worth getting fat for.

Cons:
Long waiting time for food to come out. Hence contributes to the crazy long wait time to get a seat."}
{"text":"My first time at Mildred's Temple Kitchen in Liberty Village and I was immediately impressed by the ambience and the attentiveness of the staff. The noise level was perfect, great for groups, catching up with friends or impressing a date!

My friend and I were seated at the bar as the restaurant was completely full (went Dec 23, busy season for brunch). 

I ordered the Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes with maple syrup and whipped cream. It was absolutely delicious (really it was a dessert). It was delicious, fluffy and definitely satisfied my sweet tooth craving. 

I would love to come back again and try their other brunch items."}
{"text":"MTK is definitely one of the best brunch spots in the city. As much as I hate 1) waiting & 2) waking up early on weekends, Mildred's is definitely the exception.

As the other reviewers have said, the pancakes are effing amazing. But the real reason I keep coming back is for Veda's Choice, the eggs benny on a croissant. It's probably one of the best eggs Benedict I've ever had. 

5 stars for the great food, which is always consistent & delicious. 5 starts for the decor, layout & even the random music in the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Like many others, I came here for the famous thick blueberry buttermilk pancakes.  I came at almost 1 pm thinking that it might be a little less busy, but there was still a 45 minute wait for a party of 2.  I stuck it out because I've heard some mighty fine things about their blueberry pancakes.  We ended up waiting just shy of 1 hour to be seated.

Service was excellent.  The restaurant is beautiful and has a really cool and hip ambiance.  I ordered the blueberry pancakes, of course, and a black tea.  Is it the best blueberry pancakes I've ever had?  Yes, no doubt.  Was it worth the wait and the price?  No.  I think it's overly hyped.

It's $16.50 for the pancakes, and $4.35 for the plain earl grey tea.  I felt unsatisfied eating just pancakes for breakfast, but I couldn't order two items because of the portion size of the pancakes, and also the price point.  My friend had the breakfast skillet (the only item that had meat in it), and the portion size seemed quite small. 

The restaurant is fantastic, don't get me wrong, and I think the owners are doing everything right.  Honestly, if I were them, I'd keep overcharging for brunch too, why not because people keep swarming the place.  Good on them, but my personal opinion is that this restaurant is overrated."}
{"text":"In hot pursuit of Toronto's best pancakes, I read the Yelp reviews and decided to give Mildred's Temple Kitchen a go. The service was impeccable and I opted in for a side of bacon. Bacon, next level and the pancakes... only lasted a hot second. Still to this day, I crave the perfectly balanced play between the sweet and salty this dish has to offer. This one lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this restaurant 3 stars but because of one of their dishes, I decided to give them 4.

I came here for dinner around 6 on a Friday and my friend and I were seated right away. The server was friendly. She didn't rush us to order nor did she disappear throughout the whole night when we needed her.

We got crab cake for $15. I expected 2 fairly large crab cakes for that price. However, they gave us 3 ... marshmallow size. Once I saw how tiny the portion was I knew I had to change my expectations of this restaurant. I'm clearly paying for quality over quantity. The crab cakes were tasty, I think it was packed with crab taste but not exactly something I would recommend getting.

Next, we got the Handmade Ricotta Gnudi ($13) with Swiss chard and sauteed wild mushrooms. It's definitely very cheesy. They gave us 5 that are the size of a quarter (but in a ball). Again, not something I would recommend getting.

What I LOVED here was the risotto with caramelized squash ($24 or $25). Now, the portion is reasonable and more importantly, it tasted AMAZING. I had risotto at several restaurants and I'm disappointed each time but this risotto was delicious. It's sweet, the consistency of the rice was good and it had this very special, unique taste that I really enjoyed. I don't have the best palette but I think I tasted some mango (I might be wrong though because I don't remember reading mango in the description) but there was definitely something aside from the squash taste.

Lastly we got dessert. There was a pumpkin cheesecake ($9) so I had to get it. The bottom of the cheesecake was made with ginger spongecake and the cheesecake was topped with sour cream cheese. There was also a reduction of bourbon. The whole thing was topped with roasted pumpkin seeds (I think). This is my favourite pumpkin cheesecake in town because there was a lot of pumpkin taste and they actually used pumpkin seeds instead of pistachio or some other seeds/nuts.

Their menu isn't up to date on the website so you might want to call in to see if they still have these items on their menu."}
{"text":"I am sad to write this review. Mildred's was my favourite restaurant in Liberty Village - the staff was always great, the food very good - they care about the environment, local food sourcing, in-season products and have a comfortable modern decor. I've eaten there probably a dozen times from romantic dinners to patio drinks to brunch with my mom. 

And then a couple of Saturday's ago at about 7:30pm a group of us were looking for somewhere to have dinner. 6 of us. Knowing it was sort of last minute we called and were surprised but pleased that they said they could take us at 9pm - great! We got there and there wasn't a table ready for us - so be it, one of the other tables took longer than expected. So they seated us at the bar. That's when things took a turn. We stood there for 20  minutes with no one speaking to us, offering us a drink or even saying hello. They were clearly busy but even when we got the attention of the bartender he only took a drink order from two of us and ignored the rest of our party. We were quite hungry as it was already 9:30pm and we asked if we could order an appetizer at the bar. This was met with almost annoyance by the staff but we managed to order something small.

When we got to our table we had ordered a couple of more appetizers while still at the bar and we asked for them to be sent to the table. We waited another 20 minutes and no server came to speak to us at all and someone flew by with the charcuterie plate and literally threw it on the table at us. No server came to our table to take our dinner orders or further drinks. Needless to say, we left. We had spent over $300 to be either ignored or treated rudely. 

We asked to speak to the manager on the way out - as I say, this had been a favourite place of mine and thought they should know. My boyfriend and I regularly recommended this place to clients and friends and thought they might appreciate hearing about our experience. The manager couldn't care less. She was abrasive and said, \"oh, I guess we've lost your business then\". Hardly an appropriate response. She offered a free shot at the bar to just the boys in our party - not what we were looking for at all, we had wanted a nice meal.

If they were too busy to take the reservation they should have said so and at least apologized. We received nothing but disdain from the moment we arrived. Our dinner party ended up at Shoeless Joe's on King St which was packed with at least twice as many people watching the rugby game and we had pleasant, efficient service, if not the best food in town.

So, we will never go back there, nor recommend it to anyone else. Unfortunate."}
{"text":"Came Saturday afternoon for brunch.
Waited 40 mins for a seat at the bar infront of the dirty dish basin.

I got vedas, my first time having eggs Benny so I'm not sure how it is really supposed to taste like since I have nothing to compare with. I found the smoked salmon to be hard, a bit like jerky. My friend said it was very flavourful. I found the sauce on the eggs to have little taste.

The greens were tasty, as were the side potatoes. Some peices were crunchy to the centre - completely fried so no soft potato inside. I got a side of ketchup and house made hot sauce. Hot sauce was wonderful. The server said they used over 10 ingredients in it. Strong but very flavourful. Tasted a bit like shrimp cocktail sauce. If you choose half greens and half potato, there is an extra $1 charge.
Portion size was small compared to most brunch places and to most food places in general. I honestly think it is way overpriced for what you get. Portion wise and the ingredients aren't anything fancy. You could make the entire thing yourself honestly.

Venue is quite nice and I noticed a lot of fancy looking people there. I may go again to treat a friend for a special occasion but not the greatest place for tasty food."}
{"text":"This isn't the type of place I would go back to despite the friendly and accommodating staff. The plates were eclectic which matched the hipster crowd of Liberty village. When we ordered our dishes we were shocked that the meats didn't come with any rice or starch. One came with quinoa but the serving was so small I didn't see it at first. We asked for rice and they were very confused. They didn't have anything so they ended up giving us steak frites or fries for free. We were happy with the service but the food was just okay. Considering the price and lacklustre menu I would not come back."}
{"text":"The food is really good, but this place isn't at all what it was in its old location. 

The daytime hostess seems completely disinterested in life, the wait staff all look kinda frumpy (not like physical appearance; more unkempt), and holy hell the kitchen is slow. Although the wait staff weren't in any hurry either.

The food really is good though. I have their cookbooks, so I think I would just get industrious and work from those instead :)"}
{"text":"Best. Brunch. Ever.

I love Mildred's. I've been to a lot of brunch places and Mildred's is still a stand-out win for me. All the dishes on the menu are excellent. I love Veda's choice the most, but if you're unsure of what to order, go with whatever specials they have for the day!

THE HOT SAUCE. Definitely try their addictive hot sauce! I wish they sold this separately and when I asked, they did say they were looking into it. 

My only gripe with this place is the wait. Don't come here for your first meal of the day. They do not take reservations on weekends and the wait for a table is at least an hour depending on what time you come and how large your party size is. Don't come starving! Have a snack or hang out at Starbucks while you wait, because even the food takes awhile to come out after you order.  

TIP:
If you want to try the pancakes, but don't want it for an entire meal, get a small side order instead to share! It's not overly sweet and it's very fluffy. I don't usually like pancakes because of sweet and heavy it is, but I do like them here!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best pancakes I've ever had. It comes with 3 large, very fluffy pancakes toped with syrup, cream and blueberry compote. There wasn't enough blueberry or cream but the waitress was kind enough to provide extra after we asked. Would definitely come back for the pancakes.

The big brunch skillet was also good and hearty. It could have benefited from a side of starch as there are only a few potatoes in it. A tortilla would have gone perfectly with it."}
{"text":"I went here for Saturday brunch. My friend arrived at 11 to put our name on the list because of the horrow stories we've heard about having to wait...we ended up waiting 2 hours before we got a table. Of course, we had to get the buttermilk pancakes which everyone raves about and they did not disappoint! It tasted like cake! A heavenly delicious cake which I will definitely be going back for more of! I ended up getting the special brunch skillet that day with duck, roasted potatoes and it was a delicious concoction. It's very similar to the big brunch skillet which is permanently on their menu and I would definitely recommend it! My boyfriend got the huevos monty which tasted super fresh! And of course, how can you have brunch without a mimosa ( I've never had a mimosa that I didn't enjoy). Overall, I think it's a brunch spot that everyone should try at least once and the pancakes are non-negotiable. :)"}
{"text":"An absolutely beautiful and quite enormous interior space in the middle of the city; Mildred's temple is more like a temple oasis. 

Lunch is a hot ticket, so much so that you either need a reservation or you are made to wait it out. Is it worth it? Well, that sounds like a question from someone who hasn't actually tasted the blueberry pancakes. 

You are either a waffle guy or a pancake guy, you can't play both sides of the fence. Personally I'd go with the waffle any day of the week. But this is something else entirely. This is the kind of dish that forces you to commit culinary treason. These stacked fluffy pillow cakes are heavenly indeed. The far and away top seller and the house specialty, for good reason. The best pancakes I have ever had, and it's not even close. This takes first, second, and third prize. 

From what I hear from my neighboring diners, this is the kind of place where everything is so good but you find yourself never wanting to not get the pancakes, thus a constant dilemma ensues. These are the kind of problems I want in my life....

Note: although you'll have to pay, the restaurant is actually attached to a parking garage. You could always try your luck with street parking."}
{"text":"Why am I even bothering to write a review for this place. I've eaten dinner and brunch here and both meals started literal parties in my mouth, definitely a 'can't talk, eating' type of place.

Key take aways:

Beautiful interior design, great service.

Pancakes are a must, treat yo'self and do savory too.

My friend and I spent quite some time debating whether to get savoury or sweet breakfasts, given Mildred's reputation of their pancakes we were stuck for a split second as there was no option to order a side pancake. 

We looked knowingly at each other, aware that we would be ordering a savoury meal each and then the pancakes to share - needless to say, we are pro-food. However, as we were about to make our order we were informed we could order single pancakes, phew!

I was recommended the salmon eggs bennie on a croissant, so indulgent, enjoyment every bite. The pancakes were light and fluffy, like a mix between a scone and a cake. Smother them in maple syrup and you'll have yourself a happy tummy!"}
{"text":"3.5/5! 
*This review is only for Summerlicious dinner - $35. 
*Imo lunch menu is better since they have the legendary pancake. That pancake itself worth $16 and Summerlicious lunch is only $23!
*the service is impeccable. My server was really friendly, casual yet professional. The restaurant feels elegant but not stuffy nor pretentious.

-House Cured Trout: 
The cured trout was really tasty, I liked how the saltiness of the lump fish roe and sweetness of the melon really complimented one another. The soft whipped cream cheese, refreshing cucumber and slightly bitter (and aromatic) dill really enhanced the flavor of the cured trout when eaten in one bite!

-Soup of Sweet Corn: 
The sweet corn soup is a little bit thin for my liking, as I'm used to the Asian style of a thick and silky soup texture. With that said, because of the thin texture, the soup wasn't too filling and perfect as an appetizer! The flavors of the soup was amazing. It was not too sweet as the lime balanced out the sweetness of the corn and coconut milk, and the chili lent a subtile hint of spice. 

-Coffee Smoked Baby Back Ribs: 
It wasn't my favourite. Normally I don't like coffee in the marinade as it accentuates the bitter and smoky flavors of the rib. However I'm glad the coffee wasn't too strong so I was still able to enjoy the meat itself and other ingredients.

I never fully appreciated grits, until I tasted the aged cheddar grits at Mildred's Temple Kitchen, which was the most incredible grits I have ever had. It was seasoned perfectly, cheesy and just a little gritty - it's a very strange texture, different from mashed potatoes lol

-Pan Seared Lake Erie Silver Bass: 
it was the highlight of the night. The skin was perfectly crisp, and the meat of the fish was delicate and moist. I loved the accompanying stew which consisted of tomatoes chunks, potatoes and chickpeas. You know how don't like kale, but here the chef saut√©ed with the chorizo, which helped to mask that bitterness with a spicy kick.

-'Strawberry Shortcake': 
Instead of the normal biscuits, Mildred serves the strawberry shortcakes with the earl grey tea cake. It was good but not great either. I think it would have been better if the earl grey tea flavor was stronger in the cake, but I love anything with earl grey so maybe that's just me.

-'Sugar Plum': 
 Again the Sugar Plum dessert was okay and for me it was a nice way to end the meal after having the heavy main course. The honey mascarpone brought down the tartness of the black plums and toasted oatmeal added some textures to the dessert."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch!  Really great eggs benny on a croissant and rosemary potatoes!

I'm not much of a pancake person but their buttermilk pancakes are amazing, they serve it as a dessert you can share after brunch as a taster.  Really recommend! 

Ambience is very contemporary as well.  Only down side is there is usually a pretty long wait, but overall love this place!"}
{"text":"This review is for their 9-3 Brunch.

We arrived at around noon and was told that the wait is about 1.5hrs. Since the hype was real on Yelp, and the fact that we already paid for parking, we decided to stick around and wait. There really isn't much to do, I highly recommend driving somewhere else instead of sticking around if your wait is over half an hour. They will text you once the table is ready, and as long as you tell them you are on your way, they will hold the table for you. 

We went back into the restaurant after 1.15hrs of wait, and waited an additional 10 minutes inside before we got called. I noticed the beautiful decor, spacious layout, and dressy atmosphere immediately after I was seated. This is not a place for sweats and hoodies. The menu for their 9-3 brunch is fairly limited, but that doesn't bother me. It wasn't difficult for me to decide on their daily special - lamb skillet, and also ordered a cup of coffee to go with it. 

The wait for the drinks wasn't long at all, our mimosa and coffee came within 5 minutes. The (also) daily special - mango mimosa was decent. The thickness and concentration of the mango slightly overpowered the champagne. Coffee was average, for $3.75, I'd rather be ordering a cup, or even 2 Starbucks coffee. 

Food came shortly - my lamb skillet was definitely not brunch size. I had a HUGE breakfast and was worried I might not be able to finish the dish from this highly anticipated restaurant. The portion of the lamb skillet could merely be passed for an appetizer. The taste of it was unique, and I truly enjoyed every bite of it, but compared to my neighbour tables plates, or anyone else's food, it was pathetic. I finished the entire skillet within 7,8 scoops. Even the other party that came with me for brunch questioned if it was enough. I had two bites of the Veda's Choice - eggs benny in a croissant. The croissant was not buttery, nor was the shell flakey. The hollandaise sauce was more peppery than your traditional hollandaise sauce, wasn't the biggest fan. Our server checked up on us once, but didn't really bother us for the rest of the meal. 

Mildred's is known for their pancakes, unfortunately I am not a fan of pancakes. Maybe that's where all the hype comes from, but for the non-pancake dishes, it's a no-go for me. 

I have to admit though, display of the foods are Instagram worthy. But at the end, the bill was much more than what the foods actually represented. Plus the wait time, the only thing I truly enjoyed was the company."}
{"text":"LITERALLY THE BEST BRUNCH I'VE EVER HAD. And like any other millennial who's been hungover, I love brunch. But I'm often skeptical of paying 20 dollars for eggs and screw top sparkling white wine. Not so with this place. The blueberry pancakes were utter perfection, I have no idea how they get them like that. And little simple touches like rosemary on the bacon were spot on. Also enjoyed the scones/ biscuits and apple butter- all of it just done beautifully, as well as the seasonal special which was a riff on eggs benny with an asparagus tart instead of english muffins. Beyond the food, normally at a place like this I've gotten used to servers greeting me with over-it-hipster scowls, but the service was warm and welcoming. I judge service when things go wrong. The bacon took a teensy bit longer than it probably should have, and several staff members apologized profusely and they took it off the bill. I was welcomed by several staff members upon entering, and several said goodbye and checked if everything was all right on the way out. Really just a fantastic experience all around."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the perfect impromptu brunch experience as we were in the neighbourhood for an errand and we were so delighted that we made that on the fly move. We were very fortunate to be taken care of by a superstar named Pablo, he treated us as it seemed he would enjoy to be treated which was like gold. He navigated us through our meal with excellence and grace and thank goodness he suggested the option to order one perfect pancake as a dessert to share, because that is always what we wish for, but never have the room for a full order. The food was savoy and sweet and we cannot wait to return for more magic:)"}
{"text":"Brunch with the family. Great spot in Liberty Village. We arrived early to put our name down.  Reservations are not taken ahead. Staff will only seat you once all the people from your table has arrived. Long line ups, but worth the wait. Great open concept. Bright and friendly atmosphere. The kitchen counter was visible as the Chefs and servers coordinated orders.
We started off with freshly baked scones. Served with apple butter.  Delicious! We all had mimosas. We had to order their famous blueberry pancakes....to die for. We each ordered different items so we could taste it all. I have to say this was a very enjoyable brunch. So different from the norm bacon and eggs, omelettes.  Our waiter new we had a birthday celebration so a chocolate moose desert was plated with chocolate Happy Birthday written around the edge of the plate. Very nice. I understand from the birthday boy quite delicious."}
{"text":"Blueberry pancake was worth it! You can order only one portion if you want and try other items. It's not mentioned on the menu so be sure to ask.


Service was great. 

Atmosphere relaxing. I did go during the week so the weekends I assume are a lot busier.

Will return."}
{"text":"This place is super busy. On weekends after 1130 or so, you're going to wait for hours. The service here is spotty. The hostess on this particular saturday morning was very awkward. Thought it was both rude and hilarious that the hostess had the tenacity to correct my friend on the pronunciation of her own name. \"did you mean...\" We had a good laugh, but couldn't take her seriously after that. She would be great as a starbucks barista. 

Food here is okay, but nothing worth waiting for. The pancakes are probably the best thing on the menu. The decor of the place is very nice and very minimalist."}
{"text":"An amazing little brunch place tucked away in Liberty Village. Although, the place is pretty spacious it tends to get crowded pretty fast so you might get stuck waiting in line or eating at the bar. However, the wait is well worth it. I ordered the blueberry pancakes, they were fluffy and delicious. They weren't too sweet and is something I'll be dreaming about for the weeks to come. Their menu is nothing original or different but they serve the brunch basics and they do it well.

The staff is incredibly friendly and will answer even the most annoying questions you have. Although, we were asked a little too often if we wanted drinks with the meal. The service is prompt and courteous which adds to the overall dining experience.

Such a cute place, I'd highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday morning around 10am and beat the rush! We only waited for about 15 min for a table for two. My partner ordered the famous buttermilk pancakes and they were so fluffy and delicious! I ordered the pulled pork skillet - and the eggs were cooked perfectly (i wanted them over hard), and the flavours of everything worked so well together. The pork was a bit too spicy for me. The hot chocolate was made with delicious Belgian chocolate and so creamy and delicious! We ordered two scones to-go, and enjoyed them later. They are so tasty - highly recommend! Would love to come back to try their other menus."}
{"text":"Great food, loved big breakfast skillet and of course the signature pancakes! Good service, a bit of a wait, but they are considerate to your time and text you when the table is available so you can stroll in the Liberty Village while waiting."}
{"text":"So the line was very long for brunch on a Sunday (arrived at 1:30 and were seated around 2:15pm). But no worries, my husband gave his name and phone number then we went shopping at a nearby store until they texted him to tell us the table was ready. Service was ok despite how busy it was (but the couple beside us seemed to have a different experience in which their service was slower than ours). Atmosphere: nice decor but a little too noisy for my liking. My husband ordered the blueberry pancakes and I ordered the big brunch skillet. The pancakes were absolutely delicious. It's thick, fluffy yet dense in a sense because it's made with buttermilk. The pulled pork is supposed to be spicy. For myself, I found it spicy enough but I can't really tolerate that much spice, so some people may not find it that spicy. It tasted ok but I probably would not order this again. We also ordered a side of the crispy Rosemary potatoes and they were VERY good."}
{"text":"what a great brunch.  BE WARNED... she told us the wait time would be an hour and a half, and it WAS an hour and a half.  As soon as we sat down, even though the place was pretty full the servers were very attentive and nice :)  We were going to order something other than the Vera... but the server recommended it and we went for it.  YUMMY!!! we also ordered a plate of blueberry pancakes, and they are SO WORTH IT.  They are like really light and fluffy scones.  (which makes them heavy pancakes).  I wish I had some right now...."}
{"text":"I went here with a few girl friends for lunch & it was probably one of the most pleasant and accommodating experience I've received in a while. 

The place is quite huge and spacious which is great because we also had an infant (1 yr) with us. They offer high seats so don't be afraid to bring kids. The kitchen is in the dining area so you can see the chefs cooking.

Our food was amazing. We ordered pancakes to share and each got our own dishes. None of us complain and everything was super delicious. The waitress was amazing! She prayed with the baby and even bought a dessert brownie for us free of charge because we were celebrating a friends birthday. 

All in all, an amazing experience. I'm pretty sure we'll return."}
{"text":"No matter how terrible a place, I have never witnessed the staff describe a dish at their own restaurant as \"disgusting\". 

I made reservations for dinner at 8:00 p.m. on Friday. While my friend and I sat down and began studying the menu, I overheard the couple beside us asking questions about the dessert menu. I was completely shocked to hear the server scoff that the Cheesecake was \"disgusting, don't order it.\". I was immediately turned off after that comment. Who wants to eat at a restaurant where the staff are not 100% behind every single dish on the menu?! A big NO-NO.

The food does deserve 2 stars for dinner (brunch is better). The Caesar salad was overloaded with salt and the Gnocchi poutine had so much oil in it we could not stomach the last half. Perhaps the server was right in her opinion about the food here. Unfortunately this painted a terrible picture in my head with that nasty comment that stuck with me the for rest of the night. Needless to say I did not opt for dessert either."}
{"text":"Went in for the B'lunch on a Monday afternoon.
First of all, this place served the best coffee I have ever had in my life. I was informed that it was made from Ethiopian beans and it was absolutely fantastic!
I ordered the huevos Monty for my main course - a taco base filled with beans (with some delicious marinade) closed with another taco, two fried eggs, guacamole and sour cream. Honestly it didn't look great but when I took the first bite, I knew I was in heaven!

My friend ordered the grilled cheese on sourdough with French fries. Yum! 

For desert we shared a side serving of their famous blueberry pancake (one pancake is for $6 - so worth it!)

Our total came to roughly a little over $42 and it was absolutely fantastic.

I think I've found my new favourite brunch place!

Only complaint is that the time from when we ordered to when the food came on our table was quite a while. It was a considerable wait. However our waiter was so wonderful as he kept refilling the delicious coffee and gave great recommendations for the food.

It was a $20 drive for me, but definitely worth it. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is always delicious. The Buttermilk pancakes, scones, Huevo Monty for Brunch are amazing. Beware of the 1 hour wait though.."}
{"text":"We had a dinner on a Friday evening.  The dining room is larger than I expected, they also have a small patio.

Appetizers: hard to choose as many looked good - we shared the shrimp/crab cakes. 3 small cakes on a skewer over a salad. OK but overly salty. Not really what I was expecting.

Entree: very generous sized short rib was very tasty, served with couscous which is never that interesting. Chinook salmon (special) was good.

Desert: the pecan square with caramel was very good. Special for the day was a peach cobbler - tasted OK but was served at room temperature while I expected it to be warm.

Service was \"laissez faire\" which surprised me."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food
-1 stars for the service

The quality seems to have gone down since the last time I was here. The blueberry pancakes aren't as tasty as before. I heard it's because they switched what they put into the batter to make it more healthy instead of using some cream they used before.

I tried a new dish, which was the Big Brunch Skillet, which had some interesting Mexican-inspired flavours which is pretty good for Canada.

Also the hostess was pretty dry to us, and treated us like any customers. You can tell she dread every second she was there. It hurt our experience before even trying the food. She also told it would be a 30 - 40 minute wait but ended up being an hour, I think the hostess is not that great if she can't accurately estimate the wait time."}
{"text":"I haven't had pancakes in so long, I almost forgot how they taste, so the moment I came across a photo of Mrs. Biederhof's Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes, I was totally hooked to make the trip here. 

We were lucky to slip a reservation in for Monday brunch because the weekends were completely booked--even weeks in advance. I must say that for a Monday afternoon, the restaurant was pretty crowded. I came here solely for the blueberry pancakes but then I saw unfinished plates of the pancakes being taken back and I got a bit worried. Unless you can really run on loads of sugar, it is pretty hard to kill a whole plate of purely sweet pancakes all at once. Despite being a sweet dish, it was not as sugar overloaded as some of the pancakes I've had in the past, but it was heavy. The pancakes were fluffy (but not light) and the fresh blueberries and cream topping really hit the spot, especially being my first meal of the day. If you come with someone else, try to share a savory plate to balance out your taste buds. In the end, I became a common case and ended up becoming a victim of not clearing out the plate. A bit pricey ($16) for pancakes and the brunch menu is quite small, but it seems like everything is made from scratch, so you're also paying for the freshness.

I honestly didn't expect the decor to be so modern looking and definitely didn't expect the restaurant to be so fairly new, but the interiors are nice and the setting is very relaxed. Service was nice but somewhat slow. I came here just to try the pancakes but it didn't \"WOW\" me enough to want to make the trip here again."}
{"text":"Toronto doesn't yet know how to brunch properly (go to Washington, D.C. to learn how it's done). That's why Mildred's makes you wait a while for a tiny menu and overpriced cocktails (and as someone who doesn't drink even I knew something was amiss).
Trendy spot filled with Liberty Village denizens and hipsters. My table of very non-Liberty Village friends and I stopped by Mildred's for my birthday brunch. 
The pancakes are worth the order - but I had to ask for maple syrup before finishing my dish as the cakes got a little on the dry side. 
Good menu - hope they'll expand it by a few items to offer more variety during brunch. 
Is it worth the hype? Meh. It's a nice enough spot but not worth the 45min to 2-hour wait for such a small menu. 
Service was fantastic. Our server was attentive and friendly. Gold star for her."}
{"text":"Food was great! It was my first time here and we wanted to try everything! I would recommend the \"manhandler\" -- the steak was sooo delicious with the eggs. The b'skillet was also good, but definitely get their blueberry pancake which they are infamously known for~ it comes with 3, which we just shared in the middle and dug right in. I'm not usually a fan of pancakes but these were prob the best I've ever had. Server was knowledgable of the menu, informed us on what was popular and always made sure my water glass was filled. I don't live close to this area at all but I will definitely make the trip back with my gfs for that steak *drooool*"}
{"text":"They go pretty far to make this place have a higher end feel. You won't see a bottle of ketchup or hot sauce here, they bring it to you in nice little white dishes (and then presumably throw the remainder out when you are done with it). But if you want soy milk in your coffee instead of milk  (not a latte...just a coffee) they will charge you 25 cents. So cheap!  On a $60 dollar brunch for two it seem ridiculous to charge that 25 cents. I complained to the server and seems like she's had this complaint before and she was all ready with her 'soy milk costs more' speech. The brunch was actually OK but I will not return due to the silly soy milk policy. Coffee was not that great anyways, it was a bit watered down."}
{"text":"Best ever!! I got the blueberry pancakes and they were incredible. Seriously the best breakfast I've had.... Our waiter, Pablo was so so nice and attentive. I never write reviews but this place was so great that I had to. Staff was wonderful and so was the food. Also-- get the hot chocolate!!"}
{"text":"Sick pancakes!!!, Mildred's i dont know how you do it but damnnnnnnnn....super fluffy. Good for sharing."}
{"text":"Can't tell if Mildred's is actually not that great, or the typical Toronto hype made me expect far more than I should've? Anyway, it's more of a 2.5 star and it's not because anything is wrong - there's just nothing GREAT. Huevos Rancheros were fine, but bland and uninspired and the pancake was impressive looking - but for me that's where it ended. The service was great, and the d√©cor is fun so I understand the appeal. Fun and easy cocktails, 3 types of mimosas and a bright and airy space that's perfect for pictures.

I won't actively protest another visit, but they've missed the mark for me. That being said, I'm sure I'm not their target customer."}
{"text":"First off I'd like to mention I am definitely not an easy person to please food wise. But WOW, Mildred's Temple Kitchen has the best brunch in Toronto. I ordered the blueberry pancakes and eggs benny croissant, and both were the best dishes my lucky taste buds have ever touched. I'm not exaggerating... the blueberry pancakes were rich, buttery, and had amazing texture. Each bite contained a perfectly balanced sweetness-to-fruit ratio, which is something I personally desire when eating sweet dishes. The hollandaise croissant was simply heavenly.

I went on a day when it wasn't busy, so I had no issues with wait and over-crowding. The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is decent (high ceilings, trendy decor pieces & art), but it could be improved. 

Food was 5/5 (more than perfect)
Service was 5/5 (no issues)
Atmosphere was 3/5 (just okay)

I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Came for brunch. We got lucky and there wasn't a line up.  I got the skillet of the day which was good but I felt the portion was a little small or was missing meat or something.  The huevos monty were way better.  And we also got the blueberry pancakes of course .  Ps you can order a side of pancakes instead , so it's a small portion. Perfect way to end the meal."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Mildred's - we had the Huevos Monty, blueberry pancakes, and Veda's choice. The food was very good however the service wasn't the greatest. The server kept mixing up our orders and it took about an hour for the food to come out. Must have: blueberry pancakes."}
{"text":"I had an amazing croissant with salmon. We shared their pancakes just to say we tried them. They were Ammmmmazing!
Line ups always but amazing service."}
{"text":"While watching Jesse Palmer on TV a few weeks back, he was mentioning some of his fave places to go in Canada.  He said the pancakes at Midred's were out of this world.  My sis and i came here on Canada day, and we were prepared to order them, but they are massive and we had just come from a coffee at Thor.  Instead we opted for The Lottie  - \"It Keeps Me Thin, Mrs. Pierce\" fris√©e salad with oven-roasted wild mushrooms, rosemary bacon and topped with your choice of poached or   sunny side up egg ... 12.95.  The frisee was lightly dressed, but had the perfect amount of acid and salt and pepper.  The wild mushrooms were cold, i am pretty sure they serve them like this intentionally but I would have liked them to be warm.  The bacon was delicious, but there were only four small pieces total, probably combined to be the length of one standard slice of bacon.  Overall it was the perfect light breakfast, my only complaint was the bacon was a bit greasy, and the eggs were cooked harder than we specified.  

As for service, it was nothing exceptional, our server took our order, and pretty much just came over with the debit machine at the end to complete our transaction and move on to the next table.  

Overall i really enjoyed the food, Liberty Village isn't right downtown so it takes a bit to get out there, but i would come back  to try the pancakes."}
{"text":"Me and my wife came to Toronto and were visiting from Detroit and we discovered this brunch spot. Great brunch spot it was. I had the blueberry peak cakes and they were out of this world good. I asked for extra blueberries also because that what everyone on Yelp said to do. Good call. The only downside about this place is they wanted to charge $5 for a 6oz glass of fresh orange juice with no refills which is crazy. Also be prepared to wait at least an hour to sit down during brunch time. Other than that food was great."}
{"text":"The food was good but expected more from all fuss people were making. 

The wait killed us.  We were quoted an hour so we walked around and came back. We waited a total of 1 hour 20 minutes and were seated just as we were walking out. When we came back they told us we were the next table of three but found they seated others before us. Had to complain twice to make sure we were really next.  They also forgot our biscuits and scones.  But the waiter gave us one for free even though we cancelled the order."}
{"text":"Hands down, they serve the best blueberry pancakes in Toronto. The blueberry flavor is perfectly infused throughout the dough, and the texture has the best delicate balance of fluffiness and gooey-ness. The exterior is lightyly burnt, given just the right amount of crisp. Definitely a must try, even if you just end up with pancakes for brunch. I don't typically love pancakes, and I fell in love with these ones."}
{"text":"Brunch for days. They don't take reservations so you better arrive early. We got here at around 11 and had about an hour wait. Place is packed!!

Love the d√©cor. The staff is great and friendly :) after I mentioned it was my friends bday (and ordered 2 scones) they brought an extra for us :) so nice! Scones are $6 for two. 

We decided to share the infamous blueberry pancakes $16. Wow. It was probably the best pancake I've ever had.

Also ordered the bene with bacon $15 and I could barely finish it after all the other food. I managed though. Perfect amount of everything. 

Can't say anything bad about this place. You may have to wait but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Had a special event dinner here! It was awesome! Great location and ambiance. Our area was raised and pretty private from everyone else. 

The service here is amazing. The staff is so friendly. They were very accommodating with everything. We went with the prix fixe and it came with 3 courses plus a soup. There was a vegan, someone who's dairy-free, and someone who didn't feel so well and couldn't do any solids and they were very accommodating for each and every one of them. They also allowed us to bring our own celebratory cupcakes for second dessert and had a nice area for us to set them up at. 

The recommended bottle of red wine was delicious and exceeded my expectations. 

The food was delicious! I drank a lot of wine and still remember everything! Spicy cornbread, can't remember the soup but it was pretty good. Who knew something like kale Caesar salad could be so good? I forgot it was kale. The carrot salad was also very delicious and unlike anything I've ever had. The steak was delicious and very flavourful, cut in strips. The Indian-style chicken dish was delicious too--it wasn't greasy like Indian food can be and had lots of other veggies going on with it. I don't remember the desserts--probably when the wine really hit me--but I'm pretty sure they were delicious. 

So much food! Had to take home the extras. Quality and quantity. Everything seemed very healthy yet filling. The vegan and dairy-free loved their meals too. 

This place couldn't have made my special event any better. It was a great experience. I would highly recommend going here for a small any special event reception or group dinner. We were a pretty good sized group and they accommodated us all. The service is amazing, the food is delicious, the wine is good, not rushed at all... I would say it was perfect!

Thank you, people at Mildred's!"}
{"text":"Hanna Street does exist. I spent over twenty minutes cycling up, down, and around it in disbelief that I wasn't able to find it myself before I stopped a strolling couple for directions. The restaurant ended up not really being on Hanna at all (well it is, but on the most technical of ways). Walking along Hanna will point you in the right direction though. The main entrance really doesn't look like much, but the door that looks like it would take you to a more impressive entrance will only lead you to a sweaty fitness centre.

The artfully decorated, slightly industrial dining space was filled with casual weeknight diners, which was likely to have been the doing of Summerlicious ($35) and the explanation for the incredible gaps between each of our three courses. Even the drinks took what seemed to feel like forever to come out. Luckily, the glass of 2008 viognier ($12) that finally arrived after our starters because of a \"small accident at the bar\" was simply delicious.      

The white tuna appetizer on a buttery broth was delightfully light and rich at the same time. The arctic char entree on a bed of potatoes was bathed in a very similar savory broth that I wish wasn't so similar. The deconstructed strawberry shortcake came with really crusty pastry and would've more accurately been named a pie. Everything was good, but not mind blowing. I would be very interested in coming back and going a la carte.

The toilets that flush \"automatically\" when you \"gently close the lid\" to activate the sensors were not as sensational as I imagine the designer had expected. The explanation/instructions are lengthy and in fine print. I doubt most people even bother reading them. There was also no toilet paper, but lots of paper towels strewn all over the floor of the unisex stall. 

I'm going to assume that that was just an off night, but Mildred better shape up if I'm going to give her a second chance."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue.. was here in the summer for a brunch date and loved it. The blueberry pancakes are a must try, but get the half order so you can try other items. 

I think I had something called Vera's choice? It was a croissant sandwich and delicious, but not anything too special.. 
the pancakes were the most memorable.

The coffee was tasty and the fresh juices were nice.

Service was exceptional and the atmosphere more upscale and modern than your mom and pop family diner. 


Would definitely try this place again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Visited here for brunch today.

Walked in with 3 of my friends, and asked for a table for 4, they advised it would be a 2-2.5 hour wait time, requested for a phone number and told me they would send a text msg when a table is ready.

We ended up waiting for just under an hour by Starbucks down the road. 

Prices are a tad expensive for brunch, but the portions are fair.

We all ordered veda's Choice, great selection.  It was made very well!  Service was EXCELLENT. I loved our server, she was pleasant and fun. She also made great recommendations for drinks.  To end off our brunch, she also gave us a free tea.

Great experience!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!! everytime i'm craving pancakes, this is my go-to place! If you've had their pancakes, brace yourself, cuz any other pancakes won't do. They're so fluffy and warm, and the compote that comes with this just brings it over the top! an order comes with 3 pancakes and it's more than enough! I also like their scones (a bit too pricey I might add) and mimosas! Not to mention the decor and vibes in here are so positive and bright"}
{"text":"Truthfully, this review lauds the decor more so than the food, also we came during brunch which is a tricky way to gauge a resto's menu value by the brunch barometer alone.

Beautiful and ample space-age-esque surroundings it feels like an upscale cafeteria that would be featured in the Jetsons except no Elroys to be found here...more like some \"douchy\"  20-40ish somethings.

Meh patrons notwithstanding, I order the adorably titled
Lottie Says \"It Keeps Me Thin,Mrs. Pierce\" a fris√©e salad with
oven-roasted wild mushrooms,rosemary bacon and topped with
a fried egg so basically it's a fried egg salad and washed it down with gusto accompanied by an enjoyingly effervescent Mimosa.

Being the WC aficionado that I am I have to give Mildred's bathroom 
serious props. Completely private, modern and enclosed cubicle with personal sink, soap, towels and plenty of leg room.  Mirror spanning the length of the cubicle making it look expansive.  Heck this lavatory is so awesome . If this bathroom was an escape pod, I would be cool habitating in it, plus if a xenomorph crawls from under the sink and tried to mess, I have enough space to roundhouse it's ass then flush it down the commodious crapper.

I'll come back sometime soon, maybe for dinner and  Mildred, don't be offended if I spend a lot of time in the lieu..."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch early Saturday morning (upon opening). Was quite busy and there was already a line!

Food- MUST MUST MUST get their pancakes. If you don't you're missing out!! Highly recommend it. I would only eat this if I had the chance!! Other than that, their food selection is quite healthy and flavourful. Full of fresh and healthy ingredients. 

Drinks- though I didn't get the chance to try their drinks, next time I would. They have quite a unique selection. 

Service- a little on the slow side that day, and they did mix up my order a little bit. Had to get it sent back to the kitchen. Other than that very polite and nice. 

Overall experience- great food! Would definitely come back again for breakfast... and maybe next time try lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the better winterlicious experiences I've had thus far. I've been attending different winterlicious events for over 6 years now, and this makes the top 3. 

First of all, the decor is beautiful and modern. It's casual enough that you can head there for a drink or dinner after work, but it's in no way shabby at all. The couches have pillows, and the place is well-lit, so the atmosphere is definitely there.

As for the service, it was impeccable. Our server was super friendly, and we were greeted by several of the staff. They constantly checked up on our table and made sure that we had a pleasant meal experience.

Finally, it's time to talk about the food! It was a 3-course meal for $38 before tax and tips. As an appetizer, I chose the crab cakes, which were well-seasoned with a salad and sauce. The main course was the pan seared cod with a bed of bean stew (several different types of beans). I chose the churros with chocolate sauce for dessert. The crab cakes were tasty, and a nice introduction to my meal. The cod wasn't overcooked, so it was tender but seared well on the skin side. The beans were very good and it reminded me of this bean stew my mom made in Peru as a kid. The churros were on the slightly lighter side than what I'm used to. They weren't as chewy as the churros I've had (and I've tried many), but they were a perfect finish to the meal; the light dough was pleasant and the chocolate sauce went well with the churros. Also, the portions were very decently sized. My friends and I were quite full by the end our meals. 

I will be coming back for the regular menu. It was well worth the price and a visit. Highly recommended!! I actually wanted to come here for my birthday brunch...but I've heard about the hour long waits."}
{"text":"Lovely. Went here a few years ago, but I remember the staff being exceptional. The pancakes were out of this world, but the friendly, funny waitstaff are what tips this place into 5-star territory for me."}
{"text":"Mildred's temple kitchen makes one of the best blueberry pancakes I'd ever had! Definitely get that if you're unsure what to get. My husband got the salmon croissant with salad. Unfortunately he did not like it so much because the taste of the salmon wasn't so fresh. Next time we will try something else on the menu! The location of this place is a bit discrete, so when you're looking for the place make sure you walk inside the building or around the building to find the spot. It's interior is beautifully designed which leaves you wanting to come back for more."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something delicious to eat for brunch, try Salmon Veda and blueberry pancakes on the side. Just amazing!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pancakes and all the brunch!!  Had the huevos and it was so good I probably will not venture to something new next time.. it closes at 300....   and u will have a wait getting in but it is worth it!!

Be sure to heck out the bathroom. You will hear the air Canada safety message...   also small hint skip the coffee.. this was the only disappointment of the restaurant"}
{"text":"Love this place! 

The good: 
I celebrated my birthday here and it was wonderful! I ordered the Veda's choice and of course, the famous pancakes. The potatoes were on point, you don't even need ketchup because it's so well seasoned! But if you do want ketchup, they also give you a hot sauce that really hits the spot. The pancakes are beautiful and they tasted nice and fluffy. The space is bright and spacious and the server was very friendly. 

The bad: 
If you come in a large group, all your members have to be present for you to wait for a table. They will not seat you so you have to make sure everyone is there. 

Verdict: I'll be back ;)"}
{"text":"blueberry pancakes = must try. Can be hard to find the restaurant itself.. nice decor (esp the washroom haha)

kind of expensive."}
{"text":"I visited Mildred's for the first time today. The wait was about 20-30 minutes at 9:45AM on a Saturday, but they can take down your phone number and text you. 

The service was polite and friendly, we didn't feel rushed at all. The environment was bright and pretty - also super large and the tables were well spaced out. Even though it was very busy, they clearly don't try to cram the place full with tables so you don't feel uncomfortable at all. It was great! 

I ordered 1 of the famous Mildred pancakes with all the toppings ($6 for just the one pancake, see my photo) and their take on an Eggs Benedict, which is two poached eggs in a croissant with Bernaise sauce and either smoked salmon or bacon ($15). I picked bacon. For an extra dollar, I did half Rosemary potatoes on the side and half mixed greens. For $1.50, you can get just potatoes and no greens - and for free, you just get the greens. I also got coffee, which was free flowing.

Overall, I would say the food was absolutely perfect. This is rare for me. I'm extremely picky, especially when it comes to my favourite meal of the day - brunch. But I can't think of one thing I didn't like. 

The pancakes were somehow simultaneously dense and light/fluffy. The whipped cream on top was the best I've ever had and the portion of blueberry compote was perfect. They have these pancakes down to a science. They are PERFECT. If you aren't going to order the full sized meal of them, you have to at least get one. 

The eggs Benedict was delicious and though not your traditional Benny, I'd say it was one of the best I've ever had. The rosemary potatoes were to die for, and even something as average and boring as mixed greens tasted delicious. 

The server was helpful and friendly without being too overbearing, and was kind enough to give us his menu recommendations. He brought me coffee as soon as my cup was empty. Overall...just a perfect experience and despite the wait, I would go back in a heartbeat! 

I can also see why people do weddings here, as the space and atmosphere is very beautiful, modern and unique."}
{"text":"This time I came here with my fiance (who is the same person as my boyfriend was, get it?) and everything has certainly improved! It's also nice that all the positives about the place remains the same. We were told there would be a 40 minute wait but were offered a sweet table in the lounge section, which we took.

I had the Veda's Choice again, this time with salmon. Wow, they certainly improved their bernaise. The croissant was a lot better this time too and really held up against all the liquidy yolk and yummy sauce. The Blueberry Pancakes were also divine. Generous portions of pancakes and cooked to perfection. The currant scones remain delicious as always

Despite one error, which were quickly and generously corrected, we were much happier on this visit than our last. I was very impressed with our server, her personality and attitude was on point. Also, the girl that made my latte has my undying gratitude."}
{"text":"Oh a personal favorite of mine just out of sheer convenience and delicious options. Try the stack of pancakes and Vedas choice for the ultimate foodie satisfaction."}
{"text":"Solid brunch. Blueberry pancakes are really good if you're into that sorta thing"}
{"text":"This is such a great restaurant. The space is so bright and open, styled beautifully. The service all around was phenomenal, we were served by Pablo who went above and beyond helping us. The biscuits and scones are definitely worth getting, they melted in your mouth. The pancakes were very good, but I didn't love my meal (grilled cheese w/egg added) but that may have been my own fault. We would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Came here during the last day of Winterlicious.  Got lost trying to find the place in the freezing cold.  We walked right past it, did a half circle, and walked right past the street we were supposed to turn on and had to turn back (they renamed the street and Google Maps hadn't updated!).  It was cold and I was hungry but this place did not let me down.  The service was excellent, and their Winterlicious menu was very good.  The desserts were my favourite part and very delicious.  I did find it very hard to hear the group I was with though, I don't know if it was poor acoustics or I am going deaf.  For my own sake I'll blame the acoustics.  Its a really cool place inside and you can see the chefs busy at working cooking up a storm.  If you are a baller and loaded with cash you could probably eat here a lot (I would also advise you be my friend), otherwise I'd suggest going only on occasion as prices are pretty high."}
{"text":"Mildred's has been one of my favorite restaurants in the city because of their amazing food, which earns them 2 stars. However, they definitely lost some points based on my last visit. We made reservations for dinner during Winterlicious last week. When we got there, our table wasn't ready. It took them 40 minutes after our scheduled reservation to seat us, for which none of the hostesses or staff apologized at all. When I asked 20 mins past our reservation why our table still wasn't ready, the hostess curtly said \"well I told you guys to wait at the bar\". Once we were finally seated, the food was great and we all looked past the late seating. But just as we finished our dinner, we saw a mouse running around behind us! That definitely crossed the line. Don't know if I can ever go back :("}
{"text":"Food is good but service is very slow. Not bad service, just slow. We were there for brunch on Victoria Day.  Three of the four adults received their order but the last one was left waiting for her food to come out for twenty minutes. We had to walk across the restaurant to track down the server.  

Three of the others food orders got cold because we waited and kept thinking the last order was coming. 

Also, do not expect for anyone to come by afterwards for more drinks or refill of water or coffee. The wait staff do not seen to have sections and take care of tables all over the restaurant so it's hard to find your waiter or waitress when you need them. 

If they can get the service down, it would be a phenomenal restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to Mildred's for the first time today and it was awesome! I did have to wait to be seated, but in the meantime I was offered two free mimosas by Scott! I instead opted for a chai latte and he gladly accepted my change of request. Also, we were so hungry that we ordered a croissant and he offered us a scone as well -- both free!. He was very friendly and he even gave us a side dish of homemade jam and butter made in house. He was very hospitable and apologetic for the wait. I have to say that the drinks and treats made up for the wait and I felt a sincerity from him that I didn't mind it at all; plus there were side tables so it was all good.  After all if the place is packed means people like the food, right! 

After we were seated, the waitress was attentive and pleasant. Our meals were fresh and tasted awesome. My sister is a fan for eggs benedict at many lunch places in Toronto and she loved this one. As for me I had the Spanish plate with guacamole and that was quite good. I would just consider the guacamole and sour cream on the side for me, but that differs from each person to another. 

I have to say the coffee smells great and the lattes are great, Scott mentioned that the syrup is also in house in the lattes. Overall, I had a great experience and it started with Scott's understanding and willingness to make us feel comfortable. He even mentioned he wouldn't mind if we changed our mind after the mimosas. I feel that this is a place that wants your business and that's important. 

I saw the pancakes and I definitely want to try that next. Scott also mentioned that Caesars are what they're known for and when I was seated everyone had one!!! Will try that next. 

I recommend this restaurant and the ambiance is open concept and the bathrooms are like you're in a plane, its funny to hear the announcer talking in the bathroom stall as if you're in the air. Very cute"}
{"text":"I've been here a while ago, so this review may be a little outdated.  Plus, I was only here for brunch, so this review does not apply for dinner.

I have always been a fan of restaurateur Donna Dooher.  I thought that her previous restaurant (Mildred Pierce) was one of the true gems in the city.  That is why I came to Mildred's Temple Kitchen with high expectations.  But as we all know, high expectations can come crushing down.  

The wait time for a table was just too long, especially when you're jonesing for your morning coffee.  This seemed odd, considering the place is so big.  The food itself was underwhelming.  Plus, the restaurant setting, although clean and elegant, seemed a little too sparse and minimalistic, quite in contrast to the retired Mildred Pierce which was an intimate space with big, bold d√©cor.

Will I give Mildred another chance?  Absolutely!  But next time I may try dinner."}
{"text":"I took an Uber to Mildred's and it was a bit tricky because its tucked away within a passageway. However, the signage outside makes it easy to locate. Once inside, the decor is minimalist with a subtle buddhist temple feel. The interior layout is spacious and beautiful allowing both servers and guests to walk amply. I was seated to the left of the restaurant and found that the settings for two offer a large cushion bench with 2 small pillows as borders between your neighbors. Esthetically,the pillows were a lovely touch but were slightly cumbersome to move when I needed to exit the table which was a few times. My server was attentive and the food came out promptly. I ordered the pancakes based on other Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. I don't recommend this serving for just one person as the pancakes are very filling. They were indeed, the best pancakes I've ever had. I was asked if I wanted a side of bacon and said yes. I wasn't told that it would be an extra charge, I could have asked but I would have appreciated if they let me know instead of discovering it on the bill. The bathroom. A trip to the bathroom is worth mentioning because you won't find music playing in the speakers but an Air Canada script in English,French and Spanish. Although I'm very calm, listening to it gave me anxiety because it kept looping to the last boarding call and warning the  captain will close the doors of the airplane in 5 minutes. Traveling by airport is not a relaxing experience and this just brought back the stress. I asked my server about it and he thought it was a creative and charming feature that helped guests to be \"whisked away to another place\". I could not disagree more. Aside from that, the food quality that I had was superb, the decor modern and beautiful. I paid $35 (with tip) for one orange juice, stack of pancakes and a side of bacon. Again, for the price I recommend sharing the food but I would recommend the place for brunch."}
{"text":"Sooooo disappointed.  
We received our coffee and our food at the same time.
 
We went early on a Saturday morning.  We were told we had a server named Clare but we did not see her the entire meal, no wait we did right after another staff member asked if we would like more coffee, she showed up with a pot of coffee and as quick as she came she was gone and not seen again.

The food was okay.  I don't think we will be back.  Very expensive for what you get.

Why did the coffee take so long?"}
{"text":"Went with my friend for brunch, ordered the Bolly Cauli, it was flavoured well and overall tasty. However, arguably I can see how this dish can start feeling very one note in its flavour and the texture can start feeling somewhat mushy. Furthermore, although the portion size was okay, I felt that it was somewhat overprice since it did not feel special.

The pancakes we got though was AWESOME!!! So much so that we got a second order. It just tasted so fluffy and buttery. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now. 

I would definitely return just for the pancakes alone and perhaps order something else on the menu. 

Oh! I forgot to mention that we visited somewhat later in the day and it was not busy at all, as a result we got a take home bag of scones from their brunch service. It was a nice surprise and real yum!"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch one day.

The food: Scones--Not as good as most other places. Pancakes--Fabulous!! Huevos Monty--Great! Burger--Great! The three stars are for the food items mentioned.

Now for the rest. We waited for a while and then when we saw a table was free in the patio for 15 minutes, we told them and got the table. Very strange - didn't they know it was free, since they have 'no reservations' at brunch?

Then we get coffee, and pour the soy milk in it (Mr. T has lactose intolerance). The soy milk was curdled at 11 a.m.!!! Did they leave it out overnight??? Anyhow, they apologized and changed it.

Now for the worst part. From the time the food arrived to the time we paid (about 40 minutes), we were asked if they could clear the table and give us the bill five times. And nobody was waiting, so what kind of behaviour is this. REALLY????? It was so annoying. Everytime we got into a conversation, they'd come and ask, seeing full well that the food isn't even close to being over.

As for the price: it's expensive. The $4.50 for a pot of tea, landed up being just one cup (barely - and not even a mug). It's the same price as about 6 cups of very fine tea in a pot at the Royal York. They need to do a reality check.

I always say 'Good food doesn't make up for bad attitude', so I'm never coming here again. It's with reluctanct generosity that I give it 3 stars for the food."}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved this place!

If I didn't live so far from here, I'd be coming for brunch everyday.
I made a reservation on a weekday. I received a confirmation call from them for the reservation the day before. When I arrived, I immediately knew I'm going to enjoy the food.
I loved the mural art and the cozy/chic vibe. Having been to so many brunch spots in Toronto, this place is a fav!

I ordered Veda's choice (smoked salmon and salad on side) and my friend ordered the Manhandler with a side of salad. Each of us also got one slice of bluberry pancake. They taste as good as they look. 

Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Loved having brunch there and their menu is unique for dinners.  I had Crispy pork belly with a blueberry Pancake topped with a fried egg and I loved the sweet and salty flavours that went in with each bite!!!"}
{"text":"Love. This. Place. 

The brunch menu is super limited and tbh, some items aren't that great, but the things they do well, they do extremely well. 

Start with a cup of fresh grapefruit juice. Blueberry pancakes are to die for. 
Rosemary bacon amazing. (Bacon is never bad)
Eggs Benny on a croissant - incredible. I die eating this every time. 

Share this between two people and you will be happy. 

Beautiful restaurant with outstanding service. 

Always a wait (usually 1hr) but you can shop at metro or kitchen stuff plus or lcbo while waiting. Or bring a book and read or chat at Starbucks while you wait :)"}
{"text":"Tried their famous weekend brunch. It was packed right from their opening time! Their blueberry pancake was amazing as raved by other reviewers!! Other brunch menu items were just mediocre and overpriced. Great service by our server though!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and really suit the location.  Pankcakes definitely live up to the reputation"}
{"text":"I just dined here tonight for Winterlicious, and I couldn't wait to sit down and write a review. Overall, I had an excellent experience, and was truly pleasantly surprised, particularly given that -licious meals in general seem to have an air of \"meh\" around them.

I had made a reservation for 3 at 8:45pm on a Saturday, and we arrived right on time but were told that there would be a bit of a wait. Normally I would be slightly irked, but given that it was a Winterlicious night I suppose it's understandable. Our hostess apologized and informed us that we could sit at the bar and have a drink, and she would come get us when our table was ready. There is a lovely bar right by the main entrance, so we didn't have to stand around awkwardly, jealously watching people eat their meals, which was nice. There is also a seating area with comfortable chairs and a selection of books to flip through - another nice touch. I would say the wait was around 15 minutes or so, but I wasn't watching the clock...I was too busy flipping through books and chatting with my girlfriends to notice.

When we were finally seated, our server James came over to pour water and happily explained all of the menu items to my friend who had some questions. He also brought us cheddar biscuits, which were delicious (but I would have preferred if they were served warm). I chose the Sweet Potato Potage as my appetizer, the Curried Cauliflower as my main, and the MTK Profiteroles for dessert. I also had a glass of Pinot Grigio. Everything was wonderful, and the portions were fairly generous, particularly the main. The Profiteroles were fabulous, the Lindt ice cream was divine...I'm going to dream about them tonight. 

Some people have mentioned that service is lackluster, and one would think this would be particularly noticeable during -licious events, but I have to say that I was truly impressed with the service we received at MTK. We never once felt rushed or neglected, and service was pleasant and friendly throughout the night. I'll also add to the raves about the interior of the restaurant - it's airy and beautiful (albeit a bit loud). 

Total came to $57 including tax and tip - an terrific meal for an terrific deal, in my opinion. I went away feeling full and completely satisfied. Although I can't speak much to the value of this restaurant on a regular night, I really enjoyed dining here and would definitely recommend it for Winterlicious."}
{"text":"I'm an avid brunch person, and the food was delicious. The ambiance and service was amazing, and I will definitely be back. Also, those pancakes are too die for!"}
{"text":"So I have now been to Millie's half a dozen times and I think they deserve an extra star. I have heard horror stories of bad service but frankly this has never been my experience (knock on wood). I have been here for both lunch & dinner and have enjoyed every meal.

Recently I had another Groupon and got to taste their prix-fixe sampler for two which included 4 courses. Every course was incredible, and by the end I was stuffed. 

My only major concern is that the washrooms are kind of gross. They are unisex with automatic flushers which essentially means that when men are done their business standing up... their mellow yellow does not get flushed down because the sensors don't always get activated. Also I don't like the lid up at my place and I am certainly not paying big bucks to do it while out. I guess that beef has more to do with the patrons than the restaurant but it's worth mentioning."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place except for the long wait times, but was totally worth the delicious fluffy pancakes and other entrees! 

Drinks/mimosas were pricy but expected in liberty village."}
{"text":"Came here for their famous blueberry pancakes and I was not disappointed. Although it comes with 3 pancakes, they're really filling and I barely finished mine. The pancakes are dense and fluffy at the same time, and the blueberry topping and fresh whipped cream compliment the pancakes very well and are not too sweet. 
The other menu items are a bit overpriced in my opinion, as we also got the big skillet to share which was not big at all. I'll definitely just stick to the pancakes next time!"}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Sunday morning (11:30AM) and we were told it was a 45 min-1 hour wait, so we put our names down and weren't seated until 1:10PM. We ordered the pulled pork hash, blueberry pancakes, rosemary bacon and biscuits, which were all good but nothing to write home about. The pancakes that people describe as \"pancakes from heaven\" were good but I don't understand what the hype was all about. It was 3 plain buttermilk pancakes with blueberry topping and whipped cream. Not worth the 2 hour wait. The biscuits were good but not great. If you want to try this place out, I recommend coming here on a weekday when its not so packed/busy so you dont have to waste 2 hours of your day. It's also really out of the way to come here... there is no subway station nearby aka expensive cabfare. My boyfriend was nice enough to wait 2 hours just to eat pancakes with me and I will make sure to never put him through such torture again."}
{"text":"Out for dinner with a large group. Service was nothing special, waitress was spunky but kind of rude at the same time. Soup was ok, nothing to write home about. they have a salad with smoked salmon which was pretty good. but alas, they are so cool that they dont offer you salt or pepper at the table, assuming that they have spiced the dish perfectly. let me tell you, you havent, so stfu and give me pepper, idiots. 

Standout dish was the octopus, it was nectar. delicious, absolutely fantastic. i would go back and get 2 orders of the octopus, a bit different then what I fared at enoteca but on the same level if not better.

Tried the steak and it was crap, once again, they barely touched it with salt and it was really needed. 

Would i go back? Yes,  there are a few standout dishes and the decore is really nice. Good place for a date."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Sunday morning, and since we're early risers we arrived before it opened - but there was already a line forming! The restaurant is open and bright with lots of seating, but there was still a line of people waiting for tables when we left. 

I got the Huevos Monty (basically huevos rancheros) and it was really good. My sister had the buttermilk pancakes, which seem to be their specialty. They were huge, fluffy, and very tasty but a bit too sweet for me."}
{"text":"I love Mildred's Temple Kitchen brunch but I don't think I love them enough to wait more than 30 minutes for the experience on a Sunday.

Get the Mrs. Biederhof's Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes! It is one of the fluffiest pancakes I ever put in my mouth. Just like pillows! I love Scones & Biscuits as you can order one each. 

Boozy drink I had was really boozy... I left in such a happy mood.

Service was top notch and our waiter was so friendly and efficient.

OK, Maybe I would come back again for brunch. Or maybe just make a reservation on a weekday for lunch and skip all the agony."}
{"text":"This place is alright. I'm not much of a brunch guy. On paper I love everything about brunch like the timing and the food. But really, I think it's over-hyped and overpriced. The food was good but I wasn't in love with it or anything. I had the blueberry pancakes (they warned you it will take long to make, they weren't kidding) and didn't find it fascinating or anything. Probably not worth the time. My fiancee had Veda's choice with smoked salmon. Now that was a great dish.

I'd come here again if it was an occasion though, but it's not a place I would regularly go."}
{"text":"I'm not exactly a \"fancy restaurant\" kind of person on a daily basis. I know I can find delicious cheap food, and that's usually my goal. And Mildred Pierce (essentially a Toronto institution) does not serve cheap food. So Mildred's Temple Kitchen, by the same people, kind of scared me. But it is beside my gym, and it made me more curious every time I walked past it. So once a friend told me it was good, I decided to try them for brunch (cheapest and tastiest meal of the day).

The place is gorgeous. Obviously. Everything is so classy and clean and new. They've got a bar/waiting area in front, and tons of seating at the back, with an elevated, open kitchen for everyone to see.

As for the menu, brunch looked super simple. Basics with a bit of a gourmet take on them -- better ingredients, fancier cooking methods. Food came extraordinarily fast. Literally we had ordered scones and were still eating them when our food came. I had an Eggs Benedict-type meal with a twist -- Bernaise sauce instead of Hollandaise, a croissant instead of an English muffin. Delicious. Another reason I don't do \"fancy\" places is because they usually skimp out on the portions. Mildred's did not - I couldn't even finish the potatoes after the eggs. My meal was about $12, brunch mains range from $11-$15.

My one problem with Mildred's was that I just felt out of place. I arrived before my friend and was told that I couldn't be seated until my whole \"party\" arrived. So I had to sit at this bar and wait, and ordered a $4 orange juice which got refilled once (!!!), and I just felt like I belonged to a lower caste and they were all secretly hoping I wouldn't touch anything. Not that the staff weren't great (they were all super nice) but it was just a strange feeling that comes with having to sit at a bar at 11 am and being one of the youngest people there besides the hipster toddlers.

As for the crowd, expect a little bit of everything. I was anticipating the Liberty Village crowd -- young urban professionals, condo owners, lots of strollers and whining kids wearing more expensive clothing than me. But there weren't too many of those this time -- I noticed a lot more tourists and couples than trendy families.

Anyway, the verdict on Mildred's is that I might go back. The food was really good and the place is just so pretty. So while I'm generally not a fancy restaurant person, I might come back here for something besides weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Good brunch food but definitely not the wait. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere and there isn't much to do if you have to wait. We went around 2.30 and even then, had to wait around 10 minutes or so to be seated. We got the Veda's choice, the brunch feature (which had polenta and rage in it), and the pancakes. The pancakes and the maple syrup was really really delicious. Veda's choice was pretty good but difficult to eat and definitely not one of a kind."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with 3 friends on a Sunday afternoon because we had to see what the hype was all about. We arrived around 12, which is like peak brunch time and had to take a number and wait for about an hour. Luckily though, there are lots of furniture shops to hang out in around the area and also Starbucks and Metro and other shops where you can kill time, so it's not so bad. The restaurant really is very pretty on the inside, it has high ceilings and cool lights, and makes for a very pleasant dining experience, although prices are a bit higher than your basic brunch place. 

I thought the food was pretty good, not AMAZING, but good enough that I would want to come back... if I was feel patient maybe. I ordered Veda's Special, which is like a poached egg/eggs benedict except on a croissant rather than an English muffin, and it came with a little side salad. It was pretty good, but I disliked the flakiness of the croissant which made it really messy to eat. My friends and I also shared a plate of their famous blueberry pancakes, and let me just say first off... how can anyone finish this whole plate themselves? It comes with three pancakes, but they are HUGE and so thick, but still incredibly soft and fluffy. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved them and thought they were delicious, but the whole plate is a lot - I definitely recommend sharing. 

For the most part everything was good, and our server was really nice when he did pay attention to us, but for a lot of the time he seemed super busy serving other tables or was nowhere to be found. Our food took a long time to arrive to the point where we were all starving and kind of cranky, and similarly when we wanted to pay and leave (brunch ended up being a 2.5 hour affair what with all the waiting), it took forever for us to find him and get the bill. All the waiting definitely soured the experience for all of us, but in general I would say the food here is good enough to warrant trying it at least once."}
{"text":"Have been here for brunch a couple of times and it's just a madhouse as reservations are a no go.  Decided to try this out for dinner and it was very quiet a relaxing; such a change in vibe.  Plates are small and share friendly .  We had the oxtail gnocchi , shrimp and crab cakes and trout.  All very tasty.  The dessert option was a home made funnel cake with rhubarb which was very delicious.  Sweet and tart, soft with crispy edges, a nice way to end the meal."}
{"text":"The good:
The pancakes.
Yes, they are destination worthy. For anyone visiting Toronto this is a must.

The bad:
The pretentiousness, prices.

The ugly:
The wait.
It's annoyingly long.


Toronto Brunch Tip.  Show up at 2:15 for brunch. All Torontonians dine from 11-2 and all restaurants turn into a ghost town after.  You will literally walk right in at 2:30 at Mildred's, and other restaurants, at 2:30."}
{"text":"The food was good, but I found the place to be a little pretentious. If you are a breakfast person, be warned this is a brunch joint. 

That being said, the flavours are great. The pancakes are really heavy... I had to order them after seeing the fantastic pictures on Instagram and Yelp. I couldn't finish them even with my girlfriend's help. I had the sausage side, which is the farthest thing from a breakfast sausage... Tasty but out of place in my opinion. The poached egg on a croissant is what a couple other people at my table ordered and they said it was good.

I got kind of sick of seeing frustrated people at the door patiently waiting for a table. This place is bu-sy. Very long wait, so walk around. I wouldn't recommend waiting at the front of the restaurant because it gets rammed! 

Service was good, also. Overall this place was solid, but slow and not my cup of tea. 

Fyi you can order a single side pancake. It makes sense if you want to try them but don't want a full plate of sugar."}
{"text":"Finally, we got a chance to enjoy their brunch on this Wednesday. Yes in the weekdays because they take reservation only in the weekdays. Friendly  and professional services,  with amazing good food under a clean, comfortable and modern environment. What more you can ask for."}
{"text":"A good test for a restaurant are events like summer/winterlicious or accomodating Groupon deals. A couple nights ago I went to MTK for the first time for their 4-course prix-fixe Groupon deal and I came away very impressed, very satisfied and extremely full!

MTK take great care in everything they do, from the service, to the taste and presentation of the food, and to their decor/environment.
Located in Liberty Village, eventhough traffic could be a nightmare in that neighbourhood there is plenty of parking at a couple lots nearby and in the underground garage of the building.

The restaurant itself has a great atmosphere you rarely get in any other restaurnants. The space is very expansive, open and modern while still feeling casual and comfortable and not at all stuffy or pretensious. 
The bar at the front had a refreshing open and casual atmosphere and I was tempted to try the cool looking bloody Caesars which many there were enjoying out of large mason jars topped with a fun garnish of lettuce.  While other restaurants try to pack in as many seats as they can to make the most revenue, I really appreciate how spread out and spacious this restaurant feels -- you could have a great conversation without hearing other tables or worry about annoying others. 

I especially like the wall of glass on one side which overlooks the GO train tracks which you get occasional trains passing by which is a neat sight but not loud or obtrusive at all. The other side of the restaurant is a modern open kitchen which is also pleasant to watch and it is surprisingly OCD-level neat, clean, orderly and very quiet.
This restaurant is what I picture my dream loft to be!

The prix-fixe dinner was 4-courses but felt almost like 8-courses as it was presented family style with a number of accompanied side courses.
The first course was an italian bread soup which was uniquely served by the waitress from a large tea pot into a bowl of croutons and shaved cheese. The chicken broth was simple but very flavourful.

Michael which I assume was the manager visited our table on a couple occasions to ask about the food was very friendly and made sure we are well taken care of. Also our waitress made sure our water glasses were constantly filled eventhough there was a bottle of water on our table, and was extremely friendly and attentive.

Second course came a bowl of Caesar salad, a plate of crab cakes and bowl of ricotta gnudi. While Caesar salad was nice, it could use a little more punch of seasoning like pepper and garlic, but the crab cakes was very flavourful and well cooked though I wished for a little more of the creamy sweet chili sauce, and the ricotta gnudi was rich and tasty as it featured three forms of dairy-goodness (soft ricotta filling, browned butter sauce, and shaved cheese) with a nice tasty garnish of fried sage and lime zest. The three dishes of this appetizer really complemented each other.

The main course featured a plate of pan fried salmon on a bed of sweet roasted root veggies, a plate of grilled sirloin strips topped with wine sauteed sweet onions and savoury aioli which is the perfect dipping sauce for the bowl of frites.

And for dessert was profitteroles stuffed with chocolate gelatto and topped with chocolate and caramel sauce. While it sounds rich and we were all very stuffed from the previous courses, it actually felt light and was a nice finish to the meal.

The prix-fixe meal was offered with an optional wine or beer pairing which at $27 for the wine flight was a great deal and the wines were nicely chosen. Wines by the glass in comparison was about $10-12/glass and pours for them were on the meek side.

This was a great meal and a nice relaxing night, and I will definitely return again. 
Thank you MTK for an excellent night!"}
{"text":"Insane wait time which when we were told it would be 1.5 hrs we were about to walk out but the desk girl quickly said \"it may be much less... Come back in 45 mins\". I should have known that was BS. Make a long story short we waited 2 hrs. When we walk in we realize this place is HUGE and could easily fit another 5-10 tables without making things uncomfortable. 

We order a juice and cappuccino right away which took 15 mins to come and I'm brought a regular coffee instead. In the mean time we had ordered breakfast. These \"amazing pancakes\" and something else.  It literally took 1 hr from the time we sat down. Insane... 

The pancakes weren't even fluffy. Actually they were glorified biscuits.  

Wayyyyyyyy overrated. 3 stars is being generous."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and we got the Gnocci Poutine as an appetizer, and a burger & steak for dinner. Everything was cooked to perfection and they certainly know how to make consistency a core competency within their restaurant.  The staff was extremely nice and the restaurant was exceptionally clean.  Parking was relatively cheap for the area (Liberty Village) and the washroom was different but cool with an 'air plane' theme paired with airport noises playing as background noise."}
{"text":"Great. Only drawback is the wait time.
Came here during Xmas when there was no lineup so it was a very enjoyable experience. Food is great as everyone is saying!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends. Our food took quite a long time to come out, and looked like they had been under a heat lamp for some time. I got the pancakes which were lukewarm by the time it was served. The pancakes are really fluffy but are not served with enough maple syrup (they are kind of dry).

Our server was lovely and the food was still good."}
{"text":"Came here after work on a Tuesday night and really enjoyed the meal. I tried the gnocchi poutine with oxtail gravy as a starter and it was pretty good. For my main, I had the steak on a bed of warm salad and it was well cooked and very flavourful. Our server was pretty attentive. Its a nice restaurant in a nice area. The decor is on the upscale side, but I found the prices reasonable. 
Would definitely like to check out the brunch."}
{"text":"Helloooo Millie. What a gorgeous, airy and wondrous resto in Liberty Village. Named for a James M. Cain novel (or possibly the film), you can't visit here without noting the spectacular decor and furnishings. It was definitely a site for sore eyes when I rolled in here on Sunday afternoon at 2pm, an hour before brunch was done. 

We were seated right away, but this turned out to be a red herring. In some brunch spots in Toronto you wait for ages on the street before you are seated; here you wait for ages in your seat before you are served. This is something would-be diners should always note: just because a seat is empty at a restaurant, doesn't mean that there is staff available to fulfill its demands. We kept our appetites at bay with sips of their tasty coffee.

I was pretty excited for our meals. My date ordered Veda's Choice ($14), which was poached eggs and smoked salmon on a croissant. I went for the Huevos Monty ($14), their take on Huevos Rancheros. Kind of pricy, but certainly worth the wait. I've heard lesser tales of their dinner fare, but I would return to find out.

Obligatory Title Pun: Not a run-of-the-MILL brunch spot.

Menu Readability: Everything a menu should be, peppered with cute references to the film. (Not that I understood any of them.)

Need to mention: Parking in the adjacent lot was SO expensive. 

What this place teaches me about myself: Maybe I should rent Mildred Pierce."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. I keep going back all the time. The food is so fresh, the service is superb, and atmosphere fits for dates, group celebrations or even dining alone."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!! 

I had to find the perfect spot for brunch while I was on there. And I'm so happy that I decided to choose this place. Sure, the wait be long, but it's totally worth it. 

The service was wonderful! We had an awesome server and she gave us her opinions on what was the best meal to get. And of course I got their well-known Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes, trust me it was soo good!! I wish it was here. My Verde's choice and she loved it! The place was well designed and there was a lot of space, so no one was sitting on top of one another. 

I also bought a T-Shirt as well, it was super cute!! If you live in Toronto or just visiting, you must try it out for yourself!!"}
{"text":"Food and drink: Brunch is my favourite meal of the day, and Mildred's is my favourite brunch place in Toronto! The blueberry pancakes are heavenly (coming from someone who doesn't typically love pancakes) - they are thick and fluffy, and the whipped cream and blueberry topping pair perfectly! I also love the grilled cheese - the apple relish on it balances the saltiness of the cheese very well. The drip coffee is also delicious!

Service and atmosphere: Expect a bit of a wait on Saturday mornings (got there at ~10:00 and waited ~20 minutes for a table for 2). I love the seating area with the large windows and lots of natural light as well as modern decor."}
{"text":"Most ultimate restaurant for a lovely lunch with girlfriend (and babies or not), friends, colleagues or clients. The space is big so you are not side by side with another table. The service is always impeccable, the food divine, and ou HAVE TO try the pancakes as a dessert (ask for a smaller portion if you can't do the full dish;-)"}
{"text":"Mildred's a place that I have been thinking of trying for a while.  They're known for their lovely pancakes - and I knew that I had to make a trip over to Liberty Village.  My friend and I went at 1PM on Saturday - and we had to wait about 20-25 minutes.  This, in my opinion, was less busy that I expected.  The interior is spacious with high ceilings and wonderful modern d√©cor.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere, definitely one of the more upscale-looking brunch places around the city.  

We were sat down and offered water immediately.  I got my coffee, which was fairly garden-variety.  Not much to write home about.  We placed our order and our food came in 15-20 minutes.  I personally got the Big Brunch Skillet, which had pulled pork, beans, potatoes, and a sunny side up egg.  My friend and I decided to share the blueberry pancakes as well.

The Brunch Skillet had a nice kick to it - it was definitely like there was a fiesta in my mouth.  It was flavourful, but if I did not have the Blueberry Pancakes to balance the taste, I think I would be bored of the salsa-filled brunch.  However, with the blueberry pancakes, it was a perfect contrast.  It was an above average dish, but I likely would not choose this next time.  

The blueberry pancakes were really great - it was less fluffy than I thought.  It was very much the consistency of a light scone.  The buttermilk taste was great, soaked in a lightly sweetened syrup.  The blueberry sauce and the whipped cream made the dish.  I was a little sad that there was not enough blueberry and whipped cream for us to last through all 3 pancakes.  It was pretty clear why people raved about their pancakes.  Definitely a great choice.  And I'm not even a pancake type of guy! 

Overall: nice atmosphere, good food, amazing pancakes. A very solid 4/5 from me!"}
{"text":"I didn't think the pancakes would be filling so I got the huevos Monty. Both were really filling. They look like little portions but they aren't. Pancakes were the best thing I've had so far! Amazing atmosphere as well. Servers are so polite and attentive."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to post this for a while - I love this spot. Ceaser's are fabulous - and so are the pancakes. Such a great spot for lunch/brunch - and hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Came here for b'lunch with my sister today. When we walked in, we noticed right away how cold the restaurant was. We were seated promptly and I already loved the atmosphere with the open kitchen and the comfy seating. Our server, Pablo, was very nice, patient and good with the timing of everything. He also got us blankets when he saw we still had our jackets on. We ordered the black current scone to start and then we both got Veda's choice: sister got the bacon option and I got the salmon option. The salmon was slightly too salty for my taste and masked the other flavours but it was still good. The poached eggs were not too overcooked, which often happens at many restaurants. The bathrooms were also clean and interesting, as they played a recording of airline safety instructions. All things considered, I had a good experience and  am looking forward to going back to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Not recommended. We had a reservation for dinner for groupon for 2, but we ended up waiting over 30 minutes to be seated. Once seated, we waited 40 minutes more to get the appetizer and another 40 minutes to receive the main dish. The food was disappointing as well, the espresso ice cream desert was probably the best that we had that night. When you go to a place like this, you have a certain expectation and this place doesn't cut it. With all of the restaurant choices in the city, it is very hard to recommend this place. I prefer Boiler House in Distillery District. The food is better and it's run much more efficiently. In contrast, the staff and the food at Mildred seems amateurish in comparison."}
{"text":"I went to Mildred's Temple Kitchen for brunch on a weekend, thankfully I got in early enough before the crowd hit. 

I noticed on many of the staff shirts that there were a stack of pancakes so I figured this must be something they're known for and ordered the pancakes. I was not disappointed! This was the tallest, fluffiest stack of pancakes I have ever had. I can't remember what life was like before tasting these pancakes. I have dreams about how delicious they were! 

I can not wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and I have to say I am now a fan! I have never tried better pancakes than the ones here at Mildred's, and will definitely come back to have them again. I came here with 2 of my friends, and we each ordered something different and shared the pancakes (it came in a plate of 3).  I had the daily special which was a sunnyside up egg with beef brisket and potatoes, one of my friends had the classic salmon croissant which was delicious, and my other friend went for a basic granola and fruit bowl.  I have to say, if you are coming here you have to try the salmon croissant because it is awesome, but it is not that filling on its own.  The beef brisket and egg was great as well.  As for the granola bowl, we all agreed that it was not worth the money compared to the other stuff you get on the menu.  One thing we all loved was the fat and fluffy pancakes with the whip cream and blueberries. 

Overall, good food...TRY THE PANCAKES!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night with a reservation for Winterlicious. Service was really good and they were very accommodating even though we were about 15 minutes late. It was also great throughout the night. I started with the lobster bisque, then had the braised beef cheek, and the bread pudding. My friend had chicken liver parfait, duck and waffles, and the profiteroles. I really liked the lobster bisque and duck and waffles. I didn't quite like the braised beef cheek and thought that the portion was small compared to the duck and waffles. Everything else was good, but not amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice now. Once for Winterlicious 2017 and once this past Sunday for brunch.


WINTERLICIOUS - $38 prix fixe menu
Even with reservations we waited about 20 minutes to be seated.  The service, although friendly, was a bit slow on this evening and we didn't get seated till about 9pm.

We ordered:
Roasted Beets Salad and Famous Crab Cakes - both were delicious. The salad was fresh and had good flavour. The crab cakes were crunchy and also flavourful.
Duck and Waffles as one main - my husband was a little disappointed. He said the duck was good but the waffles were a bit soggy. All in all, said he wouldn't order it again and I use that as a good indication if someone truly enjoyed their food.
Braised Beef Short Rib - I ordered this and it did not disappoint. It was tasty and soft and the large portion of beef showed great value in the money spent. I would definitely order this item again if it popped up on a future Winterilicious menu.
For dessert we ordered the Churros and White Chocolate Cheesecake. Churros were good but the cheesecake was not really memorable.

SUNDAY BRUNCH
Really long wait. Showed up at 12pm, told it was a 1 hour and 40 minute wait but didn't get seated until about 2pm. By this time we had done all the walking and shopping in Liberty Village that we intended to do and even still the wait felt like forever. 

We ordered:
Scone and biscuits to start - both were flaky, filling and delicious with the butter and jam.

Our mains:
We wanted to order the Big Brunch Skillet but sadly they had run out. So alternatively, we ordered the Huevos Monty - my husband was disappointed unfortunately. Although the flavour was fine he didn't find it satisfying after the long wait.

I ordered the famous Mrs. Biederhof's Legendary Light & Fluffy Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes - there were fluffy 3 pancakes stacked high and although they looked amazing, they tasted just fine. I couldn't find anything outstanding about them and I actually had to ask for more syrup because I found it to be a little dry. Also, we were told that people usually order pancakes for the table and share it which sounded like a cash grab until I realized that other tables only ordered 1 pancake to share and then another dish as their main. It would have been nice to know that we could have ordered just 1 pancake because otherwise, this plate of pancakes costed a steep $16.

Overall, dinner was great but I had high expectations for brunch that fell short. Service for the most part was good on both occasions - really friendly staff which I appreciate.  But for brunch, it definitely didn't feel like it was worth the 2 hour long wait. I do think I would return to this restaurant to try other things on the menu but only if the wait time is shorter than 45 minutes."}
{"text":"Its hidden away in liberty village area but the inside has great aesthetics. It's got an open concept kind of design and feel. There's usually a wedding going on during the weekend and I can totally see why. The ceilings are high enough, with large and tall windows to give lots of natural light. This place is a great spot for brunch with the girls or a date, or any event. 

The waitress that helped our table was knowledgable about the menu and gave us her honest opinion on what to get. My friend and I both ended up getting the Veda (one with smoked salon and one with bacon). You can also get a blueberry pancake on the side, and it can be made savory or sweet! 

Unfortunately, my friend and I both felt a little 'off' when we had left and walked to our next destination afterwards. Not sure if it was the poached egg or the croissant but we both had digestive issues so that wasnt the most pleasant for our first time visit. 

Although the inside is fabulously designed and is a great opportunity for pictures, I'm not sure if I'd come again simply because I didn't think the brunch was as good as it's hyped up to be."}
{"text":"I was looking for a breakfast place with a dog-friendly patio and came across Mildred's. Having heard of Mildred's being a popular brunch place, I decided to beat the rush and go there for breakfast.

We got there around 930AM on Sunday and was seated at the patio immediately. The best part about this place is the service. Even when the restaurant was busy, our coffee and water was always topped up. The waitress came by and noticed our dog tied to the gate and left a dog bowl of water for him which was a very kind and appreciated gesture. 

For two people, we ordered the salmon croissant and the blueberry buttermilk pancakes and both were delicious and extremely filling - the pancakes were extra fluffy. 

We'll definitely be back for their dog-friendly patio and delicious food!"}
{"text":"The food was good the waiter was dumb but super nice. The pancakes are sweet and there are so many I could eat for a week.  Overall not to shabby"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here saying they had the best pancakes the world could offer. Well, they surely did not disappoint. The whole lunch/brunch was wonderful. You may need to wait for an hour or so, but definitely worth it. 

The service was also amazing giving the fact their were extremely busy. Shout-out to our waitress Jennie, she made us feel pretty special."}
{"text":"The service and decor are truly magical here (speaking of magic, actually locating this place requires a bit of sorcery - it's so hidden you'd almost think they don't want you to find it). 

However, the prices are oppressive and the food to cost ratio is bonkers in a Tom Cruise-on-a-couch sorta way. I ordered a bowl of Italian Wedding Soup that matched neither the description of \"wedding soup\" nor the price point ($7 as I recall): five croutons and two pieces of wilted kale in a clear broth (that I poured over the items myself). I think I must have ordered the wrong thing but I'm not rushing to return to find out."}
{"text":"Nicole was an amazing server.  She made the visit perfect.  Food here is always wonderful.  Cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.  Fresh juices are perfect.  Love me some scones. The Veda is mmmmmm. Can't wait to come back again"}
{"text":"I went there with a few others for shared plates and cocktails. Cocktail selections are outstanding and the oxtail poutine blew me away. I love how the bathrooms are solo with airline safety audio playing!"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch yesterday after reading all the raving reviews. We knew the wait was going to be an hour, which is fine if the food is worth waiting an hour for.  The food was really good, but there are much better places for brunch on weekends with much shorter wait times, or no wait at all. 

The decor is really nice, and the service was friendly. The 3 stars come from the fact that this place is WAY too hyped for what it is. Its good, but it doesn't have me wanting to come back and wait an hour for brunch again. My boyfriend had the veda's choice, which was Mildred's take on an eggs benny. He said it was good, but he didn't think he would wait an hour again for it. He said for example, the eggs benny at Stoney's bread company was a lot better, half the price and at a minimal wait."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I am a little obsessed with brunch, and I really don't think I eat it enough! So after hearing many great things about brunch at Mildred's Temple Kitchen's, I finally tried it for myself!

I've read rave reviews about Mildred's famous scones, so naturally we ordered some for the table to share. For $12, you get to pick between currant scones and buttermilk biscuits (6 in total), so because I've heard so much about the scones, we only had one biscuit for our platter. Unfortunately, I have to say I was quite disappointed with these scones. I wished they had been served warmer, and the accompanying preserve wasn't spectacular either. Maybe I came on an off day? On the contrary, I quite enjoyed the buttermilk biscuits and wished we ordered more of that instead. 

A couple of friends ordered Veda's Choice ($14.5)- Mildred's classic poached eggs on a flakey croissant with your choice of smoked salmon or rosemary bacon, topped with B√©arnaise sauce and served with mixed green. I was tempted to order this for myself and from the bite I had, I really liked it! 

Huevos Monty ($14.5) was a surprise hit for me: Mildred's classic black bean refritos and sharp cheddar cheese, baked in flour tortillas and topped with eggs sunny, fresh salsa and avocado cr√®me fra√Æche. Normally, I'm not a huge fan of black beans, but the flavour combination here was really delicious! I would definitely consider ordering this for myself next time I come.  

But from the very beginning, I had very little doubt that I was going for Mrs. Biederhof's Infamous Light & Fluffy Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes ($13.5) served with Lanark County maple syrup and whipped cream. Light and fluffy are indeed the perfect words to describe these beauties, and they would most certainly rank amongst the best pancakes I've ever had! Thinking about it is making me hungry right now! On a side note, it was also extremely filling (I think I fell into a coma after I finished one), so sharing is highly recommended! Nevertheless, they were absolutely amazing and I had no regrets! 

If you're looking for something a little heartier, then perhaps consider the Manhandler ($19)- sliced striploin steak on arugula and garlic toasted sourdough topped with two eggs sunnyside up, and served with horseradish jus. This was my boyfriend's order, so I got to eat all of his side salad, which was actually really yummy- loved the bright acidity of the tangy dressing! 

All in all, I thought everything at brunch was pretty fabulous, with the exception of the scones. The verdict? Pancakes are a definite must-order, and I can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Ok so I was back again this year for winterlicious 2015, and I will be honest, it was a bit disappointing..

The menu was pretty much identical to last years, but didn't mind ordering the duck tacos again. BUT this time for some reason the duck tasted gooey and raw and smelled funny...hmm not sure what happened here 'cause I really liked it last year. 

Dessert was pretty boring. Cookies or affogato (no option for non-dairy) 
And my mom had the banana chocolate mousse thingy (I hate bananas) but she said it tastes super sweet.

Cookies came in a sealed plastic bag. 
Hmm...maybe it would've been nice to at least have it nicely on a plate or something. 
I feel like they lacked in effort overall.

3 stars for friendly staff and the soup and salad appetizer was great. 

Would be nice to have non-dairy options."}
{"text":"After several attempts to have brunch here and getting a table at School a lot quicker, I finally had the chance to grab a quick brunch here a few weeks ago! I came at 9AM on a Sunday thinking it won't be busy yet but boy was I wrong.

Asked for a table of 2 and the hostess said she could seat us at the bar in 10 minutes if we didn't mind. 10 minutes? While there was several other groups still waiting? Of course I'd take up that offer! So she took down our name and number in her tablet and we moved aside and waited. 10 minutes passed, then 15, then 20, and I was getting unbearably hungry I asked the hostess what happened to our seats - turns out she forgot. Not a good impression at all - had we not followed up with her who knows how long we would've stood there waiting?! She then got another hostess to seat us at a regular table a couple of minutes after. 

Anyway, I love the dining atmosphere here, very bright, spacious, and relaxing. I had their famous buttermilk pancakes and a cup of London fog. I love that they have an open kitchen concept near the center so you can see them plating out heaps and heaps of pancakes - though very bad idea to watch if you're starving! The pancakes were heavenly - light, fluffy, and a very small crisp near the sides. However, I'm a bit conflicted, as I've also had similar pancakes at School just down the street, and both of them were equally as good and I can't tell the difference.

I'll definitely be putting my name down for both places again next time and seeing which place opens up a spot first for me to brunch but to help me (and others) out a bit - I'd say I'd come to Mildred's for a more refined brunch experience with probably family or a nice date. Whereas I'd go to School for a nice hangout with friends. I'd like to come back to Mildred's again though and try other items off their brunch menu!"}
{"text":"Went here for a weekend brunch. I would say go early or else risk the line up. They open at 9am and I got there for 9:30am which was pretty empty. But by 10am or a little after the place is packed!

In terms of the food, it was good and decent size proportions. I got the special of the day which had a jalape√±o corn bread and it had some kick to it. 

Service was excellent and friendly. The environment was nice.

I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't  for the cleanliness. For a place like this I expected the place to be a little cleaner. Crumbs seems to be everywhere."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is vegan, which is obviously his fault, but I like to find places he can eat so he doesn't have to sit there and watch me gnaw on a steak bone. So when we got to Toronto and settled in at our AirBnb, Yelp suggested this place as a nearby \"vegetarian\" spot. Let me warn you: this is vegetarian friendly if you are the kind of vegetarian who eats dairy, eggs and clams, all of which I totally support, but I did feel bad for my boyfriend who had to make a meal of a side of potatoes. (They were great, though.) The biscuits and biscuit paraphernalia were awesome (together they inspired the hashtag #sogoodiwannacry) and we learned that a Caesar is a Bloody Mary with clam juice, which is apparently what all Bloody Marys are missing. I also ordered a side of bacon, just to rub it in my boyfriend's face a little, and it was a LOT of bacon. And that's coming from a bacon-loving American. I couldn't even finish it all. As our cute waiter said, Tuck in!"}
{"text":"We've been here 4-5 times now in the last month and I think it's fair to write a review now. The food is excellent. Well seasoned and prepared. It tastes fresh. Presentation never fails to impress and I always leave full. So far I've tried the Wednesday, Thursday and Friday specials. Each of them came with a free homemade cookie (different flavor each time) and was a regular menu item offered at a lower price. The skillet, manhandler and burger were all awesome! Try dipping your fries in some of their delicious MP sauce. Great for lunch and big groups, or a private lunch for two."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch place. Highly recommend their pancake.  I also had Huevos which is basically baked bean and cheese sandwiched between tortillas and topped with two sunny side up eggs.  They were both delicious but the blueberry pancake was the most memorable.  It was very thick and textured somewhere in between scone and butter pancake - excellent.  The interior was very fancy and well decorated; however the service was really slow and it took us almost 25 min to get our bill from the moment we asked.  And it was quite pricy for breakfast.  An interesting side note is that they play pre-recorded air plane take off and landing instruction in the bathroom.  It was bit odd but my friend told me that some people have sex there (make them feel like having sex in air plane bathroom).  I dont know if it is real but sounded a little disgusting to hear that."}
{"text":"We originally wanted to go to School on Fraser Ave, but the wait time (which we've been warned) was 55 minutes, so we decided to walk to Mildred's and try our luck there. Once we got there, we're told that the wait time was 45 minutes, so we stayed and waited. The place was closing in early because they had a wedding to host at 5pm. We're one of the last tables on their waiting list, which worried us that they would rush our meal to get us out of there!

45 minutes later...

We're the last couple to be seated. Our server, Machael, attended to us immediately. He's friendly and full of energy, which we appreciated especially during the last hour before they closed the place. We ordered a scone and a biscuit as starters (2 for $6 or 6 for $14), Veda's Choice with bacon, and the blueberry buttermilk pancake. Machael promised us that he'd get the starters out right away. We waited 20 minutes for our mains but no sign of the starters. When we asked him about them, he admitted that he had forgotten about them and apologized to us. He was gone for 5 minutes then came back with a plate of 2 scone & 2 biscuits PLUS a box of scones & biscuits for us to take home ALL ON THE HOUSE. Way to go, Machael! His excellent customer service really made our day, especially after waiting for a total of an hour to get our food. My Veda's Choice was very yummy. I normally don't go for poached eggs, but this was an exception. The croissant \"bun\" was buttery and flakey, the bacon was plentiful, and the hollandaise sauce complimented the sandwich perfectly. Even the side salad was delicious. I wonder how they made the dressing, haha! But the star of our brunch was my boyfriend's Blueberry Pancake. Dear Lord, it's the best pancake I've ever had! It's thicker than a normal pancake, but it tasted lighter than it looked. The edge was crispy, almost like a scone, but the centre was fluffy, just like a pancake. HOW DID YOU GUYS DO THAT?!?! The cream and the blueberry sauce were divine. The sweetness was just right. He licked the plate clean ;)

Overall, we enjoyed our experience at Mildred's and will definitely come back to try their lunch and dinner menu. Thanks to Machael for an excellent brunch experience! :)"}
{"text":"I was not too impressed by this place.  I ordered the two items they had for the likes of me:  Bread and Olives and Curried Cauliflower.  The bread was good and the white bean spread that came with it was tasty but it was very, very little of it.  The Cauliflower was plentiful but it tasted really strange.  I did not get a lot of the curry flavor.  If I got a bite that had caramelized onion then it tasted good.  Otherwise it was very bitter and, again, just strange.  My husband ordered the warm beet salad, which he enjoyed and the extremly tiny Great Lakes Pickerel.  I thought it was another appetizer when they brought it in.  All 28 dollars of it.  He said it tasted bland and he rarely complains about food.  He also had the bread pudding for dessert which the waitress had told him would \"change your life\" and he was not particularly amazed by it.
Service was good. Decor was fun.  I like their logo.  Just not enough to go back."}
{"text":"The blueberry pancakes is a must try. I'm not a pancake fan because I find them dry and hard but the pancakes at Mildred's were really fluffy and good!"}
{"text":"*I am only speaking about their brunch menu*

Mildred's Temple Kitchen is your typical example of millennial hype and glamorized food popularized via Instagram filters and silly 'Boomerang' special effects.

I am, admittedly, a skeptic when it comes to new, trendy, stylized or social media popular 'must do's'. Mildred's Temple (brunch) is the epitome of Brunch Douchebaggery. 

Long gone are the days of being known and recommended for reasons like great customer service, exceptional quality of ingredients and execution of the plate. Now, a few Facebook posts with pretty people and filters will suffice.

Service was typical at a restaurant that clearly thinks itself to be AMAZING. Our server was nice albeit rarely around. Our table of 5 got our coffees and teas quick however there was a half hour + before we seen our food. I believe the kitchen forgot or didn't receive our order which makes sense why our server didn't show their face. 
Now before you read and think 'Half hour + isn't bad' , keep in mind other tables seated after us received their food before us thus proving our order was lost.

The food was... well, it tried. 
Mixing ingredients to be edgy or trendy can work when done correctly. Unfortunately, Mildred's Temple missed the bus on this one.

The portion for price wasn't too bad although it was leaning more towards the pricey side.

Lastly, because I'm tired as I am writing this, nowadays for some reason you need a 'thing' to be known for and famous with. Apparently it's their pancakes. Yes, pancakes... the most basic thing anyone can make in any kitchen or home around the world.

They are thick, colourfully plated with fruit and sprinkled in icing sugar. Wooo Hooo!!
Visually they are captivating and immediately capture your attention. Eating them they are basic, dry and completely unappetizing."}
{"text":"A friend i use to trust for food recommended  this place as one of the best brunch in town... Let's now say i do not even dare telling this friend what i thought! 
After waiting exactly one full hour to be allowed to enter the... \"Temple\" It finally boiled down to a slice of (sourdough yes! I ll give you that!) bread with a little non seasoned steak on top of it and two eggs sunny side up poorly cooked and again not seasoned. With a side salad, the mixed green type you find at no frills!
Not only \"that\" cost about 15$, but you are mesmerized by why the place is full!!
My only explanation is the interior design... Maybe? Torontonians can be weird in that respect, at least the ones willing to queue up two times for very lame snobby bad dinner food!"}
{"text":"It was OK but I expected more. The bartender at the front wouldn't serve the lounge tables so I went to the bar. 10 minutes in he hadn't even acknowledged that I was standing there...and while he seemed busy he was still doing tasks like putting glasses away, wiping up, etc. Once in, the waitress was awesome, the food was OK. The main disappointment was discovering, as we were walking out, that there was still 1/2 bottle of our wine left which they kept off our table and never poured. We had a group of 10 and 4 bottles total so we wouldn't know...but I thought that was a little lame. Overall, OK, but there's lots of better places to eat."}
{"text":"Good, but pricey brunch.

Went once (husband had a gift card) and we spent about $60 for breakfast. This is a special brunch, not a typical thing.

Forget what I had (it was a couple years ago now), but it was perfectly fine. I was not blown away. I would give it a solid 70%, but it does not allow that.

Sat on patio which was nice."}
{"text":"We all know that this place has the best pancakes in the city if you disagree please let me know,  iv been here a couple of times the food is top notch, but the servers are very rude and not pleasant .it's very busy on a Sunday brunch, it's at least 40min  to 1hour wait for a table, I would of given this place a 5 star if it had better FOH staff. It's always worth a try you will not be disappointed by the food!!"}
{"text":"The environment is lovely, the pancakes are out-of-this-world amazing!  However the wait times and staff efficiency is simply terrible."}
{"text":"I love Mildred's but I hate waiting in line (with no reservation option - hence the 4 star). Their blueberry pancakes are AMAZING! I am also a fan of their eggs Benedict. Scones are yummy too and come with different jams for sharing. Portion sizes are ok for me but on the smaller size for hungry dudes. The restaurant is pretty and open (aka: kid and stroller friendly)."}
{"text":"Absolutely love it here!! This fancy brunch place is located in liberty village and it definitely lived up to the reviews and the hype. 

The food was great! I tried the famous buttermilk blueberry pancakes and the brunch special for the day which was 2 poached eggs, salad, and 2 salmon fish cakes. The pancakes were SO GOOD. My first bite of the pancakes with the blueberries, syrup, and whipped cream had me making unnatural noises. I definitely recommend this dish and I think it's worth the $16 price. The serving size of 3 pancakes is quite big. I was able to finish most of it but I'd definitely share this dish next time. The brunch of the day was decent. The brunch of the day is priced at $14 - I didn't think this particular dish was worth the price since the portions weren't that large.. especially the salad which was a dinky portion. I also tried the OJ mimosa - this was delicious but I don't think the price of $9.50 is worth it for the amount you get. 

The service was excellent. We didn't make reservations prior to coming in for brunch on Saturday but we were still seated despite coming so close to closing. TIP: MAKE SURE YOU MAKE RESERVATIONS. The place closes at 3:00pm on weekends and typically still accepts customers until 2:30pm. 

The establishment is super nice and clean with lots of natural light and nice furniture. 

I'd definitely come back. I want to try the other food and drink items on the menu.. And ofcourse get more of those blueberry pancakes!"}
