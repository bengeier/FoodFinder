{"text":"If you like medium thick crust pizza you will like the pizza here. Many of my friends just love it.  Have been going here regularly, like a couple of times a week, for over 12 years. Nice homey local pub feel, lots of regulars, and reasonable priced drinks. Food is great for a pub, or any restaurant and most dishes are a real deal.   They serve a Steak sandwich, with fires for $8.95. Cheaper than most burgers and it is as good a steak as you will get in any high end steak house in Calgary. Maybe not quite Ceasar's but they kick the Keg and Nick's big time.  We were usually the only ones in suits because we go there from work, but never felt uncomfortable, service is quick and friendly as are the regulars. Not where you take your girl for a romantic dinner but for wings and a game it is a great place.  Highly recommend the steak sandwich, dry ribs, onion rings and wings as real standouts."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 Service: 3/5 Overall experience: 3/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  Normally, I would turn a blind eye to this dive-like bar, but my coworkers brought me here for lunch; it was their 1/2 off medium or large pizza special every Wednesday. Great deal for tasty pizzas if you like a medium thick crust (a 10\" medium normally costs ~$15).   You can choose from various toppings which they load onto the pizza; I decided to get the Stolo's Special with beef, pepperoni, shrimp, onions, bell peppers, olives, and mushrooms. The pizzas came out fairly quickly, piping hot with a light and crispy crust.   Unless you have a big appetite, a medium can be shared with someone else without feeling overly full. Our server was sub-par, and the atmosphere was relaxed with the bar's regulars.  If you live or work in the area, I recommend trying Stolo's pizza for their 1/2 off special."}
{"text":"Well... the atmosphere on a Thursday night leading up to a long weekend was a dud.  This was my first visit and I was disappointed.  Only a local radio station was playing as background noise and I could count on two hands how many people were in the bar.  It's kind of outdated and unfortunate.  I was surprised to see VLT's and of course they were in use.    My spouse and I had heard the pizza was good so we went for it.  We ended up ordering a large half and half, trialing the Double Double (lots of pepperoni, mushrooms and cheese) and the Spicy Italian (lots of meat).  The pizza was hearty and I liked the crust, but we both thought it was too salty.  I realize the ingredients wouldn't have helped, but it was shockingly salty.  This disappointed me too.    The only really great thing about Stolo's was the service.  There actually was only one woman playing both bartender and server, but she was absolutely lovely and on the ball.  Unfortunately, this just isn't enough to make me want to return."}
