{"text":"Love the atmosphere .. old time diner decor. I've been coming here on and off for years. Some food is good and some not but there's lots to choose from. My son swears this is the best burger he's ever tried (and we go burger hunting). He also loves the fries and milkshakes. I love the all day breakfast. My other son craves the pancakes that smell oh so good."}
{"text":"This place has some fantastic food for some really decent prices. The sizes are perfect and the decoration is great for a diner. I love the old school pictures on the wall and the fact that they have a large number of booths available. It would honestly give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the semi-decent service. I understand, they were busy. Then again, 'Cora's' is always busy and the servers always find the time to smile. I'll still come back though to satisfy my Eggs Benedict craving. It's cheaper and tastes better :)"}
{"text":"It's a dive diner...a mom n pop shop. Went there for breakfast, good size portions, friendly service and not too pricey. Went back a couple weeks later for a burger and fires. The burger was okay nothing too amazing. They did give a lot of fries. I haven't tried anything else, but ill differently go back for breakfast tho!"}
{"text":"Had an impromptu dinner here with the family based on yelp reviews - it did not disappoint!  Service was wonderful and the food was pretty tasty.  The liver and onions was great and the banquet burger was quite good as well."}
{"text":"You ever around the Allen and Shepard? Need a diner? Could do worse than that. Great clubhouse sandwich and chocolate milk."}
{"text":"Loved this gem!  Not a gourmet place and nary a hipster to be found, but old-school diner food with SUPER friendly family atmosphere. Club sandwich had actual roasted turkey breast, portions were generous, kids options were great and other than the Miracle Whip-esque mayo (yuck!) we loved our lunch.  It's a bit out of the way and the strip mall location feels a bit sketchy, but once you're inside it's friendly, inviting, kitschy, and the staff were really great.   Definitely will go back when we're near Yorkdale or recovering from a Costco trip."}
{"text":"Worst diner ever, waited for 40 minutes and realized that they haven't even started making our food. Some of the customers who got there after us had already started eating. We asked the waiter/ waitresses politely to follow up on our order for two eggs bunnies through out, we get waitresses avoiding us, telling us \"you ll get it when it's ready\" or \"you came at a busy time\". We paid for our orange juices and got out of there, with them having attitudes at us as we walked out."}
{"text":"You'd be surprised! That a little dingy diner like this could serve up such a tasty eggs Benedict! Top notch. The egg has been perfectly cooked everything I've ordered it! 5 stars for the quality Benedict and for its value.   Other than that good breakfast food basics at very fair price and super efficient service.   My only complaints are that their hash brown is plain and unimpressive - just deep fried potatoes (no seasoning or fried onions, green peppers etc), and that their coffee is diluted like Tim Horton's.    I'm still a big fan though!"}
{"text":"The food is generally ok. Large portions. The staff could lose the attitude already....so over that!"}
{"text":"I ordered the western sandwich it was very good. The last time I went I ordered the eggs with corned beef hash...it was tasty."}
{"text":"I liked the laid back 50's diner atmosphere. The portions were big and the all day breakfasts are cheap and tasty! The chocolate milkshake is the best I've ever had!!!  I will definitely be back for more!! I'm glad I discovered this place! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a definite gem in the city. It has amazing breakfast meals and lovely staff creating a friendly environment. Im a regular there and am never disappointed w the food. It has a very comfortable and homey vibe and reminds me of a typical 50s diner. Portions are huge so go here with a big appetite, you definitely get a good bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Food was hot and fresh. Omelette was a little on greasy side. Good home fries. Decor a little tired but acceptable. Service was great"}
{"text":"Ok, tried again, and I can only go 3 stars. Fries are SO bad, and the gravy is really weak, but thank goodness the burger is so good, or it would be 1 star or less :)  Had a decent, large toasted western and another solid burger - the $8 \"Canadian burger\", but recommend just sticking with the cheeseburger, because despite being a thick slice the peameal bacon was flavourless and will be skipped next time.  Another pet peeve is that sauteed onions cost an extra $1.50 which is kinda chintzy on a regular base cheeseburger that's already $6 alone with no sides.  SO, I'll probably be back for a cheeseburger and onion rings, but I will pout about not being able to pair it with fries & gravy due to their crappy fries, and my pricey fried onions, despite enjoying the burger.  Cheers, .James."}
{"text":"Excellent greasy spoon joint for Sunday morning breakfast. They've got a good selection of egg, pancake and French toast combos. They make their burgers from scratch so I decided to try the smothered burger, topped with caramelized onions and cheese, for $8. You have to get a side of fries separately. The rest of my friends ordered breakfast items so I just ate their home fries, which are crispy and a very generous serving.  There's plenty of space for groups and you can also make reservations ahead of time."}
{"text":"Little wait to get seated, and served a menu but its nothing major. Order was quick, pretty filling for a big breakfast, I had few piece of peameal bacon, one egg and some home fries left. I did finish it but for a meal to stuff me is good.  The decor had that 60 look because it been around that long or Atleast I think so. Run by greek family I think but all and all a good experience  Thou I could barely fit in booth, bad idea. The decor is off setting but its good for the food. Add another yelp find to the list"}
{"text":"I'm from New York, but in Canada frequently and always looking for new places to enjoy a meal with whomever I visit. After hearing that this establishment is openly homophobic, I know to take my and my friends' business elsewhere. It's 2018 and the staff here is asking gay people to move to other parts of the restaurant so as not to be seen? You all should be ashamed of yourselves."}
{"text":"Probably a bit more inclined to give this place a 3.5, but hey, their service was friendly so I'll classify it as a 4 :p  My boyfriend said he used to always come here with his dad when he was younger, so we decided to go for brunch the other weekend. Very traditional looking diner, felt a bit like I was transported back in time haha. Very similar to Fran's Restaurant in Toronto for those of you who have been there. The place is almost divided into two stores (apparently they bought out the store next to them at some point and expanded). In my opinion, I think some of the furniture is in need of being revamped, which can be done while still maintaining the classic diner look.  There are booths available for bigger groups, but we just got a regular two-seater. Started with coffee and tea (coffee is only $2 and you can get as many free refills as you'd like!).   We decided to split a french connection - 3 eggs, French toast, bacon, sausage, and home fries for $13. It was plenty of food foe us to share. He also ordered a chocolate milkshake (as he claims they're the best he's ever had), which I only tried a sip or two of, but from what I could tell, was awesome!   It was a pretty cool place,  if you're looking for a decent breakfast (or even lunch as they have a menu for that too) thats not overly expensive, I'd pay a visit here :)"}
{"text":"I have been anxiously waiting to review this Diner for the longest time. I now been here several times for brekkie and find the food very consistent and delicious. The home fries are deep fried and crunchy. Add some fried onions on top and BAM!  Pure breakfast bliss!  There is plenty of parking and plenty of seating inside. I hear the diner gets really busy during prime time during the week and on weekends. I usually show up around 930 to 10 and always get my regular booth.  The have the space for big groups too. The head chef Peter is a great guy.  If he isn't busy take the time to talk with him.   You have got to check this place out! Peace out Yelpers!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Amazing burgers and Greek salad.  We always order the large Greek salad and share. More than enough for 3-4 people, full of feta and black olives.  Then the smothered burger with cheese.  Amazing and filling. I often can't finish it all."}
{"text":"I decided to drop by alone for an early weekend breakfast. My waitress was slightly grouchy, but everyone has their off days so I didn't take much note of it. Besides, the other servers were quite friendly and frequently stopped by to check up on me.  Their food is quite alright. I had the bacon and eggs, served with home fries and toast. The bacon and eggs were cooked to perfection (with the eggs cooked to your liking). However, the home fries were slightly tough and seemed a little overcooked.  All in all, it was a good breakfast with fair portions. The 50s mom and pop style decorations adds a nice ambiance, though slightly dirty here and there. I'll probably stop by another time, for lunch this time."}
{"text":"Great little diner. Peter the owner/chef knows his stuff. The place is clean and relaxing. It can get busy but then all good diners get busy. I've never waited more than 10 minutes. Staff are friendly enough but I don't go there to make friends. I go there with my friends for some good diner food that is priced fairly. Great club house. Perfect eggs. Love their coffee. It's not Scaramouch but its damn good. Go there....you won't be disappointed. Tell Peter I sent you!!lol"}
{"text":"We loved it here at first but then me and my girlfriend experienced homophobic comments from the staff. We were asked not to TOUCH each other or to hide in the back at the tables near the washroom. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday around 1pm and it wasn't too busy so we got seats right away. I ordered the grand slam which has 3 eggs, 2 sausages, 2 pieces of bacon, 2 pancakes and home fries.  The good: The home fries were the highlight for me, they were fried, well portioned and yummy. The service was friendly and they always came to check on us and refilled our coffees regularly.   The bad: I was sitting in the long booth by the windows and I guess the cushions are really worn down because when I sat down I sunk in and it was an awkward angle for me to eat when the food came. The sausage was just a tad too fatty for me and the pancakes kinda came apart when I poured syrup on them. The coffee was also a little too watered down for my taste.  Overall, the portions were good and the service was good but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"Second time to Times Sqare Diner. Had a delicious meal,everyone was extra nice.I really enjoyed myself. Atmosphere was lively and friendly.The food was delish. So glad I found this Hot Spot."}
{"text":"I definitely should have ordered the breakfast !! I had the cheeseburger and poutine and my burger was great ! (Minus the marble cheese on it) but the poutine on the other hand was a little sad.. The gravy was cold and lumpy so I didn't eat it, but I also didn't have the heart to complain about it to the sweet lady who was our waitress .. My boyfriends club house sandwich on the other hand was amazing !!!!! The decor is so nostalgic, you can't beat the price and the staff are really kind"}
{"text":"Reviewing diners are hard, it is one of those situations where the food is pretty much universal. So when one needs to judge a diner, we need to look past the ordinary food and drink and look deeper.   Located just off Allen Rd at the intersection of Wilson heights and Sheppard. It is not exactly the center of Toronto, it is not even the center of North York. But that spot has been at that area for the past 60 years, that is saying something. The first thing you'll notice when you walk in is the bright colour of the booths and chairs. The walls are full of posters, pictures, memorabilia from an simpler times. If you go often, you can see that the same faces occupying the same seats at the bar, watching TV, bantering with each other, and having a good beer. It really sets the tone perfectly for a place where you can relax and drink in the atmosphere.   The waitress or waiter will greet you and when its not busy, sit where you like, pick a booth or table and start ordering. The menu is a pretty standard diner menu, dotted with classics like breakfast items, burgers, and tons of sandwiches. But since the owners are Greek, the souvlakis are great. If you are into fish and chips, this place is the place to go north of Toronto, huge halibut on top of crispy frenched fries and side of oil and vinaiger coleslaw. These item will satisfy your desire at anytime of the day (not 24hr though :( ). But doesn't matter what you order, the portions are huge and they are delicious. Many of their ingredients are homemade and you can taste it on the first bite. Dare I say one of the best burgers I had next to the burger priest.  The waiting staffs are friendly and fun. You can tell them about your day or just vent, you'll find them attentive and willing to listen. If you go there often, chat up one of the regulars, they have many interesting stories to share as they been around this area for ages.   As you can see, a diner is quite different from looking at other types of restaurant. Each one has their quarks and differences. But these features are what make them fun and interesting and amazing gems in any neighborhood."}
{"text":"Was in the area with the family and looking for a lunch spot. When in doubt- YELP! This dinner has been open since 1951 and is very nostalgic. It has booths with coat hangers, old juke boxes on the wall. As for the food- fantastic and reasonably priced. It's old but well kept. I do recommend a try."}
{"text":"Excellent place, amazing food. The service is just great and the place is pretty affordable.  I have been here several times and the food just keep getting better.  From the 20+ places I've been to for breakfast this is far te best."}
{"text":"I'm baffled by the good reviews. The waitress was good, friendly and good service. But the food... I had the halibut fish and chips. It was almost completely tasteless. All the malt vinegar and tarter sauce in the world couldn't save it. My husband had the corn beef hash with eggs and home fries. Also tasteless. My daughter ordered pancakes which were a little burned. My son had a burger from the kids menu and he enjoyed it. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Terrible service won't be going back. We stood at the front for 15 minutes before anyone even gave us the time of day. Will not recommend this spot. There are lots of other better places nearby for diner food."}
{"text":"The food is not consistent and the place really, really needs a thorough cleaning. The restaurant is filthy. Just look at the side of the floors/walls it is caked with black waste matter. The waitresses could be sleep walking at times.   But please, CLEAN THE PLACE WITH PROFESSIONAL CLEANING SERVICE at least once a month!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy...good old fashion diner with nice size portions and good coffee.  Good, quick service and relaxed atmosphere. Had the breakfast special and it was served hot and was very filling.  Nice diner...greasy spoon."}
