{"text":"Flip off, Mother India[1]. Peace out, Gandhi[2]. I got a new favorite roti dive in town and she's sizzling like a pepperpot. Vena's serves up outrageously delicious West-Indian-style roti, and I'm hooked. Here's why:

- The roti (flatbread) itself is tastier; the dough seems to have been worked over and over onto itself so that it's layered and springy; flavorful and tender to the bite but still delightfully resistant like a flirty little bread-tease.
- The fillings are lighter, flavored by coconut milk instead of the belly-bombing ingredients like cream and butter at the East-Indian counterparts
- I can customize the fillings at Vena's
- I can get goat
- I can add butternut squash
- The combination of spicy goat curry and sweet butternut squash is the kind of mind-blowing revelation that makes me kick myself for not having discovered it sooner. I am now covered in bruises.
- My roti was as big as a cinderblock and only cost $8
- Vena's does not charge tax
- I can get homemade hot sauce FREE OF CHARGE

You hear that, Gandhi? Vena's is tastier, cheaper, and throws in little freebies -- AND open on weekends -- so you can go suck it. I've jumped ship and landed off the Caribbean.

I love roti. I've tried it all over this city, from Islington/Lakeshore to Queen/Bathurst to Yonge/Steeles... and in many other cities too. Vena's makes the best roti in Toronto. I've never seen anyone eat inside, and you wouldn't want to either, unless you're hankering for a vintage game of competitive Pacman while you eat your lunch.
With a decent dining area, Vena's would be a 5. The prices are fantastic (chicken roti for $7, goat on rice special for $6) and the tastes are unbelievable. You will get a little cup with hot sauce when you order the roti: use with caution. But, make sure you use, because it's so good.

4 stars"}
{"text":"Very nice owner, and very good food. One day I didn't have enough money to pay for my roti, and he said don't worry about it. I though that was kind. A few days later I paid him the extra, and he was gracious and thankful. Number 1 place for delicious roti's!"}
{"text":"Extremely delicious rotis with a great selection of veggie fillings. Try your hand at a game of Ms. Pac Man while you wait for your made to order roti."}
{"text":"Ok - I know it's voted #1 by Now Magazine....must be when the wife is cooking!

Shame on me but when it's the husband - your order usually turns out wrong with whole potatoes instead of bite size...and the sauce is watery....

I know she needs a day off or two but can I get her schedule?????"}
{"text":"Vena's make a nice roti, but I did not find as earth shatteringly, toe curlingly wondrous as other reviewers on Yelp.    My primary argument against Vena's is their insistence on so blatantly scaling back on the more expensive ingredients in the fillings in order to preserve a low-ish price point.  

Still, if you are in the neighbourhood it is worth a stop. But I wouldn't stray far off course to get there considering there are so many better options in the GTA."}
{"text":"This is the one place I visit in Toronto the most often for take-out food.  Absolutely fabulous roti!   I usually order the chicken, green bean and potato.  Consistently fresh and absolutely delicious!  Love the hot-sauce.  The owner is a real nice guy also.  Try Vena's, you'll love it!  I'm definitely hooked.   : )"}
{"text":"It's perfectly edible, but I have no clue what the hype is. I had the goat and okra roti; none of the flavors were at all fresh and, although it was hot, everything tasted like it had been made a while ago. Given the reviews here, I really would have hoped for something less stale."}
{"text":"Exactly what I expected. Average, greasy West Indian Roti.

Oh sweet Gandhis / Mother India, I'm sorry, but I had to try Vena's just once! You need not worry, I'll never do it again. Promise."}
{"text":"My favourite in town has been feeding me and my family for over 20 years since they were a mainstay on Queen West.

Quality and portions have remained consistent.  This is an inexpensive meal so I don't expect fine cuisine, but it's freshly made, it's not slathered in sauce or overly salty, and the veggies included are healthy -- eat your spinach and squash kids! -- so I feel pretty good about taking out from there.

The hot sauce is spicy and vinegary, it's the perfect compliment.

Finally, the owner has a social conscience, giving away free meals to the poor at least once a year.

I will always be a customer here."}
{"text":"man, the portions are HUGE!
stopped here with a friend before our movie night. they have a good selection of veggie roties. but again one roti is HUGE! I had to share my mixed veggies roti with a friend and both of us were full. 
it's very hot inside the restaurant and you might want to enjoy your roti at home after you pick it up. if not - they have few tables where you can accommodate yourself.

next time I want to try mushroom curry rote. sounds delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I love the roti from this restaurant. I always get chicken, and sometimes if I'm feeling extra hungry I get double chicken. I have been eating roti here in toronto since I was a little girl and I have to say that Vena's is the best roti I've ever had. The shell is buttery and thick and amazing. The meat is perfect! No bones and cooked to perfection with so much flavour and never all the nasty parts of the chicken just light and dark meat. The gravy is just so flavourful and I love the ratio of potatoes to chicken. Its just sooo good. If you like spice, then have it  with the vinegary hot sauce they give you, the two go together just perfectly. This roti is never dry and always packed with flavour. I love this place. The people that own it are friendly and you can taste the love that goes into this food. I know that sounds corny but I mean it, you know you're getting some good, slow cooked chicken when you eat here. I love this roti so much. I also love that you can get things like squash or spinach or whatever you want in your roti. I don't get those things because I like mine plain and simple, but my boyfriend does when he goes and he loves it."}
{"text":"My favourite is the boneless goat with spinach and green beans. So yummy and delicious, I keep saying I am going to save half for later but that never happens!"}
{"text":"The roti is really really delicious. And the curries are great, too.  This is one of those spots where the food is so good, they didn't need to overcompensate with the ambience. Oh yeah, and because they didn't try hard with the ambience, the food is pretty affordable. No comment on bathroom, haven't tried to use it."}
{"text":"Some of the best roti takeout in the city.  I agree this shop is not doing itself any favours with the decor, but the product is delicious, cheap, and the portion sizes are huge.  I like that you can get hot sauce on the side.  The roti shell is fresh and so yummy, and you can mix and match from a giant list of fillings.  I love the veggie options.  I wish they were open a bit later.  I love Vena's!"}
{"text":"Best roti in town! I've been a customer for over a decade and although I no longer live in Toronto whenever I am back I get Vena's roti. Chickpea and eggplant with extra hot sauce on the side.... deeelish!"}
{"text":"Best roti in Toronto. I mix the veggies. I've tried all the top places in Toronto...this is the only One I look forward to having"}
{"text":"I wanted to love Vena's or, at the very least, like it... but after having their goat roti this afternoon, I've got to say I'm unimpressed.

The dough was very nice, that much is true -- excellent roti.  The filling, however, was lacking.  Large chunks of bland potato, little sauce, and only a few big hunks of meat.  Considering it's around the same price as Mother India/Gandhi Cuisine, I was surprised to find it contained maaaaaaaybe 1/4 the meat.  Taken together, it was a bland, dryish meal of largely dough and potato.  Meh.

It was accompanied by a little plastic cup of watery sauce that smelled of potent white vinegar and nothing else.  I pitched it -- the smell was very off putting.  Not sure what it was supposed to be.

Finally, about fifteen minutes post-roti, my stomach began to hurt.  Still hurts, and I'm very bloated.  T.M.I?  Maybe, but I'm sure inquiring Yelpers want to know when food doesn't sit well.

If it weren't for this last bit I'd have given it 2 stars, with the intention of going back another time (it was the gentleman working, and I hear his wife makes the superior roti)... due to the stomach ache, however, I'm heaping on but a single, lonely, bloated star, and likely will not return.

Sorry, Vena's :("}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong- delish, cheep and fast...been one of my favorites for years. Sadly tonight I was 1/2 way done and found a meal worm/maggot type thing in it!!! Never again! I could get past the stores terrible ghetto appearance before, but it's ruined! RUINED!"}
{"text":"I really like their fast/good service and deal of $5 chicken curry including drink but I must say the flavor is off in the curry and rice. It didn't really taste fresh and the beans had a bad taste. I must add that they were out of goat curry at 12:30 PM. However it's worth coming to try the roti since it's cheap."}
{"text":"Yes, this place is yummy.  I looove the squash/potato/chickpea combination.  But those who claim this is the best roti in Toronto have certainly not tried Island Foods... mmm..now that's a roti.  The roti bread here can be a bit on the dry side. At Island Foods, the juice drips all the way down to your elbows.

$8 for a roti. Not the cheapest but when you see how big they are it justifies the price."}
{"text":"Best roti in TO. Fast and reliable service. Very reasonable. They only take cash though!"}
{"text":"Great Roti. Great Value. Unpretentious. I love the mix veg roti."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that hasn't dropped off my food radar since I first tried it many years ago. I love the vegetarian combo, but they're all very good, depending on your preference for meat. Sadly, I have to drop a star for the unloved dining area; there's nothing charming about dirty walls, and environmentally unfriendly practices (styrofoam and plastic cutlery for eating in, no recycle for cans). Make that 2 stars dropped. C'mon Vena's... I want you to do better!"}
{"text":"Roti: 10/10. Hot sauce: 5/10. Decor and setting: 1/10. F&$Ks given about anything other than Roti? 0/10."}
{"text":"I used to live in the area about 20 yrs ago but never tried Venas. I have been to Island Foods, Bacchus, Ram's Roti shop and a few others all over Toronto. This is by far the worst roti I have ever had. I went during lunch time on a Friday afternoon. It was not worth the money at all. I had a chicken roti. I don't know why the sign outside says it is the best roti. I would go to another place. 

I am shaking my head at the excellent reviews of this place."}
{"text":"Is it a hole-in-the-wall? Yep. Is it a bit greasy? Sure. Does the table top video game machine work? Not any more I don't think. But if you're in the neighbourhood or consider yourself a real roti reveller (I do) than this has to be on your list to try.  

Somehow the chicken is always cooked perfectly and the curry gravy is unlike anywhere else in Toronto, in a good way, you won't leave hungry.  Squash, spinach, and chick peas (and sometimes eggplant) also make for a wonderful veg choice. Oh, the goat is great too. Ginger beer obviously. 

The sign in the window does not lie--what this one man can do with a roti wrap (or rice dish) is nothing short of remarkable. Landsdowne gem."}
{"text":"Stopped here today on my way back from a rollerblading trip to High Park.

I hate to say it, but, I would have NEVER stopped here had I not read the other Yelp reviews. The place is pure ghetto inside. Combined with the sketchy neighbourhood means it's not exactly the most inviting venue. 

There are two 2-seater tables inside, one of which is actually an 80s arcade game. So take out it is.

I tried a veggie roti with butternut squash, chickpeas and eggplant. It was HUGE, pretty tasty and only $7 all in. The roti bread was quite good. I didn't like that the butternut squash was essentially two GIANT pieces of squash rather than cut up into smaller squares, but other than that, great roti.

Mine didn't even take 10 mins, I probably only waited 3-4 mins.

Overall, very good, but I'm not quite convinced that it's the best roti in Toronto!

PS - Cash only"}
{"text":"This shit is fucked. Don't go here if you're prone to getting emotional about adorable decorations. Great food, could not be more casual. What's the difference between us? We can start at the Vena's.

They also have Jumex. Strong contract."}
{"text":"Fantastic Roti, I usually order the goat with potato and okra and have never been disappointed.
Suggest you plan for takeout as the interior isn't easy on the eyes. Also remember its cash only, but with every item at $9 or under this shouldn't be a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Arguably the best roti in Toronto, Vena's may be short on ambiance and dining space, but the ingredients are as fresh as you could hope for and the staff offers consistently prompt, friendly service.  I've sampled roti all over Toronto at this point and the litany of offenses is longer than my arm.  Either they use chopped, frozen spinach, pureed squash or otherwise unsatisfactory ingredients.  This little corner of the ghetto near Lansdown Sta always delivers the best, most delicious roti ever.  If you like it really spicy like I do, you might have a bit of a time convincing the cook, but if you can, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Vena's is located in the WORST neighbourhood but it's worth the trek to get out at Lansdowne station to check it out. I usually order a spicy squash and potato roti, sometimes adding cauliflower into the mix. This isn't your typical 'saucy' roti - it does have an amazing texture and the portion is MASSIVE (there's no way you can finish it in one sitting). 

It's about a 10 minute wait for the roti as they make it from scratch, and even the most expensive item on the menu is under $10."}
