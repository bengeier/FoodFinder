{"text":"Ce café vient tout juste d'ouvrir, situé juste à côté du métro, c'est l'endroit idéal pour prendre son café à emporter le matin!  Le café est très petit, il n'y a donc pas de place pour s'y assoir à l'intérieur et y rester pour travailler ou lire un livre.   Il y'a une terrasse chauffée et le wifi est gratuit.  Et bien sûre le café est très bon et il y a possibilité de l'accompagner avec un délicieux cake à la banane!"}
{"text":"Located right next to metro laurier, this little coffee shop serves coffee floater!!! It's pretty good, but the cold brew was a bit too sour."}
{"text":"Working at a coffee shop that has a barista and cupping program, I can now taste the difference between good and bad coffee (still not great at it). This place has delicious coffee! I'm the type to drink a cold brew with a splash of oat milk, which is what I ordered. Very pleased! The place is very tiny but very cute to chill if you can find a seat. They also have this cool cold brew float but they only start offering that at 11am. I'm sad I missed the opportunity but hopefully the next time I'm in Montreal, I'll make a stop by here. Also, the fact that they have oat milk is already a sign of a good coffee place !!! OAT MILK IS LIFEEEE"}
{"text":"This is amazing spot for a coffee. It is also exceptionally convenient because it is right next to Laurier metro station.   I was exploring the city a bit with my camera, and I stumbled upon Noble Café on a whim. You'll notice that its quite small, and they have no indoor seating, although they have chairs outside.   I ordered a latté, and it was one of the best I've had in my life. The barista was friendly and worked really quickly. I like these little \"hole in the wall\" cafés, and this happens to be one of the best in town.   If you're in Montréal and you love coffee, this is as must-try. I highly recommend Noble, and will be coming back to try their pistachio ice cream!"}
{"text":"Excellent brewed coffee. Very friendly guy at the counter. Super nice design of a small space. I love the window service. A great place to sit outside."}
{"text":"Saturday morning opening event, long line that almost extended outside. Really cool and enthusiastic staff. I took a latté, a bag of beans Kittel beans and each one of their three pastries. The raisin almond danoise - absolutely delicious. The latté was on the mellow side and lacked a bit of character - I forgot to ask what beans they used. But I'll give it a second try when they're less busy.  The place is kind of very cool though. A minimalistic and cozy design with a heated exterior terrace and ice-cream style window. Add the friendly local atmosphere and it fits right in the neighborhood. I normally don't give charm points but +1 for this one.  Great authentic experience overall. It's always nice to see places like this open."}
{"text":"My friend has been wanting to try Noble Café forever! It's super cold and rainy out there. Happily, the cafe is just across of Mont Royal metro.   It's a tiny and the cutest café in Montreal. It wasn't busy... since it's a such a gloomy day. We got nice spot to stand by the window. We both ordered a chai latte, then stood by the window.   Service was really good. The ladies who were serving us, were really nice.   Our chai was really good. The sugar amount in it was perfect!   I want to come again, especially next summer to try their coffee with ice cream."}
{"text":"Loved it. It's cute and tiny, tasty food and staff was friendly. Prices weren't bad either."}
{"text":"Chaque fois, mon chai latté glacé est dé-li-cieux! Les employés sont gentils par contre ce n'est pas un café où on peut s'asseoir à l'intérieur.   Lorsque le beau temps se pointe le bout du nez, il est possible de prendre une place dehors au petit comptoir ou aux tables mais elles sont peu nombreuses. Sinon il y a la station Laurier juste en face avec quelques bancs.   C'est plutôt agréable comme endroit surtout par un bel après-midi ensoleillé ou sur son heure de dîner!"}
{"text":"The best coffee in Montreal. I could have sat here for hours. It's small but thrilling to get a cup here. I wish I lived in Montreal because I would spend my weekends here. Very delicately brewed. They are coffee connoisseurs here. I recommend it with my whole heart."}
{"text":"I often passed by this small cafe when I was taking my walks around le plateau. It was always packed with people sitting outside enjoying their drinks. It wasn't until a cold rainy fall day that I decided to check this place out, and boy I was not disappointed. The cafe is more of a coffee pitstop but my friend and I stood by the window and enjoyed our chai lattes. I could almost imagine how great it would be to sit outside with a cold coffee in the summer. Now I must wait till summer 2018 to experience this. The chai lattes were great and the atmosphere was nice. The service was also very good and quick. If you're around laurier and need some coffee or tea in your system, do check this place out."}
{"text":"One of my go-to cafes, particularly when Maxime is working. Pulls consistent shots and is always happy to share his knowledge. De Mello, Phil and Seb, Kittel and guest roasters."}
{"text":"How could I give anything less than a 5 star review for a place that sorts me out almost every morning with a fantastic coffee (and pastry sometimes, but not often, but probably too often) before work? Thank you, Noble. Friendly, lovely staff.   This place is small, so it's coffee to go. Unless it's summer when there are a few little tables set up outside."}
{"text":"Le Noble, c'est minuscule.  Deux places assistes à l'intérieur, pas le temps de traîner avec ton ordinateur. Service 5/5, goût impeccable.  Décor chic et épuré, mais t'auras même pas le temps de le remarquer tellement tu vas passer vite. L'accent du serveur m'a rappelé la maison (lire ici: les Maritimes) et j'ai failli lui demander s'il voulait que je lui apporte des p'tits muffins à l'amour.  Vas-y. Tu vas tripper."}
{"text":"N'étant pas une buveuse de café, j'écris ce commentaire au nom de tous mes amis. Je n'ai jamais de café chez moi, ce qui fait en sorte que lorsqu'un ami a besoin de sa dose de caféine, je les guide vers Noble: cet adorable petit café du coin (littéralement situé sur un coin devant la station Laurier). Non seulement aucun de mes amis ont été déçus, mais la plupart en font l'éloge. Voyez-vous, parait-il que le café est excellent chez Noble.   J'en doute pas. J'aime bien me gâter avec des chocolats chauds, et en été ils ont de la crème glacée trop bonne. Et même des sandwichs à la crème glacée hallucinants. Pour vrai, imaginez de la crème glacée à la vanille entre deux tranches de pâte à biscuits. C'est fou. Juste fou. Parlant de fou, ils ont aussi un float à l'espresso qui a l'air délicieux. Mais bon, j'bois pas de café donc qu'est-ce que j'en sais!"}
{"text":"J'aime beaucoup ce petit café et pas uniquement parce que la serveuse que j'ai vue est magnifique   Non plus sérieusement le lieu est petit (c'est même limité a 6 personnes) mais l'ambiance est vraiment bonne. Il y a de la musique (même dehors pour ceux qui attendent) , un bon staff et surtout un très bon café.   On oubli assez rapidement la taille du lieu en fait et je pense qu'en été avec le parc Laurier à proximité ca sera parfait."}
{"text":"This spot is the BOMB. A must when you visit Montreal!  I got a medium, with 4 small scoops (2 pistachio, 2 dark chocolate)- I highly highly highly recommend the pistachio. Noble Cafe has the best pistachio ice cream I've EVER had. The dark chocolate wasn't as amazing as the pistachio so I wish I tried something else. My friends got the soft serve and the brownie ice cream sandwich and they also said it was amazing.   I love the layout of Noble Cafe and how even though the shop itself is tiny, there are chairs and benches right outside for you to enjoy your ice cream. This place is super cute and Instagram worthy   Definitely going to visit Noble Cafe every time I visit Montreal. Next time, I also want to try some of their drinks and definitely the cookie dough ice cream sandwich (which was sold out when I went). Can't wait to bring my friends here!"}
{"text":"Small quaint coffee shop just off Saint Denis. Places to sit outside and enjoy summer in Montreal or grab a coffee to go in your way to parc Laurier. They even serve some soft serve ice cream. Give it a try makes for a great summer day. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The cutest little cafe by Laurier metro, it's incredible that they were able to squeeze so much goodness into such a tiny place.   Grab a coffee or some soft serve ice cream, kick back on the benches outside, and watch Laurier life happen before your eyes. There's really no better way to spend a sunny day."}
{"text":"Joli petit endroit pour prendre un bon (et joli) café à emporter ou à boire dehors en terrasse (chauffée quand il fait froid) car il y a peu d'espace à l'intérieur."}
{"text":"Leur café est très bon. Le service est sympa, dépendamment de la personne à la caisse. On m'a cependant surchargé à quelques reprises car le personnel ne semblait pas au courant des options possibles de la caisse.  Pour ce qui est de la crème glacée, je suis fan des saveurs offertes ! Par contre, des bols de différentes grosseurs serait une bonne option lorsque nous prenons plus qu'une ou deux boules."}
{"text":"This a nice place to stop on your way to or from the Laurier metro. The Coffee is quite good the pastry are very good but its is more of a coffee pit stop that's why I gave it 3/5 and not more."}
{"text":"GREAT spot. Small little hole in the wall. Perfect to grab on your morning commute because it's close to the metro. Also love coming here on the weekend, sitting on a bench, and stopping by the Laurier farmers market on Sunday mornings in the summer/fall.   Note, no real inside seating area, but they have chairs outside and put out heating lamps in the winter.  Staff is super friendly!! Always has a fun playlist going!   In the summer they also offer ice cream (soft serve + hard packed). Get the affogato (ice cream with espresso poured over) for a special treat!   Personally not the hugest fan of their pastry caterer, would recommend going down the street to \" fou desserts \".   Brews Zab coffee. Always fun to try something that's not 49th parallel in Montreal (not that 49th isn't amazing to be fair...)   For non coffee drinkers: Love their chai latte mix from The Chai Company as well! Also has Kusmi tea :)"}
