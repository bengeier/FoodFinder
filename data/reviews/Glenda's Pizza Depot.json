{"text":"Ordered pizza here and it was amazing. Probably one of the best delivery pizza we've ever had. I had a white sauce pizza and it was very good. The delivery was pretty quick and everything turned out fine. I highy recommend this to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Delivery time was awesome, here in less that the eta.  Pizza, good as always.  Mushroom Swiss burger, great.  Great Zukes? No idea what they used to coat them, but the Zukes are too thin and it's all bad tasting batter .... avoid it.  

Do these people even try some of the other items on their menu, or is this stuff just there to satisfy those who are tired of pizza or wings and create an illusion of variety?  Delivery options out here are limited, it would be nice if what is available was better quality."}
{"text":"Pizza from here is the favorite of my nieces and nephews hence any stars at all.  I have found the pizza to be too doughy, cheese too sparse, and that the sauce tastes like Heinz 57.  If you have the palate of a six year old, then this is the pizza for you.  Otherwise, there are many better choices in the area."}
{"text":"Over the years this place has gone from my favorite pizza to a \"well I do want Glendas but I want good Glendas\"...

It used to be a perfect pie every time...now it's a long wait on the phone by generally confused help (mixing up phone numbers, can't understand names) that really do not seem excited that you are coming into their business to keep it going. 

We ordered Friday and it was a basic no frills - pepperoni and banana pepper - pick up.  30 mins - ok cool.  We get it in the car - smells great right - I mean whole SUV is like tomato - basil heaven...we get it home and it's cold, cheesy in some places, barren in others, with the taste of burnt sauce and all crust...

I just don't know...I mean Glendas is super affordable and I want to like it every time - because I love them...well loved them...this one like the last few was just eh."}
{"text":"Maybe they can hear my eyes rolling as I write this review. I've only lived here for 4 years and in that time frame, they have gone from our favorite pizza place to Um, no.  

I should probably put the disclaimer out there that this is about their food delivery. We gave them a lot of business, up until recently. It went something like this: Pizza was delivered, it was wrong, missing toppings. The roast beef sandwich was sans Au Jus for dipping. And we even got something we didn't order.

We call them back. The new, correct items were delivered and the driver demanded that we give our whole order back to him! Who does that? Like we were being accused of lying about it or something. Or maybe it was because they had to come back to our house every single damn time that we ordered (no exaggeration there!) as a result of them screwing it up. 

So, who knows? What I do know for sure though is that I will never give them my business again."}
{"text":"Placed an online order for pick up 2 hours in advance. Showed up and the lady who was working up front had no idea I was coming in. I made my order and payed at 2pm for 4pm and am still waiting in the lobby for my order. Horrible customer service, didn't even apologize for the inconvenience of waiting in the lobby when it should have been done!"}
