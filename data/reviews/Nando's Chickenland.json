{"text":"The best flamed chicken ever ... I wish Nando's had locations in Downtown or West Toronto"}
{"text":"The Nando's at this location is now closed, replaced by another chicken place called Roosters. The menu selection and flavours are almost identical to the old Nando's and the quality is still quite good though I miss the friendly owners from the old place."}
{"text":"We ordered a 25 order for takeout and everything was mixed up. Poor service and the person was rude. Food was decent though but the customer service is horrible."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken quarter with peri fries and pita with red dip. Chicken was very flavorful but still fairly greasy. Peri fries were way too salty. And the pita and dip were sub par. Just one dry 4-5 inch pita and a sweet tasting dip. In my opinion it was too expensive for the quality.  Also the takeout was just in a bag , not in boxes. Biscuits with chicken would have been nice. I would go back for the chicken only."}
