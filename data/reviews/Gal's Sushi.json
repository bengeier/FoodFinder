{"text":"Been to Gal's at least 10+ times.

The lunch deal is where it's at. The L4 Sashimi combo is tasty and filling. At $7.99 with miso soup and salad, it's a deal. I'm a pretty big eater and I am very full after it. 

Couple other noteworthy items:
- Spicy Salmon roll (fresh and well seasoned)
- Soon Tofu (Nice and spicy with deep flavours and silky tofu)
- BiBimBap (Generous and fresh toppings)"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Japanese/Korean place in the area (not that there are many other Japanese restaurants around this stretch). My family and I go here regularly for dinner and always grab the bento specials. They are fast, delicious and well sized portions! I would highly recommend the bulgogi beef when you order your bento. I can personally never finish my portion, but that means I can always get leftovers for the next day!"}

{"text":"Korean style hwe. SOOOO delicious. We had to wait about 20 minutes on a Sunday night at 8pm. We got the small Korean flounder hwe combo. It came with an appetizer of tempura (huge portion), a dish of Korean style sashimi with all the ssahm sides (so delicious and fresh), and then a fish soup at the end. We asked for less spicy since we have a toddler, but it was honestly very bland. Wish it had a little bit more flavor. We also got an eel and avocado roll which was big and full of avocados. Service was good for being very busy. Will return!"}
{"text":"This is honestly the worst sushi place ever! I found hair in my sushi and I was so disgusted! Also, the service was so bad and really slow. It took forever for my food to come, it took so long I got so dizzy I lost my appetite. I don't recommend anyone to go to this restaraunt it's the worst!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to this restaurant about half a year and I came again tonight. The food quality drops a lot especially the sushi. They put too much salt and MSG and you cannot really taste the food. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Shrimp tempura 5/5
Beef terriyaki 2/5
Shrimp tempura dragon 2/5
Gam ja tang 3/5 
Chap chae 4/5
Chicken katsu 4/5
California roll 4/5

7 of us came for a family birthday dinner, with ages ranging from 12 to 90 we would need a diverse menu to satisfy everyone.

We didn't order sushi or sashimi based on the other reviews. But we ordered several different dishes. 

The night was busy (surprising) so the food took a while. 

The shrimp tempura was crisp, clean, with a light sweet sauce. 

An unacceptable number of shrimp shell bits in the shrimp tempura dragon  4 shell bits in one piece and even one bit in the tempura

Chicken katsu surprisingly not dry.  

Beef teriyaki was bland.

Overall value for money: 2/5 
Service: 2/5
Satisfaction after meal: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today with my daughter and sister. We ordered Shrimp Tempura appetizer, A2. Assorted Sushi, and an Avocado Roll. The server was quick to drop off tea, soup, free noodle app, and free sweet potato app. Shortly afterwards, she brought over the dip for the Shrimp Tempura appetizer. About 15-20 minutes later, she brought the Assorted Sushi and the Avocado Roll, but no Shrimp Tempura. After finishing the rolls and sitting around for a chat, we looked at the time and realized we have to go for our appointment, but still no Shrimp Tempura. I asked the server for the bill and she was quick to point out that our Shrimp Tempura has not arrived. I told her we had to go because we have an appointment. She insisted that I take it with me but since it's deep-fried, it would be soft and soggy once it cools. I asked her to cancel it for that reason. She said she'll go and check. Within seconds, she came back with the Shrimp Tempura appetizer!!! upon dropping it off, she said, \"They made it already.\" I went on telling her that I have to go because I have an appointment. She insisted I take it with me and I had to explain to her again why I don't want it. She repeated, \"They made it already.\" She should've told me that it would take over half an hour to deep-fry less than 10 pieces of veggies and shrimp. If I knew that the Shrimp Tempura appetizer was suppose to come at the end of my meal, like a dessert, I wouldn't have ordered it. In terms of food, it tasted good. However, I'm the type of person who cares more about the service and the experience. There are plenty of sushi restaurants along Hwy 7 and I'm sure they're comparable for food. However, not everyone can provide good service and good experience. Depending on location, I feel that I get better service from McDonald's than Gal's Sushi and there's no need to tip at McDonald's. For that reason, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been to Gal's a couple of times, and I have never been disappointed. Each time they have served  consistently fresh fish, great service, and attention to presentation. Definitely a go-to place whenever the sushi cravings arise!


I'm all about  the appetizers, so was delighted when they served my two favourite ones after we ordered: glass noodle and potato. The glass noodles isn't too oily, and the potato is cooked soft with a sweet glaze. The fact that it was unlimited was a bonus!

\"Gal Combi\" ($37.99) -20 peice sashimi,12 peice sushi (uni, hamachi, tuna unagi, salmon, scallopi) and 6 peice dynamite maki :
20 pieces may not sound like a lot, but this was enough to fill two people sufficiently. If you like raw fish, you can't go wrong ordering sashimi at Gal's. The fish is SOOO fresh, and nicely sized. Whenever I come here I always end up ordering some sort of sushi set because they usually offer a nice mixture of rolls, sashimi and sushi, with a wide variety of fish. The rice ratio and composition of the sushi is also just the way I like it, with minimal rice, and more fish!

At the end of the meal they serve you some complimentary peices of fruit, and this red bean jelly dessert. I was stuffed at this point, so it was nice to end off on some lighter post-meal desserts. Another satisfying meal at Gal's!"}
{"text":"I want to give 4 stars, because the food is really fancy and you really can't get fresher flounder, but OH MAN the service is bad.

It's not unfriendly, but we had to ask for refills of water at least 4 times, and each time, we'd get a \"oh, sorry, yes, I'll be right back!\" and then nothing. Eventually two different servers brought us an entire pot of tea.

They kept bringing more and more food (that we couldn't eat because we were parched), our table was overflowing. We piled up the empty dirty dishes for them to take away, but they wouldn't they the dishes away until we explicitly handed the dirty dishes to them, \"would you please take these away?\"

We were a table of 6, ordering quite a bit of expensive food, so I don't know why the service was so bad."}
{"text":"Do not go to this restaurant. On a busy night you can see four cooks preparing food and possibly 2 managers watching doing nothing, even when there are customers who need to be seated or served. 

They had only three servers who ran around looking like they were doing something but achieving nothing.

Huge line at door and not one single employee even looked at the lineup. Half the people just left.

Stay away from this place. You won't even get seated."}
{"text":"Sushi was on par with Scarborough Town Center's End of the Day Sale sushi, which means it was trash. You can get better sushi at many other places for much cheaper (Niji, Akane, Yoko, and many more). Live octopus was cool but expensive ($28) but I rather smoke two packs of belmonts and shorten my life than eat it again. Two stars because the service was good and that saved them."}
{"text":"This has become our go-to sushi place. The sushi is always fresh and delicious. We get the $30 sushi platter, which is perfect for two people. The service is always fast, and the servers are pleasant. They give you salads and potatoes while you wait for your food, which is a nice touch. After your meal, they bring you little bottles of korean yoghurt which is also delicious."}
{"text":"I came back to Gal's recently and unfortunately as much as it pains me to say this but the quality isn't what it used to be from my last review... The sashimi wasn't as fresh. The rolls are still decent and they still serve plenty of sides thankfully. But I'm rating this restaurant differently and more accurately with my current experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant has definitely change owners and lowered their standard! 

On August 23, 2014, we decided to go out to our old \"favourite\" Gal Sushi for a quick dinner and of course, ordered our old \"favourite\" food. 

We ordered Galbi (LA) style - $24.99 beef rib with big bones  and d a bento with sushi and sashmi. 

The moment we walked in , we knew something changed. 
The old Korean greeting was not heard...usually the sushi chefs all shouted out..it was sort  of their tradition. 

Nothing was heard and it was like going to a new place. 

All our regular  Korean servers were not there. We thought it was a day off but for all of them...

We ordered our food from a new server . We had to remind them that we wanted tea. He was quick to get it..

Usually when we ordered galbi, it would take about 20 minutes because they do have to cook it over a grill..and came in like you just BBQ from the backyard. 

For this meal, the galbi came out 2 minutes after we consumed our regular soup and salad. Then we realized why: it was a precooked and re-steamed galbi. For the last 8 years when I ordered this, the galbi came medium or sometimes medium rare.  This galbi was very well done, tasted steamed and even the bone part was well done. It was simply not possible to BBQ on a grill and served the food in 5 minutes (total time from order to serve). 

We were very surprised and ate some because we were famished. 
But even a hungry stomach cannot eat steamed meat with grilled marks (barely there) ... It was horrid. It tasted like dry steam meat tenderized by baking soda with MSG (famous cheap Taste enhancer)  and grilled marks. They had the nerve to make this their signature dish! 

And NO one came back to see if our meal was okay. Now I knew why! 

We had the sushi and sashimi bento with shrimp tempura. 
The shrimp tempura was re-fryed because it shrank after retrying and tasted very dry.  It was served with a tiny tiny soya sauce plate which you can barely dip the tempura in. It showed that they don't know what they are doing. Tempura sauce is usually served in as all bowl or sauce plat big enough yo dip your fried food in...this one measured one inch square. 

The sashimi was okay because they did not reheat it. 
The sushi was passable . But we were glad we did not order our large combo because hat would test their skill a bit more. 

Service was definitely lower because no one came by until we asked for our bill. It is definitely new ownership and new crew. My disclaimer is that non Japanese  or Koreans can manage a good sushi restaurant (e.g. Dragon legend). I heard the chefs were talking in Chinese and so were the servers. They brought in their usual habit like the one we no longer visit : Wasabi  on 
West Beaver Creek - cheap food and average service. 

It is sad that another good place is replaced...

Now need to find another or drive to North York spring garden street..."}

{"text":"Reasonably priced sushi platters that are great for sharing.

I've been here a handful of times for dinner. Fortunately, it's a large place so even on a busy week night I've never had to wait that long (~10 mins max). There's a large selection of food, most of the time I order a sushi, sashimi, and rolls combo to share with others. The larger the combo, the better, as the selection of sushi and sashimi increases. In addition to the typical salmon, tuna, and cooked shrimp, the larger combos also come with unagi, sweet shrimp, white tuna, scallop... 

Service is normally pretty quick as they have the 'call' button whenever you need something. As a regular sushi eater, I can definitely tell between bad and good sushi and they serve pretty good sushi! I always leave feeling really full and satisfied. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to gals for years now and I enjoy the food so much that I rave to friends and family about this place all the time! I have been to many sushi places around the GTA and I have to say gals had the absolute best quality sushi of them all. 

My favourite roll is the crab salad roll which I can't get enough of! The service for both dine in and take out is fabulous and very fast. If you dine in, you get house salad and miso soup with your meal (for both lunch and dinner). The lunch specials are great value for money and we very filling as well, the L3 is my favourite bento box and is the best value if your looking for a good variety of rolls. If your looking for amazing sushi, great service and good value for money this is your place!"}
{"text":"Been here for their lunch special and was surprised as to how much I was getting for the price. The lunch menu price ranged from 9.99-12.99 depending on which lunch bento box you get, along with a miso soup and salad. The quality is pretty good for the price. The one thing is that there is a slight wait time for service so 4.5/5."}
{"text":"Serious food poisoning after having sashimi here. Please beware and dine at your own risk. Will never return."}
{"text":"fantastic cheap lunches, this is probably my most frequently visited sushi place. 
mind you the quality is decent but this isn't a high end sushi joint or anything but to me it's better than a lot of sushi offerings in markham.
you get what you pay for and thats good enough for me! prompt quick service, never had an issue with them."}
{"text":"Gal's is just mediocre. Ive had cheaper in Downtown that tasted way better. The problem is for its pricing, its not exactly high end, its more of the lower end of restaurants however with that being said, Most of the cheap eat-ins are alot better in midtown/downtown or hwy 7. Its not really worth the trip however if your in the area and you enjoy bland japanese or korean food. go for it."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Sat night.  Array of 7 chefs behind the sushi counter was impressive.

Negi Hamachi roll was amazing - perfect proportions of fresh fish and green onion, neither overpowered the other.  SU2 - 26pc sushi platter was very well done.  Food arrived quickly.  Fish was fresh, rice was well packed.  

Tables had the doorbell service, but we never needed to use it.  We'll definitely be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"The food was perfect and cheif was nice 
We had sashimi and also korean soju.
But the server was rude. Came on may 12th especialy the one server's attitude was horrible.(black hair) If she is not here i would come every week. All 3 stars for the cheifs for serving perfect food.
If you guys are thinking about this restaurant to visit. Dont mind about server. The food is perfect. I go this place next time and give them 5 stars. But not this time."}
{"text":"Presentation and service is excellent but the sushi is average.
Don't sit near the aquarium tanks or you'll be eating sushi while some guy fights to net some live fish into a bucket as the fish flails water around.
Other than that a good overall experience."}
{"text":"At the recommendation of a friend (who also joined us for dinner), a group of us went to Gal's Sushi to satisfy our craving for some Japanese food. I was told that I HAD to order their black sesame ice cream for dessert. Having never tried this, I was a little hesitant at first because I never had black-coloured ice cream before. But I knew I liked black sesame paste (traditional Chinese dessert), so I decided to go for it. Boy, was it good!!! Afterwards, I tried to re-create the experience by eating a store-bought (PC brand?) version and it was nowhere nearly as good. You have to go to Gal's Sushi! Just a bit of advice though. I recommend that you share this experience with close friends/family if you don't want to be embarrassed by your black-sesame-stained smile :)"}
{"text":"I came to Gal's Sushi for dinner this past weekend and we ordered the best choice combo #. It had a really good selection of sushi and sashimi (uni, hamachi, scallop, sweet shrimp, tuna, salmon etc). They also give pretty tasty glass noodles and potatos for appetizers. I would've given 4 stars except I think they raised the price of the combo. I'm pretty sure it used to be $36 but now it's $40, that extra $4 cost them a star in my book."}
{"text":"One of favourite sushi places in town for both lunch and dinner! There is a great selection of lunch specials for both bento boxes and korean dishes. The bento boxes come with soup and salad and my favourite boxes to get are the sushi box and the sashimi box for $8.99. I think this is one of the cheapest bento lunch specials around- the sashimi is very fresh and well portioned. 

The dinner options are equally as delicious, I would recommend getting a Chan combo (60 pcs, sashimi, sushi and rolls - $62.99) if you are dining with a couple other people. 

The service is very quick and the place is busy all the time. If you order take out, remember to bring enough cash to get 10% off! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a good a la carte Japanese restaurant that is decently priced."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi joint in the city hands down.  This place never disappoints and the service is impeccable."}
{"text":"I have started regularly coming here for a lunch box. 

The sushi is very good quality. and the value is great too - for 9 bucks I got some sashimi (8 pieces I think?) some nigiri (4 pieces?), 6 pieces of roll, some noodles, some rice, some miso soup and a bit of salad. (and tea of course). service is super fast (they have little buttons at each table to press if you want to order or get a server to come by). lots of seating so no matter when I come in I have been seated immediately."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where they serve both Korean and Japanese food. I've been here a few times, and I'll probably come back again mostly because it's close to other places I have to be ;P

The food and service is generally ok, but I subtract one star for lack of consistency. I would put the sushi/sashimi I've had here between the \"Meh\" and \"Quite Good\" depending on the visit. Ditto on the service. I only had Korean once - it was the spicy Korean fish soup, which was very spicy and had way too many bones.

Generally the lunch deals are pretty good value. Some of the other menu items seem kind of overpriced, though."}
{"text":"Notes: wanted for sushi, never really tried the infamous Korean Fluke sashimi which lots of guests are ordering there.. by the way, it's not written in the English menu though..

Went there for sushi, the fish are fresh., Average taste. better than AYCE ones but definitely not as good as premium Japanese owned ones mid/downtown..

I will say the typical neat Korean run Sushi bar.. tried their Chicken skewer, it's below average.. not the tender at all

They do not have enough server and going on a weekend is not a good idea..service-wise not that non-Korean friendly in some way.."}
{"text":"Got some takeout on Friday night and to put into nice words it was an absolute disaster. The R3 tray came with no wasabi what so ever and the soya souse packed in small container was actually the one used for cooking. Sushi rolls were really small and literally tasteless. I've been here few times in the past but in my opinion the quality and service in running full steam downwards!"}
{"text":"Gets a stars for value of the sashimi bento box lunch, otherwise food and services are below average. All the waitresses just seem to not care and have a terrible attitude. No one gave us a menu for the longest time until we asked. The food do not look like the pictures, and when asked about it, they just shrugged it off. It is Hard to find parking as well. A lot of the plates are cracked and needs to be replaced - it harbours a lot of bacteria. 

Find a better sushi restaurant around the area if not for the convenience."}
{"text":"Love the food here! This restaurant serves both Japanese and Korean cuisine, so you get the best of both worlds. (ba dum tsss)

Do yourself a favor and order a bibimbap (Korean rice bowl) so you can get the little side dishes (which will help fill you up more). The side dishes were not spicy; instead they were sour or sweet. Think potatoes in sweet sauce or pickled veggies. The sushi rolls here are on the smaller side, but were delicious nonetheless. For the price, the food will satisfy you pretty well. The lunch specials look really good (especially for the price) but I did not try them.

For some reason there were a lack of waiters walking around, which made it harder to get the check...but the food does make up for it.

Only giving it 4 star because they didn't give side dishes last time :'( && of the creepy pictures in the bathroom stalls on top of the toilet !"}
{"text":"Came here after a good hard workout and was ready to feast! Recommended by two friends, both said this place was really good. They'll be sending me hate mail when they see my review. 

I ordered a bento box along with a sashimi platter to share. I think I've been spoiled by Ninki's (on Adelaide St.) bento boxes, good tasting and cheap! The bento boxes at Gal's were ok, you get an abundance of food, 11 pcs of sushi, 4 or 5 slices of sashimi, teriyaki salmon and rice for $15.99. Like the previous reviewer said, their sushi and sashimi needs to improve, their sashimi slices were way too small. Very disappointed, I've had better. 

One thing that was good was my friend's L.A Kal Bi (Korean style short ribs), the meat was thick, tender and flavourful. For dessert we ordered black sesame ice cream, I was impressed with that, very good! I don't think they make it in-house so can only give credit for a good job finding and sourcing it. 

The name of the restaurant has \"sushi\" in it, you'd expect the place to offer good sushi/sashimi, Gal's Sushi simply did not deliver."}
{"text":"We order the (they mentioned this is special combo set)SIL combo $79.99 take out, the menu says we will get some Uni, Amebi, hamachi, scallop or some specialty fish.. but turn out only the AYCE sushi and rolls.. very disappointed.. ( ask what special fish or seafood they put today before you order takeaway combo)"}
{"text":"Love this place.  

I love their lunch special.  I always get L4 with all salmon sashimi and sushi and 2 jap chae's instead of the rice.  Amazing deal for $8.99! It of course comes with a miso soup and salad.  I love how they permit these subs which makes me want to come here even more. 

Dinner is a bit more expensive but well worth it.  I love how you always get the standard miso soup and salad but also a plate of jap chae and potatoes.  Recently had the chicken katsu donburi - delish! Pork bone soup - standard, a bit oily.  Sushi and sashimi - good.  

Definitely one of my go to places for decent Japanese food."}
{"text":"I've been to this place quite a few times now and they are great if you're not an AYCE lover. The prices are cheap and have a lot of variety.

I really like how they have a button on most tables where you can press and a server will show up. But I have also found that sometimes they ignore it also.

Their sashimi a pretty good and the tables are quite spacious. Washrooms can use a bit of help though. It's always best to show up before noon as that's when all the office workers show up and you'll be in line. The longest I've waited is 15 minutes so not so bad.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place was called gonoe sushi before. Recently it's changed to gal sushi. The menu is pretty much same as before except they raised prices for every single item. I remember we always ordered black dragon roll before, the food was decent with reasonable price. Now it's almost $18 for black dragon roll  with lots of rice ...It makes me doubt that if the restaurants changed the chef.We definitely won't go back again for sushi."}
{"text":"Love gals! Been here several times and I always have a great experience! Fish is fresh, service is fast, sushi is tasty!"}
{"text":"I first came here for the live octopus. It was a really fun experience, great way to practice your chopstick skills. 
We had a octopus, flounder combo and a boat, it was a bit too much for a table of 4 plus 2kids. They have a variety of sashimi you don't often see elsewhere. I would consider it slightly more expensive than your regular sushi place. 
Lobster roll taste amazing as well. 

The flounder sashimi, for me was quite dull. Maybe too much of only one type of fish.... The soup was good, came along with a grilled fish as well. 

Recommend as a dating place, live octopus can really get to a topic starting. And it's fun!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We always get Sushi1 and a korean dish. I tried their Kimchi chigae and it was awesome. Ive never had their lunch bentos but the prices are great if you can order by 3 pm

Please don't park in the fire route"}
{"text":"I've been here more than a few times for like 2 years now and its alright. Service is pretty good too. I do wish there were more side dishes. I recommend the salmon skin roll."}
{"text":"A great place for lunch!  Food is always fresh and yummy and service is generally prompt and attentive."}
{"text":"I like this place. A lot.

There were 7 of us, and infinite dishes at our table to sample. Appetizers included standard fair like Miso Soup and Edamame. We took it to the next level though with Agedashi Tofu and Takoyaki which were both, quite literally, the bomb diggity. Honestly, if I just had a plate of each, I would have called it a night. Sooo good!

I am a tad squeamish when it comes to Sashimi (I know, it's like get with the program, right?), but sampled the Uni because Iron Chef lead me to believe its the bomb. My friends couldn't handle it, but I ate it like a champ! Creamy, and fishy. Would I do it again? May be...not.

Spicy Salmon and Tempura Rainbow were my favourite rolls of the night, mostly because of the contrast of textures between all the elements. We also had the Spider, Gal's Tempura (not so good), Avocado, and California Rolls. 

But honestly, after 3 pieces of sushi, everything starts to taste the same, haha.

Thoroughly enjoyable experience, and the half an hour wait is a tell tale sign that is the it joint for sushi in Markham!"}
{"text":"Gal is located at a very convenient location, especially for those who work at the high tech companies nearby. At lunch time, this place is always packed. The food quality (sashimi, sushi) is not too bad. The portion is a bit on the small end. They should seriously fill at least half of the bowl with miso soup and give more rice in their bento boxes ..."}
{"text":"We had a sashimi dinner that was very much below par. It wasn't cheap but the sashimi was all flounder which is chewy and gross. Most sashimi platter that I had from other restaurants usually come with an assortment but this one only comes with one type of fish. The tempura shrimps were not fresh and even the thick batter couldn't mask the staleness. Then there was a pan seared fish which tastes bland and fishy. Last but not the least, the service stinks. I over heard customers complaining and the waitress was arguing with the customer. Not only do the chefs need to enroll in Culinary 101, the servers need to take Customer Service 101 course all over again!!"}
{"text":"The live octopus is a must try when you come to this place.  Pretty much the main attraction here. 
The live octopus dish was $28+ tax so it's a little bit pricey. It was kind of hard getting the tentacles stay on my chopstick and it doesn't have much of a taste on its own and is very chewy.  Make sure to dip it in a lot of sauce. Certainly it was a very unique experience.  The sashimi tasted pretty fresh but everything else was kind of average. Service was a bit on the slower side as it took awhile for all the cooked stuff to came out. On the other hand, all the raw stuff came out pretty quickly."}
{"text":"We tried this place based on the good review. It was after 8pm on Saturday, wasn't that busy however our waitress brought a wrong item and the sushi & sashimi we ordered were not good at all.  
(They don't know even how to make sushi rice.)

Very bad service, staff won't care unless you press \"the button\" as usual Korean restaurant service style. (Not even a tea refill at sushi restaurant!?) We were very disappointed about this place. Never go back there again."}
{"text":"Good food with decent price. Family friendly and spacious for groups. However, they should prioritize cleaning and setting of tables to shorten long line up at door."}
{"text":"I've been to Gal's Sushi for a couple years now but I've noticed the service and food quality are deteriorating recently.  

During my most recent visit, I ordered a bento box with rolls and sushi.  The crab salad roll was over-filled with their sauce and the tempura crumbs that they put inside is hard and dry (seems like it was from over-night left over) and it tasted different than in the past.

Anyways, my problem with them is when I pay the bill.  After paying the bill with my cc, the serve (whom I think is called Cindy....at least she's new) said to me that \"you didn't pay 10% service charge.\"  I said to her, \"what kind of services did you provide me\" and she replied \"I brought you the food\"....wow....since when was a 10% service charge a \"mandatory\" thing, if you provide great services, I have no problem giving 15%-20% but when I know the food quality as well as services of \"bring out the food only\" is poor, I don't think any service providing business deserve the \"suggested tipping\"."}
{"text":"I live very close to Gal's sushi and I have been here a few times as well as ordering take-out from this location. The food quality is generally good to very good so I do enjoy coming here. 

We would often get the sashimi and sushi combo. It is reasonably priced and the fish is fresh. We would also on occasion get the kitchen/bbq items which are also very good. Their Korean food is overpriced compared to some other Korean specific places like Nok Wan or Owl of Minera. Otherwise, overall, we enjoy eating here. 

The 3 stars however is because the service that I have received the few times I have been here. They are a very busy restaurant. At any given meal time (especially dinner), it is a given that you will have to wait for a table. Because of this, I would expect them to have more waitstaff at the place. They have 1 or 2 manager type and maybe 1 or 2 more waitstaff. Because of this, often you would have to wait to get someone's attention. 

It is always good to call for reservation when you can. Their take-out is good and they give a cash discount."}
{"text":"Mmmmm.... Gal's Sushi is my kinda Gal. Fresh, funky, and oh soooo finnneeee. A whopping platter of sushi was enough to share between five very hungry people, and though our eyes were a little bigger than our stomachs, we still found ourselves clanking chopsticks over who would get the last piece of butter fish and unagi. 

Good things to note:
1. This place gets really busy, even on a weekday night.
2. Like the \"doorbell\" system on each table to call for service (though a little impersonal, and actually not noticeably more efficient)
3. Sushi does NOT come with an overwhelming bed of rice. Each dainty piece of fish is nestled on a small cushion of rice, more like it. Who wants to get full on rice when going out for sushi?
4. Definitely leave room for their amazingly tasty and dark sesame ice cream.
5. Fish is fresh, and the spicy salmon roll is among the best I've tried."}
{"text":"Live octopus was interesting but not worth. I have ordered the chirashi dinner. The sashimi did seem fresh. Service was slow. Remember to make reservations for weekends!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

It's better than average. But where are the people?


We decided to order a couple of rolls for dinner. 

A Spicy Tuna and Dynamite Roll. 8 pieces each. 

Both rolls were expertly prepared and tasted pretty good too.  They weren't too packed with rice. But after eating a piece I noticed an error on the Dynamite Roll we ordered.  

It was missing spicy sauce and there was no salmon either. I distinctly remembered this detail and brought this to the attention of the waitress before eating any more. She went back to the bar to verify the menu and consult with the chef, and she came back and said that it was a misprint on the menu. Really? I don't know what to believe. The place has been around since Nov 2011, and they hadn't corrected a misprint yet. Seems fishy..

I mentioned to the waitress the reason why we ordered that roll was because it was 'different' we had never seen a Dynamite Roll offered with salmon in it before. She said she can bring us a Dynamite Roll with salmon. We agreed. 5 minutes later came out. . 


Just a note on the interior the private booths (East side) where we were initially seated become uncomfortably hot. The vent above forces hot dry air downward. Strange phenomenon the hot air hovers at neck level, robbing you of fresh air.  You're head is hot but the rest of your body cold.  Suggest you not to sit here. Sit on the left (West) side of the restaurant; I didn't see any of those vents there.

Atmosphere was dead. We were the only ones there Wednesday at 5-6pm. But they are open late until 12am. 

Concept is cool. Thought I'd never see the day of an Izakaya / Japanese Restaurant would grace Thornhill. And food quality is above average too."}
{"text":"I've been to the Gonoe location at Don Mills several times, and the Thornhill location is way busier. I couldn't get a reservation and decided to drop by at 5:30 pm on a Saturday and luckily landed a table. Line ups started to form by the door around 7:00pm.

The restaurant is located by the Red Lobster and Legend Chinese restaurant plaza just north of Yonge St. and Steeles Ave. Inside, there were mainly private booths with a small open area for large tables. By the bar, there were several aquariums with the live octopus, as well as buckets with sea cucumber and other seafood I did not recognize.

The menu has a combination of Japanese and Korean fare but what makes this location stand out is the specialty items they offer. They had a separate menu offering the chef special sashimi platter, and a specialty live seafood menu offering flounder, abalone, sea squirt, sea cucumber, gaebul (aka fat innkeeper worm) and live octopus. From the live seafood menu, our group ordered the live octopus ($28).

The live octopus is a must try for the experience. The octopus was bland by itself and had a chewy texture. The octopus was more enjoyable dipped in the sauce of sesame oil and salt, with an option to eat with the Korean hot sauce. We got over the initial fear factor and ended up eating the entire plate.

I was paranoid that if I didn't chew the octopus thoroughly, it would move inside my throat or I would choke, so I chewed every part of it several times. 

We also ordered a sashimi boat with 60 pieces, and a spider roll to share. I could have eaten it all myself because it was fresh and delicious. 

As for the service, I had to flag the servers down a few times. Our server was new, so there was a lot of confusion on how to split the bill, but hopefully that was a one time occurrence.

Overall:

A busy restaurant with menu items not seen at Gonoe's other locations and many other Japanese/Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"The first thing you'll notice as soon as you walk into Gal's is the great ambiance an the sushi bar's cleanliness. The fish looks fresh.

Portions are more than adequate and the sushibis extremely fresh and delicious. I'll definately be coming here again.

Prices are on par for a la carte sushi."}
{"text":"Been to this place many times.  I've had both the Japanese and Korean food.  I usually order the sushi trays with over 50 pieces.  Sometimes, I order the marinated ribs that comes with rice. Yum, very tasty.
I tried their bulgogi in a stone pot with rice, it was good but a little on the sweet side.  I've also been there during lunch times.  Sadly, the bulgogi in the lunch set box wasn't that great.  Pretty disappointing. =( I ordered the lunch set with the Grilled Salmon, but the salmon wasn't that great.  Compared to how the food tasted during my first few visits, the food quality seems to have changed.

In terms of service, pretty quick.  Once in a while they do forget what you asked of them- I.e. I asked the waiter to bring me a container and he/she forgets and I have to remind them."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner.  It was early - 6:15 so there wasn't a line up.  It had been a while since I've been there, so was surprised at the changes to the menu.  The prices have gone up and the bento box selections have decreased.  I usually have the bento box.

To start, the 'free' sides we receive with the meal is now reduced to 2 - noodles and potatoes.  

Among the 3 of us, 2 ordered bento boxes and 1 ordered the chicken teriyaki and rice plate.  The Bento boxes were OK - nothing special.  The chicken plate was OK also, even though half of the serving was bean sprouts.  Also, their rice serving is really small now.

There was a small amount of people waiting to be seated on an ongoing basis.  As a result, we felt rushed to leave.  Things were quickly cleared from our table, even before we were finished eating.  I saved my salad to eat at the end, only to see it quickly picked up and cleared with the used dishes.  Same with the noodles and potatoes.  

Our bill was promptly brought to us, without us asking for it.  I asked where was the dessert that we would normally get.  The server / hostess showed me the 3 tiny candies in the bill case and told me that was now the dessert.  I said, so the prices went up and we now get less?  She said yes, that's the economy.  By the way, one of the candy was open so we wouldn't even eat that.

While getting ready to leave, the lady was standing up in the background with her wet cloth, waiting for us to leave to clean the table.

For the pricing, service, and meal, I will not be returning here.  Not worth the value.  This use to be one of my go to places for Japanese, but not anymore.  There are other places out there that is much better and more reasonably price."}
{"text":"This one is a above average level sushi restaurant. It has a exclusive vegetarian section to choose. The sweet ginger and soy sauce are almost authentic, the veggie rolls are tasty and not very pricy, good to know and had a very cozy sushi experiences, besides, you can also eat your alone as their sushi bar are also snug:) but they don't have pay in cash with 10 percent off anymore, what a pity, and the waiters is not as good as their waitresses:(, need to be improved."}
{"text":"The food and service overall is pretty good here. However, I suggest going for lunch because it's a better deal. The prices for dinner is ridiculous. Also, don't order takeout for takeout unless you have to, you don't get any complimentary side dishes like you would if you dined in."}

I first tried this restaurant back in February for the first time and have gone back more than 5 times with different people.  That is what happens when you upload a photo of fresh sashimi/seafood on twitter and everyone wants to check it out.

Gonoe serves your regular sushi, sashimi and udon but that's not what people were going crazy over.  It was the Korean fluke (Gwang-Uh) sashimi, sea cucumber and live octopus that people were wondering about.

Fresh seafood is easily accesible and cheap in Korea where they are surrounded by ocean and I am sure that's something all Koreans miss living in Toronto.
Korean sashimi, especially this specific type of fish (Gwang-Uh) is firmer in texture and very chewy.

At Gonoe they have a special that comes with a plate of Gwang-Uh sashimi, plate of fresh seafood that consists of sea cucumber, abalone, sea pineapple, live octopus and sea snail, tempura, grilled fish, spicy seafood soup, rice, dessert and bottle of soju- all for $139.99 This easily feeds 4~6 people depending on how much fresh seafood you can eat! 

From the 5 seafood plate, my favorite is sea cucumber- it is very chewy in texture and I like it with the Cho Jang (spicy sauce). If you've never tried live octopus, it is def an experience. It is not exactly alive, they chop it up into little pieces but the legs still squirm and move around on the plate.. well, ok I guess that means it's still alive. Just be careful when you put it in your mouth because it will sometimes stick to insides of your mouth.

After all the seafood fest, they will then serve you spicy seafood soup, grilled fish and some rice. Time for some carbs!!

If you don't drink or don't like soju, you can ask them to give you rolls instead.

Summary: This is a must try if you love fresh Korean seafood- if you haven't, it is a good place to start. There is no doubt the seafood is fresh since it is served raw and the live octopus is something to try once in your life time. Do keep in mind that this restaurant gets super busy and it seems like they never have enough servers to handle all the table. So feel free to press the bell that's on the corner of your table or flag them down (it is not rude)."}
{"text":"This is probably the most cost efficient restaurant I've been in a long while. I Love their lunch bento box, tried their Sashimi lunch and it's absolutely amazing. The proportion and mixture of Sashimi, rice, vegetables and sushi are just right for me. Cannot expect anything more, must try!"}
{"text":"Sushi is okay but the restaurant gets really busy towards the end of the work week. You can order Japanese and Korean dishes but I felt like sushi that day. Ordered the sushi and tempura lunch special but asked for California rolls instead of sushi. It also comes with salad and miso soup when you done in. The ratio of servers to guest seems never enough so we usually let the server know that we only have an hour for lunch and to try and expedite our meal quicker."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look f act or anything and it's a bit pricey but their food is absolutely delicious. The fish and seafood doesn't smell or state fishy. It was on point. Delicious delicious delicious. We tried a couple of dishes. 
The place is busy and packed so make sure you arrive and put your name down. But it's defiantly with it 

Live squid: definitely a great food experience. The squid comes from the I house rank they have. It tastes good with the hot sauce they give you. It's chewy and bland without the sauce. But it defiantly made the dinner interesting. 28$ 

I attached pictures and description."}
{"text":"When I'm sick and tired of poor quality sashimi at All-You-Can-Eat places, Gal Sushi is my go-to Japanese restaurant. 

Prices are decent, and sashimi is always fresh and well presented. The sushi combos are big enough to share for two people, and you might still have room to order one of their Korean dishes. 

Gal's Sushi is always packed when I visit, even as late as 9:30PM! The service is fast, efficient and courteous. The tables, however, are always still wet from the wipe cloth (?) so my cup of tea slides around the table by itself unless I wipe it down with a napkin. 

Though they need to improve on keeping the restaurant as a whole clean, I've never had any unhygienic encounters with the food itself. 

There's plenty of parking in the plaza, and you can enter through their back doors if you don't want to walk around to the front entrance. 

Thumbs up for complimentary red bean cake and orange for dessert! Side dishes are also complimentary, but there's nothing special about them to comment on - standard kimchi, salad & bean sprouts."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant ever since i moved up to Markham. I love how they have both Korean and Japanese dishes since my BF and I love both types of food.

I like how they are so quick and efficient when you order food. I love their tofu soup probably the best in the Markham area. Their sushi lunch boxes come with a good selection and variety. Can't go wrong with L2 the sashimi box.

This is one place i can always count on for good sushi."}
{"text":"I just had a dinner with my mom and daughter few days ago. 
It's still very crowded at nights that we shall start the dinner earlier to get a table.  WE ended up sat on the sushi bar instead of waiting outside. 
The service was good (the manager served us this time, he was truly friendly and good in service).  
WE ordered a Salmon Teriyaki dinner, Sashimi platter (SU1) and my mom ordered a Korean OX bone soup (Seolleong Tang).

Salmon Teriyaki Dinner: The sauce was not rich enough, and the Salmon was a bit over cooked.  It's a big dish though (two big pieces of salmon with bean sprouts underneath)

Sashimi Platter: This was good as it has UNI sushi there! (My fav!)  The fish was quite fresh and I liked them put lots of washibi inside the rice!! 

Korean OX Bone Soup: My mom was quite disappointed with the beef inside, because she thought it's meat with bone , but it came up as pieces of beef stew like ... 

The salad that they gave us as appetisers was good, but the salad dressing was not rich enough, somehow, just like the Teriyaki sauce for Salmon dinner, it felt like water added to the sauce... :( 


The place was very noisy too... 
It may be better to buy take out Sashimi / sushi  combo ... 
but not eat in."}
{"text":"Yummy!! Love the crispy spicy salmon, and crunchy roll. The side dishes were really good too. Loved the service."}
{"text":"I visited with my family and ordered a few appetizers and a medium size sushi platter.
Their food tasted great. Tempura had the right amount of batter and tasted great. The beef tataki was smaller than I had liked though, considering the price. The sushi platter was great because it had little bit of everything. Salmon, tuna, and eel sushi all tasted fresh and good. There were a few that I could not name but they were still amazing. Rolls were also soft and had a generous amount of ingredients in them. The sea urchin roe sushi tasted especially great. I definitely think that we got our money's worth.
The only issue I had was that the servers told us on two occasions that they would give us the ice cream at the end of the meal. We felt that they were encouraging us to finish the meal. I did not expect this since we were eating for only about an hour. We were a group of 3 and spent about $130 including the tip. It must have been a busy night for them.
The food was great and we enjoyed our time in the restaurant. I will consider visiting them again when it's not busy and I have some money to spend."}
{"text":"Our family went for dinner at this place yesterday. Everyone had massive food poisioning afterwards.

Didnt have problem with this place before, but after today i dont think i can trust the chef and the cleanliness or the freshness of their fish.

Be warned"}
{"text":"Came here for the $145 live seafood dinner combo, the main draw being the live octopus (as I'm sure it is for many diners here)! 

So let's cut to the chase: I feel it tasted like nothing.  Just squiggly bits of tentacles, more chewy and tough than the typical cooked octopus, and a bit slimy.  Seriously, boiled chicken has more pronounced flavour.  The only flavours I really got were from the spicy(ish)-sweet sauce that comes from a plastic squeezie bottle or sesame-salt dipping sauce - both of which I liked, by the way, but the octopus itself had no taste in itself.

Other live/(\"odori\"-style, if you're familiar with the Japanese type live kind of seafood) seafood you'll receive as part of the set: 
- Abalone: My favourite of the set, it's got a toothsome quality kind of like a very thick-cut geoduck...but not as tasty as geoduck, IMHO...
- Sea cucumber: It looks so slimy on the plate, but it's actually quite sturdy and tough.
- Sea pineapple/sea squirt: Very slimy, squishy, briney and ... ammonia-y.  Um, I'm not doing a very good job of selling this one.
- Sea... ... Slug?: Uh, I don't even know what this was. Chopped up, it looked like bits of chitterlings (cooked/fried pork intestines). It tasted like...um...um...I can't even remember.
- The head of the octopus, whose body you just ate raw!
- One whole flounder: Wrap it up in your choice of leaf (lettuce, large shiso/perilla, or ssukgat/chrysanthemum leaves), stick some sauce on it with optional raw garlic slices and jalapeno, and eat it. Since it's filleted immediately before it's served to you, don't expect Japanese-styled sashimi, which has been given time to develop flavour. This one is more fishy, and has firmer textured flesh.

Other things you'll get in the set:
- A spicy fish soup made with the flounder head/bones 
- A tempura set of about 4-5 shrimp and a few vegetables

It's exactly a bad deal, but I feel like this was more of an \"experience\" type of meal than one where I had really enjoyed the flavours.  I'm glad I tried it, but all in all I'd say it was all relatively bland."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi spots!!  Quality of sushi has always remained good (unlike some other restaurants whose food go downhill after becoming popular).  It's a la carte style and the prices are also very good given the size of the trays and pieces of sushi/sashimi they serve.  Service is so-so, but I like the food so much that I can forgive that.  It also gets very busy so I recommend making reservations or going early.  I always bring friends and family here for sushi and they never disappoint!  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Gal's is always a great place for lunch when it comes to craving bento boxes at a reasonable price. Majority of their lunch specials are around $12. 

My go-to is always the L4 sushi and sashimi lunch set as I feel like it is one of the healthier and money worth choices. I usually ask for substitutions for my rice and maki rolls. I usually sub rice with their potatoes and maki with just California or spicy salmon (no extra cost). 

The staffs are always accommodating and friendly. If you're coming at lunch hours, make sure you get here early so you can beat the line as it does get super busy."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here. The live octopus is an interesting experience but not particularly flavorful. So to try is great but I probably wouldn't do it again. 

The price point is on the high end but I do find their fish to taste better and the slicing to be more consistent then a lot of the other places. Generally, Sushi has been pricier fare until all you can eats came a long so the prices aren't exactly jarring for the quality of sushi you're getting. 

All in all if I wanted the quality fish, with comfortable seating I hit up this place I spend about the same amount at an AYCE place and be just as full. 

The service is generally friendly although they are always busy so if you're looking for an intimate dining experience where the wait staff is attentive it won't be this place. Other than when you need something they mostly leave you alone. Tea cup was always full which is how I figure we've been taken care of. 

Happy fooding!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, fresh sushi, great music.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars, because their lamps are extremely dusting and I felt uncomfortable eating around so much dust."}
{"text":"This place and the sadistic pukes that run it are an embarrassment to Canada. What kind of a human slime do you have to be to cut the tentacles off of a live, very intelligent octopus and serve the writhing appendage to sum bag diners. I hope this dump burns to the ground for it."}
{"text":"Visited Gal's Sushi this Sunday. We were a group of 4. We ordered an A4 Sushi and Rolls combo and a Veggie Roll set.
The sushi/rolls were okay. The fish wasn't as fresh as the last time.
We were delighted with the taste and freshness of their sushi last time we were here. But this experience wasn't as good."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite sushi place in the hood but n our last visit all four of us were disappointed. The service was still good and friendly and the tampura was ok cause hard to get deep fried wrong. The sushi and sashimi that my wife and I ordered was not good. The salmon pieces were thick, chewy and not the cleanest cut.  I mean every peace had that skin/vein stuff on it. I eat a lot sushi and I know this didn't go down wright.  We also got some chicken teryaki. That was like white chicken breast barbecued hours ago without seasoning and now served with warm teryaki sauce over it. Nothing was prepared with the least finnes. I expected much more from Gal. They used to be do good."}
{"text":"A favourable review because I was pleased with their service. 

Overall, it's the higher end alternatives like Japango and Ja Bistro are literally just way beyond Gonoe's league. This is a good spot for people who enjoy their California and shrimp tempura (cooked) rolls. 

The sushi and sashimi aren't top grade, so if that's you're thing you won't be happy here! Quality is about the same as AYCE... EXCEPT the uni was shockingly super fresh and scrumptious. 

All the dishes were really beautifully presented, especially the large boat that we ordered! 

Fun experience for anyone that wants to try live squirming octopus, though I didn't. 

Good prices, good service, good presentation, but sashimi quality definitely not for the sushi connoisseur!"}
{"text":"The fish is fresh and the sushi and sashimi taste good. It's just the line up is a bit long."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. A few years back when it had first opened it was a great place for decently priced Japanese/Korean food. Came here recently and found the quality has decreased. 

There's no parking in the front of the plaza where Gal's is, you will have to park in the main parking area or underground and walk around. The decor is a typical Japanese restaurant though I will say there are lots of tables and the restaurant is always lively. There are decently priced lunch and dinner combos and will come with Korean glass noodles, rice, soup and salad. 

The sashimi in my combo today was thinly sliced with little to no fish flavour.  Texture felt a bit odd so I ended up not eating  all of it. The sushi looked like it was falling apart.  The plates and soup bowls are lined red interior and the ink/paint is peeling off badly. Not only does this make it look dated, I also feel like the paint might go into my food. Please replace your bowls and plates."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting too much from this place at first, but after seeing many pictures of the Sil's Combo (Chef's special combos), I was quite interested in trying this restaurant! My family and I came here once before, but we got the individual lunch bentos.

We didn't think that we'd get miso soup, salad, or banchan with just a simple order of the Sil's Combo - therefore, we were pleasantly surprised when the waitress came with all three! Great customer service on the part of management, given that typically only sets have such sides. It was excellent timing too, especially since we were starving and since the food ended up arriving so late (it gave us something to eat and munch on while waiting). 

The combo came with many different types and varieties of fish! In terms of sashimi, there were fatty salmon belly, salmon, ika (cuttlefish), tuna, red snapper, tako (squid), capelin roe, akagai (surf clam), and some identified red fish similar to swordfish. The capelin roe was so subtly sweet and delicious, and the salmon belly just melted in your mouth! It was an absolute pleasant surprise and was amazing.

The nigiri sushi options were eel, salmon, red snapper, tuna, scallop, and uni. The eel was unbelievably moist and fatty as well, and marinated just right. The scallop was very sweet, but unfortunately, I put a bit too much wasabi and soy sauce - which then covered the sweetness completely. The uni was okay - not the best I've ever had. It was sweet enough and extremely creamy, but a bit too fishy. Overall, still one of the better sea urchins I've had though. 

There were also 12 pieces of rolls - 6 were dynamite rolls, and the remaining 6 were red dragon rolls. By the end of it all, I was so stuffed! But very happy, since my sushi cravings were completely and wholly satisfied. :)"}
{"text":"Actual rating: 4.5 stars

My family's favourite spot to get Japanese or Korean food. We've been here several times & have had consistently positive experiences. The customer service is always excellent & they serve several complimentary dishes at the beginning of the meal (e.g. miso soup). 

There's an excellent selection of options on the menu. Don't let the name of the restaurant fool you - even though they specialize in sushi, there are also plenty of noodle dishes and Korean eats as well as several offerings for vegetarians. The vegetable udon is delicious, as are the Philadelphia Roll, Spicy Salmon Roll, Salmon Avocado Roll, and Yam Roll. 

Prices are on par with similar-quality sushi restaurants. Only caution: Gal's is a popular place & there can be a line-up, especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy this place at all. Only came for the live octopus which was just.. Live octopus (slimy and salty). Everything else wasn't fresh or extremely underwhelming. They seared the hotate to mask the fact that it's not fresh. The \"toro\" felt like chewing on cling wrap. Unagi tasted like packaged. Ika was meh. 

Will definitely not come back."}
{"text":"This was one of my worst experience.
We ordered udon sushi and Korean bolgogi.
Udon was cold and tasteless, sushi was falling apart, rice was bad too!
Services was bad too, waited for a long time to get seated and take food order. 
It was costly, and have been asked for tips!
Worst experience! Not recommended at all!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today and I've got to say that this place is really good! It's value during lunch is awesome, with specials that range from $8.99 to $11.99. Two of my friends ordered the roll bento, one of my friends ordered the roll and sushi bento, and I ordered the sashimi bento and a uni handroll to start.



Soup and salad came out first of course, and you can usually tell when a Japanese restaurant is higher or lower tier based on how they make their salads. The lowest tier places just give you a few shreds of lettuce and slather some sauce on top and call it a day. Some places add some shredded red cabbage or carrot. Gal's had both of these additions and also a fresh slice of tomato on top, along with some sesame and black pepper. It's not a BIG deal, but with restaurants, sometimes it's the small things that set you apart from the rest.

The Uni hand roll came and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the seaweed they used. Sometimes seaweed can be just a bit too chewy and not crispy enough. That's a sign that the seaweed has been left out too long and has perhaps absorbed some of the moisture in the air. This seaweed was perfectly crispy and there was no struggle to bite it off while eating the roll. Once again, the small things! The uni was also very fresh, with a clean, fresh flavor that left no odd aftertaste. Sometimes, bad uni can leave a disgusting taste in your mouth, so always be careful!

My bento arrived with four pieces of salmon, one delicious piece of salmon belly, one piece of BC Tuna, two pieces of red snapper, three slices of tuna (not the regular red maguro. It's what the cheaper Japanese restaurants will call toro, and is pinker in color), and three pieces of escolar. It also came with two fried veggie maki, 3 imitation crab maki with a mayonnaise, and 3 pieces of california maki. There were also some appetizers on the side (potatoes in sweet, tangy sauce and chap chae) and rice. For $8.99, the quality you get can not be beat at all. It is quite filling and all the fish was very fresh. Normally, red snapper tastes gross, overly fishy and metallic, but this red snapper had a light and pleasant, slightly salty flavor to it. 

I've been to a lot of Japanese restaurants all over Toronto, and I've got to say that Gal's Sushi definitely offers one of the best deals for lunch time! I'll probably post a review when i go back there to try dinner. For now, good eats and I hope this review will help you!"}
{"text":"I'd like to say this is the most consistent Japanese/Korean restaurant throughout the years it's been opened. Food is always decent, service is good and although they are quite busy most of the time, they're quick so the wait usually isn't too long but should make reservations just in case.
We usually order the sashimi/sushi platter and it's a good variety. They also have a few side dishes, salad and soup that comes with the meal. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is actually 1.5 stars. My family I have been a regular, long time customer here at this establishment. My extended family and I (10-12 people) would come here for most of our celebratory/holiday dinners. This used to be my fav spicy salmon place, but over the years, I have seen the quality of food decline ( very inconsistent in their flavouring - same item ordered separately on the same night tasted fundamentally different). But most of all, the service on my last few visits have been awful - inattentive, slow, and careless. There was a beverage spill that did not get cleaned up for the entire duration of our meal. 

Tldr: for this kind of price point, I expect better service and consistency in flavours. Feels more like a business transaction than a restaurant experience."}
{"text":"very impressed with their service and level of dedication to their customers.

been here twice now and had an awesome experience both times.

the management was very accommodating and the staff were able to answer any questions we had.

we got the soup, salad, tempura and the specialty cloud rolls - by far the best tasting sushi ever!"}
{"text":"this is my go to place for a la carte sushi, and they have amazing house made dumplings(gyoza). For me this would be best value for money, you get salad,soup and some 
appys with every order."}
{"text":"I love coming back here for the sushi bento boxes and the side dishes that accompanies the bulgogi. However, this place is always packed during lunch hours, so you will have to wait a short while before you can get a table.

Sushi is not particularly good nor bad, but the size of the dishes will certainly make you extremely full! I always need to takeout my leftovers since I can never finish it! 

Waiters are always busy and they don't pay attention to the bell service."}
{"text":"My first time here with 2 other friends.  We came for lunch on Saturday and it was pretty busy.   I thought the service was friendly and servers were quick.   The price is fair and the food we ordered was very fresh.  We ordered a small sushi and sashimi boat, beef tataki, seafood udon soup, and fresh live octopus. Yup we saw a picture of a live octopus so we had to try it!  It comes to our table already cut up but the tentacles were still moving around. They were squirming around and actually sucked themselves onto the plate.  It took some effort to pry them off the plate. Haha. Once you got them off the plate an into your mouth, the taste was actually pretty bland.  You have to dip into the hot sauce or soy sauce.  It was fun to eat but now that I've experienced it, I'll just order the other stuff.   The sashimi, udon and beef tataki was fresh and very tasty.  A great little spot."}
{"text":"I come here every couple of months for the past few years and I must say they are doing pretty well (i.e. maintained the food quality and portion) while also adding new dishes/options to their menu. 

They are typically pretty busy despite having a fair number of tables. Would recommend coming there slightly before the peak lunch/dinner hours just to avoid the potentially long lineup."}
{"text":"Generally I am skeptical of Korean Japanese restaurants because they end up not doing either food group justice. We had a business lunch there, and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food, menu creativity like lobster tempura maki roll.. And the balance of \"Japanese\" and \"Korean\" food with excellent flavours. The service was very good as well, which can be lacking in Markham restaurants. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Been here throughout the years and the quality seems to have gone downhill.  Place is always busy so I guess that is why.  Fish is okay quality but not the freshest.  I usually stick to the maki rolls here.  The Party tray is the best deal.  The plaza can be tricky to park but they do have an underground parking.  Service is okay here not much to rave about."}
{"text":"Have been there only twice, and their food is good. 

As a uni (sea urchin) fan, the price for sea urchin is too good comparing with lots of other sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday. Place was packed. Definitely attracts more customers than it used to. Two years ago when I came for a weekday dinner there wasn't as many people.

Fish was really fresh and sliced to a adequate thickness. Lunch bentos are definitely worth it. $10 and you get a box enough to fill you up. Dinner is a bit more pricey with similar stuff. So maybe lunch is more worth it.

Service was close to none. The bare minimum. Servers are not attentive and walk by you when you try to say \"excuse me\". Sometimes I just don't like having to wave my arms in the arm for an extended period of time. That would be its main downfall. Maybe there just wasn't enough servers? 
 
All in all I wouldn't come back unless someone suggested they specifically want to go here. Worth a try? I guess so if you're in the area! The lunches are worth it."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday for lunch with a party of 8. It was starting to get busy but the service was great! The food was really good as well and really good value for what you get. Highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my fiancé and her friend from out of town. The service was excellent and friendly. Had a great boat of sashimi and sushi, that came with miso and starter mini salad. All the fish tasted clean and delicious. Definitely one of the better places I've been to."}
{"text":"Had a regular family dinner on a Monday night, mixed diet restrictions. For seven, we ordered the small sashimi and sushi boat, chicken udon (soup), chicken yaki udon (fried), beef teriyaki and black cod. The portion was good, as miso soup, green salad, appetizers, and green tea ice cream were on the house alongside our meals. Appetizers were Korean glass noodles, pickled turnip, pickled greens, and kimchi - signature as the store was operated by Koreans. 

Everything came out timely-the right temperature for everything. Plating looked great, just the table got a bit cramped as we were already a party of seven seated at a six-person table.

The sashimi and sushi \"boat\" came on a square plate, with a good variety of items. The sashimi was not particularly flavourful, but I was grateful that nothing was frozen. The sushi was proportionate and stayed intact between bites-a good sign. Of the items I had, nothing stood out to me.

The udons were flavourful and had many toppings - lots of spring onion, seaweed strips, panko, parsley...a bit much for my personal preference.

The beef teriyaki and black cod both each came with a bowl of rice as they were \"mains\". Half the beef teriyaki was too tough, but the other half was cooked to the desired medium and was soft. Served on a bed of onions and peppers, and topped with two sprigs of asparagus, the vegetables created a refreshing flavour. The black cod was similarly plated and was also very flavourful - I preferred the cod over the beef.

Near the end of our meal we were offered a steamed salmon head half on the house, cooked with what looked like spicy kimchi sauce. Upon tasting it, the salmon head was soft and moist, and the spice gave an interesting kick of flavour that was easy to stomach for all.

Overall-a safe, uneventful choice for simple \"Japanese\" dinner with family, will have return to check out the much discussed flounder special and live octopus..."}
{"text":"Best sushi pizza I've had from downtown to Thornhill. First visit our waiter was so friendly and fun. Subsequent visits generally the same cold reception as other sushi places... Maybe 1 degree warmer. Great food quality though. Yum!"}
{"text":"I love gals sushi!! I recommend going during lunch time and ordering a lunch box set. They are like $10, and you get SOOO much food . I'm not a sushi expert so I don't know what considered really good Sushi for expert standards. BUT, this sushi in my opinion is very good :):)"}
{"text":"3.5 
Pretty good Korean run Japanese restaurant. Get the best choice trays as it comes with uni, toro, salmon belly, and ebi. 
The rice is on point too. 
If you pay in cash for take out, you can save on the taxes. 
Ps parking is brutal. There's underground parking but that is complicated."}
{"text":"I always come for dinner with friends because I love the quality of sashimi here. Service is perfect, there's a button to press when you need something and they come promptly. Otherwise you are left alone, which I like. 

Dinner is a la carte and can get pricey if you want the premium stuff (sea urchin!) and other assorted sashimi. 

I'll put pics of my last dinner up. This place is my go to for a la carte sushi dinner.

On another note, I have to rave about the lunch I get from here. I normally get it to go on my lunch break. 

Lunch special has a great value. My fave is the 10.99 sashimi/sushi/roll bento box. I wish I had a picture handy, but I always eat it as soon as I get it! It comes with 10+ pcs of sashimi, 4 pcs of sushi, 6 rolls. 

What I love about this box is the sashimi is always so fresh and the right temperature. You get salmon, red tuna, snapper and .. white tuna? The sushi has wasabi in it (can be requested without). One pc is salmon, another is ebi (shrimp) , one white pc of marinated fish, one non marinated white fish (can't rmb what they were). The rolls were 2 spicy salmon rolls, 2 maki rolls (can't rmb the fish) and what I think was a deep fried futo maki roll. 

I also got just the right amount of rice for the sashimi and jap chae (glass noodles mixed with sesame oil). 

I would recommend getting this lunch special (L4) to anyone who loves sushi. The quality and quantity matches the dinner menu and for the price, it can't be beat! Over twenty pcs for 10.99!!

And there's free parking underground if there's nothing above ground."}
{"text":"I love their sushi! :) 
I always come here to get the $8.99 special sashimi (from 12-3pm i think) such a good deal! I could never finish it too..!! 
Their sashimi is nice and smooth and also cold! and fresh! Yum!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the Korean dishes more than the Sushi. The sushi rolls are average in my opinion.... but sashimi better. Prices are good and you get a lot of value. Chicken teriyaki  also very good. Service is good and they have a silent bell at each table to get the attention of your server. Three stars for the sushi and four stars for the entrees.  Been here about 10 times with both service and food consistent. Parking can be tricky and is in the back of the complex."}
{"text":"Fresh sashimi, reasonable price. I've been a regular customer for two years."}
{"text":"After getting snowed in nearby this sushi joint we didn't have much of a choice on where to eat as this was the only half decent place we could walk too.
Despite the snow storm the place had steady flow of customers with some going for a take out and some opting to dine in.
A somewhat larger group of 10 people we had to wait a bit to be seated.
After that it was smooth sailing. The menu is a mix of Korean and Japanese items so if you are ever in a discussion where the group is divided in choosing Japanese or Korean food this place a decent compromise.  I ordered a spicy tuna roll and the chef's sushi dinner. I also added a large Sapporo as I have had long day of work and needed to unwind. 
Following my lead the rest of the group also ordered spicy tuna rolls (I said myself oh great the chef is now going to take care to prepare 10 ordered of spicy tuna in one go!) 
Food arrived in reasonable amount of time with the service being erratic as sometime we would have to chase a server to give us water while at other times we would have several servers asking if we needed anything with a short span. 
The food looked appetizing but was nothing special, just your run of mill generic sushi. 
2.5 stars overall."}
{"text":"This place is my goto lunch. The value on the lunch bento boxes are just superb! The quantity and quality for what you pay for is just amazing. The fish is fresh and the rolls are stuffed! Flavours are on point and would recommend this place to everyone. The dinner selections are a bit more pricey, but still okay. 

The service here is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a lunch bento for $8.99. The sashimi was fresh and the portions sizes were generous for the price.  You also get a miso soup and green salad to start. 

If I worked closer this would definitely be my regular go to place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in Markham."}
{"text":"Third time here. Order the same thing but sadly this time they don't have uni:(

As usual, fresh and tasty, the waitress even let us to select what to replace the uni. 

The only con is : when we asked for the bill and push the servals time no one comes in and serve us. We ended up go and catch one of the waitresses for our bill. The owner may need to hiring some more people to help out the situation"}
{"text":"Had to drive to Markham for some business so dropped by this place for dinner. The rolls were very stuffing with thin rice layer. Ingredients were fresh too. Good layout and service. 

Will definitely revisit next time when around."}
{"text":"Got the best choice platter. Good variety. Pieces were a but small, but it is reflected in the price of the platter, so it was actually good value, considering that the platter included scallops and uni. The service was a bit slow, despite the restaurant being half empty.

Quality: 7.5/10. Service: 7/10. Value: 9/10. Overall: 8/10 (not an average)."}
{"text":"Pricey sushi boats and fish is average. Paying more for location and atmosphere than service and food, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Imagine you're going out for food with friends and can't decide between Korean and Japanese food... Well Gals is the place for you! 

One of the better places that serves both cuisines, albeit a bit pricey for certain things. Usually end up going for the lunch and/or dinner combos, as it comes out to a better deal. The side dish with the potatoes are my favourite though! 

Service is always pretty good, and each table comes with a service bell that gets a server's attention. Always comes in handy! Overall a goos place from time to time!"}
{"text":"I was really upset ordering a sashimi box for lunch and there were two pieces of white tuna. I'm not the biggest fan of white tuna but the worst part was that in both pieces, there were bones in it. 

How do you have sashimi with bones in it? And in both of the pieces.. Also, the quality of the salmon was underwhelming. 

I came back one more time and had their Chirashi. That was alright. For its price I think was $17, it was OK."}
{"text":"When i got to this place it was packed. I didn't have to wait to be seated. I ordered from the lunch special. L4 Sashimi, Sushi, Roll Box which was $7.99. I waited 5-10 minutes for my food!?! while the person next to me got theirs first when i ordered before them. The Sashimi was thinly sliced! I think my thumb was bigger than the sashimi. The rolls fell all over the placed and was messy to eat and the  sushi was super tiny with   tiny bit of rice. 
The only good thing about this place was the decor. Nice and Clean. The service was just okay. The food was okay as well i wouldn't say it was \"fresh\" in my opinion."}
{"text":"love this place, authentic cuisine, timely and fast service. never a bad experience. highly recommend if you don't mind paying a little more for professionaly done a la carte korean/ japanese food"}
{"text":"Seriously sad that this is no longer run by previous owners which was then called Gonoe! 

The chef was so much more original and unique with his creations and rolls. Prices of course have increased but not exactly for better quality. 

Decided to come try their food again hoping to relive my love for Gonoe  Had Udon noodles, tempura , Orangeville Roll( supposed to ve filled with Scallops but nowhere to be found) Scallop Sashimi and Botan Ebi. 

BEWARE!!! The freshness is hit or miss. I had gotten really bad reaction to the Botan Ebi( most likely not handled properly, instant swollen throat / itching) the Hotate was fine and fresh. 

As well as the other items I suppose but still doesn't match the same quality as before when Gonoe was around. Cold dishes they give complimentary looked dried out and like they'd been refrigerated for 3 weeks lol. 

Their presentation is lovely for the Sashimi and Rolls I will give them that. 


They have really got to work on the cleanliness of this place. Tables and seating was so greasy and sticky! No body has been cleaning around here I would say. And Yes didn't help that the old Korean lady was yelling at the staff for the whole 1 hour hahaha extremely terrifyingly loud.

Overall I cannot reccomend this place anymore. PLEASE be careful of freshness. If their dining room and cutlery isn't clean than how clean do you think they are with your food ?"}
{"text":"The odd thing about this place is a few years ago I used to eat here a LOT for their Korean food and sushi, then management changed and it went downhill.  The Kalbi tang used to be delish but then had bad meat and the soup base was just salt water instead of a broth, and the sushi was terrible.  Tiny fish and a LOT of rice and it wasn't the freshest either.  I gave it a few more chances and it was consistently bad after being so good.  So I didn't go back for maybe a couple of years.  A lot of my friends who used to be regulars thought the same and stopped going to Gal's as well.  

It wasn't until my coworkers dragged me back after me protesting how bad this place was.  Well something changed again for the better, because I now eat lunch here at least once every 2 weeks with my coworkers.  The quality of sushi is good and fresh but not superb - had softer sashimi where it melts in your mouth elsewhere.  You really can't beat the price though.  I always eat the same thing - L4.  Sashimi, sushi, 1 roll (6 pieces), noodles, rice, soup and salad for 8.99!  The other thing I really love about this place is that they allow you to substitute the fish with no extra charge.  I change the sushi and sashimi to all salmon and the roll to spicy salmon.  I've had some places charge an extra $2 for substitutions.  I don't know if they would charge if you substituted all to a more expensive fish though.  Salmon I think is the cheapest one, so why would places charge you extra to put cheaper fish on your plate?  

This place gets really busy at lunch but there are many tables so you usually don't have to want too long to be seated.  

I've had a roller coaster of a ride with Gal's but glad it's back at the top."}
{"text":"Celebrated my roommates birthday in a Saturday evening. Love the sushi boat! I like it when the sashimi is a big piece and the rice underneath is only a small portion. always a mouthful of meat with a complementary bite of rice. Legit. the flounder combo was okay.. like not amazing. but the way of eating the flounder sashimi was interesting. you rolled it with pieces of vegetables, and there were two different dipping sauce to choose from. besides, i also added the glass noodle that came underneath the sashimi to the roll, gave it crispy yet jelly texture. i would say the sushi boat is 5/5, really love the variety and volume (we ordered large). 
what gonoe could improve on is customer service. it seemed the ratio of waitress/ tables was low that sometimes they were too busy to take care of you."}
{"text":"Regular lunch place we go to.  Their bento boxes are fairly good. Sushi and sashimi here is not bad.  Would definitely recommend and come back."}
{"text":"Being from the states and currently located in buffalo we went in search for some good sushi and sashimi and Korean good. We got a combo I believe, my husband ordered. Had the live octopus tentacles for the first time and it was so fresh! The sashimi was fresh as well and everything was amazing :) the servers were very nice and making sure we had everything we needed. Well go back again!!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. I was craving something and it just ruined my night when I did not get it. 

Ordered rolls with the rest of our dinner. Our food arrived, but no rolls. Waited for 20 mins to ask about them and was told \"Sorry, I forgot to order them\"... fine... mistakes happen. Was told they would be right out. 15 mins later, we asked again if they were ready. Was then told \"Sorry, they were not ordered\". The waitress then offered to order them now and get them to go for us. What kind of solution is that? I don't know about you, but I like to eat all of my dinner at once. 

Will never be going back."}
{"text":"Slightly above average to good sushi, but not exceptional. Gals does the job to fill a craving. Lunch specials are the best deals.

Service has gone downhill and sometimes the staff can be outright rude."}
{"text":"Hands down the best prices and best tasting sushi in the GTA!  

I've been going to Gal's for years and years, love getting a seat at the sushi bar where I can see the sushi chefs work their magic.  

The A7 platter is a great value!  Super fresh, very flavorful.  Don't change!"}
{"text":"I love this place and order the same thing pretty much everytime!  Either the dolsot bibimbap (rice with veggies and beef in a hot stone pot) or the dukbaegi bulgogi (rib eye beef in a hot stone pot with rice). It's actually a good idea to share these between two people because the bibimbap doesn't come with much meat so u can get your protein fix from the bulgogi.  The bulgogi also comes with a few slices of rice cake and some clear noodles inside.  The galbi (beef short ribs) are really good here too.

For starters they bring you a small dish of japchae (clear noodles with some veg) and potatoes that are in some sweet and sour sauce..  I actually love these potatoes!  The place is always busy when I come for dinner so it's a good idea to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Decor is modern looking, with an Asian feel to it. There is a lot of lighting so the place feels very open. There are tables along with booths in the seating area. The place is fairly large and can seat a large number of people. 

I enjoyed the miso soup, salad, and potatoes at the beginning of the meal.

This restaurant serves a la carte sushi, as well as Korean food. We came here for dinner. We ordered an assorted platter of sushi, sashimi, and rolls to share for 3 people. This was more than enough for 4 people. The sashimi was fresh and cut nicely. I enjoyed the unagi here. The presentation was pretty, the chefs even included fresh flowers! The platter came with several different cuts of salmon, tuna, squid, and rolls.  The sushi rice was cooked perfectly and the flavour of it was nice. I loved how the rice for the sushi wasn't overly large in proportion to the fish.

The server was friendly and the food came quickly. We got here just before the dinner rush at 7pm. After this 7pm the place becomes quite busy.

The sushi and sashimi was decently priced. I enjoyed my meal and experience here. I'd be back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and ordered a  roll set with a spicy salmon roll and another roll (which I can't quite remember) for $10.00
It came with a miso soup, and they brought some interesting complimentary appetizers (salmon dipped in a miso sauce and agedashi tofu).

The quality is first-rate and presentation was beautiful.  The reason for only 3 stars is I was still hungry afterwards - it was as though I hadn't eaten anything!

Price points at lunch can be critical, especially with lots of competition nearby, and although the quality was exceptional, I probably would have had to order at least double in order to be full.

I may/may not come back here - I honestly prefer Piggy next door (which is a Korean restaurant)."}
{"text":"Like a lot of people, I came to try some very interesting fresh seafood. Experience wise, Gonoe was cool. The moving octopus was definitely social media photo worthy.

We ordered Flounder Sashimi + Seafood Combo Set $139.95
- Flounder Sashimi (M) + Seafood Sashimi Combo (1. abalone; 2. sea squirt; 3. sea cucumber; 4. Urechis unicinctus, 5. octopus) + assorted tempura + deep fried fish + spicy fish soup

My friends and I all felt that there were just too much sashimi. unlike the one we usually have in a sushi bar: salmon, toro, tuna etc. when i say sashimi, i meant those tasteless chewy raw sea animals. besides that and the spicy fish soup, the rest were deep fried which just does not go very well with all the cold chewy raw seafood we just finished and were also lack of flavours. when we finally eat our way to the last dish spicy fish soup, we had so much expectations on it. we wish it could be warm and hearty with flavours. but soup was so bland!! 

We waited in the line for so long and it was just disappointed. 
but again social media photo worthy! a pretty cool way to show off."}
{"text":"I really like this sushi spot! Lots of variety and they have different kinds of food options on their menu whether you are craving Sasha, Korean pork bone soup, or stir fry they have it all. I came here on a late Monday evening around 10pm after a movie night with my boyfriend and to our surprise this place is actually opened until 11:30 and not 9:30pm (score!). 

Giving taste and portion 5/5 
Atmosphere 4/5 

Taste and portion 5/5 - We ordered the sushi combo (highly recommend) for $39 and a rainbow roll. The combo was such a great deal (see my photo) should have opted for the larger one instead of adding a rainbow roll. I'm in love with raw scallop sashimi and salmon and this place has it done right! Quite generous on the sashimi slices and was very very full. I also love all the side dishes they give you typically at a Korean restaurant AND we get soul and salad also. 

Atmosphere 4/5  - parking is a bit of a hassle here since there is no parking right in front of the building. You have to park around the corner inside the plaza complex and walk around to the restaurant which was no biggie for us but maybe not ideal for those who are not able to access places as easily. The decor is okay here except for the creepy red dim light in the middle of the restaurant on the ceiling. They could do some sprucing up on the furniture as the seats in the booths were starting to show tear."}
{"text":"I always order take out sushi tray.  They offer 10% off if you pay cash.  I live very close to the restaurant so is very convenient for me to pick up on the way home after work."}
{"text":"i tried their off-menu live octopus, it was a fun experience. their kalbi is amazing, it's quite different that other places, there didn't cut them in slices, it was a couple of big bones and the meat comes right off, very flavorful, it's a must try."}
{"text":"It's safe to say that the first time I went to a Gal's Sushi restaurant, it was 10 years ago. Back then, they had a location near Bayview on Highway 7 (near the YogaTree plaza) and that was probably before this location even opened. Both locations used to be owned by a Korean family I think and I LOVED this place. I used to come religiously every week. Their sushi and Korean dishes were so affordable and so good. Even when I didn't come to eat, I'd come get takeout. 

I think in the past year or so, they've sold it to new owners. Although the menu hasn't changed, I think the prices went up a bit and the quality/authenticity has gone down quite a lot. I miss the days when it was really really good."}
{"text":"Lineups are out the door so make sure to book a reservation if you're considering coming here! 
We ordered a medium sushi/sashimi boat and an order of live octopus. 
Starting with the octopus, it was definitely an interesting experience. It looked a lot slimier than it tasted and it was extremely tough and chewy. I would highly recommend using either the provided dipping sauce or soy sauce because it's rather bland on its own. Its texture resembles an eraser and my jaw was worn out after only two pieces. You would definitely need to share this dish with a few others because it becomes progressively less enjoyable with every piece. I see the appeal of trying it once (to feel the octopus legs suck onto your tongue/mouth), but I would not order it again, especially since it's a pricey delicacy. 
As for the boat, there was a wide assortment of fresh sashimi and sushi, but I found that the maki pieces could use improvement. They were sizable pieces but easily fell apart when picked up."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite restaurant for sushi.  The fish is always very fresh and the sushi is pretty authentic.  I've only had better sushi in Japan.

Their bento boxes have generous portions for the price.  It's got quite a bit of sushi/sashimi as part of it, which is what I love about it but it may not be for everyone.

What's also a nice touch is offering two free starters.  They will give you a small serving of sweet and sour potatoes and noodles.

Gal's has a great selection on their menu.  I've never ventured into the Korean part of it but I'm told it's fantastic.  Everything I have tried (a lot of the appetizers and Japanese portion of the menu) has been good.

The service is good.  It can be a little slow during prime times but there's an electronic bell that you can push to call the server.

Overall, this is my favourite Japanese restaurant.  Great food for a decent price."}
{"text":"Good food at a good value. 
For a $9.99 lunch combo, I always finish feeling full and satisfied with my meal. The sashimi may not be the freshest but the portion sizes are just enough and they offer a variety of combo choices. 
The complimentary salad is nice but be warned that the miso soup leaves you super thirsty afterwards. The japchae glass noodles was also a bit too oily/wet today, not something that I usually experience when I come here. 
I would probably rate the food a 3.5 but I'll round it up because service was great. Despite being busy, the waitress was polite and offered to fill our tea even though the kettle stays at our table."}
{"text":"I have to take away my 4 stars that I gave them before. Food is not as good as before. I think they are down grading their restaurant. I will not go there anymore."}
{"text":"I came here specifically for the seafood combo, with the live octopus being the dish I wanted to try the most.  I must say, the octopus was SUPER FRESH! (Lol of course, it moves...)  Although some may say that it's bland, I actually like the taste.  There is also sesame oil and salt on the side to help complement the flavour.  Besides that, I also enjoyed the abalone and sea cucumber.  Do note that I haven't tried anything on their regular menu yet.  But judging just the seafood combo, it is worth a try."}
{"text":"I ordered the sushi combo and everything on it was incredibly fresh and delicious. Plus, they were having some kind of sea urchin promotion or something, and that was on the plate! I'd only had it once before, and I found it fish tasting and kind of unpleasant. This one was light, mildly (pleasantly) fishy and kind of made me want more. 

The prices are a bit higher compared to what you can get in the area, but the quality matches it easily. Service is quick and attentive and the seating is all pretty intimate."}
{"text":"The lunch special here is quite affordable and quick.  There is a small selection of lunch boxes which include salad, miso soup and the lunch box. The food is filling and delicious. I got the grilled salmon lunch box here and I quite enjoyed it. This place is close to my house, so I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came to this location for a late dinner. Arrived around 9:00 pm. The service wasn't very good. There were many tables, but we waited 10 minutes just to get a seat. Their call button didn't work, so waited 20 minutes for the bill. The food also wasn't very impressive. We ordered sashimi and the Beef flank spicy soup. Usually, the soup is boiling when it arrives, but this one was just warm. 

Pros: 
Sashimi was fresh

Cons:
Slow service
Broken call button
Wet table
Soup was warm, not hot"}
{"text":"Sushi was great, but the free tea, appetizers and dessert were amazing! I also love the full picture menu! Nearly every item has a photo! Great service, great crowd, I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you want Korean Food and Japanese food at a good price.

Like other Korean Restaurants, they complement your meal with the free apps (You have to ask for their Kim Chi, they dont normally give it for free unless you ask for it).

Their Lunch Specials are all well priced.  
For what you pay, the sushi is worth ordering.

I recommend:
LA Kal Bi
Soon Tofu
Rolls (Order A3... bang for your buck)
Sushi platters

The service is good, BUT, there is one gentleman who is literally a one man show!, he is a machine!  Watching him work was definitely a performance.  He is able to Host / Take multiple orders / help out with the bar&refreshments / Clear Tables / Greet / settle bills ect when it gets busy.  I think I also saw him helping the Sushi Chefs too!  Great Friendly professional service."}
{"text":"Came here specifically for the live octopus!
The octopus was $28 and was a fun experience. Slimy texture and chewy

We ordered the medium sushi/sashimi boat, it came with a good variety of sushi and thick slices of sashimi
Also ordered the orangeville roll, which was very big! The orangeville roll was everyone's favourite and I would recommend it to others

Served with miso soup, salad, kimchi, japchae, pickled radish and some veggies as side dishes 
Service was quick when you press the button.
Overall it was a good experience and the food was good, but the food was not amazingggggg"}
{"text":"I'm so sad at the changes that gals sushi has implemented recently. What I loved most here was there ability to accommodate changes for their roll box (eg. change rice to potatoes) but now there is an extra cost to any change. I feel like this was their differentiating factor for me as my favourite go to sushi joint, but now this has bumped up $$/meal for me if I dont want to waste food. The quality of food has not changed, but I won't be frequenting gals as much anymore."}
{"text":"Visit this place frequently and love it...it's a little gem in the plaza. Try their kimchi, outta this world. They owner and staff are Korean but the sushi is unbelievable and service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoy eating here. They normally give huge portions and the price for all that food is pretty worth it to me. I love love love sushi. I'll try every sushi place there is out there, but this place always tugs my heart strings a little bit! This is located at a very convenient place and east parking as well. 

I love getting the bento box since you get to choose which sushi side/main you want. Not too shabby! 

I would recommend this place for those who love a quick easy food sushi dinner or lunch! 

Their lunch menu is pretty good too, decent pricing. And if you are going to order take out - call ahead! It's much faster."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Japanese restaurants!

Great place to go in small groups and even in big groups. Although the wait for a table can be long sometimes (I'm talking about 10-20 minutes), it is pretty reasonable considering how packed it gets on Friday nights and on weekends. Nevertheless, the wait is always worth it! Sushi is fresh with a large selection of other Japanese/Korean dishes, and the service is even better with their very courteous staff. Most tables have a little button on the side that is very useful instead of having to wave down a server. From what I hear, this restaurant is locally owned by Koreans and it is the perfect place to hit up when you are in the Markham area!

Price is amazing especially for the quality and quantity of their bento boxes which I always get."}
{"text":"Visited this place over 5 years ago, it was nothing special. Recently my friend got me lunch from there I was blown away. Tempura was not soggy at all when I got it and sashimi was so fresh that it melted in my mouth. The special rolls they included in the lunch bento was good and unique. I ended up ordering lunch from them 3 days in a week.. I was just addicted lol"}
{"text":"Gonoe is located in a plaza among many other Asian restaurants and marketplace. Owned and Operated by Korean, Gonoe serves Japanese cuisine along with several Korean dishes.

As this restaurant is so popular, it is always packed. We went on a weekend and could not make a reservation and waited around 45 minutes for a table for 5.  

Tempura Appetizer
The assorted tempura appetizer includes your typical shrimps and vegetables like cucumber, sweet potato. It is deep fried to perfection with a very well done crispy breaded coating. The only complain would be that the shrimp was not fresh. 

Side Dishes
Like your typical Korean restaurant, Gonoe serves a few side dishes. We got kimchi, japchae (glass noodles), broccoli and pickled radish. Something to clear the palette between different dishes. We also each got a salad as a starter.  

Grilled Black Cod
One of our favorite hot dishes of the night. Accompanied by a lot of vegetables and a bowl of rice. The black cod was flavored perfectly with a very smooth and soft texture by the well preserved oil from the fish itself. The natural oil of the fish makes it very moist.

Flounder Sashimi (Small)
Served beautifully on a bed of shaved radish with an assorted variety of leafy vegetables, the flounder sashimi is one of the most popular dishes at Gonoe. There are a few different ways to eat the flounder sashimi, you can either eat it dipped in your typical soy sauce and wasabi or wrapped in lettuce with miso paste, garlic slices and jalapeno. We found the flounder sashimi to be a little chewy because of its tendons so it was rather difficult to eat as a wrap. Although we only ordered a small platter, it was quite a large portion and we got bored of eating it after a while. So it's best if you order it with more people. It was nonetheless very fresh and tender but not our favorite dish and probably won't order it again. 

Live Octopus Sashimi
The highlight of our night of course was the octopus sashimi. This has got to be the freshest yet most challenging way to eat an octopus - while it's \"alive\" and moving. With this dish, we are mainly eating the tentacles, it is served diced up on a small plate with dipping sauce that contains sea salt and sesame oil. While the octopus itself doesn't have much taste to it, the dipping sauce gave it a light salty flavor that brought out the sweetness of the fresh octopus. It also has a very unique chewy texture that is softer than its cooked version. It might seem slimy and disgusting to some people but it doesn't actually feel that way once it's inside your mouth. Do be careful though to chew thoroughly or the tentacles might get stuck in your throat with their suction cups!  

Assorted Sushi and Sashimi Boat (Medium)
Filled with freshness from the sea, this boat consists of a good mix of sashimi, sushi and rolls including Salmon, Tuna, Snapper, Surf Clam, Octopus, Hiring, BC Tuna and Hamachi, Eel, Shrimp, California Roll, Dynamite Roll . The sashimi is very fresh to taste and have beautiful colors and evenly distributed fat.   

We had quite a lot of fun eating at Gonoe. Although the wait was a bit long, we enjoyed the food very much, which made the wait worthwhile. We highly recommend you to go try out this restaurant if you happen to be in Toronto! It's one of the few places that serve quality live octopus and fresh sashimi. We hope you enjoy your time at Gonoe as much as we did!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and their lunch specials are a steal! I ordered the Sashimi, Roll  and Sushi Box which came with miso soup and salad, all for just 8.99! Good food at a good price, plus quick service, no complaints here!

- from a thoroughly satisfied customer"}
{"text":"What we got: eel on rice, sashimi bento

Taste: really good

Portion: decent

Price: expensive but they were generous so it's alright (they gave thick cuts of sashimi)

Time: took a long time to get our food

Overall: yes I would come back"}
{"text":"Just been here for lunch. We ordered a sashimi lunch box, chicken cutlet soup udon, soon tofu and an avocado roll. Bento box was ok, rice a bit hard. The soup udon was ok but would have preferred the cutlet on the side and not getting soggy in the soup. The avocado roll was ok. The best dish was the soon tofu, surprisingly. It was beef and seafood. Had some beef, 2 shrimp, 1 mussel, diced squid and baby scallops. Broth was tasty and spicy. Great on a cold day like today.  Tofu could have been silkier.
Service was ok, not a smile until we had paid the bill and she saw a $5 tip. 
Parking here is really bad because of all the medical offices they have here, that use the same car park.  I would say it's ok for a bite to eat, if you're in the area but not so great that I'd come back especially to eat."}
{"text":"I usually head to AYCE restaurants and fill my stomach up till it hurts. Every once in a blue moon I would check into an authentic sushi restaurant instead.

I ordered the Sashimi & Sushi dinner special (picture below). Comes with few appetizers and green ice cream. I have to say they have high quality Sashimis here. Tastes as fresh as it looks (picture below). Sushi and makis were alright.

Now to the restaurant: Nice decor, clean place, comfy booths, and wonderful service.

Overall great place for Sashimi lovers. Sashimi here is a must try!"}
{"text":"This is our favourite take out sushi restaurant- always a good value for your $ /  try to arrive 15 mins early to beat the dinner rush line ups"}
{"text":"The quality of Gal Sushi has generally decreased since it first arrived on the scene. Back in 2009, its sashimi and beef sashimi was a weekly staple for me due to its close proximity.

Fast-forward to 2014, I can understand that you use funny-smelling sashimi for lunch specials, (after-all, we are cheapskates for choosing these special, right?)I can accept the toughness of beef sashimi (it's the cow's fault), yet how do you explain that when a customer order a serving of premium sashimi ($12.99), that they are served with tough, un-chewable, pieces of fish filled with white and BLACK VEINS?

The toro sashimi was absolutely inedible, so anyone who wishes to order it, think twice per the picture below, I'm getting stomachaches just thinking about it. There is only one place around Richmond Hill/Markham that serves authentic toro, and that is the place on Leslie just north of Highway 7.

If you don't have toro or for that matter, ANY type of fish that is up to par, JUST DONT'T SERVE IT. We do not wish to eat veins, or for that matter, any funny-smelling fish. Now, perhaps the price of sashimi has really gone up, and thus is why the pieces in your combos has consistently gotten smaller?

For anyone interested, I can upload comparison pics from 2009-2014, it's really quite interesting.

The reasons why I have not given this place 0 stars, which I desperately wishes to do? 1) Due to nostalgia, and 2) there really isn't an option to do so.
Come on, GalSushi, you can do better."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I remember coming here as a kid when the City of Markham was just starting to thrive. Now i live less than a kilometer away from the place. A personal favorite would be the Salmon Bulgogi bento box at lunch time. Prices went up a few bucks but hey, it's still reasonable. Place is clean, service is excellent, just generally a very well ran restaurant! Would definitely recommend trying :)"}
{"text":"Decent amount of food for the price and everything is fairly good. The sashimi here is good & the scallop appetizer was great! Service can be very slow when it's busy which is most evenings. I've been multiple times and would keep going as long as I get a reservation."}
{"text":"We ordered the Chicken Katsu Udon and Sushi Sashimi Bento Box.  The soup for the udon wasn't hot enough and the Katsu wasn't crispy because it was placed in the soup (probably sitting there for too long).  The Sushi and Sashimi in the bento box was pretty much average.  Service was okay and they do get busy closer to lunch, although we don't know why because we weren't impressed.  Perhaps it takes more to impress us now.  The bill came to about $31 including tax and tip.  2.5 stars out of 5."}
{"text":"We have been back a few times here, mainly for the food. The service itself is just soso.

You are greeted with a few tanks of seafood, some flounders, octopus, and some random sea creatures I cannot name.

We stumbled on this gem by accident. Usually came during lunch hour, and have the bento or sashimi rice. The seafood is always fresh and the presentation thoughtful. I especially love the 5 color natto vegetable salad that you eat wrapped with seaweed. I could eat this everyday. They never gave enough seaweed so you have to order more, which cost like a buck for 9 pieces or something. For something like this you'd think they'd just refill for free but no.

Then one time we came for dinner and decided to branch out and order the more exotic Korean style sashimi platter at the back of the menu. The quantity is amazing! The flounder sashimi was quite interesting. The texture is crisper compared to the usual tuna or salmon. 

The rest of the sashimi are from things like sea urchin and other unknown creatures, but when the octopus sashimi came it was quite a shock. We had not expect the degree of freshness this would be. The chopped up tentacles were moving vigorously on the plate, so much so that some of them escaped from the plate. When you tried to remove them, the suckers on the tentacles kept them stuck on the plate. It was an interesting experience. I did not eat them, as I was still shocked by the liveliness of the severed limbs. When I spoke to my Korean relatives about this, they laughed and said that was the way it is supposed to be.

The combo also came with a big kimchi soup at the end. We were too full from all the sashimi to enjoy it.

All in all, I love the food here, will come back but just know don't expect too much on the service aspect"}
{"text":"Usually I would have written a review of flying colours for Gals considering it is a favourite for me and my girlfriend, but tonight We went out for a late night bite and got a couple roles. From when we had sat down to the end our server was never close by to take drink orders or to check on the meal. After we were done we waited about 25 minuets before she even brought us the bill, by the time she had brought the card reader, I was not to impressed with the service so I decided not to tip. When she had printed the receipt,she stopped us on our way out and told us \"the original cost did not include a tip; how will you pay cash or charge.?\" After  those very rude words I just just put down about 2 dollars of pocket change and left.
This was my absolute favourite Sushi restaurant but now.. I think it's safe to say we'll be taking take out."}
{"text":"Pretty run of the mill sushi and Korean food. 

A friend of mine was craving sushi, so I suggested Gals because we could still make the lunch special. 

Their lunch bento boxes range from $9.99 to $12.99 and they also offer Korean lunch specials. 

I got the bulgogi and sushi bento box for $12.99. You start with salad and miso soup before the mains come. The bulgogi was pretty good, but the sushi wasn't mind blowing. Pretty standard California and crab rolls, with shrimp, tuna, and salmon sushi. There was a torched white fish that was pretty interesting. 

If you don't catch their lunch special, the food is actually pretty expensive. Especially the Korean dishes. A gamjatang can run you $15.99 if I remember correctly, which is double the price of most Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"L4 lunch combo was highly recommended from fellow yelpers. It's the sashimi and sushi bento box, $12 with taxes in. Good price for what I think is a lot of food and good quality food. 

I substituted my roll for a spicy salmon roll and compared to most sushi places this goes near the top. I like the sushi and topping ratio! 

The sashimi was great! They sear the butter fish and it's just.... Heaven. 

Along with the bento box you get some Korean sides and rice. 

Service is quick and friendly. Would definitely go back again for lunch!"}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant. Tried out live octopus and flounder fish. I expected it would taste fishy, turned out pretty good with the sauces you can use to dip in. My first time ever eating live moving octopus (many attempts I had failed to lift the octopus off the plate) , probably i  wont be eating/wrestling with the octopus for a long while. The flounder combo cames with the flounder sashimi, leafy wraps, sashimi spicy salad, and spicy tofu soup."}
{"text":"Gonoe is always a safe option for me when I want some good and decently-priced sushi. The quality of their food is on point every time I come here. My friend ordered the kame bento, which came with a side seaweed salad. I got a spicy salmon roll and california roll. The spicy mayo they use is actually spicy, unlike the ones at many other Japanese restaurants I've been to. 

We both got a salad and miso soup to start, and they gave us 4 Korean side dishes (why we got these when we both ordered Japanese food beats me, but not going to complain about getting more food!)

Another reason I like coming here is for the green tea ice cream they give you as dessert at the end of your meal! Mmmm :)

Service was excellent. We didn't wait too long for our food, and the waitress would consistently come and check up on us and refill our tea."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends after church. We had a group of 20 and it was \"interesting\" how they manage to fit all of us. But they did. Food was alright and pretty much the same 2 years ago when I last visited this place. The staff are busy running around to keep all the patrons happy."}
{"text":"I have been to Gal's many times because I accompany others who wish to come here. It is just A-OK in my opinion. Inconsistent experiences almost every time.

Service can be hit or miss... tonight's dinner was somewhat inattentive even when it was almost empty around 9:30PM (they close at 11PM daily). Maybe it was a slow Friday? Their prices are more expensive than comparable places and the lunch specials are also higher than comparable places, so maybe people are finding better value for taste elsewhere as they used to be always packed.

They serve both Japanese sushi and Korean dishes, but mostly the former. Their sushi is smaller than other a-la-carte sushi restaurants. Their Korean dishes are a lot more expensive than restaurants that only serve Korean dishes (e.g. gamjatang $12.99 here vs most other places $6.99-8.99). I have tried both the soon tofu and gamjatang here, they are tasty. They were also nice about refilling the kimchi banchan (they only gave us kimchi and potato banchans, no japchae this time, also gave each person a miso soup and salad).

One unique thing they do is pre-add a tiny amount of wasabi between your sushi so all you do is just dip into the soy sauce. May be good/bad depending on your preference.

Agree with another review that since this is an a-la-carte restaurant, I can't help but compare the price/quality to an AYCE sushi buffet, and I feel like you get don't get that much more value for the higher prices/smaller quantity here. Still I would come back due to location and the fact that they are just A-OK."}
{"text":"I have been to Gal sushi for many years, it has been a decent place for sushi, however over the years I say the quality of food and service have slowly gone downhill.  

Having recently visited this place I've noticed all the waiter/waitress have been changed, that would explain a bit how the service has been just par as compare to before it was always friendly and quickly refills your tea and small dishes.

The price for food is average, the sushi is fresh and few are above average quality, but lacks the ones that use to give me the impression of \"wow this melts in my mouth\" as Gal would before. 

Overall I would still come once in a while, as long as quality doesn't drop further more, as that would not justify the price we are paying."}
{"text":"5 stars for fast, friendly and efficient service!! It was my first time tonight and although the food wasn't extraordinarily different than everywhere else it was still good. Will definitely recommend and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Quick disclaimer, my review is purely based on the seafood special platter as well as the flounder sashimi. I've come back to this restaurant numerous time for the same dishes. Not sure how their other dishes are but they do their specialty Korean style seafood stuff VERY well."}
{"text":"Ordered chirashi again. Yes, two days in a row and is 14.99.  The selection they put into your bowl is fairly good as they put salmon, tuna, red tuna, snapper, inari, eel, tamago, shrimp and crab meat.  The rice had a nice flavour to it.  So why only 3 stars, I feel like their black cod and eel are always too overcooked and salty.  

However, its not a bad place for sushi in the area."}
{"text":"I was flitting between 4 and 5 stars for a very long time. On one hand, this place has been around for awhile and I've never had a huge urge to write about it. On the other hand, I just realized that in the last week, I've been 3 times. Welp. 

Gal's is becoming, if not already, an establishment in Markham. It's a place for quality Japanese and Korean food rolled into a fast-paced, efficient, friendly package. In the many, many times I've come since its opening, I've never had an issue with either the food or service. I have no doubt anything you order will be delicious but here are some of my time-tested favourites.

Any of the \"Best Choice\" trays: Seriously, it says \"best choice\" in its name. And they mean it. This is the premium plate with uni, hamachi, o-toro, salmon belly, etc. Pricey, but not as pricey as you'd think for the kinda stuff you're getting. 

Chirashi: Gal's has the best Chirashi of any place I've ordered it from. It's simple, really. Good selection of satisfying, meaty pieces of fresh sashimi, all on top a bed of SEASONED rice. The seasoning really kicks this up a notch for me.   

Gamjatang: It's a sweater for your soul. After the first bite, you think that the menu misled you by saying this isn't a spicy dish. It has quite a kick. But by the third bite, the fire becomes cozy liquid warmth that fills your mouth with flavour and tender pork. There's no better dish for the winter and Gal's version is so satisfying, it's the reason I went back more than once a week. 

On top of these, I can say their bento boxes are A-OK, especially for lunch, and their rolls are well crafted. This place is always bustling at dinner time but the little bell at your table helps to grab the server's attention. What can I say? I'll probably be back next week. Maybe the one after that too. 

(19/100) - 2018"}
{"text":"If you want cheap sushi, the lunch menu at Gal's is a good place to start.  Their lunch bento box combos come with a salad, miso soup, sweet potatoes and clear glass noodles.  You are able to choose from multiple different choices of sushi, sashimi, tempura, beef, chicken or grilled salmon.  The bento boxes range from $10-14.

The sushi is subpar, but it's a good place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"for once a lunch combo that can fill me up. 
the staff is very friendly and nice and always checking up even tho the restaurant is pretty busy. 
the food is good, not the best cuts of the fish, but maybe that's why they put it in the lunch combo. Will restaurant for dinner and lunch and try more options."}
{"text":"If you ask a guy from markham where he would take a girl out for sushi, I would say 80% chance they'll take them to gals. 

Its clean and spacious. The quality of the sashimi is pretty good for the price you're paying. It's not cheap but more moderate priced. Service is good and food comes out in 10-15 minutes so you know they got your back and wont leave you hangry.

The parking is quite limited in the plaza but there's plenty of underground parking."}
{"text":"I love coming here!! I usually order the large sushi/sashimi platter to share. It is a great place for catching up with my friends. The service is pretty fast and I can't say that the sashimi tastes super super fresh or AMAZING --- its good enough to make me think of this place for satisfy my regular sushi craving without a fail!

I love getting black dragon rolls! yummy. its always delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi, I love the decor of the place and the fact that they have a button system to call for waiters. I find that system to be far more calming, they the traditional stare at the waiter and wave like a mad man.

The sushi quality is great and the service has always been good over the years"}
{"text":"Although Gal's Sushi opened up for a long time, this is the first time I've been here! 

I really wanted Korean food, but somewhere a little closer to myself, so my friends suggested to come here - even though their specialty is Japanese. It was fairly filled up on a weekday night over the second week of holidays. Something I really enjoyed was their privacy that they value in all of their seats - each person had a booth - not a wide open area, though in thick winter jackets and bags and presents, it was a little challenging for 4 girls to share a booth area.

I ordered the Gam Ja Tang - $11.99. Gam Ja Tang is Korean for Pork Bone Soup. They served us sweet potatoes and glass noodles (classic favourites) for the banchan. All of our meals came out at once, at a decent speed. This also came with a bowl of rice. The pork bone soup had maybe 5 pieces of rice cake or so, though I didn't think of it as anything SUPER special. The soup was moderately spicy, and the pork bones had a little bit of meat.

I think I would come back to try their Bento Boxes because I heard that those were their specialty."}
{"text":"So far this is my favourite sushi place. I will say that I am not by any means an Elite sushi eater. I usually stick with Salmon, Tuna, Butterfish and Shrimp. But this place has the best Spicy Tuna and Spicy Salmon rolls that I have tried yet. They also have a Lobster Tempura roll (kinda like a dynamite roll but with lobster instead) and that is also very good."}
{"text":"Normally I'm a person who eats a lot, but I would recommend not order too much.  The prices for each item on the menu is quite reasonable and the sushi is delectable.  

The waiter services not as good as it could be, but since the food is delicious, I didn't really mind.  I would recommend ordering bulgogi or sushi, sashimi, and roll combos but overall everything there is very good!"}
{"text":"Had the spicy scallop roll ($6.99) and spicy tuna roll ($5.99). The rolls were fresh and inside had some spicy sauce with onions, fish eggs, and crunchy bits. And little rice is always a win! They're usually pretty busy during lunch hour, but service and food came fast. Their lunch special bento boxes are a good price around the $10-12 range. Been coming here for awhile and definitely a popular Markham sushi joint."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here.. The service seemed nice but I was not impressed by the sushi quality. Wasnt as fresh I would have expected as the other reviews rave how fresh the sushi here is. But the price isnt bad. Ordered a sushi, sashimi and roll tray with 48 pieces for $37."}
{"text":"It's a really popular sushi place. Almost every time we need to wait for 10-15 minutes to get the spot. 

The sashimi is always fresh and the sushi is really tasty. The sashimi shrimps are always taste a bit of natural sweetness after you eat, that means the shrimp is really fresh. The raw scallops are really creamy as well.

We always feel so satisfied after eating here. Really good place for sashimi and sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"I came about a week ago with my family. I had high expectations because of my prior visit. However, I was sorely disappointed. I'm assuming that with the name change, the owners have changed as well. 

We ordered the hamachi kama, a small sashimi tray, their tempura dinner, and their Gonoe roll. None of it was good on value. The sashimi tray had less variety than the sashimi dinner I ordered last time. The salmon had connective tissue in it. It was quite underwhelming. Their tempura dinner, while tasty, is considerably smaller than I recall it being, so it's not a good deal anymore. Their Gonoe roll, while looking impressive, is quite expensive and doesn't stand out as being particularly tasty. Our first order of hamachi kama was slightly raw on the inside, so we let the waitress know and she had them redo it for us. The first time, the fish didn't come piping hot. The second time, it did. That tells me they struggle with consistency. The portion was alright for price, but not great.

While service was alright, it also confused me. I've never had servers pass me food over table partitions before. I don't know if that's because she just wanted to take a shortcut to serve other tables, or whether she thought there wasn't enough space between our table and the empty one next to us to bring our food right to our table. Awks."}
{"text":"I've definitely had much better sushi.  I think that they can use some improvement on the size of their sashimi slices as well as their nigiri.  I've never seen such tiny balls of rice under a tiny thinly sliced piece of fish.

It's fresh - I'll give it that...but 3 stars and a repeat customer because it's conveniently located across the street from where my brother lives so we order from there all the time."}
{"text":"Lunch is DEFINITELY A big thumbs up here! Bento boxes from 8.99!  But it's super crowded!

For dinner we ordered takoyaki, kalbi ribs appetizer and a 35 or 45 piece sushi, rolls, sashimi set. The service was good and it was quite busy. the takoyaki was decent there wasn't mist bonito flakes and mayo and they lacked the seaweed powder.. We personally preferred the takoyaki at the T&T food court at middlefield and steeles. The kalbi ribs were cook very well! Soft tender and flavorful! The sushi set was fresh and really good plus the shrimp tempura roll and the dragon roll * i believe * has a lot of avocado! My only downside is the amount of wasabi they place in the sushi. It might've been busy so they put a heavier hand but what if someone can't take wasabi or take that amount. But luckily we had no major problems but a few piece I had to take a big gulp of water to get it down. 

Other then that it's DEFINITELY worth a go if you don't want ayce and fresh selections!"}
{"text":"If you are staying around the Toronto area and are in need of some authentic Asian cuisine this is a must try. The sushi tastes like it was straight out of the ocean and the chefs know how to give a presentation. The main course started with a miso soup and I know that most miso soups taste similar but this one will stick with you for the rest of your trip. Everyone was delighted with the service and food and we will be coming back when in the area."}
{"text":"Gonoe is an extremely solid sushi option that offers better than average sushi and some very unique items. 

I didn't get to try the specialities but we went with the hoe deop bap, a medium sushi/maki platter, and a special roll which is a fair valuation of a sushi place.

Salad was really interesting with a citrus based vinagrette instead of the usual. It was an extremely nice touch to include four banchan dishes, especially cucumber kimchi (which was amazing!). 

The hoe deop bap was an enormous portion with huge chunks of fish and a ton of veggies. Even with all the rice added, there wasn't enough rice (which is a first). The sauce was a good balance of vinegar to sweet. Overall, highly recommended! 

I really liked the orangeville special roll too, minimal rice, with tons of toppings and fillings. The sushi and maki platter was fairly standard but I liked that their maki rolls and nigiri sushi again, had minimal rice. The fish was fairly fresh and I liked their spicy salmon rolls, which was creatively split by bread crumbs and actual salmon rather than being combined into one mixture.

The service was good, there was a service button to call the waitresses over when needed. There was complimentary green tea ice cream to finish. The décor and mood was nice and the booths were very intimate. Just a faultless experience for sushi."}
{"text":"Great place to come for lunch. Service is quick, efficient and the food is good. 

I always end up getting the L1 lunch special and this time is no different. I mean, you get twenty pieces of sushi/sashimi/rolls for $9.99! And there's soup, salad, and some japchae in the bento box! Incredible value and you will leave pretty satisfied. My sister got the L3 box and it comes with 6 California rolls, 3 spicy tuna, 3 crab, and 4 deep fried rolls. It comes with the Korean glazed potatoes (gamja jorim) which are great! I've tried most of the lunch specials before and you can't go wrong with any. I really like their menu; there's tons of variety to choose from depending on what you feel like having. I wish there was some crazy bento box with everything but I just end up 'sharing/stealing' some with friends/family. So the food! Simply put, the sushi is good. It's not phenomenal by any means but for the price you pay, it's decent. The special rolls are pretty good here and I recommend them. They are Korean owned and I have to try their Korean food!

There's tons of tables and we didn't have any problems getting a table at lunch. You can tell this place is popular for lunch with the amount of people here that work nearby! The place is inviting and service is great. There is the buzzer where you press which tells the waiters your table needs service and it works well! There's very few things to not like about this place and you will have a great experience here for lunch!"}
{"text":"The specialty of this restaurant is Korean flounder and other Korean seafood specialties although they do have basic Japanese sushi and other Japanese dishes.
I had tried the small Korean flounder combo with four friends for $77.95. It comes with tempura, flounder and soup. I was told that the small flounder serves 2 people however, I think the meal can serve 4 people due to the, side dishes, soup and additional rice they gave. We also ordered the sushi lunch set A (8 sushi + 6 rolls) for $10.95.
In the end we were all pretty full.
We ate the sashimi in Korean BBQ style putting it on lettuce and adding sauces, garlic and peppers and putting it all in your mouth. The fish tasted light and fresh and the sauces made it tastier. I don't know if the tastes justifies the price but the fish was imported in from Korea so that's why.
The sushi had more fish than rice and the rolls were tasty with a hint of sweetness. 
The sushi and roll selection contains the most standard names compared to other sushi places but there is definitely good value.
I really like the spicy sauce that came with the flounder. It wasn't really spicy and it was kind of sweet. 
Now that I have tried the Korean flounder I don't know if i may get I again due to the price but who knows."}
{"text":"I went there to try the living octopus sashimi. we went there especially for this dish because it will still be moving as you place it in your mouth. we had ordered this place some lunch specials. Overall lunch specials were around 12 dollars after tax without tips. which was the cheapest ones, the bento boxes were around 17 dollars after taxes or so. The other dishes we tried were chriashi, spicy sashimi bowl, beef teriyaki box, and shrimp teriyaki. Overall the food was average, it did not seem to justify the price. i expected the food to be much better, given the price. 

The Service for a restaurant is average, however i think the servers will have communication problems as they do not speak english for the most parts. 

Overall i believe if you are a foodie and wanted to try the live sashimi, then it is worth coming, however if you just want a decent japanese meal, this place will be a bit pricier than necessary for a decent one around the area."}
{"text":"I've been here a hand full of times and it's never disappointing. It's also always busy which is a very good sign! The sushi/sashimi always tastes fresh and the portions are a good size.

I have to mention that the uni sushi is only $5.99 for 2 pieces! That's a steal!!!"}
{"text":"From mississauga to have traditional korean style sashimi call hwaluh.
Food came out fast service was much better than previous. Server was very nice though... However food is just terrible.  It is raw fish!!! Freshness is everything. i hope i dont get sick today...
 meh... not worth the time."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great prices. I go here every time I come to town. Servers could be a little more friendly."}
{"text":"Gal's isn't the best sushi I've ever had but it certainly isn't the worst either.  I would definitely go back but probably for lunch instead of dinner.  The sushi bar is quite small and the atmosphere is a little weird.  You sit down low unlike most bars that have you on bar stools.  The place is equipped with cameras in the ceiling like a bank.  I can't imagine why this is necessary behind the sushi bar.  It's not like the dudes working there are sampling the sushi and there certainly isn't any money being transferred there.....  It sort of reminded me of a McDonalds were the management has no respect for the employees.  Additionally it's a bit weird that the Asian dudes preparing the food have name-tags like \"Paul\" and \"Mark\"....  Overall the service was good and I would say the price was a bit below average for sushi."}
{"text":"Food was great. 
When we first came in the restaurant, everyone(chefs,waitresses)was eating lunch no one was greeting but eating their feast.
The whole time we were eating all the chefs and waitresses were sitting and chatting and laughing very loud I had to actually stand up to get attention from our waitress to get the bill..and by then she came to give us the bill and started to cleaning up other customers table behind us whom left an hour earlier...and after we pay she started to talking on the phone walking around give us changes back. 
Definitely never coming back or recommend to others even the food was good and pricey."}
{"text":"Gal's Sushi has a long history in Markham.  Did you know before they moved to the highway 7 and Warden area, they were at highway 7 and Leslie?  Anyways, the \"newest\" location is much larger than its previous but the quality of food they serve is still very consistent.  I would like to point out although it's call Gal's sushi, the owner is actually Korean and they also serve Korean food!

I go to Gal mostly during lunch for their bento boxes, and for 8.99 to 11.99 for a bento box that includes two Korean side dishes, rolls and your main choice (chicken, tempura, beef, more rolls, or sashimi), the price is very reasonable.  The portion is good for one person and their sushi and rolls are well made.  If you are not into raw food, they also have set lunch menu for Korean food with the traditional hot stone rice, Korean rice cakes just to name a few.

If you decide to come here for dinner, it will be a little more expensive, but if you have a group of 5 to 6 people, I will highly recommend ordering a tray of sushi or sashimi or a combination of both to share.  Their sushi and sashimi are very fresh and if you order the middle tier sushi tray, it already comes with Uni! Also known as sea urchin which is considered as a higher tier sushi in Japan.  What I am really impressed with this place is how they make their sushi.  The amount of rice they use for sushi is exactly how sushi are made in Japan!  The fish is able to wrap around the rice not the other way around where you see very often in cheaper restaurants that serve sushi!

Their services are great also, if you do not eat a certain fish, you just need to let them know and they will be more than happy to substitute the fish you don't eat with something else within the same tier with no additional cost! 

If you have a sudden craving for sushi or sashimi, do not want to travel far and stay in Markham and do not want to pay too much, then I would recommend giving Gal a try.  You try this place once, you will always be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant at time between lunch and dinner, so there was may be 3 other tables with couples, not busy at all (lunch time is very busy though). Ordered a special sushi roll and udon soup, both pretty good. Very little wait time for the food - and even when it's busy, the wait is not too bad. 
The items we ordered did not seem to have included miso soup and salad, but we got those, as well as 2 appetizers (potatoes in sauce and glass noodles), which was nice. Miso soup was regular as always, but salad was cold and probably pre-made earlier that day, was kind of stale. The extra food took this review to  solid 3 stars, I would do 2.5 stars otherwise (but I can't anyway). The reason is because it's nothing exceptional. I know this is a sushi to-go spot for some of my friends who work in this area, and that is worth noting as there are quite a few restaurants around this area, many of which serve sushi. 
Coming back to food we ordered, udon was good, the same as what I have had in other restaurants. The special sushi roll could be better for the price we paid. There are other sushi places that have more interesting options at comparable prices. 
The restaurant is not new, but kept very clean, bathroom was spotless. 
Going forward I would rather pay a little more and visit other joints with more elaborate menu options, but I know my friends will keep going here - trust in consistent good quality."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place. Turned out to be the opposite. If it wasn't for the okay food, I'd give this place a one-star rating. The people there are not so friendly or welcoming. More snooty-like.  They could look into investing in new menus (could fall apart anytime) as well as new bento boxes (colour chipping away).  When we were finished, they just handed us the bill without asking if we needed anything else. It's as if they were rushing us out of there. To top it off...No thank you or a good-bye. So...For a mediocre experience or meal...Please...Please do dine here."}
{"text":"Went here for Father's Day with my family for dinner. I like the bento box but it's kinda expensive $19.99 . The quality of the food is great . They have a Korean food menu . The receipt cost about $67 with 30 pieces and a bento box for 4 person. The service was great despite their busy hour for dinner rush . They have booths too if u call to request for a reservation . Their menu is a bit more expensive compare to the thornhill location"}
{"text":"4.5 stars out of 5. Maybe I'm giving it a higher rating than I should because I'm comparing it to the Gal's sushi on Hwy7. This location is wayyyyyyy better than the Markham one. In terms of freshness, I would say it's above average for the city. The tempura was nicely fried and portions were good. If I lived closer, I would come here a little more often."}
{"text":"I rather give this a 3.5 stars but I rounded it up. My favourite is the Gal's Sushi roll, it tasted great and was a good portion. Once in a while, I treat myself to some Uni as they prepare it very nicely here. In terms of \"freshness\" I would say it is at average for Markham standards. The little appetizers that they give before your meals are also very nice. Some of the items are very over priced (ex. bulgogi beef). The Bento prices they have for lunch time is quite fair and I would recommend that. I feel like the quality has a down a little bit since they opened up and makes the food feel a little over priced."}
{"text":"Standard sushi in Markham, always busy on weekends and evenings. They have great lunch and dinner combos that include sushi rolls, sashimi or hot foods like salmon or beef Bulgogi. Orders come with complementary side dishes which includes sweet deep fried potatoes, salad, miso soup and cold glass noodle."}
{"text":"This dish is called Lobster salad rolls on the menu. Please look at the pictures, it come with a lobster shell but there is CRAWFISH. I can't find one piece of lobster. Be careful when you make an order!!!! I have talked to the waitress to ask the restaurant change the name on the menu or use real lobster and do not cheat people again. The waitress apologised to us and cancelled the order. She is polite"}
{"text":"I went to Toronto for the weekend and I heard that this place was a good place to eat fresh sushi. Of course when a restaurant is hyped I try not to have any expectations. The place is really clean and it has a classy Asian feel to it. We went at around 11:00 and not a lot of customers were there. We ordered a lot of sushi and special lunch combos and the bill was not that bad for 4 people. The food came out pretty quick and we were impressed by the customer service. We even got a service or smoked salmon and free dessert. Since it is a Korean restaurant there was banchan as well aka side dishes. Overall I was really pleased with the food and music. I would definitely recommend others to try this place and would come again!

Tip: try something new like live octopus"}
{"text":"They have great lunch specials.  Especially their lunch box are great value for money. I think they should replace potato wedges and noodles to something more delightful in lunch box"}
{"text":"I did say I wasn't going to dine-in at Gal's Sushi in my last review but I needed a place to grab a quick bite for dinner and get takeout for an event so here I am... 

This visit is slightly better than the last, maybe because I sat at a booth near the check out so I didn't have to wave like a crazy lady to get the attention of a server. Even though the server acknowledged my need, he forgot what I needed as he went to attend other tables or customers. I think Gal's Sushi should consider hiring more staff.

Dining-in, I ordered A2 18 pieces assorted sushi rolls ($17.99) and V1 18 pieces assorted vegetarian roll ($14.99). I really enjoyed the vegetarian rolls especially with how fresh the avocados are--this is super awesome!! As for the assorted sushi rolls, I was very disappointed with the red dragon roll. Although it is beautifully topped with salmon and avocado, the filling in the sushi was largely lacking cucumber in it. I think there were probably one or at most two strands of cucumber in it. The cucumber gives provides a crunch texture but since the roll was lacking it, the sushi just felt mushy in my mouth. Also, the salad appetizer did not have enough dressing and just tasted slightly bitter. Nonetheless, the miso soup was warm and delightful.

As for my take-out, I don't have much to say about it apart from the presentation is very pretty since the sushi just tastes meeeeh...

Would I return?! Well... as Justin Bieber One sang \"never say never\" and I did say that I wouldn't and ended up coming back so... we'll see, haha!"}
{"text":"Been hearing about this place for some time, Gal is a popular sushi restaurant in Markham.
Located in a busy plaza filled with restaurants at Warden and Highway 7 Parking can be a challenge during peak dinner and dessert hours, especially on weekends. 
Thankfully I called ahead of time to make a reservation as by the time we arrived there were at least 5 parties waiting at the door.
Upon walking in the place is bustling! at every corner.  With a beautiful open concept kitchen where you can see where all the food is created, the decor, and food its no wonder this place is popular. 
For food, our party of 3 ordered their A7 combo which had a good melody of choices; assorted sushi, sashimi and rolls.  Presentation was beautiful and far importantly the food was fresh!
The overall service is good, but the food took quite long to arrive, but again, on a weekend it was expected.
Their prices are reasonable so i'll definitely have to be back to Gals for a second time. 

Pros:
-Food (quality)
-Ambiance
-Price

Cons:
-Parking..big headache
-Wait times
-Service"}
{"text":"Decent pricing and solid food. Come for the lunch deals - it is very filling. Much cheaper than coming for dinner!!"}
{"text":"One of our server, Amy was very helpful & nice. We loved our food; salmon teriyaki & salmon salad."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and they always impress me. Family member today wanted Japanese food and instead of going to those AYCE lunch Jap places which doesn't serve sashimi anyways. I suddenly came up with going to Gal's Sushi..Checked out the website online and the menu. I thought the prices were not updated because everything nowadays is getting ridiculously expensive even in food courts. The lunch specials are very well priced. 

Starts at 8.99 and up where I can get sashimi and be full. Wow..impressive. Yummy!

They had a full house today but service was still good considering the fact that they only had 4 servers. They tried to get to everyone as soon as they can; same with the food. 

Good service. Quality food. Excellent pricing!

Another good thing: they don't have those cheapy 10% service charge which gives no service. I would tip them more!

Yayyy to Gal's!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times.

I live/work in the area so it's my go to spot. 

Do'nt think of the 3 stars rating out of 5 as a bad thing, think of it as more of just OK.

Situated in the same plaza as the spectacular Paint Lounge and Green Grotto, along with some more other sub-par food offerings like Pho on 7 (bad pho joint) - Gal's Sushi neither impresses or disappoints.  They are very neutral in terms of food.

What I find them to be very good at is getting your orders out really quickly.  There's at least 4-5 sushi chefs working at one time so this explains it.

Their service is really lacking during lunch time versus their dinner time service. I do not know if it's the changing of the guard - maybe their dinner staff is on top of their game than the lunch time staff.

Case in point, I arrived today from the heavy rain and thunderstorm of today.  The restaurant maybe had 20 people dining away, there was 6 waitresses and 1 host who seem keen on cleaning up instead of paying attention at the door.  It took 5 minutes for them to notice me to offer me a table. Really guys?  6 people on the floor, 5 chefs, and a few more in the kitchen did not notice a customer? 

Food arrived quickly after I ordered their sushi box lunch ($8.99).  One of the banchan dishes in the box was suppose to be chap chae, but for some reason today I got 3 deep fried tofu squares.  Did they run out or something?  How do you run out of a staple dish that should be in abundance in a Japanese/Korean restaurant?  This wasn't the first time, at other times I was given a generous amount of potatoes!

Anyway, I was given my bill, I quickly placed a $20 bill into the folder - where 3-4 minutes went by and I actually had to bring it up to the attention of a waitress who was more focused on arranging utensils than to pay attention to customers.  

Were it me working with customers around, I'd pay close attention to what's going on around me, especially a lone customer who's obvoiusly on his lunch break and was given the bill not more than 30 seconds ago.  

Gal's Sushi - you really have to get your wait staff to be more attentive!"}
{"text":"I know other reviewers thought that the octopus didn't have much taste but I really really enjoyed it. It's a light, salty taste. Same with the flounder, it's so clean and fresh tasting, I drove all the way from downtown just to have some! Service can definitely be slow here but the freshness of the seafood and how nice the staff were, made up for it. What was extra awesome is that I was too full to end my meal with the spicy soup they have so they packaged the individual ingredients to go and told me how to cook it at home!!!

Honestly, I wish I could just eat everything on the menu, because when I looked around at other people's tables, everything I saw looked SO good!"}
{"text":"I come here once in a while with friends or with family and happened to come on the weekend with my family of 5. It's located in a plaza just south of Yonge and Clark in a plaza with some other Korean restaurants and a Korean supermarket. The plaza is huge but the parking is a little bit difficult. When you're entering the plaza, make sure you don't make a first left into the first row of parking spaces unless you're pretty confident you can find a spot. The reason is that if you don't find a spot, there's not way out and you'll probably have to reverse out of the lane as there's not a lot of space to 3 point turn either. 

The interior of the restaurant is a bit dimly lit but overall quite cozy. We went around 12:30 and were quickly seated in a room that could fit 6 people. They had about 3 of these rooms and also had some booths on the other side of the restaurant. All the other seating were at standard open tables. They also have tanks that contain live seafood that you can order and it's cut fresh. One thing that I have been recommended to have here but haven't gotten around to it is the live squid (which moves even after it's cut), and the flounder. 

We ordered the lunch course special which is my go-to at this restaurant. It comes with a salad, miso soup, a plate of mixed sushi, sashimi, and 3 pieces of california roll, tempura, udon, and a small bowl of green tea ice cream. For $14.95 that's a pretty good deal especially if you're like me and you like a little bit of everything. The portion is just right and left me full but not bloated. 

The sushi had a good rice to fish ratio and I liked how they gave you at least 4 different kinds. The only thing that was slightly off-putting was the white tuna which didn't have the glossy look I'm used to seeing which made me question if it wasn't as fresh as it should be. The tempura was a little too oily for my liking but it was very crispy. The udon was really good and I would come back just for the udon, even. 

Overall, the place is a good staple sushi restaurant and I'd like to try their fancier options one day. But until then, I'll probably be coming back for their lunch course special."}
{"text":"Most people come here because it is one of the only places in Toronto where you can get to eat 'live' octopus. However, I think the star of the show is really the flounder sashimi. 

Don't get me wrong, the live octopus is good, but once you've had it once, it no longer really impresses you. I think if you want to get the octopus on its own, it will be $28. If you want the set of other raw seafood delicacies, it'll be around $90 before tax. I feel like it is worth it if you're coming here for the experience of eating weird raw stuff you may have never seen before.

So I've been here three times, and all three times I've had the octopus and raw plate, whatever. That stuff got boring pretty fast, but the flounder has always been amazing and delicious. Not only is it beautiful to look at, with it's irridescent flesh, it has great texture and tastes like heaven. Definitely different from your standard salmon, tuna, butterfish, etc... sashimi. It is a bit pricey with the set ($179, I believe. And $199 for the large size) but the prortions are pretty big and can feed 6-8 people, especially if you order other dishes with it. 

The cooked dishes are okay. The salmon and chicken teriyakis always looked kind of sad.

You're probably coming here to try new and weird food. Might as well go big!

Side note: you can't reserve tables. Go early because you're probably gonna have to wait for at least half an hour during dinner rush for a seat."}
{"text":"My last day in Toronto during Christmas... and my last time I will see my best best best friend for a while because she is going to teach in Asia...
.... and surprise surprise.. there is a MAD STORM... blizzard, snowy, windy, and COLD... but that's not stopping me from seeing my best friend.
She suggested Gal's Sushi nearby and I cannot deny sushi... even on a day like today, it doesn't stop people from getting into their cars and driving for food. Parking is underground and luckily, the exit lead to right beside the sushi entrance. However, if you were to park on the ground lot, you will have to walk all the way around to the front of the restaurant.
The interior was very chic and modern - black and traditional decor. The space was very big and clean. 
The menus had a large selection which consisted of both japanese and korean cuisine. Lunch bento boxes start at $7.99 - $9.99. I, along with my bff ordered roll / sushi boxes. It came with miso soup, salad, and in the box there was approx 6 pieces of sashimi, rice, potatoes, and 6 pieces of sushi... I think there was more but I can't remember. I was so full and could not finish the whole box. The fish was very nice in both taste and cut. The rolls consisted of california, crab salad, deep fried yam... the potatoes had this nice sauce covering it, not sure how to explain it but I could not stop eating it.

Service was good and tea was always refilled. Although I love Stone Bowl Bimbipap, I'm not convinced that I will try it here. However, I would come back for lunch and even dinner if I had the chance!"}
{"text":"The sweet potato noodle was dry and hard. But I like the spicy salmon rolls because they are actually spicy. Most sushi restaurants call their salmon roll \"spicy\" despite its not."}
{"text":"Its nice to go to a place for Japanese / Korean meals that isn't AYCE.  It's a bit pricey but the food feels authentic.  I would definitely go back nevertheless.  

I ordered a bulogi bento box and my date ordered a sashimi fish bowl with rice.  I ordered spider rolls and a yellowtail fish roll.  It came up to about $60 at the end but we were definitely stuffed.  Probably didn't even need the extra side rolls.  I wish I asked for a spoon for the rice but that's my fault.

Once again, it's a bit pricey but considering the area and the residents, I'm sure the price is competitive.  Come for the authentic tasting food!"}
{"text":"I mean this stuff isn't exactly going to have you craving for it every day from here on. After all, there is really only so much weird and exotic raw stuff you can stomach in one go. Unfortunately for me a said Korean friend took me out for a joy ride (at the expense of my dignity). I seriously had no clue what he said to the waitress but she drop a whole lot of weird sh*t on our table. This isn't a place for their sashimi or sushi and call it a day, though you can if you call yourself out; chicken =P. Skip the grilled this and that or any sort rice,  noodles and the soup? Well, save that for flu season. Seriously, who eats soup? You drink that stuff and any drink sans alcohol is called cool-aid; nobody likes cool-aid after puberty! When visiting Gonoe, expect to feast on delicacies of another kind; lively tentacles of octopus, poppin', slimmin' sea cucumbers, snappy sea urchins, sea squirt (can't describe, don't want to), abalone \"hard AF\" and of course how can we forget the amusing, overachieving sea penis (yeah, it does exist but don't Google it at work, NSFW. -- I know you probably just Googled that, I played you hard! LOL) - all of this stuff in the raw. 

I am really not going to explicitly describe every single item as I vividly remembered them. Doing so may have you gagging before the end of this review.  I want you to gag (after your meal) at the very thought of this meal for the rest of your life followed by a big chuckle like a lunatic. That was a little brash! But anyhow, I would have to sum my experience and the taste of said items as \"interesting\" with a heavy does of fear and excitement at the same time. Some will delight, others disappoint and some are just creepy and weird at the same time but what remains at the end of your meal is a lasting impression, a sense of accomplishment (albeit mixed with some fear and vulgarity) and a meal to never forget. You may never do this again but then again you might just have tread waters not many dare to. You know the old saying -- just do it! YOLO!"}
{"text":"First off, this place is very Korean for a Japanese fusion restaurant. All the servers are Korean, the kitchen staff and if you order anything Korean, you will get 2 side dishes (usually cold vermicelli and honey potatoes). I've been to this place for several years and what stands out the most is their consistency. Our favorites are the \"fish egg bibimbap\", a bento box set and the chicken cutlet udon. Their prices are on the expensive side but you will get what you expect. Another plus is the take out sushi platters which are 10% off if paying in cash. Often times, there are more pieces on the platter then advertised. This place can get busy during dinner hours and weekends."}
{"text":"I used to go to Gal Sushi a lot a few years ago, but I feel their quality dropped a lot.  The fish didn't taste as fresh as it used to.  Service was okay. Their potato side dish used to be really good, but the recipe changed and they give smaller portions now."}
{"text":"I love this place, especially for their bento boxes. I enjoy the Japanese and Korean components - the potatoes!! The jap chae (a little oily sometimes)!!! I had the sashimi bento and the seafood was fresh. The price is very reasonable too $10-$13. Service is decent. Would come here time and time again."}
{"text":"Gal's Sushi is located at the right beside the hilton suites clocktower.  The area has really developed as I never really went behind the plaza.  I was pleasantly surprised when I saw a abundance of blooming restaurants.  I was referred to Gal's Sushi from a friend's glowing review and decided to try it.  

Upon entering the restaurant, you'll notice that it is usually packed.  Don't come at a good hour and expect to wait.

Gal's Sushi is a Japanese/Korean restaurant so expect two sides to the menu, one Japanese and one Korean.  In my opinion there wasn't that big of a difference.  Really... this is a korean restaurant.  If you look at the menu you'll notice duplicates in the japanese section from the korean section.

I order the sushi/sashimi everytime I come here.  The fish selection is excellent.  I usually get the \"choice\" box's because they come with better fish, unlike their other salmon filled boxes.  The choice sets come with Uni (sea urchin), tuna, hamachi (yellowtail), ahi hamachi, white tuna, mackerel, snapper, and sweet shrimp. OMG the ahi hamachi is AMAZING!

The rolls however, are below par.  I compare them to food court quality.  They are usually filled loosely and often with ingredients that have been made well before ordering it (ie. don't expect your dynamite roll to be crunchy... the tempura was made hours before).  The rice is also not flavoured properly.  It's pretty much korean/japanese rice, but you can't really taste the sugar/rice vinegar mixture that you're supposed to have with it.

I also had the gyoza, and was very disappointing.  The dough for the dumpling was really really thick (think bun, not dumpling) and didn't really compliment the texture of the dumpling.  It was like eating a tiny thin breaded bun.

The main courses were hit and miss.  One of the times I've had the spicy seafood soup on the japanese side.  When it actually came out, I noticed that there was only one mussel, a tiny piece of cuttlefish, and one shrimp.  Really... RIP OFF.

The korean side white fish spicy soup is much better.  Lots of stuff in it.  However, I noticed that the soup base was pretty much the same thing.  They probably just scoop in some ingredients, add some broth and then boil it up quickly.

The bim bim bop was actually pretty good as well.  Not the best I've ever had, but again, kinda like what you would expect at a food court.

All in all, if I were to recommend this place to someone I would say to go only for the sushi and sashimi.  For the price that they're offering it you can't really go wrong.  Perfect for lunch!  Get some sake too!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Gal's Sushi (North York) for dinner. At first I didn't know this place was called Gal's Sushi, so when I came here I was like.. why didn't we just go to the one in Markham? It's same thing no?! Turns out noo, it's not! This restaurant's specialty is their flounder's fish and it was amazzzingggg!! (They don't have the flounder fish at the Markham location) I even took my family here to try it out :D

I'd highly recommend:
* Flounder Fish Sashimi - It's super fresh! I'd recommend saving some to cook in the spicy soup (it comes with the combo)
* Spicy fish soup - It's pretty spicy when it's just a 'regular spice', so those who cannot take spiciness, ask the server for mild!

Things that were included:
* Tempura - Not a big fan of tempura but it was included as part of the combo

 You can choose either grilled fish or soju as part of the combo. We chose the grilled fish haha.. not a hardcore dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday.  Service was great and food came out fast.  Perfect for a quick lunch.  The bento boxes are very affordable at $8.99 and you get a pretty decent amount of food.  I was pretty satisfied.  Everything was delicious.  I had to deduct a point because the glass noodles were a bit too oily and I found a fish scale on one of the sashimi.  The next time I go, I'll probably try their Korean cuisine."}
{"text":"First impression when I went in was it was really nice layout & clean. Heard good stuff about this place, but right off the bat when we sat down, lady that plot down our utensils rudely was not too friendly, no greeting, no smile. Felt like I just entered an old school Chinese Restaurant. I was still courteous & said thank you, but she said nothing back. 

Ordered the lunch bento boxes & soft shell crab for appetizer. Soft shell crab was deep fried well and tasty. Our bento boxes had good & soso items. 
The rice in my bento was like a pile of smooshed rice, like someone already stir into it with chopsticks. The wasabi they gave us was smaller than a dime, I had 10 pieces of sashimi & roughly 4-5 sashimi sushi pieces, & 6 maki rolls. Didn't think that wasabi was enough for my whole meal. Pickled ginger was like 2 mini slices. The jap chae was also a little off, the texture of the noodle was rough & not smooth, didn't taste that great. The deep fried maki rolls were not bad. But even the whole bento box itself was very worn out, little the paint was coming off..

Service was not up to par. I continue to be courteous back saying thank you etc.. But nothing back in return. I don't understand why..we didn't demand anything or was rude to anyone....don't think I'll go back after this 1st experience here. I rather to go Mi-ne, better food and fantastic service!"}
{"text":"But pricey but this is a place to go if you're craving some amazing fresh sushi!

We tried the raw seafood platter with the raw flounder combo and added a small sushi and sashimi tray. We had enough to keep the cooked food for left overs!

The raw seafood was amazing. Octopus tastes like nothing but it's fun to eat. I wasn't as big a fan of the sea squirt which is fairly metallic and bitter tasting. Iodiney haha

The sashimi flounder and rest were amazing. Great texture, very fresh, nice thick pieces. And the sushi was great! Rolls and sushi were firm so it wouldn't fall apart when you picked it up. Everything tasted really fresh and really good!

Staff here are amazing. Friendly and helpful. If there are items you don't understand or aren't sure if you want to try, feel free to ask someone.

I think the price is quite high but considering it's hard to find this fresh seafood in the city, it's a nice treat :)

Ohh if your combo comes with the spicy fish soup, let them know how spicy you want it. It's really quite a hot dish!"}
{"text":"Sushi here is pretty consistently great. The rice is not all hard and sticky, but it's not too loose that it falls apart after you pick it up. 

My favorite is their pork bone soup which you can do take out for. Some times my coworkers and I order their soup for lunch at work. So good and quite a large amount of pork. :)

The service here is great! Especially Charlie. He's so friendly every time I come by. Even when it's busy, I find the server's are very attentive and quick. :) One of my favorite all around sushi spots!"}
{"text":"I was working at the Sheraton Parkway with a friend and we had time to kill at lunch so we decided to go for sushi. My buddy frequents the area and said he knew of a great place. When he told me it was Korean/Japanese I should have known better. We got there right at 11:30 when they opened so it wasn't busy. I ordered a sushi/tempura box and 2 orders of Unagi sushi as it's my favourite. My supposed Unagi arrived but it was Uni, not my favourite. The server took it away and it was replaced. It was pretty good but I've had better for less $$. The tempura was good but the sushi portions were very small. When we were finished our main meal I was looking forward to green tea ice cream but before I could even ask if they had it our bills were put on the table. Granted by this time they were busy but this is a big no-no in my books as I regularly get more to eat if it's good. My friend then tried to pay with interac and the server said there was a $20 minimum? C'mon really. I can understand $5 but that is ridiculous! Also I've never seen such expensive Toro in my life, $12.99 for 2 pieces. I might as well go to Fune or Nami!

I will definitely not return to this place."}
{"text":"The live octopus is $$$ and pretty fun as an experience.  There's nothing really special about the taste, but I understand it's hard to come by in TO.  I would come back to try more of their unique raw dishes."}
{"text":"Quality sushi for a good price. Spicy Tuna is the stand out."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place in Markham. I came for dinner and had a sashimi/sushi bento box. It had 1 roll, sushis, and sashimi along with choice of chicken/salmon teriyaki or tempura for $17.99. Bento box is very filling."}
{"text":"Knowing Gal's was amazing, this was where I had taken my girlfriend on our first date. 
Fast forward 10 months later and here we are again. 
The food is always so fresh and so delicious; never had any complaints. 
They're very busy during lunch hours so make sure you get here early!
One thing I really like is that they have this button you can press to call the servers. Quick and efficient.
Gal's will always be a special place for me."}
{"text":"This is a definitely a 3 star restaurant. Sushi are too small. Will not fill you like normal sushi restaurant. Service is pretty good. Just not happy about this thin fish sushi. Unless you like the fish otherwise you will feel $$$ at the end ."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our visit here. The sushi and sashimi were very fresh, and even though they didn't have all the cuts you might get at some other higher end places, it would be hard to say it was anything but delicious. The only thing I didn't like was they used low sodium Kikkoman soy sauce, which is a bit tasteless in my opinion. Maybe ask for some of the regular stuff. 
Most people who come here are Koreans who want to splurge on the fluke/flounder sashimi though; they're one of the few places in the city that offer it. If you don't know what that is, then you might want to try another place for your sushi fix."}
{"text":"June 7, 2018 - I went here for dinner with a friend. Everyone was nice and we didn't have to wait long to be seated even though they were busy.

We ordered the bento box meals. The portions are big. Every tasted very good."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to sushi restaurants in Markham whenever we're craving sushi. I've been here for lunch and dinner and both times have been great. Prices vary during the time of day. More expensive during dinner.

I've got to say, when the restaurant first started out in Richmond Hill, it was much better. The restaurant started out to be just a sushi place, and then opened another one next door for Korean food, and then moved to Hwy 7 and Warden. The place is definitely nicer and more spacious. I feel now that the business has been around for so long, the sushi is not as fresh as it used to be. Sometimes there would be ice left on the sashimi. 

I usually order the bento boxes which are pretty good. However, the chirashi, and anything with the assorted eggs is delicious. Not to mention, the aesthetics of the food is nice. 

The service is great. When the restaurant gets busy, there's a bell on each table to call one of the servers which is fantastic considering the size of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing for great sushi. My friends and I ordered a large platter to split between us. In the end, it was about $20 per person, but the quality was excellent. My friend ordered a bento box, and it was filled with sushi and sashimi. Definitely worth the price. This restaurant also offers both Korean and Japanese food. The only problem is that you may have to go a bit early. We went on a Saturday around 6, and it was already packed."}
{"text":"About 2 weeks ago, I was at Gal sushi on a Sunday night for dinner, ordered the sushi and sashimi platter and marinated beef soup.  I was extremely disappointed with sushi and sashimi platter, the fish were cut very small pieces, the unagi sushi was the worst I had ever tasted.  The unagi had no taste, and as soon as I place it in my mouth the unavailability melted, no textures at all, very bad quality of unagi.  
The rice that came with the soup was awful, only ate the beef and drank the soup.  As part of a Korean restaurant, they don't offer more cold appetizers to start.  The glass noodles was hard, no kimchi provided had to ask to get it.  

One odd thing I noticed was a guy from the sushi bar came out to the drinks fridge and brought some beer back to everyone behind the sushi bar....but that's not it, a few guys actually opened the bottle and started drinking, as well they should be facing the wall when drinking alcohol instead of at the customer.  I don't think that is professionalism.  This is definitely the last time I am coming here as the prices are pretty high for the low quality food I was given and the image of the restaurant was not pleasant, staff drinking while on the job."}
{"text":"Such a disappointing night today. I've been a regular customer at Gal's for some time but today was just disappointing. First my family and myself got seated but we were given just the menus and no tea, I had to ask for it for someone to bring it to me. Then our food came but we weren't given any of the appetizers so again, we had to ask for it. Nearly the end, we wanted some refills in our tea cups and when we signalled someone, one told us to wait a second and another nodded but after 5 minutes, she completely forgot. I then asked for the bill and then we were bought a tea pot but why would I need a pot of tea when I'm already just about to leave? What a sad night."}
{"text":"Modern, sexy-looking bistro that blends sushi bar and izakaya with tasty results.

Gorgeous space that stands out in this aging plaza.  For lunch, I've had the chirashi, which comes with a weird array of leafy greens on top of fresh sashimi and rice.  My partner was wowed by his sashimi bento box.  The waiter was pretty fresh on the job - he brought us ice cold beers and glasses, but didn't realize the bottles were crown caps (not screw caps)!  By the time we realized it, optimal beer drinking temperature: long gone.

I went all out for dinner - our waiter warned us on the sheer amount of dishes ordered, but I didn't care, it all sounded too good to pass up.  Onsen tamago (poached egg in dashi broth) was sublime.  Oyster shooter with quail egg was fantastic.  Grilled and thinly sliced beef tongue was outstanding.  Monkfish liver (a.k.a. foie gras of the sea) was sinful as well.  Sashimi platter was fine, but not exceptional.  They did forget one of our dishes and billed us for it, but it was quickly corrected.

To push it over the edge, Gonoe needs some refinement on the service.  The chef didn't send out any complimentary rolls or offer ice cream, even after dropping $75+ on dinner for 2, on a quiet night."}
{"text":"Lunch is a very busy time there.  Go early, or you will have to wait.  

The place is loud!  The laminate floors, un-covered tables, and relatively bare ceilings make noise bounce around like the busiest of restaurants.  So if you're more than a party of 6, you won't be talking to anyone more than 4 feet away without shouting (and slightly spitting) at them!

The food....wow, great vareity and the prices are very reasonable.  They have both Korean fare and Japanese fare.  Lunch bento boxes are great at $7.99.  the Sashimi box nets you about 8 pieces of sashimi, 6 rolls, and another 6 pieces of sushi!  That's a great deal.  THe fish was very fresh, and you can actually taste the salmon.  It wasn't bland like most \"cheap\" places, but it actually tasted great (non-fishy of course).

We also had the Pork-Bone-Soup.  Now...for a place with so much vareity, it was pretty good.  The pork was boiled long enough so the meat just falls off the bone.  The soup base was great....spicer than most places, but just right for me since I like hot.  The portion however was a bit lacking, and the little kimchi dishes were sparse at only 2.  If you're looking for good pork bone soup, this is a \"Quality over Quantity\" place.  Korean restaurants like Owl of Minerva and Nak Won provide much larger portions, lots of appetizer dishes, and you pay $1-2 less, and for the same level of quality.  This one was $7.99, so not cheap for PBS....but, it was good, and it leaves you satisfied.  Bring a bib, it gets messy!

Service:  Lots of gadgetry, they all have headsets with their 2 way radios, and they also have a button at each table to \"Buzz\" the waiters.  But...it's busy...and as hard as they are working, you do end up waiting. But like most Asian restaurants, you're there for the food and value, not the service, so don't expect too much.  I would say they are slightly better than average, but that's as far as it goes (don't expect a smile, or hear about their specials or an explanation on anything).

Overall, if you are in a big group, you may have to wait for a table, you won't be able to talk to everyone due to the noise, BUT...everyone will find something they like on the menu and the value is very good, appropriate for 95% of people's wallets.  So...good for groups, especially work groups where people have a diverse taste for food (within in the Asian fare category of course).

I would return here again, it's worth going once in a while."}
{"text":"I have not been here in a long time. The last time I went it was still called Gonoe. Have not been back often because the service was not the best. We use to come here for the unique dishes like live octopus and flounder sashimi, which were both very fresh and good. I recently went because I needed a quick lunch. Lunch on a weekday was pretty packed. I decided to order take out and it was prepared pretty quickly. Also, the lunch specials were a great deal with a lot of variety. I got the roll bento box and it was $10.95 with 6 pc of california roll, 6 pc of crab roll, 3 pc of spicy salmon roll, two pc of tofu, and small serving of japchae. I have ordered something similar at the Markham location, but the quality here is so much better. In addition, I ordered a spicy salmon handroll and it was nicely packed with salmon and not too much rice. Lastly, if you pay cash you get a 10% discount. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We recently ordered a large take our order of their party trays and was pretty satisfied! Fast service and great value! We got the large assorted roll platter which had a great selection of maki along with a premium party tray with sushi, sashimi, and rolls. Both were good!"}
{"text":"A nice Sushi / Korean restaurant. Sushi was fresh and tasted good. Lots of Salmon in the combo, it was good but a little too much. Friendly staff made it a good meal."}
{"text":"Came here for a family dinner today and I was left satisfied with the seafood combo (included the live octopus, sea cucumber, sea squirt, gaebul, and abalone for $98.95. This is definitely quite the experience and though a lot of people say that the octopus was nothing special in taste (which it wasn't), I find it seasoned with the sesame oil to be perfect for my taste buds. I'm a big seafood fanatic myself and I would recommend this to try for those who are in love with seafood as much as I am.

Moving onto what you pay for - it's really more of the texture than anything. All of the food within the combo are all crunchy and chewy texture. It's fairly portioned such that I think for 4-5 people it is good to share with.

On top of that, I ordered a large sashimi platter and the slices they've cut are very generous. Overall the more special ones were the salmon skin sashimi and that their mackerels were fresh - fresh that you don't taste the \"rawness\" of the fish as some other mackerels can have that real fishy taste.

I would come here again in the near future to try it out with other friends - I am wondering if the flounder is worth trying as well which is also sashimi slices from what I've seen from other tables."}
{"text":"Great tasting sushi and sashimi made from fresh ingredients, but a little in the pricier side.

I came for dinner and between the 4 of us we ordered a large 72 piece sushi/sashimi platter to share and we also got some maki rolls. The meal came with complementary miso soup, garden salad, and also some Korean side dishes. 

Even though 72 pieces seemed like a lot of food, but a good amount of it was actually sashimi pieces, so we actually finished everything we ordered. The sashimi pieces were mostly fresh, and it contained fish such as salmon, white tuna, real tuna, red snapper, mackerel, and yellow tail. The rolls we ordered were pretty standard, decent proportion of filling vs. rice. 

I noticed that some of the appetizers and tempura were really expensive here. For example, a plate of beef short ribs is $15 and from the picture it seems that they only give you 4 or 5 pieces of it. Tempura were rough $10 each as well, definitely way better deal to get them elsewhere at an AYCE restaurant. 

Overall, this restaurant offers standard, great tasting sushi and sashimi. Though the prices are on the higher end than what I usually pay"}
{"text":"First time here. The decor and service was standard. Came here for their lunch bento box, I ordered the vegetarian one and it was alright. I liked the glass noodles and potatoes that were in it. The best part of the box would be the sushi with the crispy edges imo. They didn't give me enough wasabi in the bento box, as I would be done with the amount provided in a hurry! All you have to do is ask, then they will give you more than enough. Would be back again next time I'm in the mood for sushi."}
{"text":"Been there several times in the past few months, always look forward to getting back.
Lunch specials are a great deal, the place is clean and the servers are friendly and professional.  I usually get the roll box and never have any complaints."}
{"text":"Gals sushi has a selection of rolls to choose from but our favourite is the Orangeville roll! Definite must try if you find yourself at this restaurant. The rice to fish ratio was perfect as well and the sashimi couldn't get any more fresh. Wished the service was a bit better but nonetheless the delicious food is worth coming back for."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times since it's within walking distance.  The restaurant is located in the plaza at Hwy7/South Town Centre Blvd.  It might be a bit confusing but the entrance to the restaurant is on the other side of the parking lot.  The restaurant is quite big, with lots of seating and nice decor.  

So far I have ordered :

L15. DukBaeGi BulGoGi (marinated beef & vegetables cooked in hot stone-pot with rice)  $8.99

L17. LA Kal Bi (BBQ LA style beef short ribs with rice)  $9.99

N3. Tempura U-Don (thick noodles in soup with tempura)  $12.99

K13. Kalbi Tang (beef short ribs in soup with clear noodle & vegetables with rice)  $11.99

N2. Chicken Katsu U-Don (thick noodles in soup with deep fried chicken cutlet)  $12.99

The food here was delicious, well presented, and didn't take long to cook.  No complaints about the food so far, except that it's a bit pricey.  I have yet to try the sushi but I hear it's quite fresh here.

The service could be better though.  Last time I was there, I overheard the waiter yelling at a table for asking about the afternoon specials when they missed it by 2 minutes.

Overall, a great place to bring your friends for Japanese/Korean if you don't mind the slightly high prices and inconsistent wait staff."}
{"text":"Just as good as the first time. 

I really liked our waitress. She put down the potato side dish on our table and she noticed how little potatoes were on the dish so she grabbed one she had on her tray which had more potatoes.

The pork neck soup was fall off the bone amazing just like the first one I had."}
{"text":"This place is the worst... Worst stomach ache ever after eating here.  Just came here for lunch and right after had a horrible stomach ache.. 

Would never come back to this place ever.. Sushi and Sashim is not even preserved properly. When I got my bento box the sashimi was warm... This place is atrocious.. Quality of the food is so bad. I just feel this place is so dirty. Would never recommend anyone to this horrible restaurant. 

Never going back to this place again..... This place is on par with Matsuda Don Mills. holy fu**... another place to burn."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times already and everything is pretty consistent. The quality is definitely better than ayce and the price is reasonable. They have Japanese and Korean food so there's a lot of choices. 

There's complimentary jap chae (Korean glass noodles with veggies), salad, miso soup, and potatoes in some sort of sweet and sour sauce which are delicious. The sushi is fresh and they come out really fast since there's like 4/5 sushi chefs behind the sushi bar. The best choice tray is really fresh and delicious. If you get takeout and pay with cash there's a 10% discount. 

Korea food: I've also tried the pork bone soup ($13.99) which is huge and filling with the bowl of rice. The kkang pung gi - fried chicken with hot pepper sauce - is basically sweet and sour pork with a little bit of spice. Not worth $14.99 since it doesn't even come with rice. Kalbi is also good but u only get 6 pieces for $10.99. 

Overall a good option if u don't want ayce since the prices and portions are definitely reasonable."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this sushi place so I decided to try it out. We came during end of lunch hour. 

Lunch boxes 8.99 good choices and selections... looked pretty fresh, taste of sashimi and rolls were just okay. I thought it was under whelming. 

They have bell at the table so we were able to get service which I thought the speed of service and amount of time from ordering to delivering food is fairly fast. I'm not sure if that means they keep things premade in the kitchen...

The place was super loud during lunch, not relaxing at all. I'm not sure if dinner is better but I don't understand all the hype."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and it was good.

Staff: They have buttons to help page waiters which I appreciated because sometimes it's hard flagging down waiters. They great thing is they came quickly and would always smile and help with anything we needed.

Ambience: It was comfortable. We had a nice side booth that could fit at least 6 people (we were a party of 5). Everything seemed in good working order.

Food:Nothing too spectacular. I ordered a Chicken Katzu Udon which had a lot of meat and was very filling. I also tasted some of the rolls which were great too except too much mayonnaise for me. Overall, not too bad.

I'll probably come back since I'm nearby but it is far from my top choice for sushi."}
{"text":"When I walked in, I guess they had just opened and there weren't a lot of people - I was a bit more eased when near the end of our meal, there were tons :).  

The food is okay - definitely not horrible but definitely not mind blowing.  I had the bimbimbap and the bf had the gamjatang (pork bone soup).  Quite honestly, I think I liked his dish way more.  My bimbimbap pretty much had to be coated in hot sauce in order for it to be remotely flavourful and there was probably as much meat as the size of my thumb (and I have small fingers). His soup, however, was pretty awesome.  

Service was very fast and the waitress was good.  I was not brave enough to try the sushi but according to some people it's great.  I'm willing to give this place another try, just based on the fact that I might not have ordered the right dish!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting place. Excellent lunch deals to be had, service at the ring of a bell and not really any service otherwise. The place is hopping at lunch time and there is no rush as the servers seem a bit overrrun.

My L4 bento box was a great deal, but I did have fishy burps an hour afterwards. I sampled some of the agedashi tofu which was delicious. Lots of tea, one we rang for it.

Recommend parking underground which is plentiful."}
{"text":"I used to come to Gals pretty often and I always thought it was 3-star worthy until my latest visit with my family changed my mind. 

I used to order the same things every time I went (lunch bento, spider roll and Sashimi tray) and I thought the food was OK but I never personally craved it. I do like that they give you only potatoes and glass noodles for the side since they are the only two that I ever liked). This time around my bro ordered a few things that I never thought to try and it changed my mind about Gals! 

MUST TRY: 
1. Lobster salad roll (so so so so good) 
2. Salmon egg bibimbap 
3. Chicken karrage (spelling? kind of spicy for me but I love it) 
4. Spider roll (still good) 
5. Seafood Udon 

Their sashimi is pretty fresh too so I would recommend trying that as well. 

Looks like I'll be returning to Gals more often that I thought!"}
{"text":"I never understood the hype for this place. I came here occasionally when the place first opened, but stopped going because I was never satisfied with the food. About 2 years later, I finally decided to return here now that Toro Sushi closed down and I didn't want to think of any other excellent, affordable sushi restaurants around the area.

I will say this, they improved. A little. I originally would give this place 2 stars, but my dinner last night will allow me to move it up to 3 stars. The service has definitely improved, and their selections have also somewhat improved. We ordered A7 sushi platter to share with 3 people, which was just enough, and fit right into our budget as well. As the rating says, the food is A-OK. The fish variety is certainly lacking, but for what they have they do it well. For the price we paid, I suppose I won't argue much for better fish variety, but I am still trying to get over the fact Toro Sushi closed...and this place just isn't cutting it in my opinion.

From my high school adventures to this restaurant for lunch/other events to my post-university experience here...quite a lot has changed in terms of decoration, but in terms of the food itself...it's okay. I'll live."}
{"text":"This is my go-to restaurant when I'm craving some quality sashimi. Service is always friendly and prompt here. I've tried the lunch bento boxes and some of the Korean soups which were pretty decent. For this particular visit, we came here on a Friday night and we were seated right away as it wasn't very busy around 8 pm. We ordered the assorted sushi and sashimi (30 pieces for $29.99). It came with miso soup, salad, and Korean banchan which were japchae and sweet potatoes. I enjoyed eating the sashimi more than the sushi, as it tasted very fresh and light. This meal is meant for two people but I found that the portions were big enough to fill three people. Overall, I'd highly recommend Gal's for people looking to grab a quick and satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"If you're interested in trying the live sashimi, then definitely give Gonoe a visit, otherwise it's just A-OK in my books. 

Located in a busy plaza of Yonge Street, parking will likely be a challenge (considering there are a number of busy restaurants around). The restaurant itself looks fairly standard for a sushi shop and didn't stand out (positively or negatively). Service was also standard and was nothing memorable in my books.

The highlight at Gonoe is definitely the live sashimi. We're talking octopus that's still moving when you put it in your mouth. A really cool experience if you can handle it! Our group had lots of fun with our live sashimi. We also ordered a number of other more typical sushi / sashimi dishes, which overall, I found pretty fresh. The reason I'm only giving this place a 3 is because of the price. I think I can find similar quality sashimi / sushi for a cheaper price which is one of the reasons I likely won't be visiting in the near future but would still recommend to others looking to try / experience the live sashimi."}
{"text":"Standard and fresh sushi in Markham, I always visit Gal's for their sushi combos.

Located off Hwy 7, Gals looks pretty typical for a sushi joint. Service is good with the servers being quick and respectful. There used to be waiting time on busy nights but recently I've been able to grab a seat walking in on any night. 

I usually go for one of the sushi combos which can consist of a mix sushi, sashimi or rolls. I've always found their sushi and sashimi fresh and definitely a step above ayce places. Takeout sushi actually works pretty well here and you get a discount if you pay cash! The also serve a number of hot dishes like Korean soup based dishes, dumplings, dons, noodles and more. I think pricing is reasonable. Ordering comes with free soup, salad and a few Korean side dishes.

I'd recommend trying if you're in Markham and looking for some good sushi."}
{"text":"Gal's is a 4 star for their bento boxes, and a 3 star for their Korean dishes.  Well, the pork bone soup I tried, at least.  The meat barely had flavour while the soup was pretty delicious.  Did not touch the potato in the soup because a) way too mushy b) underwhelmingly bland.

Their bento boxes are priced around $20 for a choice of tempura/teriyaki/bulgogi - and they all come with 6 pieces of rolls, rice, sashimi, and salad.  It's a really filing meal and the side dishes include glass noodles and sweet potatoes (SO good).  The service is fairly fast and the place is usually filled with people on nights and weekends.  Proves their popularity :P"}
{"text":"so I went back on tuesday, apparently the manager was a different one. 
for me, sushi chef should have the whole control on how he need and wants to prepare and serve the food, not the manager.
on monday, the manager let the chef to do what the customer wants.
on tuesday, different manager said. sorry, if we don't have it in the menu, you can't have it. 
... so, if you want to get a good sushi, skip tuesday.
monday was good for sure, I haven't been back there yet. (disappointed)."}
{"text":"For the price, quality, and quantity, this is the place to go. Yes, this place is not considered top tier sushi for connoisseurs out there but for a quick sushi fix with large quantity and for a decent price, I would really recommend this place. 

They also provide banchans as the restaurant is owned by Koreans. You also receive salad, soup and green tea ice cream after ordering a meal. I typically like to get the chirashi here as the portions are ridiculous and they always hook it up with a large variety of sashimi. They even hook it up with scallop sashimi!!! In terms of freshness, this place is actually great for the price. 

Overall, this is my go-to place for a quick sushi fix. Though it shares the same name as the Gal's Sushi in Markham, it is not the same thing!!!"}
{"text":"Big place, nicely decorated, korean owned place I believe as they have both japanese and korean dishes, came here for lunch, they have a lunch specials for bento boxes starting at 9.99, comes with salad and miso soup, more than enough food, I had quite a bit of leftover....service was good and prompt"}
{"text":"Two of the things I don't like about Gal's continue to be the attitude of the servers, and the fact that  the dinner plate is the same as lunch plate,  they charge you more during dinner.  Haven't  been here for close to a year even  though it is right across from where I live.  Tonight's experience is no surprise.   The servers were  complaining about  things in the dining hall amongst themselves.  They also had trouble my English. Food quality is sustainable.  Plean in general,  although the manager was bleeding his nose in the dining room.  One of the kitchen staff  was  during fish  so close to the dining hall so loud that the whole hall  quieted down. That's all you could  hear for  two  segments of 15 minutes. It was ULTRA ANNOYING!!  For sure not customer oriented approach.  Cuisine wise, it is a Korean owned and managed business, selling Japanese and Korean food, now with some Chinese staff."}
{"text":"Gal's sushi is pretty ok. I came for dinner with some friends and the service was pretty good. I ordered a dinner bento with salmon teriyaki and it was ok. Not AYCE, which is kind of nice."}
{"text":"First things first, I love Gals Sushi, but the reason the rating is so low is because the dinners are FREAKING OVERPRICED!

Gal's lunches are great, very generous with portion sizes, and incredibly reasonably priced. I've ordered from both the bento box menu and the Korean lunch menu, and neither have ever disappointed me. 

Try to get there for either an early or late lunch, as it can get very very busy during peak lunch hours. The parking lot is a poop-show, so...  Try not to die?

Dinner? Don't even bother. While I like Gals and think the quality is ALRIGHT, I would much rather spend that money on somewhere a little more high-end. I've spent $50 on a small sized tray of sushi for takeout before and was thoroughly disappointed at how scantily clad the quanities were, let alone the pretty mediocre quality."}
{"text":"One of the few places that was open on New Year's Day. I came with my mom for lunch and it was packed. The place is fairly clean, mostly packed with a young, hip Asian crowd.

Solid Korean food all around. The only two complaints I had was:

1) the potato pan chan was too sweet, and 
2) I got berated for requesting vegetarian soon dubu

Having lived in South Korea, I'm used to long, hard stares of incredulity. The judgement I got for making a dietary request wasn't too surprising to me; the ajuma nearly refused to take my request. I had to convince her other Korean restaurants have no problems with this and that I'd eaten soon dubu sans meat many times in my life. When it did come, it was all worth it! 

I just hope that the waitress stops giving herbivores the stinkeye, or else she's going to flip off other customers."}
{"text":"Update review:

I used to love Gal's Sushi.. it was high quality sushi and Korean food all in one place..and a great dinner spot with friends throughout highschool and university.

I recently came here and was extremely disappointed. We arrived for dinner at 6 and surprisingly.. for the huge decline in food quality.. this place was still at capacity.

I ordered the 18 pc maki combo ($15).. it came with 6 pcs spicy salmon, 6 pcs shrimp tempura and 6 pcs crab meat maki.

The rice was awful. Just looking at it you could tell that it was mushy and too wet. Upon tasting it.. it was mushy and warm.. something tells me they ran out of sushi rice and used regular rice they serve with the Korean dishes and just slapped something together. I'm not sure if I had a one-off experience.. but this is definitely the last time I am coming here as the prices are pretty high for the low quality food I was given."}
{"text":"A good spot to get a bento box to go. Reasonable prices and good sushi. Expect to wait in line during lunch rush."}
{"text":"expensive small portions and not authentic korean//japanese food
been here roughly 5 times cause a friend likes it, and each time i leave still hungry"}
{"text":"Waitress, not the food, left a bad taste in our mouths.  There's a right way and a wrong way for a waitress to discuss the tip she was given. Whether she intentionally set out to embarrass us or not, the point was lost.  I usually don't have a problem with servers' level of English, in this case, this impediment seriously impacted the finesse and subtlety required to handle this matter."}
{"text":"Was in the area and the kids wanted some Japanese so decided to swing by and give Gal's a try for an early dinner.

Located at Hwy 7 and Warden, Gal's Sushi serves Japanese and Korean fare in a modern setting.

This place is usually quite busy with sit down and take out orders but to be honest not sure why as the food was very mediocre at best.  I really wanted to like the place but the appetizers, sushi and entrees were all just okay as nothing stood out as the quality was similar to an AYCE buffet. 

Service was nice but the food all came out at different times and the servers seemed a bit overwhelmed at times as the place really got busy during the dinner rush.

Not sure if we will be back anytime soon so 2.5 outta 5 for me."}
{"text":"The quality of sushi here is exceptional and you pay the price for it. I would always prefer high quality sushi than lesser quality for cheaper prices. Sushi depends so much on quality that you can't compare the prices directly. The wait was 30 minutes on a Sunday evening. Service was mediocre. Food was delicious and would definitely come back. Ordered the sashimi platter along with the live octopus and lobster roll. I highly recommend the lobster roll."}
{"text":"I've come here for take out last year, and the food and service was good.

This time, i ordered the T9 Party Tray (100pc). And it looks like the picture in their menu!!

It was good! nicely put together, and its in a huge tray. Good price for this tray, and its 10% off when paying with cash.

I picked this up on a Sunday around 3pm, and it was pretty busy inside."}
{"text":"I really like this place, 

Been here a few times. Ordered their regular dishes as well as their premium cuts.  This place has high quality sashimi in stock.

Would recommend this place for toro, o'toro, botan Ebi, live octopus, beef Tataki. Their sashimi selection and quality has never let me down when I want premium!

Only problem with this place is they don't take RSVP and their is always a line up - but that says something about the restaurant!!

Recommend going here early to beat the dinner rush!"}
{"text":"Place has been around for years, that says something about the restaurant.

This place is Korean run, it's not a bad place for Japanese food.

It's comfortable for parties of 2 to 6 people.. And the price is reasonable and selection is also fair.  Food comes pretty fast and is well staffed.

Not your high end Japanese restaurant.. Pound of salmon sashimi take-out is 17.25 including tax."}
{"text":"Decided to go to Gal's Sushi for the first time today at lunch time. When we entered, we saw that the place was busy (a good sign), luckily there was space for us. My wife and I both decided to have the lunch specials ( Bento boxes for 8,99$).   I had the sushi, sashimi, roll Bento box. There was a good variety and good amount in the box. Everything tasted good. Both of us were full when we finished. They even offer 10% off if you pay by cash. Will certainly return to try some of the Korean dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"I have been to Gal Sushi many time, and I definitely place too much hope in this restaurant. See, I've been to the restaurant when it first opened, and watched the restaurant grow as it moved from highway 7 and Warden to where it is now. 

Yesterday is the last time I will ever be going. Please hear me out, there is BETTER SUSHI IN MARKHAM/RICHMOND HILL.
*quality is bad - the fish, and especially the sashimi tuna was hard to chew, and got stuck in your teeth. (i'm no food critic, but i know when that is bad)
*my mum and i both felt sick after eating the raw fish, and it was not a good feeling in my stomach
*when you ask for potato instead of rice in your bento box, they give you 4 tiny pieces of potato

The good is that the food comes quickly and the waiters are relatively nice. 

But overall, the quality has really decreased from where it once was, and I will be refusing to go to Gal Sushi ever again. Its had too many second chances from me."}
{"text":"an OK place. though sashimi not the greatest.  i would stick to the maki rolls, tempura etc.  korean is a bust.  a little over priced for what you get.  quality sucks and apps not as good relative to others.  this place is not bad to hit up for sushi cravings though since price is decent.  there are other jap restaurants that rank much better in terms of quality food a la carte for same price. service is more chinese style. fast.  black sesame ice cream AMAZING. atmosphere awesome. always busy and decor nice. recommend only if craving for sushi and in the area."}
{"text":"I tried to come here to eat after I landed from the airport and it's only 10:30pm.  The group is standing outside smoking and saying it's closed.

Too bad."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends and we had a great time. The sushi was fresh and there were plenty of options. With that being said, I didn't quite spot anything on the menu that stood out to me, but they had a good selection all the same. I'd definitely come back here if I am in this particular area."}
{"text":"I usually come here for an early lunch around 11.30-12. It gets very packed during lunch hours so be sure to get here early.
The lunch menu consists of different variations of the bento box. My go-to is the sushi and sashimi lunch at 10.99. It never disappoints. The fish is always fresh and although the glass noodles are a little on the oily side, you can substitute it for potatoes or rice etc. 
Overall the food is great and for $11, you get your money's worth. Give it a try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"I live in Toronto but whenever I want a good Sushi meal it is worth the drive to Markham.

We order meal A7 which is 48 piece sushi combo, and it leaves the two of us stuffed, I heartily recommend it.

In addition to great food, the staff is very friendly and goes out of their way to make you feel welcome.

Do yourself a favour and check this place out, you will be a fan."}
{"text":"Parking lot is in the back which may be inconvenient for some. The ordering system is quite unique - you press a button and the waitress will come to your table which will definitely be good news for people who get discouraged by laggy waitresses! 

Food: 4.5/5
I ordered the spider roll and loved it - large portions and very crispy and fresh. As I didn't eat breakfast that morning, this one roll was enough to fill me up

Service: 4/5 
Service was enhanced due to the button system - waitress was also nice and refilled our tea in a timely manner

Price: 3/5
The cost of my spider roll was quite expensive compared to other places I've been to - around $20 after tax and tip. If you want to get your money's worth, try out their wide selection of bento boxes! I heard you could also substitute some parts of the bento box if you so choose"}
{"text":"I would rank it a 3.5 +. I went here with my bff & we both ordered the lunch special. I had the L3 $7.99& she had the L4. Lemme tell u.... I nearly wanted to pack some stuff but didn't (big mistake). We were bloody FULL cuz we tried to eat everything. The lunch special came with a small soup & salad. 

Service was alright. The food came out fast! Also, we were there 30 mins after it opened and 15 later the place was buzzing with ppl. Would def. come back here for lunch! It was a great deal & it was clean here too.

I had trouble finding it at first. Just remember the restaurant faces highway 7! You have to walk out & u'll see it :) Lots of parking underground as well."}
{"text":"Gonoe Sushi is not bad but also not great. We came here because of the live octopus they serve and it was definitely an experience. The sushi, sashimi and maki rolls were quite average. Service was mediocre.

The live octopus was definitely very interesting and a fun dish to get. Mind you it will set you back $28. The moving octopus tentacles are served with two different dipping sauces on the side, sesame oil and salt or a kimchi sort of spicy sauce. The suction cups will try very hard to stick to any surface. 

As mentioned the sushi, sashimi and maki rolls are very average. We ordered a large sashimi boat and a small sushi and maki combo. About the same quality as an AYCE Japanese restaurant. The sashimi was cut way too thick and large. Nothing special.

We were also given a spicy seafood salad on the house. This has an overpowering kimchi dressing which takes away from all the other flavour. Would not order it again.

Service was pretty slow. Apparently our server was new but we had to ask for a tea refill five times before getting a refill. We actually got our tea because we asked for the bill... Lol

The only special thing about this restaurant is the live octopus, nothing else stands out. Give it a try if you're feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"This place is alright and a decent place to go to because it's close to where I live. It's kind of hard to find because it faces highway 7 and when you park it's usually on the inside or underground so finding it involves usually walking through the 1st floor of the building or walking around because they have an outdoor entrance (besides St. Louis)

It's more on the pricier side of sushi in my opinion but I think the value for what you get is fair. It's pretty average and I've been to worse in Markham (Yellow Tail). Gal's has lunch specials so the bento boxes are better priced and come with a decent amount of stuff so that is usually my go to dish. It's like your typical bento box set elsewhere comes with miso soup, salad, rice, and your choice of a couple of sides to customize the box. The appetizers are generally more expensive.

I'd go back to this place and it is a place I've been to multiple times. It's not bad but it also doesn't stand out that much."}
{"text":"This my go to place for Japanese lunch specials. They have bento specials that start at 9.99 with miso and salad it you eat in. If you choose to get that for take out, you get 10% off and no miso soup or salad. Either way it is a pretty good deal.
I usually get the box with the sashimi or tempura and the quality has been pretty consistent. I also sometimes visit for dinner, and order one of the party trays. The party trays offer a wide assortment of sashimi to try  at a steeper price than their lunch deals. This place is not a high end sushi place, but a nice consistent place at an affordable price point."}
{"text":"This has always been our go to place for sushi in Markham. 

You're always seated with glass noodles, a salad and miso soup (which is a tad too salty).
The rolls, sushi and sashimi have always been in great quality and consistent every time. But beware the sushi, they always put a dab of wasabi between the fish and rice. 

They also serve Korean food. The bulgogi is really good (a tad salty) but it is the pork bone soup that is amazing as the meat just falls off.

It does get quite busy during lunch and dinner but they also have this neat button call system where you don't have to frantically wave your arms to get their attention. 

There is parking but there is more space underground. 

We also do take out, which takes them about 10-15 minutes for pick-up. If you pay with cash there's a 10% discount."}
{"text":"Food: 2/5 
Atmosphere: 3/5
Service: 3/5
Price: 3/5

I've heard many good things about Gal's Sushi, so I decided to try it once myself. I absolutely love Japanese (and Korean) food, so I'm always up for trying new restaurants.

Atmosphere:
The restaurant was packed on a weekday, so it was incredibly loud. I went with a friend and I was almost literally shouting at him just to hold a conversation, while having to repeat ourselves many times. The tables were also very packed/close together, which didn't really help the situation. 

The restaurant setting is very casual, so I'd say it makes for a good family restaurant, but if you're hoping to go there to have an actual conversation and to sit and relax, you can definitely find better for the same price. I definitely do not recommend Gal's if you're going with one other person, as conversing across the table, given the noise, isn't easy at all. 

Service: 
Given the amount of customers, I'd say they are quite short-staffed. They have 3 waiters, one of which doubles as the host. Although eye contact was made with 2/3 waiters, it took quite awhile for a waiter (not even the host) to seat us. They were busy, so it's understandable, but some acknowledgement wouldn't hurt. 

They were prompt in taking orders and the food came fast, but when I needed to ask for the bill. I had my hand raised for the longest time, and two of the waiters passed our table and either didn't see or ignored my raised hand.Saying excuse me was out of the question unless I literally wanted to scream at them. 

Food: 
I think their selection and sets are wonderful, albeit a bit pricey. It's nice to have a mix of Korean and Japanese, especially since there are a lot of people who may not like raw fish. I love both, but ended up ordering the Teriyaki Salmon dinner set and some Uni Sushi (sea urchin). The dinner set had rice, grilled salmon, maki, sushi, and sashimi, and it came with miso soup and a green salad. Very nice variety. The uni was reasonably priced. 

The quality of the dinner set sushi/sashimi was so-so, in my opinion. I feel that they could've done better, and my impression is that the \"good\" pieces are saved for the sashimi/sushi sets. Unfortunately, I did get sick the next day (having eating nothing in between) and I'm an avid sushi/sashimi eater, so it was a bad experience for me. Given their good reviews, I'd say I was probably just very unlucky, but it does make it hard to want to come back after an experience like that.  

Price:
The price is reasonable for the quality and variety. Everything was so-so, and the price is... reasonable. It's not amazing, but you might be able to find better quality for the same price, in my opinion. 

All in all, Gal's is a decent place, and I'd probably frequent it if I worked or lived in that area, since they have lunch sets that seem pretty nice. If you're going with more than 4 people, you may want to make a reservation. However, I probably won't be going there again, due to my bad food experience."}
{"text":"Sushi here was pretty good, the price was extremely worth it and the fish was fresh! Definitely will come here again when i visit canada again."}
{"text":"I've been back here more recently and it feels the quality has dipped. It's still better than similarly priced AYCE fare, but not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to come here for lunch during the week, as she was craving sushi. I looked at the reviews and felt that the place would serve us decent food. First off, the location is somewhat difficult to find.. We drove around the plaza and could not see it. The parking lot is on the opposite side of the building, so the restaurant is facing hwy 7. 

Once we finally got there, it was half full so we were able to get a booth for ourselves. I really liked their menu, as it illustrates the majority of its menu items with pictures of the actual food. So when I was ordering my bento, I knew exactly what was coming. 

Our waitress was very accommodating and did her best to help us. My sister really dislikes salmon (I know, I don't understand it either...), so she asked the waitress to substitute her pieces of salmon sashimi for anything else. The waitress agreed and didn't charge us extra for the substitution. So, my sister has the sushi+sashimi bento and I had the chicken teriyaki combo and the sushi appetizer.

The bentos looked great and we were both hungry, so we dug in right away! Everything tasted great in my opinion, but one thing was a bit off. When my sister and I both tried the sushi, we were surprised to find that there was wasabi already added on the rice underneath the fish itself. Now, to me that was okay, but to someone like my sister who avoids spices it was not. We asked the waitress about this and she informed us that this was the traditional way to make sushi. I don't disagree, that may be true..however, we've never encountered this at any other location. She told us that we were supposed to inform her while ordering that we didn't want the wasabi. Only problem was that nowhere was it written on the menu that they do that. 

Regardless, she switched my sister's sushi and everything was fine. We both enjoyed our lunch and were full for a while. I would definitely come back again and maybe try some of their Korean items! So, the food was good and the service was great."}
{"text":"Gal's is a great little spot in Markham to quench your sushi cravings. You all know Osaka is my go to and #1 if all times!

Thursday night I had dinner with a friend and this was probably my 3rd time at Gal's, the first two being my pre Yelp days.

The good...
- Food came quickly and quality is great.
- Korean options on the menu which I love!
- playing is beautiful, they put thought and care in, kudos chef!
- Food is fresh and delicious.
- quite a big venue for a sushi spot..i am used to tiny spaces with elbow to elbow seating.
- Server Charlie was very quick to get to us and get our orders in.
- sushi rolls are creative!

The bad....
- Parking situation is maddening, literally never a spot free! Get there and be prepared to drive and drive till a spot frees up.
- Service was slow and the house wasn't full so what's the issue? Rang the bell 4 times before we got water and ended up cancelling on taking some to go because the wait staff took forever.
- they used to serve a digestive drink after your meal now you get 2 crappy candies -_- 


Overall I'll ve here again, very consistently great food!"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here, I heard lots of great things so I expected a lot. Went for a lunch special this time instead of going for dinner and got a L4. Really enjoyed the miso soup and the spicy salmon. It had a nice soft and fresh texture. The sashimi on the other hand was a bit disappointing, some were a bit slimy and even had some fish scales stuck between them, none the less, some were good as well

The price was average compared to other sushi places but it wasn't that filling"}
{"text":"The lunch course meal is a great deal where you can taste different food such as sushi, tempera, sashimi, rolls and udon. 

There was way more food than I thought... for 15$ that's definitely a deal! The sashimi is fresh and quality is much more better than ayce. I would definitely come back to try their sashimi boat and popular live octopus. 

Service is attentive and gave us time to decide on what to order."}
{"text":"Great sushi and bento boxes for lunch! Parking is a little crazy. Restaurant is always packed so try to go early on weekends."}
{"text":"I hate the service here. After eating we clicked the table button and I guess we didn't see the server come up b/c I just hear a woman scream, \"WHAT!\". I was so shocked that I quickly blurted out, \"oh could we get the bill?\" Then when they drop off the ice cream she just slammed it down without looking. Ohh kay. I told myself I was never coming here (the last time the wait was so long bc of understaffing) but was forced to come again b/c a friend suggested we all meet at this place for dinner. Second time affirmation that their service is so not worth coming for.. go to another sushi place please. Plus, the atmosphere sucks as it is dark and dingy in there... not bright or welcoming at all."}
{"text":"One of the worst sushi places  I have ever tried , much as I want to say mediocre I'm sorry but my palate cannot fathom the slimy batter of the kam poongki which I had such a high expectations having had the dish in another Korean place. you guys can do better than this place . The sashimi were frozen and not even an attempt for a better quality . First time I tried salmon sashimi with thick Skin on !!! We only had two appetizers even if both of us ordered a meal.. I have to end this review because I've to wash my mouth of the awful taste with the new dessert place behind Gal's"}
{"text":"I'm not usually in this neighbourhood so I can't compare it to anything else nearby, but my first experience was great! 

I typically eat out downtown and I've had my fair share of sushi downtown. Gal's sushi is a big place and we (a group of 4) were seated quickly in a booth. It was early for dinner time so it wasn't too crowded but it quickly filled up. We ordered a large sushi/sashimi/roll platter and a couple other things to split. The sushi rice was great and proportionately used with the fish, the fish was flavourful and fresh, and the rolls were not bad. The bigger the platter, the more variety you get, so I encourage you to go with a bunch of friends (or just a small but very hungry group) so you can try more different items. The total came to about $20 per person, which is more than I would normally want to spend on a sushi meal, but it was a good meal. I would rather rate it a 3.5 as it was above average, but only slightly...I still prefer downtown. I'd come back again if I was in the area and looking for a good sushi place."}
{"text":"Let's keep this simple - it's fast and it's furious!

I always get take out with Gal's because their service is amazingly.... FAST! 
Everytime I call in, regardless of how big the order is, they always tell me on the phone: \"Okay! No problem! Come by in 15 minutes!\" It amazes me how fast they go because that's how long it takes me to get there anyway sometimes. 

The sushi I would say is okay - pretty consistently o..k.. - but for that price, it can't get any better.
So if you're ever looking for a quick fix for dinner, call Gal's! They can do everything for 15 minutes! 

I'm definitely looking forward to trying their Korean food though!"}
{"text":"This is our regular go to place for a good Japanese lunch.  Came here around 12:30pm today and as usual it was pretty busy.  Luckily we still got a table.  Even if it's full, the wait time should not be too long as the food is served super fast.

The lunch deals here are amazing - sashimi lunch bento with miso soup and salad for only $9.99.  We got 2 sets and one order of the takoyaki (fried octopus balls)  which I always have to get if I come here.  The sashimi was really fresh and love the Japchae (Korean style sweet potatoes noodles stir fried in sesame oil and veggies) and the rolls that are part of the lunch set.  That's a price that's difficult to beat!"}
{"text":"Over priced Korean food and not good quality Japanese sushi. I've been here many time for work lunches and will not be coming back. Not worth the price and service is bad."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my family. We got the roll lunch box and the tempura sushi box. Lunch comes with soup and salad. The photos in the menu are misleading as the portions look quite adequate when in actuality they are quite small. If I did not drink two cups of tea and half a glass of water I think I'd still be hungry. Taste is good though. 

Service needs improvement. They seem to serve you everything you need at the start, like give you utensils and tea, and then it's like they forget you. I finished my tea and water early on and no one came by to ask how we were doing or refill our drinks."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with some of my colleagues from work.  we checked out the menu I was really pleased to see a lot of great selection. I selected the Fuji Mountain and was not too sure what I was going to get but what arrived was absolutely delicious. I've been to a lot of different sushi places and this one by far is the best. I highly recommend that if you like sushi you should be going here. The prices were very reasonable and the quality food was exceptional. I give it two thumbs up. If you get a chance definitely go and check this place out it's worth it"}
{"text":"Good selection of sushi if you're in the area for a decent bite. Parking is kinda weird though since this restaurant is facing Hwy 7, so you'll have to park round back and walk. It's not the most convenient location in terms of parking, not to mention parking in this plaza is always a mission.

Their lunch combos area a pretty good deal. You get a varied selection of the usual bento boxes and other types of mains as well. Asides from the usual Japanese menu items, there's also Korean dishes at the back of the menu. One thing I didn't really like were their Korean noodles, which I found to be quite greasy... other than that, everything on their menu are pretty decent.

Prices are a pretty good deal too; nothing too expensive for what you're getting and portions are not skimpy.

The restaurant itself is pretty big, but can get busy on the weekends. Waiting time isn't long though; you'll usually get a table within 15 minutes or so, so reservations (I'd say) isn't necessary.

Servers are also quick and well-mannered, which is always awesome.

Overall, good place for a sushi fix if you're in the area (don't expect anything fancy though)."}
{"text":"I really did enjoy my first visit here for dinner. First off, the service was amazing. The staff were friendly and helpful. The decor was also very nice. The food itself was excellent. The sashimi dish we ordered was very fresh and high quality and the salmon was \"sweeter\" than what I've had at other places and the combo box was larger than I thought it'd be. The free appetizers and cute carved-out orange and red bean pudding dessert were also an awesome touch! I'd definitely recommend this place to any sushi-goer in Markham or the area. By the way, I went during off-peak hours and it was still busy so I expect it'd be quite busy if anyone's going during normal dinner hours (aka, book or RSVP in advance!)"}
{"text":"This place simply rocks! I'm from metro NY/NJ and we have great sushi but this place has better! We had a generous 89 piece combo bowl consisting of sushi, sushimi, and multiple rolls. The live scallop was out of this world.  The folks I was with were talking about this place the next day and would have gone back if it was open past 11pm, this after we had dinner at a downtown Italian place. No doubt the some of the best sushi I've ever had, go here if your in the area. A+++"}
{"text":"Nothing truly spectacular. Overall a decent sushi place, although I think their rice is slightly overcooked. Fish is fresh and nicely sliced, though don't expect the best cuts. If you're a sushi freak, you'll know what I mean, if not you can disregard that note. On a plus side you get some free side dishes, a nod to the Koreanness of the place.
To be enjoyed if in the area, but there are plenty of similar establishments all over GTA."}
{"text":"Have been a regular here ever since they've opened! This is my number 1 go-to restaurant whenever I'm craving Korean or Japanese food!

They've had quite a big staff change since they opened but food is still good!

Gal's offers some of the best deals for sushi, especially lunches! I usually get their lunch bentos which are around $10, size is good and taste is good! Personally, I think that L4 is the best deal. High quality fish and very filling. 

If you want to change something in your bento, it's free of charge (as long as the things you're changing are the same price)! If you're not sure, you can ask your server! 

All dishes come with soup and salad. You only get the side dishes if you order a Korean dish. You can ask for kimchi too! Also, the side dishes are refillable!

Service is usually good, never experienced anything really bad before so keep it up! I remember there used to be this super cute Korean waiter though, but he doesn't work there anymore *cries* 

ANYWAYS, it's one of my favourite restaurants of all time! Good quality Korean and Japanese food, so give it a try if you haven't!"}
{"text":"Sunday lunch at 1:00PM and the place was packed! Luckily we didn't have to wait for a table of 4. Modern decor, plenty of booths and table seating.

All of the servers had ear pieces that made you feel as if they were secret agents. Later realized that once you press the little service button at your table they all stop what their doing and look at you. I suppose the earpiece tells them what table wanted their attention. We felt super awkward!

Gal's serves up Japanese and Korean food. Bento boxes were priced well. Tempura was perfect. Not too much batter. I found myself to be quite full, but complimentary ice cream would of been the cherry on top."}
{"text":"Okay.  The bottom line is this is a live flounder sashimi restaurant run by Koreans.  In this category it is one of the best I have had the pleasure of dining in in Canada.  It can be quite loud and busy so be prepared to wait.  I am not sure if they take reservations.  The staff is attentive and the prices are very reasonable.  The portions and sides are substantial so I would suggest the smallest flounder combo for 2."}
{"text":"My opinion of Gal's has changed significantly since my last visit in December 2014.  

The side dishes of noodles and potatoes were still as tasty as ever but the miso soup was so so so so so so so so sosososososososossososo salty.

My K11 (marinated beef with rice in a stone pot) was pure NaCl. It was what you would usually expect from this dish but imagine the flavour condensed.  It was overpowering even when paired with the rice.  

My boyfriend enjoyed his gamjatang with his usual nod but IMO it was a little burnt?

We also ordered the A30 - 30 pcs assorted rolls.  One roll was a spicy salmon which was okay, and the other 2 had a lobster/crab filling which honestly tasted like mush :( everything else in the order was up to par even though not brag worthy. 
Look at the pictures that accompanies it, it comes out exactly the way it looks. 

The sashimi in SA1 was not worth it as it wasn't as fresh as expected.  The quality was similar to that of Sushi on Highway 7 and not worthy of a la carte prices.  

They do however give you a yakult-like bottle at the end for dessert :) 

The restaurant is clean and also very popular on weekends.  The service is prompt as they give you a ding-dong button that alerts the waitresses you need something.

I won't be coming back for a while as there are better Korean restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Go-noe further for fresh seafood and octopus!

After having raw octopus in Beijing, I had a mad craving for some in Toronto. I heard from friends that this is one of the places to get good fresh seafood so I had to visit. 

I went with five other friends to the restaurant and got seated in a booth and the restaurant decor is cute. 

We ordered the live fish combo and a live octopus. The combo came with soju, tempura, flounder, soup, fish, and seaweed salad. The tempura was cooked well and is one of the better ones I've had. The flounder tasted really fresh, but it kind of lacked in flavour. Adding lemon to it helped the taste, but not too much. The soup was pretty spicy, but delivered on taste. The fish was hard to split between people but the fish was delicious. The seaweed salad was pretty standard. 

But before all of that... The octopus came - still squirming. You can tell it is fresh by how much it was moving. The saucers that came with it really helped bring out the flavour. 

Craving: satisfied. 

Wallet: empty. 

Although this was great, I'd rather spend this money on other sashimi restaurants. The octopus is certainly unique, but not enough for the price. 

The cherry on top: we got green tea ice cream to round off the meal."}
{"text":"I always come here for their bento lunch specials and/or their gam ja tang :)

If you're taking your bento lunch specials to go, it comes in this organized bento container and they're lightening fast with their service.

There was one time where it only took 5 minutes from the time I ordered to the time I picked up my food to go.

It's affordable and fresh!"}
{"text":"The food here isn't bad, but it certainly is over priced. I ordered a sashimi dinner box set. And it was good but again, expensive. i could've paid a little bit more and had all you can eat. My friends inquired about the pork bone soup. Since it was more expensive for pork bone soup during dinner hours, they ask what the difference was. The answer? Just the price. How do you justify that? I mean sure you want a cheaper price during lunch to bring in clientele but if you're going to jack up the dinner price, at least add something to it. like a free can of soda or something to make it seem like you are getting added value to the added cost. just a thought."}
{"text":"Was pretty impressed with this place, as a place to get quick, affordable, and filling food. 

I went with one of their \"Bento Box combo's\" that came with 3 sets of Maki rolls ( tempura roll, spicy salmon, and crab roll), along with teriyaki chicken, and rice. As is standard in most Japanese resto's, the combo also came with a misu soup and salad. The crab and salmon rolls were surprisingly moist, almost creamy like, both soft but also fresh tasting. I liked that they gave a yogurt drink to top off the meal.

The service overall was fairly quick, but I have to mention something that did bother me quite a bit (as I'm sure it would many others as well). While I was in the bathroom, I noticed one of the kitchen staff do his \"business,\" then leave without washing his hands - nothing, not even a courtesy splash. I'm not certain whether this guy handles food or not, but it's a potential  health/hygiene issue either way. Only reason why I didn't lower my rating here, is because the server I spoke to about the issue apologized, and mentioned that she would ensure it wouldn't happen again - let's hope so. 

All that aside, I would still come back here for their combo options and speedy service."}
{"text":"It's clear I have plebeian taste in food, having just given fine sushi dining at Inatei a 3 star, while this restaurant that mixes Japanese and Korean food for good value gets a 4. 

This place had been a fixture for good take out sushi/sashimi/rolls for the longest time, and it's always been a go-to place for most people I know.  Although I don't eat sashimi, their rolls and korean dishes are pretty solid. It would generally be a 3 star for the food quality, but the 4 star is for their value - hence why this place is usually packed. There's something or everyone here!"}
{"text":"We came here specifically to try the live octopus. It may be a personal taste/texture thing but after the 4th piece of live octopus I could no longer stomach it without masking it with some other food as it was quite bland and takes quite a bit of chewing. Great customer service, their other dishes were good for what they were (sushi and sashimi) but the octopus didn't live up to the hype or $$ spent."}
{"text":"This is a staple sushi place for Markham. The fish are always fresh and sushi made to quality. Sushimi are slice at a good thickness, not too thin not too thick. Its not ayce so the quality is good. The price is decent too. They don't charge through the roof for fresh fish. And they have premium ones as well if you are willing to pay more. I would suggest this place."}
{"text":"It was kind of awful. Everything is fresh but absolutely tasteless. The flounder was cut too thick and therefore was pretty chewy. It's kind of cool to see the octopus squirming around, but it really needs to be cooked (or less alive) to get a good texture. 

Overall, quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Worse take out service I have ever had. Waited 25 fucking minutes only to find out they grouped me with the wrong goddamn order."}
{"text":"lets get serious here. you don't come for the Japanese stuff.... you come here for the sashimi flounder fish (Korean style) it comes with that salty sauce you dip it in. i don't know what it is or what its called but its thick and red and ive seen it before at Korean bbq. i think it has soy bean paste in it. its delicious and its one of those versatile sauces that can be used on many different foods. i heard they also serve the sashimi style octopus here which i will have to get next time. sashimi flounder and soju is the bomb. this place is a must if you can handle a different way of eating sashimi"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time when I worked nearby. It was our fallback, always good sushi place :) 

It's always super busy here so its a little loud but generally the service is quick and friendly and the sushi is quite good! There are way too many subpar sushi places in the GTA but this is definitely one of the better ones. The sushi is fresh, and the bento boxes are all delicious and the perfect size. 

I also really like the little red bean dessert they give us at the end of the meal and I always want to just order more of them. The only downside is how busy it is as its so hard to get parking around here! Aside from that, if I was still nearby I would come all the time, now I just drop by when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"They have such a huge selection of sushi and Korean food! For lunch, they offer great bento box deals for $8.99. Most recently I got the sashimi, sushi and roll box which IMO is the best deal, it has 6 pieces of each, and Korean glass noodles, salad and soup. It left me super full and satisfied ! A few of my friends tried their korean stews which they also really liked. The service is ok. Nothing much to complain about, but they don't really go above and beyond. The space is very large making it easy to get a seat if you come during peak hours or with a large group of friends!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi restaurants. Everything is always fresh and good quality, the prices are very reasonable for what you get. The servers are always friendly and polite as well. 

I recommend getting the sushi platters as they allow you to try a large variety of different types and the value is worth it."}
{"text":"Really more like 3.5 stars.
Gals sushi is reasonably priced for what you get.  They have an extensive menu of both Japanese and Korean food.  Their sushi and sashimi is fresh and well made and very well priced.  If you get a platter or boat you can ask to change out fish that you don't like, however, be prepared to get not so great cuts of your replacement fish.  We asked to change out the white tuna for some more salmon and got the end pieces of the salmon.  Their Korean soups are very flavourful and pretty authentic, although their pork bone soup is hit and miss.  I've had really good pork bone soup there, but also times where the soup tasted like the instant noodle powder was poured into it.  Overall, Gals is a great place to get a good meal and value for the money you spend."}
{"text":"The last time I came here I was not impressed, but it has been awhile so thought I would give it another chance. It really has not changed much. We ordered a sashimi plate and soft shell crab roll. Portions were decent and presentation was not bad but the quality of the food is just not there. The sashimi did not taste fresh and the spider roll was quite salty and didn't have much other flavour. Maybe this restaurant is good for the lunch options as they seem to be good value, but I don't think I will be back for dinner."}
{"text":"First time here today, the $13.95 multi course lunch special. Sea products were fresh and the sides were nice. Excellent value and I have a big appetite ! Will return for sure when in the area. Friendly and youthful servers."}
{"text":"3.5 Star

I am amazed!!! In a couple of weeks ago, I saw this sketchy Vietnamese Pho joint closed down... and now it has transformed itself into a swanky and chic Japanese bistro.

Gonoe Japanese Bistro just opened 2 days ago.... everything brand new..... you can almost smell the fresh paint and even they still doing some touch up here and there when I was here.

2 full page of lunch specials.... from sushi, udon and bento boxes. And of course I am going for the sushi.

Sushi Lunch ($10)
- was nicely presented with 8 Nigiri and California Roll
- Fish though fresh was really thinly sliced but with the selections was good
- Shari rice was well balanced and with good bite

Services was good though servers not really sure about a lot of things but they are trying. Nice Young Korean men dressed in black... :P"}
{"text":"This review is based on takeout Party Tray Order.

Highly recommend their party tray of mix sashimi, sushi and sashimi. Price is compatible to other takeout in smaller Japanese restaurants but the quality, selection and even quantity is much better.

10% on cash order and 1 day pre order over $30 comes with complimentary salad.

Now this is going to be the take out place if I having a party or want to have a tray of sushi all for myself."}
{"text":"My fam is really more of an AYCE sushi kind of fam, so when i got a chance to join my boyfriend's family at Gonoe, I had to do it!
Everything they serve is amazingly fresh - live octopus (STILL ALIVE WHEN CONSUMED), sashimi, it's all amazing. I know there are adventurous foodies out there who have been itching to try live octopus, and you can do it right here! 
However, that's not the only thing to rave about here.. so I'm not quite sure what we ordered but i do know that its a series of combos. Just gonna name my favourite things:
Tempura - simple, but fried to be extra crispy
Spicy Fish Soup served with Black Glutinous Rice - spicy but AMAZING. just so good. reconsidering all those times that i ate pork bone soup instead..
Deep Fried Mackerel - Tasted so fresh, it's a small fish to share for a large group, but definitely worth trying.
Sushi Boat - some of the freshest seafood i've had, but then again i mostly just have AYCE sushi quality sashimi. 
Flounder Sashimi - it's a LARGE plate of sashimi, with something like chewy, jelly textured noodles underneath, served with House made ginger. it's a must try for sure

if you want fresh, authentic Japanese (but run by Koreans) food, then look no further!
(also pricing is about the same as an AYCE sushi place)"}
{"text":"I love Gals sushi, it is very reasonably priced and has so many options available for anyone. There a considerable amount of non-sushi options for those that might not be in the mood for fish.

The fish is fresh and is one of the better sushi places on the lower range in terms of pricing. If you go on the weekend it is usually pretty full so it would be a good idea to make a reservation. The lunch special is a very good price, but the dinner bento boxed are much more expensive at $22 each.

I recently went on a Monday night and it was very easy to get a table. I ordered a sushi set for $17 which had 16 pieces of sushi. The sushi had random selection of fish, but I was given very generous cuts of fish. My plate had uni, red tuna, seared white tuna, and even scallops. The types of sushi I got were definitely more premium than the ones I was expecting from the menu. All the large sushi platters are very cost efficient and always leaves me and my family full.

They can also substitute white rice for brown rice for $1 a roll if this is something that appeals to you. If there is anything you don't like on the sushi platters, they are usually very accommodating. I have changed spicy salmon rolls (not my favourite) for more California rolls many a time."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of trying new things, come to Gonoe Japanese Sushi. Firstly, you have to make sure that you are going to the right \"Gonoe\" restaurant because this is the only Gonoe restaurant that sells live octopus. And this is the one reason my friend and I came here.

A plate of live octopus tentacles cost around $37 per plate and when I mean LIVE octopus, I mean, they are still wiggling around your plate (headless). Ive seen couple videos from Instagram and I thought why not give it a try. But you gotta tag a friend along with you who is also a daredevil.

The overall service was okay and I highly recommend you to reserve a seat a head of time, especially on weekends dinner. The taste was okay, but it was a fun overall dining experience."}
{"text":"The place is very busy during lunch. Good value for price. Good lunch specials available."}
{"text":"Just had their lunch sushi bento box today.  It included about 8 pieces of sushi, 6 roll pieces, noodles, miso soup and a salad.  Pretty typical for the sushi specials in markham.  For under $10, it's a decent deal.  As someone who likes prompt service, it's great to have a buzzer option to call the waitress. Even without this option, they are generally attentive.  

I'd have to rate the quality as decent for the price- after all I keep eating and eating here (4-5 times in past 4 months)..."}
{"text":"I came here only for the convenience. But if you have the time I'd go to a different Japanese restaurant.
I really enjoy their lunch boxes because I feel they have a good variety for the value. It's around 9-15 dollars per bento. They include miso soup and salad. A lot of plates are cracked from beginning to end which is a bit concerning because it's hard to clean. 

The waiters are a bit slow and seem to have a really bad attitude, never smiling, ignoring you, but good thing they have the button on the side of the table so you can click it to get their attention. It took 5 minutes for them to finally get us the menu in the beginning. Food came out really fast which is good. In the bento, note it doesn't have a lot of rice and the portions compared to the pictures are quite off. It gets really busy during lunch time (around noon), i would recommend coming a little earlier than that."}
{"text":"This is my one of my favourite sushi spots and I probably come here every other week. It's a bit out of the way but I think the value and quality is worth it. They have a variety of lunch combos that are available even on weekends which makes it a great lunch before any weekend plans. They have a specific lunch set that is $15 that comes with sushi, maki rolls, and sashimi, AND tempura AND udon. That alone is a crazy value for the quality and variety. On top of that, they also give you about 4 side dishes, along with the standard miso soup and salad, and ending with a dessert. It's usually too much food for one person (but not enough for two) so we order another bento box on the side to fill two people up. Sometimes they might give you a cooked salmon fish head on the house if you're lucky! About $30ish total with tax and tips included for a weekend sushi lunch. Pretty good."}
{"text":"Sushi, Korean Foods, sooo good. I needed to go twice because it was so good and very much comfort food or me. And it was just next to the hotel!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and I love their sashimi and sushi -delectably fresh with wonderful (almost blissful) seafood sweetness, and the texture another sweet surrender.  No miss in having any fishy after-taste.
 
I'm so close to giving them 4 stars (for a fine dining Japanese restaurant) but the setbacks would be the mediocre rolls and, I may have been too hungry but, the amount of rice in the sushi was noticeably too little.  The menu looks satisfying yet, should I say, humdrum.   

Overall, I`m not too impressed but I would go for another visit as friends who`ve been here say some good stuff about the other items.  

The Asian transitional classic interior and ambient lighting makes this big place a lovely and intimate venue for groups and families with young kids, without undermining romantic dates.  

Gotta try that sushi bar - its is really inviting for another visit.  Service was excellent: quick, nice, and friendly; frequently checking on us and always just-in-time for our requests.  

If you`re looking for good food and a pretty impressive venue, you can add this to your list.  ;)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi spots.  They serve salad, soup, japchae (yum!) and potatoes before your food so it's a pretty good value."}
{"text":"I've only ever done takeout for lunch from Gals. Lunch special is from 11:30 to 3pm. Its a big plate of diff sushis and noodles depending on the plate you choose. 

Love the variety and amount for a small price of 10$. And you save 15% if you pay cash."}
{"text":"I really do think this place is overpriced and charge more for dinner menu of the same item for no reason at all.
Most places charge more for dinner but will give larger portion or something extra but not here.
When one of my friend ask what was the difference between lunch and dinner.
The waitress simply reply it just the price.

Will not visit again!"}
{"text":"Gal's sushi is a great place for groups of people to relax and enjoy high quality foods. With a diverse menu selection and a comfortable atmosphere, I would argue that gal's is the best option of the block."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?

You've had sushi numerous times at sushi restaurants so if you come here, don't settle for the sushi..go for the live octopus experience! Served as live octopus sashimi, you can get a plate to see the tentacles  move around in your mouth before it ultimately settles in you stomach. The flounder is also a must try. Fresh sashimi flounder is chewy but really really fresh to the point the sashimi slice comes out transparent! Other things you can try are sea squirts, abalone, gaegul and sea cucumber!! Quite an interesting eating experience right here in Toronto!

LAST TIP?

Come with a brave heart and a mind to try new things because this type of sashimi is not for everyone if you are squimish!!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and great service. You receive a complimentary miso soup and salad. A lot of options on the menu that I look forward to trying more of. I recommend this place for sushi dining."}
{"text":"Decided to try out Gals' Sushi because of it's proximity to the Markham Theatre and the positive reviews it has received on Yelp. I can say that we were not disappointed.

The menu is a nice fusion of Japanese and Korean foods. I went with one of the sushi combos that includes bulgogi. Everything was done well. The food is a great value for the price. In true Korean style the start you off with a variety of side dishes which were excellent as well. 

My only complaint is that the servers could be a little more attentive. We did see or hear from our server for quite some time."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner, group of four; we shared A8 (72 pieces of assorted sashimi, sushi, and rolls) and a couple of spicy salmon hand rolls. Sashimi was just ok; it wasn't as fresh as some other places; some of the pieces tasted too \"fishy\" for my liking (fresh sashimi shouldn't taste fishy). They don't allow substitutions for the trays which kinda sucks if you don't like a particular rolls or pieces.
I did enjoy the hand rolls; well flavoured and decent amount of salmon. 

Price is as par with other sushi places, neither cheap nor expensive. They serve Korean and Japanese and offer quite a good selections on menu so it's good for a group (everyone can get something they like). They provide complimentary green salad, miso soup, and Korean side dishes (glass noodles and potatoes). Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"One of my pet peeves is when a restaurant doesn't honor their hours of operation. My boyfriend and I came at 10pm after our movie on a Sunday with much enthusiasm because we were in the area where many restaurants had already closed. Since they open until 10:30pm, we wanted to grab a quick dinner but they told us that they weren't taking any more customers.

We could understand that it would be annoying to accommodate within the half hour in case we stayed longer than 10:30. So we asked if we could get takeout since we had made the trip. They said the kitchen was already closed.

If the kitchen closes at 10pm, you should adjust your restaurant hours accordingly to reflect that."}
{"text":"Come here for birthday dinner, looking for Uni, no Uni, they didn't offer compensation or similar replacement until we ask. Waiter shows us \"do not care\" attitude. For sure, I won't come back !"}
{"text":"This is one of my fav places for sushi and sashimi because of their combo sets because you get quite the variety of fish and seafood offerings. We ordered their Gal's Best Combo sets and a seullungtang (beef bone broth with glass noodles) and it was all perfect. The combo set had sushi and sashimi and we could use the rice that came with the beef broth to make on our spoons a personal sushi bite with the slices of sashimi. Absolute yum. Definitely recommend the place!"}
{"text":"Gals sushi had a special place in heart because it's where M and I had our first date!! The quality of the food is good and consistent. They offer you little Japanese tapas which is great! They usually consist of some potato slices with a sweet sauce and glass noodles. 
They have a door bell looking button at each table that you can ring when you need to order more, have more drinks or want to collect your bill which makes things a lot easier than trying to flag down your server."}
{"text":"After having lunch at Gal's today I was not too happy with my experience. Though I was there with a large group the service seemed really slow. We clicked the button which they have to bring a server over but after a few attempts and about 10-15 minutes nobody came. After, we just asked for water for our table and that never came as well. Overall could've been better. Food was decent but not comparable to many other places in Markham (did not try the Korean food)"}
{"text":": Gal Sushi
: Bento Box L5
: Definitely recommend going during the lunch special, the portions are huge and are cheap considering the food quality. This is my go to order, it has a mixture of beef and sushi to switch it up. 
: Large portion size and comes with soup and salad
: $12.99
: 8/10"}
{"text":"It's been a bit disappointing since the change in management, however it is still my go-to place for a nice sushi dinner. The flounder dinner is always good, though they cheap out of the condiments and we always have to ask for more. Their sashimi assortment is good and pretty fresh for Toronto standards. I suggest coming for lunch, their special is quite filling and worth the price."}
{"text":"It breaks my heart to leave such a poor review, but I feel it is my moral duty.
Yes, walking in, there was a cool, hip vibe with the lights down low and a rad sushi bar on the side. The restaurant is clean and the temperature is perfectemundo.
So, why Joey, why do you put down such a crappy review for such a classy joint??
The food prices have jumped a considerable amount, and the portions aren't as big as other Korean-Japanese fusion eateries. I ordered a Dukbaegi Bulgogi but there was only about a half tablespoon of beef in my bowl. I asked the waitress what was up, and she sent it back to me with a full tablespoon of beef. (Which was still sad.) Aside from the hiked prices and sad portions, my waitress was ridiculously rude to my parents.
This was my 3rd or 4th time in the restaurant, but I doubt I'll give it another go.
Thanks for the memories, even if they weren't so great."}
{"text":"Went here with a couple of friends for a late lunch after aborting the trip to another restaurant that was west of 7 and 404 when the traffic was insanely slow

Considering it was 1:30pm, the place was still pretty packed.  That's usually a good sign.

Looking through the menu I can feel my wallet thinning away already.  The prices were a bit on the higher end.

My friends were hungry so they ordered the kalbi and Soon Tofu while I waited for the $50 sashimi platter (which was the cheapest party tray they had with the most pieces)

Since this was a Korean place as well we did get some appetizers, though it was good it was just two: sweet potatoes (yum) and some other thing which I didn't like as much.

Their food arrived first.  The Soon tofu looked spicy so I didn't bother trying it.  I had one piece of the kalbi.  That was enough of a turn off for me.

Eventually the main event came and a big tray of sashimi had arrived.

All I can say was yum overall.

They had (in order from dislike to like):
* shrimp heads uncooked, didn't bother.  They need to deep fry this sucker before I'd eat it.

* semi-cooked butter fish, didn't like that one too much.  Left my mouth feeling a bit icky.

* Something wrapped in squid.  Though I never liked squid sashimi, this was actually quite good.

* Surf clam / Octopus / Red Snapper (run of the mill)

* Variety of RED tuna (not that white crap) tasty

* Shrimp sashimi ooh.

* Variety of salmon parts.  Though my friend didn't like to eat it because it wasn't \"cleaned\" properly, personally I liked the inner skin of the salmon as it gives it a bit of a real fish taste.

* mackarel with roe attached to it, never had it like that before and it was yummy yummy.

* finally they had what could be the equivalent of ootoro in salmon form.  My friend also says they normally though this part out, but oh man it was sooooo good.  It was very fatty and buttery feel in my mouth.  I put the thing in my mouth, bite, let the flavor waft inside, savor, repeat.

Something that tastes that good is likely bad for me but I don't care :)

I would come here again, even though it's significantly pricey."}
{"text":"Called in before I headed out to ask when was last call.  First the girl had no idea and asked the other staff and after discussing she said 10:30pm. We made it before 10:30pm after a 30 minute commute and the waitress said the chef had already left. They were not apologetic at all and just said well there's no chef to make the food for you. Was definitely a disappointment since it use to be my late night sushi spot."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi.  They have large slices of sashimi and fresh live octopus.  All delicious! Don't be afraid of trying the live octopus. Dip it in the sauce they provide and it tastes excellent.  Staff were friendly.  They gave us complimentary appetizers as apology for the wait for our main courses but really we didn't think it took that long.  Nevertheless we appreciated their thoughtfulness!  This will be my go to for sushi in the North York area."}
{"text":"First it was great, then it got not so great, and now they are back on my list of good places to get food.

During the transition from Gonoe to Gal's, they kind of pushed my buttons all over the place.  Their little extra charges, the excessive wait for service, the substitution for items that were not conveyed to me...really took them down in my books.

I left for a bit and have been steadily coming back again.  I've been to a lot of other places over the past little while but when it comes to good sushi and generous cut sashimi, this place is still one of the best.

Also, the fish isn't the only thing that is good here.  The Korean fare of stews and beef are superior to many other non-sushi restaurants.  My friends go here to get the burgolgi dishes and tempura.  I usually stick to my sushi/sashimi combos.

The sashimi continues to be extra fresh.  The presentation and knife work is better than most Korean sushi joints.  The portions are great and appropriate for the price they charge.  They continue to be busy - not as busy as years past.

The service which was lacking during the transition has greatly improved and once again, this place is my go to place for good sushi.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now. First time was great the second was kinda mediocre.  

I noticed people either love love love this place or think it's just meh. From what I had, they are both right!

I ordered the same things both times.

Both times tempura app was over fried. Everything was dried out and weirdly hard and mushy. . Not the fluffy coating and crispy vegetables.  So I have to say, pass on tempura.

I got the sushi tray. Sa1 I think.   First time fresh bursting with flavour, vibrant coloured fish. This meal was earlier dinner on a Monday.

Next time was later on a Saturday. Dull courses fish, tasted not as new and tasted more fishy. 

So. I guess it depends when you go. 
I'll be back but beindful what day and time I visit. 

Ill update my review to reflect it. For now. It's a solid three. Average for a 4 and a 2 star meal.

Oh yeah parking sucks. Get someone else to drive."}
{"text":"Horrible service . Dumb hostess. Hostess told us if we want to wait then wait, if not then leave. Wtf! What kinda service is this."}
{"text":"Small place, service is only adequate... 

They have pretty good sashimi and sushi, as well as large portions for dinner combos. Unfortunately the prices are so high!! And the food wasn't amazing, tasted pretty regular.

I ordered the Chirashi $16.95, generous small chunks of sashimi and rice. My boyfriend's Zaru Soba (cold soba noodles) was pretty tasteless even with the sauce...

****But here's why it's worth coming here!****

Flounder sashimi (hirame) - yaaaa knowww, the flat fish with eyes on top!? Remember in Finding Nemo, the little fish kids were hiding behind it and the flounder was like, \"Where'd you go where'd you go where'd you go\"

Sannakji (or san nak ji) - MOVING octopus tentacles, with sesame sauce

The sannakji is definitely as you'd image (if you've had octopus or squid sashimi before), but Gonoe drenches it in A LOT of sesame sauce. I could hardly taste the octopus! 

But the suction cups? STILL WORKIN'! 

$25 for that, eh? ;) It also isn't on the menu, you'd have to ask them for it!"}
{"text":"Just finished having lunch here, and as usual it was great! For the price you pay... Definitely worth it! Husband ordered the sushi bento box for 10.99 and I got the chicken and tempura box for 12.99... Thoroughly enjoyed! Check out my pic... I think for the price u pay and the amount of food u get this resto earns a 4star. I cant speak for dinner however as we only come here for the sushi lunch special.. May be a different experience. Lunch is from 11:30 - 3. Overall would recommend and continue to come here for lunch!"}
