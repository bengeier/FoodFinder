{"text":"Stopped by Maryanne's for breakfast. Our waitress was friendly and witty. Ordered the 3 egg, sausage, toast and hash browns. Comes with free coffee or tea. Yum. You will get a lot of food for a little price. Everything was served  fresh and hot. My eggs were cooked perfect and the hash browns were crispy.  The cost of three full breakfasts was $22 and change. I will return next time I'm in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"I adore these little out of the way places that most people never realize exist.  According to our waitress, Maryanne's has been in business for 30 years.  It seems implausible considering that I grew up a few towns over and had never known of its existence until yesterday.

Primarily a restaurant serving area truckers (and there are a ton, considering Stowe Twp. is Pittburgh's industrial mecca), this place is as hometown blue collar 'Burgh as you can get.  That's what I loved so much about Maryanne's.  The food is simple breakfast/lunch fare.  Typical breakfast options (eggs, meats, toast, waffles, french toast, omelettes, and potatoes), but in ginormous portions!  A whole back menu of breakfast and lunch hoagies.  Our waitress, Evelyn, informed us that the place is packed with truckers and day laborers in the morning. They get their MASSIVE hoagies and eat half, saving the rest for lunch.  After seeing these hoagies (of which I had a hard time even eating half), I completely understand.  Btw, the hoagie was tasty, fresh, and on Mancini's bread... yum!

Other than that, this place is set up like a truck stop out west - with a Pittsburgh flair of course.  Little gnomes, fountains, decorative brick-a-brack, random benches and outdoor seating, etc.  The bathroom is around the side, but it's not an \"outhouse\"; Clean too!  Our waitress looked like a trucker herself, and had a gruff friendly demeanor.  She was awesome!  The coffee is serve yourself and the homemade iced tea comes in a giant pitcher which is left at the table.  You'll see lots of local color.  Oh, and it's cash only.

Go here!  Immerse yourself in the culture of Pittsburgh.  And, get some really tasty eats!"}
{"text":"Wow was this place great. Feels like your eating at grandma's house. Great workers there, cash only. Small spot. Breakfast and lunch only. I got the hamburger and it was HUGE and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Friendly family style service.  Everyone there was very friendly, helpful and talkative.  Serve yourself coffee which always ensures that you have enough and an omelet that could feed an army!  Only advice is skip the hasbrowns.  But don't skip this place!"}
{"text":"service was awful, ask for cream and waitress said it is self service.. no other customers in place. poor service."}
{"text":"By far the BEST Italian hoagie I have ever had. I would probably eat here every day if I could. The place has a super cute homie feel too which is nice. Love this place"}
