{"text":"AMAZING!  Best Lebanese food in Charlotte. The spices are right on ,and prices are fantastic!  Coming from Detroit, we've been missing authentic Arabic food. Trust me when I say that this is gonna be your favorite Mediterranean joint in the queen city. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Food really good fresh and seasoned well. Great prices for lunch. I've been 3 days  straight for lunch"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Dowtown Matthews. Wonderful authentic Mediterranean dishes! Hummus is the best around. Lebanese salad is a tasty treat. Entrees are generous and tasty.   Staff is friendly and welcoming. Great for a date night or to bring the family."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places ! Always more than enough food that is fresh and well prepared !"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. The kufta was dry and the chicken tasted reheated. The rice was really good and the vegetables tasted like they went bad. The kabobs were pretty good according to hubby I thought the meats were over done and the chicken was dry and hard."}
{"text":"Wow, what an experience.   Let me first say that a meal here is a feast. I was amazed at the portions sizes. We tried the Pita Sampler #2 appetizer , and it along with the entree side of Lebanese Salad (which is the size of a meal salad) could have easily satisfied us. So we had to save a good portion of it to make room for our entrees. The hummus and Baba Gonousch were amazing, and the pita was fresh from the oven, they looked like bread  pillows inflated with hot air!  I had the beef shawarma, which had a heaping mound of moist beef and lamb, with grilled veggies and light and moist yellow rice. Terrific. My wife had the mixed grill, kebabs of chicken, lamb, kafka. Delicious.   Everything is super fresh and made in house only. Sam, the owner came over to meet us and checked in a couple times to make sure we had everything and liked everything. The wait staff was super attentive and friendly and helpful.   The bad news is we could not come close to eating it all, and the good news is that we didn't eat it all, because I'm looking forward to having it again tonight!  Great fresh and healthy food, prepared with pride and served by very nice folks. One of the best overall restaurant values I've experienced, period."}
{"text":"Excellent and fast service! Everyone there was very friendly and even though it was a weekend night we didn't have to wait long. The food was delicious."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  The best Mediterranean I've had in Charlotte. The portions are huge and the price is just perfect. The ambiance wasn't something to be desired because there were lots of families with loud children and the bathrooms weren't the classiest I've ever seen BUT the food more than made up for these small shortcomings!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Lots of options for those who are gluten free. I had the Greek salad with beef as an add on and it was delicious for a late lunch. Be prepared, the portions are huge. I came with four other people who ordered different dishes and everyone was happy with their meals. I sampled from each person and loved the food. The side salads are really good, too. The sauces are yummy."}
{"text":"Decided to visit this place after reading multiple positive reviews about the food. Ordered chicken shawarma and it was the worst one i ever had. First of all chicken shawarma is never made with just white meat, it has a combination of white and dark meat to avoid dryness and add flavor. The shawarma had big chunks of white meat, pickle and loads of garlic spread thats it. It was missing many things including flavor, will not be returning because their are other places in charlotte that serve better flavored shawarma."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant ever!! I always order the Fatoush salad with half chicken half lamb shawarma and eat it with pita bread. Cost only $10 and have left overs for days! highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I stopped in for take-out and was super please with the friendly and prompt service I received. I ordered the Greek salad, Hummus and spicy potatoes. The portions were huge - enough for two people to share each item. It came with a big bag of soft fluffy pita for scooping and dipping. The hummus was spot on delicious. Smooth and creamy. It isn't like that grainy grocery store hummus - yuck! The potatoes were fresh and just the right amount of spice and the salad was beautiful to look at and full of flavor. The space isn't fancy, but it is comfortable and clean. I would absolutely recommend it for anyone who frequents Kabob Grill on East Blvd. or the old Kabob Grill on Rea Road - it's really good clean food."}
{"text":"Great food and service.we had the hummus baba ganush grape leaves and mahadra and everything was awesome.I love Mediterranean food and this is the best I've had."}
{"text":"Pita kabab is the best restaurant in  Matthew. we had dinner me and my wife tonight. it was very delicious. I would like from everybody to go and try it ."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and the falafel sandwich was good but I thought the meat in my boyfriends lamb dish was dry and chewy for my taste but he seemed to enjoy it. Service just average not especially friendly. I might return for the falafel.... maybe. I don't know though, if I don't feel welcomed I usually don't go back."}
{"text":"Went there and had some good authentic Mediterranean food. Prices are super cheap especially for the quantity of food that they serve. Keep up the good work and the low prices Pita Kabob!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch spot. We love to do takeaway from here. Their food is plentiful but flavorful! Try the shawarma fattoush salad and baba ghanoush."}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful.  They had the best falafel that I've ever eaten! The kafta kabob was very flavorful. I can't wait to go back to try their lamb. They had the typical Middle Eastern desserts like baklava but they also had a rice pudding that was to die for! I would rate this as the best Middle Eastern restaurant in the Charlotte area. This will definitely become one of my go to restaurants."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service:) We couldn't have better lunch! Just watch out for the portions because they're really big :)"}
{"text":"Amazing! Such great flavors. Very helpful waitstaff.  Tried the sujok for the first time, and was pleasantly surprised. It was one of my favorite dishes I ate yoday. Love this place, and will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!  Food is delicious, authentic and the portions are enormous. Server was pleasant and was knowledgeable about the menu.  When we asked for recommendations..she provided the perfect options. The lentil soup was savory,  the kebabs were juicy and perfectly marinated, chicken Sharwma was so yummy and the appetizer plate - Baba Ganoush, hummus and Tabouleh was outstanding.  I do not give five stars often,  but eating here brought me back to the days when I lived in San Francisco and the food was always a flavorful, worldly experience."}
{"text":"What an I say.. the food is awesome always fresh and crisp..   Having lived overseas with the U.S military I came home craving some authentic Shawrma .. Pita Kebab hits the spot!  Kudos"}
{"text":"Good lebanese and arabic food with a great service. You should try the chicken shawrma the taste is just right.  They also serve hookah try the blue mist I like it."}
{"text":"This is a little hidden gem that I think needs to be shared. Our lunch bunch tried this establishment today and boy we're we treated like royalty! We weren't very sure about the menu, we've never had authentic Lebanese cuisine. Out of this world! I had the Greek salad with shawarma ( cooked beef pieces). I was not expecting what I got at all! It was a huge salad with a large portion of meat on top. They also brought out tahini sauce for use to try, and must admit I actually liked it better than tahziki sauce even though I love cucumbers! Our friend that suggested the place ordered a hummus for us all to share and they brought out all the pita we could eat. Now this is not the same pita you get at say showmars, this was puffy and very soft and waaaaaaarrrrrmmm! Excellent! I'm a hummus lover now!! The owner came to speak with us twice and was very sincere, explaining his recipes with us and how healthy Lebanese food really is. BONUS!! Some of the ladies got the kabobs and everyone was pleased. My only advice I'd like to leave with you is, if you order the shrimp kabob, be prepared it's very spicy. I would enjoy that but it's not for everyone. The ambiance is authentic and like I said, we were treated very well! This is a five for me!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious food, fair price and nice place. My family and I were very satisfied after our first visit. Definitely, we will come again and we will recommend this restaurant to our friends."}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough, super delicious food and authentic cuisine very clean resturant and super friendly staff..on my favorite restaurant list from now .. Highly recommended ..nothing but five stars"}
{"text":"Yum!   We were very excited for this place to open because there aren't a ton of options in our area, and Mediterranean food is a new taste for the area.   We went on a Wednesday night for dinner. There were a lot of cars in the parking lot, but we were promptly seated. We ordered the baba ganoush for an appetizer. It was delicious and huge. Entrees were similarly generous in size.   The owner, Sam, recommended the lamb shank with saffron rice to my husband. I had the beef kofta. Entrees come with a salad or soup. The salad dressing was great, and their homemade pita is fantastic.   We took half our meals home because they were so big, and leftovers the next day were amazing.   Very friendly service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Wow. Do not miss this place. Best Mediterranean food not only in Charlotte but perhaps in the country. Huge portions. Everything fresh. And the best service I have ever had in any restaurant. Ask for Saja!!"}
{"text":"How does this place have 4.5 stars? Deserves 1 star just to bring this place back to reality. Average food and the worst service I've experienced in quite a while."}
{"text":"The 3-star rating is for the food alone. The portions are huge and the flavors are good. My husband and I ordered the vegetarian sampler as an appetizer, and we were unable to touch our mains. We were completely full.   The service was horrible. I know the guy was trying, but it was bad. We asked for waters four times. We were happy to have ordered the appetizer when we ordered drinks, because the kitchen was incredibly slow. Our mains came out at different times, and my husband's sandwich arrived at the table after we asked for the check. We asked for to-go containers and waited for at least 10 minutes for those."}
{"text":"Went and ate here today so I'm going to make this short and sweet serves sucks food was dryer than sand the best thing on my table was the rice"}
{"text":"I stopped in and ordered a to-go order, which took a bit longer than I anticipated: 20 mins from time I paid until I was leaving with it. Major kudos to them for the perfectly packed to-go order!!!! Wanting to sample several items, I ordered Fattoush salad w/beef shawarma, Cabbage salad, and Foul Mudammas. Since some restaurants typically add more dressing than I care for, I've learned to request it on the side. All of this came with pita bread, and again - was perfectly packed.  Fattoush w/beef shawarma was tasty, but only while the beef was still warm. Lesson learned: either share that salad, or order with chicken. A leftover salad with cold beef isn't exactly good.   Their cabbage salad with tomatoes isn't what I expected. The purple and green cabbage wasn't shredded thin (like a certain Greek restaurant does) but rather thicker shreds. Also,a few pieces of the core had slipped in there. The dressing for it was good, though.  My favorite was the Foul Mudammas, which was excellent.  Oh, I'm going back - but this time it will be for their Greek salad with chicken."}
{"text":"Still awful a year later. Both our meals starred beef which was wanting to be made into army boots. My wife couldn't finish hers it was burned and fatty. Mine was just tough and tasteless.This place must have a way to bury negative reviews. Next time I'll try the water."}
{"text":"Always great service and great food! Best tabouli I have ever had!!! Also recommend the mixed pickle appetizer!! So yummy!"}
{"text":"Situated right next to the post office, this is a hidden gem!  Wow, amazing food.  Stopped by expecting to get take-out quality food.  Nope, it was 5-star restaurant heaven.   We got the appetizer sampler as well as 2 entrees.  We had enough food for 5 people and happily took a bunch home.   Simply amazing, and the staff was great too!"}
{"text":"I had the LAMB KABAB with rice and it was excellent. Very tender and lots of veggies... enough to take leftovers home...I will be go back!"}
{"text":"This is my first time having Mediterranean food and after hearing other people Rave about this place I made sure that it was on my calendar in May.   The atmosphere is enhanced by some different colored light features that add to the ambiance and the dining room is broken into sections so each little area feels cozy and complete.   Our server was amazing at explaining what the different items on the menu were and even brought us two samples of the chicken shwarma (sp?) vs. the meat one to help us decide what to order for dinner. The samples were really generous and the tahini sauce for the meat plus the garlic sauce for the chicken was incredible.   We ended up choosing to appetizers and splitting an entree. The hummus on the appetizer menu is to die for and the pita bread they serve with it is absolutely heavenly. Then there is the fried cauliflower that has yet another amazing sauce that we devoured instantly.  For the entree we ended up choosing the meat Kabob sampler platter which came with two sides. Since we were sharing we decided to do two side salads which were large and fresh with a light citrus dressing. (It's almost crazy that the salads were my least favorite thing but I think it's just because everything else was so darned? good.)  The sampler platter featured some lamb and some chicken and some kafta kebabs. Kafta is ground beef and lamb mixed together to make meatballs and it was my least favorite of the three choices. They brought out the same delicious garlic sauce (that's based on egg whites) for us to dip the chicken in and (bc it was her fav sauce) our waitress Star also brought out a bowl of a red tomato based sauce that paired exquisitely with the lamb kabob.  At the close of our meal we were convinced we could not eat another bite and the owner Sam stop by our cable and insisted we try his favorite dessert which was his baklava. He presented us with a piece of Walnut and pistachio baklava which we enjoyed very much and marveled at how such a weighty item could melt in our mouths so fast and feel so light!  I cannot wait to bring my parents here and my kids as well as I am convinced that they will be fast fans of Sam's Lebanese-styled Mediterranean recipes as soon as they try one bite."}
{"text":"This building in Matthews (by the post office) has been several Mexican restaurants over the past several years, and now it's a Middle Eastern/Mediterranean one.  While you can definitely see what was obviously a Mexican-themed exterior and interior, it works fine for this new reincarnation.  The space is much bigger and nicer inside than I originally thought, so that was a nice surprise.  To start, they bring you complimentary pita bread.  Lots of it.  There isn't really anything to put on it (unless you purchase hummus or something separately), but it has a good flavor on its own.  Or better yet, save it for use with your entree.  The menu has a variety of items from which to choose.  Since they didn't have a description (or photo), I asked our server to describe a few of them.  She didn't really know and grabbed the owner/manager who was super friendly, but looked at me like I asked him for his first born.  I just wanted to make an educated decision about my entree, that's all.  Some descriptive text and/or photos would help the newbies.  Anyway, I went with the chicken shawarma.  With the main entrees come two sides.  I opted for the side salad and rice.  The \"side\" salad was gigantic.  The dressing was fantastic.  My partner fell in love with his side (i.e., big bowl) of lentil soup and wouldn't shut up about how great it was.  So I tried it.  It was excellent, and I'm not even a huge fan of lentil soup.  Then came the entrees.  OMG.  Each plate could have fed a small village.  I ate what I could but still ended up taking home a lot of it.  The leftover chicken made two salads and the leftover rice and veggies made their own meal.  You certainly got a lot for your money.    We'll definitely return.  The food and service were both excellent, and the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Another great kabab restaurant in Matthews.  Excellent, fresh food, friendly wait staff and generous portions.  Large dinning area accommodates big parties well.  If you always go to the other one in Sycamore Commons, give this one a try."}
{"text":"Great food, good staff and great prices.  Hope thisplace stays a gem and doesnt hike up their prices and become too main stream"}
{"text":"Great food, fresh and favorable.  Service was fast and attentive.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Their food is so good!! I happened upon this restaurant looking for something different since I happened to be in the area and was so glad I picked this place. I got the Pita sampler #2 and it was enough for 2 people and everything was so flavorful and fresh tasting. I've tried two other similar restaurants closer to where I live/work and was so disappointed! I had to come back to Pita Kebab and they satisfied once again! There's someone's grandma working back there in that kitchen and I love her"}
{"text":"Waitress was very sweet and attentive. Food was delicious and plenty of it! We brought the missionaries from our church here who have never experienced Mediterranean food. They were skeptical at first, not knowing what most things were. But they left full and happy. They fully enjoyed the food.  Nothing we had disappointed, other than the mozzarella sticks (but honestly, who eats those at a place like this?! My picky daughter and skeptical missionaries. Lol) The fried cauliflower was awesome! We all had some type of kabob and none of us have a complaint. Tons of food and the seasoning perfect. The salad was good, maybe a little excessive on the amount and dressing, but it was still very good. My husband and I have been to many Mediterranean restaurants and Pita Kabob is definitely a new favorite. No doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great find. An authentic restaurant with delicious flavors and textures. The vegetarian platter is fantastic. The Baba Ghanuje is the best I have ever had anywhere. The hummus and the mahadjar were both great.  Fried cauliflower with tahini was so very good. The  servers were very attentive and personable. There was an awesome private birthday party going on while I was there, with music and dancing. This place had such a fun and comfortable atmosphere. Sam, the owner checked on me twice and then sat and talked with me, which was very nice. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went today for lunch, had the chicken soup, hummus and pita, and fried cauliflower fur appetizers. All were excellent. Had the chicken kabob platter to share. Good size servings. We will be back."}
{"text":"First Chicken Shwarma, best so far.  Good place.I found it on the run and couldn't have been more satisfied."}
{"text":"We had an amazing meal and service was excellent.  Their chef (Nasim) is the guy that made the great food at Kabob -Je and now running his own place here.  They just opened up so traffic was light, but I suspect word of mouth will make this place a success.  We are going back this weekend.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Holy Cow, If you want left overs and Great food, this is the place. If you like Hummus there truly is the best and so so fresh. It taste like they just made it before they serve it. There kabobs is so Very taste. Not the best in atmosphere but still worth it. It is kind of cold looking. But you go there for the food. The servers are very nice as well. I have been there so many times and everyone I talk to there just loves there food."}
{"text":"Ate here last night with my wife based upon reviews listed in Yelp ... could not have been more excited! Wonderful wonderful food. Waitstaff excellent. And the owner, Sam, came out to ask us how our dinner was and to chat with us a bit. Have the beef Schwarma (sp?) I over Greek salad and it was amazing enough for dinner and lunch Do check this place out. Great restaurant in Matthews mint Hill area"}
{"text":"The food was so awesome!  Best Middle Eastern food I've had in a very long time.  Spicy potatoes were superb, all the kebabs were very good.  Service was great, very welcoming.  The homemade pita is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Pita Kabob was literally empty when we went on a Monday. They could add some music or something. There was no ambiance and the place was dead. The service took awhile which was weird given the lack of clientele. When we finally ordered the food did some out fast. The lentil soup was amazing! The chicken shawarma platter was huge and delicious especially for the price. My boyfriend enjoyed his Greek salad with chicken but wished he got what I did. Hummus was good and so was pita but the pita wasn't as fresh as I am used to other places. Overall I would go back but the service and environment could use some love."}
{"text":"Wonderful!! Great food great service!! We got the hummus - best I ever had. Fried cauliflower.. Yum. For entrees we got the deboned chicken (garlic) and the kabobs we off the hook!! My 12 year-old said it was best chicken she ever had. The lentil soup was delicious, Smooth, wonderful flavor. So much food - homemade pita bread, brought lots of food home too. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Very good lunch specials. Staff is amazing and most importantly they have 2 great hot sauces. Try the cauliflower sandwich, it is to die for."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for work. I try to avoid chains and seek out local flare or something I can't get \"back home\". When I saw the chance to eat at a Mediterranean, family-owned establishment, I raced here.   Admittedly, I over ordered because I was so excited to get a \"flavor\" for what they had to offer. I got the \"pita sampler 1\" as an appetizer and the \"pita kabob mix grill\" as the main course. Much of both leaving with me in to-go boxes! The appetizer quality and portion were enough for a meal for two in itself! The humus, definitely nothing like store-bought flavors that Americans are accustomed to. The kabobs - oh man! Incredible.  Definitely worth every dollar spent!!  If you're in the mood for something different, maybe a little adventurous, do come here"}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic! Hummus was fresh, kafta kebab was perfectly seasoned, and the veggies with it were amazing too! I could have made a meal of just the pita bread. My parents had the lamb kebab & really enjoyed theirs.  Service can't be beat, we went at lunch time & were seated quickly, and service was quick & friendly.  I've been wanting to try this place for a while & I'm so glad I did-- will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were greeted by an incredibly friendly staff and seated right away. Our orders were promptly taken and we quickly received our food.  Absolutely delicious! We started with the hummus and beef shwarma and pita bread. My husband ordered the chicken kabob with the house salad and lentil soup while I opted for a chicken shwarma sandwich. My husband's kabob was moist and full of flavor, the vegetables were perfectly sautéed and the lentil soup was mouth watering. My chicken shwarma sandwich was served hot with pickles and a creamy yogurt sauce tucked into a large home made pita. The portions were so generous that we brought the majority of our meal home with us. If you are looking for a reasonable my priced Mediterranean restaurant I highly recommend Pita Kabob!"}
{"text":"The food and service were amazing. My waitress whose name escapes me (young, accent, dark hair, nice makeup) made a great suggestion of the lamb kabobs. They were so good and so filling I had the second kabob for lunch then next day. Definitely the best pitas and kabobs I've ever had. But to be fare, I've had maybe 3 in my life so take that as you will."}
{"text":"Love this place, delicious food, large portions and friendly staff. The hummus is fresh and tasty plus the kebabs are cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"We were just in the area to help my son and his family move into a new home just over 3 miles from the restaurant. I order a family size kabab special. It was said to feed four , yet the four of us and the toddler all ate well, with left overs for at least two of us to repeat the meal. I also order extra cucumber yogurt salad and taboo-lie, with baklava for four. Every thing was delicious , fresh and the freshest Pita I have had I a long time. And to my delight the meal was both authentic Mediterranean served still on the Kabab over a huge bed of rice and vegetables, also fresh and prepare and presented with care and respect for the customer.  And although this was a to go order all was fresh hot and well packed for the ride to dinner . It appeared to be a family of  brothers working hard to please. They even ran out after me with my wallet I just left behind. This place is great!!!!"}
{"text":"$13 for a huge plate of beef and chicken shawarma. Waitress Samantha was helpful. Lentil soup and Lebanese salad was tasty."}
{"text":"One of the best kabab restaurants in Charlotte. And definitely the best pita bread in Charlotte. Plus it is reasonable priced with outrageously large portions. I loved it."}
{"text":"Wow, that was incredible!  I had the chicken shwarma, my wife had the falafel pita and we shared the cauliflower appetizer.  Everything was wonderful.  The hummus was fantastic.  I couldn't decide if I wanted to put the garlic sauce or the hummus on my chicken.  The veggies were all cooked to the proper tenderness.  The service was great, our food came out quickly and at the right temp.  We will be making this a regular restaurant in our rotation for sure."}
{"text":"We tried this place based on the reviews. What we had was fair at best. Greek salad was mushy and the lamb was over cooked and tough . Nothing tasted fresh . I've had much better Greek food elsewhere. Place was close to empty too . And as Gordon Ramsey says, \" If a restaurant isn't a 98% capacity when you arrive , something is wrong. \""}
{"text":"This place the moment you walk in you are family. They were busy and I was just getting a Togo order and ever server in the place must have asked me do I need anything. It always nice to see a well managed clean establishment. From watching the dishes come out i knew I was in a for a treat. I order the chicken kebabs. It was a fest for 2 as the chicken was marinated down to the stick it was on. Plentiful vegetables full flavored rice it was more than enough.   Owner came by while I was sitting at the bar waiting for my food and asked me how I was doing and gave me a nice pat on the back like I was indeed family.   A must try if you're in the area; place has that wonderful smell of fresh seasonings that you know was cooked with love.   Will be back to try the beef kebabs next."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful helpful staff and incredible food. We had the beef kabobs and they were tender and full of flavor.  The serving was large enough to share for 2 people easily!"}
{"text":"Our party ordered a variety of plates and all of them were delicious!   I had the falafel and it was very tasty.   I also tried the chicken shwarma, hummus and kibbeh. They were all awesome!   Visit Pita Kabab near downtown Matthews.   You will love it!   The food is amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! I have been here multiple times since the grand opening and have been pleased every time.  My favorite dish is the vegetable platter; you get a little bit of everything. And, of course, their bread is awesome!! Love this place."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to write my review for this place. I get excited when I have a five star experience and can't wait to share it. Everything was great about my visit to Pita Kabab. I started out with the hummus and delicious hot pita bread, paired with a Brooklyn lager on draft. So pleased to see that they had so many beer options. I decided to go with the lamb and rice special and was glad that I did. Lamb was fall off the bone tender and the rice and onions were the perfect compliment. I really have no complaints. Owner came out to check on my meal and the waitress was friendly and attentive. If you are a fan of Mediterranean food, you've got to give Pita Kabab a try."}
{"text":"I know most of you readers won't believe my review since it is drastically different from the rest but believe I have no reason to write a false review. The owner here is very nice....his food, however is very bad. The menu is almost a mirror image as the other Lebanese restaurant here in Matthews (with a very similar name) but the food is no where near the quality. They lowered the price to appeal to the customers but it's not worth it. The staff has some training to do also. It's definitely not a well oiled machine yet.  I won't be going back. I'll be spending my money where the food is fresh and authentic.  UPDATE: I can't stand to have so many people mislead by this place. Just go to Kebab Je for your meal. The food there is 100 times better."}
{"text":"Middle Eastern restaurants come & go. As a Lebanese person, I enjoy trying new Mediterranean restaurants that open up. When I heard a new joint in downtown matthews was opening, I had to try it. I am very satisfied with their quality & service. Friendly staff & the owner is extremely welcoming. I hope this restaurant establishes itself as the premier Mediterranean spot. Get the Lamb Kabab. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Got Togo here the other day. Had the falafel sandwich it was delicious! Will definitely be returning for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"So I've been back after my first delicious lunch visit with 3-4 dishes.  This time for dinner:   Sujok Lebanese sausage.... tomatoes... lemon juice  Chicken Shawarma....  Very friendly staff and customers. Nice music. Very enjoyable.  This food is so scrumptious, seriously.  Going back asap."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. We ordered the chicken kabobs with double rice, veggies and also got the fried potatoes. The kabobs have great flavor due to the seasoning mix they use. They were not dry at all. The garlic sauce is so good! The potatoes were good as well - these had a strong lemon/garlic flavor which we liked. We will definitely be back. The only negative is the atmosphere- the interior could really use updating and when we went it was extremely hot and humid inside the restaurant. I don't think the air was on at all and they made no mention of it so not sure if this is just the norm there."}
{"text":"Fresh smoking hot pita, tasty lamb, garlic sauce that they should bottle, kebabs & lamb were absolutely fantastic!  Couple that w wonderful service & this is one of our new go to places."}
{"text":"Server was rude not only to us but also to another patron seated across from us. The food was salty!  When I asked for the yogurt sauce the server was perplexed.   Hmm!   I will never go back here again."}
{"text":"Your chance to try a variety of Middle Eastern/Mediterranean foods.  This is the real deal and fortunately you have guides available to help you choose among the many offerings.  What makes it hard is that the food is from a not-so-familiar culture to Americans.    We liked the menu as it breaks down into categories, like kabobs, shawarma, plates, pitas, etc.  Your waiter will pick up the slack and the two waiters we experienced were as friendly and helpful as you could wish for. Malek was our primary who did a great job for us.  The have a decent selection of beer and wine.  We sipped as we studied the menu.  Then we ordered a Lebanese salad which was delicious and had a very nice dressing.  Don't know what it was, but it was tasty.  We also ordered a lentil soup, expecting a little cup, but it turned out to be a bowl...a meal in itself.  And, of course, we had a basket of very fresh, warm pita bread which was soft and yeasty straight from the oven.  Wife had the Kafta Kabab which was the best choice.  Meaty and flavorful, with yellow rice.  Glad she shared.  I had the shawarma beef which was OK.  It was a huge portion of sliced beef that was somewhat dry, and it was accompanied by mixed roasted veggies.  The veggies were pretty much flavorless and coupled with the basic dry beef I did not like the meal.  My fault, not theirs.  The restaurant reminds me of a 1930s steak house with lots of large rooms and a big bar.  Very spacious, so would accommodate groups, special events and large families.  And they have some big sized special roast and baked Mediterranean specials which would be expected in the Middle East at banquets.  They can handle those here.  A fun, interesting eating experience.  Worth a try and bring a couple of couples so you can share more items among yourselves."}
{"text":"I came here after seeing in Yelp reviews that Nasim is here now!  He is a phenomenal chef.  I had the fattouche with chicken sharma and it was fabulous, very flavorful and fresh, a huge serving.  I usually don't eat the radishes in fattouche but these are chopped into matchstick shapes and they were great!  The chicken sharma was very moist and savory, not dry at all.  I had the chocolate cheesecake for dessert and it was wonderful.  The waitress was very conscientious and quick.  This building has been a lot of different restaurants since I moved to matthews in 2002 and I am very happy a restaurant has opened in this location that is here to stay! At 1pm they were still busy. Lots of seating, which is a big plus!"}
{"text":"So wish I could give this place negative stars. The food was just mediocre but the service was absolutely HORRIBLE!!!! I sat there for 15 mins with no refill on my drink and I asked for my check and had already handed the server my card and waited another 15 mins for him to bring it back to me. I called the manager over and said I had to return back to work but the manager was too busy texting on his phone. Not sure how this place got such rave reviews.    I have been in the service industry myself for many years. The restaurant wasn't even that busy. Don't worry though after I paid the bill it was no time for Alen to snatch the bill back up. I didn't want to tip him anything but left him a dollar.     Alen didn't even tell me thank you or anything when he brought the bill back. Worst service EVER. Stay away."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time last night. We tried a couple of items. We only had a short amount of time to spend. All of the items that we tried were fresh and delicious. The falafel's were yummy. We learned they make their own yogurt in house. They also make their own pickles. Staff was very friendly. We will definitely be back soon. The pita bread with some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Been twice, had the lamb sandwich the first time and the steak sandwich second time. They both had one thing in common, the same fatty, chewy, gristly meat. The other friends in my group experienced the same problem. For what it matters, the rest of the sandwich is pretty good. Unfortunately, the meat is a pretty important part of the sandwich.  The restaurant itself is pretty worn down as it has been recycled many times. The service is decent and staff are friendly but they're just too many better options nearby to try this place again. Go to Kabab Je Rotisserie near Costco instead."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I love it, and I will go there again and again. Shawarma is my favorite sandwich, and since I moved to US, I couldn't find a place that does it in the right way. This restaurant took me back home. So delicious, and the Hookah is amazing Stuff are very nice and helpful I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"After getting take-out here almost 10 times, I just have to write a review. I'm Armenian and the food is almost the same food I grew up eating. You can tell the food is always fresh and it's always delicious. I would suggest the pita sampler appetizer, soooo much food for your money. The kabob dinner comes with two sides and it's enough to share as well. The hummus is the best ever. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My family tried this restaurant for the first time today and were blown away. He food was spiced to perfection and the portions were incredible!  The waitress was SUPER attentive and my two younger three year old sisters were smitten with her.  We will definitely be back very soon. Fantastic work!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner here on a moderate Saturday night. I sampled their vegetarian platter, chicken kebab, and chicken shawarma. The only things worth trying are the hummus and the chicken kebab skewer. Everything else was either too salty or too bland. The pita bread came out warm and nice but ended up hard and awkward a couple minutes later. I could tell that their menu was a bit too similar to another Mediterranean restaurant down the street in Matthews. I want to see more originality in this new pita place and not imitation. Finally, the wait staff. I had 2-3 waiters serving on me. They did not work together and communicate well to each other. My check came out wrong, they forgot my takeout order until I reminded them, they tried to take my silverware away before my entree came out, and it took them three tries to get my check right. Hopefully in the future, they will get a better trained staff and more originality present in their restaurant."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly. The pita was amazing and hummus good but went downhill for the rest of the meal. The beef Schwarma was so dry and tasteless. The rice had no flavor. Lamb shank was fair. Much better choices for middle eastern in the area."}
{"text":"I have to tell you I've been going to this location the last year since they opened. I have had just about every item on the menu and there is not one negative comment, not one bad dish. Vegan, vegetarian, omnivore (the lamb and beef are wonderfully seasoned!) I encourage you to try them out. Clean, huge portions, always fresh and I enjoy talking to the staff. They explain the meaning of each dish and ingredients. It really is a pleasure dining here and they have enough space to accommodate large parties. Oh, you won't be disappointed by their wonderful wine list, love the Chilean Merlot. You can stop in for a quiet lunch, or dinner, you are always treated wonderfully. The owner stops by each table to make sure your meal was satisfactory. I love trying all manner of what I call tapas, so fresh, the pita is amazing but most of all I truly enjoy the delicate seasonings in each dish. I'm Italian, Sicilian, so appreciate the Mediterranean touch.....but truly, if you enjoy food, you need to try the Babaghanouj, Lentils, cauliflower, and (I'm going to maul the name, so sorry!) Makanek (this AMAZING little sausage with grilled tomato chunks).....I love this little place and hope they are here for the long haul. Thank you for another beautiful meal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been twice at lunch time and the food is very good.  I had the chicken schwarma platter with lentil soup and salad.  There is so much food I was full after the soup and salad.  The server was ver nice but food took forever.  Our starters took 30 minutes and the schwarma came out 20 minutes after that.  If you have limited time at lunch this would not be a good option for you."}
{"text":"This is a great place for Lebanese food. The portions are very generous and the food was great. The vegetarian platter was more than one person could eat. The pita was fluffy and very fresh. The salmon was good and the falafel was just right. Don't miss this chance to find excellent food an great service. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome!!!   The service is great, the food is wonderful, we have a new favorite!!!  Try the spicy beef shawarma salad!!!!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!!! It's only been one visit and it's already my favorite restaurant in Matthews. First off, the decor really does set the ambience. We were sat at a table with a sorts of middle eastern antiques. Secondly, the staff is very welcoming and friendly. They are patient and well read in their menu. Finally, and this it the most important part, THE FOOD IS AMAZING. I sampled the baba ghanouj, hummus, and tabouli, all perfectly spiced and smoked. The pita came to the table fresh out the oven. Because I came with my family, we decided to try the family platter, which a mix of lamb, kafta, and chicken kabob along with rice and vegetables. I am not even being drastic when I say it put Kebab-Je and all other Middle Eastern restaurants to shame. The spices were spot on in the meats and the rice was among the best I've ever had. Definitely coming back and soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, very affordable, and attentive service.  I have been when they were busy when the service was a bit off, but they try at all times.  The pita sampler 2 is amazing, baba ganoush never tasted so good.  The lamb or cauliflower sandwiches are amazing, although the skewer was left in one once.    The restaurant gets a lot of Middle Easterners because the food is genuine and it is also inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food! The servings are huge and we had to take leftovers home for another meal. Too bad we were too full for desserts but they have a good selection of desserts (baklava, tiramisu, cheesecakes etc..). Maybe next time we will try them and we will definitely be back. This place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant previously and had good experiences. Tonight was exceptionally bad. After getting seated and ordering a simple falafel sandwich, after 40 minutes and no sign of my dinner, I left the establishment. The place seemingly has a lot of staff who appear to constantly be moving around everywhere, but whatever it is they are doing, it doesn't involve SERVING customers.   Highly disappointing experience. Has completely turned me off the place. Will never return.   Owner/manager needs to do a better job in training his wait staff and attend to customers better. Apparently he doesn't get the first rule in long-term success in the restaurant business is *consistency* - BOTH in quality AND service.  Horrible!"}
{"text":"This place is nowhere near our house, but we find ourselves here at least once a month. The vegetarian sampler plate is absolute heaven, and the portions are so huge that I have leftovers for at least three meals. And the staff!! Such big-hearted and wonderful people!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I really wasn't impressed with the food. It was fine but nothing I would want to eat again. I had the steak kabobs and they had a weird taste. I tried chicken Kabobs from my wife and they were better just not great"}
{"text":"I had to check this place out because I'm a huge fan of kebab je in matthews. The food here was almost the exact same as kebab je. The portions were much larger however. The rice that accompanied the shwarma I ordered was ok. A little dry, not a lot of flavor. The chicken was great. My husband, who is Greek, ordered lamb. He hated it. At first he swore it wasn't lamb, then he said it just wasn't seasoned. The wait staff was awesome. The food was good and the portions enormous! I'm sure I will come here again. I love Lebanese food, but I just don't see how two Lebanese restaurants very close to each other with almost exact same menus will survive."}
{"text":"One of the best Lebanese places in the Charlotte area!  I highly recommend the Vegetarian platter: Falafel, houmus, patatas harra, cauliflower and mujaddarah are included.  Also the mixed grill is amazing and their homemade pita bread is to die for! Sam is the best! So friendly!"}
{"text":"Awkward servce, okay food. We'll keep looking for something better in the area."}
{"text":"I have never dined in, but I have ordered catering from them multiple times. They are an office favorite. The food is amazingly good, and they always give very generous portions. They are also very courteous and responsive to my emails. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was adequate but the service left much to be desired. Waited over 35 minutes for a to-go order that shouldn't have taken 10."}
{"text":"we went there to get a quick meal and just ordered two sandwiches. we waited 20 minutes and we got the excuse that they messed up the order in the kitchen.   we left without getting anything.  I don't believe  that two sandwiches would be hard to make.  two other groups came behind us aqndnd got their food first.  this place is slow and not friendly.  if there was a way to give a negative star I would."}
{"text":"First time here my husband has been here before and said lets go to a really good restaurant. It was a bit of a drive, but worth it. Malek was our server and he was awesome! The owner Sam even came out to greet us. Great service and amazing food!!! We will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I just personally want to thank the staff and Sam for all the AMAZINGNESS we encountered at this restaurant! I have always loved Mediterranean food, I grew up eating it. When I brought my hubby for his first time eating real authentic Mediterranean food he was apprehensive at first, but he was blown away by the deliciousness of the food here. Some quotes about the appetizer:  (for reference we had the pita platter #2 ((grape leaves, hummus, baba ganoush, falafel, etc))  \"oh my gosh.\" \"this is great.\" \"How is anything this good?\" \"I feel so healthy eating this.\"  We both save most of the appetizer and decided on lamb shanks as Sam had suggested with yellow rice. I had the salad, he [my husband] had the lentil soup. Both delectable and super filling so we saved those too.  The lamb was fall-off-the-bone amazing. The veggies, cooked to perfection. It really was an excellent meal.  Last but not least when our gorgeous server suggested dessert (my husband protested) but I asked if they had baklava to go, of course which they did. He has never had it. When she brought it to the table i took a small bite and asked him to try it. His eyes LIT UP. Absolutely some of the best i've had (and it's rich, so not a lot is needed) but it was soooo good.   The best part other than the huge amount of food, and it being so delicious, and sooooo inexpensive (this can feed us both for a few days) was how you feel like your family and truly appreciated and invited to share in such a wonderful culture with some wonderful people. You guys keep doing what you're doing!  -The Essmans"}
{"text":"I feel really spoiled that ANOTHER delicious Kabob restaurant has come to Matthews! They've only been open a week and were pretty busy Sunday night considering that.   I like how they redid the space, there are lots of separate dining areas, a bar area & a patio (didn't get to check that out though). They said they will start serving beer and wine within a week, bonus!  Everyone working in the restaurant was really friendly and helpful - we were asked so many times if everything was okay or if we needed anything. Actually some of the staff and the chef came here from Kabab Je, so it's worth checking them out if you're a fan of Kabab Je.   The food was as delicious as I'd hoped - we split our \"regular\"- the mixed grill (3 kabobs - chicken, lamb, kafta), the falafel appetizer and hummus. The entrees come with two sides, so we got saffron rice and salad. We had so much food, we had leftovers for the next night! Everything was amazing and I can see myself going here every week."}
{"text":"This is a good dining option in Matthews.  Not outstanding, but very solid in both.  What makes it so attractive is the price point for lunch specials.  For two of us, the bill was right around $18.  I had lentil soup, a chicken kabob, yellow rice, and grilled veggies.  My lunch companion had the shrimp kabob.  Everything tasted too salty for both of our likings.  By no means does that mean that we didn't clean our plates!  The restaurant was clean and the service was very good.  I liked that it was cozy and a quiet space.  Definitely do not judge the place by its exterior.   There is charm on the inside that you just don't see on the outside.  Sometimes that's just the way it is in life!"}
{"text":"this is the absolute best Lebanese place in Charlotte. Great food, great service, awesome atmosphere. The owners walk around and make sure you are happy. Huge portions for a very reasonable price. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Kebbe nayye is very good, if you preorder. Bread is good. fattoosh is good. chicken is good. all in all good food."}
{"text":"I wanted to have a go again for Mediterranean food.  I've had this restaurant bookmarked for a while.  I was convinced that it would be good from the look/passion of the chefs face.  I ordered the mix shawmara and knafeh.  Both I've had before at another establishment across town but wanted it closer by.  There was no wait when I walked in and dinner time was just starting as soon as I walked in.  I waited probably non more than 15 mins for my food.  I suppose the price was fair although the knafeh was pricey but a pretty big size as Mousa the waiter assured me.  The shawarma was flavorful and loved the veggies.  It was very unique to have cranberries mixed in.  The chicken seemed reheated or cooked under a brick/pressed.  It was stiff and broke in chucks with my fork.  If this is normal, then I'll stick to beef.  I'd like to try the grape leaves (from an actual restaurant) and kebab next time."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place. Great food, huge servings ( almost too much), priced right and friendly staff ."}
{"text":"I eat here often. They make outstanding hummus, tabbouleh, falafel, lamb, etc. Very good service and the owner, Sam, is outstanding with all the customers. Every time I have been there the bathrooms have been perfectly clean."}
{"text":"This was very good.  We are long time customers and big fans of another similar restaurant in Matthews, but thought we'd try this restaurant for variety.  The server was gracious, friendly and patient.  Very polite and accommodating. I didn't mind the decor.  It's not fancy, but adequate.  The food was plentiful.  We ordered all our favorites and the comparison began.  Our habit is to order all appetizers and share with each other.  Falafel are better at Pita Kabab and you get five.  Kibbeh my husband also preferred here.  The spicy potatoes were less crisp and not as piping hot, however it is a larger serving and might be spicier -- so a draw there. I certainly pigged out on them.   We had Tabbouleh and the Pita Kabab salad which I combine...just a personal taste I make and add the garnish of pickles, radishes and mint and it was basically the same.  The negatives for me, the beef/lamb shawarma and hummus was not as tasty as I am used to.  The meat sliced a bit thicker and a lack of seasoning of the hummus. It was bland.  Also a big negative was the pita.  It was warm and plentiful, but it's just not fresh made and baked on site.  It didn't matter how plentiful it was when we didn't want to gobble it up.  Those are the favorite aspects of our meal when we eat Mediterranean so that's significant to us.  Plus side is there's beer and wine if you like that, it's irrelevant to me.  More indoor seating here.  Ambiance and outside seating at the other place.  There's allot of pluses to this restaurant.  It's a solid choice!  We'll be back to see if it evolves in a good way, bad way or not at all."}
{"text":"I had a favorite Mediterranean restaurant when we lived in Nashville 20 years ago and have been looking for one that measures up to it ever since. I finally found one! We love Pita Kabab!! We have come here as a family, had meetings and church gatherings here, and have ordered take out many times, as well. We have never been disappointed! The pitas, hummus, falafel, mujadarah, grape leaves.... everything is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Now this place is good. The interiors ain't anything fancy, the restaurant is big with ample parking but the tables and seating space is small. This can be a cause for discomfort. The service is great and prompt, we were a group of 4 and were given seats right away. The pita break and baba ganoush were great. The bread was served hot and the combo tasted good. We had ordered chicken wings and they were exceptionally good. This alone was bring you back here. The entree portions are big so be mindful of the number of dishes you order. The chicken was subtle in terms of spices, for my taste, but well done. I have to say the rice served along was very nice and well flavored. They do have some beer varieties, if you want to try. The knafa is a dessert which I was trying for the first time and it's worth the try. Be sure to actually take the portion of cheese into the pita (kind of) bread and then dip it into the rose water syrup before having it. The order has to be followed for an amazing taste experience. The dessert isn't a sugar rush kind of feel but a pleasant feel of sweet flavors for the taste buds. Do give them a try."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! The food is superb, the staff is helpful & courteous. The prices are great for the amount of food. The ingredients are fresh, delicious & colorful. The spices are engaging. My family & I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Really surprised at the bad reviews... but since this place has not been open long, I would state that growing pains are going to happen in the first few months.  For us, today, it was very good. The kafta khash khash was very tasty. I normally just go with schwarma at Mediterranean places, but decided to try something new and I'm glad I did. Our server, Rosanna (ask for her when you dine there because she's awesome) recommended I get the rice with my dish... did not disappoint. The result was a mountain of food which I could not finish. I cannot remember if I've ever brought home leftovers from a restaurant from my plate.. my wife and daughter.. always.. me... nope. I have either dinner tonight or lunch tomorrow waiting for me in the fridge.  Now mind you, we LOVE Kabab Je... but my wife swears the hummus at Pita Kabab was better than at Kebab Je. We got enough food for two meals today at lunch."}
{"text":"I really like Pita Kabab Grill. It has been a great experience since the first time I went there. I was not sure what to expect the first time, but the waiter was so kind and took the time to walk me through the menu and helped me find the perfect meal! Since then I've always had great service here. The food...I love the menu. They have some amazing hummus with fresh baked pita. Sometimes I just come here for the hummus! I also love the lentil soup that comes with the platters. All of the platters are great. Sometimes my husband and I share the combo platter. The portions are huge. You get a lot of food for the money. The atmosphere is...odd...but you go there for the friendly service and food!"}
{"text":"Im giving this a 1 star rating because there is no lower rating. The Hummus had a burned taste and left a heavy aftertaste of smokiness. The Tabouleh was DRY The Chicken Shawarma sandwich was tasteless and sloppy. The Shish Tawook Sandwich was DRY and tasteless The Kibbeh was DRY The Cucumber Yogurt Salad was OK The Tiramisu was awful in taste and texture. They were highly understaffed and it took them 45 minutes to approach us!  I will never return and will immediately go back to Kabab Je for any future Mediterranean food craving....."}
{"text":"We got take out for lunch today. I got the mixed kabobs which come with Chicken, lamb, and Kofta kabobs with fries and a \"side salad\" ( the side salad is a lot bigger than other restaurants. The food was cooked to perfection and the service was excellent. This is definitely a diamond in the rough and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food is generally pretty good. Fast and reasonably priced. Love their apps and salads! I wish the atmosphere was a bit more inviting. This place could be really great!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Their hummus is the best I have ever tasted, I thought I hated grape leaves - until I tasted Pita Kebab's. So good! The chicken shawarma is phenomenal. The service is wonderful - lovely people with great suggestions for what to order. Major bonus - the portions are so generous that you have leftovers for a few days."}
{"text":"Love this place. Stopped on my way to the Airport..... Photo lunch appeared is less than 10 min... wife says 5 min..."}
{"text":"First up, is it Kabab Je? No, it is not. But it is miles better than the Mexican place that used to be here, and a good deal better than the Italian place that was here before that. Plus, there is a ton more room than Kabab Je even when there is no one dining.  On the downside, it is a touch dark - not sure if they can do a lot about that. It's just the way the building is constructed. But they have done a lot with it, so that it doesn't look like someone just set up shop in an abandoned building and started serving food one night. Add to that the servers are happy to help at a moment's notice (well, a couple moments - they are mostly young, so all things phone-like attract their attention).  Once you get things going, however, it's off to the races. The food here is definitely the star. Much like at Kabab Je, the moutabal is a great starter. There might be a tad less smokiness in the taste, but it feels like you get a bit more if it, so we'll call that a draw. In a similar vein, you get about all the pita you can eat, and on this point, Kabab Je probably wins. It's not that the pita isn't good, as it is - but here is is just not quite as fresh. Perhaps a slight bit thinner, or maybe coming out faster would help. The steaming hot bread from Kabab Je is just tough to beat.  After you pass the appetizer, however, it's actually a different story. The kababs here are quite likely better - the aroma is incredible, and the chicken, kafta and lamb are all quite tasty. Even the vegetables are a notch above and rice that pairs nicely with the dish, definitely making this a worthwhile stop not only in downtown Matthews, but if you are anywhere on the east side."}
{"text":"Based on the number of great ratings and several trusted recommendations, I had high hopes for loving this place. Our table had tabouli, foul, Greek salad, vegetarian sampler, and lamb shank.  There was nothing that I really liked and we left more than we ate. Disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was hit or miss. Lamb kebab was well cooked and the garlic sauce was great, but otherwise, just average - mediocre at best. The service, on the other hand, was among the worst we have ever experienced, by far."}
{"text":"Excellent service!  The waitress was very helpful in picking out menu items and making suggestions.  Everything we ordered was delicious!  We started with the sampler 2.  The eggplant was incredibly delicious along with all the other items included.  When the kabobs came I was practically full already but managed to eat some and have plenty to take home.  Delicious!  Baklava and Turkish coffee to end the meal.  We will be back again!  There was a band and belly dancer performing too.  I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Did take out Friday evening, very generous portions.  Saja was our server, she was terrific.  Sam is a great Manager/Owner."}
{"text":"We were here with a party of about 20. Where do I start, it's awesome. Every single thing was awesome. Garlicky/yogurt sauce, hummus, skewered Kofta, lamb, chicken -  yum. Salads. Even water is good.  Come back often."}
{"text":"Terrible, slow service. Went during lunch and there were plenty of workers and empty tables. The servers and manager would look at the table and constantly miss empty drinks, empty plates, etc. The food was alright at best."}
{"text":"I loved this place. To start the waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and food. He was patient with our questions and we knew little about some of the foods. We had some expirience with greek food. Lebonnese food is a little diffrent. You could tell the waiter had tried different foods on the menu and made recommendations. We started with the fried cauliflower. It was so yummy!! Tender and flavorful! The salad was huge and had a wonderful light vinegar and oil dressing, radishes, cukes. I had to take salad home. Then the entree came. Yummy grilled veggies, rice that was like butter and chicken so tender and juicy....heaven!! I liked the yogurt sauce also. I will be back! My friend who was in the restaurant business is always said she tried to place 3 times before deciding if she really likes it or not because things didn't change so to those who may not like this place at first maybe try it again because seems like the majority of us love it. To each is own."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time and it was awesome!  Everyone was so friendly!   The waitress was very attentive,  knowledgeable and she couldn't do enough to make our experience enjoyable. She was great!   The food was so fresh and PLENTIFUL!!!  There was so much food,  I'll be eating for a couple of days. Price was super reasonable.  The 3 of us were stuffed for $45!  The sampler player was enough to share and everything was delicious. They have a garlic sauce to die for!   I highly recommend this place,  the food will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"So many great things I can say about this place but I'm going to keep it short and sweet. The absolute best thing about Pita Kabob is the freshness of the food! Everything is served straight from the kitchen to the table, the food doesn't sit out waiting for a waiter to pick it up. They give their customers healthy portions of fresh veggies, juicy chicken, fluffy rice, amazing sauces & deserts! They are quick, efficient, and above all, welcoming. They treat you like they would a guest in their own home. The owner of the joint is always a friendly face to see. He's always greet and joke around with his customers.  Pita Kabob's just one of those restaurant you're going to have to try out for yourself to know how amaze balls it is. The food alone will make you come back for more, the friendly staff tops it off!"}
{"text":"The pita kebab Grill had excellent servings plenty to eat the lamb was excellent the grilled vegetables were excellent the only thing I would've changed about this is that I ordered the shrimp kebabs and the chicken kebabs and they were both extremely salty. The hummus plate was excellent with the grape leaves in the pita bread was awesome."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and they never disappoint.  The baba ganoush is always amazing."}
{"text":"This place is really lovely, we're thrilled to live near it. Absolutely top notch Lebanese food, seasoned to perfection. They have the right balance of spice, lemon, high quality oil, smoke, and salt. All ingredients are 100% fresh and everything is house made. The portions are huge (see photo). The interior is clean and comfortable and the entire staff made us feel so, so welcome! Our host was super friendly, our waitress was one of the best waitresses we've had in a long time, and we even met the owner who was also very gracious. I was impressed with how much everyone at Pita Kabab cares...they really want guests to feel comfortable and to have a great time. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Delecious food and the best serves ever this place is amazing best quality in charlotte all meet halal"}
{"text":"Here is an update ..It's still amazing and I have a new love it's the Kafta Kebab with spicy tomato sauce and veggies.This is our go to place now Easter, My Birthday anytime people come from out of town. Now that they are on Door Dash we never have to go without"}
{"text":"This place was great!!!!  I was surprised that I was so happy with it.  I came here on Christmas Eve and was seated right away.  There was a decent crowd, but no wait.  The waiter didn't speak much English, but was able to assist the best he could with the menu.   I started out with the baba ghanoush (which I can't really figure out how to spell..but eat frequently) and it was amazing. Some of the best I've ever had.  And a huge portion! The pita was def the best I have had.  So fresh and delicious.  I also had the beef kebab in a sandwich with tomato and pickles.  Phenomenal!!! The beef was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The sauce inside (hummus I believe) and pickles tasted great together.  Very impressed, since I am picky about meat.    HUGE portions, great prices, exceptional service!!  I will be coming back soon and I can't wait!!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area, wanted to grab take out bc were exhausted. Have read reviews and saw mixed opinions about some \"other\" place so here is an unbiased opinion from a family who had never been to either.   The customer service was good according to my husband he was greeted and even offered a drink on the house while waiting to pick up our food so there's a star.   Got the food home (we live about five minutes away) food was still hot which is a good thing.   My husband got the mixed grill kebabs thing, I got the vegetarian platter. And he ordered a side of hummus. It's true the portions are very large! But we honestly did not enjoy the food that much. We eat hummus literally every day, and this hummus is far from the best Hummus We've ever had. My husband said it kind of tasted like pizza in a weird way ..in my opinion it kind of tasted smoked which maybe that is how they wanted it to taste? But it's just not for us. we don't really have any desire to return especially at those prices, when I can cook at home."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try on a Saturday at 6:00.  There were 4 of us and a toddler and we were able to be seated right away.  3 of us had the beef kabobs and one had the chicken. Entrees come with a salad which was pretty good but maybe a little to much parsley. The bread they bring you is excellent and paired with the hummus was fantastic. Hummus was out of this world.   The beef kabobs were sooooo good. You have a choice of sides, I picked the rice, also comes with some grilled vegetables. It's a decent amount of food and definitely worth the price. I didn't try the chicken but I was told it was good, she had enough to bring some home.   If you like the other Mediterranean place not far away from this one you should without a doubt give Pita Kabob a try. Apparently the old chef from that place split and opened Pita Kabob which would explain why the food is so very similar.   The only issue we had was that the baby needed changing and the restrooms don't have a changing table. Changing a baby in a car that's been sitting in the NC June sun isn't ideal.    Other than that this place has a new regular customer- it's excellent!  5/22/18 We used to absolutely love this place but unfortunately every time we go back everything but the prices seem to get smaller and smaller. It's no longer a good value for the money. It's to bad because we really loved it here and I originally had it at 5 stars. We would frequent this place 2-3 times a month. Now we go there maybe once every few months."}
{"text":"Excellent hummus, delicious falafel and kafta.  Chicken kabab was really good and Lamb kabab was tasty but a little dry.  Huge portions!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Servings were huge!  Best service and food we have had in a long time!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and awesome food!  We've been here a few times and never been let down.  The portions are huge and the price is right.  It has almost the exact same menu as Kebob-Je which is nearby, but it is a bit cheaper.  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Just ate lunch here and the quality has gone down. Poor service, understaffed. Ordered the lamb sandwich with no pickles and of course it came with pickles. Meat was very chewy. Not sure what happened to this place but it went down hill. The owner sent me a message and said he doesn't not need customers like me, guess the truth hurts."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but it seems some missteps are keeping them back.   Wanted a meat schwarma sandwich with no tomato, add garlic sauce and turnips.   Got a sandwich full of tomato and no sauce or turnips.   Side of bread was good but not great.   Would I go back?  Sure. And and I hop they do a better job of custom orders"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch.  Had the pita sampler #1 (babbaganoush, hummus, stuffed grape leaves)... yum.  Then had the chicken shawarma sandwich.  Very good.  Different than at Zetouni's but equally tasty.  I'll definitely be back.  Hope Matthews residents discover them and they stay in business."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe these 5 star reviews. This place isn't terrible, but it is definitely average. There was so much wrong!  Decor: Downright depressing. Our large party was seated in a far off room with absolutely no decor and silverware wrapped in paper napkins. I felt like we'd traveled back in time and were sitting at the kids' table.   Service: fine during dinner but when we got the check...whoa! I'll get to that later.   Food:  Falafel-dry, dense, and bland. A boxed version prepared at home is much better Stuffed grape leaves-passable but quite *meh* Beef kabob-dry and tough. Took my dog 20 minutes to gnaw on a piece at home-no joke Chicken kabob-flavorful but dry Shrimp kabob-in a lemon garlic  sauce that didn't taste like lemon OR garlic. Also, the shrimp was drenched in it.  Veggies with the kabobs-mushy  Kibbeh(my absolute favorite food)-dry, dry, dry Tabouleh-not enough lemon or tomatoes or salt or oil. Basically chopped parsley with a minuscule amount of bulgur.  Tabouleh is one of the easiest things to get right yet somehow it was all wrong.  Kufte kebab-if you choose to go, order this. The meat was flavorful and juicy. The only star of the night.   Portions are large and come with soup or salad and rice or fries. Prices are fair.   Drinks: We ordered 2 glasses of Merlot. We received them ice cold in small glasses which had 1/4 pour in them. The pour was closer to a wine tasting, than an actual glass of wine.   SCAM ALERT: We had ordered 2 kids meals (which come with a drink).  The check came and we were charged for those sodas. We then noticed that 2 small glasses of wine had been charged ($5.99. ea), voided out and then added as 2 large glasses of wine for $8.99 ea. What???!!! $8.99 for a small glass filled a fourth of the way with cheap, chilled merlot?    They just started serving wine and the waiter didn't know what they had and there was no wine list. Unacceptable.  The owner needs to list the wines and prices for the waiter until they get their sh*t together and provide a wine list. We, of course, brought all this to the attention of our waiter.  He claimed only fruit punch is free with kids meals. He also said that the merlot in particular is the same price for a small or large glass. Just the merlot. Okaaaayyy. He adjusted the bill.   A 20% gratuity was added automatically. Didn't see that mentioned on the menu but to be fair, I wasn't looking for it. So make sure you check before tipping. As a matter of fact, scrutinize every single item on the check. Between the extra 20% we almost added, the $4 for the sodas, the $6 for the supposed large wines, we almost overpayed by $50."}
{"text":"So great to have a Good Mediterranean place right in downtown Matthews. Their hummus and pita bread was absolutely delicious and so fresh. I had the lamb shawarma with some rice and really enjoyed it as Wells The place that night had servers and hostesses everywhere and I always felt we were constantly being attended too which made it a great date night."}
{"text":"After seeing a number of people recommending this place (downtown Matthews) a friend and I went. My friend's father is Palestinian so whenever we go out for lunch it's always for Mediterranean. La Shish & Kabab Je being the most frequent stops.   The chef (Nasim) at Pita Kabab is the former chef from Kabab Je. So, when the food came out and it looked incredibly familiar in prep, it made sense once the chef came and introduced himself.   I love La Shish but I must say I'll probably move my support over to Pita Kabab. The food is amazing, the guy is just starting out and if we could have that location in downtown Matthews successfully make it (instead of being a revolving door of restaurants) I for one couldn't be happier. I'm sold.   In short; completely worth it and the prices are so cheap I wonder how he's even keeping the door open. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I trusted the good reviews and ordered carry out. There are so many better Mediterranean restaurants in Charlotte: Pita Kabob was so overpriced for the poor quality of the food! We were so disappointed and felt sick. Two mixed kabob entrees with french fries, yellow rice and some mooshy vegetables were all over cooked, bland, and stale tasting (really, we couldn't taste spices or flavor). I think the oil they used must have been rancid or really poor quality. My toddler was having disgusting smelling gas the evening and day after he ate some of the meat and french fries, and I had an upset stomach. Even my seven year old who normally goes crazy for French fries (a rare treat for our family) didn't bother much with them. We paid over $40 for two entrees and two small pieces of Baklava (which weren't good, either). I am frustrated we wasted our money. I'm not sure why there are good reviews here. I normally love to compliment people and places, but the food was just so awful that I felt obligated to warn others."}
{"text":"The fresh baked bread alone is worth the trip, and the hummus that goes with it. My chicken shawarma was heavy on the feta, which is the correct amount."}
{"text":"My family visited this place maybe 2 months ago and loved it. It's a family owned restaurant and their service and food is amazing. We returned yesterday for take two and it did not disappoint. The amount of food you get for the price is outstanding. The food is freshly made and is mouth watering.   I ordered the hummus and chicken shawarma appetizer and it ended up being my meal. The hummus was prepared perfectly! So good I don't think I could prepare it in my kitchen after trying 1000 times. Which sounds crazy because its a basic dish but wow theirs is great. The chicken was seasoned well and very juicy. My son tried to eat my plate instead of his chicken and fries.   My wife had the platter #2 which was amazing as well. It's a huge plate of hummus, falafel, and Baba ghanouj(spell check). This plate was very fresh as well and is very healthy.   Upon check out our server was so nice and my 2 year old son loved her. She asked him if he wanted to come with her. Being a huge flirt he said \"yesssss\". She took him to the front counter and let him hit the buttons on the computer to check us out. He loved every bit of it.   This place is a must go! Please support their business."}
{"text":"Myself & 2 buddies dropped in The Pita Kabab Grill while in Matthews, NC. The Kababs were very delicious, our server was very knowledgeable of the menu & helped us decide on our meals that afternoon! A nice place to chill & eat!"}
{"text":"Man, I don't get it.  Why are the reviews so stellar?  How does this happen?  Is it really because we all want to so badly believe that Matthews actually has something decent to offer in terms of restaurants?  Are we that desperate that we are willing to kid ourselves?    The owner is very nice and it is my understanding that he was the chef from je kebab?  Or something like that...whatever, details not important.  Bottom line....the food is just not good, the atmosphere leaves MUCH to be desired.  The place has a feel of an old Shoney's.  We had a party of 10 and everyone except for one (the one who would eat mayo on a cupcake if given the opportunity) hated their food.  We all ordered different items but the consistent complaint was that the chicken grossed everyone out.  It was dry, tasteless, and disgusting.  Everything else was either bland, dried out or tasted old.    Overpriced for the quality and just not a pleasant experience.  I hate it because I would love nothing more than another solid restaurant in this area but this isn't it.  ***Update, all of the above now make sense after reading Zack P's review...****"}
{"text":"Delicious food, huge portions, and reasonable prices! We went for lunch and left stuffed and happy with enough food for another meal in to to go bag.   We tried the falafel and hummus appetizers, which were excellent. The pita is very good. My dining companion ordered the salmon skewer lunch plate. It came with superb grilled vegetables, a large fresh salad, and a giant bowl of soup. Everything was delicious.   The restaurant has plenty of seating and is comfortable. I prefer this place over the other Middle Eastern place in town because it has fountain drinks, large portion lunch specials for $7-8, and great service. I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This is the best Lebanese food I've had since moving to the Charlotte area in 2001!  The baba ganoush, fried cauliflower with tahini, mujadarah and falafel were all amazing.  This place is so new that they don't yet have a website. It's beautiful, the chef is amazing, and the service is great.  My mother had the salmon kabob, and the portion was so huge that she had to take half home.  They're located next to the post office in Matthews. You must check out this wonderful restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not great. The cooks/owners were fighting loudly in the back. Weird environment. Falafal wasn't great. Not too impressed. Our waitress was nice though and the pita was fresh."}
{"text":"When I hear that chef Nasim had opened a place of His own I knew I had to come for a visit.  It's one thing to review a restaurant for it's delicious food, but something completely different  when you can review a restaurant because of its ownership.  Nasim and Sam create such a warm and welcome environment you feel like you're family.  The food? It's unmatched in this area.  I've visited the middle east, and since then I've tried every restaurant I can find claiming their recipes are authentic.  I'm not a scholar on authentic middle eastern Food, but from New York down to Florida, above all the restaurants I've tried, this one is the best in my opinion hands down.  I used to be a regular at Kabob Je in Matthews.  In the last several months it hasn't been the same, and I realized it was because Nasim had left.  I'm not sure the reasons behind his departure, but I'm glad he opened this one!  It's a hit!  Not only can it fit over 200 people, but it's a hookah bar and alcohol will soon be served at his full bar.  I highly recommend at least trying it out! It's not expressive either!  There's something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I am so thrilled to not only have another Lebanese place in Matthews, but one with some of the best food I've ever had! The service is friendly and fast and the portions are huge, especially for the price, it's a true steal. The pita is fresh baked and to die for, the baba ganoish and hummus are so well blended and spices, the grape leaves and falafel were hands down the best I have ever had, moist and full of flavor. I tried both lamb shank and lam kabobs and I've never had lamb cooked better besides by my family. I'll be a new regular. Oh, and try the lentil soup as your side starter, it is a meal in and of itself."}
{"text":"The best place for Mediterranean food I've eaten in years. Absolutely delicious. Service was amazing. Def coming back"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  I have had a variety of dishes and they are all great. The kabobs are great and so are the sides.   Huge portions and great customer service.   I highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"This is an INCREDIBLE spot for Lunch or Dinner! The food is FANTASTIC, everything on the menu is outstanding, love the Meat Swarma Sandwichs, Hummas is incredible, Salads very good and the quantities are very large, expect good leftovers.   Family owned(Sam) with good service and staff, this spot will be a regular stop once you try it!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a handful of times and every time I leave I can't wait to go again!!  Prices are great with amazing portions!!  The hummus is the creamiest and tastiest hummus EVER. The chicken shawarma is tasty with the garlic sauce. Everything is fresh with many herbs and flavors.  The servers are super sweet and very respectful to guests. It was my 3 year old's birthday and they sang in English and Arabic!  It's a must try!!"}
{"text":"Yay!!!! The Pita Kabab is now on my favorite restaurant list! Excellent off and the portions were plentiful. Nasim an amazing chef (former chef of a local restaurant), has lots of variety on the menu and everything (except the french fries) is made in house). Please do not let the outside dissuade you.  Stop in once, and you will become a repeat customer.  The restaurant can seat 200+ people.  They have a lovely patio where they have set up a Hookah lounge. I ate lunch there yesterday with a girlfriend, and I plan to return this evening for dinner with my husband.   The Pita Kebab is a wonderful addition to Matthews! Welcome and wishing you lots of luck."}
{"text":"Attended a banquet here with my wife. Was excited that they offered vegan/vegetarian options. I started off with the vegetarian platter. The falafel and hummus was on point. The fried cauliflower was nothing out of the ordinary. However that baba ghanoush was beyond nasty . Wanted to taste the texture of the eggplant but the overwhelmingly taste of charcoal did not work with this black man's taste buds. I ended up ordering the deluxe falafel sammich which was magical . My wife ordered the fried cauliflower and Greek salad which she said was aiight. Will I be back, probably not since it's so far away from Charlotte and so freakin' expensive. In conclusion, I would only recommend this establishment only if you want to try something different."}
{"text":"Had the rack of lamb, very very good.  Large portions.  Definitely recommend this place.  Very nice service."}
{"text":"Went to Pita Kabob on 9/21/16.  Had driven by it many times and noticed the large number of cars in the parking lot; a sure sign that the restaurant was probably pretty good.  We were not disappointed.  Girl friend has the chicken kabob with mixed veggies, said It was the best she ever had.  I had the lamb shank with mixed vegetables; the wow factor was off the charts.  Best lamb I've had in years.  The pita bread is served hot and fresh with a garlic butter that just tops it off, and a killer chicken soup.  And don't pass up the rice dish, it is amazing.  This is just one of the best restaurants in Matthews.  Don't miss it!!!"}
