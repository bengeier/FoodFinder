{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary dinner at La Torretta Ristorante. It was an outstanding experience!! The ambiance was charming. The food (we are vegetarians) as well as the wine selections were excellent. The service was great - Darius served our table and was knowledgeable, attentive and funny! There is so much pride in service and in how the food is prepared and served. We highly recommend La Torretta Ristorante for special occasions, as well as anytime you feel like having good Italian food with outstanding service."}
{"text":"La Torretta is our family favorite for Italian food. Darius, the owner, does a terrific job of remembering everyone's favorites or customizing to your desires that day. Our kids love the gnocchi bolognese and we love all of the fish entrees. The smoked chicken pasta is fabulous and I have even taken it to parties to rave reviews. Everything is fresh and fabulous. If you like OssoBucco, this is the best in town! Laurie and Rodney and the Boys"}
{"text":"Received a coupon in the mail for one-half off of an entree after purchasing one, and my wife and I decided to give it a go. It's in the neighborhood and we enjoy trying out new restaurants, especially mom and pops type of places.  Quite simply, the reviews below should have sounded off the alarms.    First the positives. The staff is super friendly and courteous, smiling and chatting with you in an effort to make you feel like you're in the East Village (or perhaps in Italy).  The bread (served prior to the meal) was hot and crunchy (but crunchy in a good way).   On to the negatives. The service is extremely slow. We had to ask twice for bread after waiting for about 10 minutes after asking the first time. The food was extremely subpar. I ordered the \"Linguini del Mollusco\", which was very oily (you can literally see the grease dripping off the pasta) and absolutely lacking in flavor.  I could taste plenty of oil unfortunately. The pasta was swimming in grease. The \"Molusco\" element was literally microscopic.  I had the smallest shells I have ever seen, hardly qualifying this as seafood (unless we are to discuss in molecular terms).  My wife had the \"Special\", which was also Linguine but with chicken and artichokes, in the same sort of Chardonnay based sauce. Once again, oily, oily oily.  She is extremely picky with her food and could barely muster more than a few bites.  If one is starving (as I was after a long day at work), one will eat this food (because ultimately it is still food), but at more than $20-30 per entree, it's quite a ripoff.  To make matters worse, the staff decided to add gratuity to our check.  We have been to very classy restaurants (e.g. at Royal Palms) and we have never had gratuity added to our check (rather than us tipping ourselves) for a party of just 2. At the end of the day, with drinks and the coupon, we still spent well more than $60, for very bland food with ridiculously slow service.  We will absolutely not be going back .  If you want delicious Italian food, may I recommend \"Stone and Vine Urban Italian\" on Shea Blvd.  Their pasta is flavorful, their sauces are delicious, and their seafood is NOT microscopic (more seafood than you care to have probably)."}
{"text":"Om nom nom....butternut squash ravioli!!! Yes please, I'll take 2! Not only is the pasta cooked to perfection but the tomato cream sauce is a perfect compliment to the sweetness of the ravioli filling. Darius (the sweet, charming, knowledgeable owner) made me feel like family during my time at La Torretta.  He even offered to pair wine with each course which made me feel like I was at a 5 star 5 diamond restaurant.    After spending 2 months in Italy and eating as much food as one person possibly could, I know good Italian food.  When I feel a pain in my gut for Spaghetti Bolognese, I now find comfort knowing La Torretta is right down the street waiting to give me my fix!"}
{"text":"We had our wedding dinner at La Torretta and it was a perfect evening.  They accommodated our 21 person group wonderfully and made adjustments for dietary (vegetarian) and cultural (Kosher) eating habits with grace and aplomb.  We were advised in the beginning that any change to an existing dish would be done if they could possibly manage it and they followed through with that promise.   Everything was delicious and they timed the courses according to when we were ready for them since everyone was socializing and taking their time.  We never felt rushed and never felt hungry or thirsty.   The wine selection was great and they gifted us with a complimentary bottle as we left.  We will certainly return and highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Another good try from Groupon, just got back from La Torretta, it is a nice place overall. It is at the busy corner of Frank Lloyd Wright and Scottsdale, a very convenience location. The place is cozy and very welcoming, and the service was good and portion is hearty. The owner (or his son) actually took the time to tell us what are the upcoming deal.   Food is good. My friend had the Salmone alla Francesca which was a little plain, but she said the vegetable was good. And I had the Linguine Clams with white chardonnay sauce, I would probably give it a 3.5 out of 5. The taste is very mild and you can actually taste the Clams which is nice but I think it can be better.   Overall a good place especially with the Groupon deal.  Recommended for friend gathering, causal date."}
{"text":"This place was just eh. . .we ordered 2 meals and a dessert. One of the meals was pretty good, but the other meal wasn't so much. The dessert, creme brulee, was awful! Not the worst place I've eaten at, but I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Friday ntght about 7\"00.  We entered and said to  the person at the door (who we were informed was the owner) and said \"Table for three.\"  Without a word he looked us over and led us to a table / booth.   Our waiter came over, asked if we wanted anything to drink and we said we would probably have wine with dinner.   Okay. Wine list was way overpriced, lowest entry around $46 but most were way above $60.  Selected a bottle which we were pleased with, after the waiter first came back and said they were out,   My wife and sister-in-law weren't too hungry and they asked to share a salad and order of spaghetti and meatballs.   I ordered the chicken/sausage cacciatore.   First came the wine (did I mention they had to go back to find the correct bottle).   Then the salad (pretty good actually).   Then a wait, and I mean a wait.   Probably  over 30 minutes minimum.    Wife and sister=in=law had a hefty portion of the spaghetti and meatball, but it was dry, devoid of any sauce  not a hint of red.  Looked like a meatball with spaghetti around it.   My meal was okay, nothing to write home about.  Meanwhile the owner was making his way around the place chatting up the customers (never said a single word to us the entire evening.   Oh yeah, the waiter gave us a coupon to use as my wife had left hers  in her car.  Best part of the evening.  Won't be back"}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago with my husband and sister with a local dine coupon. We were immediately greeted by friendly wait staff and then were accommodated with our request to sit outside. Our waiter was amazing and made sure we always had everything we needed. The food was truly fantastic and you could tell it really was homemade. It was a bit pricey but it was worth it for the taste and huge portions. Great family atmosphere and will return."}
{"text":"Went here for a late Valentine's day dinner. We had set reservations well in advance. The restaurant had kind of a cheesy sky painted in the ceiling. We were placed in a corner table near the bar. It wasn't a huge deal but I did feel separated from the rest of the restaurant. Overall, the decor isn't high end but it's not terrible either.  We were seated immediately by the hostess, which is always nice when it's a busy Friday night. Our service was relatively spot on the entire night. They took a little long on the salad my girlfriend order, but they gave her a full salad instead of the half to compensate. Otherwise, we felt attended to pretty much the whole night.  The food was very good. I ordered the halibut, which was the special for the night. It came out tasting light and very good. My girlfriend ordered the chicken parm which I thought was terrific. Had the creme brulee for dessert and that was great as well.  Overall, we were very happy with our meal and night."}
{"text":"The food was great and so was the service. I'm taking away a star for a mixture or reasons. Plastic flowers in entryway were tacky, the oversized portrait of 1970's Al Pacino staring at me in the restroom is unsettling and the kicker!!!.... I don't want to see a restroom full of anti-aging ads. I'm paying $40 for a steak I shouldn't have to stare at an ad for neck rejuvenate while I wash my hands. Very poor taste!!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent.  The portions are good and we typically share an entrée so we can enjoy an appetizer, salad and maybe even dessert.  The calamari is a favorite...  we ask them to sauté them versus frying it and its very tasty.  I usually get the mozzarella salad or the house garden salad... both very good.  The minestrone soup is also very good... and hearty.  The pastas are all homemade and delicious.  We usually pick something from their daily specials to get away from their regular menu and never disappointed.  The fish specials are always a delight and on the lighter side.  Don't forget about the desert... my fave would be the cheesecake, rich, simple, homemade and just delicious.      We come here about once or twice a month and never disappointed.  Chaz is our server and does a great job recommended things and accommodating every request.  Great location..."}
{"text":"Only open for lunch on Thurs and Fri. Glad we stopped.  I had gnocchi and wife had Florentine chicken. Both were great!  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"One of THE BEST ITALIAN RESTAURANTS IN THE Phoenix   Having been to some of the good  Italian restaurants in US, like Boston north end  ( Giacomo,s Saraceno,s) NYC MarioBatali babbo, Napa, botegga, I feel I have a good point of reference... This restaurant is above average as is the service !  The Pasta Carbonara ROCKS!!"}
{"text":"Just finished lunch. Yummy food with choices  for vegetarians. Try the minestrone soup and the La Amour panini. Service was super including a crumb brush between courses. Make sure to save room for one of their delicious desserts"}
{"text":"I have really mixed feeling about this restaurant. My wife and I got a $15 off $30 deal from groupon and decided to go check this place out knowing nothing about it. It turned out to be an upper scale Italian restaurant in north Scottsdale with fairly expensive food and just an OK atmosphere. Our service was fantastic. The waiter was very friendly and gave us free drinks for making a small mistake on my sons food. Unfortunately the food was sub-par. My wife and I both got Salmon dishes and the fish on both of our plates was very fishy and frozen tasting. The pasta was decent but so heavy that I couldn't eat more than a bite or two. The rest of the food was pretty good but not amazing. The sides, appetizer and dessert were all pretty good. Entries are around $22-$35 and for that price I would expect the food to be fantastic. Unfortunately I've had a better Salmon dish at TGI Fridays. I wish the food had been better because the server was so friendly but it just wasn't. I wouldn't go back or recommend it to any of my friends. I didn't leave upset or angry, just underwhelmed."}
{"text":"The setting is very Roman and Italian when you first walk in. The service is fast, efficient, and friendly. To top it all off, this food rastes like it belongs in Italy. The desserts taste like they belong on the streets of Paris."}
{"text":"My recommendation, do not go!  Tonight's dinner could possibly be the worst experience at any restaurant ever.  Our server was short with us and seemed to have no time and it wasn't even busy.   The food was pure grease with cheeses and sauce. La Torretta was over priced and the atmosphere was plain and seemed quite dated.    I don't know who might have posted the other positive reviews but I can only guess it's family."}
{"text":"This place is expensive and not good. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for Italian food. I would suggest taking your hard earned cash elsewhere. Even Maggiano's across the street has better food."}
{"text":"Two trips to this Restaurante and both times were excellent, with great recommendations from Darius.  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Louis was great. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had one of the best meals we had in a long time. The service and the food was outstanding. We were a party of six and everyone raved about their meal. Large portions. This will be one of our new favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"The owner, the food, the ambiance, the menu couldn't have been more fantastic in every way. Our meals were delicious and the portions were huge. The desserts were simply fantastic. This will be a regular stop if we are in the area again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Italian I've had in a long time.  Great service too!  I had the Ravoli combo and will be back for more ASAP.  The butternut squash ravoli and lobster ravoli were amazing.  I couldn't decide which one to eat last.    My boyfriend had the Salmon and penne with vodka sauce.  The salmon was plentiful and the sauce was fantastic.  We simply couldn't get enough, but with the huge portions ended up with leftovers.    Sadly, there were only a few other patrons there on a Friday night with us.  Restaurants like this should be packed at all times.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a very very long over due review.  Last Valentines day my husband and I did not make plans (he is an emergency doctor).  When he was able to come home early I was so excited, however I knew that every place would be booked.  We have been to La Torretta before, and Italian is my favorite.  I called and spoke to the one of the owners and he was SO nice.  I explained our situation, how it was impossible to make reservations in advance due to our situation and he was so kind on the phone.. told me not to worry, to come on in and he would make it work.  We arrived at the restaurant, had a lovely drink at the bar and waited for our table to be ready.  The food here is amazing and the service was impeccable.  I could not have asked for a nicer Valentines day dinner with my husband.  The restaurant is quaint and the decor is perfect.  If you are considering a restaurant in Scottsdale for Italian food, skip the big chains and go to this family operated restaurant.  They truly care about their customers and it shows!!!!!   Thank you!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Italian for your money.  Family business with a personal flair.  A favorite, actually the favorite!!!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! I will admit upon pulling up to the restaurant I was not sure what to expect, but it was absolutely wonderful. From waiters to food, everything was perfect. All the staff was very friendly and talkative. The food was delicious and a great value as well given the serving size. Wish I was in Scottsdale more often to enjoy this cuisine!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for our first night in Scottsdale for our anniversary. We like to go to places that you can tell are not chains. This was definitely a special place. Very kitschy and a little dated but has personality. We found out our waiter was also part owner (father/son partnership). He was a delight. Loved his sense of humor. One of our favorite parts of this restaurant.  He recommended a few great meal options. We started with the calamari sauteed with tomato and garlic. The sauce was so tasty but very spicy. Our mouths were burning but we kept digging in soaking up our bread in the great fresh flavors. My husband got the spaghetti bolignese and I got the ravioli trio (lobster, butternut squash and cheese) with three different sauces. I though the butternut ravioli would have been best with the sage butter and the lobster with the cream. Although didnt taste a \"lobster\" and the sage butter had a slightly strange taste. Both meals were good. We have our favorite Italian we are comparing it to so it only got a three as the flavors were tasty but not something we'd crave to have again. We maybe given it 4 stars also if each dish wasn't $21. We felt it was a bit pricy."}
{"text":"Way over priced. The old adage of \"you get what pay\" for is definitely not applicable to La Torretta Ristorante.  Both the food and service are average. Example: their price for a bottle of $15 Castello Banfi Chianti is $50. Our bill for four was $225 before tip, with only one bottle of wine and no dessert. We tried La Torretta Ristorante based on a Groupon coupon. I can't see them being open much longer. Place was nearly empty on a Friday evening."}
{"text":"Went hear for my five year wedding anniversary. The food and the service was fantastic. The pasta was certainly homemade, the steak my husband got was incredible. The fried calamari was perfect. The only think my husband noted is that it seemed to be a long dinner - but that is part of what made it so nice, for me. We were able to enjoy bread, appetizers and our entrees, without being too full, and we were able to enjoy each others company and really good wine. I would HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last week on a living social deal.  I had the seafood special (delicous!) and my husband had the bolognese pasta.  Both our meals were wonderful and had huge portions! We will be returning to this side of town to enjoy this restaurant.  The service was outstanding.  Chaz our server was awesome and knew every detail about the menu."}
{"text":"Not sure why I don't go here every week.  Always a fabulous experience. Met 2 long time friends that were visiting on business, and I suggested La Torretta. Everything, from the staff to the food and the service, is exceptional. Their servings are fresh and plentiful.....the Veal Parmesan here is the best in the city.  Also not sure why this place isn't packed each and every night.  One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I have to say we were so looking forward to a nice experience at this restaurant...not so ! the service was just  not there :(  food was so so , for what they charge you should have a waiter that comes around & is attentive \" disappointing \" !!"}
{"text":"We went there at 7.30pm on a Saturday night 10 days ago. It was about 35% full. We had a groupon. We were very happy with our food although we only had  entree  course and a salad. The food was delicious and served hot. Service was good. I had a chicken with artichokes which was really good while my spouse had Veal Marsala which she enjoyed. Presentation was good and the vegetables were good. Salad was fresh and reasonable size. The reason I am downgrading it is due to the prices. Veal Marsala was over $30. It is at a very high end and not what I would consider reasonably priced neighborhood Italian. Our dinner with 2 main courses, one salad, one glass house wine and two coffees was $95 with tip before groupon. With desert and bottle of wine it could easily have been $150.  It has been there some time, so maybe they don't need my advice but at those prices I will not return. If you want fine dining then great but for casual neighborhood dining, it's a bust."}
{"text":"The food and service were really good; even on a Saturday night there were no long waits to be seated.  In Scottsdale that's a privilege. We'd definitely go back again."}
{"text":"We love Italian food done right!  Living in Scottsdale for the past five years, we hadn't found an Italian restaurant that we could call \"home\" until a friend recommended La Torretta . . . and now, I'm hooked!    From the moment you walk in the door, you are greeted with warm and friendly service, and it doesn't stop there.  The owners of La Torretta are on site, and everything oozes \"mom and pop\" and \"son\" . . . Compare that with the two opposing corners of busy Scottsdale Road and Frank Lloyd Wright which house two of the largest cookie-cutter chain Italian restaurants in the area.  La Torretta is hands down, head and shoulders above the rest!    The portions are hearty, but not overwhelmingly so, and they are more than willing to do things to your specifications or whim!  Big high fives for the butternut squash ravioli that melts in your mouth.  The clams oreganate (on the appetizer menu) is enough for a meal, especially when you have to lap up every drop off the sauce.   One more thing that sets La Torretta in a different class is that the owners care about their clientele and they often give back to their community by offering special menus with proceeds benefitting local charities.  In such difficult economic times, it is such a rarity to find such generosity.  Bravo to La Torretta!"}
{"text":"We love family owned Italian restaurants. Dined here while visiting Scottsdale for spring break. If you love old school Italian done really well + some fun twists (great homemade dipping sauce with the bread) and a homey, fun atmosphere, this is your place. Blow off the the national chains across the street and come here. Great marinara (no sugar), calamari is terrific, and all the classics are done well (gnocchi, chicken parm, canneloni, etc)."}
{"text":"My first impression of this place was that it looked like a restaurant that in its heyday was considered a Scottsdale gem, but has failed to change with the times and has turned into a perfect candidate for Food Network's Restaurant: Impossible. The man who seated us asked if we had a reservation - noticing there were only 2 tables taken I wanted to chuckle but realized he was dead serious. The place was rather small, which made the ruckus from the people sat at the bar a little annoying. My boyfriend and I went for dinner on a Sunday night, so I thought it might be busier than it was. All I want to know is why there are so many boobs in this place - painted on the wall, framed on the wall, on the dinner menu, and on the dessert menu. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate real art that depicts a naked body. But the giant mural on the wall seemed to me like a cheap attempt at Italian culture & authenticity.  Our waiter was very friendly and had a very extensive knowledge of the menu. We both found it off-putting however that the waiter informed us their special was stuffed veal because they didn't sell all of it the day before. If that's the case, fine, but don't tell your customers that. My boyfriend had the pasta carbonara and I had the filet mignon. While not a bad steak, I have had much much better for much much cheaper elsewhere & my vegetables were not cooked enough. My boyfriend enjoyed his pasta just fine, although the described pancetta was minuscule, which was a disappointment to him.  The women's bathroom was fairly standard. The only negative I noted was the amount of plastic framed advertisements that lined the sinks. This doesn't bother me personally, but I would think this was rather tacky for a relatively expensive Scottsdale restaurant.  The entire staff was extremely friendly and willing to help us with anything we wanted. They also boxed our leftovers for us, rather than giving us the boxes to do it ourselves, which I always take notice of and, while a small gesture, really enjoy. All in all, this is not a restaurant either my boyfriend or I would venture back to. If we are going to spend this kind of money, we expect a certain experience (because it is incredibly rare we spend this much on dinner!) and La Torretta Ristorante fell short of that experience."}
{"text":"The calamari was breaded just right but needed a little more salt. I was told of an alternate preparation after it was brought in. Would have appreciated the information when I ordered.   Had the New Zealand bass.  It was almost perfect except for the mussels which were too \"meaty\". Which can signal that it is not fresh."}
{"text":"i would like to give this restaurant a 5 star as the food was reasonably good.  I am very disappointed when I was told that the special was chilean sea bass but was served cod instead.  Although server was told that i wanted the chilean sea bass, the alaskan cod was served without telling me that they were out of sea bass. I had to question the server before he admitted to the switch. This is very disappointing for a quality restaurant."}
{"text":"First time. Great experience. Eggplant Parm was amazing. Waitstaff was very attentive."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on a groupon deal.  It was well worth it for the value!  Two entrees, a bottle of wine, 2 desserts for a reasonable price.  The veal marsala was bomb.  A good portion which I ate ridiculously fast because it was delicious.  The service was good and speedy.  The restaurant was about half full most of the time we were there.  If we didn't have the groupon deal our bill might have totaled upwards of $130.00 or more, so it can be a bit pricy, but overall I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"My family and I have always had a amazing dinner. I always get the dinner specials everything is fresh. The staff are so nice and helpful. I have always had a great waiter his name is Chaz.             thank you for making dinner out so enjoyable"}
{"text":"This review is a bit late but I really wanted to say how much I loved this place. My boyfriend took me here for Valentine's Day as we never get to eat Italian food. He made he reservations 2 weeks in advance - they were booked full for the night! Our waiter was charming and funny, was quick to take our order. We got calamari for an appetizer - it was alright, not mind blowing. For my entree, I ordered the clam linguini. Sad I didn't get a picture, the presentation was gorgeous. Clams and pasta were fresh. The portion was really really big but that's ok, I'm a college student, leftovers are awesome. My boyfriend got veal - THAT was mind blowing. I believe it was one of their Valentine's specials. The veal and carrots literally melted in your mouth, it was so good! Around the time we ordered dessert, the place got busier, so our cheesecake and bill took forever to come, but that's alright, it was a holiday. That's my only complaint. Otherwise I really enjoyed my Valentine's Day dinner!"}
{"text":"Went out on a date night tonight and this place was awesome! The food portions are huge! Service is awesome! Our server Louis was wonderful! Everyone is wonderful and welcoming there. I would definitely comes back. My only regret is that I didn't take any pictures! Lol!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Have eaten here multiple times and have never been disappointed.  The food is delicious and good size portions.  Waiter Chaz is the absolute best!!!!!! Always ask to sit in his area.  He is so personable, warm, and welcoming.  He also makes a killer cosmo-a must try!  You will not be disappointed either."}
{"text":"The lobster and butternut raviolis are very good.  Also the pistachio ice cream encrusted with pistachio nuts.  They sometimes have a prix fixe dinner with good value, otherwise it is somewhat pricey, but very good"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this review needed to be made. My family (6 total) decided to give La Torretta a try on Saturday evening 06/02/18. I need to preface this by saying that we have frequented many restaurants in the Scottsdale/North Phoenix area including some excellent Italian restaurants in Scottsdale. First, I wanted to say that overall the food was ok, but certainly not great (ie-Linguine with Clams=good, Lasagna=ok, Chicken Parmesean= ok (flavor good but tough), Clams Oreganata=poor, Salmon=poor (under-cooked).   The service was extremely poor. Our server (Server ID 6) was very rude and condescending to us. I asked him for some tabasco for the Clams and he proceeded to say \"this is an Italian restaurant and we don'carry things like ketchup and tabasco.\" My wife asked him how the Chicken Parmesean was breaded and said \"Italian food is dipped in egg and not breaded...\" with a very arrogant, condescending tone. Another time as he was walking by I asked him another question and he looked exasperated and rolled his eyes. I wasn't sure if he was just having a bad day, or if this is just how he treats his customers. The good news for this Italian-American that grew eating great food, is I know there are many other fine restaurant options in the area."}
{"text":"I just ate there last night and I have to say the food was terrible. We ordered Ossobuco--$41, and Escolar( a fish)-- $36.  They were the specials so we were hopeful, but everything was poorly presented and very salty. It was very disappointing especially since it was so expensive. Our waiter, Chaz was great, but the food was really a letdown."}
{"text":"Our dinner tonight was spectacular !!! Our waiter was so friendly and polite and made us feel very welcome . The chef was very accommodating with gluten allergies. I highly recommend the gluten free eggplant parmigiana !! It was the best I have ever had !! My husband enjoyed his veal dinner as well. The calamari he had as an appetizer was excellent!!"}
{"text":"I've been to La Torretta a few times and they have definitely made a fan out of me. You have to call ahead a few days if you want it, but I ordered the Ossobuco. Fantastic!! The meat was melt in your mouth, fall off the bone, savory goodness. All the flavors were there and you can tell they make everything fresh. No pre made frozen stuff here. The Chicken Alfredo is another favorite of mine here. The bread is always fresh and has that perfect crispy crust. I've met the owner, he's a really personable guy and great with customers, he definitely knows what service is all about!  The people crying about price on Yelp, #1 this is North Scottsdale, #2 you get what you pay for. This isn't some commercialized generic Italian restaurant, it's home made, fresh, authentic Italian food.   If I could make one suggestion it would be to lighten up the place a bit and maybe look at modernizing the decor. Other than that, they still get 5 stars from me for amazing food and great service!  Go check out La Torretta!!"}
{"text":"A friend from work recommended this place for a business dinner. What an unexpected find. Incredible service, well poured cocktails, impressive wine list and yes, incredible entrees, especially the specials. Every meal brought to the table was noteworthy! Please note, the place is not elegant but rather old school Italian in comfy booths. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Food not that good overpriced. My Calmari was very tough must have been old. Sauce was good Skimpy salad.  Service not that good. Will not go back, very dissapointing, and the place was empty."}
{"text":"I'm not one to post reviews but the wait staff here was so outstanding I had to!  Our waiter was very outgoing and helpful as was the host.  Food was delicious and very reasonably priced.   Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"5 stars! This place nails it. Greeted immediately by our server at the door and given our choice of table or booth. He was knowledgeable, friendly, courteous and attentive. Extremely professional. Bread, salad and main course we're top notch. Presentation, awesome. Cannoli's are filled fresh on order. We are recent transplants from New York and these guys nail it! I feel sorry for the reviewers that recommend the chain across the street, for you do not know what good food and service is about. Now, if I could just find some good pizza out here..."}
{"text":"I agree with a previous review about the decor/service of this restaurant... it's outdated!  Before I get to that, let me provide you with a little background.  My Husband, Grandma, and I recently went out to dinner here as we had a groupon deal and we were celebrating my Husband and I's Anniversary.  I made a reservation, which clearly wasn't necessary, but it was required when we walked in the door (weird).  After being seated the host introduced himself as our waiter and proceeded to be extra sarcastic to my Grandma, which resulted in some awkward conversation that made me want to shoot myself.  That turned me off right then and there.  Once we FINALLY got past the weirdness, we ordered and were given bread and our drinks.  The rolls were my favorite part!  They rocked my world!  The food took awhile, but when it finally got to us it was pretty good.  Nothing mind blowing, but overall a good quality Italian meal.  So, I left La Torretta feeling like with so many good Italian restaurants in town I probably won't go back to this one.  The prices were crazy expensive, even with a coupon.  For that reason alone and the outdated decor and weird waiter, I don't think we will return."}
{"text":"This is one of the places that locals go to and enjoy it while the tourist stick with the chains. We went there based on a recommendation and it was a great experience. These are one of those places where you can walk in and simply order the daily specials while you review the menu and think about what you might have when there are no specials. I ordered their Halibut special which was unbelievable, it was a large piece of halibut perfectly grilled will a lite crusting and slid under the broiler, it was accompanied with two large crab-meat stuffed raviolis and grilled vegetables. Overall the experience was great and will definitely be returning when I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly, and a nice treat.  Food is homemade with a great blend of flavors.  next I am in town i will stop here."}
{"text":"Best drink chemist. Great seafood fettacini. Wow. The owner knows his wine AND GREAT VALUE!  Wonderful meal and I am now a regular!!!!"}
{"text":"This has nothing to do with food or service. All was OK.   The decor is older but well kept and clean.  The painting on the wall is absurd! Probably 8 feet high and 12 feet wide! Naked overweight lady, yes naked, with several naked little boys flying around her with stupid wings! I watched as two parties were seated. The woman ran for the side of the table not to face the lady's gentiles. Crazy! Can't go there with friends, can't go with children, can't go with parents. Without a doubt the dumbest thing I've ever seen in a restaurant. This painting is the focal point of the entire evening!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst experience.   The food was awful as was the service and server. We purchased coupons from Groupon and I wish we had our money back.  Don't make the same mistake we did"}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better service. We went here for my wife's birthday based on a deal we found on travelzoo. The owner right away gave my wife a free drink worth $30. Throughout the rest of the night out waiter took extra special care of us. My wife even went as far as letting him pick her dinner for her. Every bit of the food we ordered was amazingly good and we could tell it was home cooked. No chain food here. I had one of the specials, fresh fish from Hawaii and it never tasted so good. The soups taste just like something my grandma would have made."}
{"text":"Bar tender is very nice.  Meatballs and Caesar salad were great.  Crab cake was good but needed a dipping sauce or something.  Escargot was oily add needed more garlic."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant 3 stars because it is family owned and I like supporting local businesses, and because the food is decent.  Upon entering the restaurant, you get a whiff of a funny odor, smell.  The place is quite old, outdated and it may be from the old dirty looking carpeting.  The service was good. We ordered two pasta entrées.  Each entrée was huge but a little overpriced in my opinion.  The chicken was slightly over cooked and not tender.  Overall, just an ok dinner."}
{"text":"La Torretta came highly recommended. After a travel and work training all in one day, by the evening, our team were all exhausted!! Our waiter, I'm sorry I never got your name, was so accommodating. Not only was he able to separate all our ticket, he made great recommendations. Speaking of, my Salmon was fantastic. My coworkers also enjoyed all their meals, and their homemade bread, it was so good we had to ask for more.   If you are ever in North Scottsdale and looking for a relaxing Italian restaurant with excellent service, I suggest you stop by.  Until then, Cheers! ~ :p"}
{"text":"Excellent. The menu was so traditional Italian it felt like mama was cooking. Cocktails and wine pours were generous. The bread and seasoned olive oil along with the stuffed mushrooms to begin was excellent.   Eggplant parmesan was very lightly breaded and the sauce was sweet and light.  My clams and linguini was perfectly cooked al dente and the clams in a light wine sauce was superb. Its easy to over salt sauce and food with the first taste being ok and by the 4th bite you are sick of salt. Not at La Torretta. Everything was nicely spiced. The suggested dessert of lemon sorbet with mini cannolis was the perfect finish. Very refreshing. Service was excellent by Maria and the soft Italian music allowed for conversation rather than yelling at each other. We couldn't ask for a nicer evening and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful.  Wonderfully comfortable place, we sat at the bar and enjoyed a signature cocktail before dinner.   For dinner, I had the Ceasar salad and then Spaghetti with a meatball and sausage. If only my stomach could have been bigger. I didn't get to sample my dining partners lasagne, nor his house salad. Both plates were gone before I could look up from my own food and ask.  I had half of my dinner packaged up to go, saving just enough room for the sweet and light tiramisu and a hot cup of coffee.  I've lived in Scottsdale for 10 years, driving past this place, never realizing what I was missing! I'll be back to try everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food!  Excellent service!  Felt like we were part of the family!  My husband had the chicken with prosciutto and loved it! Chaz was our server and he was great!"}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic made from scratch Italian. A nice ambience with enjoyable background music. My new favorite!"}
{"text":"Great food and great staff. Great for a quick lunch, a relaxing drink, or a late night feast.   I love the staffs ability to modify the menu to your desire/liking. Never a dull moment."}
{"text":"I've driven past La Torretta hundreds of times. We were starving and everything was booked solid but they had a table right away. Excellent Italian food! We had the Carbonara. It was deliciously creamy and perfectly al dente. The herb and oil served with warm crusty bread was addictive. We also had the crab stuffed mushrooms, caprese salad and chocolate lava cake for dessert. Everything was top notch. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, wine and service. The recommendations by the waiter were well appreciated as they helped guide our decisions. The food was very tasteful as he described. Baked clams with crunch topping that are delicious but not filling followed by a chicken formaggio and spicy wine tomato sauce and eggplant sided with alfredo penne hit the spot. And topping it with a delicious creme brûlée was the right choice. I will come here many times over assuming it's always that good."}
{"text":"The location of this Italian restaurant is interesting being directly across the street from Maggianos. You can sit at the intersection and see both in view. Which do you choose? Well don't t\"judge a book by its cover\" and check this place out :)  The food: The entrees = delicious!  I had a four cheese chicken (the name doesnt give much justice) It's basically a [giant] chicken breast stuffed with 4 different cheeses, with an out-of-this-world mushroom demi-glaze sauce. So good (and I dont even like mushrooms)! My bf ordered the veal marsala, also very delicious, claiming it is one of the best hes had.   Service: The staff is great! Very attentive, comedic and extremely knowledgeable of the menu.   Atmosphere: Has a romantic/ cozy feel. White table cloth. Light italian music playing and dimmer lighting. Great for a date/ anniversary/ etc :) THey have unique decor; including a large wall mural that is definitely an unavoidable topic of conversation.   Price: Fairly expensive but worth it for the quality of the food and service.  Muchhh better than any chain italian restaurant, including Maggianos!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing food, but excellent staff. We chose this restaurant because of the fairly good ratings on Yelp and it was one of the recommended restaurants from our hotel. However with all the dishes we tried (it was a party of six) only the mushroom ravioli was fine. The other dishes were bland and the sea bass was way too saucy. Given the price of the food, we expected way more than what we got. Only saving grace was that the waiter and staff are very nice."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Italian restaurant. Warm, professional service, an extensive menu, good wine list. Most of the pastas are house made,as are the desserts. Bread is warm, with a lovely olive oil and herb dipping sauce. We've enjoyed intimate dinners here and entertained larger groups and La Toretta has never disappointed.  I'm really surprised by the reviews that say the servings are skimpy-- I've never been able to finish my meal and take the rest home for leftovers. As for pricing, I feel they are fairly priced for what you get. We found excellent wines for under $40/bottle. Entrees are $20s to $30s. Osso Bucco, when they have it as a special, is the best I've ever had. Tonight i Had a mixed seafood special with shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari, and halibut in a tomato basil sauce over linguini. OMG, is was delicious!  Everyone's entitled to their opinion but mine is at La Toretta is a Scottsdale gem!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this restaurant I don't know how many times, and never stopped.  Great atmosphere, impressive servings (my veal dish plate was HUGE) and the food was excellent. We will definitely go back again!  Thanks to Maria our server....she made us feel welcome and was the best! They didn't have the Osso Bucco when I went but I hear it's one of their signature dishes.  Yes, it's a bit pricey but if you have the money to lay down, I do suggest this laid back, calm atmosphere Italian gem in Scottsdale. Unlike so many Scottsdale restaurants on a Friday night, we were sat right away and weren't rushed to get through our meal and leave.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Tucked into a corner behind shrubs and trees on the corner of Framk Lloyd Wright and Scottsdale Roads is this authentic gem of a restaurant.  We were able to make reservations on line and parking was ample outside the door. The ambiance is lovely with starched table clothes and Italian artwork on the walls.  Our window booth was comfortable and spacious. Our waiter Mike was phenomenal with his attention, timing and recommendations.  No detail was overlooked. After wine we enjoyed a raspberry gorgonzola salad with warm rolls dipped in warm oil.  My butternut squash was my delectable choice and my husband selected penne with Italian ham in a cream sauce.  We wished we could savor those flavors again and again -- and again. It was a delightful encounter to have the owner make a short visit to our table. This was a superb experience at every level and we WILL be back."}
{"text":"Great meal with great service. Two of our party had the 4 cheese chicken. It was outstanding. The other two had ravioli dishes that were equally good.   Highly recommend this place for any special occasion"}
{"text":"For starters we got the fried calamari.  I like that they give you plenty of marinara sauce in a gravy boat but overall the dish was kind of bland.  Maybe the sauce or batter needed more seasoning?  I tried the bolognese and berry spring salad.  The salad was good..  Bolognese was pretty good as well.  I think it would have been better with red pepper flakes - the waiter said he'd bring both the pepper flakes and parmesan and just brought the cheese.   Dinner took a really long time.  The restaurant was only half full so I don't know if they do this on purpose?  Anyway, its a good deal with the Groupon but I think I'll try other things on the menu next time."}
{"text":"We've come here a few times and the food has been uniformly good.  The pasta, chicken and beef dishes are all prepared fresh and the wait staff is very helpful.   They are many fine dining places in the north valley, but  La Torretta would be on our short list.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic, romantic.  Look past the dated decor and enjoy the scrumptious authentic Italian food and attentive service.  Like Italy, not like the \"chain\" Italian fare.  Tasty, creative Italian size (not monster US size) portions.  Had a terrific New Year's Eve early dinner for a second year in a row.  We had the Chilean sea bass special with capers and crab filled ravioli and the eggplant Parmesan which were both terrific.  Accompanied by excellent capresse salad, Sangiovese red wine, and wonderful tiramisu with cappuccino's to finish. The best slice of Italy in the Valley."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian restaurant. Service was a little slow but it was well worth the wait. I agree with other reviews that you could just imagine grandma in the back cooking. Menu is pricey but well worth it. Wife had lasagna and honestly it was so big a family of 4 could have split it. I had the spinach cannelloni and it was very good and easily could have been split too."}
{"text":"I had the chicken Marsala. It was one of the best I've had. The sauce was light and was used sparingly. It came with a lot of mushrooms which i like."}
{"text":"Cheesy, outdated decor, sky high prices with service that does not match, so so food. Went here on a recommendation and because they have home made gluten free pasta. Sorry we did. Our server was very proud of the fact that he knew we were gluten free and knew how to take care of us. I reminded him again when salads were ordered. Mine came with a breadlike object on top and when questioned, he said, it's a cracker stick, like that was okay. When I picked up the bowl and handed it back to him, he started to remove the crumbly stick, like that would now make my contaminated salad gluten free. Then, the crumbs fell into my daugher's Caprese salad, so both had to be reordered. My daughter's dish was not correct, nor was her pasta side, so they remade the pasta. Gluten free pasta cannot be al dente, but this was. I found a piece of non gluten free pasta mixed in with mine, leading me to suspect they make the gluten free with the regular pasta. Dirty dishes were not removed in a timely manner nor were water glasses filled. Just an odd, outdated place. Felt like I was back in Jersey, without the good food."}
{"text":"Ok, so the paintings on the walls and ceiling are a bit hokey. but dang the food makes up for it. Went with three friends/colleagues during a dinner break and we had a blast. Our waiter was friendly and funny. We drank lots of wine and had a three course dinner. Dont remember what anyone else got since I had the special of ossobuco and could not see anything over my plate. It was HUGE! Think everyone at the restaurant was jealous of my heaping plate. Think that lasted for three more meals! Dont take me wrong, its not about quantity vs quality here (it aint no cheesecake factory thank god, yuck!) but they do not skimp on either. This place came recommended from our taxi driver and concierge."}
{"text":"I am updating my review based upon the fact that after the phone call there were multiple attempts to reach out to me concerning communication. Although there were no problems making the reservations at an alternate restaurant following my attempt with la torreta, I will definitely acknowledge  the fact that technology is not perfect and something could have happened with the connection. Due to ownership reaching out to me id like to post this review pending a visit to this restaurant at some point in the future."}
{"text":"I ordered a Caesar salad and Bolognese with meatball and sausage.. Fantastic! I've not had authentic Salciccia since living in Naples and the three-meat meatball was outstanding. All homemade including the spaghetti.  The service was excellent.. friendly and attentive to my needs. I don't mind waiting a few minutes longer for a meal when the food arrives fresh and homemade.. A great dining experience."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant. Great service, quiet, peaceful, and relaxing atmosphere. Easy parking right in front. Food is fresh with high quality ingredients and the owner is typically on site."}
{"text":"The staff at La Torretta are second to none. The eggplant was spectacular, and I highly recommend the gnocchi. Romantic and classy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Waiter was great. Gnocchi was good. Ravioli was ok. Bread was really good. Dessert menu looked good, but didn't try it since we were too full"}
{"text":"Loved that on New Years Eve there was no preset menu and reasonable reservation times available. Our server was also the owners son and manager. I knew because I had read a little bit before making the reservation and recognized his name. He was very pleasant and we enjoyed the personality. We weren't concerned with things taking a little time but it would seem we were the last reservation at 8pm because it began to clear out before we got entrees. Lights were being turned off in various areas making it clear they were closing. We still had half a glass of wine and were being asked because the chef wanted to know, if we were interested in dessert and he was closing the kitchen. It was more than a little off putting considering it was New Years Eve.  We started with the crab stuffed mushrooms. Weird presentation! Raw, chilled cucumber slices and tomato wedges around the plate with raw shaved carrot in the center. The mushrooms are served with a hot savory sauce over them so this just killed it and was really strange. My friend had the chilean sea bass special and it wasn't good, she picked at it and is not one to make a fuss. I had veal picatta, it was just ok.  Both of us had the field green salad with gorgonzola and berries. The berries were mushy and this salad just looked terrible.  It's clear that something's off when the manager is waiting tables. There's no host but an older gentlemen eventually greeted us. Later found out that was our servers dad, the owner.  Other servers in the restaurant looked disheveled and not put together at all. This restaurant needs a rescue because it's a great location and you can tell the son is running ragged just trying to be everything."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to dine at La Torretta because we had a groupon.  We had a 5:30 reservation which wasn't really needed as the place was quite empty.  We were seated right away and Darius (son of the owner) came to our table to greet us.  He could not have been more pleasant.   We started out with a glass of wine and some awesomely warm and soft dinner rolls with a sun-dried tomato dipping oil.  Salads are not included with your dinner so we decided not to order any.  For my dinner, I had the 4 cheese chicken which was out of this world.  I asked for a side of pasta so they gave me penne instead of potatoes.  It also came with some delicious steamed vegetables.  The portion was so large that I ate some of the leftovers for lunch today and there is enough left for another lunch.  My husband had the lasagna which he said was equally delicious.  It looked huge to me but, because he hadn't eaten lunch that day, he ate the whole thing.  I couldn't have.  Here's something awesome......Darius came back to check on us and asked if we wanted a 1/2 glass of wine to finish up our dinner with.  To me, that's class!  We only intended to order one glass each but to be able to get 1/2 glass, was the best!!    Now, I'm quite certain that my dinner was not very healthy but it was awesome.  I'm going to give this place 4 stars because of two things:  1.  A small salad should come with their meals and 2.  It was difficult to find any healthy options on the menu.  Yes, I know that was my choice to dine there and I usually try to chose healthier options but unless I wanted either a steak or salmon it was difficult to find something without a cream sauce.  In their defense, Darius did mention that they could make anything you wanted, even if it wasn't on the menu, just ask.  We were too full for dessert and we don't normally order dessert anyway.  Our bill came to $85 before using our groupon.  So here is the icing on the cake.......Darius handed us a $20 gift certificate to use upon a return visit.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We stopped in for an early dinner. Great food, atmosphere and service. Fabulous Caesar. I had veal piccata....he had veal parmigiana...both great. Took half of each home. Price points good. What more could you ask?"}
{"text":"The food made me feel like I was in Purgatory.  This restaurant is older and dated looking. The decor is perhaps entertaining. They have a cut away ceiling that looks like an artificial sky. Unless you are blind you will view a very large mural of a naked woman with nude cherubs flying above her and other various Italian artworks and Portraits.   As soon as I tasted the bread and seasoned oil I became uncertain about how dinner would be. The bread tasted like that frozen bread dough that comes in a can and the extra virgin olive oil was oddly flavorless.  Really I don't need to describe my husband's Florentine Cannelloni too much because if you take the time to view the photo you can see it looks like a coyote took a dump on the plate. The dump part was actually dried up crushed meatballs and other God knows what else. I was told by my husband that the inside of the cannelloni's were awful. My husband just kept saying,\"not good\" \"not good\". I did taste one of the gnocchi on his plate. It was much firmer than I was expecting and was a very chewy lump of dough that was covered with a mushroomy tasting paste that was just reminded me of the paste  that came in the plastic tub you used in elementary school but it was mushroom flavored paste.  The actual on-line menu differs from the menu at the restaurant. I like Sun Fish and was expecting to order it but I noticed it wasn't on the menu so I went with the Salmon Francesca. I didn't expect the best quality fish since this isn't a fish place but I was shooting for OK since it was $23.99. At that price point IT SHOULD BE OK!  I took a bite of the fish and tasted a very overpowering sour tangy garlicy sauce. The lemon butter, white wine, caper sauce was so strong in flavor I actually couldn't taste the fish at all until the third bite. Then I knew why the sauce was so strong. The fish had that off taste. It wasn't spoiled but it was that off taste like when you purchase fish from Fry's or Safeway kind of taste. I couldn't eat it after the third bite. The vegetables on the plate were OK and the the Italian Potato was tasty but would have been better if the cheese wasn't dried out and crunchy on it.  Our waiter was extremely friendly and entertaining. I considered giving this place another star just because of the waiter. Before I knew how the fish was our waiter did ask us how the food was and I did tell him about the sauce.  He said that if we came back they could do the dish different for me.    Good Luck!  If you give this place a try you should use the coupon on their website or one of the other various discounts they offer.  1.5 stars"}
{"text":"We had bough a groupon for this place and wow it was such a great buy! I went with my husband and we were both amazed at the food, atmosphere and great service.   Darius was our server and made everything great! He was very knowledgeable and created a laid back atmosphere to enjoy a romantic evening out.  Both of our dishes were delish, I had the Linguini Lucina (linguini and calamari) and he had the Pork Saltimbocca (pork prosciutto and cream cheese with penne pasta)   I cant wait to return and would recommend any one to try it out :)"}
{"text":"A classic Italian-American throwback that smacks of the 'rat pack' and New Jersey.  All of the classic dishes are present as well as the all of the traditional cliches.  Looking for the typical dishes?  Come here and bypass the corporate Maggiano's across the street."}
{"text":"Expensive, but great food.  I got lucky with dinner for two and a bottle of wine through Groupon, but what they didn't say was it was about $20 towards a bottle of wine, and only 3 were close to that price.  Food was excellent for the Groupon price, and service was great!"}
{"text":"5 star means 5 star. Valentines dinner with my wife. She had the chicken parm and I had eggplant parm. Fantastic meal, appetizers  and entrees.   Service was awesome. Great bar selection.   I'm coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm always up for trying some handmade Italian food, and I went to La Torretta for the first time. The north Scottsdale spot is pretty from the outside, with twinkly lights adorning the exterior of the restaurant.  Inside, the spot is really nice, with big murals of Renaissance-style figures covering the walls. Tables are covered in linens, and there's a lounge-y bar area with a single TV in the corner.  Both my companion and I noticed the place was pretty quiet despite being full of people-maybe it's because it gives off a romantic vibe. There was some Frank Sinatra music playing in the background, though, which was a nice touch.  After a great meal a week before at Tutti Santi, La Toretta had a lot to live up to. My first impression of the food was the bread, which was ultra-crusty small pieces of a baguette served with packages of butter. It didn't taste super-fresh, and for how classy the atmosphere was, the foil packages of butter was a turn-off.  We ordered the Mozzarella Caprese and Bruschetta ($9.99), one of my favorite dishes, to start. The portion for the price took me aback, considering I had seen much more generous plates at other spots. To get only two small pieces of mozzarella was sort of shocking, and my favorite part of the dish was the bruschetta. If I go back to La Torretta, I would try to order a full appetizer of bruschetta (it's not on the menu, but maybe they'd do it.) The bread had an amazing flavor and texture to it because the heaping hunks of tomatoes perfectly saturated the bread.  My entree was by far my favorite part of the meal. It was the huge Tortellini con Ricotta ($18.99), which came in a cream sauce covered with mushrooms and peas. The dish was gigantic-I could only eat half of it-and every bite of the tri-colored pasta was delicious. I really, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you go.  My dining partner got the Ravioli Farcitti dell'Aragosta ($25.99), which was the lobster ravioli pictured here. He said it was great.  Finally, there was the Tiramisu ($8.95). It was served with whipped cream on the side, which I found odd,  and topped with strawberries. It was super-cold in the center and didn't have a strong coffee taste, but I did enjoy the cream part. The dessert just wasn't as traditional as I would have liked-I like a ton of espresso soaking the ladyfingers, but it tasted good and was served up generously.  Maybe it's because the place was pretty busy, but we noticed the service from our bartender/server was pretty slow. It could have just been because the spot was going for a laid-back vibe, but just be prepared to take your time throughout the meal if you go.  There are definitely some tweaks I'd make to create a better experience at La Torretta, but I would go back for the atmosphere and that amazing tortellini dish."}
{"text":"Eloquent restaurant.  Nice bar as well when you walk in.  Food was definitely true Italian but the portions are a little small for the price.  Parmesan eggplant was juicy and very flavorful.  Our server was very nice (not Italian) and did everything to make a nice dining experience.  Would go back again."}
{"text":"Our dinner was excellent. The waiter was so friendly and funny. He made you feel like you want to come back. They serve dinner rolls with a delicious oil and seasoning to dip it in. The ceasar salad was very good. Husband had Chicken parmigiana and it was big enough for 2 people. I had cheese ravioli was very tasty also enough to share. It is family owned . I would definitely  try them out."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out last night. We have been driving by this place for years and never tried it. I'm so glad that we did. We had to wait a bit for a table even with a res but it gave us a chance to review the menu. Our waiter was interesting but he was hilarious and overall knowledgable and entertaining. We started with toasted ravioli which was tasty. I had the the minestrone soup as well. Probably the best minestrone I've ever had! I could eat that every day. I didn't see a particular item on the menu that I wanted which was just plain gnocchi with tomato cream sauce. The waiter said the kitchen could prepare it with no problem! The gnocchi came out perfectly cooked. I wish we were able to try one of their many desserts but we were so full. Great place for great italian! Skip the chain across the street and try this little place out! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I feel bad that a Baby Cow died in vain. TG we had a Localdines certificate because if we had paid full price, I would be totally peed off.  Attended the Scottsdale Philharmonic concert Sunday afternoon  just down the street, & as La Torretta was conveniently located & as DH had been longing to try it for over a year & as we had certificate...    Arrived a little early for our reservation (Open Table) but they seated us immediately, at 6 pm, as only about 3 tables were occupied. First impression: dated. Cheesy 80's goomba, which can be kind of cool. Ceiling has this \"broken\" area so it's supposed to look like an old ruin & you are looking up out an ancient building to the sky. There is a mural on the wall of a naked woman (Venus?) with ornery little cherubs buzzing around her. It was done by an extraordinarily talented artist---the skin tones glow, but still she is in All Her Glory, so I'd feel funny with a younger child in tow. Mostly, I was unimpressed by the cleanliness.  Too much Restaurant Impossible? The carpet was really grimy & I could see thick layers of dust of the back edges of the chairs & supports, & also on the top of the velvet drapes. Told DH NOT to go near the drapes during dinner as I didn't want that crap sifting down on my food!  Ordered wine---very happy with our selections & the prices per glass were reasonable. The wine was little slow to come out, but glassware sparkling clean. Our server recited the specials & my eyes lit up when she mentioned Osso Buco. I LOVE Osso Buco. Fortunately, as I contemplated that, another young man came with basket of bread & oil. One bite of dry, tasteless roll & equally tasteless oil & I became hesitant to spend $43 on the veal shanks. Oil served in a gravy boat with large spoon---very odd. If you poured oil from boat, you got none of the herbs and whatever in it---but the spoon was so large that to take it out of the gravy boat you had to tilt it and lose half the contents. It didn't matter---it had no flavor at all, despite lots of bits & pieces floating in it. I decided to go with the Gorgonzola salad with strawberry vinaigrette & Cannelloni Fiorentino & Gnocchi. Kind of a weird, carb-heavy combo, but description of the cannelloni sounded delicious. DH also got the salad & Pollo Farcito Formaggio Quattro.    Well, our salads finally arrived about 6.37.  (Yes, by this time I am checking my watch.)  Admittedly, dining room starting to fill up &  appeared our server was only one working, but really? I almost gagged on first bite---so incredibly sweet. But as I started to get the tart, pungent gorgonzola along with the sweet vinaigrette, it was delicious. Also included blackberries & raspberries & candied pecans & greens VERY fresh, so ended up being very good. Took our time, but how long can you linger over a salad?  Probably finished about 6.50. Server did stop in for a moment & we ordered another round of wine. Thank goodness, because our entrees finally appeared---I kid you not---at 7.17 pm. So the runner pops them down before us & I am looking at my plate & not feeling good about this. Looked like two cannelloni just visible under a layer of something---it looked like TVP (texturized vegetable protein). Tasted like it too---tasted like nothing.  There was no seasoning, no depth of flavor--nada. The chicken filling inside was the consistency of baby food and again, no seasoning. I won't say it was disgusting---it was just flavorless. It WAS hot, I can say that! The gnocchi---and I find it hard to believe they were house-made, were actually cooked well, but again, no flavor, despite large pieces of mushrooms tossed in the bland cream sauce.  The veggies were cooked tender-crisp, but again---no seasoning. DH said his chicken was well cooked (I had a taste and I thought it was a little overcooked) but only a whisper of the sweet, rich flavor of marsala. Even rosemary potatoes that accompanied---this is kind of gross, but DH got a couple of hard needles of rosemary caught between his teeth & when he wiggled them out & then chewed them, said it was like eating straw. Obviously, not using fresh herbs in the kitchen & considering even the dried had no flavor, assume it was old, bulk stuff. Potatoes though, were hot & steamy & cooked very nicely.  Server stopped by, looked at my plate & said \"No parmesan?\"  I told her I had not been offered any.  So she whisked away & came back & generously sprinkled shredded parmesan on my dish. Some flavor now? No.  Was that dryish, plastic parm they sell in giant bags from food services. Ugh.  Disheartened, we gave up and had the busboy box remainders, hoping I could \"flavor up\" at home. Waited 18 minutes for server to notice we were ready for our bill. Another 9 minutes to get the credit receipt.  Really?  I feel bad because DH was really looking forward to this restaurant.  What a let-down. Really surprised at all the positive reviews, but then I see Yelp filtered all the 1 & 2 star.  Hmmm.   Cannot recommend."}
{"text":"Needed to be in for the evening, so we placed a delivery order using Yelp's Eat24 app. Two entrees and an appetizer. Got a call a while later from customer service at Eat24 that the restaurant wouldn't take the order because they were too busy.  Do not order delivery. Might be a fine place to go sit down and eat, but they shouldn't take online deliveries/take-out if its not their thing. Never heard of a restaurant declining an order before (especially a $110 one)."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short  Great place to bring grand pa and grand ma. Service is slow, the food is outdated, the furniture needs to be replaced. I felt like I was at a old folks home.   They gave 1 loaf of bread and never came by for a refill.   I wouldn't come back even if the food was free"}
{"text":"I just had a very pleasant lunch here today.  I especially enjoyed my desert. I like tiramisu and I could and did have tiramisu three times in one week.  This one is one of the best I've ever had, very moist and not too sweet. In fact I think I swallowed the whole thing in five seconds. It was a large piece of cake but it was so good, I didn't give any chance for my friend to have a bite as I quickly ate the whole thing so fast.  The server confirmed it is homemade!  No wonder why it was so good.  Lunch was very good too. More so than I anticipated. i expected somehow good for its location and price, but didn't think it was that good. I had veal and my friend had salmon. They both were very good.  I like the inside the decoration too. It may be a bit outdated but I still liked it.  It wasn't crowded at all during today's lunch, mostly semi-retired enjoying leisurely lunch during rainy Friday.  Too bad others don't know how good the food is here."}
{"text":"Overall we liked this place. It was quiet, service was very good and food was good. My complaint is the pricing. Food as in the low $20's, which seems a bit high for the atmosphere and food. My major issue was the pricing on the wine. They served one of my favorite bottles, which typically goes for $50-$65, but this place was asking $85.   The pasta was fresh and very tender, and I very much enjoyed the ravioli. For 2 dinners, bottle of wine and desert, I feel like we could have done much better for $140."}
{"text":"I tried this place because they were promoting the place with Groupon. We were seated right the way but then all the table after us ordered before we did. We waited for a very long time until someone come to our table and take our order. The food was decent but I wouldn't have visited if not for a Groupon deal."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for Christmas Eve dinner.  It was fabulous.  The atmosphere and staff were warm and welcoming.  Food was delicious.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a nice, upscale Italian restaurant this might be where you want to go.   The service was excellent and the food came out of the kitchen very quickly, which was great because I was starving.   Be sure to come here prepared to spend a lot. Even with a $25 off coupon, our bill was quite high. You may want to reserve this place for special occasions but I was very happy that I got to try it!  Things my family tried: I had salmon ala vodka, which was sliced salmon on top of penne in vodka sauce. There was a very generous amount of salmon and it was cooked very well. My family ended up playing musical plates so my mom and grandmother got to try this as well and it ended up being all gone by the end. My stepdad at linguine with white clam sauce. He thought there could have been a few more clams but overall said it tied with a place back in Jersey for his favorite restaurant to have this dish. My mother had a ravioli sampler, which had cheese, lobster, and butternut squash ravioli. She said she enjoyed the butternut squash the best. I think I would have too but the portion wasn't large enough for me to get to try any leftovers. My grandma had a veal dish that was the special for the night. I personally thought it was good but tasted like pot roast. If you are in the mood for pot roast, go with this!---it did happen to be cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I recently visited La Torretta while spending the weekend in Scottsdale.  Service here is great, but everything else about this restaurant is horrible.  We arrived at 9pm for our dinner reservation there were 4 other tables in the restaurant. We were seated promptly. Our waiter was attentive, comical, and polite.  We opted out of appetizers and went straight for entrees. Our food took forever to arrive. We waited about 40 mins for our dinner to arrive. I ordered the halibut special which came with a lemon artichoke/capers sauce with a side of ravioli, and steamed veggies. The halibut was a bit dry and the sauce was not good. It tasted like it came from a can. We also ordered the Lasagna al Saltimbocca. The description reads (Baked hand made wide ribbon pasta with ragu of wild mushrooms, veal and prosciutto) Regrettably, it ended up being regular lasagna with ground beef. There were no mushrooms, no veal, and no prosciutto.   The worst part of the dining experience was the bill. The halibut was $35 and the lasagna was $22. Frankly, you can get better Italian food at Maggiano's. The great service doesn't justify the overpriced food. Don't waste your hard earned cash at La Torretta."}
{"text":"I look forward to our trips to Phoenix/Scottsdale especially so my husband and I can to to La Torretta! Fine dining as it's meant to be. First of all, comfortable seating, excellent food, quality wait staff, and nice ambiance. No loud discotheque type music."}
{"text":"We tried this place last night because I bought a HomeRun deal a few months back.  We were not disappointed!  We went at 6:30 on a Saturday night.  I had made reservations, but the restaurant was not even half full.  Our server, Chas, was just great!  He gave us lots of info about the menu items and specials.  Made great recommendations and chose a great wine for me.  The food was fabulous, and because I had a hard time deciding between two dishes (a special and the buternut squash ravioli) Chas recommended that I order the special, and then he brought out a small plate of the ravioli so I could try it.  Both were amazing!  We had the chocolate ganache covered raspberry sorbet which was incredible!  Then to top it off, Chas brought us some cannoli's to bring home for our kids!  I highly recommend this restaurant.  The food and the service are top notch!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"we have found ths place outstanding.  we have attend twice on a groupon and we were fortunate enough to be served by chaz. Boh time are dishes were outstanding and chaz accomadated any thing we requested.  the fruit de mare and the osso bucco was one of the best he has tasted (bestest ever according to my husband.)  I like the idea that my dinner meal can make 2 more dinners."}
{"text":"We found this place via Groupon and have eaten here several times.  It can get busy during the main dinner hours (6:30 - 8), so be sure to call ahead of time.

Besides the Gnocchi, my fav dishes here are the Stuffed Shells and the Tortellini con Ricotta.  The Stuffed Shells are a special menu item and it isn't always available.  The rest of the menu items I've tried are pretty good as well.  The customer service here is very good.  There are a couple of fun waiters who are always smiling and cracking jokes with you....they're also attentive to your dining needs.  Overall, it's a good dining experience.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  I have to preface my review by saying this is a heavy meal.  But if that's what you are expecting from an Italian dinner you are at the right address.    Not your normal chain resturant.  This place has character. The owner has an open presence and is very proud of his establishment.    Our server, Chaz, had expert product knowledge and was able to make recommendations and minor changes to fit our taste.  He was very exacting in his delivery of the specials and articulate with out being pretentious.   Family style buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes, rich and and flavorful bruschetta were a great start to a fantastic meal.    The portion of the four cheese chicken smothered with mushroom sauce was fantastic.  The portion was huge.  My wife had to stop me from overheating.  All others in our party were pleased with their entree and commented on the quality, flavor and generous portions.    I recommend this resturant and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The section we sat in near the bar wasn't particularly clean considering the prices on the menu and the initial service was not great and that had me worried but everything was great when the food came out.  It all tasted awesome.  The cocktails were also good."}
{"text":"If your looking for great Italian food...this is the place!  Calamari to die for and the veal was unbelievable!"}
{"text":"HOME MADE EVERYTHING! Chicken Alfredo with chicken smoked in house. Certainly worth the $6 more than the chain. Sausage and meatballs all freshly make same day! Next visit I got a steak, I said what do you have. They asked me what I wanted. Went to the back and told me what looked the best, cut in house. Ribeye was amazing Prime beef and cheaper that the steakhouse down the street. For sides I mentioned a veggie, they started listing around 15 different options and said what would you like, any or all. Taking the better half there for her birthday tonight!"}
{"text":"Wow! The chef wow' me. I have a favorite Italian place. This is my new favorite Italian place. Went for my birthday last night and was really pleased. Started with a comfortable booth. I'm old, I have back issues. Thank you for booths. Then a lovely wine list. You don't know wine? Fuggetaboutit. Order a beer and move on. The fried ravioli appetizer were to die for. My husband had a shrimp Dish and this was  huge portion of prawns and seafood in a sauce that caused a flavorgasm in my mouth. I ordered my usual, Eggplant parmigiana. But this was not the usual, it was amazing. My husband doesn't eat eggplant and ate some, it's that good. The place is charming, quiet if you go early and the staff is friendly and professional yet casual. Husband said I made sex noises the whole meal. He liked it a lot. Cannoli that tasted like dreams instead of birthday cake for me. Oh yes we'll be back."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waiter didn't check on us once except for announcing to all tables in the section at once to let him know if you need anything. Food was the worst Italian we've had in Scottsdale. Decor is outdated and menu is way overpriced."}
{"text":"While visiting the area we were looking for authentic Italian food and something that we don't have in Cincinnati. I am so glad that we chose this wonderful place! The bread, dipping oil, salads, lasagna and Florentine cannelloni were out of this world! I would highly recommend this to anyone! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We dined at La Torretta again last night, and as it has been since we discovered it about two years ago, it was FANTASTIC! The food and service was impeccable. There were six of us and four had the pasta special which had jumbo prawns, rock shrimp, peas and a scrumptious cream sauce. OMG...can't wait for tonight for the leftovers. Another had the Osso Buco (also a special) which was heavenly and one had the Hawaiian Sun Fish with a sauce on the side, and they said it was wonderful. We enjoy coming to this charming place when there is a special occasion and there were two birthdays being celebrated last night. We were all so pleasantly full from the dinner and really didn't think that there would be any room for dessert, but Darius insisted that he bring out six mini Cannoli's (two had candles) and these certainly added a delightful finishing touch to a terrific evening. The staff is always so attentive and Darius, the owner, has a great sense of humor, is a good conversationalist, and truly makes us feel welcome and appreciated every time we're there. We look forward to a return visit very soon. Bill T. Phoenix"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and had a great bottle of wine and some wonderfully prepared food. Chaz did an outstanding job taking care of us. We also had their escargot and it was, buttery and bubbly."}
{"text":"My gentleman friend and I are here last night and it was wonderful.  I had the veal picatta with garlic over angel pasta.  Delicious! My date was thoroughly impressed with the food and service.  This is a great place for a date!!"}
{"text":"Food is awful, I think they unfreeze the food and try and pass it off as fresh or cooked.   Stay away."}
{"text":"Darius offered incredible service and ensured our experience was exceptional. We will definitely be returning for a delicious meal and wonderful atmosphere. I would definitely recommend to friends or family."}
{"text":"A definite gem here in Scottsdale.   It's definitely our favorite Italian restaurant in town!  We keep coming back for the food and amazing service.  We have tried all the pasta, fish, apps and salads. Our fav is their  meat sauce and cannelloni.  Don't settle for chain restaurant Italian when you can have so much better food here!!!"}
{"text":"I am from San Francisco on business in North Scottsdale, and I saw this restaurant on Groupon. I was able to purchase the groupon for $40 worth of food and drink for $20 and was very excited about it! When I got there at 7:30 on a Tuesday night, the place was pretty dead. There were about 5 tables filled out of 25 or so. An older couple came in and knew everyone, so were obvious \"regulars\", and they seemed to love the place. I ordered the White Bean Soup and the Ribeye steak with Gorgonzola sauce. The White Bean Soup was piping hot and delicious. The little bit of shredded Parmesan that melted into my spoon made the soup delectable. A waiter notified me shortly after I ordered that the ribeye was not available as the meat guy hadn't come. He substituted the porterhouse at no extra charge with the same Gorgonzola sauce that would have been on the ribeye. The steak was okay. The sauce was good, but the Gorgonzola overpowered the flavor of the steak. The steak was a little thin (hence why I'd rather have a thicker Ribeye than a thinner porterhouse). The roasted potatoes that came with the dish were delicious and the vegetables were tasty. I took 2 stars off for ambiance, not having the ribeye, and just overall satisfaction with the meal. I feel that if I had the ribeye, this might have been a 4 star."}
{"text":"We had a living social deal here plus its super close to my company's vacation condos so we just had to try it. It was delicious, 5 stars all around. Our server Chaz was friendly and and the service from everyone at the restaurant was impeccable. Very attentive, always filling our waters, but the perfect amount of also leaving us alone to enjoy the food and ambiance. We started with the sauteed calamari. I went in with every intention of ordering fried but I am so glad we chose the other preparation. It had just the right amount of spice and we absolutely loved it. We both got chicken dishes but I highly recommend the one my boyfriend ordered. Chicken with 4 cheeses is the easy way of saying it. The mushrooms that surrounded it and the perfection of the cheeses and prosciutto along with the chicken...just amazing. The prices are reasonable for what you get. The portions are large and the pasta and sauces are homemade.   If you're not sure where to go for Italian and you find yourself in the Kierland area, please do yourself a favor, don't support the chains like maggianos, head over to this local gem and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this more stars as it is family owned but I just couldn't. .  The only reason we went to this restaurant was we had a groupon for two entrees up to 25 each and a house bottle of wine.  The staff was extremely friendly, attentive and engaging.  There were a couple options with the house wine and we went with the merlot.    The food was average, portions small to average.  Im not sure if I'd come here again as the price for the quality of food isn't worth it to me.   The groupon was a bust.  It cost  $39.00 and was a \"$78\" dollar value.  Total spending on groupon plus tax tip and a bottle of water was 69.00.   The entrees we picked were 22 and 23 dollars.  Our included bottle of wine was 26 dollars. Of course I googled it.  Turned out to be  a   $3.00 bottle of wine called 3 wishes from Cali.   Quite the mark up.  Next time i'll go to whole foods and get the case for 33.00.  Groupon didn't provided much of a savings on this."}
{"text":"Chaz was our server, and he was the best thing about this restaurant. He tried everything to find a red wine that I would like but there just wasn't one that wasn't either sour or so five years ago or it was a cheap brand that I could get for eight dollars at the grocery store. Interesting that when you walk in the door there is a ton of empty \"Coppola\" bottles, but it's not on the wine menu. They really need to look to that. Coppola is a nice in between priced wine that would go with their food nicely. After my wine debacle I was hoping that I would love the food because other yelpers had reviewed this restaurant with three and four stars.  I ordered the eggplant Parm, my husband ordered veal Parm, my friends ordered the cannelloni , the pasta fagoli soup, and the linguine with clam sauce. The eggplant was mushy, the veal Parm was pretty bland although the veal was cooked nicely. The cannelloni had too much meat in the sauce over the top and the pasta visual soup although tasty with the chickpeas was over-the-top garlicky. The table agreed that the linguine with clam sauce was the best. The rolls they served were yummy and the house and Caesar salad's were good. The lemon cello was just OK, and the escargot was just OK. I think the problem is that the sauce is forgettable and the presentation using carrots, broccoli and cauliflower pieces is rather lackluster. I think because this restaurant is in Scottsdale I expected amazing homemade food with beautiful well-thought-out presentation. Instead I got my great aunt Maria's homemade family style food that you would like when you go to visit her because you love her and she worked hard to make it for you but it's not your favorite.  Anyway I'm sorry LaToretta but I won't be returning unless my friends want to go and then I'll just go to be with them and not for the food."}
{"text":"I have driven past La Torretta Ristorante more times than I can count, so on a whim one evening when I was craving some Italian food (which doesn't happen all too often) I decided to finally give this hidden spot a chance. Walking in I felt like I was being transported back to the late 1980's or the early 90's when peach and mural walls were all the rage. Place had maybe 3 tables on an early Sunday evening,   First glance, I was a little surprised by the prices they were charging but was hoping that the food would be well worth the $25.00 a plate pasta dish prices. A few take notes... The best part of the evening was their bread service and their house infused olive oil. I could have spent my evening making that my dinner thankfully they sell their oil by the jar so I know one thing is for sure, I will be back to buy a bottle of it. The not so good was my not so good linguine and clams. It tasted like they threw a couple fresh clams on top and poured a can of clams on top of the pasta. I was super bummed, I was really hoping this place was going to be my new found hidden Italian gem. Not so much. For the prices they charge the food should reflect it.   Hate to say it, but I won't be back... I love to support local businesses and the service was amazing and friendly."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!! Eaten here before and loved it! Arrived at 6 PM on Saturday night  Asked to sit at the bar and told \"No\" and a two hour wait for a table.  The bar was empty!! Lived in NYC for nine years and visit Las Vegas 4-5 times yearly.  Never had a problem eating at the bar until tonight. What restaurant can afford to have empty seats?"}
{"text":"Went there with a homerun.com certificate.  Food and service were excellent.  The wait staff paid attention, but not too much.  The food was hot and very good.  Presentation was excellent.  If you want a relaxing night out this is a great place!"}
{"text":"The best Italian in AZ! Hands down. Came for our anniversary and we couldn't have celebrated at a better place. The service was wonderful, very accommodating and had the best attitude! We will definitely be back...   The only thing it needed was to be a little darker, with all candles lit, this would have set more of a romantic tone and fit the decor and table settings better."}
{"text":"Be careful if you have a groupon. Make sure you are CLEAR. Waiter said we cud order off the whole menu and we cud apply $26 toward our wine. I asked again can we order off the whole menu and he said yes! Well when we got our bill we had to pay the difference. He said sorry. I felt duped and had to pay $65 not much  of a deal after all. Not very happy and won't be going back."}
{"text":"My friend and I were staying at a resort down the road for the weekend and came for some good Italian food. She had never been here, and I suggested the Eggplant Parmigiana that I'd had before. I got the Chicken Piccata and the lemon/caper sauce was tasty. They come with a mixed veggie side, and we both requested a substitution on the side pasta, Cappellini w/red sauce, rather than the ones noted on the menu. We were both pleased with our entrees, and as usual, the sauce for the bread is always a hit. Only negatives were that I'm not crazy about the bread rolls served before the meal, fresh and warm. They're not bad, just have had better Italian bread/rolls elsewhere. Also the red sauce needed more kick, so next time I'll order it spicy:-) The best part was our server, Chaz, who was very attentive and waited on us patiently and efficiently. He had knowledge of the food and wine when we asked questions, and made sure we had a nice dining experience. Will request him next time I'm in. (Ironically, I could have posted the same review as Julia S from 6/24/17 about the service, etc.) *I see some reviews blasting the furniture and atmosphere as being \"old,\" and the food \"outdated\"? I am old, I guess, at 65, but don't look it, and I'm very young at heart. I love the \"traditional\" Italian dishes, the booths are quite comfy, murals and artwork are beautiful, and do enjoy the quiet, relaxing atmosphere where you can actually hear each other when you talk. Those are the things that make you feel like you are enjoying a good home-cooked Italian meal in a pleasant NY restaurant, like back in the day. They serve all the favorites, along with a plethora of other delicious choices, in a very extended menu, and creative daily specials. I guess you Youngsters who want a hip, loud, crowded place, and food with a more modern twist need to go elsewhere :-)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Chef had no problem honoring special request. Tortellini Carbonara and Spaghetti with meatball and sausage were very tasty. Ended with the cheesecake which I also highly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently chose La Torretta for our date night.  The decor is old school Italian and the ambiance is nice.  I would say it would appeal to an older crowd but I personally enjoyed the unpretentious and quiet atmosphere.  A great place for quiet conversation. We had the most amazing service by the owner.  He seems like a great guy!  Friendly, helpful and willing to please.  We enjoyed some wine to accompany the delicious bread and out of this world tapenade.  The Caesar salad was light and I loved the Parmesan crisp.  For entrees we enjoyed the lasagna (very authentic and yes we've enjoyed time in Italy) as well as the gnocchi and the butternut squash ravioli-both were really good as well.  Ended the night with their twist on tiramisu. The prices are a little high so I had been hesitant to try but they fit the area and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to La Torretta ristorante to celebrate our 36th wedding anniversary. We had Chaz seat us,he made us feel welcome and explained in detail how dishes are prepared and allowed us to customize our dishes.my husband enjoyed his Australian Sea Bass and I loved my pasta Fagioli soup and chicken Genovese with capers. Chaz stopped at our table often,to see if we were needing anything. We felt like family!!and yes we love Sinatra music!"}
{"text":"The tall dark handsome and VERY funny server is fabulous...the food was DELICIOUS(I had chicken milanese...yummm....GREAT italian food"}
{"text":"Came here last night with the wife for a date night, I bought a groupon like a few others on here.  I quickly realized that this used to be the old Tomaso's which is still on Camelback.  The atmosphere is a little dated, I remember it being the same when it was Tomaso's about 10-15 years ago.  I called for reservations a few hours earlier and was able to get a 6:15 reservation.  Place was still calm then but by the time we left it was pretty packed (Friday night).  Service was good, they were helpful with picking out the entrees and we started with the caprese brochette combo salad and that was just phenomenal.  I love a good caprese to start, I ordered a combination plate of stuffed veal and gnocchi in a butter sauce.  Both were very rich and very good, veal was a little tough but very flavorful.  A few drinks and goofy pictures taken with the decor we got out of there for about $160 bucks but since I had the groupon it only cost me about $100 (I still tipped about $30).  I read a few reviews before ordering and couldn't help but notice the douche-bags that thought this place was overpriced.  Did you guys think you were going to Fazoli's?  WTF?  When your review is a few lines long only complaining about the price, you look more foolish than the restaurant.....just saying."}
{"text":"Really good experience here. To bad its so far away from my home and office. Anywho, had a business meeting at the Kierlands and took my sales director here for dinner and discussion afterward. As soon as you walk in your smell Italian. Reminded me of when I lived in New York. Took a seat and Chaz the waiter comes by and of course knows my employee. Good rapport is established and Chaz shows good product knowledge - he knows what he's doing and guides us through the menu. This seems to be a forgotten science these days with the \"order taker\" mentality of the turn and burn server of our microwave society. I digress.  We ordered the Calamari Infernalli which was sauteed in a spicy tomato sauce which was an awesome alternative to the usual bread coating. Just the right amount of spice kick - good stuff and recommended.   We both ordered Filetto Saltimbocca Del Porco as an entree. If I'm not mistaken Saltimbocca means melt in your mouth and that's exactly what it does. the pork loin is stuffed with cheese, sage and pancetta with a delicate sauce and was just awesome. Would coem back just for this again.   Great experience and nice job Chaz."}
{"text":"A taste of my grandmothers cooking. This restaurant holds a special place in my heart because it is the only authentic Italian place that cooks like my grandmother use to.  I use to come to this restaurant at least 1x week growing Up and hadn't been in 10 years. Food was better than I remember, staff was exceptional."}
{"text":"This place is what Italian food is all about.  Eat everything blindfolded because everything tastes like love and will take you to Italy on your first bite, guaranteed.  The staff and owner here are special.  They make you feel like you are coming over to Grandma's house for Sunday dinner, every time.  Come here and fall in love with the restaurant, please.  Enjoy the food and the best service in town!"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW. It's been a long time since I was as blown away by a meal the way I was last night at La Torretta. The dishes are simple, but phenomenal, the prices are reasonable and the service was great. We will definitely be back very soon to taste more of the menu."}
{"text":"I went here with my family before I met my wife and I remember enjoying the atmosphere, the service, and the food.   I called the day before to confirm our reservation for two.  Their dining room isn't huge, but every table is really comfortable.  I'm glad we were seated in a booth as this is always our preference in restaurants.  The table itself had padding on top with a white table cloth on top of that so when you rest your elbows on the table it's actually comfortable.  We just had regular waters and luckily they didn't taste like nasty Arizona tap water.  It tasted like filtered water to me which is a big plus because we have a reverse osmosis system in our house so we're very sensitive to tap water taste when eating out.  My wife ordered a Ravioli ai Funghi and I ordered Linguini with Pesto.  After placing our order, they brought us two freshly baked bread rolls with a super tasty olive oil based dipping sauce containing garlic, Italian spices (just a few fresh leaves, it looked like it could have been rosemary), tomatoes, and capers.  The olive oil wasn't a green color so I suspected it was an infused flavor like tomato basil.  We often get inspiration from restaurants with really good food so you can bet we're going to try to replicate this dipping oil in the future.  Shortly after we finished eating our free bread rolls, they brought our main courses out to us.  We were surprised our food came out so fast!  My Linguini with Pesto was really tasty (I didn't ask for anything extras like chicken or shrimp), but my wife's ravioli was out of this world.  Do you ever trade dishes with  your wife and wish you didn't have to give your plate back?  This was definitely one of those days!  The restaurant menu lists the ravioli as containing button mushrooms and shiitake mushrooms in a very light sage sauce with some vegetables.    We weren't sure about the sauce so we requested two additional side sauces: mushroom marsala and marinara.  I can safety say these two additional side sauces were not needed, but the mushroom marsala definitely complemented the flavor of this dish.  We did try it with the marinara as well, but it's too over powering for such a delicate ravioli and totally hides the mushroom flavor (this might be an option if you have a picky eater or kids, but why waste such food on them?!).  Let me tell you about the first bite into this ravioli.  If you love shiitake mushrooms like me (or mushroom in general) along with regular cheese ravioli, this will blow you away.  The explosion of flavors: shiitake, the button mushrooms, followed by the texture of the pasta holding it all together and cheese.  We went here for my wife's 30th birthday, but I'm already trying to make up an excuse for us to come back here so I can order this amazing dish and have it all to myself.  It's been a while since I had a \"food high\" when eating in a restaurant.  The first bite into this ravioli did it for me.  The ambiance of the restaurant was really romantic.  The lighting is dim and apparently we ordered at the right time as the restaurant started filling up shortly after we placed our main course order.  I thought the ceiling painted in a sky color was a nice touch (reminds me of The Venetian in Las Vegas) along with some stained glass window artwork near our table.  The music playing in the restaurant sounded like a dance club mix (played at a low volume).  This was fine with me since I'm a big fan of Tiesto and Oakenfold, but I also think that bossanova music would have been more suitable to the environment (think: Stan Getz & Joao Gilberto - Corcovado (Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars), Tom Jobin & Elis Regina - Aguas De Março, etc).  Our waiter Luiz was super friendly and very attentive to refilling our water and checking on the taste of our food.  My wife usually has to drink my water in most restaurants, but she was topped off enough times as her glass ran dry.  Our meal total was a very reasonable $53 including more than 20% tip which I added separately.  From entry to leaving, our total time in the restaurant was only 45 minutes.  Amazing.  We will be back!!!  P.S. As I hadn't been here in a few years, we were a little nervous about some of the negative reviews on Yelp and TripAdvisor.  While I could see this largely depending on the dish you order, I think this place is perfect for foodies like us who appreciate a home cooked Italian meal.  We're also curious about their squash ravioli, but I think we're both ordering the mushroom ravioli the next time we stop by.  Service was perfect, food was amazing, ambiance was great...what else do you need?  You can talk to each other without yelling unlike some popular restaurants in Kierland (which also have good food, but you can hardly hear each other)."}
{"text":"Drove down from AJ for Dinner  Had eggplant and calamari pasta both excellent  Caesar Salad was one of the best I had  Service , owner and Staff very attentive and welcoming . The red sauce is off the Hook Delicious . Romantic atmosphere , incredible specials Huge Four Cheese stuffed Veal Chop , Veal Shank Osso  buco , Rack of Lamb just to name a few . The escargot appetizer was incredible !!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is ok, but nothing special.   The decor was really dated and cheesy.  But worst of all, the place was just rundown and dirty!  There was some sort of food dried and stuck on our booth.  The other booth was ripped and falling apart.  The carpet had a large rip going through most of the dining room.  Another reviewer characterized this place as being like a retirement home.  It definitely has that vibe.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Um, wow. Found this place on Groupon and decided to try it out. The food was amazing! Probably the best Italian food I have eaten since I left Italy in March. The food was piping hot and hard to resist as you wait for it to be cool enough to eat because you know it's delicious but you don't want to burn your tongue and miss out on how good it is. I called ahead to ask if they allowed dogs on the patio and they made sure to have a table set up with a table cloth, plates, and utensils before we arrived. The server was witty and just the right amount of a smart ass to be hilarious. The only negative thing I have to say is that they mentioned bread three times before it actually came and I was kinna hungry so I was looking forward to it each time it was mentioned. We did finally receive the bread on the third mention and it was also blissfully scrumptious."}
{"text":"We decided to spontaneously try this restaurant on a Thursday evening. Easy access and plenty of parking. Ambiance is old school Italian, frescoes on the walls, white table clothes and comfortable seating. Our waiter (who was excellent and attentive) informed us of specials and also that most pastas were made in house, veggies organic, chicken free range, fresh not frozen or farm raised fish. This wasn't noted in the menu or website but was certainly a nice surprise.   We started with Caesar salad which was very good, crisp lettuce, homemade croutons and high quality Parmesan cheese. Chicken Marsala was not on the menu but the chef had no problem making it. The dish came with veggies and our additional request of pasta. The other dish we ordered was eggplant Parmesan with penne. Both dishes were superb!    The Marsala had a good complement of mushrooms and the reduction was full flavored. The eggplant was perfectly cooked, generously covered with real mozzarella. Portions were more than ample and pricing very fair.   Dessert was cheesecake that tasted like it just came off the plane from New York, garnished with fresh berries and real whipped cream. This place is a great find. Mangia!  For the type of restaurant this is, it is deserving of a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"We decided to go here based on some reviews from friends.  The menu is 95% filled with items with veal or pork. So had less of a choice of dishes.  .  There raviolis are very small and they charge $3.00 for one.  They are just okay.  The sauce the ravioli come with is a little bit salty along with most of their pasta sauces a little too much salt for my liking.  The clam appetizer with the cucumbers and carrots were pretty good..  Everyone at the table enjoyed the olive oil and garlic mixture which came with the bread.  ... Just basic bread no real taste unless you use the garlic sauce which was yummy.  The breaded raviolis for app was just okay nothing was wow.  The Chilean Sea Bass $36.00 was a nice large piece cooked perfectly.  We expected great tasting food and were very disappointed until we got to dessert the Lemon gelato was the high light of the night.....But then we got home and we all were sick to our stomachs and spent most of the night in the bathroom...Not real sure what we ate but we got sick so not a good thing and the bill was kind of high for the amount of food we did not get....Since we do not eat veal or pork not lots of choices....The service was exceptional. but just stay away from the food which made us sick, thinking it was the sauce from the raviolis.  Might try for lunch, maybe they were having an off day or something.   We would return just for the lemon dessert"}
{"text":"Hubs and I like to support family owned businesses. So, when we were craving Italian, we had to try this place out instead of the mega-restaurant maggianos across the street (nothing against maggianos).  Have to say this. CHAZ. Out server was unique and made the whole dining out experience a 5 star.  The food was probably more of a 3.5 or a 4. But Chaz made it top notch. He was engaging. Entertaining and made sure we felt at home.  He even made sure our leftovers got additional sauce and met our specs.   Will be back! Check in with Yelp for a discount."}
{"text":"I am originally from New Jersey and it has taken quite a bit of time for me to find a really outstanding Italian restaurant in the valley.  I have finally found it at La Torretta.  I came here with my family this weekend and I was very impressed with the intimacy of the space.  Our tables were already set for fine dining (which is a very classy touch), and the staff was so accommodating I actually wasn't completely sure who our main server was until the end as they were all so helpful and accommodating.  (extra points to them for working as a team!)  I started with the meatballs arribiatta which I was warned were on the spicy side.  I said that was alright and decided to be adventurous.  They were absolutely delicious with a lot of heat.  For my main course I got the filet mignon which was served with mushrooms and potatoes.  It was cooked perfectly and was the best filet I've had in years.  I can't wait for my next special occasion so I can try something else.  I kept eying the plates that went by and everything looked amazing.  Truly a great find."}
{"text":"I notice that some people give this establishment a low rating because of prices.  What they don't know, is that most Italian places (even high-end) have food that is cooked and ready before you even arrive, and even re-heated.  La Torretta is a special place that serves fresh food, and you get what you pay for here.  If you think it is \"too pricey\" for home-made Italian, then I'd suggest you never visit California, or cities like Chicago, NY etc. because La Torretta's prices are extremely reasonable in comparison.  And if you are wise enough to check Groupon.com, you'll find a generous deal of 50% off your bill.   The service for my wife and I was top-notch, and the atmosphere was fantastic.  We went when it was a bit slower, which is what I prefer for a romantic evening.  I've already purchased the Groupon deal for my brother-in-law, so I obviously have no problem recommending La Torretta to anyone.  A must try for any Italian lover!!"}
{"text":"Yum, Yum, Yum!  Excellent authentic Italian food!  My hubby and I went out for a fantastic evening and decided to try this restaurant due to the reviews here and our restaurant.com gc!  Impressive!  The service was excellent and the food was to DIE FOR!  My husband had the chicken and sausage Cacciatore and he loved the freshness of the sauce...not overly processed but tasty.    I had the Four Cheese Chicken.  All I can say is:  arrive hungry!  The chicken itself would have been a little over the top but the combination of all the cheese and the amazing taste of the flavorful chicken just worked.  The mushroom demi-glaze was perfect with it.  Oh, and we had the fried Ravioli to start and it's much better than your run of the mill stuff others serve!  Again the Marinara makes it.  We paid about $60 including tip with our GC and we will return again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Amazing pesto and all the food is made from scratch from the pasta to the vegetables. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Excellent service from Chas, he really took good care of us and we came in with five children and four adults so we were a handful!  They were accommodating doing half orders and the food was amazing. It felt like a small town home owned business. Careful when you're reading reviews from people because I noticed a lot of inaccurate comments about this place we've been there twice and actually really enjoy it. Make the decision for yourself. The food will speak for itself!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for his birthday and had a great experience! The food was really good and we really enjoyed our waiter's sense of humor! I had the crab ravioli - it was to die for! My husband had the Veal Marsala and loved it as well! I would definitely recommend the Creme Brûlée for dessert - it was amazing! We would return!"}
{"text":"Being from the East Coast, it is very difficult to find good authentic Italian food in Arizona. My family moved here in 2001 and have been to every restaurant you could imagine. Five years ago we had  the fortunate opportunity to have dinner at La Torretta Italian Restaurant and Steak House, which was highly recommended by a friend, and I have to say the food was excellent and the service was outstanding. Since then, we have had several birthday parties as well as Christmas office parties and often will go there for lunch. This restaurant is as good if not better than any Italian restaurant in New York or Jersey."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Homemade pasta that tastes as smooth as butter when it touches your tongue. Wine selection that makes your mouth water before you even take your first sip.  A definite try if you love genuine Italian cuisine and crave the magnificent taste of homemade pasta."}
{"text":"Old school Italian in all the best ways!  The bread and seasoned EVOO was amazing and an appetizer in itself.  I ordered the Eggplant Parm--not over breaded and fried yet tender and so flavorful!  As a vegetarian, this is my go to dinner and I have to say that it is the best I've had in the Valley!  Lastly, our waiter, Maria, talked us into the lemon sorbet for dessert.  It was a perfect ending to the night!    Also, the atmosphere was relaxed and the music was low enough that we could carry on a conversation without having to use our outside voices.  The wait staff is super professional and the owner cares about how you are enjoying your evening.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants where everything is homemade!! I thought that this place was absolutely delightful!!! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to have a delicious Italian meal!!! Our waiter was very nice and I really enjoyed the food. Check this place out if you're ever in North Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I had the bruschetta and caprese appetizer with the cannelloni fiorentino and gnocchi entre.   Great service. The manager/owner and different servers always made sure my drink was refilled. There was a large party dining in, but I was always cared for despite the crowd. I was placed in a booth near the window, perfect for me because I wanted a view of the mountains.   The appetizer was great. I'm not a fan of olives but the olives were cooked in some wine that made it edible. The salad was drenched in a delicious dressing. The bruschetta and mozzarella were okay.  I would try a salad over the bruschetta and caprese    The entre was huge. I don't have a big appetite in general but the dish I ordered looked like 2 pasta entre's. I would like for there to be more vegetables because the dish was very heavy.   I'd give the food 3 stars but the service 5 stars. I was comfortable dining there despite being a party of 1."}
{"text":"This is hands-down a 5-star establishment.  It is family owned and they take such good care of you.  Plus...the food is so incredibly delicious.  I travel everywhere and have been to more restaurants than I can count, but this is by far one of my top favorites!"}
{"text":"Not sure what to expect based on earlier very mixed reviews, but WOW! Great service, amazing entrees. My husband was thrilled by his eggplant parmesan (his standard for Italian). I had escolar with a lemon caper sauce, lobster ravioli, steamed veggies, all done to perfection. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Great food. great service. The owner obviously knows haw to please his patrons in every way.  Large portions of fabulous Italian classics. Go. You will be happy!"}
{"text":"i ordered salmon with penne with vodka sauce,terrible,it was NOT SAlmon,it was a hard over done White fish,dried out,terrible. Our first and last time .The owner said it was salmon,but i eat salmon all the time,and it was Not,it was a white fish,terrible that he didnt care.He was rude.not what an owner should do."}
{"text":"Fantastic pasta, the bread so different and delicious! Love the oil with fresh sun dried tomatoes. My husband and I make it a point to come back here every time we are in the area. Owner Darius was a wonderful host. Did I mention martinis? They were made to perfection. See you next year!"}
{"text":"Scratch this one off the list.  It was horrible.  We were enticed with a Travel Zoo coupon.  But it was not even worth 1/2 price.  It is a neighborhood Italian restaurant with no personality or charm.  Prices were definitely high for the ambiance and quality.  My fish was so \"fishy\" I couldn't eat it.  My wife had the eggplant and it was oily.   The bread was burned and dry.  Desserts at $9 was terrible.  They supposedly make their own Teramisu, so we tried it.  It was mostly fake whipped cream and the inside tasteless and soggy.  There are much better Italian restaurants in the area and more moderately priced.  The service was not up to par.  We got the wrong dish.  The waitress seemed like she really didn't care that we were there.  I doubt this place will make it much longer.  It was no more than a third full on a Saturday night.  Trust me on this and STAY AWAY.  It was one of the worst meals I've had in a long long time.  I'd rather go to a cafeteria."}
{"text":"WOW, I mean wow. This place has great customer service, excellent food and at a good price. Very romantic as well and somewhere I would recommend taking a date with your significant other or even for a first date with someone new."}
{"text":"4 stars only because the atmosphere isn't fantastic but the menu, service and food are all WONDERFUL! I have always wanted to try this place because it's literally right down the street from my house. Our server was an older gentleman who was very polite, very knowledgeable on the menu and personable! We got the meatballs to start and my ole faithful, chicken parm and both items were FANTASTIC! and very generous portions! I will definitely be back when I'm craving Italian! My mouth is watering as I type this!!!"}
{"text":"I think this place could do well if they made some changes. First of all... the iced tea was not good. I think I recall a previous reviewer comparing the taste to Band-Aids. I've never tasted one, but the tea tasted as they smell... oddly plastic-y. My roommate ordered the chicken parm, and although he didn't say it was bad... he seemed remorseful from not ordering the Lobster Ravioli. In my opinion, it looked like it had way too much mozzerella, couldn't even see any breaded parts of the chicken. I ordered the cannelloni, a favorite of mine. I was dismayed when I saw it covered in meat sauce (which tasted canned). Now, in my many experiences in ordering this dish, it's always been paired with a cream sauce! The menu didn't specify. The good thing I suppose, was the gnocci served with it (which was good) had cream sauce and I would steal some of that and incorporate it into bites of my cannelloni. Creme brulee was not horrible, but the carmelized sugar could have been darker and more berries would've been nice for the price. So overall... it was ok, not great, but ok. The server was Chazz and was very personable and friendly."}
{"text":"I have eaten at La Torretta multiple times for dinner.  It is always fantastic!  No dish has ever disappointed and the wine is always perfect with the dish.  Immaculately clean and well kept, some may not like the decor as it is \"old fashioned Italian.\"  When I walk in, I feel like I've walked into a decades-old, family-owned Italian restaurant that would be found in the burrows of New York.  I love that!!  If you love authentic Italian food, this decor is perfect!    For those of you who don't know, Sofia Loren's photos abound because the owner's Mom and Sophia were life-long friends.  For decades, whenever Sophia was in the area, she'd stop in to have dinner at La Torretta.  It does not get more authentic Italian than that!  If Chaz happens to be serving you, ask him to sing you a song.  You'll be blown away!"}
{"text":"Best Italian ever. Always amazing service. Gluten free options. I always order the smoked Chicken over pasta with a white sauce and creme brûlée. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Let's begin with the atmosphere and Decour, this is a non-pretentious place and is focused on  customer first, good service, quality food, and reasonable prices. The evening started with an order of calamari and a wonderful Chianti to kick things off. The The second course comprised of wonderful cheese ravioli talked with small Walmart chips you gave it a wonderful woodsy flavor.  The only decision left is to do dessert would you have a rack of lamb call it a night! Only kidding, how about a crème brûlée for dessert.   If you're looking for a restaurant that serves  quality food with great flavors and old fashion gravy(that sauce for you Southerners) then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"First time there and was very satisfied. Was not that hungry but was in the mood for Italian. The service was excellent and later found out that the other waiter was the owner. Very nice and personable. We can tell a good Italian restaurant by the Sauce and the Calamari. I give them both 5 out of 5. The Caesar salad was different but delicious and the hot bread was served with a delicious oil. We decided to split a 4 cheese chicken dish. The waiter was nice enough to split this and add a little spaghetti. Truthfully, after the large Calamari, Caesar salad and bread we had to still take home half the dinner."}
{"text":"Fabulous service and authentic Italian cuisine!  Try the sautéed calamari and cannoli for dessert.  Everything on the menu is amazing- I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great family owned restaurant. great wine selection particularly the new Pinot from jwrigley vineyards. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were greeted upon entry by two very nice people.  The food was the best and deliciously prepared.  The attention was spectacular.  Our waiter was superb."}
{"text":"I came to La Torrenta with a friend using a Groupon.  We each were able to choose an entree and get a bottle of wine.  We got the crab and lobster ravioli.  The crab ravioli was good, but the lobster ravioli my friend got was even better.  It is the best tasting crab ravioli I ever had.  The only thing that takes this from a 5 star experience is the service was a little slow.  Our waiter didn't write down our order, and we asked about our side salads.  He said its being made, and he came back with it in couple minutes.  It seemed like our waiter was a little bit forgetful.  Nevertheless, he was a good server that entertained us with his sarcasm."}
{"text":"Best family owned italian place in scottsdale. Crab rav. Is amazing o so. Buco.having to use abbreviations sorry but amazing . Worth the trip tucked in a lil corner near promenade shopping center on other side. They use to have an amazing lobster rav. Not shure what happened hope that pops back on menu. Def worth a visit."}
