{"text":"Food was okay, but service is bad and the presentation of food is lacking. I been to plenty of Ethiopian resturants and it something i miss dearly from home in Seattle. So when i went the first time, things were enjoyable.But the last three times ive tried bringing others here its been disappointing to say the least. The service has went down hill completely not sure if under different management. What you order is not normally what you expect, its extremely bizarre. I normally dont write reviews but felt like i needed to, so people would not be fooled, im currently not sure of where else to go but we will definitely not be back. Please Beware"}
{"text":"My first time trying Ethiopian food and I loved it. It was very flavourful and great customer service."}
{"text":"Okay... I may not be from Ethiopia, but I've had my share of Ethiopian food.  I've even been to Ethiopia and had the food there (a friend is from Ethiopia).  But, this is a place for opinions, and here's mine.  Food:  For about $10 a dish, I've had much better tasting Ethiopian food - in Chicago, Minneapolis, and Los Angeles (and Addis Ababa).  I've been to Abyssinia restaurant about three times, and each time was a subpar performance.  I kept hoping each day was a fluke, but the food had always been below average.  The veggie combo is questionable.  Some parts are okay, like the lentils (misir wat), while other parts smell and taste spoiled like the collard greens (goman).  I've also had the shiro which was sometimes gooey and other times pastey.  The zil zil tibs (strips of beef) are too tough and chewy, and I was too afraid to try the kitfo (raw/rare beef).  As far as I'm aware, zil zil tibs is one of the more popular Ethiopian dishes, and if they can't even get that right, then something is wrong with the cook.  The one decent dish I did have was the quanta firfir.  But I guess it's difficult to screw up beef jerky.  Service:  The staff (Ethiopians) are generally friendly, but I think they are skeptical of non-Ethiopians walking into the restaurant.  Everytime I went in to order food, they would give me a look, as if to say, \"Are you lost?\"  But would lighten up and smile, when I start ordering food.  The food arrvies quickly - about 15 minutes for two dishes.  Atmosphere:  A very small restaurant, there are about 10 tables designed for 2-4 people, Ethiopian music playing softly in the backgroud, generally all Ethiopians for clientele, the decor isn't very impressive, but again it's a small restaurant.  Location:  If you blink, you'll miss it.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall near a Target store.  The only distinguishing feature is the Ethiopian colors (green, yellow, red) running across the front windows.  You don't even notice the restaurant's name until you're right next to it, and you're looking for it.  Advice:  I have yet to find a decent Ethiopian restaurant in Las Vegas.  I hope to find one soon, so I can sugget a different place to go to for Ethiopian food.  Note:  \"Google maps\" lists this place as \"Abyssimia\" with the letter 'm', instead of \"Abyssinia\"."}
{"text":"What an excellent find for this tourist couple!  My wife and I both love Ethiopian food and this place was really good.  I had the vegi-platter.  She ordered beef tibs and a side of red lentils.  All the food was very good and flavorful.  The injera had a really nice tangy taste to it. Wife's only critique was that the pieces of meat could have been cut up much smaller.    We are always glad to find a nice restaurant off the strip and away from the casinos."}
{"text":"Good food horrible service!! Love the food but I don't want to ruin my day by dealing with their servers!"}
{"text":"Food is good here. So are the prices, as well as the service.  Got the veggie combo. Very tasty. I could, however, do without the collards, but understand it's part of the combo. Plenty of injera, which was also very good. We were stuffed for $20.  This is a good place to try if you've never had Ethiopian food. It's conveniently located about a mile or two west of the Strip off Tropicana next to a Panda Express (which of course had more customers, go figure)."}
{"text":"As you enter the restaurant it has a very traditional appearance in the front and basic tables with chairs throught out the rest.  The service was good but a bit of a language barrier for me but luckily I was with friends from Ethiopia and Eritrea.The food was pretty good with a lot of variety. This place is also vegeterian friendly as well."}
{"text":"Nice flavours but the meat was absolutely shockingly bad. Never been served this bad meat in a restaurant. It would be better if the staff spoke English, but that was a minor"}
{"text":"We were *very* pleasantly surprised by this Ethiopian restaurant and would recommend it.  It wouldn't quite earn a four-star rating if this were a city like, say, Washington, DC--where there's a huge Ethiopian community and hence lots of competing restaurants--but this was very, very good place for this area.  And, crucially, it is authentic.  In fact, there is bilingual Amharic-English signage to prove that and cool African TV shows running in the background!  Food wise, the Injera was spot on, made properly with teff flour (healthy for you, btw!)--delicate, delicious.  We got one of the veg + non-veg assortment plates and liked most of the many things on it.  The service can be a little slow.  (Be patient.)  But the servers themselves are incredibly sweet people.  Don't expect much in the way of alcoholic beverages.  Just come for the food.    I should say that we liked the place so much that we went back, even though we were only in the Vegas area for 5 days.  A much healthier option that hitting the buffets on the strip!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try Ethiopian food and this place did not disappoint.  Their entrees were delicious and very tasty.  I can't remember the names of the dishes but my party got the combo so that we could taste everything.  We weren't a fan of the raw meat though because it had a weird sour taste.  I am also not a fan of the bread.  It is just too sour for my taste and the texture is not something I'm used too but everyone else in my party loved it.  To each their own!  The only reason I'm giving this place a 3-star is because of lack of service.  We waited 40 minutes for our check because our server was busy entertaining a customer at the bar and waited another 15 minutes to wait for our change.  Overall, the foods were delicious."}
{"text":"Pretty good authentic Ethopian food and always served fresh. Remember since the food is made fresh there usually is a bit of a wait. We've never been there during the crazy hours so it hasn't been too bad. My only issue with this place is you have to pay for water."}
{"text":"Good Ethiopian food, and obviously a popular place (the place was almost full on a Friday night). I only regret they didn't have tej."}
{"text":"Being in the hospitality industry, I am VERY forgiving when it comes to service. This was easily hands-down the worst I've ever had. Terrible attitudes from the staff (started off with, \"What do you want?\"), then completely ignored the entire time (except when of course we just got up \"as if to leave without paying\" they finally took a break from the only two other tables in the place to to rush over), no water, no offer of anything else to eat or drink... only to attempt to take a very undeserved 40% gratuity off the table at the end. This would be a 5 if it weren't for the horrific service. The food was exactly as it should be. Being the only white people in the room and seeing the interaction with the other patrons, with an instant shift when we walked in, it was clear we weren't welcome. A friendly Asian couple also had walked in half way through our time there, only to be ignored for at least 20 minutes before even being offered menus, whereas an Ethiopian table walking in just before was rushed to and  serviced quickly. Never going back."}
{"text":"Got the vegetarian platter and the gluten free bread for 2 dollars extra. It was my first time trying Ethiopian and it was super yummy. The 100% teff flour bread was a little sour compared to the regular bread (so my friend said) but it was still good! So I'd definitely recommend it. It was very clean, gluten free and vegan friendly, and the host was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Amazing and delicious food! One of my favourites on the danforth.   The lamb is Ontario raised and tastes divine!"}
{"text":"First time here during my visit, enjoyed every single of everything.  Delicious food, but most of all, the service was extra ordinary.  Served by amazing server named Emebet.  Very professional, attentive and courteous.  KUDOS Emebet, you were one of a kind.  We'll definitely come back again.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Had something different every visit, always amazing! One of the times was my first time ever experiencing Ethiopian food and I was not disappointed. Everything is very fresh, very flavorful. Slightly off the strip so its enough out of the way but not hard to find. Must try!"}
{"text":"Came to vegas for the Viva Las Vegas Rockabilly weekender at the Orleans.  This place is located conveniently across the street from the orleans.  Since my boyfriend and I are vegan we decided to give this place a try.  There were mostly Ethiopian people eating here which indicated to me that the food must be good  / authentic.   We shared the veggie combo and some sambusas and everything was great!  Ambiance is nothing special but not a big deal to me."}
{"text":"Very tasty & a bargain for what you get!  My friend and I ordered the vegetarian sampler plate - which came with six different items plus a bit of salad - all served on a single large plate that was covered with injera - the spongy crepe-like bread that you use in lieu of utensils.  Language can present a bit of a challenge here. Although our servers spoke enough English to order and to get the basic ideas across, details were vague. We asked to server to tell us what each dish was before we dug in, and the answers were \"This one is sweet ... This is cabbage. This is Spicy and red\" etc   No names, or even even what was in them (except for cabbage).  No matter; we figured out that basically there were several lentil/legume dishes with various spice treatments, a cabbage stew, and collard greens. Each was delicious.   Usually when eating Ethiopian food, I enjoy a glass of Tej, the sweet honey wine that is akin to European mead. Unfortunately, here they only serve it by the bottle, so I went without.   Also, the music (which was pretty awesome) was unfortunately very VERY loud - to the point where it was difficult to hold a conversation. One of my party couldn't take it, and wound up leaving early.   As others have mentioned, this block gets kinda sketchy at night. Lock your car, and keep your eyes open. Don't be afraid, just aware."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place since I read the Yelp reviews a few weeks ago.  Last night, the group was feeling a little adventurous, so we headed over to Abyssinia.  The restaurant is very nice and clean, and was quiet enough to have easy group conversation, which I believe is key to having a shared table meal.  The only negative points this place got was the language barrier for us non-native language speaking folks.  Being there are approximately 90 languages spoken in Ethiopia, I wouldn't even know where to start to remedy that.  The menu items were in English, but descriptions were in local language, so it was a \"best guess\", which if fun anyway.  The waitress had a difficult time getting our message sometimes, but she was very sweet.  We ordered a meat and vegetable sampler, a jerky dish, a vegetable dish, and one of the group wasn't feeling so adventurous and ordered spaghetti.  I guess that's the default American dish for the poor person who was forced to tag along.  :)  The meats and vegetables were amazing!  I wish I knew what everything was.  We were able to determine the chicken, beef, and lamb, but the spices and sauces were a mystery, yet wonderful!  The sour flatbread (injera) was nice and soft and not too sour.  This, being the utensil to pick up all the food, makes for a fun night.  Everyone tearing pieces of bread off and pinching morsels of yummy food from the common plate.  Make sure you're comfortable with your party.  Don't take the guy who doesn't wash his hands in the bathroom!  Oh, and it's culturally acceptable to only use your right hand for eating....I'm pretty sure we all were, but not sure.    In summary, great food & atmosphere.  A recipe for a fun night."}
{"text":"Totally not worth your money.  The food was bland.  I know what good Ethiopian food is and this place does not serve it."}
{"text":"SO DELICIOUS authentic and a great vibe! Love it!! We ordered the meat and veggie combo with the lamb tibs, we shared with 4 people and it was more than enough. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was good (we've eaten at Ethiopian restaurants quite a bit), but the atmosphere was lacking. Service was OK despite being 1 of 2 tables in the restaurant.   We'd recommend the vegetarian platter - the chicken was a bit over cooked."}
{"text":"Yummy and super addictive! We loved how clean this place was. Service was great. The person I came with has a high spice tolerance and he ordered a dish with medium spice level... It was too spicy for him, he wished he got mild spice! The server said my dish would not be spicy, but it definitely was hot and spicy. I recommend adjusting your spice level down one level when ordering if you're a first time customer here. We had a fantastic experience and will be back. I loved this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were completely speechless toward the food's deliciousness and top-notch service. We found this awesome place while searching for restaurants during our fasting commitment. The environment was very comfortable and humbling."}
{"text":"Great food. This little whole in the wall is great for authentic cuisine and casual atmosphere.  No rushing and enjoyable music"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Everyone is kind, friendly, and happy food is different and super yummy. Love the way they spice their food.  Fantastic prices for a lot of great vegan food. We will be coming back. We got the vegan combination platter. We loved in particular the shiro and the cheepis. I also enjoyed the collard greens.  The samosa was also very good.  The waitress was light and friendly and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Abyssinia was another surprise find in the area.   D discovered this place when heading to Walgreens and made a mention to me.    It's been well over a year since I've had Ethiopian food so it was exciting to hear about this option less than ten minutes from our hotel.    We stopped by to get a menu to review.  I checked out the menu and immediately zeroed in on their meat and veggie combo as well as a sambusa appetizer.     We returned to the restaurant Thursday evening around 8pm to dine.  I will say it does seem to be an authentic restaurant since the majority of the patrons appeared to be of Ethiopian descent.    We stood around for about a minute before a random patron sitting at a table (perhaps a family member) called out to a server to seat us.  She wound up being pleasant though providing average service.   There was a separate server that gave us water.    The water was warm which was disappointing.  We ordered tea and was disappointed to see a Lipton bag.   D thought he tasted a hint of spice (similar to the tasty tea we had at Ethiopian Diamond in Chicago) but I didn't taste anything.      The sambusa appetizer was served dry, cold and pricey.    We received two in total at $2.50 a pop.   We also didn't get any extra plates to put our own individual sambusa on though since it was dry, there was no leakage to worry about.   Some kind of dipping sauce would've made the dish slightly better.   Meh so far.  The main event came in the form of a meat and veggie combo platter that we ordered.   There looked to be three different varieties of lentils, spinach, cabbage/carrot dish, two varieties of beef, two varieties of lamb, cottage cheese, and a main chicken dish with an egg.   We were given a basket of injerra bread that was served cold.   The lentils were all cold.    One of the beef dishes was raw (which I believe is their speciality).   I did try beef tartare at a French bistro a long time back and wasn't a fan.   I wasn't a fan of Abyssinia's rendition either.   I also didn't care for the cottage cheese.    The meat dishes were lukewarm overall though they had a nice spice.   D found the spicing strong but his tolerance for spicy food isn't the greatest.  I found it average.  Eh (a step below meh...LOL).  With our hands being dirty from the food, it was disappointing to not get even a basic wipe packet.   I wound up washing my hands at the Orleans.     I definitely need to make my way back to Ethiopian Diamond soon."}
{"text":"Was on a business trip to Toronto and came across this gem. The owner is super nice and the food is delicious. Being the first and likely only time I would eat here due to not even living in Canada, we went with a \"safe bet\" for our dinner party since I was the only one that had ever eaten Ethiopian food. For our group of three, we got a beef and lamb platter for two and a vegetable platter for two. All of us loved our food! So I'd say that the food is not only good for first-timers, but for those (myself) who had eaten plenty of Ethiopian food before as well.   Both of the platters essentially served two versions of every item in the platter. There was a mild and a hot version. I personally didn't find the hot version too hot and neither did my other two guests, one of whom can only tolerate moderate amounts of heat. However, if you like a lot of heat like Indian or Thai hot, then you'll need to request it. Each of the items had distinct flavors, which were all really good. I've noticed that at some places, multiple items on the platter end up tasting the same, but that was not the case here.   The coffee is a pretty neat treat as well, to end off the meal. It is actually a coffee ceremony, which includes freshly roasted coffee (literally roasted upon ordering in a small pan) served in a special pot accompanied by burning incense and popcorn. Please don't make the same mistake as I did and pour your own coffee when it is ready! Being a coffee person myself, I timed the brew time and wrongly assumed that when the owner walked off, we just serve ourselves. So after some time passed, I started pouring and as soon as I did, the owner walks up and sees me doing it and made a sad face and said that she was supposed to do it as part of the ceremony! I felt bad but at least we had the same internal coffee timer haha. Anyways, the coffee is pretty strong but very flavorful and the taste is actually enhanced by incense. This was a neat experience and I've never thought to order coffee at an Ethiopian restaurant before, but will definitely remember to do so from here on out."}
{"text":"Excellent food and good service. It's a treat every time. Healthy, real food. A must try"}
{"text":"Abyssinia is the third Ethiopian restaurant we've eaten at in Las Vegas and I would say it is the best.  The decor is pleasant, the servers speak English well, the menu is easy to understand and the food is plentiful and delicious!  The Ethiopian beer is good and complements the food.  The portions are quite generous.  I regret not getting our leftovers to take home, but we had a long flight the next day.  I have the vegetarian platter and my husband had a chicken dish.  We were both very happy."}
{"text":"First time trying Ethiopian food and it was different. We weren't sure about the menu and the waitress didn't speak much English either so we couldn't ask questions and she couldn't explain the menu to us. So we took a shot and got one of those platters that comes with a variety of things so we could try a little bit of everything. All the \"toppings\" were really good...but we didn't enjoy the meal because of the \"bread\" or \"dough\" that comes with the platter. The dough had a spongy texture and tasted like sourdough, which I am not a fan of. I would have enjoyed this more if I could have ordered rice to eat with all the toppings :)   The 3 star is not for bad service or bad food, I just didn't have a great experience because I was not sure what to order and because I didn't like the dough. I don't see myself coming back unless I have someone who could explain the menu to me and give me advice on what to order."}
{"text":"Having traveled to Ethiopia and Washington DC (where they have some of the best Ethiopian food in the US), I found Abyssinia to be good but not outstanding. Perhaps they were having a bad night. But it was a Friday night if remember correctly, soooo....  The best part to me was the \"coffee ceremony\". Its one of those things that you have to know about and ask for to get. Coffee ceremony is where the coffee beans are roasted over coals and fresh roasted in an authentic black coffee kettle. Its a long process....perhaps 30 min (thus the reference to \"ceremony\") But its well worth the wait and done at your table, so quite entertaining. The coffee is so smooth and so strong it will make Starbucks seem like Folgers.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much the only spot I come to for Ethiopian food. Their hours are extensive, the food is amazing and the prices are more than fair.  My standard order is usually a veggie combo with either spicy beef tibs, doro wot or kitfo...and I am never let down.  I have been coming here since long before I joined Yelp, since way back when they were next to the Target on Flamingo and Maryland, and I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend one random weekday evening because she had a craving for Ethiopian cuisine. The place was quiet, but the food was quite tasty! We shared the vegetarian platter, which gave a nice sampling of different dishes. Most were very mild, so it's a good place if you have a low heat tolerance. The waitress was quite nice as well. The tablecloth was not the cleanest, but aside from that, it was a pretty cute spot for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for awhile and it it was ....okay. First impression of the restaurant itself was not too impressive. It's in a dicey strip mall near the Orleans. The inside isn't very welcoming or decorated in any special way. It's a mix of sparsely placed ethiopian decor mixed with cheap tables and chairs circa cheesy 90's.  Service left much to be desired. I sat for quite awhile before even getting water. Then had to wave down the waitress to take my order. She was also less than helpful when I told her it was my first time there. Food took a loooong time to come. There were only 2 other tables in the whole place, so the bad service and long time for food to come didn't go over well for me. I was hangry.  Okay now the good part...THE FOOD!! I ordered the veggie combo plate and it was sooo delicious! There were 3 or 4 different stews and then some veggies and a salad. The injera bread was in the top 2 that I've ever had. I also had the beer (can't recall the name, but it was very refreshing!). The food alone was very good, if I were just rating that it would be a 4 star rating. However, the service and lack of warm and fuzzy feeling inside take it down to a 3. Bill came out to $60 for a veggie plate and a lamb plate, and 2 beers. Not a great deal, yet not awful.  I don't think I'd return to this restaurant, instead I'll try one of the other ethiopian restaurants in town next time."}
{"text":"Solid Ethiopian in Stamford. Was a bit skeptical at first - but dishes are very flavorful - especially the beef. Also like the wine selection, and they have Tusker beer to make it feel at least somewhat more genuine!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't accept Groupon. When I asked why, I was told they didn't have a Groupon. I showed them the voucher they just smiled and said they wouldn't accept it"}
{"text":"I'll definitely be back. Ethiopian food is an excellent cuisine and should be the next trendy ethnic food in the USA. The quality of the food was excellent. My favorite combo was the $30 combo and will feed two ultra hungry guys. Choosing combos is my thing because it leaves all of the guesswork out of the entree names. There are plenty of tables and the decor is cute."}
{"text":"Went there today, 5/14/2017, on Mother's Day, at 11 am. They were just opening. We were sitting next to the coffee ceremony area and they started burning incense and we had to go out on the patio, because our group had an infant and a toddler, and a person who gets headaches from the smoke. The food was great! We ordered the meat and veggie combo ($30 I think) and, although it looked like it wouldn't be enough for 4, we could barely finish it. Everything was delicious and the service was good. There's a small mom-and-pop Ethiopian market in the same building too, so we went there after and got some injera bread and spices to cook with at home."}
{"text":"After movie night we looked for a dinner place, so I checked my bookmarks of new places we have been wanting to try and saw that Abyssinia was only .2 miles away! Sorted  We walked in and there were only a couple of tables filled. We sat and perused the menu. The last time we had Ethiopian food was a few years ago in Amsterdam. We decided on the veggie and meat platter. A unique dining experience where you eat with a soft spongy flat bread instead of silverware. The food was served on a huge platter which included veggies with something sour, sweet, savory and bland. The contrast of flavors was enticing. The meats included chicken with a delicious sauce, beef and lamb. Again some of sauces were spicy, savory and marinated with interesting spices. You rip a piece of the spongy bread and grab from the piles of food on the platter.  Thank you Abyssinia for a nice cultural experience."}
{"text":"Best Ethiopian in my neighbourhood!... traditional food and excellent, friendly service that is unbeatable at these reasonable prices..."}
{"text":"So far it's the best and most authentic Ethiopian restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas. I had the shero and it was just like the shero I've had in Ethiopia. Service was terrific and the coffee was good. The only complaint is that the enjara was not completely made with Teft but was blended with wheat flour."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. We bought a groupon that they advertised all over their website and on the groupon app itself. They refused to take it and the lady was rolling her eyes and yelling and handling it so unprofessionally. The thing is, we would have gladly paid the full amount and tip generously as we always do when we have kind service. But the way she straight up said \"no\" when we showed her the groupon and started yelling and gossiping to other customers in the restaurant (all of this happening in under 10 minutes) was just rude. We ended up just paying the full amount and leaving with no further argument. I would highly suggest trying another place."}
{"text":"Delicious food. The music was quite loud. The room was dimly lit. The service was slow. But I am happy to deal with those things for the quality of the food. Plus this place is open until 3am. Really good. I will return."}
{"text":"Was my first time trying Ethiopian food, and I'm glad I did. I wasn't sure what to expect or what to order, but I think I made the right choices. I had a Sambusa and Doro Tibs. The Sambusa was Very good! The outside was nice and flaky, but the inside was very flavorful. I should have ordered more than one. The Doro Tibs is a chicken dish, with onions and sliced jalapeno peppers. You can tell them the level of spicy you want. You get a choice of rice or Injera, and I chose injera to be more authentic. The chicken had a good flavor and I imagine it would go well with rice as well. I would use the injera bread sparingly, since it will make you full quickly. The service was casual, and a little on the slower side, but that didn't ruin my experience at all. I'd recommend this restaurant to someone wanting to try Ethiopian food."}
{"text":"I've passed by Abyssinia many times. Once, humorously thinking that the name was a word play for \"I'll be seeing ya.\" Nope. Abyssinia was actually what Ethiopia was once called in early history.   I've been to only a couple of Ethiopian restaurants in my life, once in Washington D.C. and another time in SF. I went to Abyssinia for lunch with 4 coworkers and we were seated on regular dining tables. For dinner though, they make the entire dining area available. So if you're into a much more interesting experience, opt for no table and sit on the stools surrounding a basket which holds the food that you and your party will be sharing. There will be no plates and don't even think about asking for utensils. Ethiopians eat this stuff with their hands. and everything just tastes better when you do the same. If you're grossed out by having other people's fingers in your food, this might not be your cup of tea.  Our server recommended we share 2 meat combinations and their veggie combination. However, the food came out around 40 minutes after we ordered. Not sure if this was the norm but it was exceedingly slow since we were there on our lunch break from work. The food came on a large platter of stewed dishes on top of Injera bread and more bread on the side. Injera, an Ethiopian food staple, is a spongy flat bread used to sop up the food. The dough is fermented (like sourdough) which gives it a mildly-sour flavor. There was an assortment of meats (chicken, beef and lamb) and stewed veggie dishes. Wish our server took the time to give us a quick rundown of the dishes. I knew we ordered lamb but sadly couldn't tell which meat was which. Maybe it was due to the strong flavor of the stews. Some dishes were spicier than others and good overall but not the best I've ever tried. I will be returning - curious about the experience at dinner time. \"I'll be seeing ya.\" Again."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Ethiopian food, balancing out the service, ambiance, and the food, I'll give it 3 stars.   When we just walked in, we weren't greeted by anybody. There was a very strong aroma of some sort of incense that clouded the room. It was pretty overpowering.  We saw some lady sitting in the corner of the room staring at us. We assumed she was a customer since she didn't say anything, but eventually she got up and we asked her if we could sit anywhere, she said yes. We sat down and she brought us one menu for the both of us, which was a little awkward trying to read from two different sides of the table.   There were a lot of plates on the menu, but since we never had Ethiopian before we didn't know what to get. We opted for the #16, which was the sauteed beef strips for $10.99. We decided to share since we weren't sure about their portions. Good thing we did that, cuz their plate was humungo.    For our drinks we ordered coke ($1.50) and tea ($1.50). I was kind of expecting the tea to be something different, but when she brought it to me she just gave me a glass with hot water and a Lipton tea bag on the side.  My boyfriend just got a can of coke with a straw.   Our food came and it looked like fajitas and salad on top of a giant crepe. She also gave us a basket of more crepe looking things (sorry I never found out the name). He ate a little piece of it on it's own and he didn't like it, it had a salty vinegar taste to it. Surprisingly it actually tasted pretty good when wrapped around a piece of meat and salad.   I enjoyed being able to eat with my hands and not be stared at, but I think it would be nice if they provided some sort of wet towelette to wipe our hands with.   All in all this was a pretty good experience for us. Ethiopian isn't my favorite type of food, but I'm happy I can say that I tried it. I've actually had a few people tell me that this is one of the most authentic Ethiopian places in Vegas.   4 for the food, 3 for the service and ambiance. I can't give half stars so they get a 4:]"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best Ethiopian meals I've had in my life! Order the veggie combo with a meat dish and you will not be disappointed. My only complaint is that I can never go easy on the injera and end up getting too full before the food is gone. Clearly a personal problem. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the mixed veggie and meat platters (two each) for eight people. Each person got their own plate of injera (the spongy, roll-able bread that I love), but of course, each platter order comes with its own base of injera.    Compared to other Ethiopian mixed meat platters that I've had, though, the meat platter seemed to have less meat. Still, the whole meal was really affordable and very satisfying.    Space is pretty small and quiet; I came here with a group of friends, and we were probably the loudest bunch."}
{"text":"This was a really good restaurant which happens to be next to another diamond in the rough. Some hotel food isn't bad but the best food in Vegas is away from the strip.  If you have never had Ethiopian food bring a bunch of friends. It's really good. And the coffee they give you after is amazing."}
{"text":"It's ok. The one thing in all Ethiopian restaurants in Vegas is that i get so grossed out when I go use the bathroom. I don't know why the floor is always.....sticky. I do love the food. But cleanliness...could improve."}
{"text":"Amazing food, the atmosphere was great and flavour and food were very authentic. Having gone to only a handful of ethiopian restaurants, and being ethiopian myself, Abyssinia does an amazing job in bringing out real flavours. The restaurant was recommended to me by a family friend and I would highly recommend it to anyone else as well. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This is hands-down the best Ethiopian restaurant in Vegas, and even better than the places I've tried in Los Angeles.  The veggie platter is amazing...feels like a home cooked meal, but really packed with nutrients and protein!  They have the best service.  The staff is really sweet - we go there so much that they remember our order and have it ready in max 5 minutes each time.    The environment is nicer than most Ethiopian restaurants.  It's clean and well decorated with lots of space for big groups.  We are always able to choose our spot, even when they are packed there always seems to be room somewhere.  It's really relaxed and when it's warmer out, it's nice to sit outside on their small, private patio.  The only complaint that I have is sometimes the herbs that they light for a nice smell get a bit too lit up and can make the room smoky.  It doesn't seem to bother other people, but I am hyper-sensitive and have allergies to something in the herbal mix, so it's a bit overwhelming for me.  But, that rarely happens, and I suffer through because the food is that good.  :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. This was recommended to us by our cab driver. Food is great. We got the veggie/meat combo and all of the dishes were flavorful and different. Prices are reasonable too. We'll def be back here. MUST try!"}
{"text":"This place is SO good. The sabusas taste super good, but were slightly burnt. Service was meh- seems understaffed. Sabusas are just samosas extra fried with lentils inside. Vegetarian buffet was super good yet really cheap- definitely worth it!  Lamb tibs were awesome. Very flavorful. They do not skimp on the bread, which is really nice. (Get medium well).  DO NOT GET THE TIRAMISU. Why one would order tiramisu at an Ethiopian restaurant and expect it to be good I do not know, but it was TERRIBLE.   Juices are bottled in Belgium and from India. If you want an authentic Ethiopian mango juice, if that's a thing, don't get this. If you just want mango juice, go for it.  Still, all ethiopian food was very good. Meat lovers and vegetarians alike will be very happy!"}
{"text":"Make sure you tell the girls your order multiple time they will miss things. The food and live music is great and there open till 3 am. Great place to go to get away from the strip."}
{"text":"I went to have lunch with my son I tried to order the veggie combo which is $11.99. The waitress told me to look at the lunch buffett that contain only veggie dishes that they serve from the day before, and they charge $9.99 per person. However, I told her I wanted the veggie combo instead, but she said NO and she refused to let me order the veggie combo. I was gonna order meet dish as well, but she just didn't want me to order the veggie combo. I took my kid and I got out of there politely. This place lost my business if you are not gonna serve what's on the menu than shut down your place."}
{"text":"Worst experience tonight just came in to get a kitfo sandwich and sambusa and literally waited for 45 minutes for it. The sambusa was burnt and soggy in the middle. Kitfo is good but was so unhappy of the wait when it was not even busy. No sense of urgency and didnt acknowledge my delay. Something needs to change about that because 45 minutes to make a sandwich. Really?"}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend Abyssinia.  I was really pleased with my dinner.  The Yebeg Kay Wot (lamb) was delicious and the YeDoro Kay Wot (chicken) was even nicer with a bit of an extra bite of spiciness.  The service was super friendly and efficient.  And a nice atmosphere.  I'd definitely go back.  The only criticism I would have is that the restaurant has a large flat screen TV and it was playing American football the whole time.  This is a nice Ethiopian restaurant, not a sports bar.  The TV was a real distraction during dinner.  They should keep it off.  Otherwise, a great meal."}
{"text":"My first time venturing into Ethiopian food.  I have a co-worker from Senegal and we have committed to trying all kinds of fare!  We arrived here after googling (so sad) but fun, late one Sunday night.  Passed it twice but finally found it tucked away.  The service was immediate and there were about 3 other tables of patron there at this late hour of the evening (maybe 10ish).  It is very dimly lit so if you dont' know anything about ths food move to a nicely lit table.  The prices were very fair.  Beers and wines available.  The food was fantastic.  The big plate that we shared was fun and different than anything I've experienced before.  I watched others who seemed familiar and my Senegalese friend also knew that you can eat with your hands.  What fun!  We ordered more and we will both definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good food but extremely slow service. Don't expect a quick lunch. Took 30 minutes to get our beer and another 30 just for our appetizer (Sambusa). Another 30 minutes after we finished our food before my husband went up to pay because she didn't bring our check. Even then waitress stood and talked when it was obvious we were ready to go so had to go find her again to run our card. Won't go back just because of excruciatingly slow service."}
{"text":"Abyssinia is so, so great. It's actually my first and only experience with Ethiopian food, so I don't really have a basis for comparison, but it has turned into my must have food. I moved out of town for a couple of minutes last year, and though there was an Ethiopian restaurant an hour away from me, it made more sense to drive the 12 hours home to eat here. (It's my \"only experience\", but I've been here a dozen times, don't get me wrong..)    My friends and I usually get the meat and veggie combo platter, and two or more of us fight over the hard boiled egg. Not that it's particularly better than everything else, but there's only one of them, and no silverware to split it up.. :) (I'm sure they would bring us some if we ever asked, but fighting is better.) The Injera breadstuff that you use to scoop up some filling is my favorite. Also, the honey wine is amazing. Don't ever go here with unadventurous eaters. They're downers, and they will probably make noises and turn their noses. It's a simple presentation, and the spices are harsh, kinda like Indian cuisine. I guess that's the best comparison.. If you like Indian, I think you'll LOOOOVE Ethiopian.   There was a time that even though there seemed to be no one else in there, our waitress would not check on us often, but this has not been a problem the past few times I've been here. Either they have started to like me or they realized it was a problem.. Either way, I love this place. And I hope you don't because I don't want it to get crowded. :b"}
{"text":"One of the best Ethiopian restaurants in Vegas! The inside is beautiful with Ethiopian music playing. The outside patio is very nice. Good to have lunch on a cool day. They also serve traditional Ethiopian coffee.  I ordered the meat and veggie combo. The food was delicious and our waitress was the sweetest!"}
{"text":"It was my first time out to Abyssinia was about a month ago upon a recommendation from a friend. As I'm gettin' seated, my friend whose native of Eritrean commented on how the interior of Ethiopian spots here in LV are better then the ones back home in the Bay Area. We ordered a veggie dish (my friend is pescatarian) which includes plenty of lentils and veggies (duh). I ordered the lamb tibs (bite sized chunks of sauteed meat onion and spices) and what is considered by many Eithopians as their national dish, Doro Wat. Its a chicken leg and hard boiled egg covered in red pepper spices (berberé). We wash our hands spread some injera and get down to eat, all good stuff, pretty standard Ethiopian fare, for what its worth you get plenty of food for around $20.   Recently I was having ridiculous cravings for Ethiopian food again and not to mention I personally like to take 2 to 3 visits before passing judgment on a spot. My vegetarian friend was in town for the NAB and needed me to take her anywhere as long as it was off the strip. Abyssinia hit the spot again. For the uninitiated, Ethiopian food is eaten the same way you eat fries and burgers -- with your hands (to be technical your right hand!). Don't be a cultural square and ask for a fork or spoon por favor.  I've been to two other Ethiopian spots here in Lost Wages: the now closed Axum and Merkato, and this gonna be my go to spot next time I have a craving for Ethiopian food for sure. Its tucked at the end of a tiny strip mall near the New Orleans and Home Depot on Trop. I believe they have events here as I've seen a small stage, sound and lighting equipment lying around. I don't drink much coffee but it would be nice try out their coffee ceremony next time around"}
{"text":"This place is bomb! I had it with my fiance when we were visiting Vegas and absolutely loved it! We both had enough to take home and had some nice hangover breakfast. Yelp providing us with yet another golden nugget :)"}
{"text":"As this is my second review of an ethiopian place, you can clearly see that I dig my injera bread. This place is located just west of the Orleans Casino in a little strip mall. My husband and I decided to check it out. There were several table  filled with what looked and sounded like ethiopian people.  That's always a good sign. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The menu was more extensive than I'm used to seeing on ethiopian menus, so that was nice. We ended up ordering the vegetarian combo and zilzil tibs (steak pan fried with jalepenos and onion). All of the veggie options were fabulous and the waitress automatically brought more injera bread without us having to ask. That's always nice, cuz the way we blaze through it, asking again and again can make one feel like a bit of a hogginy. My only issue was that the meat was a bit on the tough side. The flavor was awesome though, so maybe it was just a fluke. I will try the lamb next time instead. This is one of several ethiopian places in the valley and a favorite of ethiopian locals. We'll definitely head there again."}
{"text":"The best Ethiopian meal I have ever eaten. I ordered the vegetarian combo, which was a bargain at $11.99. I got enough food for three people. Each of the six or seven dishes on injera bread was perfectly cooked and distinctively spiced. My favorites were the green lentils and the delicately sweet carrot and cabbage mixture. The staff were very sweet. I'm so glad my cab driver told me about this place."}
{"text":"Went here to get away from the smokey craziness of the Orleans casino. It looks shady from the outside and I was a little skeptical. Luckily my coworker was game to try it. It was delicious! So reasonably priced too! We were apparently going a little crazy with the ordering and the waitress was very honest with us that that was way too much food. We ended up with her pointing at some things that she thought would be good. I appreciated her honesty. Thought we ordered the Kitfo special, but it was a ground beef dish with a black mound of something and homemade cottage cheese. I don't care what it was called it was amazing! My favorite though were the vegetarian dishes. We got the vegetarian combo. The collared greens and yellow split peas totally rocked. They also keep serving injera as you run out, which is great.  Anyways, this place is awesome and expect leftovers. It's an insane amount of high quality food for a great price. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner this evening, and I ordered the Kitfo Special - #26 on the menu.  As with Teri, the waitress asked if I wanted it well.  I said, \"No,\" very quickly, and she said, \"You want it raw?\"  My answer was a definite yes!!  It was superb.  They gave me a small container of extra spice, and I used a lot of it.  It was quite good!  The meat was almost shredded, and there must have been a pound of beef.  Along with it was collard greens and homemade cottage cheese.  This really is a dish to share because you eat so much injera to consume the dish, and I wasn't coming home after, so I couldn't get a box to go.   I will be back to try the lamb tibs.  This is a great find, and thanks to you who have put your reviews here before!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at an Ethiopian restaurant, it was good, perhaps a little too spicy but that was obviously my fault lol!  I'll definitely keep coming back and trying new things!"}
{"text":"UGH! *WHY* did I come here the night before a nude photo shoot?! I knew I wouldn't be able to control myself around this delicious food....and sure enough, I beasted like a little piggie and now I LOOK like a little piggie :-(  I don't have much to compare this to -- the only other Ethiopian place I've eaten at is Merkato. The food and service were comparable, but this place has the edge when it comes to ambiance: cozy, cheerfully decorated and homey.  A friend and I shared the meat & veggie combo platter for $30 -- something like 10 different scoops of lentils, veggies and meats on a giant piece of injera (spongy sourdough pancake). Plus a basket of injera on the side. Everything was fanTAStic!!!  The only downside was, I ate so much injera and it's all puffed up in my belly now. And as mentioned, I have a nude photo shoot in the morning. Thank dog I do all that ab work at the gym...hopefully my abdominal muscles are strong enough to suck it all back in.   I will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Very clean and quiet place. The food was amazing to say the least. Spice was very tolerable (I am Jamaican though so...). Waitress was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"From the collards to the spicy lamb- was an excellent meal. Early in the evening (1900 on a Sat nite) made for small crowd. Prepackaged beverages, but still planning on being back next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Three young women are in a taxi in Las Vegas. One of them has had a little bit of the drank, and starts talking to the cab driver. He says he's from Ethiopia. The young lady blurts out \"You are?! Oh my gosh my friend LOVES Ethiopian food! Are there any good Ethiopian restaurants here?\"  ~~  So is that offensive? I think it probably is. But good news! The information traveled down to me and when I traveled down to the LV, as the kids call it, I got to go to Abyssinia.   And it was sooooo good. That's four o's, representing how much I ended up losing in Vegas at the card tables after trying this restaurant. I ordered the Misir wot and veggie combo and it was so delicious that it caused my date to start loving Ethiopian food, which previously she thought was only okay.   This is my favorite type of food, and Abyssinia nailed it. Also, the service was kind of bad but I do not care at all. Yum."}
{"text":"I ate here with some friends, including an Eritrean, to celebrate the Eritrean's birthday. It was all of our first time having Ethiopian food. I have read about it before, but it was actually my first time tasting it.  We ordered one wot of chicken, beef, and lamb, along with something else. The wots were individually placed on a huge plate full of injera, which was more than enough for my party of 6. We had enough leftovers for everybody, even after filling our stomachs.  As we were celebrating a birthday, the waitress even brought us some plates, a knife, and some forks for the cake. Now that's customer service.  All of the food was really good. I wouldn't say that I've become a huge fan of East African food, but I did enjoy my time here. I'll come back in the future."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty, but they substituted out something on my veggie combo without saying anything. Not cool if you have food allergies and don't know Ethiopian food enough to tell. The service was also pretty slow, but the flavors made up for it. My boyfriend and I had pretty much the same thing and he was fine, but I ended up with a horrendous stomach ache after that, like because of unknown stuff on the veggie combo plate. Again, would have loved to know what I'm eating if they were gonna change stuff around, not cool :( Kinda scared me off of Ethiopian food for a while."}
{"text":"Some of the Best! Ethiopian food I've ever tasted. Refined vegetarian. Super clean and well balanced seasoning. Thank you, chef. Oh, man it's good. Dined on leftovers that were just as fantastic. Puts a warmth in the belly and a smile to the lips. Vast menu offering. Meat dishes entice. Will be a sure stop each and every time I hit Vegas."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome little place. Yummy food, vegan options, and open 'til very late.  The menu explains that many Ethiopians fast during Lent, Advent and Kweskwam; during which time a vegan diet is maintained. So their vegetarian dishes are all prepared vegan: no milk, fish, butter or ghee. I didn't know about the tradition of fasting, that's pretty cool."}
{"text":"Experience:  my girl wanted to go eat after a movie and she's a vegan, so she picked this spot. She told me it was really good, authentic food. It was about 7pm when we arrived.   Facility:  it's located on the end of a strip mall by some massage spots. The decor is simple yet unique. They have a small \"coffee ceremony\" table as soon as you walk in to the left, and the rest of the room is normal tables and chairs. They played some ethnic music to set the mood too.   Service:  my friend warned me as I was looking up reviews on YELP that the service was not the greatest.  The lady who helped us was nice, but pretty quiet and lackluster. English is not her first language, so my friend struggled with trying to make changes to a dish. They are a little slow with the food too, so just come prepared to sit back and enjoy the company your with, while you wait for authentic food.   Food:  I liked the food. There wasn't anything I tasted that I didn't like; however, there weren't a lot of dishes that made me swoon either. Most of it was just good.  Warning....if you've never eaten Ethiopian food, you eat with your fingers.  They serve a sour porous pancake to scoop the food up with.  I liked them, but only used them a little, as I didn't want to fill up with the \"bread\".  I ordered the massive meat and veggie combo plate, so I could try a little of everything. I don't remember the names of the dishes, but I'll describe the stand outs.  I loved the cabbage, but I'm a big cabbage fan.  The salad was good with a nice vinegar dressing.  The greens were pretty good, considering I'm a southern girl and we always cook them with meat.  I liked this spicy dish with whole boiled eggs in it.  I loved the spiciness and I'm an egg fan, so it worked.  Also liked the raw/marinated meat. It was also spicy, so I enjoyed the kick.  There was so much food, it took 2 large Togo containers to take the rest home.   Overall:  I liked the unique flavors. I liked the authentic flavors and eating with your fingers. I may not be banging down the door tomorrow, but it's a good restaurant I will come back to again someday."}
{"text":"Well, I've had Ethiopian food for about 40 years, have tried hundreds of Ethiopian restaurants in my lifetime, mostly in Ethiopia....... I was born in Addis Abeba, Ethiopia- now residing in California. I'm so glad I came here on vacation to find this gold mine with the help of Yelp.  The quality and taste is as original as it gets to eating in the best Ethiopian food in Addis Abeba, Ethiopia. If not better! This place is a winner!  Our server's name was Mulu, she was very attentive, gave us an excellent service. Really a great experience!"}
{"text":"Abyssinia has changed, and unfortunately, not for the better.  I, along with many friends and relatives, used to frequent the establishment, and until about six months ago, we received quality food and excellent service. However, since the restaurant experienced a change in management, the place has gone downhill. I am Ethiopian, and I grew up eating (arguably) the highest quality of my country's cuisine. In an effort to expose my Hispanic boyfriend to a part of my culture, I took him to Abyssinia, and we encountered a rather inattentive and condescending waitress who not only took fifteen minutes in between each visit to our table to take orders, ask us how we were doing/if we needed anything, but actually flat-out refused to replace a couple components in our meat combo platter. Now, I would understand if this is  major inconvenience, but I wouldn't have asked for it if A) I was capable of digesting raw meat (kitfo), B) we weren't willing to pay extra, and C) they hadn't customized my order in the past. This happened to us not only once, but TWICE. I was extremely disappointed and completely unsatisfied. My boyfriend did enjoy what little he did get to experience of Ethiopian cuisine, but I'm sure he will be delighted to get the full experience when we take our business elsewhere. Abyssinia has also lowered its standards in giving equal portions of food; the ratio between injera (the tortilla-like bread used to scoop up meats/stews/veggies, etc.) to wot (stews, et al) balanced more heavily on the injera, which, if you've had Ethiopian food, is not the flavorful part of the meal.  Highly disappointed. I doubt I will return."}
{"text":"4* could have been 5.  Delicious fresh and great service. Nice to see the return of a great Ethiopian resto in this end of the Danforth. This establishment replaced a 'hood favourite (gone many years now maybe 5-6), Dukem.   Dined alone so there only so much a gal can eat.   Veg platter -do not pass go...do it Spicy lamb - oh my couldn't finish the veg platter because this was so delicious.  Go you won't be disappointed. One thing I have to say, the tint on the windows has to go, I've walked by here so many times without stopping. I'm sure many other do too."}
{"text":"There are A LOT of Ethiopian restaurants on the SW side of Vegas. If I lived there I'd be on a quest to find my favorite. This place was average. Nothing really jumped out at me aside from larger portions and some dishes were just prepared differently than what I'm used to or didn't have quite as much flavor as other Ethiopian recipes. The only other people in there at the time I went for dinner were Ethiopian, so seemed like a bit of a ethnic local spot which I'm sure gets more packed on a weekend."}
{"text":"The mere thought of glorious, spongey injera bread makes my mouth water. I always leave feeling perfectly full and relaxed.   Abyssinia makes my favorite Ethiopian vegetable dishes beautifully. The servers are always so sweet and don't mind when I order way more injera than someone my size should be eating.  Every person I have ever turned on to Ethiopian food is always extremely pleasantly surprised by it. It is so delicious. I constantly crave it. Ethiopian beer is good as well, and Abyssinia carries it.  This area of Vegas is not the greatest, but you completely forget this once you're inside the restaurant enjoying your meal. I also love the Ethiopian music they play!  Thank you Abyssinia for providing delicious vegan Ethiopian options!"}
{"text":"We went on a weeknight and they were more busy than  when we go during the weekend. We invited my cousin and his family to join us while they were visiting since th ey have never had Ethiopian food before.  We got there early (before my cousin) to reserve tables and to put in our order since I know it takes a while for them to prepare the food. We ordered a spaghetti dish for the kids and a meat and veggie combo for the adults. We did not get the combo platter until almost 2 hours later. We also had to get up form our table to find someone to refill our water. We also asked for more injera and it never came.  I know they were busy but their lack of service was unexcusable. It might be a while before we go back."}
{"text":"Owner is very charming!! The samples were delicious so we decided to order it.... and the food was not the same when it was served! Bummer! Service was not good! We waited about an hour and a half to get our food. I love Ethiopian food.... I wanted to love this place. Expensive, slow service, inconsistent food... But a very charming owner. Don't know if I'll go back."}
{"text":"A local or a guest, get off the strip to this great food. If you're new to Ethiopian, be prepared to scoop up food in bread. That said, it's part of the fun. And no, it's not the sad, overbleached Wonder Bread, it's injera, which is great by itself.   So we had their meat/veggie combo with about 8 dishes and added another veal dish and each was was fresh and full of flavor. Had some Ethiopian beer but it's Vegas, so they do have a full bar.   It's not a fancy place but I think you'll love the food and the good value (not at hotel meal prices)."}
{"text":"This is a great new restaurant I checked out this summer once with my parents and fiance and then recently on my own. It seems that it's a family run business and very well maintained and decorated(which is rare for most Ethiopian restaurants in this city). Very classy. I'd recommend their lamb stew (beg kikil). I was recovering from wisdom teeth so I had to order something less spicy and soft, the veggies were great for that. If you're not Ethiopian, dont worry, the waitress will probably serve you professionally but if you're like me raised here, you may get an eye roll or condescending smirk for not memorizing dish names. I brushed it off a couple times but maybe that certain waitress needs to learn that different people will come into a restaurant, Ethiopian or not, raised abroad  or not. Still gave her a good tip though. I'll be back for the lamb stew, but only because the owners are very hospitable and the food is really good."}
{"text":"Following up on my weekend of amazing foods, I always wanted to have some Ethiopian food here in Las Vegas.  Having had it in San Francisco and in New York, i wanted to have some of it close to home.  What I love about Ethiopian food are three essential things:  a. I can eat with my hands only, b. Many of the foods are stewed or in bite size pieces in a gravy. c. The flavors are so good.  I have to add a fourth, now that the daughter has been a Vegan the past few months and of course, you can get that here in Ethiopian cuisine.  To make this an easy and good experience for the daughter and wife, i simply ordered two dishes, the Meat Combo and the Vegetarian Combo.  The Meat Combo consisted of Beef Tibs, Kitfo, Stewed Lamb, Chicken and another spicy stewed lamb dish.  This was tasty. I had the Kitfo for the first time as it is traditionally prepared which is raw minced and with spices. Yummy!  Loved it. Also, really enjoyed the stewed lamb.  The Veggie Combo, my daughter mostly had, but you know me, I do love the veggies.  It came with a Salad, Ater Kit or Split Peas, Yatakilt or boiled chopped cabbage, Yemisir Wot or Split Red Lentils, Collard Greens and more Chick Peas.  I liked the Lentils and Chick Peas the best.   They give you PLENTY of Injera to soak up all the goodness.  While I enjoyed the combinations, I did that just to make it easy.  Next time, i will focus on specific ordering as I really like stewed lamb and the Kitfo as a few other dishes.  They also serve alcohol here, so that is an added plus. Probably bring some of my friends here. Darn it, now I will really have to wash the hands well.....  The ambiance of this restaurant is interesting. It seems nice, but also a bit commercial or less than cozy.  The restaurants in San Fran and NYC are very cozy, small, uber cool and decorated.  It is an ambiance that transports you as part of the experience. Here, it was okay, just a bit spartan in comparison.  GK says, I am coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Outstanding.  My favorite dishes are Kik Alitcha and Yemesir Wot and they offer both in the veggie combo.  The fit fit isn't spicy.  This is my favorite destination for Ethiopian in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ethiopian food is something I just crave and it's been a good while since I've had my fill.  Abyssinia did a great job of reminding me why I love it so much.  On this visit, we knew exactly what we wanted and found it easily on the menu.  #10 Vegi-Combination (#s 3,4,5,6,7,8,9) $11.99 - This is a great way to experience a large variety of typical Ethiopian vegetarian options.  Although 7 were listed, we actually received a 8 different kinds.  #3 Abyssinia Salad \"Special salad with tomato, onion, jalapeno, touch of fresh garlic with our secret Abyssinia style salad sauce.\" - This is a refreshing salad that was probably the first to be finished.  #4 Ater Kik Alicha \"Mild yellow split peas cooked with onions, oil and garlic with a touch of turmeric and subtle blend of herbs and spices.\"  #5 Yatakilt Alicha \"A delicious vegetable: Boiled chopped cabbage, sliced carrots, and simmered with onions, garlic, ginger, and vegetable oil.\"  #6 Yemisir Wot with Red Pepper \"Split red lentils are stewed with onion garlic, pepper, and a blend of Ethiopian herbs.\"  #7 Yemisir Wot with Turmeric \"Split lentils are stewed with onion, garlic, and a blend of mild Ethiopian herbs.\"  #8 Collared Greens \"Chopped collared greens simmered in a mild sauce of oil, onion, and herbs.\"  #9 Shiro \"Roasted and powdered chick peas are simmered in our unique, hot and spicy berbere sauce with vegetable oil served with injera.\"  There's just something about the way the spices are utilized in Ethiopian stewed dishes that make it all so tasty.  Soaking it all up with injera makes it such a great meal.  The highlight of this dinner was the kitfo, of course.  Since discovering kitfo, I just love it.  #9 Kitfo \"Finely chopped, ground beef with spiced Ethiopian butter, homemade feta cheese, mitmita (spiced red pepper) served with injera. (Served raw, mild, or well done.) $11.99 - Amazingly good.  That's all I can really say about it.  We ordered it raw and I like it with the accompanying red pepper for that little bit of heat.  Overall, their veggie combination and kitfo portions are very generous.  I could easily compare their portions to some of the other Ethiopian restaurants in town and will say theirs is very large.  It was only the Husband and I during this meal, and I still had leftovers for two lunches following.  Don't be shy about asking for more injera too.  There were a few other diners on this Sunday evening, and two waitresses.  When we walked in, we just stood around for a bit until someone told us to sit wherever we liked.  Once we started eating, both waitresses were attentive and asked us often how everything was.  I'll definitely return again."}
{"text":"Went back with a friend yesterday.  As with the first time, the food was great, but basic customer service was lacking (& having been to plenty of other Ethiopian restaurants, I know it's not just a cultural issue).  My friend & I each ordered iced tea, which at  $2.50 each was very pricey, especially since it apparently was just regular iced tea, not Ethiopian iced tea, which I like a lot but they don't have here.  She asked us if we wanted the ice tea sweet or just regular and since I normally put a little sugar into my ice tea I asked for it sweet as did my friend.   What we were served tasted exactly like Nestea powdered iced tea mix, with way too much sugar added to it in fact the bottom of our glasses each had about a quarter of an inch of sugar.  They were simply regular sized glasses of iced tea not huge mugs or a carafe or pitcher of it.  We both eventually asked for refills since we were thirsty despite way too much sugar being in them, and were both shocked and irritated to see that when the bill arrived we were charged another $2.50 for our second glasses of iced tea!   That is utterly ridiculous since their price for iced tea was very high to begin with and the iced tea they made was clearly just some powdered instant iced tea mix.   She did not inform us when we asked for refills that we would be charged for second glasses of iced tea.  We will not be back.   Thankfully there are other Ethiopian restaurants in Las Vegas and I will continue to patronize them instead of this place."}
{"text":"Super disappointed.. I really like Ethiopian food but being my third time here its been the same reoccurring attitude from the workers there and it totally sucks! Every time they completely ignore us until I finally make eye contact, and then they brought out my food without drinks , I had to walk up the bar and ask them for the drinks. Finally 5 minutes later we got them and they were wrong and extremely strong tea.. , but we didnt compain. They were rude as hell, had to get up and ask for service again because they were to busy chatting away. This happens every single time!!! I dont understand why they treat customers differently with respect.. we are in Las Vegas !! There are all races all colors all different types of food and you dont want me in your restaurant even when I am polite as hell, dont complain and tip you. Thats my last time ill ever go there and because of that I advice everyone else not to either."}
{"text":"Not as good as Merkato. They don't give you as much food (or at least not as many different items in a combo), and it's a little more expensive. I'm comparing the Veggie Combo from both places. The Veggie Sambusa here does not compare at all to the veggie sambusa at Merkato. Smaller, less plump/filling, blander, and came with no red mustard sauce (essential).   However, the service and ambience is pretty good here, better than Merkato. Soft, darker lighting, much nicer/newer looking chairs & tables, and good Ethiopian music.  The Ethiopian beer here is pretty good, too!"}
{"text":"This was a really nice reprieve from the madness of the casinos, come one in the morning. I was a bit surprised to find the restaurant completely empty, but it was almost one AM on a Tuesday morning...  The woman who took care of us was very kind and had a (lovely) thick accent.  In regards to the menu, it was mostly the standard fare I've seen for Ethiopian restaurants across the states, plus some extras. Ethiopian coffee and beer, sambusas as appetizers, individual meat and veggie dishes that could be combined into a hefty sampler.   We ordered our regular Ethiopian picks:  Ethiopian beer: B Sambusas: B- (they were just a titch over-cooked and didn't have the traditional chili sauce with them, as well as being a bit minimal on the pastry filling.) Vegetarian sampler: A+ -- the tomato salad and carrot/ cauliflower dishes were better than my fave Ethiopian restaurant offers, while the two lentil dishes and the spinach dish were on par.  My true review of Abyssinia would be 4.5 stars, due to the sub par sambusas (my fave part of the meal) and very dark lighting. But if I lived in Vegas, I'd definitely visit them again."}
{"text":"I love this place and their food! It does not matter if you dine in or take out. They always take great care of their customers. Only reason I don't give it a five is because I always take out. Probably once a week. The food isn't as best as when I dine in and I'm not sure why that is. I can't seem to figure it out. Don't get me wrong. It's still yummy ! And  over all An amazing place ! I love it !!! Might just be the atmosphere too. Never really thought about it lol. Anyways. Everyone should make this their number one Ethiopian restaurant to go to.  I've tried several. Nothing like this place in vegas !"}
{"text":"If you like Ethiopian Food, then you are in for a treat at Abyssinia.  Awesome injera, freshly made was a good start.  There were tow of us and we ordered the Vegetarian platters.  Ingredients were super fresh and spiced nicely.  Really like the T-shirts the staff had that was a play on the \"Welcome to Las Vegas\" sign, but said Welcome to Abyssinia.  Hope they start selling those shirts, will definitely pick some up as gifts!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. I love the different spices, textures, and flavors.   Had the vegetarian combo plate. No animal products used and I appreciate that.   Tasty coffee as expected of an Ethiopian restaurant. Great value as well."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Ethiopian cuisine for a long time now, and this was an amazing first experience. I got the vegetarian platter and it was very flavourful and tasty. The lady that served me was so warm and welcoming. I will definitely be returning to try a different dish."}
{"text":"The restaurant is across from the Orleans. Great food and service. The food came out promptly. Delicious."}
{"text":"I'm as familiar with Ethiopian food as humans' understanding of the mechanics of a singularity. With that prologue, I agreed to try out this place with my friend Adam out of sheer curiosity. This is a casual place with inadequate ventilation so you may smell a little when you leave. Adam suggested that we start with something small and if we like it, we'll order more. What a great idea that was! The vegetable combination platter that we ordered, although seemed small, was so filling that we were stuffed after going through a quarter of it.   You get four-five items sitting on top of a bread called injera. There were collard greens, stewed lentils and three different types of stewed peas: a mild version (yellow), a medium spicy version (orange) and a super tangy and spicy version (red). The mild peas and collard greens were sooooooo good! I loved them. I'm not into lentils so I skipped that while the red peas were the strangest thing I've ever tried.  It had such a strong kick to its taste, and did I mention how spicy this particular item was?!!   Injera, the bread, came in a basket; a bundle of fluffy spongy goodness for you to tear up and dip into the stewed vegetables. I've never had anything quite like it. It was subtle and strange and yet very much agreeable with my palate!   I wouldn't mind coming back here again. What an experience that was!"}
{"text":"I adored the family vibe. The staff was friendly. I definitely am more of a fan of Ethiopian Diamond in Chicago.   This place was definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"When one Ethiopian cab driver recommends a good Ethiopian restaurant, I took note... When a second Ethiopian cab driver says it's the best Ethiopian in Las Vegas, I figured I should check it out. The service was spotty, but the food was very tasty! The lamb was delicious. I've been to several Ethiopian restaurants, but I am by no means an expert on Ethiopian food... But, I would say the food here might be a notch above par. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"...not sure what to say...I have been here a million times and love the food....that said you will never see any white boys or american blacks....just ethiopians....come with a sense of adventure- if not might be a big fail with a large part of your group....just sayn"}
{"text":"My sister and I have been searching for a great Ethiopian restaurant to regular here in Las Vegas, we're both vegan and Ethiopian  food is  my favorite!  I tried one other place here in town and was really disappointed. Coming from San Francisco where we have so many we couldn't be happier to finally find a great spot like abysinnia!  We ordered the veggie combo and was more then enough for the two of us, everything was delicious! Abysinnia was very busy for a Tuesday night! They even had the NBA warriors game on, I will definitely be back and look forward to bringing my friends and family.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5, is because I like my injera  (the wet bread used to scoop up your food) warm and it was served cold  Here is to hoping upon request that I can get it hot next time!"}
{"text":"Terrible service waitress was extremely rude never helped us unless we physically got up and found her. She forgot to put our food order in n we were waiting for almost an hour before we got up to finally leave. Don't waste your $ or"}
{"text":"We were visiting from Seattle and we were looking forward to some good Ethiopian food. Came across Abyssinia. We decided to ignore the reviews about the service staff since mostly such restaurants do not have good speaking staff or even we didn't care much about the ambience as long as the food was good. When we entered the restaurant there was loud music being played which was annoying. It can really give you a headache with the loud bass. I respect others culture and music but not when it's getting shoved into my face (in this case ears). The food looked great...on paper and in pictures. When the food arrived, it was cold. We ordered the vegetarian platter, a sambusa and tea. Off the three only the tea and sambusa felt freshly made and the sambusa came partly burnt. Anyways, we know where we aren't supposed to be eating next."}
{"text":"Great service with a smile. If you don't know what to order they're happy to help you and even recommend a dish or two. The food is just amazing! Such a great find!"}
{"text":"This was my first foray into Ethiopian fare. Let me tell you I was impressed. We ordered a combination plate and a extra lamb dish on the side. The blend of spices was amazing. The spongie bread was unique.i loved trying all the dishes. Coming here really urned dinner into an experience.  The restaurant itself was unimpressive. The decor was simple and the waitress didn't leave a lasting impression. All in all I'd go back. It was fun. A highlight to what would have been a boring meal."}
