{"text":"My mom likes to visit Magic Wok whenever we visit Toronto.  I can see why.  They have multiple tanks filled with fresh seafood.  This is like any typical Chinese family style restaurant.  All group tables are round and the smaller tables are square.  It was loud and the restaurant was pack.  We were seated rather quickly since they had the big round table available.

My family ordered a variety of seafood.  Two extremely huge lobsters, two dungess crab, conch with fried tofu, snails, fish, chicken, veggies, and steamed oysters.  The lobsters was the best.  They were served Hong Kong style with cheese.  I haven't had that in ages!  The favors were full and I wasn't thirsty after the meal.  Usually Chinese restaurants uses way too much MSG, but this place was okay.  

The only problem I have with this place is they charge for sauce.  That's right.  If you ordered steam fish, they'll charge you for salt, soy sauce, ginger, and the scallions.  I'm not kidding.  I wish they let me take a picture of the \"sauce\" menu.  That way I can post it.  Who the hell charge for sauce?  This is why this place only gets two stars."}
{"text":"I went to this place based on the good rating from a Chinese Cusine website during my vacation.   What a big mistake!  I will never go back and You ARE ALL WARNED!


This place is under staffs with both chefs and waiters.  They are definitely not well managed at all.  They are 100% unappologetically only care for the big tables.  

Facts:   There were 4 other small tables in that evening beside us.  All of us small tables were completely ignored and our first dishes did not showed up until 35-45 minutes later.  Mean while, all the other big tables orders were served right away even they showed up 15-25 minutes after us.

Facts:  We purposely only ordered Chef specials and waiter's recommendations because we want to get the best.  After 45 minutes of waiting for our first dish. Tat supposely Special Satay Sauces Fry Clams were really sub par. Word cannot expressed how disappointing and underwhelmed we were.  We had better from a mediocre restaurant at Flushing Queens New York.  

Second dish came 10 minutes later.  It supposed to be the Chef Special \"Home Town Special Pepper Salt  Fried Tofu\".  I can get more taste from chewing a piece of tissue.


By now we have had enough. We canceled the rest of the 2 dishes. The waiter admited they have not even started to cook anyway.   We went to a small Maylesian Home Restaurant and had the best Pad Thai ever!

Do not go there!"}
{"text":"make sure you try their sizzling chicken. ambience is not that great beside large window seating all around. I  do have fetish for their food here and there, so I drop by whenever I am in the area. garlic shrimps are awesome but please ask them to be easy on the sodium. I find this place a little over priced but hey the food is fantastic cant complain."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Maybe we came on an off day (Tuesday after Thanksgiving, everyone must have been still working on their turkey), but the restaurant was only half full, so we didn't have to fight for a table like the other reviewers. The food was variable but generally ok:
- crab: good flavour but very greasy
- chicken: good taste, but slightly dry; the person who chopped it didn't do a very good job, it was kind of in a pile in the middle of the plate, and there was a more than usual number of stray bone slivers
- taro duck: very good, it was finished off even though it was one of the last plates to arrive
- steamed fish: ok, not fantastic, but not subpar
- ying yang rice: good taste, the sauce was a bit more starchy than I like

Overall, the flavours were pretty good, I just prefer the lower grease levels that other Canadian-Canto restaurants have moved towards since the last decade or so.

Service was pretty good, no complaints here."}
{"text":"We come here on average about once every two weeks for consistently good authentic Chinese food.  Our regularly dishes are always good (chicken breast in black sauce, pork chop in chef's special sauce, beef and vegetable chow mein, lobster with ginger and green onion, Cantonese style steak, and oysters in spicy salt).  However, when we try something different usually from the fish tanks, it can get expensive and is not always up to our expectations."}
{"text":"Inconsistent at times, regarding all aspects. 
But it usually tastes good. 
Expect your clothes to smell like cooking oil after leaving!

I would give 4 stars if service were more attentive and the dishes were more consistent."}
{"text":"The food was very good, but the service was pretty slow.  There's not enough staff.  We were situated in the corner and when we managed to flag a waiter over, the near by tables took the opportunity to ask them for assistance too.  In the entire restaurant, maybe there were 5 waiters.  

Our food mainly came all together but it took us a while to get the complimentary soup.  We had to ask two times.  One waiter even asked if we didn't want the complimentary soup to which was very confusing cause usually they ask if we want it.  The waiters looked very tired.  

The food was good but it is more expensive compared to other Chinese restaurants around the area."}
{"text":"Magic Wok attracts repeat customers for good reason - their food is authentic Cantonese fare, with fresh ingredients and tends to be low in MSG compared to other establishments (even in their soups and sauces!).

Some notable dishes: 
- Chinese broccoli with shrimp, scallops, and squid
- fried grouper stewed with tofu and cabbage
- smoked chicken (their signature dish)
- shrimp, scallops, and squid on a hot metal plate
- deep-fried duck covered in mashed taro (tastes awesome, but probably not healthy)
- fried ribs in sweet sauce

Dinner here comes with complimentary soup and dessert (either red bean, green bean, taro with tapioca, or tofu dessert). 

Don't order the fried noodles and rice here, though. I don't know how you can mess these up while acing the vegetable/meat dishes, but they do. 

The waitstaff are friendly and do their best to fill your order fast. Sometimes this is impossible on busy days, but busy days are harder to come by now that more Chinese restaurants keep popping up around Markham."}
{"text":"Had a 8 dish set meal, was enough for 10 people for $126.  

-Seafood Soup
-Sweet and Sour pork
-Scallop with greens
-Steamed fish
-Lobster - ehh...oooh kay
-Some rotisserie chicken with some sauce - Tastes pretty good
-Duck covered with taro and deep fried - nothing to write home about, more taro than duck

Complimentary dessert - red bean and small tapioca (EXCELLENT)

Everything was pretty fresh and most importantly hot (temperature) when it came out.

Taste wise, it's pretty much taste like any other cantonese cuisine.

Service was pretty fast and efficient, and both of the waiters we dealt spoke english.

Will go again."}
{"text":"Not entirely sure how such a busy restaurant can punch out dishes so fast. Good authentic Chinese restaurant that I would come back to.

A good dish is the mango chicken in bird's nest (don't worry my bird loving friends, it's not a real bird's nest)."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever.

Consistently.

I don't know what it is about this place, but the management really does not care at all about customer service and, consequently, neither do the wait staff. 

A normal sit down meal always turns into a 2 hour + ordeal of trying to place an order, waiting for the food, trying to get rice, trying to get dishes that didn't come, trying to get more tea, trying to pay the bill, waiting and waiting for them to bring the bill, waiting and waiting for them to process it, waiting and waiting for change, waiting and waiting for takeout containers. WAITING. They should change the name of this place to Waiting Wok cuz there ain't no magic here.

The ridiculosity of having 3 overworked wait staff and 1 incompetent cashier on a Saturday night dinner service cannot be overstated. It is ridiculous. Adding insult to injury, the table full of middle-aged white folk who sat down 30 minutes after us got all smiles and bows, their soup AND main dishes before we did (and, might as well have gotten their backs rubbed). And we ordered first.

It's a shame too because their food is really good and the portion sizes are great. The bird's nest with mango is always a hit; we get it every time we (make the mistake to) visit.

The parking lot is another weird vortex of ridiculousness. I don't even know what to say about this place other than the fact that they're damn lucky their food is good because everything else in that place is shambolic."}
{"text":"According to my dad, Magic Wok was one of the first Chinese restaurant in Toronto around 30 years ago but they were at a different location.  They moved to this location a while back as well. I been here around 5-6 times and I don't know what the hype is all about.  The place is always packed but I do not find the food that big of a deal; taste like regular Chinese food you can find anywhere.  Magic Wok is pretty dirty and decor is plain. Seating is cramped and service is crap as they seem to be understaffed.  Magic Wok was good back in the days with no real competition but it is 2012 and we have Chinese restaurants every block of the city that I believe is better than this old timer.

{"text":"Have seen and heard about this place many times in the past, and finally came in recently for family dinner. The restaurant is a building all alone in what feels like the middle of nowhere. It's got an interesting round building shape and the neon sign brightly reads \"Magic Wok\", though in Chinese it says \"Magic Lamp\" (confusing, I know). Seven people, 6:30pm, Saturday - I was expecting the place to be full to the brim with people given the positive reputation it has for seafood and Chinese food in general. I arrived at a rather empty shop, but I thought hey, it's really cold out today and it's still early. The décor is simple, pale walls, green trim, signage promoting seasonal specials, chef recommendations, and fresh seafood in the tanks. Things are not new, but not too shabby - some may find it subpar but it's reminiscent of a Chinese restaurant that's been around for a while with modest decorations and modest prices to match.

We ordered steamed fish, a lamb chop casserole, grandfather half chicken, and some greens. There was a bit of a wait as the fish takes some time, but food arrived just before we got too bored, and everything came around the same time. The fish was the highlight - steamed just right, traditional style with pork and Chinese mushroom slices on top to add flavour. Not too dry, but not raw on the inside. Price was is comparable to other restaurants, but the cooking was better and made the spending more worthwhile. The lamb chop casserole was a bit on the dry side, but the sauce was flavourful - bordering on too salty for some palates! The grandfather chicken refers to the cooking style - roasted and baked, with soy sauce and sesame seeds, and what tasted like a bit of Korean barbecue sauce.

Overall not a bad spot for some traditional-style Chinese food, casual family style that's not too fancy, where the food comes first and décor comes third. The location of the restaurant makes it less accessible, but luckily there does appear to be sufficient parking."}
{"text":"Two words: ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. 

Came here knowing that it is a very popular Chinese restaurant in the area and I must regretfully say, I was utterly disappointed, actually, DISGUSTED. 

The service is absolutely terrible. Came in and was seated quite quickly, however, nobody came by our table for a good 20 minutes though we have already made our order. We waved to several waiters however we were IGNORED on all occasions until one waiter happened to come by while seating some other guests. 

Their attitude is RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL, slamming down the tea pot at our table without looking at us at all. And they get away from our table faster than we can ask for more tea or rice. 

The food came EXTREMELY slowly. We waited a good 40-50 minutes for our lobster to finally come (when the other dishes we ordered came 30 minutes ago), so we basically sat there waiting for half an our with nothing to eat. 

I highly recommend that NOBODY come to this restaurant in the future, as we know we will most definitely be NEVER COMING BACK. In all my years, I have never attended such an ATROCIOUS restaurant. Do not be fooled by the long line ups... It is simply popular among the Asian community as it holds a long standing reputation of being a \"good\" restaurant. However, as many have noted, the quality now is absolutely horrid. The food was gladly not AS terrible as the service, but given the terrible service, it is 100% not worth it, and will leave you sorely DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but they had some of the worst service around. Even with a reservation, we waited 2 hours for seating. They seemed very interested in only helping out their regular customers and not much interest in establishing new ones."}
{"text":"Slow, forgets your order, and runs out of most things on the menu. Used to be excellent about a decade ago but sadly, this restaurant did not age gracefully. The food is decent, but the service could be much better. Lobsters are good, clams not so much, and sea bass is fairly fresh. This place could use a major renovation to freshen up the experience."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for an early Thanksgiving dinner and was utterly disappointed. Due to my youthful glow, I was designated to sit at the \"kids table\" and as you would presume, the majority of our dishes were deep fried. On top of poor presentation, bland tastes, and ultimately unappetizing food, the food costs were on the upper-end. I will very unlikely come back. Also, special shout out to the deep fried taro duck which was unfortunately the worst thing I've eaten in the past month. It was dry, flavorless, and the duck was barely detectable. Even the accommodating sauce was flavorless..!

This place used to be a family favorite but that was over 15 years ago. Hah, this place is in shambles now with less than a quarter of the restaurant filled during prime dinner time..."}
{"text":"Service was quite disappointing, but the food made up for it.

This is one of our family go to Chinese restaurants.  It has been around for over 10+ years and is a staple for many families for dinner.  We came here for dinner the night before the Lunar New Year, so we expected it to be busy.  We made reservations in advance for a table for 14 at 7:30pm.

We got there on time, but still had to wait until 8pm.  That was the first strike.
We sat down, and they started us off with the soup, which was good, most likely because we were all starving.  It was pork bone boiled with radishes and cabbages.  After the soup, it took them maybe 20-25 minutes to bring out the other dishes.  Second strike.

As we progress through the meal, the dishes were brought out in spurts.  First 3 together, then another 3 after 20 minutes, then another 3 after another 20 minutes.  Usually at a Chinese restaurant, they would bring out all dishes relatively closer within each other but considering it's one of their busiest nights of the year, I guess they miss the ball on this one.

Let's talk about some of the food:
Cheese Lobster (twin lobsters covered in cheese, this is their signature dish for $26. Probably one the best dishes they make there, it never disappoints.  Very flavorful and enough to share with everyone)

Ginger Lobster (twin lobsters, marinated with ginger, garlic, and green onions, also $26.  Not a personal favourite but this is also one of their signatures)

Tai Yeh Chicken (Another one of their best dishes, the chicken is very tender, goes well with steamed rice, served with pickled radishes and the jellyfish strands)

Tofu Spinach (Vegetarian dish, the tofu is egg tofu, which is super smooth. The spinach underneath is cooked perfectly)

Pork Hock (This is not easy to make, but I feel like they still could have done better, the fat/meat parts were tough and not fall-off-the-bone, they drenched the entire dish in sauce to make up for it, not the best idea)

Sweet & Sour Beef (Very common dish, the pieces of meat were too large so we had to cut it up ourselves, onions were undercooked, again, too much sauce)

Mango Chicken in Bird's Nest (Mangoes were a bit sour, chicken was done right though, this comes recommended to try!)

After we finished, we asked for dessert, and unfortunately, they ran out - so were given 2 plates of sliced oranges.  Not exactly what we expected, which I deem as the third strike. After making us wait an extra 30 minutes, when we had a full party of 14, then prolonging our hunger after we sat, and followed by no dessert, this is probably not my go-to restaurant anymore.  But when I do come back, hopefully, they'll improve the service aspect sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"this place is known for the grandfather smoked chicken and the variety of seafood. i havent noticed too much change in quality as ive been going since i was a little kid. it has gotten slightly more expensive but still a very authentic and good tasting restaurant"}
{"text":"Magic Wok is a dinner only establishment that our family has frequented for many years. They are known for their seafood. Some of the dishes that we order when we come here are the deep fried oysters, lobster, crab with vermicelli noodles (off the menu), duck with taro (which can be really heavy in your stomach), and sweet and sour pork. They give free house soup, and free dessert which may include bean curd or red bean soup. 

This restaurant is really showing its age and could use some decor updates. Service also is hit and miss. There can be noticeable swings in the quality of food, say if you dine on a weekday versus the weekend (when their regular chef is working ). 

There are other Chinese restaurants in the area that we could go to, but there are also some tried and true menu items that we have not found elsewhere. For that reason, we will probably continue to come occasionally to Magic Wok.

(90/100)"}
{"text":"Magic Wok, indeed! It's crowded and the service was not that great, but the Cantonese food was stupendous. First, your meal at Magic Wok starts off with a bowl of complimentary pork soup, which is nice and unctuously delicious. Our family style entrees included spicy lobster (absolutely amazing), beef tenderloin (so succulent and delicious), the most tender chicken... my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Complimentary dessert, too -- during my visit, it was a red bean soup. So yum. 

It can get very crowded here, so your best bet is to come early."}
{"text":"This place never seems to disappoint, however if you go there, be prepared to show up with a reservation of else you'll be waiting.  They used to have their location in scarborough, but then moved up closer to my NECK of the woods...in Markham.  The food is always fresh and you can taste the quality in their food.  I totally am in love with their Chinese hot pots, and fish.  The staff are always fast and efficient!"}
{"text":"After my last visit, I told myself I wouldn't be back but I got invited to celebrate a friend's birthday. Immediately, I noticed a difference in the service. It was a lot faster and a bit friendlier. I suspect, however, that our host is a regular diner here and she had pre-ordered our dishes. Nonetheless, there was an improved difference in the service.

The table of four next to us, though, might have a different opinion. They had finished their first two dishes completely and waited quite a while before their next two dishes were served. It sounded like the servers or kitchen had forgotten them. Hmmm.

The food was better than my last visit but still nowhere near where it used to be, although they still manage to pack the restaurant. The fried crab was overcooked, dry, and salty. The lobster was bland. The noodles in the Cantonese chow mein were slightly burnt. The crispy chicken, fried fish, and pork loin with chef's special sauce were good. The rest of the dishes were average.

Overall, the misses still outweigh the hits and it's hard for me to come back."}
{"text":"It is getting tough to rate Magic Wok.  I really want to give it more stars, but I have to settle with 3 stars.
We came here for a group dinner with 9 adults and 1 child.  We ordered a set menu for 8 people.
Food - big portion.  All dishes tasted consistently good.  I didn't taste loads of MSG and I am quite sensitive, so I suppose they did not use much MSG.  Unfortunately, nothing really shined, or was impressive or special.
Service - Slow but this was not the fault of the waitresses but more of the restaurant seriously under staffed
Magic Wok has had a reputation of wok-air.  I didn't taste it, or it was not particularly better than other restaurants.
So here it goes - a okay"}
{"text":"Although Magic Wok's location is tucked away in quietness from the busy Kennedy, I still managed to find you after all this time!  I remember coming here with my parents more than 10 yrs ago and then again 6 yrs ago when I returned with a friend and just recently 2 weeks ago.  The food is still amazing for family style and I'm glad it hasn't changed.  Still as busy as ever!  Magic Wok, I've made you and Congee Wong both part of my Must Stops anytime I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been coming here to Magic Wok since I was a kid.  I remember their old Scarborough location which was always crowded and the waiter who spilled sauce on my dad's expensive new shoes.

Fast forward to a few decades later, and the core wait staff is still the same!  The brother and sisters all look the same.  My parents know one of the waiters, Happy, from another chinese restaurant location down the street.  I thought they were pretty good.  Like a typical chinese restaurant, the service is usually very quick and efficient.  Just don't expect them to come to your table and ask how the food is every few minutes.

The food here has always been excellent for the price.  Whether it's seafood, veggies, meat, really can't go wrong.   I would say they are best known for their lobster.  $14/lb during the summer can't be beat.  Oh, and it's fresh and cooked well too (stirfry ginger with green onion, curry, etc).  

They always have dessert, usually red bean, sweet almond paste, or \"tofu fa\".  If they run out, they'll give you a sliced orange.

Just a note though, Magic Wok is still only open for dinner.  They make enough money during dinner that they don't need to open for breakfast or lunch.  It's always busy during weekends, so patience is required (reservations don't really help)."}
{"text":"I came here on one of my dinner club friend's recommendation this past weekend.  We were a group of 8 adults and 5 kids and as most Chinese restaurants do, they put us on a table that was way too small so we barely had any elbow room.  Compounded by the kids' need to run free, the setting was not the most comfortable for a relaxing meal.  

Since we ordered a set menu for 8 people (10 dishes) with some substitutions, I'll do my best to list all the dishes.  We started out with soup with yummy morsels of shrimp, chicken and tofu in a clear chicken broth (thickened).  The flavour was good but as one of our friends mentioned it, \"the broth was very chicken-y.\"  Perhaps a little more ginger could have solved this problem??  Then we received our carved duck plate (standard, nothing to write home about), garlic stir-fried gai-lan (with a beautiful crunch), chicken with eggplant in hot pot (tad on the oily side but still good), ginger and green onion Lobster (I didn't bother with this as I was not in the \"finger food\" mood), whole steamed fish with ginger and scallion (my mother in law makes it better at home), beef fried noodle with bean sprouts (a must have for the kiddies), snowpea leaves stir-fried in egg white sauce with a hundred year old egg (or is it a thousand years???) and a silken tofu in ginger syrop (standard, a little less sweet than usual which was good). 

Out of everything we tried that night, the stir fried snowpea leaves was my favorite dish.  I've never had snow pea leaves cooked in egg white sauce, let alone with a hundres year old egg topping.  The result was a well balanced dish with lots of fantastic flavours and textures.  LOVED IT!

Since our host asked the food to be less salty and less oily, our dinner was just perfectly seasoned for our group.  I found at least one of the dishes to be too oily still but that's just one dish out of 10, so not bad.  

I've read some Yelp reviews mention their service being slow but we didn't have this problem.  I will definitely consider this place if I'm ever back in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Chinese restaurant. Went on a Monday night and service was quite slow. After ordering the food it took at least 25 minutes to get our food.

Chicken and eggplant $13
Taro bird nest with mixed seafood $16.50
Beef Tenderloin with onions $18.50
Sweet and sour beef $13

Everything was pretty good but one dish that stood out was the beef tenderloin. The meat was soft and tender however the portion was a bit on the small side. 

$2 for each bowl of rice

The food is good but pricier than other Chinese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Throwback to the divey Chinese restaurant era of the 90s, and surprisingly not much has changed. Except maybe the portions which seem smaller these days. However that could be, because the last time I was here I was considered to be a small fry. 

This place is famous for their Cantonese style food. My favorite dish was always their salt/pepper deep fried squid and on my last visit I tried their taro stuff duck, which was so good that you know it's bad for you.

The decor of this place hasn't changed, so it does look really run down, and you shouldn't look for an upscale, attentive experience from the servers; mainly because you won't get it. It's typical Chinese style service, as to what you would get back in the mid-90s. Hurried, inattentive, etc. But usually coming to this place, my expectations on service isn't high to begin with. Even if you have a reservations, don't expect them to hold the table for you, since they do get pretty busy...  My visit before my most recent one, was a two hour wait with reservations, just to give you an idea. They do brisk business, but whether or not get seated at a table if you have made a reservation ahead of  time during peak hours is another matter altogether.

The parking lot here could use a resurfacing, becaus it's pitted with potholes and there isn't enough parking for the capacity that they do have to begin with; but once again the food is usually good enough to override any qualms on the details."}
{"text":"A little bit of downtown Chinatown in the middle of a commercial park in midtown Markham! Comes complete with bright green wood trimming, table clothes with loose threads all around the edges (could only be improved upon if they used disposable white plastic tablecloths!), and subtle neon red and green lights hidden behind he floral print curtains that frame the many windows. 

Along the bar is the requisite plastic plant and a lonely bottle of Stella Artois reminding you that if you came here for the drinks, you came to the wrong place. At the far end of the bar is the Fortune Cat, reflecting upon better times. 

And don't forget about the dirty, salt stained aquarium that proudly displays assorted fish, crabs, and lobsters. All our aquarian friends are swimming tiredly in resignation to their culinary fate. 

The overworked wait staff are all apologetically swamped. Good luck getting your bill at the end of the meal, let alone a refill on your tea. 

So this is not the place to take someone on a first date. This is also not the best place to bring a young kid. The washrooms... have character. And the space can get quite cramped when the restaurant gets busy, so a restless kid running down the aisles won't work well. On the they hand, when your kid starts throwing a fit, the ambient chatter will drown him or her out. 

All that said, Magic Wok exudes old school character. The food is slow to come, but quite good. The seafood is fresh and done well. Every meal comes with complimentary soup and dessert, both of good quality."}
{"text":"Came for dinner tonight (Tuesday) with the memories of a once great and popular establishment but was sorely disappointed. I give 1 star for a couple ups that are outlined below and another half for not being completely inedible so it's really a 1.5 rating. 

We ordered the fried duck stuffed with taro, beef tenderloin with sweet and sour sauce, snow pea sprouts with garlic, fried soft shell crab, eel with honey garlic sauce, and e-fu noodles. Only the sprouts and eel were alright. The duck had no duck and was mostly taro. The beef tenderloin was lacking in flavour and the texture was not good - didn't taste like tenderloin quality meat. The onions and sauce was good but for $18.50 I expect to have more than 8 pieces of mediocre meat covered in good sauce. Fried soft shell crab was a good size but again lacked in flavour. It was supposed to be salt and pepper with spices but nada. The e-fu noodles were soggy and, at the risk of repeating myself again, flavourless. I have made better at home. 

The only upsides were the complimentary soup that came beforehand, which was nice and hot and had loads of flavour, and \"tofu fa\" dessert that was very smooth and one of my favourite Chinese desserts. 

Our bill came to $120 before tip for 5 people. At $25/person for this quality of Chinese food is ridiculous and we will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever and it's still crazy busy. Here's why:  FOOD IS GOOD! Yep simple as that. It's not cheap nor high end pricing, about average Chinese restaurant, but I would say ambiance is a bit lacking, not the nicest place to treat guests or have family dinners.  It's also crazy packed during dinner hours so you may have to hunt for parking (always), wait for a table (usually), and witness the case of the missing server (likely). it's expected for a super busy restaurant though but my mom swears they have the best tofu jelly (do fu hua) in town (free dessert), and one of the best taro sago dessert (also free dessert). They also give out free soup (bao tang) and being Chinese, free gives you an extra star! We like free things especially if they're good. 

Overall, I think this place will be around for awhile. Consistent good food and decent pricing."}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday evening and it was not too busy. The server was friendly but as others have mentioned the service can be slow. We ordered sweet and sour pork, crispy chicken and veggies. They gave us soup to start. The sweet and sour pork was delicious, probably one of the best I've ever had. It's just too bad the portion was a bit smaller than other places. The chicken was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. We got a tofu desert at the end of the meal. The price was pretty much the same as other places. Will return. The only thing they need is to do a good renovation since the style is outdated."}
{"text":"These guys have been around for years. Originally located at Brimley and Sheppard in Scarborough in the early 90s they relocated to their present location off 14th and Kennedy in Markham.

With most places once they move the quality of food changes... not these guys. They have managed to maintain top quality and staff regardless. 

The food is amazing. Whatever you order you will not be disappointed. 

If a restaurant had a cult following... these place would be top of the list.

If you're going their on a weekend... make reservations. The hours are a bit odd so call and find out... they usually open around 4pm on week days til 10 or 11pm"}
{"text":"Yes, things are on the pricey side here, but only with the seafood dishes. Don't worry you will get your money worth, as dishes are of good size and well made.
Be aware, if you order seafood that are not in the standard menu (like steamed fish or dishes made with one of the \"by weight\" seafood) they do charge a surcharge on top of the cost of the seafood. They have been doing that since as long as I can remember. I think they started because during the fishing season, people will bring in their own bounty. They will then just charge the same surcharge in those cases."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I went there expecting excellent food. Sadly, it was disappointing. The food was below average. The seafood - scallops and prawns weren't fresh. The crispy duck and Yeung Chou fried rice was below average. The only decent dish was the Chinese broccoli. 

I sense it's one of those places that had some glory a few years back but is now pretty run down. Service staff were very nice and friendly. Maybe their chef moved on because the reviews and photos certainly didn't match what landed on our plates."}
{"text":"Okay, first things first- I'm Asian. So I've had years upon years of Asian food. At home and at restaurants. 

Never have I had to sit through such horrid customer service. 

Positive notes are that they were courteous, polite, and offered great explanations of dishes.

Until. 

We ordered a Seafood Noodle dish (lack of better terms- Ho Fun)

It was bland, poorly cooked, and it seems like it was left on the flames for too long that it stuck together in lumps as shrivelled up bits of noodle. I've always ordered this dish with my family and this is the first time I've seen it be this poorly done. 

When my mom called them to question the dish- both employees that came over had poor attitudes and seemed to not want to deal with us. They kept telling us it was fine and that was how the dish was supposed to be. Nope. I doubt that. 

Furthermore, I could SEE them talking about us as we ate. (Yes, I'm writing this and I'm HERE at present time) now, my family still tries to be uber polite so we dropped it for the most part. They were nicer afterwards, but I'm still rather unimpressed. 

The two stars barely made the mark. 

Step up your game, come on!"}
{"text":"Magic Wok seems to almost always be packed - a mid-sized restaurant serving pretty standard Chinese food that I would consider above average in taste and quality.  Price is fair and portions are just normal.  Would go back again for semi-regular family functions."}
{"text":"Great food, portions, service and price!  Recommend making reservations on the weekends."}
{"text":"Been coming to these guys for years. They offer some authentic chinese food with wok hay.  Many of the dishes are prepare fresh so be prepare to wait for 1 dish at a time. If you are in a rush please don't visit this place as food does take time to prepare. 




1. No service, you come to a Chinese restaurant for good Chinese food
2. Top dish Sweet and Sour Pork, Chinese Beef and Broccoli
3. Decor same old green wall, at least the washroom is clean."}
{"text":"Ah well, what to say another Chinese restaurant.... If you read in between the lines, slow service, rude, poor food quality.... But seriously.... It's a Chinese restaurant!   This place is always packed and has been here for ages... So either the restaurant is wrong, or the people writing the reviews have eaten at Panda Express way too much. 

 To highlight some of the main things... Lobster is nice but their steamed fish... My god. Every-time i visit this place i have to get the fish. It is a draw dropping dish that separates itself from the rest of the Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Food is still good, but they do need to hire more people on the floor! And also the kitchen can keep you waiting and waiting when it gets busy, many times like that I would have to finish the whole meal by taking one dish at a time. Imagine the bowl of rice turning ice cold when the last dish arrived."}
{"text":"I rarely eat Chinese food for 2 reasons: 1. Their service is usually guaranteed sucky. 2. The place is almost always filthy. Now I don't want to further the stereotypes for Chinese restaurants, but I have to admit that the culture is different within one compared to others. As someone who admires, appreciates, and recognizes good service, I tend to stay away from Chinese restaurants. Nonetheless, with a grandma who eats nothing but Chinese food, I came to this place on a weekend night for her birthday.

The place was pretty full at 8:15pm on a Saturday night and they were clearly understaffed since half the tables were not cleaned up yet. We stood around trying to get ANY server's attention but they kept waving us away. 5 minutes later, they finally ask how many of us there were and started to clean the table closest to the door for us. I requested to be seated elsewhere and the server said there was no other place (even though a family just left and nearly half the place was empty because of dirty tables). Then I pointed out an empty table for 4 (that's us), and asked to be seated there. 10 minutes later, we finally get seated. There are no English signs anywhere in the restaurant aside from \"open,\" but thankfully, the menu had English and since we didn't know how to write Chinese, we just wrote the numbers down. We had the following:

1. Tofu and Snow Pea Leaves ($18) - loved this because the tofu is usually fried at other places but it's super soft here. It was also delicious with the sauce and the combination of tofu and snow pea leaves is perfect! I have to say though, it's overpriced. 

2. Grandfather Chicken (half size $13.75) - don't ask me if grandfather chicken means that it's actually a grandfather chicken because I have no clue. Certain parts of the chicken were pretty good and juicy, but the breast was way too dry. I liked that it was served with jellyfish because I love that! Pretty decent size for the price.

3. Scallops and Mangos on Bird Nest ($18.75) - don't be alarmed by the bird nest. This is not the traditional bird nest delicacy made from bird spit - this was a mimic of it made of fried taro, which gave the dish a really good texture. The mango was the perfect accompaniment of sour with the sweet scallops. I really enjoyed this dish. 

The server also gave us free soup (carrot and pork stew) and dessert (hot read bean soup) and we paid for 2 bowls of rice. We didn't get our first dish until around 25 minutes after we put in our order and the 2 tables beside us were full of people until we put in our order and the dirty tables stayed uncleared for almost the entirety of our meal, which I find disgusting and unappetizing. 

All in all, I'm quite sad to have to rate this a two because I would want to come back for the food, I really do. However, I can't put up with mediocre service and a filthy atmosphere - it just makes the dining experience dreadful for me. Nevertheless, if you're okay with all that, definitely try the dishes that I mentioned or be adventurous and try something different!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Cantonese food places in Toronto.  It is consistent in quality and taste.  It has been this way for the last twenty years.  There are so many good dishes and I am not sure where to start?

The Bird's nest is excellent.  Also they have a Smokey chicken that is also delicious.  They also have great steamed oysters.  One of the key things about this place is they have extremely hot woks (using gas) that allows the food to come out nice and hot.  Many restaurants lack this sort of heat.  

This place is the kind of authentic place were you find 95% Asians in the restaurant.  There is usually a lineup during prime dinner times.  

Check it out.  You wont be dissapointed."}
{"text":"My sister-in-laws family used to be regulars here a few years back and liked it, so when we had a bunch of family visiting form out of town we took them here for dinner.

OMG. Someone wrote a review that it took them 3 hours to eat there.  I though this was an exaggeration from a dissatisfied customer.  Well, we discovered that this is pretty accurate.  Were got there a 6:30 and placed our order right away.  Plates came out very, very slowly - sometimes 20-30 minutes in between.  At one point, over 40 minutes went by with nothing showing up. My sister went ask about the delay and was told 2 more minutes. By 9:15 we had still not received 2 of our dishes and asked them about it - again, 2 more minutes.  When the plates finally showed up no one was hungry because of the wait, and because by that point we had stuffed ourselves with rice in desperation.

Many reviewers mention the rude staff.  I think it's more of a matter of them being understaffed, and over worked.

The place is very tired as has not been updated in a very long time.  Plates and glasses are chipped and scratched (we drank out beer from the bottle because the glasses looked questionable).

I have eaten in many chinese restaurants in the marham and richmond hill area.  By comparison, the food here was so so. Way too salty, and many dished overly saucy.   

What really astounded us was how busy the place was.  Mediocre food, slow, unfriendly service, dated  dining room..... and the place was packed!   Perhaps this is part of the appeal for many dinners -  a nostalgic trip back to a crowed, noise, greasy spoon back in the old country.  Oh well, not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"I drive by Magic Wok everyday to work for the past few years and never had a chance to try it, It's hidden in a industrial area and has been in business forever so I thought the food must be good for them to be able to survive this long... boy was I wrong...

Coming in on a long weekend, the place was only half-full - which is the first sign of a   mediocre place. We asked for iced water from 3 different servers and it wasn't brought out until mid-meal.

My family of 6 ordered about 10 dishes to share. The first dish came out promptly in 10 minutes... 2nd dish in 20 minutes... and the 3rd dish in 40 minutes.. we were pickiing on one dish one at a time until by the 4th dish we were already almost too full! After we brought it up to management's attention, we had to chase down the server for our food. I can't imagine the service on a busy night..

Overall the food is ok. nothing special. it's your typical chinese food - salty and super greasy."}
{"text":"Magic Wok has been around for years.. I mean 25 years + or more.

They have 2 locations, one in Chinatown Spadina and Dundas and one uptown (used to be in Scarborough and they built their own restaurant up at Kennedy and 14th)

The Magic Wok uptown is famous for 2 things: their nasty waitstaffs and their good Cantonese food!

Some of waitstaffs that worked 25+ years ago still working there!! I guess having nasty service can be a trademark in itself. To be fair, they are all a  lot mellower than when they were young...

Magic Wok is not opened for lunch, just for early dinner till late at night..so no lunch special...

When you walked in the restaurants you will see tanks of fresh seafood: crabs, fishes, lobsters that you can order live and make it anyway you want...They even bring the live fish to your table to show you..\" I am so sorry, I did not mean to kill you fish...but I am hungry...\"

All the dishes are well prepared and pipping hot when served... And there is free soup and free dessert (my favourite is tofu pudding that made in house)

They settle the bill by counting how many bowels of rice you order by the empty bowels on the table.. so there maybe dispenency if you by accident using one of the rice bowel as your space bowel....(that happened to us often!)

Service is fast if the kitchen is not busy... (so go when it is NOT busy...)

They has their own parking lot which is small and  it can be quite full during busy time..and you has to park across the street on the side of the road.. 

All the dishes are great .. I love everything I ordered from here.

They take Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"the essence of cantonese stir-fry is to have a high heat wok, enough amount of oil, quick stir till food's cooked, served steaming hot.  we call it \"wok hei\" in cantonese.

yeap, this place has very good food.  naturally, the line is very long too.  and it seems like it's a toronto-chinese culture to make reservations for everyday dinner.  that said, no \"reservation\" would guarantee seating at the appointed time--you're just telling them you MAY be arriving and they will TRY to get you a table as soon as possible.  can't blame the restaurants, as many patrons don't take their reservations seriously and often abuse the system (ex. reserve in multiple places, don't call to cancel in case of skipping out, etc.).  yeah, chinese courtesy in a nutshell.

that aside, food is great and totally worth returning.  the hardest part really is getting a spot for your car outside AND for yourself inside.

{"text":"I am at a loss for words. Why oh why did this magnificent place close down? From the same owners who brought you Lee Garden (downtown on Spadina), this sister restaurant was a Markham institution for 20+ years. They moved around the neighbourhood a bit before that, but this was a permanent location for quite some time.

I grew up eating here and it (truly) pains me to know I'll never be able to eat their taro nest mango chicken, lobster and vermicelli, beef and veggies and free homemade soup + dessert again. 

I will miss the red-vested staff that never seemed to age and the green interior with paint chipping in every corner. 

Where else will I get this old school Cantonese style dinner? It's been real, Magic Wok. Just know that you will never be forgotten.


P.S. if anyone knows where their chefs went, send me a message!"}
{"text":"Just came here for a party. I haven't been here for a while.

Started with deep fried oyster. But it didn't come with any sauce and was a bit bleh.  Too much berating too.  

Next came seafood birds nest. It was quite good. The nest was not too oily and the broccoli was very smooth to taste. The scallops were good too. Will order it next time. 

The next thing we got was improperly served bean curd with seafood soup. I say improperly because the way the waitress poured it the soup spoon handle had soup on it as well. This also happened to the person beside me. I think because unlike a proper server who takes out the spoons before pouring the soup, she did not.

The soup was good though. Not too salty. Rocky road texture which I like with a bit of parsley to add a bit of fragrance. 

Since they don't wear name tags the best thing I can do to describe the rude server is this. Middle age, chubby, female, glasses with short hair and streaks.

The next dish was sweet and sour pork. The meat would have been good but the sauce was a bit too tangy so I was not able to enjoy it as much. 

The next two dishes we got were crispy chicken and steamed fish. 

Though the chicken was very soft and juicy in texture the taste was just dominated by salt. Sort of a waste.

Fish was good. Nothing really special. 

Lobster which arrived soon after also nothing special, but it is still good. 

Spicy sizzling beef on a hot plate. Since it is spicy I cannot eat much of it. From what I tasted though, it wasn't really an excellent spice choice for me as I did not enjoy eating it. However I liked it crispy noodles it came with. 

The next dish I ate was the deep fried shrimp. The nice part of the dish was you can eat the shrimp whole with the skin. You can taste the shrimp. Unfortunately they did put a bit too much salt on it so it masked some of it's flavor. 

The next dish was a braised duck and veggie dish. It looked very healthy. Different kinds of mushrooms and other veggies. However, after taking a bite it was so laden with MSG I did not bother eating it anymore after one bite.

Wow talk about lousy service ordering water we just got a tray of water dumped beside me and we just distributed it ourselves. 

I tried their king oyster mushroom and snow pea sprouts. Maybe I am just in aftershock from the msg from the other dish, but I could not eat this too well. 

Their filler noodle was not too good either. Couldn't eat more than a couple of bites and it felt a bit myech in my mouth at this time. 

The myech feeling went away with the desert.  Some tapioca soup which actually neutralized most of the MSG feeling in my mouth and it wasn't too sweet so bonus points for that.

And there is no free wifi.

So because of LOUSY service, and some bad food in the mix, this only gets 3 stars.  If I had to pay and tip them it will be definitely be less than 10%."}
{"text":"Not as good as they used to be (especially when I was like 4 or 5 and they were a small, cramped restaurant), but still very decent.

Two of their signature dishes are the smoked chicken (great grandfather chicken) and red-roasted fish.  They are great.  The smoked chicken is very different from Western smoked chicken - it's not as dense, the flavour is subtler, it's slightly sweet.  It's delicious.  And it comes with marinated jellyfish, which is delicious.

The red-roasted fish is also great - it comes with a really savoury sauce that comes with spinach and whole cloves of roasted garlic.  Amazing.  I don't like that the fish has bones, because I\"m lazy (and the only fish dish with bones that I like is steamed fish) but it's still pretty good.

All the other standard Cantonese dishes are good too - ginger and green onion lobster, shrimp fried egg, all kinds of stir-fried Chinese veggie dishes, the \"birds nest\" stir fries (you know, the stuff that comes in a fried taro basket), seafood - it's all good.

Line ups aren't nearly as bad as before either, but you may want to arrive a little bit early to guarantee instant seating."}
