{"text":"We have been ordering or getting pizza from here for 10+ years. Pizza is good but the delivery service is far from decent. We got our pizza tonight and it was cold. Need to rethink ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I got the wings. They were without a doubt the WORST wings I have ever got. Small, dry, flavorless, old tasting, burnt. Soo many bad flavors come to mind. Overpriced GARBAGE! AVIOD! Listen, I can not stress enough how bad this place is. DO NOT EAT HERE. Go to one of the two pizza places with walking distance of this \"restaurant\"."}
{"text":"It was our first experience with this pizza. And we were very dissapointed! We ordered hawaian pizza with some mushrooms and olives in it. From the first look it looked ok but have to say pizza had NO flavor at all! Seemed like we were eating plain unsalted pizza dough with just little bit of cheese. Would not recommend this store to anyone and eill never go back there again."}
{"text":"Don't order the white pizza unless you want oil crust with just cheese.  Most white pizza standardly has tomatoes and basil.  Customer service is lacking and doesn't care. No apology when calling and got hung up on.  Last time ordering here."}
{"text":"Great deal. Great pizza. I picked up a large 16\" pizza and it was $15.00. You can feed a family of four for two days for that. There's really not much more to say about the pizza other than it's good quality, fast, and worth a stop."}
{"text":"Don't let the limited number of reviews on here deter you from going.  We had a white pizza and a meatball hoagie and both were exceptionally delicious.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Google reviews were good, so we ordered a taco pizza, a regular pizza with bacon and pepperoni, and an order of wings. Blah! Just mediocre at best. The wings tasted old and reheated. The taco pizza was tasty but dry and came without taco sauce. The pepperoni and bacon pizza was overdone and was a bit like rubber. And it took just under an hour to arrive. We had high hopes, but were very disappointed."}
{"text":"I am actually surprised nobody has reviewed this pizza shop as it is quite good.  This location is a smaller shop and I believe take-out/delivery only as I don't recall seeing any dining area.   The pizza is delicious (tastes like Mineo's in Pittsburgh) and is very reasonably priced. Their large pizza easily feeds a family of four. The orders are usually 15 minutes or less and the staff is generally polite and friendly when picking up. I have not used their delivery service, so I cannot comment. They do accept coupons too.  I am giving 4 instead of 5 due to a lack of appetizer options and closing earlier than the Murrysville location, but for a slice, I will go here a lot."}
{"text":"This is the closest pizza to us and unfortunately there's not much to write about. Every time I drive past staff is outside smoking or on their phones. Pizza, the few times we ordered is really just ok. Personally Johnny's wife's Place 2 has better pizza plus they have pizza night specials. I'm not sure how this location even stays open, especially now with Aiellos open (much better, although much more expensive)"}
{"text":"Wings were disgusting!!  They honestly tasted to be at least a day old. I am not picky but could not even eat these.  Pizza was sub par as well.  We like to try different places local to us.  This will not be revisited unless Donna Lynn would like to change my mind."}
