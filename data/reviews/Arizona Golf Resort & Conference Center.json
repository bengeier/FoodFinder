{"text":"The girl working at the front desk, Angie, was very helpful and polite. A guy took us to our room on the golf cart, he was also very nice.  The reason he had to take us on a golf cart is because parking by our room was not an option and we would have never found our room otherwise. That is about the end of anything nice I could say.

-The room was a good size but had a funky smell and was VERY outdated (and very depressing). I am pretty sure we had the first microwave ever invented in our room so that was a nice piece of history.
-The kitchen had no dishes_why have a kitchen at all?
-We had to ask for fresh towels every day.  One day the \"fresh towels\" were dirty
-We took cold showers every day, even after they supposedly fixed it.
-We had to call maintenance to fix the TV.  It did not work until then and they took about 1 hour to arrive.
-We wanted to order room service.  I called the restaurant and nobody answered.  So I called the front desk and explained I couldn't get them on the phone and that there was also no menu in the room. They said they would send a menu over to our room.  After an hour of waiting we finally left to get food somewhere else.
-1 pool was closed and the other was not so great.  The water seemed murky and there were only 3 lounge chairs that weren't broken.
-The fitness center was super outdated and depressing...If you could actually find it you would see. We asked a worker where the gym was and he claimed to not know.  We walked away with a perplexed look only to hear him yell \"oh did you mean the fitness center?\". Sorry I wasn't more specific. 
-Finding anything on this property is a joke.  We had family visit and not one person could find our casita.  We ordered pizza and the driver gave up. We had trouble finding the pool and the gym.  When we went to the front desk for a map we stood there and waited 10 minutes for the employee to answer call after call before greeting us.  We JUST needed a map. Aren't you supposed to greet the people in front of you first? Maybe put the maps out for people to help themselves??

I would never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Stayed in a casita in the 600 area which was very fine. Comfortable bed, nice facilities including sink and fridge. Very quiet and the curtains did a fine job of keeping out sunlight. Didn't watch TV but the wi-fi was spotty. Shower pressure was not great but serviceable. Outside our cluster of rooms were weber grills and a jacuzzi. Staff was most attentive and courteous and arrived promptly when I requested a lift to the registration area or other functions around the large restort. Location is fantastic for the event I attended -- the premiere gathering of BONANZA fans at Lorne Greene's Ponderosa Ranch -- the actor's former home built to be an exact duplicate of the famed ranch house set. It was a short walk across the outer rim of the driving range to the back of the \"Cartwright\" ranch house (but if you walk across the green rather than get a complimentary ride from the resort to the Greene house, do watch out when the old duffers are practicing their drives . . )"}
{"text":"Luncheon & meeting at AZ Golf Resort today. The meal was the best -- better than many at name properties in Phoenix & elsewhere in the US (we attend a lot of these events!). The staff was stupendous -- very cordial and efficient chauffeuring  customers from the parking lot to conference center. Wait staff was equally professional. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Needed to meet some people for a one day business meeting.  Hospitality through the roof!  Also booked rooms for a couple nights.  It's an older place but more than served it's purpose, coming from a person that travels and has seen both the best and worst of what hotels offer.

Unanimous decision by the group that this will be our \"Phoenix\" place to meet in the future!"}
{"text":"Nice facility, horrible service. Clean rooms, a little dated. Great main pool! I went in mid October and this place was practically vacant. The spa & restaurant were closed which was not disclosed on the website. Front desk staff were completely unhelpful, mostly one named Cara was outwardly put off by questions like 'is the restaurant open' *answers with huffs* no. Unless you are going for golf, choose a different 'resort'. However, it would be a great place to book a wedding or family reunion in October because there is no one staying there!"}
{"text":"I have played this golf course a few times over the past few years and the place just keeps getting better. The course is in good shape, nice people, great price and conveniently located. 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"We are checking out tomorrow morning after a three day stay here at the Arizona Golf Resort. 

Pros: We got a really nice room (400's). The bed is super comfortable, nice chairs and a table, lots of lighting, nice television set along with a fridge, microwave and sink. The bathroom is very spacious with a huge bathtub! Nice marble countertops and there's an iron and ironing board in the room as well. Very nice accommodations. The d√©cor is a bit outdated but so what? I'm not staying here to stare at the walls or the bedspread; I came to visit family. All we did was slept and showered in our room. 

Another HUGE pro is that they allow pets. Seeing as though we have two, this was a big selling point for us to stay here. 

The ground are beautiful and well-maintained. The staff is very friendly and helpful. 

Cons: When I first made our reservation, I specifically asked about pets and pet fees. I was told that yes, they allow pets and no, there are no pet fees. Great! Not so fast....on the television, there's a channel that allows you to see your room bill. Turns out we got charged $25 PER PET for a total of $50. Not cool..if you want to charge a pet fee, you MUST tell people up front; not just tack it to their bill and expect them to pay it. Somewhat shady. 

*BE CAREFUL ABOUT THIS* This resort charges for LOCAL CALLS. They are NOT FREE! This is something that we did not know until we saw our call charges on the room bill. Luckily, someone removed these charges for us. We never made one long distance call; only a few local calls and got charged out the behind. Nobody will tell you that local calls must be paid for so do yourself a favor and don't use the phone in your room because it will cost you an arm and a leg. 

EDIT* Just found out we got screwed on the bill. When I initially made the reservations, I was told the room would be $79 per night with no pet fee. They charged us $100 per night on top of $50 for the dogs. I am going to file a complaint with the BBB.

VERY dishonest resort. Save your money and go elsewhere; the hassle here isn't worth it. 

Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I was notified less than 1 hour of check in that the Hotel was over booked. The staff blamed Orbitz and told me they were notified 2 Weeks prior. I pressed the manager at the front desk how they could cancel a reservation for 4 rooms that was placed back in September 2016. There was no response. The moment I mentioned that I had contacted my attorney they admitted that they only notified Orbitz less than 2 hours before check in and began scrambling to get us rooms. They found 3 rooms and crammed 8 adults into them.  The Hotel itself is filthy. I informed the staff daily that there were bird droppings all over the patio leading up to the pool. No one took the time to hose it down."}
{"text":"I attended a Family Reunion here September 2015 snd fell in love with the resort. We stayed in a Casita which we really enjoyed as it has a kitchenette.  Even though the room needed a little updating,  it was clean which is more important to me. 
The customer service was great. I love that there is a bar and restaurant on the grounds so we didn't have to drive anywhere.  Friday night karaoke is a hoot!  

I enjoyed the resort so much that  I booked a Company Event at the Conferece Center which was held this past week. I am very happy with the whole process, from the front desk to the Event Planner and their New General Manager is a joy to  work with! 

I am pleased the resort is under New Management and and that the entire resort is undergoing renovation so I know I will be back! 

In fact, I already booked my next Company Event here for September!"}
{"text":"We thought this ''resort'' was decent until we received a $250 smoking fee charged 3 days later. We spoke to the general manager Gina, about this issue because there was absolutely no smoking in the room throughout our stay. She was very unprofessional to say the least! After claiming that she had picture evidence of this action and saying several times that she would send them to us, she has not. We were able to speak with her once and then she ignored the rest of our calls after until we informed her staff that we would be getting a lawyer if this issue wasn't resolved. It's clear this hotel thinks it's okay to scam their customers!"}
{"text":"poor, I really tried to search for 1 positive about my stay, the only thing I could think of was leaving the parking lot after checking out. definitely not a four star, it would be a stretch to give them a 1 star. from the moment of checking in nothing was as their website stated. front desk staff was rude, booked a king was given two fulls, room had a kitchen but no pots or pans, pool was green, room was old and beat up, paint chipped, could see multiple drywall attempted repairs, holes still in the walls, microwave was old hardly worked, doors were old with big gaps, had to set thermostat to 77 and was either hot or cold from the outside air coming through, had to use 2 different remotes for the TV, 1 to change channels and 1 for volume, called the front desk to let them know about the bed situation and was told they had no kings left. saw on the website that the king Casita which I booked the day before was now 50.00 cheaper and had 4 left. but I had just been told 20 minutes earlier that they didn't have any. parking is rediculous and the buildings are poorly marked and the blurry map they gave us was unreadable. received an email from the manager stating to call her right away (gina) to discuss the rating I had left the hotel, called and was told she wasn't on property. transferred to her voice mail left a message and of 3pm the next day still have not heard from anyone. spoke to 3 other guests and none were happy with their stay, upon checkout more rude desk help."}
{"text":"Place smells dusty & moldy, 70's decor. Got what we paid for.Paid for two nights but spent the 1st night throwing up due to the smell. They would not refund, checked out & spent the rest of my weekend at the residence hotel. I was very disappointed, i would not associate the name resort with this place."}
{"text":"If I could give less stars than this I would.  Let's start with my experience within the first five minutes stepping onto the premises:
Picture yourself after a long day of travel.  You are finally reunited with your whole family whom you haven't seen in almost a year. You and your whole family are excited to spend the rest of the evening together catching up and building memories....until the front desk tells you they OVERBOOKED and they are relocating just three of us to a completely different hotel. We have had reservations for months and they tell us THE DAY OF that they don't have a room for us?! The most atrocious hotel service I have ever heard of in my entire life. They claimed that they call us, then tell us that they don't have a phone number on file.  They relocate us to a hotel a small step above a motel 6. The employees told us we weren't the only ones experiencing this tonight. 

So if you enjoy staying in a musty, lackluster \"resort\" that has no concern at all for their customers, this is the place for you.  This is a story that will go down in the books as the most atrocious customer service I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"I can't speak for how this place is for golfing, but as a \"resort\" and conference center, it's terrible. If you care about your event or your guests at all, avoid this place at all costs. A friend of mine held her multi-day wedding here. First of all, even if things had gone smoothly, the hotel rooms are too far from the meeting rooms to be practical. The layout is extremely convoluted and none of the ballrooms are even labeled. The guests had to get around by car, which defeats the purpose of staying on site. Second and more importantly, the staff does not seem the least bit concerned about professionalism. As a bridesmaid, the bride arranged for me to book my room weeks (months even?) earlier than everyone else - supposedly in the 700 building, which is close to the meeting halls. When the day of the event came, we found that the resort had overbooked guests. Rather than denying further reservations, the staff randomly rearranged rooms and cancelled some reservations entirely without bothering to inform the affected guests. I was placed in the 600 building on the opposite side of the resort while it is still undergoing some sort of construction, which was not only uncomfortable to stay in but made it close to impossible to perform my bridesmaid duties since it is a 10 min walk away. I was lucky though. Some guests arrived only to discover that they had no rooms at all. Then they conveniently forgot about the discounted room rate agreed upon for the wedding guests and overcharged me $20 a night. Another member of the wedding party repeatedly had her key card deactivated for no apparent reason. On one occasion she was stuck outside her room the middle of the night in a formal evening gown for half an hour before someone bothered to come help her. As for the room itself? Meh. Somewhat better than a roadside motel but not a \"resort\" by far. My room also had no light outside it, so struggling to find my keycard after walking through a long, dark alley in evening wear in fear of being mugged was not an ideal way to end each evening. Please do not give this establishment your hard earned money. They don't deserve it."}
{"text":"Everything about our Jan 23, 2015 wedding at the Arizona Golf Resort was exactly as we planned and hoped.  We had the first of our guests arrive the Saturday before our Friday wedding.  The attentiveness and extreme friendliness of the staff, whether in regards to the satisfaction of the rooms and suites, the restaurant, the golfing and the shuttle driver awed both ourselves and our family & friends.  

The day of the wedding a large group of us golfed in the morning and then we had a beautiful 5:30pm ceremony on the \"Lawn\" area followed by cocktail hour in the beautiful Tuscan Courtyard and hall area inside the banquet hall. The amazing reception was held in the Fairways Banquet room, which was beautiful! The food, service and decor were impeccable.  The following day we had another great lunch held outside the lounge area near the pool.

Thank You All so very much; Jan, Yolanda, Carolyn, Denecia, Yesenia, Chef and all your amazing staff (you were all incredible), all the Pro Shop staff and Patrick.
 
Regarding other reviews that talk about the AZ Resort being dated - yes, it is...in some areas, though you can see the upgrades that are continuously happening to bring the resort back to 100%.  The resort however is very clean and the maintenance staff are there extremely fast to fix any issues that may come about.  

The Old World Charm of The Arizona Golf Resort really needs to be seen in person to be appreciated.  It has class and elegance, which was exactly what we wanted for our wedding. Highly recommend for the venue itself and the most amazing staff you will ever encounter!

Thank you Arizona Resort from Sandra and David"}
{"text":"The course is in horrible shape, as hot as the weather is I would expect a \"resort\" to have a beverage cart out on the course. Especially on a weekend. The bar was out dated and the food mediocre at best and they did not have a great selection of beers.  I would not recommend this even for the cheap price!"}
{"text":"I really love the open fairways on this course. Makes it easier and more relaxing for a golfer like me to learn and improve. Always have a great time. The staff is always friendly and helpfull. The food is pretty awesome as well."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!!!

Coming in for the birth of our grandchild, we were on a budget.  We
Originally booked elsewhere first assuming a golf resort would be out of our budget.  

Our stay at our intended hotel lasted about 5 minutes due to disgusting room and rude staff. As we drove to meet friends for dinner we passed the resort and decided to check rates. To our astonishment the resort was less per night than the scuzzy dirty motel down the road.

The staff was AMAZING!!!!  From the front desk to security to wait staff I can't believe how helpful, kind and just pleasant every single staff member we met was!!

The rooms, while in need of updating, we're spotless!  We had a suite in the back with a front door facing a courtyard and a back door to a patio on the greens. The beds were comfy, the front room was complete with a very well appointed kitchen area and even had a stove top.

If you are expecting a Ritz or The Wyndham you will be disappointed. It is outdated and not stuffy or pretentious like those types of resorts  It is not a luxury resort. It is a clean, comfortable, working mans resort with a warm and comfy staff and stunningly affordable rates. 

We will stay here again and recommend it highly."}
{"text":"I have always found the people who work for Arizona Golf Resort from the pro shop, to the cart guys and the marshals to be very friendly and helpful.  The course is a nice \"walk in the park,\" with plenty of shade when the days are warm.  The price for a round is very reasonable too!"}
{"text":"I have never been more disgusted in my life by an establishment I ordered 2 different things and they were out of both.  The server was  really sweet and apologetic said  they are going through some changes no big deal but then I over heard the employees talking about a roach crawling out of a guests salad and she couldn't understand why the owner wouldn't just stop being so greedy and just close the kitchen and get it clean.  I have heard from other people that this is an ongoing problem and after looking up their health inspections I will never come here again!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an unkept, worn out, tired motel 6 experience this place is for you!
Not like the website, at all."}
{"text":"First off, the pictures posted here are completely misleading. This place has potential, but it would take a monumental infusion of money. Everything besides the pool furniture here looked decades old.
The rooms: The doors to the rooms are wood. The fact that they are very old means that they've drastically warped and don't close tightly. We were in several rooms between ours being moved and visiting other guests of the event we were at, all of them had issues with the doors closing tightly. The rooms themselves were furnished with what seemed like other name-brand hotels' former furniture. Again, each room we went in had different decor, chairs, etc. It appeared that they just picked up hotel liquidation furniture from a Marriott and now call it their own. The rooms were sort of clean, but the tile and carpeting were so old that it would be impossible to get the mildew and funk off the tile in the bathroom with simple cleaners, or the stains out of the carpet with a cleaning. The beds were fine, but the tv in our first room didn't work. We ended up changing rooms twice on the first day since the first room we were put in was a single when we'd requested a double, and the second room had a door that didn't even close all the way. We could literally see outside the room from inside with the door shut since it was so warped from the frame. 
The \"fitness center\" was the worst I've ever seen at a hotel. It consisted of two treadmills, one of which didn't work, no free weights, and most importantly NO AIR CONDITIONING! It's Arizona, how can you work out without A/C? There were a few ceiling fans, but that was it. Also, the TV in the gym didn't work either and there were no towels anywhere to use. It was terrible and I didn't go back during our stay. 
The grass was dead everywhere since they mow it too short and scalp it. The pool had cracked tiles in numerous places. The dial for the hot tub jets was definitely not something that is up to any electrical code. It was literally put in a double switch junction box, occupying only one side, and leaving wiring exposed on the other open side. Probably not the smartest idea when it's going to be touched by wet people in the pool area! This is a perfect example of the lack of caring about the resort. This is a fix that would require all of $10-$20 in parts and 30 minutes of a maintenance person's time, but it appeared it had been that way for a long time.    
The bill: The resort sent a confirmation email with the itemized bill to review prior to arriving. However, once we arrived, the total suddenly was $50 more. When I asked, they explained that this was a \"resort fee\". I stated that I'd received an itemized cost breakdown and it included tax, but mentioned nothing of a \"resort fee\". They said it's not on the emailed bill breakdown, but it is required. I have no idea what this \"fee\" was for, considering things like the gym were essentially unusable during our stay, but they knew I didn't have a choice at this point to argue it. It's basically just a gimmick to get more money out of you since they've already charged your card by the time you find out about it. 
The staff was friendly and seemed like they had little to offer in terms of correcting issues. 
In short, this seems like a resort that may have been nice in it's prime (30 years ago), but needs to be torn down and built over again. The rooms are awful and not worth the cost. We would have immediately left after seeing the second and third rooms we were transferred to, since they were all the same. The more modern choice hotels and others in the area were less expensive per night and offered much more in return, most of which was a cleaner and more modern facility. We were with a large wedding group, all staying at the resort, and most all of them said the same about their experience. Some of them paid for \"Suites\", which cost much more, we visited while we were there, and they were larger versions of the room we had with the same issues.  
In short, this resort could be made to be a great one. It will just take completely new management and a lot of money to turn it around. I would never stay here again in it's current condition and would recommend anyone consiering it to stay away and try one of the many other options within 20 mins drive on Rt. 60 in and around the Phoenix area. You can get a nice new clean room elsewhere for less money.

With regard to the Bill: Here is the breakdown of the itemized costs:

\"Rate Information

Rate Currency: $ 
Room Rate: 109.00 per night.
Rate description: 
Plus tax when applicable
First Night Rate With Tax: 124.28

That is copied exactly from my confirmation email. Notice there is no mention at all about a \"Resort Fee\"."}
{"text":"Just checked into this hotel for my annual spring training/spring break with my 12 yr old son. Check in took quite a long time but I did check in at 10pm with one person working the counter. She was very pleasant. The outside of the room or villa is nice but keep in mind my review is during the night. I did however find a dirty fridge grill on one of the hedges next to door. NICE! Inside the room, the carpet is noticeable dirty. God knows what interesting microbes are inside this carpet. I Will not walk around in my bear feet or white socks. Very outdated cabinets and bathroom fixtures. The mini fridge is on it's last leg with the front wood paneling attached with sheet metal screws. The shower exhaust vent sounds like a 20 yr old blender and when turned off it burps! Scared my son. There is a strong wifi signal but I will try that out further tomorrow. Room rate is $149/night which is good during this time of the year but I'm concluding I'm getting what I'm paying for. Stay tuned for day two of my four day stay!"}
{"text":"$130 is way overpriced for the lack of accommodations that they provide i.e. continental breakfast was intended to be free not added at an additional charge or \"only with package deals\" the room was #OLD the coffee napkin \"broke\" there were spiderwebs in all the lamp shades and I ended up with a spider my wife had to kill on me.... the list goes on with cold hot tubs and bad wifi, but despite all of the problems with the product we were truly offended by the GM, Jon Eid, My wife and I were waiting for our ride out front after checking out a little early listening to some music when he came up to us and instantly insisted to know if we were guests and why we were there we told him we were guests and were just waiting for our ride. He then threatened to call the police if we did not leave the property by the time he counted to 20...I feel labeled and as though i was completely put out for no reason but still we left with no resistance just disappointment."}
{"text":"Today my disabled child was not only physically injured but emotionally traumatized by the cook Eddie. Apparently Eddie came to our unit but I'm still trying to figure out why a cook would have a master key to tenant apartments. He attempted to illegally enter/burglarize our unit for the new General Manager/Controllers orders I assume as how else would he have a key to our home. 

Our child has had 38 surgeries, 23 hospitalizations recently. Life saving equipment in the unit and everyone at Arizona Golf Resort is aware for him to try to break in and she had to lock the bolt because she at the time had no idea who was trying to get in. My son took a picture so we knew who it was. 

Do not ever stay here. They have been featured on dirty dining, these units are full of roaches, there are housing code violations in our case electricity that we need for our child's ventilator and oxygen. 

To call this place a resort is a joke. It's a slumlord place with a golf course. This property isn't even coded by housing to rent apartments in addition to the other numerous other code violations.

To treat a disabled child in this manner is absolutely unacceptable and Joanne and Eddie both need to be fired for this but no worries. OSHA, Housing and Code Violations, Disability Advocates, an attorney representing my disabled child in addition to media coverage will be made because of the poor and illegal actions of Eddie the cook by orders of Joanne. 

Run run run from Arizona Golf Resort. If they can do this to a child with such serious illnesses just think how they will treat you, your guests and family members.

Update: They illegally locked us out of our home knowing we have a child with serious medical issues with life saving equipment at home. Just know who your doing business with."}
{"text":"What a dirty outdated property. We arrived to check in at 6:30pm and were told our room had not been cleaned yet.  We went to eat dinner and when we came back told us would be another 20 minutes before room was ready.  Once we got into our room smelled musty and dirty.  We tried to turn on the air conditioner to help get rid of smell but found air not working.  Needless to say did not sleep much because of stuffy smelly room.  Will never go back here or recommend to anyone I know.  One of worst places I have ever stayed out.  Very dissappointed."}
{"text":"They mixed up our rooms reservations for our family reunion of 60+ people. They didn't give us the chairs we requested in advance from flying all over the country and landing here this is not the best best any means. Sup service for sure."}
{"text":"We love coming here! Not only do we come for dinner, drinks, and events like dueling pianos, karaoke, and holidays, they also host our schools performing arts banquets.  

The service is really good.
They have fun drink specials with unique drinks on the menu.
They have a beautiful pool area
They food is good( I love the taco salad) only once was the food not great, because of a large event going on, but they were so nice and comp'd the meal.

They truely know customer service. Katie is typically our server but we have been helped by others and have never walked out of their with less than a smile on my face (and trust me I am picky when it comes to customer service)  They are always trying to find fun events to have. I always look forward to a new event. I have yet to stay in the actual resort, but looking forward to it this summer. 

I highly recommend checking them out!"}
{"text":"When I was at the front desk asking for them to reactivate my key because they had changed the code before checkout time while we were at breakfast,  the person ahead of me complained about no toilet paper or towels. I had the same complaint. The maid came in and left without replacing the almost empty roll of toilet paper.  The room was rundown and outdated. Wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience ever, Room was completely filthy, hotel staff was not helpful.   They put us way out in building number 8 room 608 real close to the hot tub at which time they told us we might see homeless bathing. \" wait what\"  yes you heard that right, they told us we might see homless bathing in the hot tub.  Only bright spot was the hotel bartender, she had her stuff together.   I even took pictures of how nasty the room was to show the front desk ( she looked shocked)  i was  told i would be receiving  my money back and 1 week later still nothing."}
{"text":"This hotel is a joke. We booked on Priceline but upon arrival they made us use a credit card again and double charged us. The desk clerk Tiana who works at night didn't know the charges or breakdown saying all deposits were refundable but the pet deposit was not. She claimed she was just an auditor to get out of knowing what she was talking about. At checkout we had to call Priceline to get them to confirm it was already paid. This place is old and run down I would never stay here again."}
{"text":"I live in the area and this is my favorite bar and restaurant to stop by after a long day of work. The bartenders are always nice and always have a beer ready for me. They have a great happy hour with great food and drink specials. I always go in on fridays for their all you can eat fish n chips, really good fish at a great price. I often have friends and family stay at the resort since it's so close to home. The rooms and spacious and the resort staff is always super accommodating and friendly. Stop by and check out this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Wow,  all I can say is yuck.  The hotel grounds stank like sulfur and Raw sewage.   The rooms were run down, patched walls  and broken down mattress, and had to wrestle with the faucet to get a shower.    The website is so deceiving,  states \"remodeled \" rooms. There were elements that appeared new but the carpets and furniture were not. The only pluses of the stay have  to be the generous size of the room and the mediocre free breakfast."}
{"text":"I would give this place negative stars if I could. We planned a trip for a softball tournament to Arizona and found this room online. We called and booked a suite big  enough for 6 people. The guy who booked the room said it didn't matter how many people we had in the room it only mattered for breakfast and since we were not having breakfast two ppl was all we needed to list. I provided him with my card number to reserve and he said they would not charge anything until midnight the night we were staying if we did not show. This was a month and a half ago. Our trip was this weekend and after driving 6 hours we show up to the Hotel only for the manager Tammy to tell me she is sorry but they tried to run the card on file and it was invalid so they gave the room away! I told her it was impossible and she tried to act like she was embarrassing me by saying my card declined, which when I confirmed the last 4 was not even my bank card I had provided. What it came down to is every place in the area was booked for several events and she up sold our room leaving us stranded without a place to sleep! It took two hours to find a room but we went through Marriott which was a much better hotel. This could have been considered one incident but we had other people that were staying at Arizona golf resort as well and Tammy gave away the double they reserved trying to put 3 adults in one king bed! We have attempted to contact corporate through email and on Facebook. They deleted our Facebook post. Do not ever book here if you get into town late and they are over sold you might be stuck without a place to stay. I was very disappointed and if the manager Tammy is any indication of how the hotel runs its a nightmare. She had the worst customer service skills I have ever seen!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this resort. We booked a room with a kitchen for the sole purpose of the refrigerator. We did not discover till the morning that it was not working and as a result of I lost all my breast milk. When we went to check out and told the frony desk all they said was we will have maintenance take a look. Never again will we stay there."}
{"text":"Arrived on Thursday 3/19 for baseball tournament and spring training games, told our rooms had been given away since the prior guest wanted to extend there stay(we booked suites months in advance) quoting the desk clerk \"we dont ask guest to leave\" although this could have turned out very bad the manager stepped in and took care of the matter,we did not get our suites but to our satisfaction we were given other rooms and compensated for our troubles. Rooms kept clean, food okay, pool area kept clean and room service was good"}
{"text":"I have golfed here for years, I have always had a great experience. Great staff ( Katy ), great course, great food!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst places ever. The rooms smell moldy. The customer service is the worst. The tile, roofs, pool and resort are falling apart. Rust around the shower and toliet smells like sewer.  If you see this on Groupon DO NOT BUY IT.  The pictures are false!!"}
{"text":"This place has potential, unfortunately it fell a bit short from that. To start our check in took forever. Our room was not too bad except for the hazards (see pictures) we also didn't have towels in our room so I was really glad I had packed my beach towels. We tried calling housekeeping for towels but there was no answer. The following day my husband asked the lady cleaning the rooms and she advised us we had to wait until our room was cleaned to get towels. Quite an inconvenience. Another annoyance was the fact that there seemed to be some painting in the area where our room was located, one day we awoke to our patio being blocked off by plastic due to them painting. I wouldnt have minded so much if they would have told us the moment we checked in and also didn't charge us a $20 remodel fee per night, which may I add im still waiting on a call back on an answer as to what that fee is for. If you ask me it should be a credit, not a charge. Our room located in the 600s came with a kitchenette equipped with an outdated stovetop, a few utensils, one small pot a mini fridge and a coffee maker; no coffee pot included. Overall our stay was ok. Pros: The resort grounds, and pool area are very nice. The beds were comfy. Like I said place has potential."}
{"text":"Firstly, let me say I found the staff friendly, attentive and helpful. We arrived around 10:45pm to check in, after a long day of traveling, and were greeted by Heather, who was delightful and charming. She went out of her way to make sure we knew how to get around the hotel, explained about our free breakfast, answered our questions and accommodated our requests. What a pleasant surprise to be greeted by someone who actually seemed to enjoy her job and took pride in the hotel. 

We liked our room. It was big, clean and looked like it was recently renovated. Wi-fi worked well. We enjoyed sitting on the patio overlooking the golf course in the morning. The bed was decent. The reason I am knocking off a star is due to two things: 

1) The bed was made with a sheet, a super thin blanket, and topped with another sheet. There was no duvet or comforter, nor were there any extra blankets or pillows in the closet. It was late and we didn't want to wait for room service to bring us more, so we went to bed. The problem is, my husband runs much hotter than I do, so I was freezing all night. Typically my husband will remove the comforter from his side and I'll use it doubled up, or I'll grab an extra blanket. We did request an extra blanket and pillow the next day, and they were waiting in our room when we returned. Much better!

2) One of the reasons I booked a room at Arizona Golf Resort is because they come with a mini-kitchen, including 2 burners, so one can cook food, not just microwave it. I eat very healthy, and pack much of my own food when traveling. The next morning when I went to cook, I did not find a single pot or pan in the kitchen. There were utensils and plates, bowls, etc, but what's the point of having burners if one can't use them? My husband took advantage of the free breakfast (restaurant staff was also wonderful!) and I went to reception to request a single pan and large stirring spoon to bring back to the room. Again, the staff was friendly and accommodated my request for the pan (no big spoons available apparently), but I thought it was odd when the receptionist explained that \"if I wanted to use the kitchen I would have had to request cookware.\" Hmmm - that seemed strange, since nothing on my reservation mentioned needing to request cookware, and the photos on their website of the kitchenette were a big part of what sold me on the hotel. Not a deal breaker, but a little annoying. When we returned that night, we found they had left a griddle (I guess for pancakes?) and some big mixing bowls and a sponge - which was helpful since I had been using a face clothe to wash my dishes. I appreciated the fact they took the effort to bring me some more items, although it seems they maybe don't have enough to accommodate all the rooms? 

Otherwise, it was lovely property & experience. Although I agree with other reviews that it is in need of a major facelift. With a little love (money!), the resort could be spectacular, but for what we paid, we thought it was a good value and would return."}
{"text":"We golfed here recently with a group of 24.  Course was in good shape and we finished in a timely manner.  Daniel was super friendly and although she had quite a few people paying, she was very professional and friendly.  Lacy the beverage girl is always friendly as well and makes her rounds on the course frequently. She will even stock more than enough of your favorite drink if you let her know."}
{"text":"***update***
This new room is located right on the golf course, love it...security helped in my room switch, nicley tipped him for his efforts...AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL property cannot stress that enough...make sure you get a casita double or higher!!! being from san diego not a lot beats it as the bar is set high...will become one of my vacation spots!!! A handful of rabbits frockling around the property adds to the charm...up scale pool and surrounding area with wicker outdoor couches...housekeeping on point...as this is a resort a lit of your amenities are on site you dont really have to venture away from here...some guests have small pets...love to see them out walikng the little guys in the morning WITH their poop bags for a tidy property...would have gave a 5 star review but unfortunately my check in experience was not up to par, punn intended lol, so far thats the only thing I would reconsider about staying BUT the wrong was made right with my diligence, and to be fair the front desk woman may have had a bad day/week/month/year/several years remember we never know what a person is dealing with so be kind everyone:)"}
{"text":"Friendly enough staff. However it's was a 5.5 hour round of golf. Starter acted tough to everyone getting on but never enforced a reasonable pace with one group holding everything up. Then a sign to call in your food order. We called it hot dogs at the turn. Easy enough right? Wrong. Order never got in, and the food wasn't as advertised. Plain hot dog no fixings at all. They wouldn't even comp is a beer. Yikes draw far away from golf here."}
{"text":"Let's see where do we begin. We were in Phx for a wedding there were about. 20 of us w/ several rooms. We arrived checked in @ 12:30 am after arriving from The airport. We went to our casita I'm a lovely little quiet alcove(this is the 1 star) our electronic key didn't work. After several try's we call for maintenance . He arrived and was also unable to open the door. He went got another key which also didn't work . He let us in then w/ his key & went to get another! @ 1am came back still didn't work . Then we discovered the toilet didn't flush ! Let th know I the morning & they said they had to snake it 3 times! All friends at the other end also had plumbing problems - toilet, no hot water. One arrived in his room w/ 2 TVs in boxes that they had to connect! Others phones weren't connected@ all!  But the crux was- get this ... RATS IN THE RAFTERS OF THE BRIDAL SUITE! the bride and groom had to leave early!!!!!   DONT STAY HERE! It's a has been! Most people golfing were on their 80s!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. What a depressing place. Rooms are so gross. Completely dated and run down. Website is very deceiving. Motel 6 has better options but for a third of the price. I'm trying to opt out of this deal right now. I'm hopeful to move hotels entirely."}
{"text":"Make no mistake, this is an older property and not too much updating has been completed.  However, it does not take away from the nice people working there and the charm of the grounds.  

The rooms were spacious and had lots of common amenities.  The biggest disappointment was their Wi-Fi.  It did not work-no matter where you were on the property.  It should be no surprise to the hotel, as it is complained about on almost every travel site by their visitors and in person from guests. 

The golf course is always busy, and the golfers can take up a big portion of the parking lot.  However, there is plenty of parking...but might not be convenient to a room.

If you are a smoker, there are no ashtrays anywhere...however, you can ask for one from housekeeping for a room...and then search for a trashcan if you are around their campus.

I'd be back any time.  It was a pleasant stay."}
{"text":"Don't book a wedding here if you have Jennifer.! It was by far the worst wedding planner ever. First it took forever to get are food cost. Than she over charged us double had to tell her and get it fix. Everything with this lady was hassle! Come to the wedding day they didn't clean the pond. Had leafs everywhere! She only put out 43 chairs and needed 60. Only put out one table for our sand ceremony. No table for the DJ. This is everything we had to tell her to get done.!!' She just didn't do it.
When my wife got there to get dressed she told them the door is open and just head down.! Whelp guess what the door wasn't open and had to wait. Finally a maid was cleaning a room close and opened the door for them.!!! On top of that they booked someone for that room!!! Another guest came knocking on the door and wanted  their room! Hmmm ya problem here!! 
The trellis that you get married under. We got with Jennifer and said we are bring our own but can they put it in? Said yes.! Just a few hours before they said they wouldn't do it. So my father in law had to go down there ( lucky not dressed yet ) and put it in. Now looks like he just took a shower in sweat ! Thanks. When it came down to walking down she asked me if I was ready said yes! She says I'll go see if the girls are ready and I'll be RIGHT BACK! Nope she Foxing disappeared. Like really!! So we just had to run are own wedding. Luckily the DJ was on top of everything! We take are pictures (awesome camera guy btw). She wasn't even there for us entering the ballroom. Once again Dj amazing! So we get our food first and wouldn't ya know! She messed up the food order. BBQ chicken Nope how about just some seasoned chicken. Kids menu that we asked for?! How about no kids menu.! Had to quickly get food out for the kids. Over all she was a hot mess! Too bad I already paid a day before because I would have fought for the price! Oh Thanks for Foxing up are once and a life time moment !

So did this review well heres an update on a review!

Another thing I forgot to add was the grass wasn't green like we asked 3-4 times making sure it'll be green for our wedding it was not. 

Jennifer called and left a message wondering if there was anything she could do. Texted her and said we are open to talk on the phone. Than never got anything back. So if you are so worried about are opinion why didn't you make the effort?! Apparently we don't matter and it was just another day to you. I was looking forward to having closure on this day. 

One thing the ballroom was pretty and was very nice!"}
{"text":"As an individual who travels a lot for business, I've stayed in ghetto motels and 5 star resorts, this is probably the most underwhelming hotel stay I have ever experienced. 

My business team and I checked in on Saturday April 14th, and planned on staying until Friday the 20th.

The morning after we checked in I leaned against the wall and it caved in, now by no means am I that large of a guy and I've certainly leaned on quite a few walls and none have ever caved in on me. When we peered into the hole in the wall that I had just created, we were repulsed by the discovery of black mold layered so thick you could build a bomb shelter. After notifying the front desk, the maintenance guy was sent to \"inspect\". 

\"That's just the drywall paper\" he replied. 

Now, I'm not sure if any of you have seen the back of a sheet of drywall, but it isn't black and spattered with growth patterns. The maintenance guy clearly knew that  there was a black mold issue, because he said something about \"we just repaired the wall\". 

After a short walk to the lobby to see if we could at least upgrade because their rooms are clearly outdated and poorly maintained, the front desk assistant offered to reach the resort manager. To no avail she did not answer and we had to wait two hours for her to call back. 

Not only did we not get an upgrade, it took 45 minutes of haggling to get a reluctant refund.

My condolences to those affected by Priceline's 4-star ratings. I would have rather stayed in the Motel 6's worst room."}
{"text":"Nice casita that can sleep 6 for $99, plus free breakfast. What a deal. Service was excellent but the catered food was TERRIBLE!"}
{"text":"We were waited on immediately by our very friendly waitress.  Quiet atmosphere so far -Tonight is Trivial.  
Pizza's are pretty good with a beam cocktail on the side.
Beautiful rainbow over the golf course this evening"}
{"text":"We stayed there for four nights for a wedding that was held there. We got upgraded to a suite (Included a mini kitchen, refrig, and living room area) since we were part of the wedding group. 

Rate: Awesome price $99 a night

Pros: Good buffet breakfast, fair variety. The servers were ok, even though this one particular waitress would help other tables/people first AFTER I had already asked her for her assistants. The room was very roomy. A/C worked GREAT, especially it being hot that weekend. Very convenient to stores and restaurants. Buildings are old, need to renovate. No bugs/roaches in our room. 

Cons: Check in was listed at 4pm (as they claimed), we arrived at 230pm (which that's what I thought it said check in was online). We had to wait two hours before getting into our room. They didn't have enough house keepers to clean rooms. Didn't offer any golf time/tee time packages with our stay. There was only one pool that seemed to be open, our room was too far. Rooms are outside instead of enclosed within the resort. Towels provided were on the dirty side, they didn't seem washed well enough."}
{"text":"I have family in Mesa and always stay at the AZ Golf Resort.  I continue to come back year after year, never any issues... until this trip.  

First off, I forgot my toothbrush. The lady at the front desk said she didn't have one to give me and directed me to the CVS about a mile down the road... the next day I realized it would have been a lot easier if she would have pointed me to the Osco directly across the street that I could walk to rather than driving.

The hotel rooms have always been great, large rooms, well maintained, and very clean.  However, this time around our room was dirty, the bathroom especially was long overdue for a good cleaning.  Stuff all over the walls it was just gross.  The first night in our room was okay except for some drunks trying to get into our room in the middle of the night.  The first morning I got up and noticed a huge nasty cockroach on the floor.  I put a glass over it to trap it and then I left to get breakfast, when I came back to the room, housecleaning had made up the beds, but they left my pet roach under the glass near the center of the room.

That afternoon we found three roaches, I went to the front desk and reported our issues.  The gentlemen at the counter was really nice and put notes into the computer and said he would send housecleaning and he would get in touch with the manager.... housekeeping never came.  

On our second night there, I went to the front desk and asked for another blanket.  I got the run around and housekeeping finally came and said they were out of blankets.  Then the lady behind the desk made a few phone calls to locate a blanket she sent it to our room.  Seemed liked an easy request but it wasn't, just a lot of run an availability of an additional blanket???

Finally our stay was over and I went to check out this morning.  I told them about the roaches again.  We found them everywhere including our beds.  I asked if they could give us some sort of discount off our 441.27  bill.  The lady said no, we had already received the best rate possible for a suite at $129/ night.  I asked to speak with the manager and she took my number and told me the manager would contact me that day, but I never received a call.

Update- when I checked out of the hotel, the person said a manager would call me to compensate me for my issues with bugs.  For over a week, I called numerous times asking to speak to a manager.  I finally got a refund of $60.  Bid deal I think I deserve more like $200 off.  I'v stayed here several times without an issue until this trip, but I don't think I will ever stay here again."}
{"text":"I would definitely not consider this a resort. 

The hotel concierge was very nice and considerate, and they definitely tried to do their best to make sure that my experience was comfortable, but it was an uphill battle they were facing. 

When I arrived they let me know that their regular rooms were all booked, so they put me in one of their casita-style rooms in the back of the resort. The room itself was extremely dated, with only the basic amenities. I went to open the blinds and they instantly broke-- I let the front desk know and they said someone would come by the next day to fix them. The rugs, walls, and doors were all pretty gross-- I'm sure they vacuumed but that hardly fixes the problem of everything just being old and musty. The bathroom toilet and shower were clean, but the walls had the remains of dead mosquitos all over them. The mosquito problem didn't go away much while I was there, either. 

After getting done with my work day the next day I arrived back to my room to find that 
1. It smelled a little like sewage
2. It had not been cleaned
3. The blinds had not been fixed. 

I called down to the front desk about this and they informed me that in order to \"keep costs down\" they only serviced the room every other day. This was not explained to me upfront, otherwise, I would not have left my towels on the bathroom floor. When I commented that the room smelled funky, they did send someone out with a glade plugin room deodorizer, which was... nice... but doesn't exactly fix the problem of the building smelling like sewage. 

Given how far away this place is from basically EVERYTHING in Phoenix, I don't recommend this resort at all."}
{"text":"The short version: old, not well kept, has bed bugs, friendly staff. Longer version: Staff was pleasant, but they had difficulty with the computer to get us checked in and complained about how old their equipment was (not a good sign).  The parking lot was poorly lit and a little uncomfortable from a safety perspective, but they did have security that was periodically visible. The room required us to walk around to the back of the building which was very desolate at night with plenty of places for someone to hide. As we passed the hot tub outside, we noticed there was no water in it. The room was old and a bit smelly, but not horrible. One wall had holes in it where it looked like a picture used to be.  The air conditioner sits below the exterior window directly connecting to the outside, and as it typical of these antiquated style A/C units it was rather noisy but did work. The beds were nicely made and the television was a modern flat screen. The bathroom had a single sink outside of the toilet/bathtub area. The small closet had a 1ft x 1ft hole in the back wall. Our immediate impression was that this is a two star hotel at best and that we overpaid for what it is. After checking in early evening, we went out and returned around 11:30pm. We had some difficulty getting the TV to work and had to jiggle the HDMI cables in the back to get it to display a picture. After spending less than two hours of time spent in the room, bed bugs appeared. Bed bugs bite and will travel back in your luggage and infest your home given the opportunity.  We didn't want to take any chances and checked out at 1:30AM after getting very little use of the room. When we explained to the front desk why were leaving, they apologized but that was it.  They didn't offer us a different room or any sort of credit. They couldn't even print a final receipt because again they were having issues with their systems. Maybe other rooms are better, but I certainly would never stay there based on our experience."}
{"text":"Dirty!  Definitely not resort quality and they charge you a resort fee.  We booked this off Hotwire and are very disappointed!  They have it mis rated as a 4 star hotel, it's more like a 2 star if that.  I would not recommend this place and the photos may look ok, but it is NOT!"}
{"text":"Great resort for the money.  Loved that we could load up our clubs at our room.  Golf course is in great condition"}
{"text":"Quite a rip off.  This place is very old and smells musky.  I attempted to check in at 5:30PM and was told my room was not ready yet.  I asked for a key card so I could return later; nope.  Don't have a room for you.  Asked when my room might be ready.
\"Maybe an hour and half.\"  It's 5:30 PM and I have to wait another hour and a half until the room is ready.  Who manages this place and who runs a hotel this way.

The \"resort fee\" attached brought a $159.  room to $192.  Give me a break.  How do I use the resort when I can't get into a room until 7 PM.

Would never recommend or ever stay here again."}
{"text":"If I could give less than this many stars I would.  Where do I even begin with this place... I came here to celebrate my grandfather's recent marriage, so my entire family was in town.  I rarely get to see everyone together at once, so I was extremely excited to get together for the weekend.  We finally show up after a long day of travel and the front desk tells us that they OVERBOOKED the hotel and that they are relocating us to a DIFFERENT HOTEL.  My jaw nearly dropped to the floor when hearing this news.  I have never heard of such a thing in my entire life.  So they relocated us to another hotel (a step above a motel 6) 2 miles away, so we were not able to spend any quality time with my family that night.  

The next day we get back to the hotel.  Find out that our room won't be available until 4pm...so we are basically in limbo waiting for a hotel room once again.  Let it be known that the room had been booked for half a year, and they tell us the day of that they have overbooked. Unbelievable!  

Besides not have a room for us (and about 5 other parties at the hotel that weekend!), the service was unbelievable.  We went to the pool with the whole family where we found no towels.  We called and asked for some, and they brought 4 towels (for a party of 15) 2 HOURS later.  We discovered broken glass laying by the side of the pool with kids running around it.  How did they clean it up?  The brought out a leaf blower.  They also used the leaf blower at 12pm and would actually come blow leaves from under where you were sitting while you were trying to relax.  

The rooms look like they are from the 1960s.  Our door was actually deteriorating and falling apart.  The AC unit woke us up during the night because it was so loud.  

On top of that my grandfather has had to go back and forth there for the last week trying to fix all of the charges to everyone's credit cards that they got wrong.  

Overall, this is an experience I will NEVER forget.  Felt like I was in a bad comedy movie while I stayed there.  If I could give it zero stars, I definitely would.  Avoid at ALL possible costs, Motel 6 will have better customer service."}
{"text":"The scenery was amazing!! Wooooooooo!! - Well thats my biggest impression of this place. If you're looking for a great place to golf, i suggest you swing by this place. They give you 5 stars customer service and making sure that you're having the best time of your life."}
{"text":"At glance was looking clean and nice i said when we check in because it was 
After getting something to eat i sat on the bed and bugs jumped on me . Small black fleas . Alive . I put a few in a cup , then began to look at the bed, pull all covers off, bugs, chips snd wood things under all the covers. My husband call front desk, -a person came looked all he ssid was \"not good, housekeeping arent doing their jobs\"
He told us he was off in 5 mins,but he would get someone on it .Hour later still in the room, no one came to help, my husband again called, yes this was last night writting it this morning , i was to upset last night .

After calling them, they said they would send a person to help , now two hours still nothing , .my husband walked to front desk, demanded a new room , got it. They gave him a use of a golf cart , to get our things to one room to the next , it died , we moved ourselves to new room 4 hours later , no help, no sorry, 

The new room was clean, no bugs, ..

So when checking in here make sure and check carefully"}
{"text":"I usually don't like to give less than 5 stars however I called this Resort three times and spoke with 3 different people on different days and all three people were very rude. I'm wondering how they will treat me after they have taken my money?"}
{"text":"After reading some bad review was a bit hesitant to stay here, but my husband had already booked a room. Glad to say it is fine, yes it is a little old and shows some wear but the room was clean and everything works. The staff is nice and pleasant. I am a walker so enjoy that I can walk the trails around the course. They have a shuttle that will take you to some close shopping places. 
The bed and room as a whole was nicely done"}
{"text":"Posting here again since they blocked me on their fb page... I had my wedding here in 2015, I just want to remind anyone who maybe thinking of having there wedding here, DONT! Please message me and I'd be happy to share details. It includes wrong room assignments, three food tastings due to chefs quitting, event planner quitting, oh and best of all they threatened to cancel our wedding if we didn't remove a post in which we were very factual.

The club house restaurant smelled of fresh vomit I would rather stay at a motel 6 at least you get what you pay for this place charges the same price as an actually resort. This place is SOOO notably terrible our bar tender at dinner noticed our room key and said \"ooooh y'all are staying there\". Followed by \"not much of a resort is it\". I can't believe these people are still in business they need to be shut down ASAP."}
{"text":"A bit outdated but the hotel staff took great care of us. The suite style rooms were reasonably priced and golf came with the room!

{"text":"New ownership and it shows!!!   Being restored to former glory.  The front desk was very friendly and free continental
Breakfast convenient and made our mornings easy with two
Kids.  We were given a beach ball by the front desk for the large pool just outside our room....nice so I could keep am eye on them.  We stayed in 500 building so had full kitchen for lunches but ate at the sports bar to enjoy great live music.  

Golf pro put clubs in my kids hands and we hit the driving range having a blast.   

I see the changes in furniture, linens and attitudes and will definitely be back.  Thanks AZ Golf Resort."}
{"text":"REALLY close to homes on the course. If you can't trust your trajectory on every swing I'd stay away. Mediocre course but reasonable price."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and cool. Booked on Golfnow for $12 plus tax and fees. They should have paid me to play the course. Fairways in decent condition, tee boxes were also decent. The worst part of the round was the \"greens\" (sand) every single green was nothing but sand. I've never seen worse \"greens\" in my life, esp in the summer. I definitely don't recommend playing here in the summer"}
{"text":"With the nice looking website and favorable reviews, I had high hopes for this place. Kind of a disappointment. Upon first sight of the resort from the street I felt a little let down, the signage is so old and tacky looking, so I was worried about what the rest of the place would be like.  We were in one of the resort suites which was a separate building that did have the benefit of having it's own pool separate from the main pool.  The one vending machine there was out of order, and the main lobby did not have a little shop that sold drinks or anything which would have been nice to have.  Big gaping whole the the ceiling in the open air hallway area. Lots of work needs to be done, things are falling apart.  The actual room wasn't too bad, decorated better than expected. Not the cleanest though. Long dark hairs on the bathroom floor before anyone had even used it, and none in our party was brunette. The shower head was like 2 feet too short.  And I'm 5'11, you should have seen my 6'2 husband. I had to seriously crank my neck back and bend down to wash my hair. Not a pleasant experience.  The whole tub/shower needs to be replaced. Everything seemed to have layers of dust on it, ESPECIALLY in the kitchen cabinets. Yuck - don't store your food in there until you take a look. 

The free breakfast was good, although we only went once. No parking fee or Internet fee were all good things.

For the resort suites they draw on a little map a very small area to park but it is a shared lot that people also use for private residences? Sketchy. Also very confusing I saw multiple people backing up and looking around trying to find where to go. No clear markings or directions. Didn't matter anyhow because the little lot was full the whole time anyway so we had to park in the main lobby and walk.  The walk wasn't bad but at night you were going through sprinklers and it is not lit at all so you are forced to creep around in the shadows. I would not feel safe if I was doing that walk in the dark alone. 

My husband and his father were supposed to golf two mornings, but after the first decided the one round was plenty. He said groups of people cut in front the them multiple times and the rental clubs were awful.


All these things aren't too major but one thing was really annoying during our stay... We had a rental car during our stay that had it's battery die on us.  We were finally able to get into the car and we decided to go in and ask the front desk if they could call someone in maintenance maybe to get a a jumper cable. We thought it would be quicker and easier than waiting for Alamo to get to us. (We where in a hurry trying to get to a ballgame.) The lady calls maintenance and he says \"we don't do that\". Okay I know it is not their responsibility for the guest's vehicle, but you would think they would care enough about the customer to help fix a problem like that. A resort that size with golf carts and maintenance vehicles all over the place has got to have a jumper cable. Maybe I'm jaded from being from a small town where people give a damn and a complete stranger will go out of their way to help you - I don't know.  We paid $1000 in room stay, and golf. You can't jump our car and help us out on our short vacation? There is an auto shop across the street! You can't call over there and arrange us some help? Unbelievable. I guess they don't know much about common courtesy of helping someone in need out...especially a paying guest. If we were an elderly couple, you think they would have helped us out?  I don't know.  The rooms weren't bad, but I would not come back to Arizona Golf Resort or recommend it.  I can find a clean updated hotel with a better location, nicer pool, and golf else where next time - even if it means paying a little more. Like they say, \"you get what you pay for\"."}

We had a mini suite in the 700's building and It was very spacious and lovely. the grounds are absolutely beautiful, the pool area is very pretty and they had they had the pool heated with toys for the kids, kids had a great time. All the staff were very friendly to us. We especially enjoyed the amazing buffet brunch they had for Easter Sunday.. All the food was absolutely divine. We also enjoyed the karaoke night they had there on Friday night, kids really enjoyed getting up there and singing.  What a fabulous golf course they have, the family and I really enjoyed playing this course. We stay and many resorts and I would highly recommend this one to anyone going the Mesa, Phoenix area. You will really enjoy your stay."}
{"text":"Booked a suite 2 months ahead. Got in town and was told the people hadnt checked out yet, though it was 3.5 hours past checkout time. Was told we \"might\" get another room. What a crock for the price I paid. Only good thing about this sh*t hole was Kathryn at the buffet in the morning. The room smelled like urine. The hot water was cold and cold was hot, not good with my niece who is blind. They have filthy pools. They knew there were five of us yet we only had one roll of toilet paper. Crap. I had to get more off
The housekeeping carts because when I called for it along with a blanket (only sheets on the beds and sleeper sofa) they never came by. Internet is advertised but sucks. Never again. Hit up the motel 6 instead and save your money. Front desk is a joke and the housekeeping is Spanish or Phillipino, so your English is useless here. Parking is also totally insane and you have to walk very far no matter what room number. Location is good and that's all. The end.

Oh yeah, pack of smokes and beer cans on the patio when we got there, what great housekeeping to not even clean."}
{"text":"Got a cheap tee time on golfnow.com course is starting to get a little rough. Practice green is the complete opposite of actually greens. Place seemed a little out dated. Get some updates and it would be a very nice place!"}
{"text":"Worst experience I have had, not only is this place out dated, run down and expensive. There is a charge for everything, we arrived for a weekend, two cars, 3 rooms, we booked through hotels. Com and because we did they charged us for 3 parking spaces, when I told them we only have 2 cars they changed it and said resort fee, no continental breakfast, we were told if we booked direct we would have had the breakfast, other wise it would cost an additional  $11.95,  In the room a coffee machine, but only coffee for one, plus we had paid extra for 3 in one room, and only 2 towels and 2 cups for the coffee, hair dryer didn't work. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Would be 4 stars but you have to pay $9.95 per day for the Internet so that's an automatic downgrade. I'm staying here on the government's dime, so that makes it a little nicer for me since I don't have to pay for any of it, although I'm sure I have the cheapest hotel room in the place. The golf course looks pretty nice and I hear that it is good. The room is decent, though it can be rather loud and the Heater / AC is quite loud. Rooms were clean and nice."}
{"text":"I would give it 0 stars if I could. Checking out now, but I should have left sooner. This isn't a resort at all!  I've been to cheap motels that were a better quality place. Maybe Mr. CEO should stop putting income in his pocket and consider updating this place. Our bathroom has what looks like mold around the base of the tub as well as chips and cracks throughout it. The carpet was crunchy and gross. The kitchen was outdated (microwave from 1985). One of the reasons I choose this place for my daughters 9th birthday getaway was online it stated heated pools. They were not heated. Everything online was a gross misrepresentation of this MOTEL. I would not recommend this place to anyone! As for the staff- cleaning crew were pleasant and very fast. The man up front (evening) was monotone and seemed as if the last place he wanted to be was there. When asked about where anything was located he just simply flung an arm in that direction and stated \"it's over there.\" What?!?! Huge disappointing weekend with a lot of money spent."}
{"text":"Just played Friday after the winter grass went in.  Course is beautiful and very green. The greens are in great shape.  Very reasonable price too. Lacy and Katie are great in the pro shop and Monica is always great in the bar."}
{"text":"This place is a joke!! I came here for a meeting from Las Vegas and I will never stay here again. The rooms are old. The pool was disgusting. It was a murky green color. The front desk was rude when we complained about the pool. Saying we just had to deal with it. I am paying over a hundred dollars a night for this crappy hotel. The staff is rude. The server walked up to us during breakfast, without a hello or good morning to ask us for a breakfast coupon. I had to wait 4 hours for the staff to bring a roll away bed. I will never stay here again!!!"}
{"text":"Check in is ridiculously slow and tedious. There was only one person checking in all customers at all the same check in time.  I tried to check in early they told me it would be 30min turned out to be 2 hours. I understand if I'm checking in early and it takes 2 hours to get the room ready but don't lie and keep telling me 30 min. 
Place is really out dated and room smelled like when you go visit your grandparents house. Room was really dated and had an awkward layout. 
I wouldn't not come again def not worth the money."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with friends. Beautiful holes and greens. Fairways were kept up nicely and the staff was tentative. Even the golf carts were very well maintained.  I will absolutely go back for some more rounds!"}
{"text":"the reviews on here are waay too nice. 

this place is old. the pictures make it look soooo much nicer than it is. 

everything here is old. im pretty sure the alarm clocks are older than me. the tube tv's have a loud hum when you turn them on. 

the room was big, and clean, but it had an almost mildewish kinda smell to it. the bed was large, and wasnt too bad. 

the location is semi central to a lot. but, then again, it is mesa. there's an awesome bagel place around the corner. 

oh, and the toilet. let me tell you... every 5-8 tires, it will actually flush. 

the internet was super slow. if you have an ipad, iphone, or anything that needs updates, dont do it on this wifi. 

all in all, i would have rather stayed at a motel 6. this place must have been cool 2 years ago. i wonder how many people died in that room..."}
{"text":"This is my personal experience, there must be a more positive review out there that is worth your time reading. With this level of outdated property how does their power bill get paid?  This was once a nice place I'm sure. It was last updated in the 70's...the 1870's.  The name sounds like a 5 star but everything else is a 1 star. Again, in my experience the filfhy carpeted rooms were frayed and smelled like feet that just came out of a pair of boots after working on a paving job on the highway in the summer.  I felt that the golf course was tired and dry patches were everywhere. The  \"houses\" that line this once proud course are eyesores. Short review, it is a motel 6 with a fancy sounding name but with more older crusty/fluid splashed items shoved into the tiny rooms. My theory of how anyone can honestly say it is more than a 1 star, is either they are sponsored to post good reviews or they are being held hostage by the owners of the property and must post positive reviews.  Do not pass go...go directly to jail, it's nicer.  The staff at the course were exceptional and I am sure trying their best to put lipstick on this pig."}
{"text":"I decided to check in for one night, I was excited because it looked nice online..
I checked in and they couldn't make me any keys so they had the handy man on the resort drive me to my room in his golf cart full of tools, we get to \"my\" room and he opened the door and there was already people in there so he shut the door and paged the office to tell them. They sent me to another room \"the nicer rooms\" it was a room on the second floor with a kitchen, bedroom, living room and private balcony (with no view btw) it was nicer but no not what I would expect a resort to any means. About a hour later the handy man brought me my new room keys finally, I guess the key machine started working. I guess I got upgraded to this room. It felt like I stepped right into the 80s. The room was super dated. Old wall paper that's cracking and gross, old stove, old couches and lamps. The bed as in comfort was nice. I did sleep well..
The door doesn't lock properly at all which is unsettling.
Parking lot is sketch. I was worried about my car getting rob. I am not sure if there is another side of the \"resort\" where its actually a resort because these rooms look and feel like old apartment buildings that they tried to make into a hotel. Its definitely not at all what I expected and I wish I could get a refund because everything about my stay besides the good nights sleep was bad. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. I'm not sure about their golf but as for their rooms its a no go for me. 
The price is decent for what you get but with how dated things are it should be less. 
I wouldn't stay here again. It shouldn't be labeled as a resort and I don't know how they are rated a 3 star.. I don't see it. I see a 1 star maybe..

NO FREE BREAKFAST!! How does a \"resort\" not offer a free breakfast? So disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is very lacking, to say the least. Our large party for a baseball tournament arrived to find our rooms had no phones, clock radios, missing remotes, tv's not working, no coffee, etc. The process just to turn the tv on was amazing! The furniture was dirty and at least 30 years old. Parking is an issue, especially if you have a large vehicle or truck. Spaces are extremely small and hard to get in and out of. The front desk service was not very good. Ladies were rude and not helpful. The grounds staff were nice though. Overall, for the price, this place is a huge disappointment. I would not stay here again."}
{"text":"How can I put into words the excellence of this establishment..? Well here's a try: 

a) Front Desk: Friendly and expedient. Put up with some very bad jokes and gave a pretty convincing potty chuckle.

b) Golf Starter: Excellent tips. Didn't help us though, because we all missed the fairway..

c) Course: AWESOME! Great layout, greens rolling like an 18 wheel trucker, fairways trickin like Phil Dumphy, and the friendliest beverage cart service professional I've ever had the pleasure of buying beer from.

d) Bar 425 (After round food and drank): This was probably the best part of the round. TV's all around to watch every game that was on. Cold beer and perfect atmosphere. Deals, deals, deals, damn deals!!!! Oh wait, there's more?? Yep. There's a house se band! Apparently they clicked their heels together last night and \"tore it up\". When we showed up in the place afterwards, there were still old men hanging from the rafters.


Epic place, great people. I'll be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"The Arizona Golf Resort is one of the best value courses around. You cannot beat the quality of course for what you pay. They have new nice carts, friendly staff, and quality playing surfaces. 

Well worth every penny spent."}
{"text":"This place needs a lot of updating. We stayed for a dance competition at the hotel and were very disappointed to check in to our room, it was dark, dreary and dirty. There were 4 nightstands in a room with one bed, we figured we had the room where the old furniture went to die. Odd. Sinks were cracked and stained in both the bathroom and kitchenette. The floor of the bathroom around the toilet was very hot...the rest of the bathroom floor wasn't, very weird, but i didn't want to think about it too much, kinda gross. We were excited to see a mini fridge in the room and a grocery store across the street. Unfortunately, even at the lowest setting, all our food in the fridge froze. Free breakfast was nice to include, but I had to check through two plates to find a clean one then ask for new serving tings because there was hair on one and the other was broken. I only paid $95 a night for the room, I guess you get what you pay for.  At least the staff was friendly"}
{"text":"Made reservations for Sunday brunch 1 o'clock today Sunday ,  arrived 10  minutes early long line to the door, the people  reservations and people  waiting for a table all in the same line no respect at all for people with reservations. I was told by the hostess people they seated at 10 AM we're still there eating at 1,  they had no tables. We were seated about 30 minutes later. When walking to our table there was probably 20 tables full of dirty dishes and nobody was cleaning. The food quality, go to Golden corral if that tells you how bad this was most of the food was cold, they had carrot soup no bowls to put the soup in, they had rolls those little cheap ones you can get at the dollar store stale in the warner no butter anywhere the desserts were frozen,  just like you would get at the Chinese buffet only the Chinese buffets are better, but  the desserts were mostly pastries you buy in the bread aisle at the grocery store, in a little plastic tray and they have like grape or cream cheese  there were plates of those around. the meat in the carving area they said was the leg of lamb but there was no leg so I don't know what it was and it looked like they were pouring broth over  it I couldn't eat it it was bad. There we're no pieces of salmon in the warmer just some leftover bits, and the green beans the tag said it was green beans but it had like three carrots left and there were no green beans. I mention that to the gentleman working the table, he just walked away. The mac & cheese was watered down the kind you make with powder they had  A pan of polenta but it was liquid like grits they had an omelette bar but not many items on it. And the shrimp was good it was the kind that comes in a bag and you just serve it they didn't have to do much for that. They also had a few kinds of cheeses but you can tell most of it was picked through. The eggs Benedict was premade in a warmer that was soggy and scrambled eggs The cost was 39.99 Per person when I got the bill for two it was 106 because they add a gratuity in advance. This was the worst buffet I have ever been to in my life let alone being an Easter brunch. the general manager of this hotel and the food and beverage director that I allowed this to happen and to serve this quality, and thought it was OK should be terminated, I should have gone to Golden corral and that's not good but it's a lot better than this place was. And as a bonus there is a whole boiled egg sitting in the almost empty Kroc of ranch dressing on the salad bar that should've been my clue to leave it at the beginning."}
{"text":"This place was probably the place to stay in the 70's when it first opened (or from whatever decade this outdated furniture is from). From its beautiful scenery you would not be able to tell any  different. When you first walk in, you get a musty smell, like your great great grandmothers house. (Which makes sense, because there all old people staying here). You set your bags down, and look around at the furniture, but try not to judge. Then you go to turn on the lamp above the sink and it flickers for 5 seconds before it actually turns on (really)? There is dust all around the room. My coworker said he found two huge mosquitos in his room. I went to the restaurant two separate times: the first time just stood there awkwardly in a completely empty dining room for a few minutes waiting for someone, ANYONE, to appear. Second time came around breakfast time, stood there for a few minutes and still was not greeted so I left for the second time and spent my money elsewhere. I could go on. I expected much more out of a privately owned \"Golf Resort.\""}
{"text":"They call this a resort? I'm not one to complain and leave reviews but this place is horrible. We booked it as a 4 Star resort/golf/Spa.  NOT EVEN CLOSE. Whoever took their website pictures is either the best photographer ever or they are fake- this place probably was nice 25 years ago, but dirty common areas, the amenities are more \"Hotel 6\" than a resort. Seriously, calling this place a resort is 100% false advertising."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed staying here.  The rooms haven't been updated since Dirty Dancing was in theaters, but the staff is so friendly, the views of the gold course are excellent, the food is decent, and the price for what you get can't be beat.  Also the rooms have kitchenettes and there is a grocery store across the street so you can save some money.  P.S. Yolanda at the front desk has to be the nicest person I have ever met working at a hotel!"}
{"text":"This was the most expensive crappy hotel I've stayed at. We booked through Hotwire and we'll never do that again. In the pictures you'll see a common door to the other room. Stains on the shower tub. The wallpaper was peeling. Our microwave and clock was from the 80's. I didn't share the picture but our door that leads outside had a huge gap that a snake could fit through. Yea $230/night should have just stayed at a Motel 6."}
{"text":"We stayed here because it was cheap and close to my brother's house.

Were we ever pleasantly surprised!  The people were nice here, the room is huge, there's a 'fridge and microwave in the room too.

I like this place, we'll stay here again."}
{"text":"The rooms are not nearly as nice as the pictures online on their site look. First room we had, featured brick walls and smelled like a dirty wet basement. It took 4 calls and 2 trips to the front desk complaining to finally get a different room. The last straw for the first room was when they started jack hammering the main pool at 8 am. 8 AM! Next room was slightly better. Super disappointed they also decided to start construction on the pool, of course not letting the guests that plan to stay there know  that the main pool will not be usable and the entire place has just the secondary pool to use.  We had guests in one of the 1 bedroom suites to and their place stunk even worse....and the air conditioning would trip the breaker every 20 minutes of use. All the furniture we saw was mismatched and decades old. Definitely not a resort. The front desk had people coming in complaining every time we were up there. False advertising if I have ever seen one."}
{"text":"Pretty old and dirty, has not been updated I'm many years. The ceiling in the bathroom is falling apart"}
{"text":"This place is a tale of two hotels. 

First and foremost, the grounds are quite nice. It's a very big resort, in terms of footprint, with tons of buildings scattered quite a distance from each other. If you have mobility issues or the weather is bad, I can see that being a pain. Since neither was the case when I was there, I liked it a lot. The restaurant inside is good, though not spectacular. Meeting rooms are quite nice. People are incredibly friendly, both at the front desk and in terms of banquet staff. Pools look nice, but I never used one. 

The rooms are a different story. Apparently they are trying to sell the hotel, so they have done no renovations. You can tell. It's very clean, but just old and worn out. I was upgraded to a big suite with a full kitchen (incl oven), and it was certainly more space than I needed for a few nights. The TVs are old with very few channels. The WiFi is very poor. The bathroom is small and the shower head is suitable for a 5 year old, in terms of height. Beds are comfortable. The patio is quite nice, as mine overlooked the 18th green (I believe it was the 18th). 

If this place gets updated, I could see it being fantastic. But as of now, the rooms bring down the otherwise nice place."}
{"text":"Emily was very helpful with us checking in and out! Nice clean rooms, beautiful view! Amazing stay at the Arizona Golf Resort!"}
{"text":"I would like to give this place a zero if it would let me. My best friend had her wedding here the first Friday of November and I would like to preface that the ceremony was beautiful and I am so happy for my friend that this place did not completely ruin the best day of her life. PLEASE DO NOT HAVE YOUR EVENT HERE! IT IS THE MOST DISORGANIZED VENUE I HAVE EVER BEEN AT OR INVOLVED WITH!
Let's begin on Thursday, they had told the bride that we could come in whenever on Thursday to set up our own decor, that all of the tables and silverware would be set up, then we could go and have the rehearsal that evening. We got there at 5 pm. The bride immediately told the gentlemen that were setting up tables that the room itself was supposed to be bigger. It was one of those rooms with the collapsible walls, and only one half of the room was open. He basically told her that he just works there and that he would go get the person in charge. While we were waiting for the \"person in charge\" we also noticed that there were supposed to be 8 tables of 8 and there were only 5 tables of 8, also the wedding party's head table was supposed to be 14 and there were 20 chairs. Then we noticed that there was no cake table, gift table, or sign in table set up. Then the bride started asking the \"person in charge\" why everything was incorrectly set up and why is it just now getting done when she was told it should have been ready in the MORNING of that day, this \"person in charge\" basically started the blame game. That everyone else is new there except her and the notes she was given were wrong and blah blah excuse after excuse. There was not a SINGLE apology or comment that they were going to FIX any of the issues. A little later the \"person in charge\" came up to the bride and told her that they will make it perfect for her and that for the inconvenience they would throw in white chair covers and black bows for free. The bride was happy with that and we decided to go and do the rehearsal and come back for the rest of the table decorations once the tables were set up. That is about when Nora got there. Now, I had heard from the bride that there had been multiple people that she had worked with at the venue since they booked the wedding there so I was trying to give the benefit of the doubt to this Nora. She was very nice and said that she would walk us to where the ceremony area was and that if anyone needed a ride she would have a golf cart bring them. While we were walking to the ceremony area, we passed the area that the cocktail hour was to be and we noticed that there were two beautiful fountains and a series of lights, the bride confirmed that the day of the wedding those would all be turned on and Nora said yes. Then we went back into the rehearsal hall. The only real thing that they got done was open the room, expand the dance floor and add the tables. We had to remove the extra chairs from the head table and also had to continuously tell the \"person in charge\" that half of the mirror chargers on the center of the tables were chipped and we kept noticing that they were just putting those on DIFFERENT tables when we asked for not chipped ones. Since none of the \"free chair covers or bows\" were set up yet, we decided that we would just go ahead and go to our rehearsal dinner activity, that we were already behind schedule for, and finish decorating in the morning. When we left the bride confirmed that the bridal suite that we were getting ready in would be ready at 6 AM and Nora confirmed that and that the groomsman all had golf booked for the morning at 7ish. ALL confirmed by Nora. Fast forward to the next day, the day of the wedding. One of the bridesmaids arrived before us and went to check into the room. They asked her what room number she is in and could not check her in. They basically told her that there was not a room ready. That was when she called the bride, the bride then called Nora and it went to voicemail. She tried a couple more times all going to voicemail. Our first bridesmaid did end up getting a room and once we got there it was fine. Then we checked on the reception hall. Well, all of the tables were set up and the room looked overall fine. However, the \"free chair covers and bows\" looked AWFUL they were SUPER wrinkled and only maybe 6 chairs had the bows. Also, we brought our own candles for the centerpieces but they were supposed to provide oil candles for the head table and the sign in table. Those were no where to be found. Then back at the bridal suite, we were all starting to get ready and the bride gets a phone call from the groom saying that the golf was not booked. That they could not get on the green until 10 AM. Now the wedding started at 3:45 PM. That was when the bride called Nora again and it again went to voicemail.The Groom had to put his foot down and basically figure out the golf situation by himself due to the lack of response from Nora. I have to cut this off but DO NOT USE THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"Wow!! This hotel (resort) exceeded our expectations! We were a little concerned after reading some of the reviews, but our experience was nothing but exceptional...especially after we had an AWFUL experience the night before at another hotel down the street, it was so horrendous that we checked out and headed to Arizona Golf Resort after my brother went and checked it out. He and his family asked if they could see one of the rooms before we committed to anything and they gladly took all 5 of them around in a golf cart to view several rooms. In fact, they even repeated that service when my brother then returned later with my dad so he could see the resort. My father, who is very picky, gave the resort a thumbs up. We loaded up our luggage and headed to our lovely home for the next week! We were greeted by Yolanda who was so welcoming and could not have been more accommodating. She was pleasant to work with, we desperately needed new accommodations for our family of 8 and she saw to it that we were placed next to each other, close to the pool and golf clubhouse. The  suites were clean, updated, well maintained and extremely roomy and the beds were very comfortable with crisp white sheets. Whenever we needed more towels, bedding for the pullout or extra toiletries, they were prompt in coming out to our room and the front desk followed up with a courtesy call to make sure we received our amenities. The complimentary breakfast was an added bonus. There are two pools, but we hung out at the main pool for our visit. It was very clean and there was a covered cabana with plenty of comfortable seating and tables for the older folks to get out of the sun for a bit. Thomas (the food and beverage director) was super friendly and helpful as well. He made sure that we were taken care of poolside and whenever we ran into him on the property, he greeted us with a friendly hello and asked how our stay was and if we needed anything. I would not hesitate one bit to return to the Arizona Golf Resort. Everything about our trip was fantastic thanks to the kind staff at this resort. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I fully acknowledge that I'm probably not target audience for this place.  I attended a professional conference and stayed here for four nights.  I don't golf, so I can't comment on that but...

The accommodations were alright (400's a suite)-I don't have incredibly high standards, but the furniture in our suite was rather dated and appeared as though it hadn't been updated since 1992.  Everything was clean, and I can tolerate outdated much better than dirty.  While I don't need a flat screen tv, I do appreciate one that does not have diagonal fuzzy lines through the picture, the channel selection was also slim.  The biggest issue for me was the internet connection.  I couldn't stream video because the connection was less than 1MBPS download.  The 'fitness center' was a rather remote location and a bit dismal.  

We did have a hospitality suite on the other side of the resort (700's maybe) and it was actually quite nice, very updated and modern, so perhaps that is part of the varied reviews here-that some of the buildings/rooms have been renovated and others have not.

The actual conference facility/meeting rooms were acceptable.  The outdoor space was quite nice and enjoyable.  I had no complaints on the food.  The staff were also decently accommodating.  Though, when I asked about getting transportation into Phoenix, I was met with a blank stare-like no one staying here had ever asked such a thing.

O, and there is a replica of the Ponderosa homestead made by Lorne Greene (Ben Cartwright in the show) on site.  Yeah, that went off the air 10 years before I was born, but the family that runs it is quite nice.  By the end of the event, I had heard a rumor that the facility was in bankruptcy and bank owned which accounted for the lack of updates.

All in all, if I had the chance to stay here again, I would probably only do so if I got a great rate ($100 or less)"}
{"text":"Our family spent 3 days here, even our fur babies! 
The resort is huge. We stayed in the King Casita, which is essentially a one bedroom apartment. They accommodations are lovely, I was very pleased to find the kitchen is fully stocked with everything I needed to prepare meals. They have a lovely restaurant and bar/grill here and we did go out to eat lunch one afternoon and was very please with the menu and loved The staff they were so friendly and helpful thank you very much all of you. They have three huge pools,  two separate Jacuzzis and obviously a golf course 18 holes. And did you know which I did not that Lauren Green build a duplicate house from the show bonanza it's out there in the middle the golf course. And walking around on our daily walks we discovered that this resort offers apartments town houses houses hotel rooms salon I was just blown away by all that was offered here. Most importantly a huge thank you to the staff everyone with that we met very respectful helpful.  We would definitely be back"}
{"text":"Terrible on many levels!  The room was terribly dirty.  Two dirty towels were left on the floor. The ice box had water in it and sticky stuff all over.  The light fixtures were missing light bulbs.  The light by the bed was not plugged in and the headboards were not moveable so we could not access the plug in.  There was someone else's charger left in the room.  Clearly, housekeeping did not do their job.  Beyond that though, at check in I asked about complimentary breakfast and was told where/when to access it.  In the morning, after we ate (a not very good) breakfast we were told we didn't have it.  When I complained to management about all of these things, I was simply told they would \"write it down.\"  There were no apologizes or offers to correct.  Avoid this place!!"}
{"text":"Arizona Golf Resort is amazing! The course is fair yet challenging.  The food is second to none. The staff is first class and truly cares about your experience from when you pull into the resort parking lot and will even follow up on your experience afterwards. 

On a side note, I'd like to personal thank Angie, the cart girl for all the fun out on the course. Gina in the restaurant took care of us and who ever cooked our food should have their own reality cooking show. 

Can't say enough great things about this place. Take the family and come check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"This resort was the second time we used RESORTPASS online and booking was just as simple. Checking in was a bit more tedious than The Kierland Westin Resort. Desk clerks had a bit more dry personality, but that's ok.

There was more variety in pools! The lazy river moved quicker along with some extra perks (sprinkler fountains and water waves), which is probably why they don't allow drinks on their river :( They also have a wave pool and some pretty huge water slides for those of you interested.

Another downside, nobody bothered to wait on us when we were seated, so we had to order drinks at the bar and then go over and order food at the dining court. Virgin-Daiquiri's were super yummy!  Nachos were decent, cheese is questionable, & a bit pricey ($20+)

Probably a one-time experience for us =/"}
{"text":"This resort is a must if you're going to Mesa! The entire staff went out of their way to ensure we were well taken care of. When we asked Thomas for a good Mexican food/margarita recommendation, he brought us margaritas from the resort's bar to sample and printed out information on the best and closest restaurants (and even called to confirm their hours!). Samuel sweetly drove us around in a golf cart and waited on us if we were going to be a few minutes. Reuben at the golf course was helpful with course information and booking a tee time. Every staff member is friendly, helpful and seems to really enjoy their job. We will be back as soon as possible!!!"}
{"text":"The round was good. I didn't enjoy being pared with 2 walkers while we were in the cart but it didn't really affect us."}
{"text":"Customer service was great and the scenery is amazing! Love the fact that everything is very conveniently close by!"}
{"text":"I stayed many a moon at the Golf Resort back in the 90's when it was the ONLY place to stay anywhere near Power Road and it was actually pretty much in the middle of nowhere with nothing of interest around it except for a HEB grocery nearby and a smattering of restaurants that closed at 9:00 because nearly all the nearby residents were retirees.  Imagine that!

Nice spacious rooms and a great place to get together as a group and grill outside on their grills, and if you played golf that was even better.  I understand it's showing her age these days and is probably due for some updating.  Still, it was a great place and hopefully will remain so."}
{"text":"I love this place every time I go here the customer service is great. I went to a wedding and the room was so nice decorated. I been in the pool and its always clean. The environment is quiet you don't see crazy people around there. They have a big parcking lot as well. The golf camp is very nice. About the rooms they are big and more important they are very clean. I recommend this place !!"}
{"text":"The room was clean and spacey so that's why I at least gave them one star but this is ABSOLUTELY NOT A 4 star resort. The bed was lumpy, they had no room service, no ice machines, the view from our room window was the old discarded tennis court with old mattresses and furniture. The walls were so thin we could hear our neighbors all night moving around. Anyone can go in and out from the street onto the resort. My husband and I were very disappointed."}
