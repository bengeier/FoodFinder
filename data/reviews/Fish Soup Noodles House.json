{"text":"Quick service didn't make up for the poor quality. 

So the menu is like a choose your own adventure novel; in that you are given several options for your noodle and you mark your selection. You get to choose your soup base, noodle type and 2 included toppings. The soup comes with several toppings already (but we didn't know that until the food arrived). 
We ordered 2 bowls: one with fish soup and the other Malaysian curry soup. Both soups were quite mildly flavoured, bordering on bland. 
Noodles were decent, nothing really out of the ordinary. I doubt they make them in house, so really, can't really give them that much credit. 
Toppings... Talk about skimping on ingredients. 2 slices of fish and 1 fish ball. Make up my two toppings. I'm not sure if they really meant two toppings and gave me a free slice of fish. 
Also ordered a plate of boiled veggies. Sandy sandy veggies. Apparently washing them is not part of the process. 

My hk style tea, how did you go wrong? Sigh... Might as well give me sugar syrup. 

can you tell I'm not a fan?"}
{"text":"Let me begin by explaining that I *hate* fish soup.

Then let me say that this place has the first fish soup that I've enjoyed. Lacking that really fishy flavor that overpowers the tastebuds, the taste of the broth is instead smooth and rich.

They also serve several light snacks that only run you up to $3.50 a plate. Served in an almost tapas/omakase style, you can get several of these small items (ranging from deep fried fish skin to chicken skewers) to share amongst a group.

For my trip to this establishment, I personally decided to order a curry beef rice just to be different. Surprisingly, this turned out to be quite good! The brisket was tender and not stringy, and there was a perfect amount of fat. The curry itself was slightly spicy but not overpoweringly so, and there were also potatoes! Not enough Chinese places still serve potatoes with their curry.  

FSNH hasn't been open for too long, so it might take some time for everything to fall into place for them, but they've definitely got some tasty grub and nice service. If you want a cheap dinner with lots of variety, try it out! And for a full review with more pictures, check out my food blog, located in my profile. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Just went for the 6th time in the past 2 months.  I've notice the soup has been a little diluted compare to when I first went.  I hope it's not going to go downhill from here.  

But amazing fish soup (without MSG), keeps you so so warm.  Try the deep fry fish skin if you haven't try it, it's amazing."}
{"text":"Quick service, delicious fish soup.

You get to choose your soup base, noodle type, and topping.  Love how you can customize your own meal."}
{"text":"I had suspicions that -=healthy=- Chinese/Cantonese Food trends don't come directly from Hong Kong/Guangdong, China.
It stops over in Richmond, BC then eventually if ever lands in Markham/Richmond Hill, ON.
The question is if that trend is sustainable and fact is some do not make it beyond the growth/survival period.

Deer Garden Signatures in Richmond, BC has very similar Menu designs while FS Noodle House has less Soup Base options.
Related business or not, Chinese like their Seafood and Fish Soup/Broth is no different.
When making your own, remember to FRY the Fish first to give the Broth a milky color and remove the Fishy taste.

In this House, it's hard but not impossible to avoid the...

Fish Noodle Soup($7.50)(Choice Soup Base + Noodle + 2 Toppings)

#1 - Soup Base
} Original Fish Soup

#2 - Noodle
} Round Noodle (Guilin)

#3 - Toppings
} Sliced Fresh Tilapia (yes! Boneless finally)

--------------
It actually arrived with more Toppings than I checkmarked.
Beancurd Sheets, Imitation Crab, Shitake Mushroom, Daikon included.

Toppings nice and Fish Broth has depth and balance.
Remember to get side-order of Deep Fried Fish Skin for dipping!

Noodle me.  I'm adding Extra Noodle($1.00) next time.
Maybe even do Hot Pot, it will be that season soon enough."}
{"text":"The place actually is not closed; I went today. Though not packed at dinner time, you can choose your own soup stock, noodles and toppings. Food was okay and service was okay. The waiter didn't understand much english or cantonese."}
{"text":"Being a huge fan of fish soup noodles (fish is healthy food!), I suggested to try this place out with my friends since we were in the area.

We arrived late afternoon and were the only patrons seated in the restaurant.  Looking at the menu, I found it a bit confusing so I asked the waiter how I can order my favourite fish soup noodles.  Turns out we need to choose the soup base, noodles, and choice of 2 toppings (cheaper if you don't want the extra toppings, already has a few toppings inside).  We also ordered the curry beef rice w/ side fish soup, and an appetizer (marinated egg with tofu dish).

My opinion of the food was mediocre.  The fish soup was a bit bland/diluted, and the curry was too spicy.  I suppose bland means no MSG and thus healthier, but I like my soup noodles with flavour and would have preferred more ingredients in the soup to make it more flavourful.  

Overall a great place if you like to custom pick and choose the ingredients for your fish soup noodle.  Worth trying out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Fish Soup Noodles House as the name suggests specialized in soup noodles... and the menu reflects that. 

You choose 
soup base: fish, chicken or Thai 
noodles:udon, vermicelli, flat rice noodles, glass noodles, etc 
2 toppings for free: beef, briskets, pork, fish, dumplings etc extra toppings $1.50 each 

Then you have your custom soup noodles!!! 

Aside from noodles there are some snacks starting around $2... 

My combination Noodle: 

Fish Soup Based Vermicelli with fresh fish slice and fish tofu ($7.50) 
- The broth was surprising good... rich and milky white.. green onions and parsley helps lessen the fishy taste.. 
- The toppings though was not plentiful.. 4 small slices of fish..but at least was really fresh..and 3 fish tofu which I found was so-so 
- Vermicelli is of medium thickness.. I found it really soggy and too soft for my taste.. 

My snack:

Steamed Fish Siu Mai ($2) 
- The siu mai made solely of fish meat and fillings.. pretty decent tasting 
- however the siu mai was served lurk warm.. if they would have them up a little, they would have tasted so much better!! 

Fish Soup Noodles House is great for singles or small groups since there are a lot of small tables and since you just order your own bowl..so eating alone is no problem. 

They still have the heating elements on the tables from Dow Noodles Hot Pot.... Maybe they can start to serve fish soup hot pot next winter!
