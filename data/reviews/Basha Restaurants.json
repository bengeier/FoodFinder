{"text":"Basha provides good food at a reasonable price.  I've been twice and ordered the Combo Platter both times along with some Baklava.  Both times the food was excellent and enough to fill two people.  The Baklava is some of the better Baklava that I have had...  I found asking for extra sauce is sometimes good in case the meat is drier than you like."}
{"text":"This was located in the underground mall food court-Central District. Good for a quick bite. The shawarma was filling and very reasonable priced. Although tasted saltier than I would have liked."}
{"text":"I've never eaten Lebanese before, but I thought this was really pretty good. I wandered in off the street w/out so much as looking at a review and was pleasantly surprised. I had the chicken platter which came with humus, a salad (looked perhaps like kale), rice and garlic potatoes all for $10. Will definitely come back. Would have gone 5 stars if I had some basis for comparison, but w/out one, hard for me to say \"as good as it gets,\" but it could be darn close!"}
{"text":"Ate here the other day and the food was delicious, but it used to be way better, five stars way better, but they never kept the place up and it shows with all the dirt and crud near the windows with a nice view to Saint-Catherine. The chairs and tables are old and somewhat grimy and the kitchen needs an overhaul. If they can afford it, they should renovate and become the Lebanese go-to that it used to be.  Also, the people working there were not as nice, not nearly as nice.  Com'on guys, get this place fixed up before nobody comes back."}
{"text":"Good middle eastern food with their own local twists.  Reminded me of McDonald's cuz there were so many of these in Montreal.  I thought the shawarma was a little dry but the other food was great.  Lots of variety and fairly quick.    Another chain Amir seemed very comparable as well.  Prices are similar and food is too.  Amir had a hot buffet though that I didn't see as much at Basha.  Different locations vary though."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place although it wasn't amazing. Located on the second floor of a small shopping mall, this place gets quite crowded during lunch hours. Prices are quite inexpensive and the chefs are really quick. Basha is one of these places where you order your meat and then select your sides. This style is quite common in Montreal and ordering for foreigners is not complicated at all. The decor is simple and cafeteria style. I ordered the gyro plate along with salad, rice, and potatoes along with a white sauce. This meal was quite large and was definitely big enough for lunchtime. The meat was thinly sliced and was juicy. The potatoes were fantastic and the rice was perfect. While I wasn't really getting any authentic Lebanese flavors, it was filling. I enjoyed this place, but if on vacation for only a limited time, I wouldn't recommend it because there are better places. However, if here for a while or in need of a quick lunch, this place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"There are multiple Basha locations throughout the downtown Montreal area and the quality of the food does tend to differ. The flagship location is located on Rue St. Catherine, in the same complex as Sports Experts, what sets Basha apart from the competition (Boustan, Amir's) are the daily specials which are heaping portions of quality for a small price, the Mloukhia (Jew's Mallow served over rice and chicken topped off with a garnish of vinegar and onions) warrants a special mention and is served on Sundays and Mondays.   Basha also is the best place in Montreal for cheap Middle Eastern staples  (read: Shish Taouk/Shawarma) and is definitely one of the best places to go if you want to grab a gianoromous meal for 10$ or less."}
{"text":"Five years ago this would have been one of my favorite spots for Lebanese food but I think the wheels have fallen of since then. This last visit to montreal the service was poor, which would be forgiven if the food was good, but it wasn't. Both the Chicken and falafel were dry to say the least.  Pricey and poor, if your in montreal there are way more options available."}
{"text":"The garlic sauce is very watery and bad. The owner gives you a tiny cup for drinks, and says that you can \"come back for a refill once\". Clearly just trying to gouge money by betting that most people won't bother lining up for a refill. There are medium and large cups there too, so it's not like he didn't have those.  Go someplace else."}
{"text":"Whoever thought that you can find great Middle Eastern food in Montreal? You have to walk upstairs to Basha. When you enter, it looks like a cafeteria.   It was an easy choice. You select the combo (#1-10). This place is always crowded. They spice it right! I like everything. And they were very generous with the portions.   And the price, is unbelievably affordable.  This definitely tops one of my favorite Middle Eastern place"}
{"text":"They have good quality foods.  It's heavy meals though and the price is sort of around average I guess :)"}
{"text":"L'ancien endroit nous donnait beaucoup plus de choix. C'était presque une institution à Montréal malheureusement ils ont dû déménager au sous-sol chez Simons. J'y vais encore pour le couscous et le taboulé toujours très bon. Ce n'est pas de la haute gastronomie mais c'est de la bonne bouffe."}
{"text":"I remember when I was in university roughly 12 years ago Basha was considered \"The Essentials\" of middle eastern food in Montreal. Wow, it went down. Went back this summer (I visit Montreal often) and decided to have it again... not bad but something was truly missing. Boustan and Al Taib are miles away from this place. Least flavoured meat I had tasted and bland potatoes. It will do the trick if you are hungry, but go a few blocks away and have a nice Boustan. Much better choice"}
{"text":"I love this place. When I lived in Vermont I would make the two hour trip north to go eat here. Plus the great shopping when the US dollar was worth more. The food is utterly amazing a must even if you are not a fan of middle eastern food. Never had a bad meal here. Always quality and at a great price."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times....always great...and a visual feast too since all the food is presented out front.....food is fresh and tasty.....my favorite restaurant in Montreal."}
{"text":"I first visited Basha last weekend and was so impressed with their falafel sandwich that I made it a point to revisit today.   Last week the sandwich was stuffed with fresh, moist falafel, hummus, garlic sauce and salad. The juices were literally dripping from the sandwich when I ate it.   Today the sandwich was so dry it was almost inedible. I would have returned it but I was a good ways away when I sat down to eat it. To make matters worse my fountain soda was flat!  There are so many places to try that it's hard to forgive such flagrant inconsistency."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant and this coming from someone with a Lebanese background haha Plates are big and very fulfilling!"}
{"text":"I've gotta admit, the Quebecois make better middle eastern food than Chicagoans.  Basha is a local chain with multiple locations. This particular one is located near the downtown area.  We had lunch one day while staying at the Omni nearby and returned the next day. Yeah, it was that good. The lamb shawerma is tender, juicy, and flavorful. The shish kabobs are excellent. The roasted potatoes with garlic yogurt sauce make for a great side item.  It is sorta dive-y, not a fancy place. But, the food is excellent and inexpensive. A definite visit for quick, great, and inexpensive food."}
{"text":"We went here the Moroccan guy was very rude. Personnel has no people skills. Food is low-quality and not spiced, such as: dry rice, dry salad, and dry meat. They boast about their shawarma but it's nasty. And no refills for 2$ drink. Not a happy experience. I will never eat here."}
{"text":"Location: Heart of downtown, above Sports Experts.  Service: Pretty quick but friendliness isn't always on the menu. Depends on the day.  Food: I like Basha, though have found that the quality and savoriness of the food varies based on location. I usually order the Shish Taouk plate or the veggie platter. Sometimes they're delicious and sometimes the chicken has fatty bits and the Falafel is dry. It's hit or miss. I think that going during lunch hour is a safe bet because there's a good rotation and nothing stays on the skewers or in the display too long.  I LOVE their garlic sauce and usually stop by when I'm sick - I order the Shish and ask for extra garlic sauce that I eat with a spoon! Sounds gross, I KNOW but it does a damn good job of nuking the germs let me tell you.  Price: Average. I'd say $10 depending on what you order."}
{"text":"I'm hungry and this is the only place near Metropolis that doesn't look like it will stab me. The shawerma was dry but I was so hungry that it tasted better than gold. (Not that gold would taste great.)"}
{"text":"What's up with all the crazy love for Basha here?  Someone driving two hours from Vermont just to eat there?  You gotta be kidding me.  Sure, Basha's the best Middle Eastern chain in Montreal but that's sorta like calling chlamydia the best sexually transmitted disease. I jest. I actually eat there when I'm downtown cause there's not much else in the area (and I might've given it three stars but feel the need to balance out the five star lunacy).  If you like greasy meat on a stick, salads soggy from soaking in too much cheap oil and vinegar (and oh so much vinegar -  it makes the salads stomach-churningly sour) and shish taouk made from the gristliest chicken this side of Kentucky, then it might be your favorite place in town. For others, it's a passable place to go when the stomach is growling and there's nothing else in sight besides food courts and McDonalds..."}
{"text":"Viande moyennement cuite, cadre vieillot et prix relativement cher pour ce que c'est... Faut vraiment avoir faim pour y aller !"}
{"text":"My least favourite restaurant of this type in Montreal.  Food is consistently dry and not as fresh as the other restaurants.  Go somewhere else.  Anywhere else."}
{"text":"Really nice place to grab lunch. Came up from Boston with some buddies for the f1 weekend and this spot is right in the center of everything and very reasonable prices as well. The food was splendid as well and everybody that got their things were fully satisfied. Generous portions of food and everything's halal for my fellow Muslims. All in all great place for a quick break and some delicious food for pretty much anyone!"}
{"text":"The kabobs are delicious here.  I especially loved the convenience (as it was right near our hotel) and the whole simple ordering system they have set up.  Making this my first meal, after a long cross country flight (from SF to Montreal), was a no brainer and very enjoyable."}
{"text":"This place is solid for fast Lebanese food. It is \"fast food\", so it's not much to write home about. Still the service is quick and friendly, and I was able to easily order with my limited French. My meal was well-sized for the price, and though rather bland, no complaints. Everything was hot and reasonably fresh."}
{"text":"Shawarma, pita and garlic sauce can not go wrong with some vegeatables.  Their hummus is alright, and service depends on who you get, some the friendliest in the world others seem to hate their job.  Stick with the Shawarma and it is a no fail."}
{"text":"Basha is great - but this time around I found the shawarma meat to be dry. I'll account it to be a busy lunch hour.   Love the roasted potatoes + garlic yogurt."}
{"text":"Decent food, they use real meat for their sandwiches (and not the Spam-looking meat of sorts), the salads are very good and always fresh..HOWEVER, they should train their females employees (who are clearly from the Middle East) to interact with male customers. Here in the West men and women do interact during business transactions held in public, in restaurants, supermarkets, shoe stores pharmacies, etc , if those female employees do not like doing that then they should not work behind a counter, because half of the customers will be men (problably some transexual customer will come, but it would difficult to find out and even more impolite to ask). So if Basha owners want to offer good customer service they should train their females employees according to the social mores of Canada (they are here anyway) . I have eaten twice at Basha, the first time in the Ste Catherine/Peel  location, the food was very good but the woman behind the counter behaved as if she hated her job or did not want to serve a male customer...then I ate at the food court on Place Mont Royal, the bald guy, who I suspect owns the franchise was friendly...the woman (probably his wife) reacted as though I had leprosy at the moment of giving me the change...if shes so disgusted with the presence of male customers she should be in the kitchen...problem solved."}
{"text":"Sorry Princess but its 4 stars all the way! I cook. I cook a lot of things. I cook middle eastern Cuisine and I highly enjoy eating middle eastern cuisine as well. I was made fun of for coming here, but I do have to say it was fairly decent for what it is. Back in the States where I live is a huge Arabic population, obvi the food here is fresher and what not but I do have to say Basha wasn't all that bad. I had their falafel which was pretty good, a shawarma, also delish and shared a plate of grape leaves which also were pretty good. Now, I think *my* grape leaves are the best, but these were also pretty good as well. I hate restaurants who take the oil soaked ones and pass them off as food, Basha, does not."}
{"text":"I am writing as a tourist with a hangover so you'll have to excuse me.  Anyways, I don't eat this type of food that often but in my opinion it was delicious.   I got the combo #4 which had beef,potato, salad, and a flat bread. Total came out to be 10 something. Overall you should try it."}
{"text":"No wait and much variety. The food is good. Hats off. It's very casual dining environment that's best to come in the afternoon when the food is made.  Nari Nari is always playing in the background which is a major plus."}
{"text":"Basha as a whole is just a terrible restaurant chain. They're like the low rent Amir... the crack-house of the Montreal shawarma scene. But unlike crack, it's impossible to get addicted because you derive zero pleasure from the experience.   There really aren't any details worth sharing. Just avoid this place if you can. Or stop by next time you're waiting for your skates to get sharpened at the adjoining Sports Experts."}
{"text":"Cafeteria style service with a great selection. Waited a few minutes  before my kabaabs were ready but was told it would take a few  minutes when I ordered.  My plate was over flowing with incredible selection of  meats, salad, veggies and rice with a generous amount of hummus.  Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Where should I begin? We ordered some food for delivery via alce.ca. We got falafel plate, shish tawook shawarma, mousaka, humus, and babaghanouj. They took 45 min to deliver and all the items were cold and the Ayran drink was so salty that it makes me cringe writing about it. Nothing special about this place. I should have taken the low reviews seriously."}
{"text":"Came here twice during a bachelor party weekend in Montreal.  The shawarma beef pita is what i got (twice) and it was very different.  Basically a bunch of different meats stuffed into a hummus pasted pita with veggies.  Super fresh and delicious.  I kinda miss it now..."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad shish taouk in Montreal, I feel like giving Basha only four stars because they give all of us Canucks plastics plates and automatically serve Middle Eastern terrorists with fancy china. But I haven't found a good shish taouk or shawarma in the USA since I relocated 7 yrs ago ( still looking ), so it gets a 5*."}
{"text":"It's junk food. It's a good way to take care of a garlic-shish taouk craving. Not the best Lebanese in town but it works. Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Wouldn't give me what I was asking for for no reason, they lost out on the money they would have made from me. Don't go there."}
