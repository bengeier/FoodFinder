{"text":"What an awesome experience, food was delicious and service excellent !! Pastrami , chicken and waffles fries all the food was homemade and so yummy! All the servers and host were friendly! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"A spontaneous trip to Metro Diner. My partner and I wanted pancakes so she yelped what was closest to us and this place came up.  The place has seating capacity of 91 so it's pretty big for a local breakfast joint. They also have seating outside.  I ordered the corned beef hash with poached eggs and my partner ordered Yo Hala on the square. My dish was good but I've had better. The Yo Hala is a different story, it was my first time trying something like it so I didn't have anything to compare it to. All I know is it was the bomb!!!  Jessica was our server and she was very attentive. We will definitely go back and try other stuff."}
{"text":"John A my server recommended the best chicken and waffles I have ever had.  The cajun backed fish and smothered chicken outstanding.  We will be be tomorrow."}
{"text":"Highly recommend having breakfast at Metro Diner.  I had been eyeing this diner for 3 different days while I was experiencing car troubles and had it at the Goodyear place across the parking lot.    Glad I took the chance and went it, excellent breakfast - highly recommend the San Francisco Eggs Benedict.  Here's a tip you'll thank me for - get the grilled onions on top of your hash browns.    Also, if you are lucky enough, you will get waited on by Chelsea.  She is extremely personable, knowledgeable and excels at making you feel welcome in this great feeling Diner.  You will not be disappointed by visiting this awesome establishment. I truly appreciated management stopping by my table to inquire on my visit as I was able to give feedback on my wonderful experience."}
{"text":"First time there. I ordered a BLT the Bacon was like rubber. The bread wad as hard as a rock. The waiter never checked back after dropping if the meal. The manager Javier was great. Offered to remake i didn't have the time to wait."}
{"text":"AWESOME~~best friend chicken & waffles on the west coast!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience from start to finish. One waitress asks for our drink order which was a coffee and OJ. She doubles back in a minute to ask if that was 2 OJ's and a coffee?  Then another server stops by to take our drink order? We're all set the other girl took our order (We hoped). I understand corporate stores but this training for new staff was horrible so far. Only 3 or 4 tables in entire store were occupied when we arrived early. We placed our food order and I watched as the QA (quality assurance) guy slash manager was trying to quarterback the room. His job is to read the orders placed under the heat lamp, ,make sure the right items are on the plates and call for runners to take food. My order was the 3 egg combo and it arrived with 2 eggs.......Not major problem yet but keep in mind these servers place orders on a tablet and don't have to even use memory to try and make it to the closest POS and enter everything like other places. Then you take into account that this place has a QA manager to double check cooks errors. I also noticed toast wasn't buttered. I asked for butter and why wasn't it buttered and the manager/QA guy says it is upon request only. Hmmmmm, why weren't we informed by server I asked to which he replied, they are supposed to. He took entire plate back to the kitchen instead of getting me butter or a new batch of buttered toast when I could have began to eat. In NY, that is illegal to take food away and bring it back, even to take leftovers home, they just bring you the box instead of walking your food around the restaurant. Training horrible from top to bottom. Will never be back nor refer to this place or the $4 Orange juice to anyone !!"}
{"text":"The food at Metro Diner was great.  We had the chicken and waffles.  The chicken was tasty and well seasoned.  The waffle was great too.  The service was amazing.  Ask to be seated in Finn's section.  She was attentive, made great suggestions and checked on us several times.  I will definitely ask for Finn the next time I'm in."}
{"text":"What's not to like?  Waffles  Strawberry butter Hash browns French vanilla coffee Chicken, Incredible The staff's humor & customer service is one of the reasons I will keep on coming back."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service.  We ate at the original location in JAX Florida earlier this year and enjoyed it.  Food at this location is just as good.  Unique home style meals."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the breakfast here but lunch food also looked awesome. Food was great, service was excellent, large portions and reasonable prices. Wait time wasn't bad at all 15 mins on a Sunday"}
{"text":"This was as good as it gets. I'm very picky when it comes to breakfast and comfort food and this place delivered. Shout out to having shredded hash browns and breakfast potatoes. The chicken and waffles were absolutely magical. I've been to the Lo-Lo's and the Roscoe's of the world and Metro Diner has taken the throne. The strawberry butter on top of the waffles was excellent. My mother got the Crab Cakes Eggs Benedict. We were skeptical, but my goodness, were those crab cakes impressive. Vacation in Maryland impressive. Service was excellent, great iced tea, can't wait to go back. We've found our new usual spot."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Came in on a Friday AM. We were seated right away. Our server was pleasant. Ordered 3-eggs w/ bacon, hash browns & toast. It was fluffy they give more than 1-bacon compared to other diners (that's a plus). Reuben sandwich to try; glad they'd serve it anytime, but it was ok according to my husband. I had 1/2 chicken waffles. Unfortunately the chicken was too salty! Temp hot with their syrup & regular Louisiana hot sauce. The service is excellent  They rectified bill error. Still 4 of 5 stars bec. of the great service & the staff constantly checking up on us we needed anything. I don't mind giving it another try ... next time I'll try the yo holla featured I think with Guy Fieri."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and love the beverage bar concept....you can have coffee while you wait,  which makes waiting to be seated  not so bad."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late breakfast on a cold morning with a group of five. Portions are large and quality of each item was excellent. The daily specials were all appealing and my wife especially liked the spicy chicken Benedict. I ordered the biscuits and gravy which were the best I have ever had. Our server was attentive and courteous making regular coffee/juice refills. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and every time I have the best service and best food. This is definitely one of the best places to enjoy breakfast in not only Henderson but Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Good old fashioned comfort food with HUGE portions.  Service was fast & friendly.  My new favorite place to eat!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time going to The Metro Diner and it was nice and cute inside. We picked our own booth in the back which was cool. Our waitress was alright, seemed like she was new. Our food was really good. I got the chicken pot pie which was way too hot to eat for like 30mins I ate what I could and took the rest home. My fianc√© got the San Francisco Benedict which was really good! It was his first time eating it and he was pretty happy with it especially not knowing what to expect. But definitely a rip off for a really small, not even a full cup of apple juice charged us $3. Overall it's a good place to go for breakfast, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Very impressive for the fact that they are only open 2 days. We were seated quickly despite them being full; very attentive service, drinks were refilled without asking and the food came out pretty quickly. As for their food - the fried chicken was remarkable - juicy and tasty and the coating was crunchy. 10 out of 10 would get  again. The rest of the food was yummy and satisfying. The tea had almost a fruit flavor to it. I liked it. The prices seemed good for a sit down restaurant especially for the large portion sizes. We took an entire dinner sized meal of left overs home - small eaters may want to consider sharing."}
{"text":"The breakfast is the best!. The crossiant French toast is great with strawberries and bananas!"}
{"text":"Spent a week in Las Vegas and found this great place to eat. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly and the food was delicious. Darla was fantastic! Loved the chicken and waffles. We will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great diner food.  Best corned beef hash in town. Great staff. Love breakfast all day."}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles ever!!!!!!! Meatloaf and pot pie were to die for as well! I will certainly be a regular here! Yum!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's better, the food or hospitality! Great selection. Great atmosphere. Great people. Delicious food. Easy, fun, and an all around enjoyable experience. A new favorite. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner ALL DAY. They also have daily specials for breakfast, entrees, and drinks."}
{"text":"I've eaten here half a dozen times so far, and every item that I've had here has been excellent, and the staff is super courteous."}
{"text":"Great food, we live in the neighborhood so glad we found Metro Dinner.  We will definitely be back.  Great place to catch a bite after work.  Fast service, reasonable price and taste like home."}
{"text":"Just left my first visit at Metro Diner.   I would say the people that helped us were pretty inexperienced. It was all slightly awkward.   Going to checkout we asked if they do a military discount and the waitress said I think we do let me check. Minutes went by and we were still waiting. We just ended up walking up to the front to get our check and she said I'm sorry she still hasn't done it but it's only like 10%. I said at least it's something and she continues to say that her manager is always up there bothering them to do stuff she can't believe that she isn't up there. After saying that she gave us the bill and said so it's going to be x amount. I was amazed.   I work costumer service and am a manager at my job. Never do we speak badly about our managers especially to our customers.   Also, the food wasn't all that good either. Nothing to rave about and the lack of urgency just killed it all.   I was hoping this would be my new go to restaurant but I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me to Metro Diner last night which is behind Carrabbas's on E. Independence in Matthews.  We sat at the counter and had a blast - the food & service were outstanding, huge portions and great prices.  They open every morning at 7 AM for breakfast and close at 8 PM during the week & 9 PM on weekends.  They have a location in Pineville and are opening a Huntersville location in October.  One of the guys behind the counter told me they have 63 locations across the country and were reviewed by Diner, Drive-ins & Dives in 2010 at their location in FL. Go try it and let me know what you think!!!"}
{"text":"Happened upon this place, wish I had not.  Wife's lunch sat under heat lamp for 5+ minutes while my fried fish was cooked.  Fish was soggy, tasteless and covered with a tasteless breading.  Fries were good. Expensive.  Better to stick to home grown diners than poor replicas from out of town ."}
{"text":"Good food, huge portions amazing service our server john A was excellent !! If your hungry this is the place."}
{"text":"You come somewhere and have phenomenal food and think it might be just an exceptionally good day, but THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!! It's clean, they're friendly, great prices, and the food is just beyond!! Short waits (less than 10 minutes) each visit, but there's a reason this place is busy!! Check it out!! The Shrimp and Grits are on point!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found this spot. I love comfort food and they have a lot of it!!! We ordered biscuits and gravy, and you could tell everything was super fresh. Also, ordered fried chicken strips with fries and Mac n cheese. So good!!! Really fair prices too. All around win!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.   First of all, the value is enormous. For $9.99, I got a meal that could feed three people. And the service was excellent.   Now compare this to toast down the street where I got a burrito with no side for $12.   Metro is going to make toast, well, toast! (good. toast is a ripoff, and the food is mediocre, at best).   If Metro stays consistent, it's going to be the best breakfast place in Huntersville."}
{"text":"We used to come here a lot but took a little break after we had a not so great experience. Service was on point for us, but I watched other servers walk around without noticing our empty water glasses and i even saw one server eat a French fry off of someone else's plate while delivering the food. We had a few issues and the bald male manager walked by our table multiple times and never stopped to see what was wrong but went to every other table around us. Needless to say, after three months away, we came back today. When we walked in, we were greeted by such a lovely woman who was incredibly kind. We saw Dana in the corner taking care of another table but we asked the woman if it was possible to sit with her since she was our go to server when we used to dine here. The woman looked at us and said that she was so happy to hear that because Dana was her daughter. We are so thrilled to be back and even more so now that we know not just Dana but her mother too. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great place to take the family and enjoy a great meal. I really enjoined the Chicken and Waffles. You will receive a whole half chicken and a great Belgian waffle. Make sure you try the Strawberry butter. The breakfast selections are great. The lunch menu is large. Enjoy the food!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am sitting here now. This is my third or fourth time. I love the pot pies and have only tried them so far because they are so delicious. I almost got up and left today, though, after being told to sit where I wanted, doing so, and then feeling invisible for 5 minutes while two other parties came in and got menus and drink orders before anyone came to my table. I'm sure it was just an oversight, but hopefully, the staff will work on noticing customers as they are seated. That said, my sweet tea is so good, and I'm looking forward to that first bite of yummy pot pie. So far,  all my servers have been great (once I got noticed)."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! Food is delicious , service is prompt and super friendly. Burgers are awesome and breakfast is delish. I crave their food the minute I leave!"}
{"text":"We moved from Jacksonville a year ago and were sad to not have our local favorites that we enjoyed there. Needless to say, we were thrilled when Metro Diner popped up on yelp one day. This place is just as good as the original. Some of our favs include shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles and the eggs crab Benedict. I am grateful that the secret is not out on this place yet - in Jax we always have to wait at least 45 minutes usually an hour to 1.5. We'll continue to take advantage. We know it won't be long before this is a local favorite."}
{"text":"We found this little diner on yelp. Their Montecristo was amazing! Definitely recommend it. And the portion size was big enough for two meals. This place is a cute little diner with friendly fast service. They also offer military discount of 10% which made lunch even better."}
{"text":"I have been to the Metro twice, first time with my husband, we both had a bowl of soup...tomato bisque for me and potato soup for my husband. DELICIOUS!  If we were home my husband would have licked the bowl clean.  We then had grilled cheese sandwiches which were delicious and cooked just right.   My second visit was breakfast with the girls, food came out hot, portions were plentiful and we all took home what we couldn't finish.  Both times we were served by Tina, she took great care of us.....ask for her, you won't be sorry.   The manager came over both visits to ask if all was well......  Keep up the good work Metro Diner.....hope to be back soon.....my only complaint is you are a bit far from us!"}
{"text":"One our favorite diners now! The food is great and the staff is friendly and top notch!"}
{"text":"I would give Metro Diner a 4-star review because I am generally a fan of the food there; however, there have been some problems with consistency recently. I don't know if management looks at the reviews and corrects issues, but there are some people working there that I can only assume don't care. On one recent experience as I was taking the utensils out of the paper bag, a wad of paper fell out. Then when I pulled the utensils out of the bag, there was a rather large piece of paper - likely napkin material (about 3/4\" x 1-1/2\") that was \"glued\" to the knife inside the bag. I assume that a human is putting the utensils in the bags after washing them, not a robot. If a human is stuffing the utensil bags, clearly the person doesn't care about what they are doing as the foreign material was very easy to see. My wife ordered breakfast and the toast was badly burned - completely black crust and flat sides. The hash browns are usually very good - nice and golden on the outside and just cooked through on the inside. On a prior visit they were overcooked to the point of being blackened on the outside and very hard all the way through. I doubt any of these incidents are up to the standards of Metro Diner, but it looks like no one is paying attention. It's hard to believe any restaurant would send such obviously burned food out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"My family was here for breakfast on Sunday morning. Our service was fine and my crab cake Benedict was very good. My wife had the avocado toast. She not being the one to complain asked me to try some of the avocado, and when I did it was like eatting a spoon full of salt.  She only ate one half slice of the total 4 slices. That would be the only thing negative about our first visit. We will go back, but will avoid the avocado toast."}
{"text":"We had the white fish sandwich and cheeseburger with mac and cheese.  Big portions and was surprised at the size of the fish, the plate wasn't big enough.  We'll be going back here for sure.  I want try the fried chicken and waffles.   Excellent service!"}
{"text":"30 minute wait, friendly staff and all the food I saw come out of the kitchen looked good. Not many vegetarian options so I had grilled cheese and hubby had chicken and waffles. Fries were hard/old but the chicken was marinated 48 hours so it was juicy and crispy. Waffles with strawberry butter very good."}
{"text":"Good food , but bad service, just my guy maybe. After asking for my first drink refill , I never received it or saw him again till he brought the check when I was finished with my meal . They seem in a hurry to take your order & get your food to you & then that's it . He never asked how was everything or did I need anything. After getting the bill , $ 13.78 before tax , I planned on tipping $3. Paid with a 20 , waited for my change . He brings back a 5 & walks away . Any waiter that expects a tip knows to break up bills so that someone can leave a 20% tip . But I guess he knew what he was doing , while waiting for him to come back by to break 5 , he disappeared again , not having all day to wait on him again , he got the whole 5 , but I won't be back"}
{"text":"We had a great meal and service for lunch today. Fin was our server and she was fantastic. She was very friendly and attentive. I will definitely ask for her next time! I had the Shrimp and Grits and while they were different than I have had at other restaurants they were flavorful and worth ordering."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but I've given it 3 chances and I think I'm about done. I definitely recommend you check it out, your experience might be different.   First time I went it in, service was great for a party of two. The waitress was friendly, explained all the specials, and was attentive. They were pretty busy which probably led to confusion. We ordered our food and shortly after we were brought someone else's food. When we told the waiter it wasn't ours he looked a bit annoyed and confused. The customers behind us told him it was their food. Not a big deal, it was busy. Eventually our food came out but the orders were wrong and had to send them back. The manager was very nice and apologized. Didn't think much of it because it was busy.  We came back a second time, they were busy again but we were sat down within minutes. This time we were sat at a table that had just been cleaned, but the seats and table were still wet. We asked for napkins to wipe down the excess water but no one came back with napkins. I took napkins from the table nearby ( I know not cool) and when the waiter saw me cleaning he didn't say anything. We instead got a different waitress. She was nice and friendly as well. Food came out and it was the wrong  order again. I felt bad sending it back but we were both missing/had wrong items. Manager came over and apologized.  Last and final try. Wasn't greeted, someone just told us to pick a seat. Took a while for someone to come over to our table, no napkins, no silver ware. They weren't that busy, it was a Friday around mid morning. We finally got service but weren't told about specials, waitress seemed a little impatient to take our order. We didn't get refills on coffee or water; when I asked the waitress for silverware she seemed bothered and didn't give us napkins. My eggs were very runny and had to send them back.   The food is what you expect diner food to be: big plates and satisfies that diner food craving. I was hoping this would be my breakfast spot but hey it's vegas and there are plenty of other options. Happy dining to you all!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners,Drive-Ins and Dives. Gave it a try and gave something a try that wasn't on a \"Special Menu\". I was beyond amazed by the non-greasy croissant French Toast and topped it with fresh strawberries & granola. The server recommended the strawberry butter and boy the flavors just exploded! I loved my plate so much that I ate the whole thing! Lol! A lot of the servers even stopped by our table to complement on the concoction I ordered and a few of them also said \"I'm gonna have to try that\" and \"I would have never thought to make that and it looks so delicious\".  My husband ordered the house chicken and waffles. Boy that chicken was so tasty and full of flavor. Served really piping hot (so be careful). The server explains that it comes with spicy syrup and they come table side service to mix it in front of you (maple syrup with 7 drops or so) of hot sauce. Now that's a full of umami explosion party in the mouth!  The host and servers were very friendly. Except for that one girl that worked the front while we were on our way out. One guy acknowledged us for \"how was everything\" \"have a great day\".  Then there was this one girl that just thinks great customer service doesn't leave a good impression once the customer leaves.  I overheard her commenting to her co-workers \"you all sound like a broken record.\" This girl was the same one that didn't even acknowledge us or even say good morning when we walked into the door. Sorry but not sorry...this girl being stationed as a host should not be in the front where the first and last customer interaction is at. All in all the majority of the friendly staff outweighed this one girl.  Thank you Guy Fieri and Metro Diner!!!! We'll be back again."}
{"text":"On our first visit last week, we loved it. Came back today and ordered the same thing and it wasn't close to the same quality or taste. First, the French Vanilla coffee had an odd taste. They got us new cups and it tasted the same. We kept it, but it had a watered down odd taste, unlike last visit where it was very good. Secondly, my husband asked for his eggs over medium and they were served over hard. The manager came to check on us and we explained that he ordered his eggs over medium etc. He said he would get him some new over medium eggs, no problem. He returned with sunny side up eggs. We just said thank you, kinda shocked he didn't know the difference. Everyone was friendly, not the same vibe as our first visit though. We are just disappointed that the experience was so different than our first visit. We both ordered the huevos rancheros and it was a totally different presentation and flavor."}
{"text":"This place was freakin awesome! It was my first time here and knew a bit of what to expect because of the other reviews, but coming in person and knowing by first hand experience really launched my expectation level. Had the chicken and waffles and made me wonder how the hell they made the chicken so nice and tender. I was kind of hesitant of the waffles with the strawberry butter cuz im not a fan of sweetness, but it actually perfect. The hazelnut coffee and their sweet peach tea was really good too. I love the fact that we can take drinks to go! Especially cuz the peach was awesome to my taste buds! The servers were on point too. They were very nice and  really helped us out. I will be there again to try a sandwich for sure! Thank you Metro Diner and we will see you soon"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times for breakfast. Last time I had the Yohala French toast, which was great, recommended by our server Adrienne, also great. Boyfriend likes the Frisco Breakfast sandwich. Nice change from the usual selection of restaurants on the west side of town. Not too big inside so nice cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dining here with the wife on the morning of 4/22/17...The service was top notch Nick certainly had the right attitude for the job and everyone else was friendly and helpful...The wife had the chicken and waffles which she said was amazing and i can say the same havibg tried hers....I had the Big Berns pork tenderloin sandwhich with fries.. I did sub raw onion for grilled as i do not care for grilled onion...this sandwhich was delicious the tenderloin was thick and moist and the fries were great and not over cooked like seems to be the norm these days....asked for and received ranch dressing for the fries..the ranch is fresh made not out of a bottle...overall everthing was great and we look forward to many more visits to the Metro Diner"}
{"text":"We frequent all the nearby breakfast places in the southwest and we were very pleasantly surprised. The little things were very well done; fancy jam, silk pouch tea, chilled creamer and hazelnut coffee really rounded out a good experience. However, it was when they delivered the check, noticed my father in laws WW2 veterans cap and then re-rung the bill to give us a serviceman discount and thanked him for his service that made a loyal customer out of us. Thank you, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Haven't even gotten my food yet and already a 5 star. Great service, music, menu. Self serve beverage bar is out of this world! Update: food was phenomenal. We will be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"We heard a lot of things about this diner before finally stopping in yesterday for lunch.they were moderately busy and our waitress seemed a little behind. She asked us to hold on a second politely a few times before finally taking our order. She seemed knowledgeable of the menu items since we had a lot of questions. The cook came pretty quick and everything was delicious. Can't wait to come back for breakfast"}
{"text":"Great food.  I've never tasted such a good Eggs Benedict.  I did the sandi beach one. And service was quick. And lots of Windows. Nice and bright!"}
{"text":"Just the first try.  A big steak egg and cheese omelet with fruit.  Met the manager and chatted with staff.  Extremely hopping atmosphere.  Definitely return."}
{"text":"Our first time and definitely not our last, Our waiter was amazing and the food was incredible!  Our kids had the pigs in a blanket, my husband had biscuits and gravy, and I had the chicken and waffles.   Everything was delicious! Definitely would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"First visit, many to come!!  The staff is great, the fried chicken is stellar..seriously delicious!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried the Metro Diner for the first time this weekend.  The service was great, the food is more comfort style food and was very good.  I had a huevos rancheros where i ordered the eggs poached hard.  And guess what...they listened!  Kudos to you guys!  Our waiter's personality was an excellent fit to his position.  He made us feel right at home.  The staff has a good time working together.  I am told to be on the lookout for key lime pie.  It has a reputation of being excellent.  We will be back.  Phil V"}
{"text":"Came to Metro Diner for a quick brunch and I have to say that not only was the staff extremely courteous but the food was everything I had read and more.  The meal came out in a short amount of time and was delicious. Shelly, our waitress did an awesome job of checking on us before,during and after the meal."}
{"text":"No wait on Easter Sunday brunch time! Very friendly staff.  Plenty of parking (found in same shopping center as USPS, Walmart, Chilis on 51 Pineville).  Overall, we had a great experience and I'd go back again.  But - I got a reuben, which was DRENCHED in 1000 Island dressing.  The sandwich was falling apart from being over saturated, so I scraped a bunch off and it was much more edible once I get rid of the mound of dressing.  Plenty of corned beef, light on the cheese and sauerkraut though. I had coleslaw as my side and it was surprisingly not as moist as I expect coleslaws to be.  It was flavored nicely, but I did expect the same amount of liquid excess that I didn't want on my sandwich.  It was a little odd for me.  I tried the hash browns, which needed salt and had a great crust, but the inside was much too tender for my liking.  The rest of the meal was uneventful.  We had a very efficient and friendly server and I would go back.  There were quite a few yummy looking breakfast items I think I'll try instead next time."}
{"text":"I've been twice now, once for lunch rush and once for dinner. Both times there was about a 5 minutes wait to be seated but the service was prompt and the food came out hot and right. I did breakfast for lunch and their omletes are HUGE! Sweet tea was fresh which is a big plus in my book. Dinner I have the salmon special and it was amazing! Also, the soups are scratch made on the premises... honestly the BEST potato soup I've ever had in a restaurant. My husband always tries the country fried steak and he said theirs is the best in Charlotte. We will be repeat customers for sure!"}
{"text":"Looking to try everything on this menu!!!! The service was a 10 also. The manager was very attentive and checked on us and asked about the food.  We will be back, I think there is a second location, so we might check that one our also.  I had the chicken and waffles. They were fantastic.. Thanks metro!!!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Excellent food, especially liked the chicken and waffles. They also give a military discount"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this new place and it was absolutely amazing. The service was first class from the moment we walked in the door and our server, Jocelyn, is second to none! Then the food was flavorful! My wife had the chicken tender (?) salad and I had the chicken and waffles. The strawberry butter on the waffles and the hot syrup with a hint of Louisiana hot sauce for the chicken--oh my!!! The food is very plentiful, you probably will not be able to finish your dinner!"}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles are amazing! Everything else I've had here is also fantastic."}
{"text":"Such a cute 'small town feel' restaurant. The staff was so friendly and their food was great. I saw people there on lunch break and also sitting with laptops getting stuff done. Very laid back feel. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and had high expectations but were disappointed.   The hash browns had a chemical flavor to them,  all of the food came out of the kitchen luke warm at best.  The sausage gravy was tasteless.   Really disappointing meal."}
{"text":"I hate to write this review, but the other day I ordered oatmeal and I was very disappointed. I paid $5.95 for a bowl of runny oatmeal and the amount of oatmeal wasn't enough for a 10 year old. One of my favorite places is sadly losing it's status and I will start going to other places. Also I told the manager and they didn't even give me a discount or remove it from my bill."}
{"text":"Lackluster Lunch Experience.  Got the shrimp Po' Boy sandwich and fries.  The shrimp wasn't well seasoned and the fries were pretty bland. There was generally nothing amazing/really tasty about our lunches (went with 2 coworkers). Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food and service! We ordered their shrimp and grits, chicken and waffle , meatloaf and gravy they were delicious! Definitely going back here next time we visit ."}
{"text":"Really good food, nice decor, and excellent service. I had the chef salad, which was huge and delicious. My husband got the turkey plate, which he loved. Can't wait to go back and try the breakfast options as well."}
{"text":"I lived in San Marco Florida where the original Metro Diner started. I frequently went there for breakfast. Then I moved to Jacksonville Beach and ate at the Metro Diner on the Beach. I was very excited to find out that Metro opened up here in Vegas. I ordered biscuits and gravy with a side order of cheesiest grits. Although I enjoyed the biscuits and gravy, very generous portion. The grits had no flavor at all! I think the team needs to be retrained on preparing grits. I love good grits and coming from Florida I wasn't expecting them to be really good, but these were tasteless. I will try other items on the menu, I really want this place to do well. Being from J'ville it is nice to have a place from home. The staff was very friendly and very helpful! I will go back, but please learn how to make some good southern grits!"}
{"text":"My second visit. First was for dinner, had the special \"Stuffing\" waffle with Turkey, Mashed Potatoes, and gravy.  It was fantastic.  Portions were large.   Today, I'm here for breakfast and went with a traditional 3 egg breakfast with hash browns, bacon, and toast. Again the food was fantastic. Great service, great atmosphere, and very good food.  I will be back to try some traditional lunch dinner fare.   After 2 visits, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of partaking in the soft opening. The restaurant was clean and well situated. Our waitress, Chastity, did an excellent job and was friendly. She knew the menu very well and was attentive. Having ordered from all sections of the menu, all the food came out quickly, together and warm. My Blackened Shrimp was delicious. Waffles, grilled cheese and chicken tenders were delicious as well. Chicken tenders were real chicken and the breading  was perfect. The restaurant was a little noisy, that was expected as they were very busy and it is a diner. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Our experience was very good here. Our server was excellent because the food was served fast and our drinks kept filled. Everyone in our group enjoyed their food. I ordered the Biscuits and gravy with eggs over hard, hash browns cooked well and a side of Cheesy Grits. The gravy was fantastic, however the biscuits were hard underneath, which is why they got 4 instead of 5 stars. The cook should of not let hard biscuits go out and make sure they stay fresh. Other than that, everything I ordered was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Really good food. I was expecting a stand alone \"diner \" yet it was within the business center with plenty other establishments.  They wait was about 15mins but I lucked up and got a couple spots at the bar. Our waitress was very welcoming and friendly and made great suggestions.  They proclaimed to have the best C&W in the city. Lol I've honestly have had better but the portions were large and the food was fresh, hot and well seasoned. The Charleston style shrimp and grits were really good as well. I would defiantly recommend this place and I'm sure I will go back again soon."}
{"text":"We come here almost weekly. Have not had a bad meal yet. You get a lot of food for you dollar and it's so delicious! Love the chicken and waffles.  Our favorite is the Bissell Breakfast combo. It comes with Two eggs any style, bacon, toast, hasbrowns or grits, and a short stack of pancakes. We love to get it with home fries. For lunch we tend to get burgers. Quality beef and great seasoning. We are huge fans of Metro! Anytime company comes over we take them to Metro! Never a disappointment ! The the customer service is superb. Very friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"We don't live on this side of town but had an appointment nearby. Upon looking for a place to have breakfast we found Metro Diner. We were extremely happy that we found this place. Their chicken and waffles are out of this world! We also ordered an omelette, biscuits and gravy and their loaded hashbrowns. Oh my goodness everything was so delicious! Really glad we found this place. If you haven't been here yet I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Very good diner. Everyone was very friendly and the service was very quick. I had huevos rancheros and for the most part it tasted really good. There was too many black beans but again the flavor was good. I would probably have used green chiles instead of jalape√±os. Eggs were cooked perfectly. I will definitely come come back."}
{"text":"I really loved this diner! I got the meatloaf and it was to die for. The staff is also super friendly. We actually left and were in the car ready to go home when a waiter chased us down to return a hat that we left at the table! This is a very laid back restaurant, don't feel bad about going in jeans and a t-shirt! Food is delicious, would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is some satisfying home cooking?  food..The spicy chicken biscuit is amazing!!! And I love the self serve drink bar.."}
{"text":"Oh, dear lord....this is what we have been waiting for!  An adorable place with a free DIY coffee bar while you wait! They served French toast that must have had 2 cups of blueberries on top. It was so large that my bottomless teenage son ate it for 2 meals. The burger was a half pound and then had a mound of stuff on top! The meatloaf was excellent, the hot turkey plate was bliss but....THE BACON. IT MUST BE ILLEGAL. This stuff has a texture I've never had before. It's thin, which usually isn't good, and its crispy, which I hate, but it shatters like that fine sugar crust on a creme br√ªl√©e. It's stunningly good - so good that we encouraged the table next to us to order it and they thanked us when we left.  The wait can be long during the after-church hours but they serve breakfast all day. It's old school but brand new and has the best of everything. It's what great diner food should be, which is the hardest thing of all: huge menu options and it all has to be excellent. They succeed."}
{"text":"The team wrk here tonight is awesome!!  Everyone is friendly and the food is great!!  This will be great place to return for any meal!"}
{"text":"3 Stars. Unlikely other eating places where one finds some items  way overpriced, some priced right, and some are bargains, the owners of Metro Diner have priced NO ITEMS as an overpriced pick, or a bargain either. IMO ALL ITEMS are close to or right on the mark as to what Las Vegas diners will tolerate. That said, it comes down to selections and the taste of those lections. Here too, Metro Diner rates a middle of the road rating IMO. A little bit salty and average flavor. Inferior places, but not by much, IMO, are Black Bear Diner and IHOP. Superior places, but not by much, IMO are Village Pub and most Strip Buffets."}
{"text":"First time here. Got a breakfast special similar to a grand slam with French toast. Massive portions and taste like home cooked breakfast. Service was awesome too! Dario our server was great!"}
{"text":"I had the fortunate pleasure to live in Jax, FL and visit the original location...other than the building...you wouldn't know the difference. The food as always was TOP notch!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed every bit of the meal & the atmosphere was nice also, will definitely return. I was told by my friends that I did good on the pick. Gplum"}
{"text":"Welcoming staff, great menu selection, and delicious food. Went for my youngest 21st birthday and we all enjoyed Mimosa's. This is now one of my top restaurants!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably good food. Quick and friendly service. Priced right with enough left over to take home a to-go box. My new favorite restaurant in the Ville!"}
{"text":"I don't usually do this, yet I felt compelled to. I visited Metro Dinner in Matthews on December 29th, 2017. My server was A very kind lady named Candace. I must say that she was on her job, then another server we later found out his name was Mark. It was nice to see them working in tandem, very pleasant and I will be bringing my family back. I felt like the only guest she had. The food has always been wonderful, but my service has never been so warm before. They are an asset, and as a local restaurant owner, and a diner regular you've done an outstanding job. I tipped them both, watched them, and there sense of urgency made us feel important. I also watched her help others and keep a smile on her face. Those two work well together and your manager that was on her job. A nice blonde headed lady came and spoke to us, first time ever at that location. The winds of change are upon you. I have found that the food at places can be so/ so, but if the service is good we always go back. We went in for breakfast today, again stellar, but the service was not what I had last night. We will come back, we just know who to ask for next time, so anyone using Yelp, go to Metro in Matthews and ask for Candace and or Mark. I never laughed so much, and even my husband tipped better than I have ever seen him do before. So give this place a shot, the food is to die for and the portions are huge. Nothing better than homemade food, fresh flavored coffee and she talked us in a piece of chocolate cake with milk. If there were more than 5 stars, I'd give them to you.  Signed Very happy Diner!!!"}
{"text":"Much better places in Matthews to eat. Service is bad. On one occasion we sat 15 before we even got greeted by our server. That same night a table left as their server never came either. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is great! First of all we had an amazing waitress named Ida that I would definitely ask for again! She was attentive and knew the menu well.  I went with the Pittsburgh steak salad and it was delicious. The steak was tender and tasty and the French fries went so well with the salad. I personally would have preferred some other type of lettuce other than  iceberg, but no complaints with how it came. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was better! John A. was great and it made the whole experience better. The owner was there and stopped by to ask about our food and service.  I will be returning soon and telling all my friends!"}
{"text":"The good - good food, fresh ingredients (ex. hand chopped potatoes for home fries, fresh jalape√±os) , great portions, nice job on the interior remodel - can' t even tell it was an Italian restaurant before at all!   The not so good - freezing inside and a bit pricey for breakfast. Waited 15 minutes for one of three tables outside. $10 for a BLT. Wait staff also seem to still coming up to speed on the job on prior visit, but much better second visit. Pleasant service from Ashley.  Can't wait for remaining kinks to be worked out and happy to have in Matthews."}
{"text":"Man... I truly wanted to like this place. It's so close to my home.  Arrived for breakfast, around 8:30a. There was hardly no one in the diner. The place was so cold, my husband and I almost turn around and left.   Place was clean..wait staff was ok. Couldn't believe we waited 40min for two egg sandwiches which was just meh!! I hope this place gets better. It's so close to home!"}
{"text":"Great place for a down home, tasty breakfast. Extremely friendly staff and the house was packed on this Sunday morning so we sat at the counter and watched the action in the kitchen.   I had the croissant French toast and it was fabulous! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We attended the pre-opening Boys Town  fundraiser at the newest location; it was terrific!  The staff was friendly, helpful, knowledgeable.  The missing star was for room noise.    We had a group of 6 and fit easily into a booth, so very family friendly.  I ordered Charleston Shrimp and Grits and they thought there were no more grit cakes so they asked if I would like a substitution.  I ordered regular grits and the dish was delicious.  Halfway through the manager came with another full order, stating that they made new grit cakes for me - amazing service, memory and thoughtfulness!    We had the worst shrimp and grits ever at Eat earlier that day - I couldn't eat more than one bite, and the Metro Diner shrimp and grits were one of the best I've had.  The rest of the party loved their meals - meatloaf was like mom made, Cajun chicken pasta, blackened shrimp with black beans, etc.  Tomato bisque - yum!   Best of skill on the new location and continued growth - we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love diners more than anything and this place doesn't disappoint. It's very clean, has a friendly, efficient staff with great attitudes! April was my server today and she was a delight. The food is delicious and the portions are generous. I highly recommend this place for fantastic comfort food."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this place is AWESOME!!! Great atmosphere and an amazing mix of of staff! I asked if I could sub my favorite set of specialty pancakes for my short stack, and it wasn't something they ever been asked. The boss heard my request, and said, \" What do we say Here\" and the server (Kiki ) said, \" We can fulfill your request\" with a smile! \" . This experience has been great! Please ask for Kiki! She will go to the Moon and Back for you!! As I'm writing this, I just received on the house Clam Chowder!!! Everybody come to this place!!!!! P.S. look out for Dakota, he is the hardest working table Buster I've ever laid eyes on!  I love this place!"}
{"text":"I walked in at 7:45 pm or so and the place had a good number of people in it.  I didn't realize that they closed so early (8:00 pm Sunday - Thursday) until after I ate and walked out the door.  Makes perfect sense though, looking back at the body language and cues from the staff. It seemed like they were hoping we'd leave and not order anything, as it took a fairly long time for someone to come over.   Our server was nice and smiley (pretty much the only one there that was) but it was clear what was up when we took our first bite and our bill came.  They also ended up seating a family of 5 with a baby well after us so I'm not sure what the rushing was all about.  I also never got that water refill...  My rueben was just ok. It had bits of hard boiled egg and pickle relish in it.  That is fairly odd and not even listed on the menu like that.  I haven't ever seen those in a rueben and hopefully never will again.  (Edit-big bits, more like chunks of egg whites and yolk.  Not very appetizing and the whites were sort of chewy. I know there are lots of recipes for dressing but I will still stand by my opinion of it not being typical to have chunks of egg on a rueben.) The salisbury steak was good though.   This was actually my 2nd visit but there is definitely an \"off vibe\" at this place.  The first time I got a chicken salad sandwich and tomato bisque.  Some of the chicken was big, dry and chewy and the soup was too much like jarred pasta sauce.    It probably would have been better if they did turn us away this time.  Two strikes is enough for me.  I doubt I will ever be back."}
{"text":"I have heard about Metro Diner for a few months, and finally decided to give it a try. Sunday morning was very busy, but we didn't wait very long. Our server Jc greeted us very quickly with a glass of water and told us about the specials of the day. She also shared her favorite things on the menu and answered every question we had this being our first time here. We tried the Chicken and waffles- which Jc recommended. It was sooooooo good. That strawberry butter is like ice cream! My husband had the biscuits and gravy. The sausage gravy had a great amount of sausage and very flavorful. The service and food get 5 stars. Can't wait to come back and try something new."}
{"text":"So my first time coming to this place, I came at night with two of my friends. And while I'm usually one who is quick to decide on what I'd like to order, my friends had a lot of questions. Our server at the time was Dario, and he was very, VERY helpful with every question my friends threw at him. Took about 10 minutes for our food to get to us; overall, it was a great, first-time experience. Zero complaints.  My second time coming to this place, I came in the afternoon and had Monique as my server. I came by myself this time, so getting my order placed went through quickly because like I said, I'm very fast on deciding what to order. It was also really busy at the time; every table was taken and there were people literally standing outside as they were waiting because of how packed it was. But surprisingly, my order didn't even take 10 minutes to make it to me.  Both Dario and Monique were very friendly servers; they definitely gave me a welcoming kind of vibe. Big shoutout to the two of them :)"}
{"text":"Great price, even better food.  Went there for the first time recently and the service was great.  I had sausage gravy with poached eggs over biscuits and it was amazing.  We will definitely be going back to this awesome gem."}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Manager/owner is very friendly.  I sat at the bar and watched the \"well oiled\" process come together.  Everything that was cooked looked great. The food was  great. They have a vast menu for breakfast lunch and dinner. The staff seem to enjoy their jobs.  I had the 2 stack of panckes, hashbrowns, scrambled eggs and sausage.  It is a nice little find on Pineville Matthews.   Charlotte is in need of great breakfast places...and this one provides it all. Also, breakfast is available all day!!!"}
{"text":"This was their Apple dessert!! It was huge!!! And yummy!!! Our lunch group tried this establishment out on Tuesday, I'm pretty sure everyone liked what they ordered. There were some pot pies, ooooooh the chicken in them were such big pieces and tendeeeeerrrr!! The meatloaf and veggies were WONDERFUL !!!  The grilled cheese was a favorite. The service was very exceptional, great attention to the drinks and really genuinely nice ladies!! See ya soon!!"}
{"text":"My first time here, and I will definitely be back. I highly recommend chicken and waffles. It was delicious.. at first I thought 16$ was a bit much, but once my food got there and I seen how much chicken and waffles I got . 16$ is just fine .  The chicken was delicious. The staff was very welcoming and accommodating.  They even came by to let us know it was still cooking just so we are not wondering why it's taking a while. Which is great and I prefer my food to take a while then to come fast. Cause usually that means it's not fresh..  Check out this place when you get a chance, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast and lunch place conveniently located near my home.  Metro started in Jacksonville, Fl (my hometown) and I frequented Metro Diner each and every time I travel back East.  They seem to have a simple philosophy - good food and good service.  And fast.  The portions are sizable and delicious.  One of my go to faves is their take on Huevos Rancheros, a dish which most places just can't seem to get right.  Metro's version is full of flavors, but none overwhelm the rest, and the presentation is spot on.  Very friendly staff and management is very visible.  Kudos to Shannon - she is simply a service rock star!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for quantity, this place is for you. They give you lots of food and the service is good. The quality, not so good: i had the biscuits and gravy with eggs and hash browns. The eggs, hash browns and biscuits were average to good diner food. The gravy was bland, like they made a country gravy and added cooked sausage to it. Although there was lots of sausage, the predominant flavors were milk and flour. I know it's healthier, but without sausage grease, it lost its flavor.   My wife had the San Francisco Benedict. Again, the English muffin, the egg, the Canadian bacon and avocado all average to good diner food. The Hollandaise sauce was seriously disappointing, lacking a decent lemon flavor, with an off color. I don't expect most restaurants to make a true Hollandaise, especially at these prices, but they can do better than an off colored, oil flavored substitute."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, huge portions.  Ate on the patio, which even being enclosed and having heaters was a bit chilly.  Was with  a large party, everyone got something different.  Everything was a big hit.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The customer service is A+ I sat at the bar because my date was starving. Watching the staff make the food and being able to ask questions about which items looked good was a huge plus. I'm already planning my next visit and I live 6 hours away"}
{"text":"The breakfast pie was delicious. It was very flavorful and filing. The croissant breakfast sandwich looked amazing as well. The mimosas are strong so be careful. The staff is very friendly. Overall, a must come place and great value."}
{"text":"such great reviews so we decided to try ( my wife & i )  what a mistake! how this diner got  89 reviews with such high marks 4.5 stars ( please) first my wife calls and asked for a chicken dinner she received a confused employee  who couldn't abswer a simple question about how many pieces of chicken u get ( come on really? ) she got another person who answered & placed our order , we picked it up went home and opened it was wrong!! ( surprise) only a two piece for dinner ( really? so we eat our dinner/ lunch & my wife called again ro speak to the manager ( she apologized u stated ) i guess retraining is needed ( duh yeah')so she stated she would \" send out coupons for free dinners right away) that was two weeks ago !! so very done we will never grace there doors again!! ( chicken was tasteless as well) lots of hot sauce needed.SO today Thursday Nov 16th my wife & i decided try metro diner again ( compliments of the owner Tony ) in order to try the Fried Chicken again , which this time we found to be AMAZING such great flavor ( JOHN A.) was our server we went early 4pm ,John was as AMAZING as the food ( great serves )friendly smile & very knowledgeable about his job.We found our second visit to be perfect ( compared to first) we will visit many more time again,and hopefully raise MD to 5 stars."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. Amazing food and even better service!! Be careful, portion sizes are huge! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Came into town for a few days away with my wife and we were looking for somewhere to eat. We are not Las Vegas strip type of people and we're hoping to find something more low-key. This place was delicious. Clean, with a lot of help. Our server was John A and he was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. Definitely seemed as though he had tried everything and was speaking from experience.   I ordered one of their blackboard specials, a stuffing waffle covered in mashed potatoes, turkey, and gravy. It was really good and humongous. My wife had the Monte cristo, which was deep fried and delicious.   I don't think I've been to a restaurant with such happy and nice staff before. They were all going over the top to make sure we were doing well. It was almost a little too much for my taste, but I can't fault them for that.    It's a solid place. You can tell they care. The menu is inventive. I would definitely go back.   Also, I would say it is very family friendly as well. We didn't have our 2 year old son with us, but it was absolutely a place I would feel comfortable with him."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast early on a Sunday morning (about 8:30). We were seated right away. Service was great and the food was outstanding. I had the Frisco breakfast sandwich and it was fantastic. My only recommendation for them would be to offer regular breakfast tea (or even just simple Lipton or Tetley). The only hot tea options they had were Earl Grey and Chamomile. But that was a very minor thing in a great experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to dine here. We come here a lot for breakfast. Big Mahalo to John A. for being such an amazing server."}
{"text":"Server was unbelievably nice and the fish and chips were nicely breaded but that can't outweigh the long nasty hair that was on the bottom of my plate.  The manager was very nice and comped me but a hair is still a hair.   Came back to give them another shot and I am glad I did because the meatloaf was great"}
{"text":"Dakotah is an awesome server! He knew everything on the menu and really sold us on the chicken and waffles. Definitely check him out, this place and great and he made it even better."}
{"text":"Second timer. This location is new so my husband and I went for dinner and it was so good we decided to go the next day for breakfast.  I had the croissant french toast which was delicious! He had the Sandi Beaches Benedict which I tasted and it was very good as well. We will definitely be back. Staff is really nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a hearty breakfast cooked to my liking at a reasonable price. Our waitress was spot on with the coffee refills and big smiles. Metro offers the lunch menu at breakfast time as well, so maybe I'll venture a Minorcan clam chowder on my next visit."}
{"text":"It's good food for a chain diner. The portions are way to large for one person. The child menu portions can feed one adult and child. If you're in the mood for comfort, it a great place to fill that craving."}
{"text":"They changed the menu and I'm so upset! The only place I knew of that had a (delicious) monte cristo sandwich. I ask about it every time I come in and am disappointed."}
{"text":"been meaning to check this place out and glad i finally did.  upon waking in it has a very old school look.  i ordered the chicken & waffles.  the server kelly recommended the mango iced it which was tasty.  the food came out fast which is a huge plus.  lots of chicken 5 pcs and 4 waffles with powered sugar and strawberry butter?  chicken was hot, fresh and juicy.  the waffles were also delicious.  i'm a skinny guy but i have my fat kid moments and almost ate everything.  the staff was extremely nice.  one of the cooks recommended the stuffed french toast and biscuits and gravy.  i recommend this place if you wanna cheat on your diet and live a little."}
{"text":"The Metro Dinner is a must try. The portions are great for the price. The staff is super friendly. The atmosphere is that of a modern diner. They serve everything on the menu.anytime of day.  The breakfast is the best so far, they have shrimp and grits prepared the Southern way. Their chicken and waffles consist of a half fried chriken, crispy, and a waffle with strawberry butter. The veggie omelette is filled with mushrooms, asperegus, cheese and tomatoes. I really enjoyed the.eating experience."}
{"text":"One of the best chicken and waffles they give you a lot plus the strawberry butter is of the hook and great service today highly recommended"}
{"text":"The food and staff are beyond AMAZING!  Portions are too huge. I recommend sharing a meal for sure. We have been twice, would go more often if the prices weren't so high and the music is pretty loud. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken & wafflles twice, both times it was over cooked, also very pricey over $15....then $4 for a glass of apple juice.... geez. Thanks for the response, I'll definitely try you again, the menu selections did look awesome, and the location is great!....also friendly Host."}
{"text":"We dined here for breakfast and ordered the Halla bread French toast, eggs Benedict and a simple bacon/eggs breakfast. The prices are high for the quality and portions you receive. The coffee is gross and the service is mediocre. I am unimpressed and would much rather spend my money at Le Peep in the arboretum, any Cracker Barrel or even Waffle House."}
{"text":"This place just kicks butt!! Sometimes you go to a place and they try to make things fancy for the sake of fancy. What Metro Diner has accomplished with their menu is fancy rooted in fundamentals. And it works SO well!! We've all heard of chicken and waffles. It's been done plenty. Metros version brings it home with the hot sauce maple syrup and strawberry butter. Sounds like a head scratcher but it's well thought out and over the top delicious. Another example is their vanilla coffee. It's not sweetened with syrup. The vanilla is brewed into the beans (I think). However they do it it's great. I drank it black. It was nice."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place after church with a friend this week and boy, am I glad that we did?! Upon our arrival we were told that  the wait could be up to 50 min, but we only waited about 25. We reviewed the menu as we waited. I decided on the chicken and waffles. The chicken was seasoned and fried to PERFECTION (wing, leg, thigh, breast) and the waffle was nice and fluffy, the strawberry butter was an awesome touch as well. The manager made rounds about 2-3 times during our visit, checking in on several guests to make sure everything was ok. Our waitress, Alice, was amazing! Very personable and attentive. I'll be sure to return soon. I'm excited to visit the new location in huntersville as well."}
{"text":"Enjoyed both times I have been.  Great if you are looking for comfort type food.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have only recently discovered this neighborhood restaurant. From the moment I walked in the door, I was greeted warmly, told to choose whatever seat I would like and before I could sit down, my chair was being pulled out for me by an attentive young man. My server was Chelsea and if anyone knows the meaning of customer service, it is she, her coworker DeAnne, and the manager, Lyn.  I had a perfectly lovely breakfast and, even though it was getting very busy at the lunch hour, I was encouraged to sit and finish my coffee and read my book for as long as I wanted. The food was fresh, appetizing and exactly the right temperature. I had been here once before, also for breakfast, again perfectly prepared and served, and the combination of the care in food preparation the courtesy of the staff and the ambience of a bright and cheerful restaurant mean that I will returning as a regular."}
{"text":"We have a standing weekly luncheon at Juan's Flaming Fajitas and we noticed this diner across the street. Based on the positive reviews, we ( 3 of us) decided to try this place today for some \"comfort food\". We arrived at 11:30 so it was not too busy. The girl at the podium asked if we'd like a booth we said yes and she pointed to the booths and  that was the end of the interaction. We walked over and sat ourselves in a booth. The waiter was the most positive part of the whole experience. He answered some questions and took our orders. We ordered bacon & eggs, eggs benedict and a pork sandwich with onion rings. The pork sandwich was specifically ordered without cheese. The breakfasts arrived followed a bit later by the pork sandwich covered in melted cheese. The waiter assured us he submitted the order without the cheese and went off to get a new sandwich. We had to eat our hot breakfasts while our friend waited for his new sandwich. At some point a woman who we assumed to be management came over and explained how you get used to making things a certain way and sometimes special orders get messed up. She then told us a story about a car crash on the 215 at 5:00 a.m. that morning. We assumed she was making small talk in hopes we would not notice how long it was taking to get a new sandwich. It would have been nice for her just to introduce herself and apologize and go find out why it was taking so long.......it felt more like she was telling us requesting no cheese was the root cause of the error. By now there were no other occupied tables and pretty much the entire staff was milling about in front of the kitchen area. Finally the sandwich was brought to the table without the onion rings - the waiter said they would be ready shortly. REALLY???? (I forgot to mention the .50 upcharge for the onion rings). At this point our friend requested his food be packed to go WHEN the onion rings were available as he was no longer in the mood for us to sit and watch him eat. The onion rings finally arrived in a to go box. I was finishing up my bacon & eggs when the waiter came back and actually said \"I hate to interrupt your meal and I'm not rushing you but can you please settle the bill now because the manager wants me off the floor right away?\" So I put my fork down and got money out to pay the bill which did have a credit for the pork sandwich and onion rings. This was not even close to the lunch experience we were hoping for at this diner. If I'm going to pay $30 + tip for  2 breakfast dishes and 2 soft drinks in this city, it sure won't be here! Very disappointed after all the positive hype on the reviews. P.S See you next week Juan!!!!"}
{"text":"BEYOND AWESOME.....we heard about the Metro Diner on the Radio Shopping Show.  thought we would give it a try today.  WOW.....it is so terrific.  there is an outside eating area as well.  the restaurant has a very friendly down home atmosphere.  and all I can say about the food, is it is AWESOME.  great portions and the staff stops by often to make sure you are happy.  the pricing is very reasonable.   it was just fantastic.   Clean and comfy.    will return on a regular basis.  its a blessing to find a restaurant that truly strives to provide quality food and great service.  love it..."}
{"text":"Family chose Metro over Denny's. Way better. They serve breakfast all day, and their kids menu is priced well and has plenty of options."}
{"text":"This is one of the friendliest and flavorful restaurants I have been to in the area. The staff is wonderful and always smiling and knowledgeable about the menu.   Loved this place so much had to come back for breakfast and absolutely was happy I did. While you would think that blueberry cheesecake stuffed waffles would be sweet these were wonderful and they make their compote in house which just shows the love and care they have for their food.   The biscuits and gravy were also fantastic plenty of sausage in the sawmill gravy and full of flavor. I leave with a smile on my face and a happy belly every time.   Thank you for the superb food and service. I will be back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Parking is challenging! There was absolutely no parking so we had to  leave.  What's the point of having a business if your customers can't park anywhere! Total waste of time!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food.  Always crowded but we get seated quickly. Comfort foods galore and really good.  And plentiful. Super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"After only being in the building for 4 days the Metro Diner team on Independence did an outstanding job. From the courteous host to our friendly and efficient waitress the service was great. The food came in a timely manner, in large portions and tasted great! There will definitely be a second time visit in the future."}
{"text":"As far as diners go, this one is top notch. Just a little pricey and always long lines. Bigger dining room maybe?"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Ordered the smothered chicken special.  2 small pieces of chicken covered with a shitload of shumck   3 pieces of grilled veggies   Waitress worthless worth asking WTF.  Wife's. Order when served waitress says we're out of fries wings should do. Walks away didn't care.  How the F do u run out of fries ! Two major grocery stores right next to u. Home now making a sandwich cuz metro Sucked!"}
{"text":"Visiting the area and wanted some good comfort food for breakfast. Found this place on yelp so decided to give it a try. Awesome! Staff is super friendly and attentive. We had John A as our server. He was great. Also he promoted the town and things to go and do in our travels! Food was really good, had the bissel breakfast a lot of food! Will come back for sure while we are in the area! Thanks!"}
{"text":"When I visited this place, (1st visit) with family on Tuesday (12/26) morning. The service at Metro Dinner on Stephanie in Henderson was not good. Our server was not attetentive to our table although we were her only customers. She was to busy socializing and texting on her phone. So I had to constantly get her attention for refills on coffee and water. The food potion are not equal to the servings.  Overly priced.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Good food and nice staff, we ordered the Cajun chicken pasta. Only thing I didn't like is I felt rushed when our waiter brought over the check right away. We'll most likely be back again though the food was really yummy !"}
{"text":"We were skeptical about trying the chicken and waffles, and came here with the family wanting to try. Our server, (Josh) gave us a little history on this place and gave us suggestions. Thanks Josh for being so good to us, we will definitely be back!  Very very pleased! Chicken was so tasty very close to Roscoe's..."}
{"text":"I'd give it a 3.5 if possible. Great server, manager, and cute diner counter seating. Good omelet, and crispy bacon (said my dining mate). But disappointing were the weak coffee, undercooked grits, and long wait time from ordering to receiving food. We liked it well enough to return soon for an even better experience, but probably not for breakfast."}
{"text":"Very good service. Our food came super quick. Best chicken and waffles I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"Service was gr8 and the food was AMAZING!!! I definitely recommend. Employees work very hard"}
{"text":"This is by far the best service I have Ever had. Say it again, best service I have ever had and I've worked in the service industry for 5 years and this place has it all. Ricky P was the definition of a genuine server and hospitality example. From the food being above and beyond delicious and the staff working together to bring drinks,bring the food, and the manager Peter was outstanding. This is definitely a place for my book and will be spreading the word about it and the outstanding service and food. Thanks Ricky,Peter, and the miss with cool 50's due."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this place only has 4 stars...  sure, it is a bit pricey but the food and service was exceptional.  I'd rather pay a bit more for food and service that's good than discounted mediocrity.  Maybe that's just me.  Kyle helped us, he was very personal and anticipated everything we might need.  I had chicken & waffles and was not disappointed.  Husband had the protein breakfast and was just as happy.  Manager/Owner Peter came by and introduced himself.  We will be returning."}
{"text":"Super Delish!!  So I ordered some breakfast to go so that I could speed race to my morning appointment. I walked in and thought the decor was super cute. It was like a cool combination of a new school diner with an old school touch. Folks that entered were told to have a seat and someone would be right over to assist them.  I ordered the Chicken and Waffles, listen here:  Chicken: You get an entire Half chicken, fried to the high heavens, hot, juicy, and perfect to fill your daily regret slot. This chicken was sooooooooo scrumptious! Seasoned to perfection. I didn't even consider the body fat repercussions! Holla.  Waffle: Nicely done basic waffle. The strawberry butter accompaniment was life.  I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"We went to this location one evening but it was a 30-40 minute wait and we didn't have time but vowed to return. We finally made it back for lunch over the weekend and were happy we did. My wife had the strawberry cheesecake stuffed waffles (daily special) and said they were amazing. I order the corned beef hash and had to protect it as my wife kept trying to steal it from me, it was so good. My 7 year old son had pancakes. All the food was great and way too much as we all took leftovers home. Will certainly be back to try some different items, though my wife said she is getting the corned beef hash next time."}
{"text":"They have Very good food, good customer service. Will definitely go back. All American restaurant."}
{"text":"I would say, after eating here, that i would return. Food was quite good with generous portions. Atmosphere was nice and cozy. By the time we left, around 8pm, the place was packed. Tuesday! That says a lot. Service was ok. The Reuben was a bit greasy but tasted good."}
{"text":"Great food, great people, great service!  Portion sizes are large and filling! All the food has great flavor and cooked fresh daily. The chicken and waffles were my favorite - they have a strawberry butter that tastes like ice cream. Their shrimp and grits were also very good, highly recommend. Definitely come here ready to eat and don't be surprised if you leave with a food baby."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and yummy comfort food, what more can you ask for?  I got the chicken and waffles, couldn't resist, and it was a huge half chicken serving with a nice, big Belgian waffle, served with a mini scoop of strawberry butter.  The chicken was marinated, and nice and crispy.  Waffle smelled so good.  It was crisp on the outside, tender inside - perfect.  They also have gluten free options, gf hamburger buns and toast for club sandwiches, etc.  I'm so glad it's close by and I'll will be back for more delicious options."}
{"text":"Cute little diner. OMG.. the meatloaf and gravy melts in your mouth. Our other friend enjoyed the spicy chicken and waffles with strawberry cream that she got crumbs all over her pants and syrup on her clothes and she didn't care. Definitely will come back on our next trip"}
{"text":"The croissant french toast is AMAZING!!!! It's so light and fluffy. I was worried it would be too sweet but it is perfection. The service was great, everyone in the restaurant was friendly. We also go the eggs, hash browns,and bacon...bacon was great but the hash browns lacked flavor. The fruity waffle was pretty good too. We will back for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing! This is the second location that I have been to in Charlotte and the food was consistent and delicious. I ordered the croissant French toast and it was so buttery and soft. Not too sweet and not too bitter...it was just right. The hostess stand needs a bit of work but other then that I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was my fianc√© and I's first time here it I couldn't be happier! The chicken and waffles were AMAZING!!! Thank you Metro Diner for a great experience! We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I went back with my family last weekend and I had to ask four times for my to-go box and got my coffee refilled when I asked for my check. We went around 8am on Sunday morning and it wasn't that busy so I am not sure why the service was poor."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Employees very friendly. We went at lunch and it was very busy. They got my daughter's order wrong and fixed it. They comp'ed us her meal. Definitely go again and the Charleston Shrimp and Grits are AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly and warm staff! Seat yourself dining. GREAT fried chicken. A true diner (breakfast, lunch and dinner menu available at all hours). Loved the classic, unpretentious casual environment especially on a lazy Sunday morning. Coffee is good. Just overall a really good comfort experience. Definite recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!!!...Great prices too!!....First time was today....but many more times wil come....Also, a very convenient location....We went to Cracker Barrel as it was my, and boyfriend's, usual Sunday meal at another state....We decided to visit the one in Las Vegas....way too full!!!....Searched on Yelp for nearby places with similar prices and Bam!!...Found this place!!!....It will be one of my favorite places now....and the coffee is very, very good!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ended up going 2 days in a row because there were so many meals we wanted to try! Breakfast was delicious. We got the Bissell and corn beef hash meals and everything was great! Today we came back for lunch and did the veggie wrap (add chicken) with Mac and cheese and the pork chop sandwich. Once again, not disappointed! We sat at the counter and it was mesmerizing  (and distracting). Definitely a new spot for us!"}
{"text":"A step above \"Run of the mill\". Pretty tasty for the price. Lots of food. Friendly staff. Don't expect a taste bud explosion. Just decent breakfast at a fair price. Don't order more than one thing on the menu, unless you plan to share."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, service is above average, one main complaint, one a little less of an issue. Main complaint, food never comes hot, I've sent food back several times to be reheated. Some food lacks seasoning. Some is great but some has been bland. Overall, very good for the money. Not too expensive and a good selection of foods. Chicken and waffles is good. Spicey Maple syrup with chicken really good."}
{"text":"Great place. Chicken and waffles is where it's at. Cone hungry or don't go at all. Great service"}
{"text":"Our first time here, everyone is so nice, loved the fish and chips  want to try everything on the menu"}
{"text":"Busy on a Sunday but only a 5 minute wait. Excellent coffee great french toast. Great service. Im new here and found a great place for breakfast"}
{"text":"Great place! I called ahead and was told they don't take reservations, so we went anticipating a long wait - we had a party of 22 hungry college runners and it was Friday night.  However, we were seated quickly even though the restaurant was quite busy. The manager Julie went out of her way to take care of us both when I called and while we were there, our server was excellent and really nice, and the food was delicious and inexpensive. A man named Darius, who made sure the orders came out correctly, was very kind and friendly to everyone who came in. We really enjoyed it !!!"}
{"text":"Burger over cooked and bun is hard as a rock.  Wish they had lettuce and tomatoes on this instead of coleslaw ???????  Told server and he didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"Typical American diner, but $1-3 pricier than others.  I'm the last customer of the night. Sushi cafe was closed, so I decided to try Metro Cafe. I wanted the chicken and waffles, but wasn't willing to pay $16.99 for it. I got the philly cheesesteak, which was recommended to me.  Food 4/5. Onion rings were great, big,  crispy, and unsalted. The philly cheesesteak tho... meat was good, it was hot and fresh, provolone cheese melted, grilled onions. I wasn't a fan of the pickled jalapenos. The deal breaker was the untoasted bread. Just a bit sad.  Service 5/5. Fantastic. Quick, welcoming, attentive even as I was the last one for the night.    Overall 4/5 for the price. Metro diner doesn't seem special enough to justify the higher costs."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here recently.  Excellent eggs, grits, bacon and biscuits.  So full, I couldn't eat for about 10 hours.  Have not tried the waffles, but they looked excellent.  Chatted with one of the cooks as they were pouring huge pots of grits into serving containers.  Very high quality grits.  I was very pleased with the level of quality and will be back later this week."}
{"text":"Awesome food and wonderful staff. Our waitress Jamie was extremely friendly and helpful. Try the shrimp and grits or chicken and waffles--you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My son saw the chicken and waffle picture and had to come here. So we took a breakfast date and sure enough, it was amazing. Best chicken & waffle we've ever had. I tried the hot sauce & syrup sauce with the chicken and the waitress was right, it's good!  We also ordered the San Francisco egg Benedict which was tasty as well. The service was great and the place has a nice laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! Friendly service! Really good food, with a lot of variety! Even on a busy day, we usually get right in, without a long wait."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great price. I got the two egg platter with hash browns and toast and it was huge! The scrambled eggs were cooked to my liking and the hashbrowns were very crispy."}
{"text":"This is a sweet spot!!! My husband and I love to go for there breakfest. I have the becon, egg, & cheese on croissant and home fries. It's my favorite. My husband loves the Eggs Benedict and home fries. I also enjoy the drink bar. Server's havecall been really great a deff"}
{"text":"Food was really better than I expected . I tried the chicken and waffles and my boyfriend got the shrimp n grits.  The waffles was great. Light fluffy and airy. I ordered the strawberry butter on the side. The chicken was juicy ,crispy and flavorful.  Had a bite of the fianc√©es shrimp n grits was so good . The grit cakes were good I had to go back in for a second bite. Shrimp were big n seasoned good. Kids ordered chicken tenders and grilled cheese they enjoyed it . I loved that the ranch was made in house ! And everything was fresh.  Dessert we tried the peach cobbler was relish we'll be back again"}
{"text":"First visit here. Rachel our waitress, quickly became our favorite waitress. She's was very attentive to all our needs and took the time to explain all the specials. Well ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle came with strawberry butter that was like holy sheep shit!! Absolutely great. I have nothing bad to say about our experience here and would highly recommend this place to everyone. Should you decide to visit here ask for Rachel as a waitress. She"}
{"text":"Had read really good reviews of Metro Diner, so tried it for dinner. Had not intended to order breakfast food, but certain things were so highly recommended that we decided to try them. I ordered the Crab Benedict, and wasn't disappointed. The hollandaise sauce was creamy, the eggs were perfect and the flavor combination was a winner. The crab was not lump crab, so don't expect Maryland quality crab meat. My husband, who normally does not order omelets, was tempted by the Meat Lover's omelet; he was pleasantly surprised- said it was great! Hash browns came with both our entrees and they were thin and crunchy- yum! The diner has a nice atmosphere with black and white tile floors, a counter with stools and  it was very clean. Nice crowd on Saturday at 5 with a large party in the back. Excellent service. The food is not inexpensive, but worth what you pay. I want to try the Turkey Pot Pie and Meatloaf, a few of their other recommended entrees. If you get a chance, try the Metro Diner!"}
{"text":"I ordered a sandwich and asked for no pickles, my plate came in and the pickles I requested to be gone were there. The biscuits and gravy were burnt. You pretty much get little to no attention from the servers. We got sat at a table that was still soaking wet from the last person that attempted to clean it. When it came time to getting refills, our server gave us someone else's drinks. Not quite sure how receiving the check here works, but our server placed it on our table as soon as he dropped off our food. I get that this place just opened and they're still trying to figure things out, but just blatantly ignoring guest is unacceptable. We were excited to come here after seeing all the great reviews and recommendations, but I doubt we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Very good stuff and quite the variety. Fried chicken was very good not overly seasoned.   My only issue on a Saturday afternoon was the bathroom was a huge mess. Paper towels heaping over floor very.  Staff were excellent.  The wrapped silverware gave a sense of comfort."}
{"text":"My best friend and I ate dinner there Christmas eve and had the Stuffing Waffle with turkey, mashed potatoes and gravy..... Everything, as usual, was so fresh and homemade (except the cranberry sauce which I didn't care about anyway) Whoever thought of this is genius! I know it's a seasonal dish but it sure would be nice to get this any time!!!  Deeeeeelicious!  This is our Christmas eve dinner spot from now on!!!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tasted here was good. By looking at everyone's post, you will see which ones are the ones everyone orders. I say take a chance and try other things because it will not let you down. They are the definition of the bomb.com. No lie!   They also have great service. I have not yet received any bad service from them. They are very attentive to their customers and make sure that our glasses are filled with water or whatever else we are drinking.   If you haven't checked them out, what are you waiting for, go get them extra calories in before the New Years because you already know one of your New Years resolutions is to get back into shape so eat up! LOL"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in walffles in the area!!! STRAWBERRY BUTTER IS TO DIE FOR! FAVORITE FAMILY DINER YET! Wish they had chicken fried chicken dinner though but thats it! Oh and rootbeer... lol"}
{"text":"Boy oh boy this place is life. This is a go to restaurant. I had the chicken and waffles. There was flavor all through the chicken and waffle. They also have a strawberry cream that looked like butter but it was mmmm good. My son had the bold city burger and he loved it it was a sausage and hamburger patty burger with jalape√±os mushrooms chipotle and lettuce on it. He said it was delicious. There fries taste like heaven (says my son). Our waitress provided great service Once you come here you will definitely come back for more!!!!!"}
{"text":"We've been there a couple times now, and the food has always been very good.  Service can be a little slow at times, but not so bad as to register a complaint about.    One thing I will comment on tho is the interior decoration.  I've eaten both outside on the \"patio\" and inside, and prefer outside ( tho it'd be good if the management could stop people taking smoking breaks on the bench around the corner).  But the inside just looks too dingy to me. I don't know what the owners were striving for in the design look, but it doesn't shout \"diner\" to me at all ... not like the ones' I've experienced in the NorthEast. The checkered floor appears grayish instead of black and white ..maybe a good cleaning would help. The dark wood booths also lend to the cheap, almost dank feel.  More like an old barbecue joint than a modern take on a \"diner\".  The entire inside needs to be lighter and brighter ( I suggest the owners take a look at the interior at Stacks for comparison).     So good food and good people, but please upgrade the inside a little !!!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I had the pleasure of meeting Nick and John from Jersey! The service here was impeccable! We received our food piping hot within 5 minutes after  ordering! We had the Bolt burger , shrimp and fried grits that was big enough for three peoples and sampled their amazingly juicy fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Breakfast done right. Their chicken and waffles is good. Chicken was nice and crispy and the waffle was fluffy. I like the strawberry butter and the spicy maple syrup. Home fries and sausage are also good and our eggs were cooked the way we ordered them."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't so loud. the food was great I got the eggs Benedict the eggs were perfectly poached the hollandaise sauce was delicious the entire dish was amazing. the biggest downfall for me is the noise in the resturant could barely hear my aunt sitting across the table from me."}
{"text":"Great food..great service & great prices !!! The staff is friendly & knowledgeable which makes ordering very easy!! Lunchtime is very busy but they do a great job of taking care of everyone!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here yesterday with friends and family from California. Its our first time here and i was surprise with how awesome the service was.. and the food was phenomenal, our favorite was the chicken and waffles! When i saw about 5-7 servers/runners came out with our food i was happy and in awe .. it was too short of a notice to accommodate a party of 19 but they did a great job from the girl i talked to over the phone christine and the host kyla and the awesome servers Shawn and Megan,  mngr/cooks & the rest of the crew.. Thank you for cooking up a good meal! We will definitely come back and will recommend Metro Diner!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Can't see why this place has the number of stars it has. Toast was burned & dry, egg whites were undercooked. Reuben sandwich was salty, fries are a commercial frozen product. At the prices they are charging they could at least cut fresh fries, they seem to have the volume for it. Food was hot and fast considering a busy Saturday at lunch time. Server was great, friendly and attentive despite her overbearing manager. Basically I could get the same (probably better) meal at any one of the nearby sports bars for less money.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"This neighborhood diner is great.  The food is very good and the service is terrific!  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Food is pretty tasty. It's a bit pricey for a diner though. Service has always been good and everyone is really friendly. Biscuits and gravy is my go to. French vanilla coffee is pretty weak, so I wouldn't try that again lol. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The best chicken and waffles in town!!!    Also, Andy, our waiter is awesome and their French vanilla coffee is the perfect cup of joe!   We love eating breakfast/ brunch here"}
{"text":"Abosoutly one of the best breakfast I've had I order the chicken and waffle plate and it was delicious!  my boyfriend ordered the stuffed French toast (forgot the name ) but very very good as well . The service was great and quick ."}
{"text":"The Classic Eggs Benedict were cooked perfectly and very tasty. I got the home fries instead of hash browns. Huge portion. Next time I'll try the corned beef hash. Service was excellent even though it was packed."}
{"text":"What a cute place! I had been looking forward to dining here, and Metro Diner lived up to the hype! I like the diner vibe. Our host & waiter EJ was super friendly and welcoming. He was very knowledgeable about the menu. I appreciated that he went over the specials and the green-highlighted favorites on the menu. He also asked if we had any questions about the menu items. Given that this is a newer establishment in our area, I was so pleased to have been greeted and served by such a kind and enthusiastic employee. EJ is a great representative for the diner. There were a lot of attractive items on the menu. Prices were reasonable. I like that breakfast is available all day and that alcohol is also available. I ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta, and it was really good. Maybe a little bit too spicy but still good - and filling too. My boyfriend got the Phillip Cheese Steak and said it was delicious. He also thought the Bloody Mary was really good. The diner got quite a bit busier throughout our meal, and I felt bad for EJ having to play host, waiter, and cashier to practically the entire floor of tables, but he remained positive. It looked like employees started to slowly trickle in at around 5:30 to help him out. All in all, a good experience. I fully intend to return to Metro Diner."}
{"text":"We have gone to this place about 4 times now and it started out ok and just started to decline slowly every visit. They always have a long wait but we are just over it. You will survive, just not with us."}
{"text":"Have enjoyed many meals here. Great selection of gluten free meals - have not been accidentally \"glutened\" Have dined with family and lunch with a friend. Always greeted promptly and seated and served quickly. Only time we've had to wait for a table is Sunday after church."}
{"text":"I love this place, matthews needed a good diner. Their menu selection is amazing, they have something for everyone."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great find!  My husband and I came here for an anniversary brunch on New Year's Day.  Great food, great service and really cool atmosphere - we will definitely be back.  Happy New Year 2018!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the great dining experiences in Las Vegas. Not only do they have excellent customer service  and everyone is willing to help but the food is perfectly cooked and the portions are big. Such a nice place to go. Phillip was awesome !"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch, pot roast with mashed red potatoes and veggies . Took half home 2 huge pieces of roast. Excellent! My friend had a wrap with chicken and great fries. Huge portions and taste great. Will be back."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken and waffle. Big portions of chicken and waffle. Definitely you can share with someone."}
{"text":"This was my second and LAST visit to Metro Diner, Las Vegas.  I'm not sure how a restaurant can manage to ruin a basic salad with grilled chicken on it, but they did!  The lettuce was wilted, the cucumbers were clear in color and frozen, the cherry tomatoes were old & shriveled and the chicken was stringy and tough!  It was a surprise that they would even serve a salad like this to a customer in their restaurant.  There are too many restaurants in the Las Vegas areas that have edible and delicious food to eat at, sadly this is not one of them.  They can learn from any one of them!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and excellent quality of food. The portions of food are quite large and I could have easily shared it.   Metro Diner is a great place for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I went for dinner one night you had the codfish special and another day I went for breakfast and had the French toast, both times the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Ralph was such a nice waiter and made sure my boyfriend & I had everything we needed. Already loved Metro Diner, but can't wait to return due to great service!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times I had the chicken and waffles that were very tasty, another time I had the yo hala French toast it was god but very sweet, this last time I had the Benedict the English muffin was tuff, so it wasn't as enjoyable as I had hoped. The  service had been good until this last visit, we were seated right away but we're forgotten and ignored for over 5 min, many waitress's walked by but none bothered to ask if any one was waiting on us, we had to go to the front and ask if anyone was going to wait on us, after that it took another 5 min until someone decided they would. I takes one bad experience for me not to come back. Bummer!"}
{"text":"This is a very cute and clean diner. Their food quality is nothing but average and traditional, similar to what you can get at a Waffle House or other traditional diners at a better price."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! The waitress checked on us just enough to be comfortable. The staff made friendly conversations.  I ordered the 3 cheese grilled cheese and it was delish! Gooey and toast has the perfect crunch.  My husband ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was juicy on the inside, lightly battered on the outside.  I didn't try the waffles but he packed the remaining to go so I'm pretty sure he liked it! We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wanted to check this out since they opened a bunch of metro's around town. Got there for dinner & was greeted warmly and told to sit wherever we liked. Place looked clean & quaint. We ordered a philly steak and fish & chips. The philly steak was good but very light on cheese. We were told cheese is expensive. I didn't care too much for the fish. I should have asked what kind of fish they used. It was some kind of cat fish and the batter wasn't to my liking either. We were never offered refills on our soft drinks. My husband had to ask & there seemed to be a slight hesitation from the waiter in getting a refill. (Maybe there's no free refills on soft drinks?) When it came time to pay we paid our waiter & asked for change. To my utter shock & horror he returned and said he was short 75 cents. Believe me it's not the 75 cents but the principle. When did it become acceptable to short a customer money?!  Is this not a business where money is transacted? So why doesn't this establishment have money to give me as my correct change? I feel so badly for these inexperienced kids who aren't trained properly at their job or life for that matter and make these  errors that end up costing them in the long run. Well we shorted him in his tip. Hope he reads this and learns a lesson. Always give customers the correct change. Metro diner wasn't that good to back especially when waiters keep your change. Plenty of restaurants in Vegas -on to something better."}
{"text":"I have been to both Henderson locations. I have had good and bad food experiences in both. However, tonight I came into the one on stephanie. I ordered the ruben. Usually I can only eat 1/2. Tonight I had to put all of the scrawny meat on one half. It was salty as heck and when I left I felt nauseous. I hope I don't puke later!! I will stay away for a while. I hate when a new place opens up and is amazing, then slowly goes down the toilet."}
{"text":"Visited today for the very first time. We've never been to any Metro Diner before and they just opened one by my house. Service was amazing. Food was delicious. I had the chicken and waffles/waffles were super light weight and super crunchy so they okay chicken was tasty my hubby loved it. Hubby ordered the meatloaf he devoured it, and is now complaining that he ate too much.  But he enjoyed it.  Prices are too high for a simple diner and they had no special pricing or deals for a place that just open no grand opening no nothing just a sign \"Now Open\".    That was a little disappointing"}
{"text":"Love Metro Diner. They actually know how to scramble an egg!! Lots of food for the price. And friendly staff."}
{"text":"Lazy quick review:  Awesome, elevated diner food, Friendly servers, must try spot for brunchers!  Crab Benedict = 8/10 good, lots of crab  Chicken and waffles = 10/10 chicken was amazing and strawberry butter was delicious  Meatloaf = 9/10 delicious, especially if you're a fan of loafed meat.   All American burger = 8/10 slaw was interesting, Worked overall though!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch (first visit). The place is cute, clean and the service was good. We ordered 1) the shrimp Po-Boy special. The shrimp were perfectly cooked in a tempura like batter and the aioli had just right amount of spice. The complements stop there. The tomato slices (2) on this large sandwich were paper thin, the shredded lettuce had a brown tinge and the roll was very dry/stale. Mac-n-cheese was dried out like it had been sitting exposed for a while. 2) The chicken salad sandwich...the chicken salad (alone) was good, nice and fresh. The bread was dried out/stale. We took the salad off of the bread and ate it separately. The pasta salad had very hard spiral pasta on top as this had been dished out and prepped hours ago.   We won't be back. Sorry."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner the other night on Saturday after another busy day this weekend. I have always been a fan of Metro diner so i never mind coming here to try new things every time !   A friend had arrived earlier and was seated waiting for us to arrive. Upon entry, the hostess had instantly known and brought us to join him at the table.   As always, service is great. Very attentive in every way.   I decided to try the Metro Club. It includes ham, turkey, bacon, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mayo on 3 slices of fresh white toast. HUGE sandwich cut into quarters. I only ate 2 quarters and saved the other 2 quarters for breakfast the next day. It comes with half a pickle, which is delicious as always. Lots of meat piled up with a thick slice of bacon. Simple but delicious.   One of my friends got the Bissel Breakfast. Two eggs any style, choice of bacon/ham/sausage, choice of hashbrowns or grits, and a short stack of pancakes. She opt'ed for bacon with hashbrowns. I don't remember the eggs as the yolks were gone FAST ! wtcrap girl ! i didn't even see a drop of residual yolk, anywhere ! the hashbrowns had a very crispy top layer, which almost all disappeared as well, but luckily she got full and i got some of it. HEHE ! Last but not least, the short stack of pancakes. Anyone who knows me knows ive been sick of any sort of pancakes for like the past 10 years, since the one time a few friends and I decided to take advantage of IHOP's free pancake day... For some off reason, this pancake was really good. Another thing i noticed, the syrup was hot ! Unlike the syrups that sit around on the table all day long. I don't know what sort of drug they put in this pancake but it was good ! jk about the drug. i cant explain it !   Last but not least, my other friend ordered the fried chicken & waffle. half a fried chicken and a belgian waffle, topped with powdered sugar and sweet, strawberry butter. Served with their signature sweet and spicy sauce. When the food came, the waitress had accidentally dropped a piece of chicken on the floor. She QUICKLY apologized and had another one made ASAP ! He's not one to eat a small amount but requested help for the chicken. When the replacement piece came, we took it instead. I got the drumstick while my friend who ordered the bissell breakfast took the mid and tip. The chicken was super flavorful and juicy. VERY reminiscent of korean fried chicken i had in Korea ! Even the white meat part that somehow ended up on this wing was very juicy and flavorful. Of course it was super hot since it just came out of of the fryer but dang. They definitely put the chicken in a brine of some sort because, YUM ! Their signature sweet and spicy sauce consists of the previously mentioned warm syrup and hot sauce. The chicken doesn't need anything !! i mean, some spice is always welcome, but if you dont like spice, its definitely not a requirement.   Another good meal ! Cant wait to try other things again !"}
{"text":"I recently came across Metro Diner via Yelp and decided to check it out since I was nearby. Metro diner doesn't disappoint!! I had the meatloaf plate which was delicious and I would definitely recommend. Can't wait to come back and try the shrimp & grits next."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Hash browns perfect, service impeccable and spicy chicken biscuit with honey amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I visit metro diner often, my husband loves the veggie wrap and my son loves the kids pancakes. I enjoy trying different items on the menu but the only item I have ordered more than once was the eggs benny. (Delish) I love when they have the vanilla coffee it's amazing wish you offered it more than the hazelnut. All in all it's a great family friendly restaurant that we enjoy dining at."}
{"text":"I'll keep this one short and sweet. Fast seating, great service, delicious breakfast, for the right price. I hope this spot doesn't become like every other breakfast spot around here with a two hour wait so that we can come back. Phillip was my server and he was such a sweetheart and great with my son. The pound cake French toast was to die for, next time I want to try the croissant French toast and the chicken and waffles. Thanks, Metro Diner, so glad you're here!"}
{"text":"I went with a friend to Metro Diner for brunch on Sunday, 4/29... We arrived, and, due to the number of people standing and sitting around, we were not surprised to hear that they had a 45 minute wait... so we put our name down and took a seat outside... I noticed that those waiting already had big mugs of hot coffee... so I popped my head in and asked if we might get some too... the hostess asked if we'd like to sit outside because no one wanted that table... so, as things turned out, we were seated nearly immediately!  What a happy accident...  I had the two egg breakfast... the bacon was crisp, my poached eggs were lovely (the side of hollandaise was way too big, but no matter), the GRITS were WONDERFUL, and the biscuits were fluffy, buttery, and delightful!  For my money, this was a delightful meal, and I will be going back!!  PS - The service was prompt and very attentive.  They're doing a GOOD job here!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out based off Yelp reviews!  Got a to-go order and placed it over the phone. I had ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta along with a side garden salad. Long story short, I got home and had high hopes for the pasta, but it unfortunately fell short. The cheese topping was definitely shredded/grated cheese (the same one that's on salads, I believe it was cheddar cheese). Also the food was already cold when I took it back which was disappointing! Overall I felt like I was eating one of those microwavable pasta dinners and was disappointed.  For the price (Paid around $14~, can't remember), I definitely expected better. I wish I could give a higher rating for this place since I've seen reviews complimenting their service and food, so I'm not sure if I just picked up an order on an off day."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Came for lunch and enjoyed breakfast. Our food came out timely. The staff was courteous and helpful. I even saw a few to stop to regulars and kids, bringing smiles to their faces."}
{"text":"Get the pancakes stuffed with blueberry cheesecake the best! I think it was a weekend special. So when it's available I suggest you try it."}
{"text":"The first time to diner for Breakfast, service was great but food was awful.The corn beef was just potato and some beef while son egg dry, and bacon overcook. Offer change corn beef but other items probably the same. Would not recommend for Breakfast while there for Breakfast menu but disappointed."}
{"text":"The whole family loved it.  The food is delicious and the service was great.  Highly recommended.  We were in town for 2 days and had breakfast there both mornings.  We tried a bunch of menu items including \"Peach French toast\", \"Chicken and waffles\", \"Shrimp and Grits\", \"Eggs Benedict Oscar style\", and \"Chicken tender sandwich\".  Every item we had we enjoyed.  Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Lemme tell you the RIDICULOUSNESS that is metro diner. I mean this all in a good way though friends.  Service is so excellent that they're able to keep up with some custom orders AND get them out in a timely, with a smile. Today's option was the mom omelette with two extra eggs, a beef patty, and extra crispy hash INSIDE the omelette... previous orders were Charleston shrimp and Grits with 4 extra pics of fried chicken... A burger with and extra regular party, chorizo party, fried egg, poached egg, and all the fixings. These guys will do any food item.  You may be thinking that all this heaviness is a bit much, but I'm accustomed to heavy dishes and they're a diner that actually doesn't overdo it with the grease... unless you ask them to. Great flavors. The chicken is almost always magically juicy. The grits have a nice crispy outside texture and smooth inside texture. The burgers are always done well. The hazelnut coffee hits the spot before a really heavy workout session. Great food and great atmosphere.  Will definitely eat again.  P.s.  I eat here 2 hours before a workout on weekends. Once that coffee hits you after your meal, you'll have the ability to go on forever. I hit a PR last time I ate here."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and the service was exceptional. Food came out fast and was very good. We came on a Wednesday at 530 and there was no wait. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas last week and came across this place  while searching on yelp for a a good place to eat, all the good reviews caught my attention so decided to stop in. I have to say my expectations of a Diner are not very high -but this place definitely raised the bar high, from the moment I came in the hostess (I think her name was Sofia) was very friendly and got us seated right away despite the obvious rush of people coming in. The food was fantastic! I had the Chicken and Waffles and they were perfect. The best part of it all was our waitress, her name is Jaci and she definitely was the highlight of our visit with her warm, friendly and positive attitude I can tell that she enjoys her job very much and she's was very good at it, she was always on top of it anticipating our needs all with a smile on her face despite the fact she was waiting on several tables and the place looked so busy. The food was amazing but I have to say this review is for the people that work there as they are who make Metro Diner one of the best diners I've ever been in. Until next time!"}
{"text":"We tried Metro Diner on a whim.  I am thoroughly pleased with the taste of the home cooking and the exceptional customer service I've received.  Been there a few times now and I am still receiving the great service (from Patience, AJ, Chris and Robin so far!).  The strawberry butter is magical and a unique taste to slather on a waffle.  Had breakfast there on Father's Day and even though they were extremely busy, I still received the excellent customer service.  It's a very friendly place and the food is spot on.  Well Done!"}
{"text":"I promised to come back and order something different. Tonight I ordered the turkey plate. Turkey was very good and the side vegetables were excellent. Gravy was just ok...not much taste. The only thing I didn't like was the dish was served with a piece of French bread that was just tossed into the mashed potatoes.   Overall the meal was much better than my original post so I have given them 4 stars.   Total bill (water) with tip was 14.35. Reasonable for a fresh tasty turkey breast  dinner."}
{"text":"Yummy food! Loaded hash browns! Peach Iced Tea!  Thanks Ralph for the great service & grub!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service very friendly and amazing food! Check out their manhattan style clam chowder it's amazing!!!! And the San Francisco Benedict. And their amazing chicken salad sandwich. I'm pretty sure all their food is quality it feels gourmet!"}
{"text":"First time here. Will definitely be back. Everyone was beyond friendly and smiling, even the guests. Monique was wonderful. Seriously, it's very hard to find good service here in Vegas, but this place is spot on. Even the manager came over and checked in. We sat outside on the patio. The food came out in literally like 6 minutes it was crazy fast. Plus it was absolutely fantastic. I was actually disappointed that I couldn't finish it all! I ordered the Avocado Toast (add spinach), 2 over medium eggs and crispy hash browns and my brother ordered the Big Mikes BLT (I think that's what it was called) and it was humongous! All around 5 stars."}
{"text":"I love the metro Diner it like a old fashioned diner. They have a great breakfast menu and the meal are very  delicious looking.It was hard for me to choice,which dish I wanted.I choice the turkey sausage and hashed brown Eggs and big juicy biscuits..it was delicious. The service is excellent and fast.I recommend Metro Dining if want something different to eat."}
{"text":"I had the absolute best chicken and waffles. The waffle was huge! The chicken was a half of chicken fried to perfection and the strawberry butter was the icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, service and atmosphere.  Be sure to ask for John A he takes care of his patron!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was so nice! I come from a town where diners are everything.  And this reminded me so much of home.  The ambiance, the service, everyone really made you feel like you were home.  And it was good comfort food, doesn't make you too full and was good as leftovers.  They had this amazing thing, strawberry butter... omg this was amazing! It was like strawberry ice cream on top of my waffles.  I will go back here JUST for that.  So completely forgot to mention I had chicken and waffles, at 2 in the afternoon... (something that's definitely hard to find), and my server Dario made a sauce for my chicken and let me know what everything was, he knew that menu so well, and it was so appreciative.  The food took less than 15 to come out, but it was during a time where there was only two other tables.  Regardless, it would be worth the wait to feel like your in a place where you feel welcomed and have a happy belly by the end of it. You'll be seeing me soon Metro Diner!"}
{"text":"This diner is popping up everywhere around Vegas, and it's completely understandable.  They're amazing! We've gone to two different ones and the service was amazing regardless of location and the food was delicious. They have actual fried chicken here which is always a goal for me, it's a hard thing to find in Vegas. They range from average portions to \"omg I need to take this home\" portions.  They're only open until 8 which is kind of a bummer but personally I feel like it's all worth while.  No grumpy workers, food is on point, clean environment.  That's a win win for me! Their deserts are made daily and constantly changes and so do the specials, I've never tried the specials but the desserts are super yummy! I think the reason I enjoyed this place so much was because it had a small town diner feel to it, and it was super nice to experience that right down the street.  Check this place out if you happen to drive by. Honestly, you won't regret it. :)"}
{"text":"So, saw this place on instagram and thought why not try it out. They did not disappoint! Food was awesome! It's a cute little diner on Hwy 51 here in Charlotte. You get a lot of food with your order. Staff is friendly and always quick to check on you. Food came out quickly. I would highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Stopped by Saturday morning for breakfast and decided to make my order to go due to the 25-30 min wait...not a problem.  Ordered the Southern Benedict with cheese grits at the recommendation of the staff and was very disappointed with the quality of this dish. Not to mention my food sat for 15-20 min before it it was given to me after I asked of the progress. I asked the manager to check the quality of the food before I left and he assured me it was fine.  As expected, my portions were incredibly small for Metro standards, there was almost no gravy which was one of selling aspects of the Southern Benedict, my poached eggs over done and the cheese grits had clumped due to the temperature.  I have been to other locations and the service and quality at those locations were fantastic, this was very disappointing. On a bright note, the manager did give me a voucher for my next breakfast so I'll give this location one more try."}
{"text":"Had a great experience, the food was amazing and the service was better. We had Ralph and he had amazing recommendations and was really helpful! Convinced me to get the fried chicken sandwich and I loved every bite."}
{"text":"Ok I'm always looking for something different to eat,but in Vegas that's almost like gambling you might hit or take a big loss with food places in this town. I've been burnt by a couple of them. But this place is pretty good. It only has been open for about two months. The service was on point!!The young lady who served us was awesome Kristen or Kristy I believe I hope i got her name right.  You have to try the meatloaf  it's pretty good. My mom had the chic and waffles it was tasty, especially that strawberry butter yum .Damn I'm getting hungry just typing this.  Ok anyways give them a try you'll like it ."}
{"text":"I wasn't exactly pleased with the food or service when dining at Metro Diner.  I ordered the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw on the side.  The reuben had WAY too much thousand island dressing on it. Literally, it was soaking through my bread, and was a huge mess to eat.  It completely took any flavor away from the corned beef and sour kraut.  The coleslaw didn't have enough dressing, and was a bit bland.  My boyfriend ordered the juevos rancheros, and there were hardly any eggs on it, with an excessive amount of cheese.  It seemed more like an order or nachos than juevos rancheros.  So, the worst part of my dining experience was towards the end of my meal, when the waitress dropped an entire pitcher of iced tea next to my table, drenching me.  She did hand me some napkins, and said sorry, but I couldn't believe we weren't offered a discount or a manager's apology or something.  It was just treated like a no-big-deal thing.    Anyway, I had high hopes for this place, but I will likely not return."}
{"text":"We came here around 9am on a Sunday. We were immediately seated and greeted by almost every employee in the restaurant! The GM was walking around and making conversation with every table which was awesome. Our server was very sweet and friendly too. We ordered the huevos rancheros and a two egg breakfast. The food came out unexpectedly quick. Everything was delicious! It was a little pricy for breakfast but the experience overall made up for it. Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Honestly nothing too special. I was expecting a much better experience and i thought the waiters and waitress people were not properly dressed too."}
{"text":"Awesome, home made meals!!  Great service! Server Autumn was the best. I had the meat loaf and it was divine.   Little crispy on the outside and tasted amazing.  Definitely recommend this place. I will be back.  ."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The chicken pot pie is SO GOOD! Everyone we encountered was nice and  welcoming. Our server was \"Zo\" and he was awesome! Very friendly and helpful. This is a great place to eat and it seems like everyone likes their job. Such a great change from other places we've been :)"}
{"text":"First day of opening and everything was on point.. food, staff, service.. excellent! Our table ordered the yo hala on the square, crab benedict, and a burger with an egg that was on the specials board.. All delicious  bad part of this experience that this place is across the street from our house.. we will be coming here a lot!"}
{"text":"I've only been here the one time, but it was absolutely lovely! I'm such a huge sucker for old school diners, I'm not sure why. Maybe I have some weird obsession with poodle skirts, who knows?   Anyway, I got the Bold City Burger (is that what it's called? It's one of the special burgs) and it was delicious! Bun? Good! Meat? Good! Bacon? Good! Fried jalape√±os? Excellent!! ANDDDD I didn't want fries or chips and I wanted hashbrowns and I got what I wanted!! A perfect mix of lunch and breakfast. I didn't take any pictures (I know, SAD!) because I was too busy eating. Sorry. But just get the burger. It's amaze."}
{"text":"So the service was pretty good, but the order was a bit messed up.  The cheesy grits were lumpy but the flavor was good.  The yo halla stuffed challa bread was huge and treated great.  The pancakes did not have any butter on them. The mac and cheese was cheesy and smooth. The portions are large.  I would be willing to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Place looks and feels nice. Service was good but I'm sorry the chicken and waffles were terrible. Was not able to finish it. Possibly the worst I've ever had.  It seemed a bit overpriced for it too."}
{"text":"Best chicken & waffles I've ever had - a half broiler cooked to perfection.   Went at my own on a Saturday mid-morning & sat at the counter looking into the kitchen. The guys & gals in the kitchen were all over it - you could tell they cared about the product & man they work fast too. Service was warm & prompt. They pour a pretty good diner coffee too.   If you come in a group at peak brunch time be prepared to wait 20-30min for a table. But if you are on your lonesome (like I was) you'll probably a get a seat at the counter right away.   I'll definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant opened up right around the corner from my home and I was a bit skeptical as it was right next to a AutoZone and the visual appearance on the outside was iffy ish. Nonetheless we went inside and give it a try and boy am I happy that we did, the food is great and the service is very good will repeat"}
{"text":"First time eating here... it was packed but I was by myself so I didn't have to wait long for a table lol waiter was fast and cute food was delicious waffles topped with fruit fruit was fresh hash browns edges bacon everything cooked to perfection it's a must go if your in the area"}
{"text":"Great place !!  First time here and was very pleased ! The place was packed and the service was amazing!   Great selection of food and hearty portions ! I had the corn beef hash and eggs and my wife had the two egg breakfast ! Want to go back and have the Chicken and Waffles! Looks like a ton of food and most popular item being ordered!   Corn Beef Hash was cooked perfectly without being greasy! Poached eggs were slightly overdone but still yummy ! Great place for family and looking forward to going back !"}
{"text":"Very welcome to the neighborhood. We were needing a diner. Crew is sometimes a bit \"sticky\" by asking you if \"everything's fine\" when you can't even reply cause you are eating. Lol! Can keep a little bit more clean restrooms and give extra napkins., cause you only receive one. Besides that, great food, great portions and prices. Weekends is fully crowed.  I love having breakfast. French vanilla coffee is so great!  **Sorry, actually I gave you a 5 stars**"}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place so decided to give it a shot, the food is pretty good I had the breakfast burger which is pretty dang big, was very satisfied with it. I returned and had the protein breakfast and was kinda bland. The service is great and would come again."}
{"text":"Good service had the hot turkey plate. Unfortunately it was extremely over salted. However server gave us a coupon to replace the dinner.   I will be happy to try them again !"}
{"text":"Great food/staff. Real home-cooked flavors, hefty portions and great atmosphere. Meatloaf plate was wonderful (featured in Guy Fierie's show). Shrimp and grits also a standout. Perfect place for when you're hungry but not sure what you want. They also have incredible daily specials... will be back for the fried chicken and waffle plate."}
{"text":"It was nice to discover this new breakfast place on Yelp.  It's a little further for us to drive than we normally would, but traffic isn't bad on a Sunday morning.    The diner is in a strip mall in Pineville (down the street from the mall) and doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you get inside, it's decorated very homey.  You wouldn't know you're in a strip mall.  The decor reminds me of the Corner Bakery Cafes I've been to in Chicago.    We were seated right away (I guess we got there just before the brunch crowds) and the hostess informed us we could help ourselves to the Beverage Bar.  At first, I thought it was strange for us to serve ourselves, but then I realized it was kind of cool.  There are a variety of coffees - regular, decaf, and flavor of the day.  Then there are water, iced teas, and a soda fountain.  They're all one price, so I guess you could potentially mix and match throughout your meal if you wanted.  I tried the French Vanilla coffee and enjoyed it.  Note: our server did refill our coffees for us, so it wasn't completely self-serve.    The menu had a lot of great options (which I LOVE in a breakfast place).  I went with the San Francisco Benedict, which is an eggs benedict with Canadian bacon, sliced avocado, and tomato.  It was everything I wanted out of a benedict; the Hollandaise sauce was creamy and tasty, too.  The benedict came with a side of hashbrowns (although you could substitute).  The hashbrowns were great, too, -- crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.    There were many other dishes to try in the future.  They have a variety of omelets, breakfast sandwiches, other benedicts, pancakes, French toast, and other misc egg dishes.  There are also lunch and dinner options, including a variety of salads.    For a diner, we had a great experience, and I'm happy to add Metro Diner into our breakfast rotation."}
{"text":"So glad that Metro Diner opened up this second location in Charlotte.  It's much closer to us than the one in Pineville and occupies a space that I've always liked.    We've visited this Metro Diner several times for breakfast so far since they've opened (and brought several out-of-town guests here as well).  Obviously we've loved our breakfasts since we keep coming back.  It's nice to have an alternative to Stack's Kitchen in Matthews, which we also love, but is usually difficult to get a table for breakfast on weekends.    We've even eaten dinner at Metro Diner once on our most recent visit.  During this visit, we came by on a Saturday evening around 7:30 PM.  There was a line, so we decided to do some shopping beforehand and come back.  We got back around 8:30 and there was no line.  However, we noticed on the door that they closed at 9:00 PM.  Yikes!  Being a diner, I just assumed they were open later, like maybe 11 or 12.  We still went in because the place was super crowded, so it's not like we were the only ones there.  (Hint: maybe you should stay open later?)  We were quickly seated and greeted by our server Taylor.  She was super friendly and speedy.   My partner ordered the Western omelet (yes, breakfast (and even lunch and dinner) is served during all hours).  It was filled (and overflowing) with ingredients.  Since I've had their breakfast items several times, I wanted to try something different.  I opted for the Bold City Burger -- Provel cheese, caramelized onions, bacon, sausage (yes, both!), fried jalapenos, and garlic aioli.  It tastes as good as it sounds.  It was truly amazing -- juicy and flavorful.  I'd definitely order it again.  There are a lot of side options to pick from; I went with the sauteed veggies, which happened to be yellow squash and zucchini that evening.  They were a little charred, which is my favorite.  Another good choice.  I could have eaten even more of them.   Since opening, Metro Diner has been a great, new breakfast option for us.  Now they've become a dinner option as well.  Good food at a reasonable price.  Now if they can only stay open a bit longer..."}
{"text":"This diner has some promise. I think you experience here may depend on the dishes you get. We got the chicken pot pie, the Greek salad, chicken fingers and meatloaf. The Greek salad was disappointing. It was pretty much a pile of iceberg lettuce with a dusting of feta cheese, three cherry tomatoes, boxed croutons and not much else. The chicken pot pie was way too salty. The chicken fingers were cold. The meatloaf was the best of what we had but nothing special. I know they are really popular but with all the great options in Vegas, I'd skip this place."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast one morning and was instantly greatest by the host and another server. I was seated right away and got to order my drink as well. Jaci (sp?) Was my service and she was awesome. She was super attentive and had the best customer service. Everything on the menu looked good and she did a good break down of what's popular and what she prefers. I ultimately went with the chicken and waffles. When they came out I was surprised because I was not expecting such a big portion. I got 2 or 3 chicken thighs and a chicken leg. Huge. The waffles were a good size as well. I was kind of weirded out by their signature sauce because they literally put a sauce in front of you and dump syrup and Louisiana hot sauce in it. I wasn't really a fan of it. The waffle was delicious. The strawberry butter was delicious. The chicken was super crispy and cooked perfectly on the inside. Super juicy. My only complaint is the chicken was ridiculously salty. I couldn't finish it because there was no flavor to it. It just tasted like pure salt. I was so sad because it was so crispy and juicy. I really have never had a chicken cooked that perfectly! On the way out I was greeted again by at least 5 different staff members. The manager also made rounds at my table to ask how everything was.  Overall I really enjoyed the service and atmosphere. I'd love to come back and see what else is good on their menu!"}
{"text":"We are locals and always go to the other place down the street. Today we decided to try something different. LOVE this place as well. Excellent food and customer service. The atmosphere is cozy and relaxing. However the brick wall would look AMAZING if it was painted it's natural brick red colors and beige grout. The colors would complement the green tables and checkered floor to perfection! (I know a talented artist that lives here in Vegas if the owner would like to contact me for an estimate! I can get you in touch with her.)"}
{"text":"Maaaaaaaaaaaaaan..... I accidentally saw this place one day as I was in the area.   It caught my attention and I said hey let's check out this Diner.  Welp little to my expectation this place is like - incredible!  The food is always good, the menu is filled with variety( something for everyone's taste).  The service is wonderful and it is just a very well ran restaurant!  I dig everything that I have tried from this  restaurant thus far!  Check this place out if you are into a restaurant with good service,good food, and affordable! :)"}
{"text":"Over priced, rude staff, you have to make and refill your own beverages. My husband found plastic in his 13.00 grits. This isn't a local business, they're a chain from Florida. If you're looking for Carolina charm this isn't it. The food however is decent... Other than the random things you may find in it... Like plastic."}
{"text":"Would I come back? Located just 15 mins away from the strip is this diner that serves some really delicious breakfast/brunch items. There is going to be a wait during the weekends so be sure to come early.  Everything on the menu sounds delicious but I narrowed it down to two items to try. I ended up ordering the fried chicken and waffles and croissant french toast.   Fried chicken and waffles come with hot maple syrup. The server brings it over and adds a little Louisiana hot sauce to it. The mixture paired well with the chicken and the waffles. The waffles were super soft and crispy on the edges. I do not think I have ever had waffles this spectacular before. The chicken was moist and fried to perfection.   The croissant french toast was buttery and fluffy. It is not like any other french toast I have had before. It had a chewiness to it as well and you do not need to add much maple syrup to it as well.   Our server was attentive but messed up my coffee order. I wanted regular coffee but she brought over hazelnut instead. The coffee tasted great so I did not mention it to her. Once I was done with my coffee, she brought over a refill as well. Prices are fair and portions are large. There might be trouble finding parking since they share it with other businesses but I was lucky enough to catch someone leaving."}
{"text":"Straight up legit diner. No frills, just simple darn good food. The staff was amazingly friendly and easily engaged in conversation. I went with a friend who is a professional chef and he raved about his meal. I wanted to try so many things, but when I saw the monte cristo sandwich, I had to order it because not many places in Vegas do it right. The server, warned me that it was a lot of food. He was not kidding! When the order arrived, there were four sections of the sandwich on the plate; garnished with fries. My chef friend said they cooked it correctly. The sandwich was double dipped in batter smothered with powdered sugar (although I could have used a lot more powder sugar-sweet tooth). It came with a side of raspberry sauce to dip the sandwich in. It was crispy on the outside and moist and warm on the inside layered with cheese, ham and turkey...It just melted in my mouth. So deliciously good. I have to come back and try other things on the menu. BTW: I had to take 1/2 the sandwich and fries home. Looking for a diner; stop by Metro diner."}
{"text":"Bravo Metro Diner!  Husband and I stumbled across this after a visit to Hand and Stone.  What a find. There was a bit of a wait, but totally worth it. We tend to like to sit at a counter and watch the team work together and this place was a true master kudos to that awesome group preparing both lunch and breakfast AND dinner at the same time. The hostess was cheerful, unflappable and genuinely happy we walked in. Our server at the counter, Austin was gracious and efficient. But the main attraction was the food. Really really good. Probably the best Huevos Rancheros I have ever had and I have had some amazing Huevos Rancheros in my day. Had the half order and still left some on my plate. Really big portions of EVERYTHING coming out of that kitchen. My husband had the Bold Burger and really enjoyed it. My only negative would be that his onion rings were only ok.  Being able to order Mimosas was the final touch.  Great job. Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"I officially have a new favorite breakfast spot. Visited the Pineville location of this restaurant on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. Before I made it out the door I had already planned my next visit and what I intended to eat. I have now visited twice and the second experience was just as good as the first.   Food:  The menu is big and so are the portions.  They have almost every classic diner dish you can think of. The difference is that there is something that elevates every dish and makes it better then you've ever experienced it. The Chicken and waffles for example is beyond perfect. They brine the chicken for about 18 hours before they will fry it. I watch a woman temp every piece of chicken she pulled out of the fryer to check for perfect doneness.  The skin is so crispy and delicious that even when I microwaved my leftovers, it was still perfectly crisp, (how do they do that?). I opted for a nutty waffle to accompany my chicken so they added almonds and pecans to it. Then my server came over and mixed spicy maple syrup together right at the table. The waffles had strawberry butter on top. The combination was sinful.  The huevos rancheros are amazing. The \"Yo Hala On The Square\" is one of their signature dishes and it definitely made me Challah...see what I did there? It's 2 slices of challah bread stuffed with bananas, brown sugar, cream cheese and hazelnut syrup, then prepared like french toast. Once plated it gets a generous helping of blueberry compote and sprinkled with powdered sugar. I almost lost my mind. The Charleston Shrimp and Grits are different from anywhere in town. Imagine shrimp, andouille  sausage, peppers and onions in a shrimp sauce poured over two grit cakes that are laced with cheese sau hisage and peppers and then garnish the whole thing with chopped bacon and green onion. The flavors meld together perfectly.  Service: Our server, Dana was amazing. She knew the menu inside and out and made great recommendations. My drink was magically full everytime I reached for it. My whole family had a great time. She even explained to us that there is a full self serve drink bar to take advantage of while waiting or on your way out. Overall it was an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast this morning both me and my boyfriend got pound cake French toast which was gross way to sweet shouldn't put any syrup on it , grits was okay, bacon was $3.99 for 3 slices , also we got two orange juices for $8 , asked for a refill and we were told it would be another charge for both refills( what a joke). The servers were constantly talking to a man and his child behind us which was super irritating (the whole time they were eating) and they were all standing in the front of Podium in front when we came in , felt claustrophobic, they were nice just a bit to much in your face. Most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Worst service that I've ever experienced. From the moment we walked in, the hostess never acknowledged us. They saw us waiting but seated a party that walked in right after us before us. When we were seated, we waited awhile for our server to even talk to us. Another party was seated after us and got their drink orders in before us. We waited forever for our food. Other groups of people came and left before we got our food. We had three cups of coffee while waiting forever for our food. Our server, along with the other workers hardly check on us. Even the manager never came to see if we needed anything. Our server came and asked if we wanted more coffee, we replied that we just wanted our food. She just said, I know but it's kind of busy.  We did see that it was busy but that doesn't explain why other groups that came after us already got their food and left. When one of our plates were done, our server grabbed it, but for some reason had someone else deliver it. 10 minutes after the first dish came, sever finally comes over and says that the manager will comp the last two dishes. No apologetic tone to it. Manager finally comes and talks to us, and again, not really an apologetic tone. We were there for over an hour and it was a bad experience. This place is ran chaotically. You hardly see smiles on the workers faces. Guy at the station continuously yelling, I need a runner. In my opinion, a good place would work as a team. Not expecting everyone else to do things for you. It doesn't matter what your title is, you do your job and help others when needed. I only saw two workers that actually worked hard. I would never dine here again."}
{"text":"Great new breakfast spot in Pineville. Sat outside on the patio and still got fantastic service. Decently priced for the amount of food you get. Chicken n waffles with the strawberry butter is what they're known for. So glad Metro Diner has a presence   in Charlotte now!"}
{"text":"Had take out from here tonight as I am sick and unable to go out. So my spouse picked up. This is my second experience with food from here. Great prices, big portions, and excellent food. Recipe for success. Go eat at Metro! It's worth your time and money! I will definitely be going more. I am thrilled that a new place opened up here in town that wasn't Asian or Mexican, we have an over abundance of that fare but I must confess that I really don't get tired of eating Asian food. I just feel like Huntersville needed something else to provide a wider selection and a new diner was a perfect fit."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, lots of options, reasonable prices.  It's a good place for family's, brunch, date night or a little reminder if home cooking without the work. The fried chicken is some of the best this southern has eaten. Make sure you arrive hungry since the portions are large. Expect a wait on the weekends but it's worth it.  I'm looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"2 stars for the food. Server offered us their breakfast special off the menu. So I got the cream cheese crepes with mixed fruits. When the server brought our orders, it was 3 rolled crepes with overloaded cream cheese fillings. Its very rich and I felt like I was eating a straight cream cheese bar. If you are a big cream cheese lover then its for you. Made me wanna vomit after eating half a roll. The service however is very good. 3 staffs came out asked me If I was ok and offered me to order something else. But, l already lost my appetite after having the sensation of vomiting so I refused to order different food. They took the crepes off of our bill which is nice of them."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Nice atmosphere as a diner from the past.  I had the best chicken pot pie I have ever eaten for a late lunch today."}
{"text":"We have dined in at this location a few times since it opened and also ordered pickup orders over the phone.  As far as the food goes it more than up to standard for Diner food and reasonably priced. Everything we have ordered there, both breakfast and dinner was satisfying. I watched the people working there and they are attentive with the customers, I did not see anybody working there ignoring customers. When I did the takeout orders, they said 15 minutes both times I ordered takeout, and they were right on time with the 15 minute mark , everything was boxed up the way its supposed to be and I liked that they kept the coleslaw separate from the hot items, and it was great coleslaw. The diner is a great addition to this part of town."}
{"text":"Eat here two days in a row. The Breakfast Pie is the best I have ever tasted. The wait staff was very nice.  Down side is it is a wait but that's just an indication of how good  the food is.  This will be my regular."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been for breakfast and dinner and have enjoyed it every time! I like the concept of a beverage bar but that the waiters still bring you a drink if you don't want to get your own. Their flavored coffees are always so good! The management is really a step above some they places and will take the time to chat with you, even if there is no problem. When there is an issue they really go above and beyond to correct it, was very surprised!!! The fried chicken, meatloaf, Reuben, smoked meat, all SO yummy! For breakfast you can't go wrong, lots of food and first choice in the area!"}
{"text":"You gotta give it a try! There is something for everyone on this menu!! Come hungry and be prepared to leave full!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! There was a lot of food served for the price which was awesome!!   Service was great, Finn- awesome server!!   Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I went to the same restaurant as everyone who wrote such positive reviews. This was terrible. Institutional food, too salty.   Decided to try this diner after hearing it was featured on Diners, Drive ins and Dives- have usually had good luck with restaurants featured on this show. After looking over the menu, everyone in my party was having second thoughts, but we decided to give it a chance.  Our waitress was friendly and brought our drinks. As soon as the food hit the table I knew we were not going to be very happy. Fish and chips are very salty and clearly frozen food. Corned beef hash was very poor quality.   Thirty minutes in, we were ready to leave, but had to wait awhile to get our check.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Not only was the food amazing but the service was excellent!! It was our first time and certainly won't be our last!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a seasoned eater and I am not ashamed to admit that. After viewing some pictures on Yelp we grabbed our stuff and headed straight here.  The service was excellent! We were greeted warmly, seated promptly and our waitress was so joyful. She welcomed us as first timers, explained the specials and gave us recommendations.  I wanted to try the Yohala but I also wanted... breakfast (I need savory and sweet). Without me asking she offered to try and sub a half order of the Yohala for my pancake for a buck. SCORE! My husband had the fried chicken and waffles. Our waitress mixed the sweet and spicy sauce (maple syrup and hot sauce) for his chicken and the strawberry butter that came with the waffles was delicious!  Everything tasted SO GOOD. I wasn't sure what quality the food would be but it was far and above any other 'diner' I've been to. I took the bananas out of the Yohala and it was perfect. My husband said his meal was better than Roscoe's.  We will definitely visit again on our next trip to Nevada."}
{"text":"I've been to Metro Diner quite a few times. I love their very mixed breakfast/lunch menu. Breakfast is my favorite though. I change it up every time I come which is rare when I go to eat at a place I've been to before. But I am never dissapointed.   I ordered a veggie omelet today and it was really good. Veggies were all fresh.   I asked for Andy to be my server. He's great and always is happy which makes the experience of dining here even better.   Anyways if you're looking for a place to eat with reasonable prices and excellent quality. Metro Diner is the way to go (and I've worked at a few breakfast places, so that's saying a lot)."}
{"text":"Horrible experience- would rate zero stars if possible based on the rude and lazy staff. Will not be back. Unfortunate too as we were excited to try it."}
{"text":"Second time at this location. Once for dinner and once for breakfast. Food and service is top notch. Always good for something different."}
{"text":"I really recommend this place for locals and non-locals. The atmosphere is very casual and and the service very friendly.   When they forgot to tell me that they were out of one of the blackboard specials, the strawberry crepes, I ordered my usual eggs benedict. When my order came, the manager came over and told us that it was on the house  because of the long wait. I really appreciated it because I wasn't really expecting it.   Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"The food was good and plentiful. The fact that my son could order mac and cheese while we had breakfast food was a big plus. The service was quick and friendly. Overall they really earned five stars."}
{"text":"Went unplanned for brunch with my brother and mother. We were in the are and googled places near by. It was quite busy, about a 15 min wait to be seated. Service was great, friendly staff hostess, and waitress.  Food was plentiful. Huge portion, everything was served to perfection. No complaints. I had the two eggs breakfast with bacon and grits. My mother had the chicken and waffles (she loved) and had plenty for a Togo box. My brother had the Swiss mushroom burger."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but the waffles were dry and the chicken tasted as though it was probably brined. Which I was not a fan as the chicken tasted overly salted and the texture was too soft for my liking. The strawberry butter was really good! My waitress was friendly but she kept touching me and it made me very uncomfortable. I understand hospitality but it's 2018 we should know by now that's it's not appropriate to touch strangers or touch people without their permission. It honestly gave me anxiety and made me want to finish and leave."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Great staff!!  The chicken and waffles are the best!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for the past 5 months and normally rave about the food. However, the last 3-4 times we have come here, the food has been horrible! Tonight, we ordered 4 burgers (3 medium and 1 well done). It took over 20 minutes to get our order and when we did, all of the burgers were over cooked and all of the food on our plates was cold. We do not blame the wait staff at all. They have always been phenomenal. However, the cook staff is getting worse and worse!!!! If management reads this review, please understand that your staff in the kitchen is causing these horrible reviews and would explain why the diner is not as busy as it should be. Your staff in the kitchen is more concerned about socializing than they are about the quality of food they are putting out. There is NO excuse for cold, over cooked food. If the quality continues to decline, we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Two visits here, back to back in fact, and I am definitely liking Metro!  First visit was during lunch with the coworkers - arrived 20 minutes before noon and was seated right away. I swear as soon as 12pm hit, it became super busy - all tables were filled! The staff were very friendly and had bubbly personalities! I ordered the 'Fried Chicken Plate', includes half a chicken - fried, mashed potatoes with gravy, grilled veggies and a biscuit. Dinner item for lunch, I know weird, but before ordering we kept seeing the chicken pass by and didn't want so much of the breakfast/lunch food, so that was the best bet. Definitely did not disappoint - chicken was super crispy and moist, mashed potatoes were buttery good, the grilled veggies were simple but nothing beats that grilled, charred taste, and those biscuits made from scratch daily, ughh *drool*! Also, had a side of onion rings.   Second visit was during dinner with family, it was SUPER packed! Informed a 15-20 minute wait, which wasn't too bad. Staff was still very friendly though! I decided to try the 'Chicken and Waffles with the Strawberry Butter'. I know I went opposite this time -- breakfast for dinner, lol! Chicken this time around was a bit salty. The waffles were perfectly crisp and that strawberry butter is amazing! Such a unique concoction!  Mom got the steak and eggs. TBH, we've had better - so this was just \"ok\" in our books. Stepdad got chicken fingers with fries. Brother got 'Bold City Burger', which has cheese, onions, bacon, sausage, jalape√±os, lettuce, tomato on a brioche bun - this was soooo good! ALOT to take in (literally) but the toasted bun with all the ingredients together takes this burger to the next level! A MUST TRY!  Very pleased with both visits and like I've mentioned before, I LOVE comfort type of foods! Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"This new joint is just up the street from us and we checked it out because of Diners, Drive Ins and Dives! First visit, we had the breakfast croissant sandwich, which was a huge portion and a side of hasbrowns! It was an okay meal can't complain. We also got the tomatoe bisque soup, the soup was very thick and had decent flavor, the service was great.   Second visit, I ordered the chicken fingers. The chicken fingers were so great! They chicken tasted real and very moist with real light reading."}
{"text":"Walking in we were greeting by very friendly wait staff. Seated straight away and greeted within seconds. Very friendly waiter called Shawn told us about specials and daily breakfast lunch and dinner. Drinks and food came out very fast and was delish. I had the San Fran Beni and my wife had the special strawberry cheesecake crepes, both were very tasty. We will definitely be coming back soon. Thank you Shawn and Metro Diner :-)"}
{"text":"Just had my first breakfast in Charlotte. Great food with huge portions. I had to take some food home for another meal. Friendly staff and food comes out quick."}
{"text":"Was here with my parents and we had enjoyed a good meal here. Chicken and waffles were so good! Place was somewhat busy and the employees here had a genuine smile on them. Really nice actually. Service was superb as well. Food was truly delicious here and I might be back here again soon."}
{"text":"I love this place  breakfast for dinner  meat loaf its all great  i would just say add regular black tea  we are now locals we will b back again!"}
{"text":"We enjoy this place a lot. Good service and good food. Their breakfasts are especially great. Keep up the good work. We have eaten at other Metro diners on the south side of town. We were thrilled to find this one in Hunterville."}
{"text":"Back again but finally got their wifi working with me. Briana was my server and she was great. Wife and I enjoyed her conversation and will return again. Ole.    Back yet another time. 6/28/18. The food is great as ever. Jamie our waitress is great and has a humor. Ole will be back."}
{"text":"First time was a success! Finn was wonderful, as so was everyone else. The food was delicious, the music was jammin', the only thing this place needs- is hazelnut and French vanilla creamer (; we shall be back, again and again, and again (: thank you Metro Diner!"}
{"text":"I love it I've been here several times I think the food is very good I think the prices are a little high but the portions are big and you can definitely share them"}
{"text":"I really like this place  the food and the  service is always good with  salli celebrating  my bday breakfast"}
{"text":"If you want a grandma-made biscuit with real chunky gravy, this is the place! Also, don't forget to get their eggs over easy -it's Peeeeerrrfect!  The truth is I'm not southern. But my friends told me that this is the bomb and it is! So rare to find good sausage gravy."}
{"text":"Went in today around 1:30 ish and it was pretty busy for a Tuesday 20 min wait. Our waiter was nice .. I ordered the steak and eggs, the steak was bland but the A1 gave it some like and the caramelized onions I ordered. The grits was tasty so I'd definitely  be back and try some other things out on the menu. I can say the wait didn't seem unbearable it went by quickly and they did a good job separating the eating area from the general seating."}
{"text":"Took my family here hoping for a nice outing and was excited because my supervisor has been demanding that I try this place. I was happy to see that this location opened up because it is closer to me than the other two locations in town.  Overall, the food was good with the exception of the fish and chips which were HORRIBLE. Small, thin, sad little pieces of fish with a weird texture. And the tartar sauce was just glorified relish. I couldn't bring myself to finish the dish.  We were seated promptly upon entering, but after that, the service was pretty terrible. One guy noticed we had been waiting awhile and announced that he wasn't actually our server, but would get us drinks. Ruby was our server and only came by our table to take our order and to take the bill. The first guy and bus boy checked on us more than she did. Plus she left me with the IPad after I paid instead of waiting the five seconds to wait for me to just sign and be done with it. Felt weird to be left with such important equipment. I also waited a good portion of time for her to bring the receipt, but it wasn't until I got fed up and started to walk out that she scurried over to our table and handed my mother the receipt.  I will give them 2 stars because the rest of the staff was AMAZING! People got the door for us and even though this first guy wasn't our server, he went out of his way to help us out.  I know this diner is new and they are still probably trying to figure things out, but I feel disappointed considering it has rave reviews from everyone else. I feel jipped."}
{"text":"Really had a very good breakfast  Menus was solid and just enough different to make no memorable   Would go again next tome in the area"}
{"text":"\"Where the Locals Eat\"  Those words are printed on the front of the menu.  Since I'm a local, I guess I should eat there!  I had read good reviews and heard wonderful things about this restaurant.  When I was invited by Stefany V to have brunch, I immediately jumped at the chance.    I had arrived on a Saturday around 10:30.  I was able to get seated immediately for the start of my dining experience.   I noticed that on their giant specials board hung on the back wall French Vanilla Coffee was their brew for the day.  My black coffee with vanilla flavor was delicious.  I always love a great cup of coffee.  Stefany and I decided to split the Charleston Shrimp & Grits along with the Heuvos Rancheros.  Oh man.  Two choices that I am thankful for.  Both dishes are very large.  Even with being split by two we still had leftovers.  Shrimp & Grits is one of my favorite dishes to eat.  The grits are made into two fried cakes infused with cheese, roasted red peppers and andouille sausage.  It's then topped with a gravy like sauce with shrimp, sausage, onion and peppers.  It was creamy and popping with flavor.  I recommend this desirable dish ten times over.  Our first plate of Huevos Rancheros was missing the egg.  But they were quick to correct their mistake with a new plate delivered in no time.  Their version reminded me more of Chilaquiles.  The tortillas surrounding the mound of ingredients were fried like a large tortilla chip.  It was perfect to pile on the toppings of chorizo, black beans, onions and peppers.  Of course there were your normal salsa, cheese and sour cream topping as well.  I did love how they used tempura battered jalape√±os.  That gave it a nice kick and crunchiness.   We received attentive and friendly service from our amazing waiter.  I had a top notch experience at Metro Diner.  I hope to be back soon for more!"}
{"text":"So much food!  Wow.  Good breakfast again.  Sat at the bar interacted with the cooks. We had the 12\" metro pancake, 2 egg, meat, hash brown platter. Side of gravy biscuit was a large serving. Will return."}
{"text":"Came here because we saw they served Fried Chicken and Waffles and they had awesome reviews.   Our order:  FRIED CHICKEN AND WAFFLE Half a fried chicken and a Belgian waffle topped with a sweet, strawberry butter and served with our signature sweet and spicy sauce.  YO HALA ON THE SQUARE Two thick slices of challah bread stuffed with a mixture of bananas, brown sugar, cream cheese and hazelnut syrup, prepared like French toast. Topped with a blueberry strawberry compote!  Servings can totally be shared. We should have just ordered the chicken/waffle because we were STUFFED. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The waffle was good. I wasn't a big fan of the strawberry butter, but the bf LOVED it.   The Hala was practically dessert. It was super sweet. It was really good though. Too sweet to be breakfast. Good for sharing."}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time. Cute place, friendly wait staff. Food came out fast and hot. I had the Pot Roast with mashed potatoes and veggies, the meat was tender and pretty tasty but I wasn't real crazy about the juice it was in. It should have been more of a gravy but it tasted like an au jus. Veggies were tender and nothing really to be remembered but the mashed potatoes were pretty good at least. I gave it a 4 star since  I've only been there once and would like to go back to try the meatloaf since they were out.  The place was nice and clean, bathrooms were spotless and when we arrived the place was quite busy. We were seated right away and only waited about 30 seconds before our drink order was taken.  I believe this place will be a nice little addition to that area. We don't seem to have many diners on this side of town anymore."}
{"text":"Fried chicken and waffles yo. That's all you need to know. It's going to change your life."}
{"text":"Visited Metro Diner 9/18/17 and had their chicken and waffle. For the first time I can say I enjoyed eating this meal. I have tried it at various locations but have never been blown away like I was this time around. The chicken is marinated for 24hr giving a fantastic savory and salty taste with great texture. The waffle was prepared well, but what took this platter to  another level was the strawberry butter. The mixture between the saltiness and crunch of the chicken, paired with the sweet and fluffy waffle, followed by the soft fresh butter created, a mouth full of orgasmic flavors and textures. I will definitely return and highly recommend to others. Furthermore, their portions are very friendly."}
{"text":"Really solid breakfast for bacon, eggs, pancakes and toast. No really stand outs nor disappointments.   The atmosphere is neo-cafe that is a touch of old school with faux artist flare.  The service was very friendly and kind.  While there was no wait for sitting, the wait for the food was rather long. However, I don't know how many orders was before ours. I mean we could a come rather at the end of a rush....  I will revisit to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Food  was pretty good. Hospitality was off the charts. They took care of us and that's worth coming back!"}
{"text":"Second time eating here and what really made the experience great was our server Melissa! Super awesome down to earth girl and great waitress! My veggie wrap with fried jalape√±os was pretty tasty, maybe next time I'll try the chicken and waffles and definitely ask for Melissa too! :)"}
{"text":"Family breakfast at Metro Diner,  very good again, crowded but we got sat quickly, the chicken and waffles were excellent, the Oscar omelette was good also. Huge portions."}
{"text":"What's all the hype about the cheese steak? I mean it was okay but not that great . In Utah there's a place called the Italian place that is a hundred times better and you can get a huge sandwich for $10 and share it and not have to tip a server. I got the pastrami sandwich that had an egg on it and cheese and coleslaw. I didn't realize that it had Fry's on it too. I'm sorry but it just wasn't very good .  The bread was not toasted at all. It was these big slices of bread with all this stuff on it so it was really hard to eat. The Fry's that were on the sandwich were squished soggy and cold. The egg on the sandwich was cold . It did lot of meat on it though, but it has this really strong flavor like it it's been brining forever. I didn't get any mustard for the pastrami and the waitress didn't even ask me if I wanted any. Who eats pastrami without mustard ? Then my husband realized that he's lost his wallet and we had to leave. The waitress brought us our containers to put our food in and then I went up front because we were in a hurry and I didn't want to have to wait for her to get my credit card. She finally came up there and ran my card then left me standing there with the paperwork that I had signed and I had to wait for someone to come back up there to get it. So I tipped her $1 less then I was going to. I mean if she is going to leave me standing there when she knew I had an emergency then tough luck your not getting much of a tip from me. Seriously people if Guy Fieri's going to endorse your restaurant and live up to it!"}
{"text":"Wife and I ate at grand opening.  Nothing to complain about.   Great food and service"}
{"text":"I love breakfast food, and was happy to find this place in Henderson, on my business trip there. I have eaten at my local location a couple of times and had excellent service and food. Their portions are a little larger than I want, but you will not go home hungry. I found that their breakfast sandwiches are just the right amount of food, and so very tasty. I was happy to find that the same great food and service was also at this location. I think, I prefer the Richmond location, the Henderson location lived up to my high expectations. Thanks for a good experience far from home."}
{"text":"Henderson is a good place for diners.....and Diners. We're not so much for the fancy stuff. I very much appreciate Metro's decor, which harkens back to the original diners. enjoyed the chicken-fried steak and the hash. I wouldn't get the pot pie again, as they use rolled-out biscuit dough as crust. The best crust (and a flaky one) for pot pies is James Beard's recipe, which uses egg yolks as an enrichment. There will be plenty left over to take home. The waitpersons are trippy and very helpful. One day I asked for mashed potatoes....and they didn't have any...is that unforgivable for a diner? Stuck with fries again. I will definitely be trying their stuffing waffles sometime soon. We'll be getting a Metro Diner on Serene at Eastern (near WalMart and Home Depot), which will attract a lot of people down off the hill."}
{"text":"Got a $10 coupon here so we decided to check it out and it's around the corner.  Ordered a pot pie and Ruben.. The pot pie was under cooked,  dough was still raw. The Ruben was ok but drenched in thousand island.  Our server and manager was very nice. Mayb we'll give it another try some day.."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Metro Diner is a wonderful addition to Henderson!   I've visited on several occasions to try out the delicious menu.  Every meal has been wonderful.  The Charleston Shrimp & Grits is my favorite.  The roasted red pepper grit cakes are topped a delicious shrimp and sausage sauce.  It's a very generous dish with always leftovers to take home.    The Metro Club is also a nicely done sandwich with the amount of meat and ingredients piled into it.  It's lightly toasted bread tries to hold together the mile high sandwich.  I opted to try the Mac & Cheese with the sandwich.  It's decadent and creamy.  I would absolutely order it again as a good side dish.    Seriously the service here is so friendly.   Our drinks are always filled and multiple staff members check on our dining experience.  They truly seem to pride themselves on providing wonderful service to their patrons.  I am so delighted they are so close to home.  I look forward to many many more visits!"}
{"text":"The food (I had the fried chicken plate), was very good. I love the simple, yet delicious sweet heat sauce with the chicken. Our server did great, food and dessert were perfect, so I have no complaints, only compliments. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love love love it here!!! Service was amazing. The employees are very friendly. I had the avocado toast, with eggs and turkey sausage. Everything was fresh and cooked to perfection. The portions were huge! I also tired the French vanilla coffee and it tasted great.   I also tried the waffle with strawberry's and crab Benedict. Both were very light and delicious!!!!   The menu has variety. I most definitely want to return and try more items. Thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"So after reading the rave reviews of how good the food and service Metro Diners are known for throughout the U.S, I was curious to see what was all the fuss about this chain. Honestly, it's just a step up from Denny's. Their menu items offered here is better, ambiance is nicer, but that's just about it.  Came here couple times over the past few months, hoping I'd find something I can be excited about and tried different dishes each time. Nothing memorable to me, well, except pass on the grits here, the texture and taste are off. trust me.  Mr B loves their Monte Cristo. I had liked it too. But that last visit, it was heavy on the grease. The jam that it's served with was good too. I assumed it was made from scratch from what I read. But when I asked our server for more, she looked and pointed to the packaged jellies on our table and said just open those, they're the same thing. Okaay.  Service is friendly. Nothing more or less. It was on point when the servers had their trainers hovering over them. Last two visits, got seated right away, but it took more than five minutes for a server to acknowledge our existence. Plus they were forgetful.   And whoever was the lead giving their employees evaluations, should use a little more discretion. Like do not do the employee evals at the boothes with patrons within earshot. Real tacky.  Employee got rated 3 cause she \"needs to smile more\"... which may be true, but how about how unprofessional evaluator was? I didn't need to hear that.   Metro Diner still on the list to visit, just not as enthusiastic as others are."}
{"text":"Metro is a solid diner- I pop in solo, snag a seat at the bar, and watch the cook make my food hot and fresh. The service puts this business above others in that they are attentive almost to a fault. My server will help me and nearly every other server who walks by will check my water, ask how I'm doing, or suggest dishes if I'm still looking at a menu. It's unreal, in a great way!  Always check the black board for specials- a recent crab cake benedict was bomb, but the stuffing waffle Thanksgiving special wsa most memorable. It's one of those places where you can't really go wrong. Somehow I haven't managed to try many of the dinner dishes, but I love that you can have meatloaf for breakfast or scrambled eggs for dinner, because it's all available all the time!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner for the first time and we had one of the best, stick to your ribs, NY chicken fried steak dinners EVER! Thanks to our AMAZING server, AVERYANNA, who recommended this dish to us! As always, 100% satisfied with the service and food!"}
{"text":"Wow! That hit the spot. Stopped by for a late breakfast and they were packed but I was seated immediately and served by a great server within 3 minutes of being seated. Food showed up in ten or twelve minutes and everything was delicious. Manager stopped by to make sure everything was okay. There is some kind of magic dust in the waffles. I heard violins after my first bite. I could observe the kitchen from my seat and those pros were like a machine. Grits were average but the eggs were fluffy, the bacon was crispy and the whipped butter on the waffle was perfect.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"If I had another choice I wouldn't even give it a 1 star. The wait was way to long after we ordered and the food was aweful. We left without even finishing our food it was so bad. This place won't last and gas no business being in Las Vegas. Good riddens."}
{"text":"Very clean place...excellent service...food is delicious!  I'm definitely coming back. Had the fried chicken plate. My partner had the chicken waffles. They had shrimp and grits on the menu.  Will need to try that next time around. Would love to try their chicken pot pie as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Second visit and couldn't be more impressed.  I ordered the shrimp and grits this time around.  Dad had the pot roast.  Mom had the fish and chips.  My partner had the chicken plate.  Friendly people and very fast service.  We had our food in front of us within 15-20 mins of being seated.  Dad said his pot roast was soft and tender.  My shrimp and grits was savory.  Mom's fish was crispy, but the fries were a bit on the salty side.  My partner's chicken plate did not disappoint.  Love this place and would absolutely, strongly recommend."}
{"text":"My mother and I came here for breakfast on a Saturday, we were seated promptly and given a choice of coffee. I got the flavored coffee of the day and my mom got the regular stuff...we checked out the daily specials board and decided to split the Key Lime Pie stuffed waffle and then took a while longer to find something \"not sweet\" as our other item to split (2 egg breakfast to the rescue). Eggs were a perfect over easy, hash browns were crispy, bacon was done just the way I like it (biscuit was a little dry)...the stuffed waffle??? An entire Belgian waffle with an entire slice of key lime pie (with the crust), waffle then folded on top of the pie and then covered in a glorious raspberry sauce! Omg...such good food and the service was excellent, the kitchen was moving like a well oiled machine! Will definitely be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch with a coworker...was seated very quickly (not many people in restaurant). Guy walked by and seemed surprised to see us, greeted us and got us our waters. Then a female server walked by introduced herself, etc. Obviously, not her section but she was real nice and friendly and will be our server. My co-worker ordered the crab cake Benedict and I got the Monte Cristo...she loved hers and ate the whole thing, I loved mine but only ate half in order to take home the other half (the onion rings were awesome). We were mostly left to our own devices which is good as I don't like servers who hover, but I did feel a little rushed at the end and sitting a bit longer than usual to be greeted is my reason for 4 stars. Food was awesome, service overall very good!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  From the service of the employees, quickness the food came out and quality of the food!  Our waiter was Dario (not sure how to spell) and he was very friendly and asked us about our day, and complimented our novelty t shirts. He also educated us on the custom drinks and specials of the day and how their menu works. He was able to describe every ingredient of the items and was very enthusiastic about the chicken & waffles and corned beef & hash.   When you first walk in it seems like a long wait for a small place but they definitely surprised us.   My boyfriend got the Holy Davoli burger which is a burger smashed between two grilled cheeses with bacon and lettuce slaw. - very unique   It was pretty inexpensive for good food too. Our waiter was also not the only nice one, they were all nice from the conversations I could hear other waitress' having.   Will for sure be back again."}
{"text":"Stop in for breakfast on a Sunday and the place was very busy. But the great thing was that the wait was not to bad. The menu has a great selection to choose from and the staff is friendly and the food was good. Thankfully it is close to home so we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Tried Metro out as wife said this place had great reviews and it was a brand new place. Hosts were nice and it was a short wait to get seated as it didn't look like they were too busy (Sunday afternoon).   After being seated we had to wait an extremely long time (~10 mins) before we were greeted by a server. Guy was very nice, took our drinks, and let us know that our actual server will check on us soon. During this wait we overheard the table next to us asking for a manager to complain about the service. Honestly, this should have been our first red flag. After waiting ANOTHER 5-10 mins our actual server showed up and took our orders. She didn't know how to work the ordering tool that well which was strange (Place just opened. Didn't you get trained?).  For the drinks, I tried the sweetened peach tea and it was super (extremely) sweet. Mixed it half and half with wife's water and it was still a bit too sweet but very tasty.  For the food, I got the Monte Cristo with chips which was excellent in taste and portion. The berry sauce it came with was equally amazing. I would recommend that dish if you're going to come here.   The wife got the fish and chips which were terrible. I thought she was exaggerating so I tried some but they really were awful. The fish were soggy on the outside instead of crispy, they were totally bland and the tater sauce tasted more like relish in a cup. Would not recommend that dish to anyone. My wife just ended up having part of my Monte Cristo and left almost the entirety of the fish and chips.   Mother-in-law got the bacon mushroom swiss burger with fries. She said the burger was extremely good but the fries were already cold when they reached the table. Brother-in-law got the bold city burger which he said was excellent (and looked excellent) but same issue with the fries.  During the meal we were checked up on by a few people, none of which were our server. Unfortunately no one refilled waters or sodas even once during the meal. The original person who took our drinks left the check for us which is weird (where is our server?). After finishing we waited another 5 minutes after the bus boy took our plates before the server sort of stumbled passed our table, noticed we were done, and asked us if we wanted a box for the fish and chips and took our payment.  In the end, this was a disappointing experience. The burgers and sandwiches may be good but a lot of work needs to be done with the service and I don't know how they could possibly fix the disgrace that they call their fish and chips.  Tl;Dr Service was bad. Burgers and sandwiches were good and the only thing that saved the meal. Fish and chips were a disgrace."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant recently for lunch with coworkers. We were seated quickly and taken good care of through out our meal. The portions were large and right on target with the price. I had the Charleston Shrimp and Grits. It came with 2 grits cakes instead of traditional grits but they were full of flavor. They were in a plate full of gravy, andouille sausage and shrimp. Wish there was a bit more shrimp, and maybe a little less gravy but other than that it was fantastic. I also had mango sweetened tea, very tasty and refreshing! It is pretty loud in there and I felt like the stay was trying to rush us a bit when we stayed to chat awhile after our meal. They were friendly but definitely got the feeling they were needing the table. Great new addition to the Southwest area! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Go for the Chicken and waffles, everything looks great.  Expect you may leave with leftovers.  Great choice for all ages. Very crowded on weekends, go early"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood at lunch time, and had heard good things from a couple of friends, so I thought I would give Metro Diner a try. The ambience is typical old-school Diner Ambience with lots of booths and specials written on a Blackboard on the far wall. The menu is pretty much breakfast and lunch Comfort Foods with nothing really exciting. Breakfast has lots of waffles pancakes and omelettes. Lunch menu has hamburgers and salads. I went with a western omelette. The Omelette was large and filled with typical western omelette goodies. It had a very tasty salsa on the side. I got a side of cut up fruit for a $0.50 up charge. Overall it was a filling tasty meal with pleasant service. If I lived in the neighborhood I probably would go back. But there's certainly nothing special about this Diner that would make me want to travel to it."}
{"text":"In from Cleveland, OH and tried Metro Diner on a whim. I'm considering myself lucky that we did!   In our party of 5 everyone had something different and it was all equally delicious!  The sausage gravy & biscuits came with 2 eggs and hash browns. Definitely enough for 2 people and the flavors and cook was perfect!  Most perfectly cooked hash browns I've ever had. The breakfast burger was amazing and again cooked perfectly, especially the egg, right amount of yolk running when bit into. The Philly cheesesteak was exceptional and very large. I can't wait to visit again. Definitely a 5 star"}
{"text":"I was a fan of this restaurant, but when hubby saw the cook drop a plate which broke on the cook top and the guy didn't throw away the food cooking on it, we decided not to return. Hope no one wound up eating a ceramic shard. Yikes!"}
{"text":"Kyle was my server very very pleased! The food was great I ordered the chicken and waffles! Plus the bathrooms are clean too !  good job Kyle !!!!"}
{"text":"What a difference this visit was!!! We we're seated immediately. Sean gave us a personable greeting and brought our drinks. He took our order and we received our food very quickly. Our service was excellent which we had grown accustomed to at this restaurant! When he noticed our drinks getting low, he brought new ones without us needing to ask. I believe that he met Metro Diner's service standards.  When the Metro Diner management read our last poor review they immediately reached out and wanted to make it right. We really appreciated their effort and really made up for poor last visit.   Fantastic food and exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Really good. 20 min wait but worth it. Waitresses were spot on. Answered every and substitution request immediately. Got the eggs benedict with avocado and hash browns, subbed turkey sausage links. It looked exactly like the pic, that's rare. Clean, comfy. Just overall great experience."}
{"text":"Such good food, TONS OF FOOD! Perfect service! Hannah from Hawaii was amazing and treated us as if we were the only customers in a full restaurant. Really great place! We will be back! Thank you Hannah!!"}
{"text":"Being from the East Coast, finding a \"good\" Diner out here is as hard as hitting a keno progressive. This place has really good food. My husband and daughter are obsessed with their Chicken and Waffles with Strawberry Butter, my personal favorite is the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict. The location is good, the restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly and the kitchen is quick.  The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wasn't a fan of the Brown Gravy...  French Fries with Brown Gravy is a staple to any true diner!!"}
{"text":"Well I'm going to have to describe my experience here,  service (Steven our server) was excellent, the atmosphere is very welcoming, our food came out pretty quickly. And I'd post a picture of our food, but it it would look like they brought is a plate right out of the dishwasher. And I can't say more to that!"}
{"text":"Was so excited because Metro Diner opened up near our home, and I was craving a good homemade meatloaf. After hearing the slogan \"where locals eat\", we heightened our expectations and headed to eat here on Monday.   The location has great decor and atmosphere, with checkered floors and big booths. Business was perfectly busy (steady, but not overcrowded), and it smelt like heaven when we opened the front doors. We were immediately greeted and sat down very quickly.  The menu is extensive with so many home-style options. I felt overwhelmed because everything sounded so delicious, and everyone around me really seemed to be enjoying their meals immensely.   I came with my boyfriend, and we decided to order three entrees and three sides. We settled for the meatloaf plate, the chicken pot pie, and the pastrami sandwich on rye. For sides we ordered the onion rings, the mac n cheese, and homemade potato chips (meatloaf comes with mashed potatoes & gravy too).  Everything came out together looking delicious, and steaming hot! We were so excited to eat we started attacking the food without direction. I went for the meatloaf first and absolutely adored it. I had asked the server to request the chef burnt my meatloaf and they actually listened!  My meatloaf was burnt to perfection, and one of the best meatloaf plates I have ever tried.   The mashed potatoes and gravy were a perfect side, and I almost forgot I had two more entrees, and three sides to try! My boyfriend was loving the Pastrami, so I went on to try the Chicken Pot Pie. The top crust stayed dry from the gravy making it a perfect accompaniment to dip into the sauce/chicken/vegetable melody. It was cooked perfectly, and an entree I would recommend/order again.  I went on to try our three sides. The homemade potato chips were seasoned perfectly, and not overly oily. The Mac n Cheese was creamy and extremely hearty, but perfectly flavorful. The onion rings were under-seasoned and really boring....I would much prefer fresh onion strings!   I snagged a bite of the Pastrami sandwich from my boyfriend, and pressured him to try the meatloaf. He \"highly dislikes\" meatloaf, and I was excited to hear his critique. He actually enjoyed it, and commented on how the burnt edges added a great texture element (score!). The Pastrami was soooooo delicious, and I understood why my boyfriend was hoarding it. We continued to munch till we were overly full, and could not even consider the dessert menu.   The table next to me got the Grilled 3 Cheese Sandwich with added tomato, and it also looked phenomenal. It was oozing with cheese, and toasted golden. I would consider ordering this next time, as well as trying the Monte Cristo or Pittsburgh Steak Salad.   The Monte Cristo is \"Fried sourdough sandwich stuffed with turkey, ham, cheddar and American cheese, topped with powdered sugar and served with raspberry preserves and your choice of side\". Sounds like heart attack waiting to happen, but executed to perfection and truly looked worth the indulgence. The Pittsburgh Steak Salad sounded up the same alley, being mainly a steak frite & french fry affair.   Overall amazing experience at Metro Diner, with awesome ambiance and killer food. I cannot wait to go back and try more of their dishes!   When you think diner, this is what you should envision (not Dennys, Ihop, Applebees, Chilis, etc;) Bringing back old school ambiance of fresh food, affordable pricing, and great service.   A+"}
{"text":"I went for the first time Wednesday February 20th 2018 , heard such great reviews , I walked in at 9:45 for a fantastic breakfast and was told to sit wherever I liked , sat down in the section with the most people to make sure I didn't put the waitress out , I sat and waited for service , I was in between 4 other people and waited , after 15 minutes of being ignored I was very upset , the waitress came to tables all around me but never acknowledged me, didn't offer a menu or coffee , I finally got so discouraged I got up and left , I stopped at the hostess station and waited another 4 minutes to express my displeasure , I was told sorry , I told the lady it was my first and last time !! It wasn't even busy and I was ignored , I've never been so embarrassed to try to do business with a local restaurant , will never go back !!! If I could give minus 2 Stars I would !"}
{"text":"1st star: Super friendly service. I've been in a few times now and I've yet to have a server that isn't anything short of awesome. They make menu suggestions, offer constant drink refills, and generally anticipate your needs very well. I've experienced a few errors with billing and orders but they're typically resolved quickly and with a smile. Management is visible and they're happy to talk about the company and expansion plans. Expect 4 Vegas locations by 2018!  2nd star: Their famous chicken and waffles. Thick, beautiful waffles topped with an amazing strawberry butter and accompanied by a huge, juicy half chicken with a delightfully crispy skin. This would be my go-to and it can easily serve two.  3rd star: Shrimp & Grits and Huevos Rancheros, my other two go-to dishes. The S&G is their own take on the classic dish, with fried grits patties topped with a tasty cream gravy and ample shrimp. The HR is more of a chilaquiles dish with crispy tortilla chips, lots of salsa and sour cream, and crispy fried jalapenos. Don't forget the over-med egg!  4th star: The rest of the menu is huge, from sweet french toasts (Yohala!) to salads, sandwiches, and dinner entrees (Ma, the meatloaf!). It really does meet their \"where the locals eat\" motto, offering dishes for every time of day and every preference. Always check their specials board. Looking forward to a West side location near me!"}
{"text":"It was sooooo good! I'd never been before and John was so helpful and pointed out the best thing in the menu...chicken and waffles. John was a wonderful waiter and super friendly and the food was amazing! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"First time at the Metro Diner, it was for breakfast, OUTSTANDING.  The service was excellent, a very comfortable environment , you can eat at the counter, at a table or a booth.  The menu has plenty of items to choose from.  My wife is from back east, New Jersey and she always says how much she misses Diner's with their variety of good comfort food \"home cooking\" it looks like Metro is it.  Next time it's the chicken and waffles for me, i saw several people who had them....looked delicious.  Looking forward to many many more visits.  Oh yeah the price is right very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff and we will return.  If you want a salad or comfort food, metro diner has it"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for brunch. They have a huge selection on their menu. The waiter was training a new waitress and he was very informative. The food was good but the portions were huge. (Not a complaint as I had left overs for lunch lol) I've noticed they are putting up a few more locations and I will definitely be visiting the ones in my area."}
{"text":"Softball rain delay so headed to Metro for some breakfast.  Fast service, great people and food quality and quantity was awesome.   Would definitely recommend if up around the area and looking for quality, well priced food."}
{"text":"Hazelnut coffee & crab cake bene!  Laura was a sweetheart and totally made my request for side strawberries and pineapple happen  big on starting my morning off right so metro diner is a place I'll be visiting more frequently! Thanks Laura !"}
{"text":"Soft opening today and we got reservations! I had the Yo Halla on the Square - amazing!   I'm usually a protein breakfast girl, but had to try this. I was not disappointed!!  Hubby had the chicken & waffles and he was equally impressed, even saying that it was the best fried chicken in Charlotte!!  Keep up the great job, Metro Diner! We will be back to see you again soon!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the hubs birthday on 1/25,first timer.The food had a lot of flavor like no other I tasted in a long time - Charleston shrimp and grits, pot pie, turkey dinner,chicken fried steak, fruity waffle. Going back for sure to eat more of the delicious food"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here last night for the second time and everything was perfect. Chris was our server and he greeted us in like 10 seconds. That had to be a record. He was patient with me, since I'm so indecisive and my bf is always giving me hell for that. He went over the specials which I wasn't interested in. Though he did mention the mango tea which was awesome. Anywho, the food was great, service was beyond what we expected, and we left in a food coma. We will be back for sure. And I've never gone to a restaurant and sought out a server but I'd really like Chris again. He was that good. Thanks Metro Diner for coming to our area!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the food was subpar. Service was friendly but not helpful. I hoped this restaurant would be a success."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, very tasty . I had the fish and chips that was nice and steamy hot very fresh . As soon as they got there they opened the door . Very friendly staff and waiters. The eggs bencidect was declious the best I have had . I can't wait to go again and recommend this to anyone . Thanks !!!"}
{"text":"This place feels like home. The people are friendly, the food comes out fast and filling! This is our 2nd visit - to a second location lol. Can't wait for their 3rd location to open - it's down the street from our house and we're super excited. Metro Diner has become our new favorite. The only downside - we wish they were open later. But we'll be ok - just keep serving delicious food!"}
{"text":"I have had breakfast and dinner at this location, and although the food is really good from what I have experienced, I witnessed a waitress encounter I will never forget. I dropped my wife off for a dentist appointment this week and decided to pop in and have some breakfast.  I was at the end of the row, and there was a couple of ladies with their kids further up the isle.  Then a woman and a guy sat down in front of me. The waitress, well I will just refer to her as \"Melissa\".  The woman in front of me started talking to the guy she was with, as \"Melissa\" was taking the ladies/kids order.  \"Melissa\" was rubbing her hand all over her face.  I saw her too, it was not an appropriate thing to be doing in the middle of this isle, as we were all prepared to have breakfast.  That is a bathroom moment.  It was not a few second thing either, she was acting like she was trying to stop a dripping nose, because her hand kept wiping her nose area, and then her mouth.  So the woman in front of me was quiet about it, but I saw her attempt to say something to \"Melissa\" quietly at the drink station.  I say it was quiet, because I couldn't hear her, she leaned in to speak to \"Melissa\", but it was the waitresses reaction that struck me.  She proceeded to go tell all the other waitresses about that conversation,  it was really obvious.  She would say something, look over at this poor lady who was sitting at the table, and then the next waitress would stare at the, guess who, the lady in front of me.  That was tact-less. A younger gal came over and told the woman in front of me that she would have a new server named Becky.  The woman in front of me was nice about all this, I heard her tell the gal that it was inappropriate that \"Melissa\" was touching the menus, dishes, and anything else, and didn't wash her hands, and that she shouldn't be touching her face at all near customers.  I totally agree.  She said \"Melissa\" told her that she did go wash her hands at the station before handling anything, but I was there, and no, she did pick up the menus and drinks.  So now this gal was trying to tell the customer she didn't see what she saw? That was not okay.  I wanted to say something, but I didn't. I should have. But \"Melissa's\" behavior over the issue was like a kid who got caught with their pants down and they get all hissy with the kids who saw it happen.  She should have apologized to this woman.  I saw her.  She did wipe her nose area several times and then immediately pick up the menus and went about her other duties. I may decide to eat there one more time, not sure yet..  But I will not be sitting in \"Melissa's\" station.  And if the waitresses are allowed to handle situations badly like she did, I will not give them another chance after that."}
{"text":"Exceptional food! We had the shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles and the ohala French toast! Omg the French toast! A++"}
{"text":"The most amazing fried chicken and waffles I've ever had !!! The staff is excellent!! Rashaun and Jewels took excellent care of us and went above and beyond !!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in besides the immediate friendly greeting you get a punch in the face by the sweet sweet smell of maple syrup!! Omg... It had my mouth totally drooling!  Almost every single review that I read mentioned the amazing service and I gotta tell ya... They were correct! The service was ahhhhhmazing! My server today was Finn and she was totally on point! From refilling our drinks to checking on us about the quality of the food to getting us to go drinks because it was really HOT outside today to giving up extra napkins to well pretty much anything else that you would expect. She was right there! 5/5 and the hostess was on point as well. She greeted us right away and when I asked for booth... They only had one open since it was 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed... Another person promptly jumped in and said... I'll go wipe it down for you guys right away! And literally within an minute or 2... We were sat with menus. Such great service!  My bf ordered the all American burger which came with a mayo based lettuce slaw and pickle spear on the side and a side of Mac n cheese. He said he wasn't hungry but he scarfed that thing like it was going outta style! He ordered it well done... He said they it was still very juicy which to me is mind blowing cuz anytime I've ever tasted a well done burger.... Well they normally are like trying to swallow sandpaper. Dry and scratchy. Which in my book is always YUCK. But his was juicy and seasoned just right and that's why it gets a 5/5. And the Mac and cheese... To die for!! So creamy! 5/5  I ordered the chicken and waffles dish and it comes with a sweet and spicy sauce... Little did I know that it was made table side... Finn came by and explained what it was...Their Maple syrup with some of the Louisiana hot sauce mixed in... And then proceeded to make it at the table for me to do my chicken in. So cute! I ended up adding more of the hot sauce... And it was a perfect condiment to my chicken.  Onto the chicken...ok... It's been a while since I had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's in Cali... But I gotta tell ya... The chicken here was pretty darn close! It was crunchy on the outside and omg so juicy and flavorful! If I had to guess... I'm going to say that they brine their chicken cuz it had so much flavor and the juice just leaking out of the meat! 5/5 I will definitely be back to get this chicken!!!  The waffles on the other hand were not that great... They were crunchy on the outside but it lacked flavor even with the strawberry butter. But really I didn't care at this point cuz the chicken was like WOWZA!! 3.5/5  I also got the sweet and spicy chicken tender sandwich. This a perfectly cooked chicken tender on a house made biscuit! This biscuit was to die for. It was so crunchy on the outside and yet so fluffy and soft in the center! And yes the chicken was amazeballs as well. Very crunchy on the outside and so juicy and tender inside. Totally get it again. 5/5  It was a very cute little joint. They had a black chalkboard that had their specials on it and their specials rotate from breakfast, lunch and dinner. And their kitchen was open as well so if you wanted to you could look in and watch them cook. As we were getting ready to go...I sat one of the staff members cleaning the floors with a wet Swiffer.  Very clean but it did get a little loud at points... But hey... Good food always seems to draw up more lively conversations! Lol 5/5  There is outside seating with fans but it's definitely still too hot to enjoy this facet of the diner.  They did a great job on dinner classics. Definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The service was off today. We came in for lunch with a 15 min wait witch is common. Unfortunately, our party of 4 ordered and all but one meal showed up. After 20 mins still not food or a reasonable response from management. We have been here on many occasions without any issues. I had high expectations when I arrived today however that is now not the case. I sure hope it improves the next time. Becky the manager was very polite and apologetic. Would I go back yes. Food was good service not so much."}
{"text":"First time and I promise it won't be the last. Absolutely delicious. The fried chicken and waffles are to die for. And a monte cristo? I haven't found a good place that makes them but now I did."}
{"text":"Great service! Deanne was awesome.  She made some great suggestions for dinner and they were spot on. The Charleston Shrimp and Grits was delicious. She made sure we were taken care even though she was quite busy.  The other waitstaff checked to see how everything was and if we needed anything also.  Great first experience, we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"First time, long time wanting to visit. Sunday 815 am. Walked in greeted right away and seated. Server took order on a wireless tablet. Coffee water and mostly eggs this morning with breakfast. Then we waited......and waited. So much so that we finished our coffee. Our server came by to check on us and said\" oh no food yet\"? I'm sorry I'll check. And I'll get you more coffee. Server came by and apologized for late food, said the wireless device did not work properly.  We waited some more. Food finally came as expected hot and fresh and tasted good. BUT not worth the wait. It's eggs and the coffee should not run dry at breakfast. Sorry! Decor is nice and fresh. Diner is clean, lots of folks working. Will I return. Maybe, but lots of competition for breakfast. Two stars might be harsh but again, lots of places to choose from."}
{"text":"First time sitting down here with my family and we were instantly greeted with a welcoming smile by the hostess. Our server (Kyle) was one of the most genuine, polite attentive we have had in Las Vegas in over 3 years. It made us feel very welcome and at home. The food was good and the pricing was great for two people. We will definitely recommend people to come here and enjoy a good meal. Nice atmosphere in Henderson and I'm happy its close to home."}
{"text":"We went today for the first time. One party member ordered hash and really enjoyed it.  Second party member ordered Phill Cheesesteak and home made chips. He enjoyed the sandwich but thought the chips tasted funny - ate them anyway. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich with french fries. The chicken salad sandwich was good (chicken could be cut into smaller pieces) . The french fries were NOT good. They tasted like the grease in the fryers needed to be changed badly. I left over 90% of them on my plate. The waitress was friendly and attentive. When she asked if I wanted a box to take the fries home - I told her no I did not like them. I asked how often they change the grease and was told twice a day. She said I was not the first customer to voice that concern today. Waitress said she would let Mgr know, which she did (We heard her tell Mgr). Mgr never came to table. I did hear Mgr tell cook there was a complaint about the fries tasting funny. I certainly was not looking for a free meal or huge discount, but offering to take $2 off the total ticket because of the fries would have been very decent of Mgr.  Unfortunately, either the Mgr couldn't be bothered or didn't care. We might or might not try the place out again, but I hope Mgmt is more responsive to customer complaints while said customer is in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was great - Helen is the bomb! The portions - yikes! Their entrees can easily be split. The BLT on 8grain bread - Yum!"}
{"text":"Good service, great prices  and love the self-serve beverage station.  Really appreciative of the  owner's interactions with his patrons-shows he cares.  The fried chicken is plentiful, as is tasty. You could have seconds or split it  with a friend. The honey and hot sauce combo put it over the top for our family. I normally enjoy squash, but their squash medley had something off with the oil/ seasoning.  Next time, I will substitute for something else. Chicken pot pie was creamy and well baked with the right ratio of crust and filling. We all were too stuffed for dessert and plan to return and try breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent experience at the soft opening this morning! The huevos rancheros were like nothing I've ever had before!! So delicious and full of flavor! They were BOMB!! The chicken and waffles were just as tasty! The fried chicken was super crispy and the waffles were scrumptious with that strawberry butter! I can't wait to go back to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Kenny and his team are fantastic! They make you feel right at home! Everything that we've had on our two visits here has been delicious! If you are feeling like some home cooked food- try the meatloaf platter!  The strawberry cheesecake stuffed waffles,that were a special today, were out of this world! There is something for everyone's tastes! Fantastic service! Fantastic food! Fantastic prices! You cannot beat that!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  We had six people at our table.  Javier was our waiter.  I think all six of us had some kind of special request for what we were ordering and he patiently took all of our orders, with a smile on his face!  He was SO accommodating.  Every order came perfect, the food was delicious and he came back plenty of times, to make sure we were happy with our food and to see if we needed anything else.  Would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Good morning! Great breakfast with a coffee, tea and soda station. It was a quick wait, considering it was a busy Saturday morning. It was so much food...I couldn't finish it. I had the home fries, pancakes, eggs, bacon and a biscuit. Please note: when you add extras like onions, jalape√±os and cheese it's .75 cents each. Overall the food was quick, hot, and delicious. If I could eat here every day and not gain a pound...this would be a fairy tale ending.  Time to go take a nap from all of the good food."}
{"text":"Being new in town and in the area, we stopped by. After waiting for over 30 minutes we left because we never got served. Wish I could rate the taste of the food, but that is impossible unless you get served. The person responsible for seating us was very cold and when we walked out he had the nerve to say \"have a good evening \".  I told him we never got served. The manager saw that we were still seated with menus in front of us and never inquired. Not even offered a drink order. YOU NEED TO GET IT TOGETHER!!!"}
{"text":"Let's talk about the corner beer hash. It's gotten a rave review here on Yelp, but unfortunately I have a different story to tell. If you love excessive amounts of rosemary then this is the dish for you--it was overall dry and bland, and the overcooked poached eggs didn't help. My husband ordered the eggs dish and the eggs were delicious and fluffy. They cooked the bacon perfectly as well--the only downside was the toast which was so overly buttered that it was dripping out of the toast. Overall, decent but probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"On October 2, the Monday following our horrible shooting at the 91 Country Music Festival, we went to breakfast at the Metro Diner.  Our Grandson, Chase (an active Marine based in Camp Pendleton) and his girlfriend Denae had been at the Festival the night previous.  We had picked them up during the melee along with others on Tropicana Ave.  It had been a horrible night for all of us and we had stopped for a quick breakfast before going to the Lexus Hotel to recover belongings and for them to return home. We had previously dined here and loved it.  However, after dining on a super wonderful meal we asked our Server Patience for the check.  The onsite manager, Hanna, informed us their was not charge and they would take care of the check.  They thanked myself (a veteran) and my Grandson for our service and explained how sad they were for the events they had observed at the Festival.  What a wonderful gesture and pleasant surprise from a very concerned group of employees and employers.  I have in the past experienced wonderful service and food.  These people are incredibly gracious, attentive and professional.  It felt like family.  Just wish to thank them for their kindness and tell them they have a customer for life.  We plan to visit them often. They are exactly what a people business should be and they demonstrate great pride in our city and community.  We would recommend them to anyone interested in great food and service in Henderson.  Thank you all for being so wonderful, concerned and thankful. You are the best. Larry and Patti McGrorty, Henderson, NV"}
{"text":"My review is for dinner/lunch because we came here in the late afternoon. The place was still busy but the wait for a table for 6 was no more than 10 minutes. The service was great but the dinner food was ok. Nothing really hearty or filling for diner/comfort food. We ordered the meatloaf dinner, club sandwich, chicken fried steak dinner, half order of the chicken & waffles and kids grilled cheese. The meatloaf was delicious but only two small slices. For the price, were expecting a huge platter of meat. The club was mediocre with way too much sharp cheddar cheese that was over powering all the other flavors, I ended up picking it off. The chicken fried steak was good but again, not a lot for the price. The half order of chicken and waffles was perfect for our 11 year old. The syrup is a hot sauce blend to give it a little kick. The kids grilled was a regular size sandwich but had entirely way too much cheese for a kids meal. I had to cut off so much cheese so my 3 year old would eat it. You think of diner food you want comfort hearty food and I didn't feel Metro was that, at least not for lunch/dinner Foods. I have heard good things about their breakfast which is more reasonably priced so I would be back to try it out. But would not return for lunch/dinner. That staff was amazing, so nice and attentive which is why they get three stars."}
{"text":"Meh. They do diner food well enough, but there are a ton of breakfast spots around here that do it just as well or better. Don't order anything even remotely fancy here and expect it to shine -- the eggs benny were rubbery and flavorless. Service was friendly, parking was easy, and there was no wait."}
{"text":"The BEST food and EXCELLENT customer service.  Food came out super fast.  Staff are super friendly and courteous.  And the FOOD IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!  Reasonably priced for the huge portions.  I will definitely come back again and again!"}
{"text":"The food is good, and nice sized portions. Staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Brand New Diner with delicious food and oversized portions.  Had the chance to dine in on Sunday and i have to say...The Ruben is outta this world. Most excellent and personable service from Liz and staff. Keep up the good work! Highly Recommend Diner!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the breakfast BUT had 1 complaint. Eggs very well scrambled, bacon perfect, rye toast good and service was fine. However, the hashbrowns I recieived were overdone and tasted more like the potato sticks out of a can. Whether they sat around too long would just be conjecture on my part, but need to be improved!"}
{"text":"Overall Under-whelming  On the positive side, the place has a welcoming exterior with a small area for patio dining.   It is easy to find in Matthews Festival, close to the Home Depot and Texas Roadhouse.   The interior decor is pretty standard, nothing stood out one way or the other.  They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner all day! Any place that serves breakfast all day always gets one star just for that as I am a night person.   When we were seated I noticed the table was not clean and there was some food caked on.  I asked for the table to be wiped down again.  However, it was still sticky whenever I put my arms or hands on the table.   We were looking forward to the chicken and waffles with the strawberry butter.  My son ordered this to try and I ordered one of the egg breakfasts and upgraded my side to corn beef hash.  I also ordered the Cheesiest Grits.   The waitress was a bit of a character.  She did not seem super knowledgeable about the menu.    Plates and utensils were placed down.  The utensils were in a wax paper like wrapping - only a fork and knife (no spoon).  When my tea arrived, there was food caked on the plate with the teapot (see photo).  Also one of my two napkins had food on it (see photo).  I was very apprehensive to eat with concerns about cleanliness.    Now for the food.  The homemade corn beef hash is potatoes and meat (no onions, peppers etc.)  I like it like that but it was pretty tasteless.  The Cheesiest Grits were disappointing - plain, unflavored grits with a thin layer of melted cheese on top (see both photos). I was expecting cheese flavored grits with cheese inside as well.  I was never brought over a spoon with the grits and had to ask for one.  No butter was brought over with the toast.  The waffles were nice and fluffy, the strawberry butter is very subtle, in a good way as to not overpower the dish.  The waffles come with \"signature sweet and spicy sauce\".  Our jaws dropped when the waitress came over with a bowl, asked us to hand her the hot sauce on the table, and squeezed some hot sauce in the bowl and mixed in regular pancake syrup! (See photo) I think it would be better for them to do this in the back and leave the \"signature\" recipe to our imaginations.  The chicken was very bony, very salty.  I was expecting more of a honey flavoring for some reason that would go better with breakfast.  The crunchy coating was unremarkable.  The waitress at one point came to our table and motioned with her hands.  We had no idea what she was indicating but then she told us to hand her our plates.  She did not ask if we were done.  We were, but she should have confirmed.  We were asked several times if needed anything so she was attentive, just a bit unconventional.  The chicken & waffles were almost $16, definitely not worth the price tag.  I used the Ladies Room on my way out as I had to wash my hands from the sticky table.  The restroom could have used some cleaning, would grade it a B- as I have seen much worse.  To top it off, it was Mother's Day.  We came at a non-busy hour and two girls were at the host station with no other customers to attend.  They were giving out flowers to mothers and I wanted to see if they offered me one.  It was pretty obvious I was a mom, and although they DID thank us for coming and bid us a nice day, a flower was not offered.  I know I could have asked or taken one, but I wanted to see if they did so.   I am glad to see others had a more positive experience, but I felt the establishment was not clean, the food and service were neutral.  I went with higher expectations but unfortunately will not be dining here again."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken and waffles to go.  Everyone I dealt with were friendly and helpful.   Chicken and waffles were good.  The spicy sauce (like a syrup with Tabasco) was tasty on the chicken."}
{"text":"The food is edible, but nothing to rave about. The prices are a bit high for what you get.  Other places have better food at half the price."}
{"text":"Breakfast was awesome, from the croissant French toast to the works hashbrowns to the Charleston shrimp and grits, the food was amazing"}
{"text":"Had breakfast there this morning. It was wonderful. The food was slow coming out, but considering it is Mother's Day I expected it. The food was very good and the manager stopped by to explain why the food was taking time. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The waitress was great, but the food was subpar.  Very greasy and felt like reheated leftovers.  Not freshly made, just reheated.  I was excited to go, hoping it would be good, but was disappointed.  They were busy and the service was good - just can't say the same for the food."}
{"text":"There food is always no matter what state you travel to if they have a metro diner. You can count on it being good food. I travel for a living they have never let me down. From the chicken and waffles to the meatloaf. Always great"}
{"text":"After a rigorous morning workout, We decided to try this place out for a \"cheat\" meal after seeing so many amazing reviews on Yelp.  Pulling up Metro Diner had odd branding to me. The sign and large awning outside was in art deco style which you don't see too often in Vegas, but I believe was a nod back to the Floridian origin of this chain.   Walking in through the first set of front doors the hostess was holding open the second set of double doors welcoming us with a smile. She sat us immediately, introduced our waitress by name, and talked about some of their specials for the day.  It was such a nice greeting first thing in the morning.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and made it vegetarian by subbing avocado for the chorizo, my husband ordered the Corned Beef Hash and we both split a short stack of pancakes.  At first glance the menus seemed pretty pedestrian but what came out was not so at all.  The Huevos Rancheros was served with a choice of eggs (scrambled) over fried tortilla shells, with black beans, onions and peppers and topped with melted cheese, salsa, sour cream, and fried jalape√±os.  The fried jalape√±os were such an interesting touch; still crispy from the fryer they were spicy tangy and delicious.  The presentation was very eye catching.  The Corned Beef Hash is made in house and served with diced red-skinned potatoes, two poached eggs and toast. My husband said the corned beef was very good but only wished the potatoes were more crispy. Otherwise he liked it a lot.  The portions are huge, honestly with the three dishes we ordered we could have fed 4-5 hungry people.  Thanks for the great recommendation Yelpers!  You guys delivered."}
{"text":"My favorite diner, Lacey the manager is so nice and friendly and Sherry our server too this place is nice and clean. My husband ordered Chicken and waffle they are so delightful it's crispy, juicy, tasty Southern comfort food, I hope they continue this kind of service. I ordered Huevos Rancheros and it's also delicious. Portions are generous. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to South Charlotte!! I had the chicken salad salad, and it was outstanding. The portion was more than enough! Our waitress was kind and helpful and the service top notch. My son had the Huevos Rancheros and he scarfed it down! The portions are huge and the service fast and friendly. You should try it!"}
{"text":"I love this diner! Friendly quick staff, the food is delicious every time I order something new too. The only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars is because of the price. $10 for 2 pancakes is a great deal : for the Metro but not for my wallet. Awesome pancakes! Terrible price."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far.  Good solid comfort food, fast friendly service, and in a comfortable, non-gaming, non-smoking, neighborhood-diner style ambience (as the name promises).  Prices aren't the lowest in town for the simple reason that their food sales aren't subsidized by video poker machines like most other places in town serving diner-style and bar food - but they are more than reasonable, and well worth it to get away from the usual poker-bar atmosphere that pervades the area.  Oh, their coffee is fantastic for a place that isn't Sbux or Dunkin."}
{"text":"Our family was introduced to the original in Jacksonville Beach several years back.  Imagine our surprise and delight when we heard one opened here! Any fears of not being as good as the original fly out the door when the sounds and smells of the Metro fill your senses.  Service was friendly and lively, they hired and trained well here.  The food, ah!  The food!  From perfectly poached eggs with bright hollandaise sauce set atop a Belgian waffle and fried chicken to the Monte Cristo sandwich to the cinnamon swirl pancakes, your biggest struggle will be what to order your first time in.  The next time you come, your problem will be do you order what you had last time because it was the best whatever you ever had or do you branch out and try something new.  The secret?  Go with others so you can try it all!  Yes, I'm a big fan of Metro and the new place did not disappoint.  Can't wait to try the other two here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I really liked this place a lot! I've only been once so far, I had the cornbeef hash. It was excellent. My friend had the chicken and waffles, I tasted it, and next time I'm there, that's what I'll get! It was scrumptious!!! Keep up the good work!! Our waitress was great too!!"}
{"text":"Metro Diner has rapidly expanded in Vegas, opening 3 locations in just one year! For some reason, this location isn't up to par with the service I have received at the others. If this location were my introduction to the chain, I probably wouldn't return.  First visit, I came in solo. After taking my order, I never saw my server again. There was an error with my order, and the hassle of having to hunt down the staff made me suck it up and eat it anyway. The seasonal pumpkin spice coffee was awesome. But seriously? Service was the total opposite of Tropicana and Rainbow locations.  Second (and last) visit, I interacted with the manager who was just totally unprofessional. I was there about a promo they were running on social media, and apparently this location wasn't participating. He was rude and dismissive. Maybe it was an off day for him. My server was super sweet and attentive, but I won't be back: as a two star Yelp rating indicates, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"Been going to Metro Diner since their first location on Tropicana opened last May.  The Trop location suddenly closed a few weeks ago and a sign on the door read \"Closed for relocation\" and some notes about opening up later in the year in a new location to better serve the Las Vegas community.  Businesses open and close all the time so whatever just a little amazed the location didn't make it to its 1st anniversary.  Well I had a hankering for Metro so drove to the Rainbow location.  Service great as always, but the food was not up to the standard I was used to at the Trop location.  Corned beef hash was dry, like so dry the corned beef was crumbly and really fine in texture, and the poached eggs were over poached.  Nothing worse than dry CBH with over cooked eggs to boot.  Probably just a one off experience and I'll ultimately give this location another shot, but unfortunately since this location is twice as far from my place as the Tropicana location I won't be a regular here."}
{"text":"I have been back to Metro diner several times since my first visit and I am never disappointed.  I had to give an additional shout out because last time I was there I got the Bissell (a lot of food for $11) with a waffle instead of pancakes.  The waffle comes with powered sugar which I am not a fan of but isn't a big deal.  When one of the servers saw me tapping the waffle on my plate to get some of sugar off and asked if I would like a new one.  I declined but the kitchen staff went ahead and prepared a new waffle for me with no sugar with out me asking.  Now that is service!"}
{"text":"First visit based in reviews- really nice family atmosphere and buzzing with activity. Knowledgeable staff and attentive to beverage needs. Ordered the chicken and waffles as many of the reviews recommended with a sausage and gravy. The portions are big enough to share. Unless you're bringing a HUGE appetite seriously share or count on leftovers. Served fast and HOT the food was delicious. Owner visited the table to ensure everything was to our liking. Personal attention and customer service gets 5 Stars!!!!"}
{"text":"My first visit here was about 2 months ago. I'm not entirely sure when this place opened but I knew it was fairly new. Either way, I ordered the San Francisco Benedict. The atmosphere and everything seemed great. When my food arrived and I took a bite, I realized I had been given the wrong dish as this one was called the Sandi Benedict and had spinach in it. It wasn't a huge deal to me. I really just wanted avocado, so I let the waitress know I had been given the wrong plate. She said she'd fix it and went to the back. I decided to stop eating as I wasn't sure if they were just bringing avocado or if they were bringing a whole plate out. After about 5 minutes of my boyfriend eating and me waiting, a manager came over and asked if everything was okay. I replied that yes as the waitress said she was handling it. Another 5-10 go by and I hadn't heard anything. I was hungry and now my food was cold so I just started eating it. Finally, the waitress comes out and asks if the manager handled my issue. I told her that I told the manager she was handling it. She ran off to figure it out I guess. I ate my cold food and was very unhappy. The manager came over later and apologized and told me that the waitress hit the wrong item on the tablet and they are so busy with trainees that it was chaotic. She gave me a $13 voucher and did not charge me for my meal. She assured me that it isn't normally like that, so I accepted this and planned to return in the future. I would like to mention that the food was good, but the experience wasn't.  I returned just this last Saturday intending to use the voucher and give them go #2. We had a young male server this time. He was nice and polite. I asked him how their herbal tea is (as that is all it was listed as on menu) and he said he hadn't tried it but knows it's some sort of seasonal harvest blend. I agreed to try it. When he brought it and ran off, I noticed he brought me coffee. I waited for him to come back around. I'm really trying at this point to give this place a chance but it was striking out again already. When he finally returned I clarified that I asked for tea, to which he said he thought I asked for coffee and he said he'd bring the tea. When the tea came, the water in the pot was basically almost room temperature. It was just lukewarm. I was sort of done trying so I just lived with it. I ordered the same thing I intended to have the last time. When the food finally came, my hash browns were nice and hot, but the eggs were again room temperature. Not even the slightest bit warm. I didn't complain. I just ate my cold food and made the decision I won't be returning any time soon. Again, the food is good (Should be at least warm) but my experiences here have not been the best. Maybe I'll give this place a year or so to get things together before returning. I've never been anywhere where I have had back to back not so great experiences. I gave it 2 stars for the food being okay alone."}
{"text":"Wanted steak and eggs looked online and found this place. Some other person had put a stupid review about their water??  but I'm here now and I am loving it I can tell you the food is good the atmosphere is good and me and my son are having a great breakfast together!! I gotta say my steak is so flavorful!!"}
{"text":"If you are coming here for the coffee/beverage station and monte cristo sandwich...IT'S NOT AT THIS LOCATION!  I walked through the door READY for that coffee station so I cup sip a cup during our 30-45 minute wait. But I look around and what did I see? One little coffee dispenser and my heart sank. Oh well...  I had the chicken and waffles last time and vowed to come back for the monte cristo. I sat and watched the window as the food passed through and I saw a ton of chicken and waffles, but not one monte cristo. Upon being seated I went about scanning the menu for the sandwich, ...MIA! We asked our waiter about it just in case we were simply overlooking it, 'we don't have it' was his response.   Anyway, it took a minute for our coffee to arrive barely warm and I went with the chicken and waffles again. Surprisingly, it was better this time. I am going to give them a few months to get up to speed before I go back and I'll call first to see if the monte cristo is on the menu.  Overall, it was a good experience and I'm not unreasonable, I know this location is new so..."}
{"text":"I love it when we find a place that we start planning what we'll order on our next visit. THIS PLACE IS IT!  First, the coffee/tea/soft drink area. There is an actual area within the restaurant where you can help yourself...even while you wait! I loved that!  Everything on the menu looked amazing as plates whizzed by us. Our waitress was extremely nice. We ordered the chicken and waffles...LOVED IT! That day they had a special of cheesecake stuffed waffles...INCREDIBLE! And the croissant french toast...YUMMY! The servings were plentiful.  On our next visit, he are trying the Monte Cristo! That is the plan. I can't wait to get back here."}
{"text":"Comfort food at its best! I've been to Metro Diner about a dozen times since it opened and it's become a regular in our dinner rotation.  The fried chicken is awesome and the best part is, I always have enough leftover for tomorrow (double bonus). But my favorite item has to be the meatloaf. I usually hate meatloaf - either it's dry, has too many spices, or tastes too \"meaty.\" But this meatloaf is moist, seasoned well and filling! I initially only tried it because my husband ordered it and raved about it. Now it's one of my go-tos.  I've also had breakfast and lunch there - both of which were good, not great. So for me, dinner is where it's at. My only complaint is, there are no refills on their flavored iced tea :(  Service is always excellent, friendly staff and very accommodating!"}
{"text":"Excellent little diner! My friends had the chicken and waffles and eggs benedict and loved em. And I had the chicken tenders plate. Soooo good! Very tender and moist. Our waiter was awesome. So friendly and super helpful. One of our friends' meal came out late so they gave her a complimentary soup while she waited for her meal since the rest of us had ours already. You can tell they take pride in their restaurant. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We were looking for another breakfast spot to tryout and I believe that we have found one. Location, Service, and Food was very good. I know they only been here for 10 days at this location and sometimes places do exceptional task to make you feel welcome. I just hope they continue this behavior going forward because it was welcoming."}
{"text":"The staff members are so nice and courteous! Their meatloaf is, hands down, the best meatloaf I've had in my life! The huevos rancheros is also super yummy too!"}
{"text":"Of all my reviews do I rarely give out 5 stars but this place deserves it. The customer service is off the charts in this place from the time u walk in the door till you leave. I sat at the bar and got a birds eye view of the kitchen and the cooks got it going on. I believe my servers name was Amber she was great. This place is the bomb and I will be back. I ordered the giant fish sandwich, I got mines grilled but u can get it fried or blackened which I will try next time. Phenomenal, hands down the best Diner I've been to in the city and there were a lot of people in and out of this place for the location of it. I was very surprised I don't even know how long it's been there."}
{"text":"Adorable little diner. The food was absolutely delicious. I will definitely go again and again."}
{"text":"Food was great and staff was very friendly! The Charleston shrimp and grits was not traditional but very good."}
{"text":"Typical diner environment. Always a wait on the weekends. Huge portions. You will not leave this place hungry."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Metro Diner, when I lived in Raleigh. I enjoyed going there, as the atmosphere was great & the food was always delicious! I LOVE breakfast, any time of the day!  One of my best friends was in town over the Christmas holiday & we decided to eat here. It was a weekday & they were pretty busy.  I got the two eggs (scrambled) breakfast with bacon & sourdough bread. I also got a side order of grits.  Between the order & food arrival time was great! Presentation was A+ & the food tasted great. Our waitress was very attentive.  Prices are very reasonable & I love the variety of items on the menu. Something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it never disappoints. Everything is amazing. It does tend to get a little busy on the weekends but worth the wait. The staff and amazing comfort food make for an amazing combo. It's a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Such a fun and great place!!. Food and service were both as good as could b!!. Such a real home diner feel the whole time!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in north Charlotte, hands down! Whether you're in a rush and need to sit at the bar or get the chance to relax at a table, the food is delicious and the service is friendly and efficient. Couldn't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"Simple, comfort food done well. We were hankering for some English fish-n-chips, and finding there weren't any close by, tried here. What we found, was that these are more a Southern style, but delicious none-the-less. And when you try the fried chicken & waffles, you can understand this place is doing a lot right.  Somewhat casual dining, but with a pretty decent vibe. The people working were all very upbeat and approacheable. Service was attentive and non-intrusive. We visited on a weekday early, so parking wasn't a problem. And even though they had televisions overhead, they weren't terribly distracting. I would definitely call this family friendly. And that fried chicken and waffles will make a great kids' order.  The menu is full of comfort food. And sometimes, this is just what the doctor ordered. They do a few things very well. That fired chicken & waffles had a very nice, light and crispy skin (same for the fish-n-chips). The portions are definitely for fat Americans- generous to the point of take-home left-overs. I can see this place looming large when the craving for comfort food takes grip.  Just so you don't think this was a paid advertising, I do have to let you know of a big Fail on their menu. Served with the fried chicken & waffles, they'll mix up a small cup of Loisiana hot sauce and maple syrup. This is actually a horrendous idea. One pinky's each was enough to place it on the opposite side of the table for us. But, since this in an 'extra', and not even on the menu, I'll forgive them for that.   I can't see how elderly people and families (or anyone, really) can miss here. Did I mention they make a mean fried chicken & waffles?"}
{"text":"We had high expectations after reading all the positive reviews and decided to give breakfast a try. Sadly our expectations were not met. The biggest issue is training! The staff seem to have a willingness to provide service but lack structure and training. I walked in with my kids at 10.30 am and the hostess told us sit anywhere. A free for all, no menus, no guidance just pick a table! The problem was none of the tables were clean inside or outside on the patio. We sat at a dirty table and waited for about ten minutes until Chastity came and cleaned our table. She then got us menus and  proceeded to serve us, however you could see that she along with the rest of the staff were overwhelmed. She brought coffee but no creamer and then we had to wait for silverware. By that time my coffee was cold. The breakfast food is mediocre, nothing to write home about. I ordered eggs with sausage links and waffles for my kids. The eggs were rubbery and tough and the sausage links were deep fried. Is that a southern thing? The waffles were fine. The manager should have been on the  floor clearing tables today and meeting and greeting guests. Not a good start for a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Hubby and I tried it on a cold wet Sunday morning. This place was jumping the wait was suppose to be 45 mins I think we waited for 15 max. (Yay) we were seated and had an amazing waitress who explained the specials and even helped me decide. The food came out amazing and the cheese grits I will have again. Worth a visit"}
{"text":"The food has always been great and no complaints with service. Everyone was always friendly. We were here a couple nights ago and just drove by and we're sad to see it has closed..."}
{"text":"Good food, good music and good service! We have been to Metro Diner a handful of times so far and the service is always friendly. From the Huevos Rancheros (which I put up at the top of my list of HR I've ever had) to the fried chicken, everything has been great!   Menu selection is broad enough to cover everything from breakfast to dinner (I can't wait to try the meatloaf) so if your group is coming at mid-day there are plenty of options for everyone.   Definitely in our regular rotation!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on Saturday.  Food was very good and service was excellent.  Will be back"}
{"text":"This place was a good find! Non smoking, not loud and good food. Large portions and excellent service. Full menu is served all day, breakfast and diner."}
{"text":"Ehh.  Diner food. Servers last Sunday night were not attentive at all. Probably not return."}
{"text":"This place is a welcome addition to an area that needs more non-fast food restaurants. The service was prompt and food came out fast. The four of us all had a hard time deciding what to order. There are a lot of unique comfort food options on the menu. There is a Pittsburgh feel to the menu (fries on salad and Primanti's knock-off sandwich) and the visual is Art Deco."}
{"text":"Wow!! Metro Diner has the best chicken and waffles!! When we travel, we do as the locals do. We try the different local establishments. They Definitely have shareable sizes unless you're feeling daring to tackle the plate...We would highly recommend it. The flavors were good and the waffles crisp with a side of their spicy maple syrup.   Military friendly: yes, 10% discount"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it wasn't bad. It just opened so there are people still being trained. Our waiter Anthony was obviously still very new and seemed a little out of it but he was ok. The food was pretty good. My girlfriend got the pot roast which was amazing. It was tender and juicy. The mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious. I got the Cajun chicken pasta which was one of their specials but it wasn't that great. It came out and the sauce looked thick and gritty which was exactly the texture I got. The flavor was ok but it was quite salty. I would certainly go back again but obviously I'm not getting the same thing."}
{"text":"Great diner! Love coming here with some friends! Reasonably priced too. Will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is now my go to brunch spot. Yes,it's a chain, but trust me this restaurant will not disappoint. The shrimp and grits are awesome and the huevos ranchero is unlike anything I've ever had in the best way! I haven't had anything here I did not like."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday about 11ish was a little crowded but we got seated right away, ordered the infamous YoHala french toast and lets just say its was nothing id ever had before.  It was not appealing to look at once you cut into it and with all that's inside of it it makes it taste as if its not cooked all the way,  i did not finish it and nope didn't take it home either.  Guess we should of known something was not quite right when the two tables around us both had issues with their food as well...one had to return a steak and the other returned two different plates....id like to try this place again since its just around the corner from my house and work and maybe on a less so busy day it could be better??"}
{"text":"Their parking lot is small and fills up quick but it's soo worth the wait! On a busy Friday, we came in for brunch and were a little overwhelmed by the large menu full of delicious options! Yolanda, our server, helped us and gave us great service. She did not rush us at all and was always around to ask if we needed anything despite the fact that the place was full. She was a phenomenal server and I will make it a point to be back just because she made such a great impression!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was really good. Great place, atmosphere, awesome service, and most importantly, good food!"}
{"text":"While I can certainly see why parking lot is unbelievably crammed and line out the door an any given lunchtime, there is room for improvement. Three visits with same vibe which includes friendly staff with great introduction, but ends in flagging someone down when you need something because of the intense turnover. The home fries have no seasoning, but burgers will knock your socks off. Basically, killing it in some areas but failing epically where it matters. The 4-star is because you can tell they are really shaking things up in the area, but attention to detail is key."}
{"text":"We went here based on some input from or friends.  I was in the mood for some meatloaf and.....was totally disappointed.  Although the sandwich my wife had was good, we both agreed that there was nothing special here that would make us go back again.  So we checked the box to say we did and called it a day.   Service wasnt the greatest either, but it didn't matter after the disappointment of the food."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever been to a place where the majority of the group was unhappy with the food.  There was 7 in our group. We witnessed a drink, delivered to another table, being spilt on the customer.  Within a few minutes at another table and a different employee, another drink was almost spilt.  Let's say I was on edge, I didn't want to leave soaked. Silverware, but no napkins, had to ask for them after food arrived. Chicken Pot Pie - over baked, with little to no creamy filling.  Inconsistent cooking as another table's looked wonderful Reuben - ok, not the best, not the worst, mac & cheese side was cold and did't have a good taste, replaced with fries Burger - ok Chicken & Waffles - no complaint Monti Cristo - awful, meat didn't taste good, oil used to fry was old (over used), in the fryer too long, 2 other people tried it, one agreed the meat wasn't good & the oil was old, the other spit it out Burger - asked how wanted cooked, ordered well done, received medium maybe medium-well, fries were cold, fries were replaced Chicken & Waffles - sauce wasn't included  At the onset, I thought this will be good, maybe I'll bring my husband here, at the end, there is no way I'll step foot back in here.  The one good thing was the take home bags (both Chicken & Waffles, since it was half a chicken, and the Reuben since her husband will eat anything)."}
{"text":"The four of us went to the Metro yesterday for brunch.   Very pleasantly surprised.  Great menu.  Quickly served by our super waitress Adrianne Gonzales.  Knowledgable,  good recommendations and quick refills. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Service is bad here food is good my waiter sucked I wish I would have got his name. But none of them have name tags and it seemed like he didn't care to tell us Idk because of this experience if I will be coming back. Every thing is about the hype these days and insta and guy hyped this place up so whatever. Idk about you but I like good service and if it's not good it usually fucks it up for me unfortunately I wish it could have been better because the food looked really good but damn smh!!! Get your shit together Vegas learn how to treat people and maybe you would get more tips but you gotta work for your money ain't nothing handed to you so next time you wait on someone think about it and the end of the day it's your mouth you gotta feed and bills you gotta pay."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's like home cooking done to perfection. The strawberry butter on the waffles is to die for and the staff is ultra nice and friendly. Will be going back to try more things."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with a friend. My 1st impression of the place was that the place is clean and fairly busy. We were seated in a booth right away. Ordered French dip w/mashed potatoes. To be honest, this has to be the worst sandwich I've ever had that I didn't even finish it. First of all, the food was cold. The bread was dry. The meat had too much fat and the dip was absolutely tasteless. The French dip you can get at Arby's is much better than what I got here, and much cheaper as well. The gravy on my mash potatoes was very salty. If it wasn't for their service, I would just give 2 stars....don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Breakfast is always awesome and they are very kid friendly :) staff is super sweet and food is AMAZING."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing!! Liz was our server and she was very attentive and well knowledgable! My husband and I ordered omelettes( American and western omelettes) and were very pleased! The hash browns were amazing and so were my grits! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Very good.  Got the Chicken Salad Melt--open face style.  Will come back & try other menu items.   Service was nice.  Crew looks like they have fun--nice to see while you're eating"}
{"text":"I guess this place was on DDD on Food network in Florida.  Beautiful place, beautiful people and delicious food.  The staff here is fantastic.  They ask and listen to what you want.  They serve you and check up on you.  The food is out of this world!  I never found a chicken and waffles dish that I have actually enjoyed since Roscoe's in Compton, so that's what I'm gaging this review on.  The chicken is so freshly made.  Juicy on the inside and crunchy and savory on the outside.  The waffles are buttery and so delicious.  They even serve it up with a sweet and spicy sauce, I'm not a fan of that flavor so I passed.  I tried my daughter's eggs Benedict and it was also different in a good way.  The hollandaise sauce seemed homemade, with no separation and enough to stay creamy and tasteful.  They also have hazelnut coffee, it's so good!!! This will be our go to brekkie from now on!!"}
{"text":"Excellent biscuits and gravy.  Big portions.  Fast service and friendly people.  Will come again."}
{"text":"Great food at an even greater price. The customer service is excellent. Every time I've been they have added a dish to their menu and they never disappoint. This is a great neighborhood spot to try out and great for families, they serve both breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Charlotte.  Have frequented both the Matthews and Pineville locations many times and always enjoyed my meals.   The value is great as are the daily specials.  If you haven't been you need to check it out."}
{"text":"Metro Diner is a MUST TRY!! In a 48 Hour period I had the Fried Chicken & Waffles (5/5 ), Avacado Wrap (4.5/5), Fried Chicken sandwich (4/5), and White Meat Chicken Salad sandwich (3/5). The sides were really good. French fries were good, the saut√©ed vegetables were perfect, and the Mac n Cheese was really good for not being seasoned really!"}
{"text":"Mom had the chicken pot pie and I had the Reuben. Had a taste of her chicken pot pie and it was pretty good! The crust was a huge biscuit and was perfectly cooked and delicious! Don't quite understand why they put lima beans in it, not a huge fan of lima beans, but overall it was really good! The Reuben, all I can say is OMG so delicious! Perfect size portions and the onion rings were crisp and delicious, then on to desert, peach cobbler with some vanilla ice cream on top! My most favorite desert in the entire world lives here now! And to top it off, John, our waiter was so nice and willing to jump through hoops for all of his customers including us. Local diner feel was amazing, can't say enough good things about the Metro Diner. Thank you so much!!!"}
{"text":"Chicken and Waffles are my fave! Very friendly servers...waiting for a slow day to head back."}
{"text":"One of the best diners around. John A. is an amazing server.  The food from breakfast to dinner is delicious.  Highly recommend checking out Metro Diner."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and ready to steer you in the right direction if you are confused on what to get. It has a cozy feel on the inside and food got out to us pretty quickly. Over all, the food is good and well priced."}
{"text":"Great food.  Interesting options to choose from.  They have flavored teas that don't have to be sweet.  Service has always been prompt and the wait times have always been quick.  One of the spots in our regular rotation."}
{"text":"Nice and refreshing diner.  Lotsa options.  Breakfast available all dat. Still working out some bugs. Crew has team approach.  Wait staff still training.   Kitchen servers deliver.  Bus staff swing by frequently to remove trash and used dishes. We started with tomato bisque.  Had a hiccup in that soup not hot.  Kenny corrected and brought out fresh.  Was on warm spicy side.  Large bits of tomatoes and veggies. Entrees Charleston Shrimp n Grits.  Very good.  Had grit cakes.  Creamy sauce.  Thick.  Shrimp very good. Filling. Fried Chicken dinner. Very fresh and hot.  Side salad.   Kept drinks flowing. Good experience."}
{"text":"Food (I've only had savory so far) and service were both very good.  After seemingly trying a new breakfast place every few weeks I think we've settled on this one.  Can't wait till they open at Rainbow and Warm Springs."}
{"text":"On vacation in South Park and my wife found this place. We went for breakfast, she had biscuits and gravy with 2 eggs and hash browns I had the regular eggs Benedict. Both our meals were excellent. The eggs were cooked perfectly, mine poached and my wife's over medium, theses eggs tasted fresh as can be. Portion size was just perfect although there was no way my wife could eat all of hers. I was not about to leave any on. My plate. The service was really good as well. I would return there no problem..."}
{"text":"We got the Holy Davoli which is a burger with grilled cheeses as the buns.  It was heaven.  Melissa was our server was the best, cheerful, helpful and fun.  I will definitely come back any time I am in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Seriously, why do people think this place is good?!?!  We've gone twice and both times it was crap.   The first time I had the meatloaf. I've never had meatloaf with that consistency. It was like baked dog food, only not as good.   Today we came for breakfast. I ordered the breakfast pie (their specialty), Mike had biscuits and gravy.   We waited 35 minutes (literally). When our food arrived it was obvious that Mike's food had been sitting. His eggs and hash browns were cold and there was a gross film over his biscuits and gravy.   I ordered bacon with mine, but I didn't get it. You'd think after waiting for so long they could've at least served me some improperly cooked bacon.   The manager came over with her bullshit apology. It was inauthentic and patronizing.   I've seen the reviews on Yelp, the owner's mother must have written them, because anyone who's ever been to a restaurant in Vegas could tell that this place sucks."}
{"text":"Best Chicken and Waffles I've ever had!  Order tenders instead of regular fried chicken.  Soooooo good!"}
{"text":"Great fast service if you're ready to kill the breakfast cravings any time of day , I love this place"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my first visit to Metro diner. The food was delicious and the customer service was even better. I went with my young son, teenaged niece and nephew on a packed Friday evening.  It was about a 15 to 20 minutes wait for a table so we decided to stay in matthews vs riding to the Charlotte location which expressed no wait when I called. I got the chicken dinner which was absolutely delicious. More than possibly expected to eat in one meal. My nephew opted for a bacon croissant with home fried potatoes. With my little one getting chicken tenders with fries. The only person to experience an issue with their meal was my niece. Her burger was incorrect and upon realization the server (Jennifer) apologized and tried correcting the problem. Moments later a man appearing to be in management came over to apologize and explained how they do not work that way.  He promptly removed the burger from the bill to our amazement. We didn't ask nor expect for that to happen. Aside from the good being delicious the service will take them far. Treat yourself while in the area.  I look forward to experimenting with the menu on future visits."}
{"text":"regular good ole diner . it was good, it wasn't amazing.  they did have croissant french toast which i did order & enjoyed.  the chicken biscuit was good too. i like the sweet spicy combo"}
{"text":"This is the kind of resturant that when you take that first bite you get that life is good feeling. They serve breakfast all day so I tried the biscuits and gravy. I have had a hard time finding good biscuits and gravy in Las Vegas but no more it was excellent. I would rate it as a must try. I will be going back to try their burgers since they looked so good. Great service and a really cool oldies vibe. A must try if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Had the crab cakes benedict with home fries and coffee. Will definitely make a return visit."}
{"text":"I went to have brunch with my bf and this place can get packed but the wait is worth the wait. I got their signature dish the chicken and waffles. I was good and the service here is good. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We have a wonderful dinner our server was Jackie.  Great service and great food.We are coming back for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"After visiting Metro Diner in Raleigh, NC, I was anxious to visit this location. It was around 815am on a Saturday morning. The parking lot and restaurant weren't crowded and we were seated immediately which was great because we were in somewhat of a rush. I ordered the two egg breakfast and an additional side of grits. The food was great. However, my hash browns were pretty crispy. I'd rather they be a little crispy opposed to tasting uncooked but they were a bit too crispy for my liking. We had to sit and wait a few minutes in order to order drinks. Once those came, we continued to wait for a server. Other than those things, the food was good, experience was good. The bacon was better at the Raleigh location but that's ok :)."}
{"text":"Consistently tasty comfort food. Not a foodie place but it is great for families. Try it for brunch or a quick early bird dinner. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Was ok. Orderef a turkey sandwich and bread was so dry it fell apart and couldn't enjoy it as a sandwich.  Friend of mine with me ordered a hamburger medium and half was medium and half was well done. Water taste like it came out of the toilet. Servers were nice but that's about it. I've been to the one one Rainbow and much different experience. Much better at the rainbow location."}
{"text":"THE BEST BREAKFAST around!!  Each time I've gone I've never been disappointed.  The portion size is crazy and the flavor is on point.  Recommend  this spot if you like good service and good food."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on Veteran's Day. Didn't know it was here, but my gf is always searching Yelp for new places and found it. So, we ventured out. I love the atmosphere. Everyone is really friendly, and I felt comfortable.  Extensive menu, and you can order whatever you want all day long!!!! We got breakfast, which was well worth every dime and you get your money's worth. This will be added to my list of go-to spots. Will try their dinner options next time."}
{"text":"We live in Denver, NC, but unfortunately, have never found a decent breakfast here, so we decided to drive a bit further to try Metro Diner. So worth the 15 minute drive. They have a great menu with so much to choose from. The food was delicious and the wait staff was friendly and accommodating. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Wow!! We waited too long to come here! Some friends of ours wanted to go for brunch and we decided on Metro Diner. This place is legit! There was about a 20 minute wait but it was worth it.   Jaci was our server and she was perfect. Ask for her.   I had the Bissel Breakfast, which is 2 eggs, hash browns, bacon or sausage, an English muffin or toast and a couple pancakes. Great value for the money!! I loved everything about it. The hash browns were crispy and perfect, the eggs were cooked just as I ordered them and the sausage was super tasty! Pancakes were yummy!!   My wife had the biscuits and gravy which she raved about.   Our table mates had the hot turkey plate and the bold burger which were equally well-received. We'll be back to Metro Diner. A lot!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Great and ample food, great service and great atmosphere. As good as it gets! The menu is awesome and it is always very hard for me to make a choice since I love everything on it. They serve the full menu all day long. So far I have had the turkey platter and the breakfast pie, and tasted the meatloaf. Excellent all around! will be back there over and over..."}
{"text":"Our new go to place! Great menu, service and atmosphere. We both had fried chicken which was yummy! My hubby had mac'n cheese, slaw and biscuit which was all delicious. I had mashed potatoes with gravy, saut√©ed zucchini and a biscuit which was scrumptious. We will be back for more and to try lots of other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend - everything I've tried so far is amazing. Chicken Pot Pie is my favorite so far!"}
{"text":"I came by for a quick bite and was seated quickly - which was just luck as the place was completely full on their opening day. My server Helen was excellent and very friendly!  I had low expectations considering they are brand new!  The food and service both exceeded my expectations and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service here is great and the staff have always been friendly. This place gets very busy at breakfast and lunch time, so I would encourage you to arrive when they open or just before lunch. The food is also very delicious. The food reminds me of the from my southern roots. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great service and great food...each time I eat there I become a bigger fan. Huge fan of the chicken and waffles but working my way through the menu. Be back siin."}
{"text":"My first time here...was an absolute delight! Food was very tasty...i had the chicken and waffles  with spicy maple syrup!? And the Mrs had crab cake Benedict with avocado. The staff was super friendly our waitress was great ( Ida ) and the manager John definitely made sure we were taken care of with a huge smile...very informative on all specials and deals. Sorry too full to take advantage of the dinner discount ! But be back soon."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this restaurant out. Finally a local spot near Summerlin! Even during their busy time (11am Sunday) we were able to walk right in and be seated. The server was very friendly, casual, and comfortable which was a nice touch for a diner (Alejandro?). The food was so good! I had the San Francisco Benedict and my husband had the Spicy Fried Chicken Benedict. Hash browns we're perfectly toasty on top and fluffy in the middle. Very excited to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Not only is there food fantastic there service is the greatest. Ask for Kiki she is so sweet, knowledgeable and fast. I would most definitely return to Metro Diner on my next business trip to Henderson!"}
{"text":"Went there for late lunch. The chicken is divine! And they give you a 1/2 chicjen.. big enough to feed a small village! I love that the mashed spuds are not fussy. Just plain, mashed with no sauce or drippy butter. The roasted veg was equally as good. Hubs had the roasted turkey and he said it was quite tasty. The people we went with had meatloaf ( he said it was not bad) and the other had the chicken salad and said it was really good.  I definitely want to go back for breakfast."}
{"text":"As many of you know Sharrie and I do breakfast out 2 or 3 times a week. Metro diner is the type  of place where you go  for basic great food. Simple straight forward good food. We both had bennies. Sherrie the Frisco and I had the country. Good eating!"}
{"text":"We had our breakfast last Sunday here @the Metro the chicken and waffle is not good and the pancakes are like ready made . My expectations were too high and I thought it's really good because of the ratings .   I won't come back here next time . There are lots great breakfast place here around ."}
{"text":"I was super just excited to finally try the diner as I've heard much positive praise.   Walking in we were seated quickly and everyone greeted us. I enjoyed how clean and organized the metro diner was. I enjoyed seeing the open kitchen concept and the diner seating area by the kitchen. The specials chalk board is really cool.   I was a little disappointed to not see a tuna melt on the menu.   Jason asked our waitress what her favorite sandwich was to eat and her response was \"lots of people order the metro club or the philly\". We just looked at each other and laughed since that wasn't what we asked. We wanted her favorite. Next we asked for a few more minutes and then ordered the bissel breakfast with a side of avocado and the French dip with a salad.  This is where we went from four stars to three stars unfortunately. The food was just mediocre and bland. The potatoes I received were dark almost black and I had to ask for another batch. They were very nice about it though. The avocado was not ripe and hard to eat. I had to add salt to the new potatoes too. Jasons French dip looked sad. Not enough meat and the bread didn't look toasted. Maybe they don't toast it though? The only thing I really enjoyed was the salad Jason ordered which came with a hard boiled egg.   Based on food taste, I would rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Have heard a number of good things about Metro Diner and finally decided to check it out. First off the place is a bit smaller than what I expected. Capacity is only 91 with a outside patio. I ordered the Cinnamon Raisin French Toast ($8.49) topped with pieces of pecan, and it came with 4 good size pieces. The coffee was very good and bottomless. My friend ordered the special of the day which was Meatloaf ($12.99). It came with 2 good size pieces with mashed potatoes and some veggies. It may not be the cheapest place but considering the quality of the food and decent portions I believe it's worth the price.  Glad to see a great really lovely and great place come to Vegas. To many places are overpriced and lacking in food quality and portions.  Will be back to try some of the other things on the menu. They offer free WiFi and are open 7 days a week offering Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner."}
{"text":"I'm very fond of diner food and this place had its good points and areas they can improve.   We were greeted right away and were given the option of seating. Our waitress arrived and took our drink orders and told us about the specials.   My Mother opted for breakfast and I had the fried chicken. The food arrived very quickly. Presentation could have been much better. Both of our meals were on plates too small for the amount of food offered. It made the plate look crowded and a bit unappetizing. My chicken came with potatoes, veggies and a biscuit. The chicken was well cooked, potatoes were good and the biscuit was ON POINT. The veggies we're swimming in grease/oil and completely inedible.   The service was good and friendly. There seemed to be a push for upgrades, soup, cheese on potatoes. Not necessarily the waitresses fault; I'm sure that at the direction of management.   I'll be back and try something else."}
{"text":"So when I first went here I actually didn't know it was a chain. You would have no idea this is a chain because their staff is personal, authentic, and ready to give you an original experience.  My one complaint would be that their host staff isn't always the nicest and honestly sometimes can make you feel a little not welcomed.  However, I always get their breakfast and it has yet to be delicious.  If you can get passed the stressed out staff at the front door you really will enjoy your time here!"}
{"text":"People hyped up the chicken and waffles WAY too much. Waffles were not crispy at all and the chicken was mediocre. I was so upset with the way my meal turned out, I was really hoping for better. The yo hala on the square was also way to sweet but the besides that, I did enjoy it. The hashbrowns were okay, not crispy enough."}
{"text":"Wow, upon entry to this restaurant they are very attentive. Someone greeted us as we entered, held the door and sat us at a table for two immediately for lunch (around noon). They were busy, almost every table had someone at it. Our waiter came over and told us about the specials, and took our drink order. While we were waiting for our drinks and looking at the menu, two more people came to check on us. (And we might have waited 2 mins for our drinks... not long at all!) I hope the wait staff keeps that up, because not a lot of places give that kind of attention anymore! My friend got a soup and sandwich meal and I got a burger with mac and cheese. Everything was good! Fast, friendly, and good quality! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The waiter was very friendly and accommodating. My teens are vegans. John made an extra effort to figure out something for them to eat. I even heard him comment that he liked the new learning curve they presented him. I would come back just for the service!"}
{"text":"Oh my God! This diner is the best.  The food is really good and the service is outstanding.  The manger comes to every table and makes sure you are enjoying your meal.  I tell everyone I know to go and have a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Best chicken in town! I was blown away by the juicy and flavorful bone in fried chicken and waffles with strawberry butter that looks like ice cream! Amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"We had a fabulous breakfast at the Metro Diner. The food tasted amazing and the portions were very generous! Jaci our waitress was so nice, funny and made our morning very pleasant! I wish more servers were like her!"}
{"text":"First time. Service all day bteakfast lunch and dinner. Impressed with prompt and quick service. Food ok too. Thank you."}
{"text":"First time here for a Saturday night dinner and all I can say is WOW!  We came here mostly because our teen daughter has a thing for diners and has had a cruddy day, and sadly, she's the only one in our family of 5 who was unimpressed tonight.  (According to her, hashbrowns were greasy, nothing tasted good.. I think she ate 5 bites in total.  Obviously, she's not herself today so mentally discard her pickiness!) She's still asking to come back again with us to try the pound cake French toast, so there's hope.  As for the rest of us -- teen boy loved his \"Challenge\" pancake -- and after that he dug into the second half of my fabulous huevos rancheros that I didn't have even a chance of finishing (SO MUCH FOOD!). I was absolutely smitten with my huevos rancheros until I made the mistake of trying hubby's chicken and waffles...  I have never had better fried chicken, their sweet/spicy sauce had zero appeal to me, but after hubby dipped a bite of his unbelievably good fried chicken into this (maple syrup and hot sauce?!!??) sauce and INSISTED that I try it... well, we're headed back (likely tomorrow) and I'm having the chicken and waffles (with strawberry butter - to die for!).  Hubby is planning to try the shrimp and grits - I expect he's thinking he'll scarf down any leftover chicken and waffles I have and end up with the best of both worlds.  I'm thinking he may lose a finger if he gets near my plate lol (yes THAT good!)  We eat out a LOT.  I can see where this place could easily become a multiple times/week habit and we have a good 25 minute drive to get there... Need a second location closer to Mint Hill (pretty please!)"}
{"text":"We're big fans of the Pineville location so we were thrilled to see one opening closer to where we live and lucky enough to get an invite to the soft opening today.  Honestly can't say enough good things about this place, everything is wonderful, the food, the service, the restaurant itself.  Today we met Julie - the managing partner of this location - and she and her staff really seem to have it together.    The food: (I'll upload some photos!) - I had the Yo Hala on the Square.  Delicious item I was really hesitant to try in the past, but it was amazingly tasty (and huge!).  Hubby had the Charleston Shrimp and Grits, also fabulous - I had a bite, definitely the best either of us has ever had.  Teen daughter enjoyed the pound cake French toast (it's her *usual* from the many trips to the Pineville location), teen boy ordered the grilled three cheese with bacon and tomato, and then after he finished his, he finished my Yo Hala and his little sister's chicken tenders and macaroni and cheese and his Dad's shrimp and grits (he'll outgrow this phase, right??) - and his opinion was that it was all wonderful.  If I had a complaint (I really don't!) it'd be that having a location here in Matthews really isn't encouraging me to cook at home more.  Not at all!  Full opening is Tuesday, counting the minutes - and I'm going back to *my* usual - because as much as I enjoyed the Yo Hala, NOTHING compares to their fried chicken and waffles (with strawberry butter to die for... SO GOOD!). Trust me, this is the place you want to go, breakfast, lunch AND dinner.  ****** Update:  back again yesterday and now (sadly) I've had to go gluten-free for health reasons.  Never fear - they have a great GF menu and were able to get me some seriously tasty eats!  I had the breakfast pie (I'll upload a photo) - eggs, mushrooms, peppers, cheese.. all kinds of yum and the fresh fruit on the side was wonderful despite the upcharge.  Hubby had the Monte Cristo (photo of that too!) because he has no gluten issues and he also was thrilled.  Definitely will be back (likely before next week lol!)"}
{"text":"We've been to Metro Diner a few times now and each time we've had consistently great service and delicious food.  Their sandwiches, burgers and main entrees never disappoint and we always have enough left to take home for another meal!  Hubby loves their chicken & waffles but he is a chili fanatic and declares theirs the \"real winner\"!  I'm the sandwich/burger girl and any that I've tried have been excellent but my favorite go to is the French Dip.  You won't leave Metro Diner hungry and the servers are always friendly and attentive.  Definitely a favorite restaurant with something for everyone!"}
{"text":"The food is great and so is the service! Be ware there could be a line waiting! That is because the food is delicious!  The prices are affordable ! I've had the breakfast the past 3 or 4 visits which is so good ! You'll find breakfast is hard to beat ! Eggs bacon grits (delicious grits) and more ... waffles stuffed with yummy fillings and other daily specials .   I finally tried the dinner side last night - I had the turkey dinner and the hubs had the pot roast! Both were delicious! The turkey was flavorful and moist served with mashed potatoes and gravy (on the side) and veggies grilled just right!  It was delicious! Hubs had the pot roast and it was tender and flavorful! Not too salty!!! The veggies were perfect and the the only complaint was who ate the last bite !  Metro Dinner is a Winner!  It really is where the locals eat !"}
{"text":"I went for breakfast. I had the biscuits and gravy with cheese grits and scrambled eggs. I enjoyed everything. I would have preferred the gravy be a little thicker and maybe spicier but in all it was pretty good. The grits had a good consistency and the eggs were cooked perfectly. My mother had a large breakfast, I can't remember the name of it, but it was way more than she could eat. She had pancakes, grits and eggs over medium. She thought all of it was delicious as well. The waitress was really good until the end, it took a really long time to get the check. I will be trying the diner again for lunch or dinner. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"This place has a Great eggsbennie and I think it tasted great but it was a long wait. The one plate was  presented poorly but that's because they had to make it in a rush and one don't have an egg, I thought it was called an eggsbennie  not a bennie."}
{"text":"This is the best diner around! Reasonably priced with excellent staff and environment. Food was just the bees' knees!!!  I can not wait to tell my friends!"}
{"text":"I've seen Metro Diners around the valley, but I have never dined at one before. When I saw that there was going to be one down the street from me, I knew that this was going to be a good. Diners are my kind of thing. Breakfast all day!/  I've had this place bookmarked ever since I found out they have chicken and waffles. I FREAKIN' LOVE CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. Growing up in close proximity to a Roscoe's (Long Beach, waddup!) has altered my idea of chicken and waffles for life-- let's just say that the bar is set pretty high.   Metro Diner's chicken and waffles were top notch. I wouldn't say that they are my all time favorite, but the fried chicken was damn good. The skin was light and crispy, just the way I like it. The waffles were good. I enjoyed the strawberry butter on top, it was a nice addition to a classic combination. The server offered to make me a spicy sauce for my chicken (how am I supposed to say no to that, I love me some spicy!). She came back with a small saucer and poured in Louisiana hot sauce and maple syrup. I had my doubts but wow what a great combination for the fried chicken. The chicken and waffles meal is about $15 and is a decent enough portion to share. Our table also ordered the pot roast dinner. It was a little on the salty side, but I thought it was tender and juicy and went well with the hefty portion of mashed potatoes.  Overall, I was pleased with my experience at Metro and I'll be back again. The table next to us ordered the cobbler and that was enough to convince me to come back even if it was just for dessert. The service was friendly and it really did feel like a neighborhood diner. Metro Diner is a great addition to Stephanie Street. I'll be back again for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I'd been wanting try this place for a while. We had the pumpkin waffle (a waffle with pumpkin cream cheese in the middle) and the kids breakfast platter. It was plenty of food for me and my two boys (11 & 9). They both loved the place too. The coffee was good, though I did have to ask for a refill after waiting a while hoping someone would come by. Our waiter was very attentive, other than the coffee ;). All was reasonably priced, I'd say $7-16 per person depending on how big a meal your going for. The food was all very good, and came out quick and hot. My son had grits with his kids platter and they were hot and delicious, which most places don't get right. Looking forward to going back. We got there about 8:30am and seemed to get in right before the rush."}
{"text":"I gave 1 start just to be able to comment. This place is disgusting, I don't understand how is posible that it is always full. I ordered french toasts, the bread tasted weird (like an undercooked muffing). Since it is always full, the servers are rush and their services is the worst.  Don't go there!"}
{"text":"Not so much. The deal breaker for me is that metro diner wants to charge $2.39 for toast as they consider toast a side. Service was actually too much of a good thing. So many people working that at least 5 came by my table. They did wind up giving me some toast.    Now me, I want to do what the competition is doing and more, not less. I enjoy a newspaper or something to read   Food was ok, not great and certainly not different or better than others   Looks like I was aiming too high. By the way Metro Dinner...a little season all goes a long way  Hope your diner improves.....when it does I will go back"}
{"text":"First time here. It was great. Our waitress Patience was on top of her game. She was cheerful, knowledgeable, and attentive. She suggested the croissant French toast. It was fabulous.  We also had the chicken and waffles which was to die for. If you haven't tried it yet, you will be pleasantly surprised. Can't wait to go again and try lunch."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch. They were super busy so we sat at the bar facing the kitchen. I had the Yo Halla on the Square-- challah French toast with bananas and cream cheese mixture inside and covered in berry compote. Amazing! My friend had the chicken and waffles. We're taking like a half chicken!  You can get your non-alcoholic drinks-- coffee, tea, soft drinks-- at an area close to the front.  I want to go back to try dinner!"}
{"text":"Wear loose clothing!!  A friend and I stumbled upon this magnificent diner after we finished a wonderfully relaxing morning of services at a near by spa (Natures Spa--AMAZING too)  We were fortunate to have Nikki (Nicole) as our waitress, the food was outstanding and she was just the icing on the cake! I felt like I'd known her all my life. She had such a happy, up beat spirit!  She was able to help us narrow down our selections after informing her of what we were considering and every recommendation she made was perfect.     Our feast included the Apple Yo Hala on the Square (This was a Sunday special). We also tried the regular menu Yo Hala on the Square and last but not least the chicken and waffles.  The Apple Yo Hala was AMAZING... the combination of the apples and cream cheese was an extremely tasty combination! We both preferred the Apple Yo Hala over the traditional banana.    The chicken and waffles were great! The waffle was perfectly crisp on the outside and light and moist on the inside.  The strawberry butter an added bonus!  The chicken.... ohhh the chicken... if you don't enjoy seasoned chicken stay away. This chicken had to be brined over night because it was soooooooo moist and was seasoned all the way to the bone! I have no clue what seasonings they used in the breading but it too was finger licking good.  The sweet tea was perfect too, wasn't watered down and the perfect amount of sugar (I don't like sweet tea that taste like it will give you diabetes)  I have recommend this diner to several friends already!  I will gladly make the 25 minute drive from my area to come back and explore more of the menu offerings as I'm confident I won't be disappointed!!  Liquor license should be issued in a few weeks and they'll begin serving \"adult\" beverages :)"}
{"text":"We have eaten here a few times and the meals are always good! Tonight we had their special. It was pulled pork on top of Mac n' cheese that was on top of a corn bread waffle. It was amazing!!! Very friendly staff. Laura was our waitress and she was very friendly, smiley and attentive! We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Limited menu but what they do, they do well.  Try the Charleston plate, I enjoyed it much."}
{"text":"We went for Father's Day breakfast and my husband had the cinnamon rolls pancakes. He said they were the best pancakes he'd ever had!! My father loved the asparagus and crab omelette special and loved it too. Chelsea was our fabulous server! She was super friendly and efficient. Actually everyone there was really nice. It was a great experience all around. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Monday morning and had an amazing time food was great service was excellent ,a special appreciation to IAN Very polite friendly fast and made our first day special. Coming from California it was worth stopping here i highly recommend this diner and say hello to IAN. if your ever in town fir a good breakfast."}
{"text":"First off...service was phenomenal! The entire staff was so friendly! The minute you walk in, you're greeted by a hostess. We were seated immediately. Following after came out server Ralph. Who btw, is outstanding. He greeted us and asked if we have been here before. We told him it was our first time. He then told us about their special which is written on a huge chalk board. It had drink specials, food specials including soups and deserts. He also told us about the menu and that items highlighted in green were customer favorites. He was very knowledgeable on the menu and also made recommendations.  He quickly returns with our drink orders. We were so excited I ordered a cup of their special The Minorcan Clam Chowder and  chicken and waffles, we ordered 2 right away not realizing the size portions. Omg! HUGE! So I quickly asked him to change one to a croissant French toast. Orders came out (and it came out quick!) There was a bit of confusion but that was totally my fault? Grrr..on my part! However, Ralph and the manager were so outstanding about it! And really it wasn't a big deal to me and my BF. However, Ralph was so sweet and said that they didn't want us to have something we weren't happy about. Which in our case, we just didn't think we could eat all the chicken, that's all.  The Minorcan Clam Chowder was delicious. It is definitely not your traditional Clam Chowder by any means. This Chowder almost looked like a chili w/ a tomato base. Chunks of clams, tomatoes and veggies with a hint of spice. So De-licious! I only ordered a cup which I'm definitely getting a bowl of next time around.  Before The chicken and waffles came out. Ralph had put together a mix of syrup and Louisiana hot sauce. As I stared patiently, watching the two being mixed into one bowl. Who would of thought...chicken and waffles came out and honestly, it is one the best actually it's The BEST I've had in Vegas and the portion size is HUGE! You get half a chicken, YES, half a chicken (mixture of wing, drumstick, thigh and breasts) w/ yummy waffles, topped with strawberry butter. OMFG, That strawberry butter though! So good! I've never had it before and I thought it was so good with the waffles, I almost didn't need syrup.  Everything tasted GREAT! New breakfast spot near home. Can't wait to try the other menu items, so many great choices for breakfast, lunch and Dinner. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken is the best I've had since I've visited the South (they make the best fried chicken hands down). They marinate it in the most flavorful seasonings, the waffles are so soft and good, not doughy at all. The service is excellent with every person on point with wanting to provide the best customer service, from the servers and the door greeters. I highly recommend them and I'm very happy they are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We were honestly headed to Applebee's and came in here on a whim. It wasn't busy and we were seated right away. Our server, Crystal, was attentive and served our drinks within minutes of us sitting. I ordered the meatloaf plate with a cup of broccoli cheddar soup instead of the vegetables. My fianc√© got the Holy Davoli Burger with a side of fries. The soup was so delicious... I could have ate only that. It was creamy and full of nice pieces of broccoli. Then the meatloaf came and WOW! Juicy, tender, full of flavor! Comes served with mashed red potatoes and brown gravy. I'm so glad I decided on that meal. My fianc√© was also impressed with his Burger and was glad we decided on Metro Diner over Applebee's. I definitely recommend this place and will be back to try their breakfast!"}
{"text":"Service is great. Everyone was friendly and attentive. They're quick to get the food on the table and everyone else seemed to love their meals. Me, however, not so much.   I had ordered the Monte Cristo and that's a dish I'll be sure never to order again. The turkey and ham were dried out and flavorless. The bread was overcooked and tough, making it hard to chew. Definitely a disappointment since the Monte Cristo is a dish that I enjoy getting from other restaurants. This is the reason I'm giving it four stars and not five."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here. My husband got the spicy honey chicken biscuit in which he loved! I got the Bissel breakfast. It came with pancakes, cheese grits, a biscuit, bacon and Canadian ham. Everything was \"ok\". They have a pretty big menu so we will definitely be back. Our server was Lamont and he was awesome! Also, we sat at the bar so we could see all of the food as it was being made. That was pretty cool."}
{"text":"I had my first visit to Metro several weeks ago and it was a wonderful experience.  Kudos to Steven, Lacey and Liz for their excellent customer service and making me feel at home.  Food and service were outstanding.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"If I could give a four and a half I would! It was worth the 15 minute wait and the price is pretty good for what you get. We got the Fried Chicken and Waffles, Blueberry Cream Cheese Waffles, Meatloaf plate, and Bissel Breakfast. The hashbrowns were only meh but their specials were delicious. I would definitely recommend the chicken and waffles and the meatloaf. I would return and try some other things like the crab benedict but first comers should first order what Metro Diner is known for."}
{"text":"I have eaten at both locations and have mixed feelings because one time the food wasn't that great (at the Tropicana location).  I got the chicken and waffles that were recommended by a friend and it's super huge! Way more than I could eat at one sitting. They served it with syrup mixed with hot sauce... interesting flavor.  The waffle was really good... I am kind of picky with my chicken so I didn't even eat it, the crust was just off it seemed.  My favorite right now is the chicken salad with honey mustard. It's not anything super special but the veggies are crunchy fresh and I really like their honey mustard dressing. The chicken on this salad has always been good... not sure why the chicken with the chicken and waffles was so bad that one time.  Sweet tea isn't super common here in Vegas so I order it here and it's always good.  This place has a large menu and is worth trying, I'm sure you'll find something you enjoy."}
{"text":"We enjoyed breakfast here this morning and ordered the chicken and waffles and the Frisco breakfast sandwich. The breakfast sandwich was standard (nothing wrong with that!), but the chicken and waffles were AMAZING! The breading was well seasoned, perfectly fried, and the chicken was juicy as hell! The strawberry butter was a nice touch, too. Probably the best chicken and waffles I've had here in Nevada.   Great service here, too! We were seated as soon as we walked in and did not wait long to see our waitress. Our food came in a reasonable amount of time and we were checked on several times before receiving the bill. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Googled for a diner, drive in and dives place and found the metro diner. It was great experience.  Busy lunch crowd, quick to be seated then the difficult part started.... what to order? You could get anything on the menu. Great combos of food, presentation, portion size and service. Mason took great care of us.  We settled on eggs with corned beef has and a philly cheesesteak with onion rings. Both were hot and delicious.  Will be back to try the board specials Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very happy party of 6 - four generations of the ladies in my family.   I do not hand out perfect scores often or easily, but metro diner is quite deserving of a solid 4.9!!  Here's what we ordered: Chicken pot pie - tasty, baked with a biscuit top Half a fried chicken dinner - very tender and flavorful Not sure the name but in essence a layer of stuffing, layer of mashed, several slices of roasted turkey topped with brown gravy. Maybe called a turkey waffle?  Anyway for sure the table favorite.  Also, the Phili cheesesteak - very good but I would say the roll isn't quite hearty enough   We were seated quickly and our order came out fast. Both Jamie's waited on us with top proficiency and a smile. The ONLY thing I would change is they need a traditional dessert case with Cream pies, bread pudding, a fruit pie etc.  There was only 1 dessert option on the menu. When I think of a diner I think of a great burger and a place you can meet a friend for coffee and to share a piece of pie.   Lastly, the portions are outlandish. That waffle turkey dish was a solid 3 servings it you had a veg with it (I see take out in our future)."}
{"text":"Their food is really good, however a bit disappointed they discontinued my Greek salad with the Greek dressing I LOVED AND WENT HERE FOR! :( sad face. Probably will return some weekends for brunch."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how much I like this place. Im a sucker for meatloaf and its awesome. Plus to know that they tries to keep thing local and make everything from scratch is amazing and get 5 stars in my book.  Like I said. I had the meatloaf and loved it. Well seasoned, not too salty and definitely my type of comfort food. I also ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle have a nice outer crust. Not to soft in the middle. And the chicken is great. Ms. B took good care of me. And she seem to know I'm the type that would enjoy a mimosa. Yes. who can say no to a mimosa. All staffs are friendly and accommodating. Service was quick. Didn't have to wait too long even though they cab get busy. All in all this will be my go to diner."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Chicken and waffles were super yummy!! The philly was so juicy and tender.  The butter that comes with the waffles is to die for"}
{"text":"Very good diner, it reminds me of home (NJ)! Good selection, especially for breakfast and their specials. The staff is always very nice too. Be prepared to wait to be seated on a Sunday morning/afternoon."}
{"text":"Got the breakfast pie. I asked for no meat. They apparently switched it with one that had meat. I had to wait for another one to be made which took forever. When it finally came, the eggs were extremely runny and undercooked. I couldn't eat it at all. Also a bit overpriced. Was charged 5 dollars for two glasses of milk. The server was friendly but not that helpful. Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Just dropped into this restaurant for a quick lunch, wow so much more than I expected.  Had their Chicken and Waffles- Oh Yum!  Strawberry butter on their rich waffles and a half of fried chicken golden brown and juicy.  The staff was friendly, the place clean and attractive.  It's in a strip mall,  it don't let that stop you. Very convenient.   I highly recommend it.  They do breakfast, lunch and dinner.  It advertises a place for locals, but I will be taking my visitors there."}
{"text":"Metro Diner was really good for my first time. It really seems like these guys are going above and beyond. The first thing I noticed after being seated right away was the sanitary packaging of the silverware.  After looking at the menu I was having trouble deciding if I wanted a traditional biscuits and gravy with hash browns and eggs or if I wanted something sweet like the croissant French toast or the ham egg n Cheese Sam which on sourdough with a white jalape√±o cheddar. Or even the chicken and waffles.  They all sounded so good and were very reasonably priced. The only thing I saw that was more than $15 was the chicken and waffles and the amount of chicken they serve with the dish is fairly large.  I like the combinations and options they offer and just like their menu over all. The biscuits and gravy I ordered were great. The gravy was very tasty and hot not luke warm.  The eggs Benedict we ordered were good too.  Good service , Good Food."}
{"text":"Would have rated 2 stars but service was pretty good. The coffee was a little watered down and they didn't have flavored creamer so we got the hazelnut flavored coffee. My boyfriend got the huevos rancheros and he didn't like it at all. Everything tasted of low quality and after two bites it was very salty. I went to culinary school for 2 years so I know what an over easy egg is and my boyfriends eggs were a little under. Not crazy under but enough that it looked like snot and I didn't want to eat it. I've never had to send back an over easy egg and when I told the waitress that they were a little under for my boyfriends taste she went on to try to explain what an over easy egg is. I know what an over easy egg is. They poach their eggs instead of fry which might have been why the egg whites were a little snotty unlike fried eggs, any way he ordered the special which was a breakfast quesadilla instead and again low quality ingredients in mass amounts. He was only able to eat one slice because of the grease. I ended up getting the croissant sandwich with egg cheese and sausage. Simple enough. And I got a side of home fries because the sandwich came with nothing. The home fries tasted like they were frozen then fried. Some tasted good but then you got a potato that tasted like freezer burn and the sandwich was whatever. I could only eat half and I had to add a good amount of ketchup. Jack in the box makes a better sandwich."}
{"text":"Finally had an opportunity to try this place and it was well worth the wait.  Excellent service, food, and very clean!  My wife had the chicken & waffles, my kids had burgers, and I had the 3 egg breakfast.  Everything was great and we each enjoyed a very different type of meal.  I did feel that the prices were a little high for a diner, but they also had very large portions.  So it wasn't too bad.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We had brunch at the  Metro Diner for the 1st time today and it was great!  We sat at the counter because it was packed.  Patrick was our waiter.... he gets the best serviceman award   I had the special, New Orleans Shrimp & Grits and my son had the Classic pigs in a blanket.  Food was fantastic and service was on point."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  Omelettes are huge and you get a lot for your $!  Excellent for breakfast or lunch. The service is very good.  Highly recommend Metro Diner."}
{"text":"Everything was just okay. We had the Philly cheesesteak and the meatloaf after a wait and a half to get seated. Maybe my expectations were too high but at the end of the day there was nothing special about the food."}
{"text":"Drove by several times, finally bit the bullet and went in for Dinner. He had the Fried Chicken with their spicy sauce which was amazing. Unfortunately one of his chicken thighs wasn't cooked all the way. They nicely gave him a dessert to go, not necessary but very much appreciated. I had the Holy Davoli burger....so much food yet so awesome. The burger was cooked perfectly, the plus was the \"lettuce slaw\" put the taste right over the edge. Great location, great food, great price with amazing servers a  very go again diner."}
{"text":"About a year after opening I thought to give 'em another whirl.  I ordered a basic, straight-up, old school classic:  two eggs over easy, hashbrowns, sausage, and coffee.  Other than my eggs teetering on medium, they nailed it.  An added bonus is they serve Louisiana Hot Sauce, which I prefer over tobasco.  Yes.  Seems like they ironed out the wrinkles from before, so I heartily say, \"Give 'em a whirl.\"  Another good diner to hang your hat while sipping hot Joe in a heavy, ceramic mug."}
{"text":"Wonderful! What a great atmosphere. Customer service is great, perfect spot for our family. We will be back. Classic food, I have only had the breakfast but it was great! Nice touch being able to get your own beverage while you wait. Truly feels like you are at home."}
{"text":"Jaci was our sever and she had provided my family with the best service and the food was delicious Thank you so much metro, we will be back!"}
{"text":"First time here. The food was really good. I tried the cinnamon pancakes and they were sooo yummy. I also had some of my delicious husband's cheesy gritz.  The service was great! Our server was Laura R. She was very friendly and helpful! We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Poor location, parking limited, food is standard and good but lacking soul. Staff is very friendly and helpful. But nothing compared to The Egg in Davidson."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. People are friendly and that's great. Portions are mammoth. The batter for some of the fried items have a funky, \"old oil\" taste. Went there 2 times, 2 days in a row. Got different selections but each time, that batter had kind of a nasty aftertaste. It's decent......good even. Just not great."}
{"text":"Good food and great staff. Always so friendly. The chicken was so good and the burger was great. A little salty but overall very good"}
{"text":"Food was great and survive was just as good.  They have something for everyone.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who eats."}
{"text":"Service was very good check on us regularly (otherwise would only have 2 stars), but the food was barely mediocre. Went with my wife for a brunch and she ordered cornbeef and hash with eggs, I  got the Philly cheese steak. I could tell the Philly was not grilled, but steamed like a french dip. It had a lot of meat which is good, but it only had cheeze. No green peppers or onions and, again, not grilled! The bread was fresh and tasted good and the fries were fine, but I wanted a Philly, not a French Dip Sandwich. This is a basic American sandwich! My wife's hash was mostly potatoes and very little hash. She could tell the eggs were low quality and not fresh (hard to get here in Vegas, but you can). They were cooked they way she wanted, just poor quality. Again, the service was very good and we were hungry, so didn't complain, but how are they going to change can-bought hash with too much potatoes or learn how to cook a Philly?? I would recommend going to Black Bear Dinner or Griddlecakes about half a mile away, both have much higher quality food for the same prices! Waiting for \"The Under New Management\" sign before I go back!"}
{"text":"Yesterday morning, my mom and I were running errands and we decided where we should go eat for breakfast and I told her...Metro Diner because we had never been. Once we got here, we were greeted properly and very impressed with the service and how nice and spotless and clean this place was. Our server Dakota got our orders right and brought them to our table right on time! He was just awesome!!! The Croissant French Toast my mom had was ridiculously good and I decided to have one bite of it...I was speechless for a second but it was just that good! We will most likely be returning for more!"}
{"text":"Ordered the meats lovers omelette. Decent and the hash browns were good. Food for a non busy time took awhile. Server was nice and overall experience was good. Fiance did not like her crab cake benedict tho, too fragrant for her liking, pineville location wins for me"}
{"text":"Me and my family came here on November 22nd and by that night me and my kids were extremely sick with food poisoning ruining out  thanksgiving we were sick for 3 days! Won't be coming back shame on them for not taking better percussion on managing the food I had never been so sick wish I could give 0 stars"}
{"text":"\"Comfort Food with Flair\" is their motto and yes their meat loaf hit the spot. Great food! Great service! Great music! Great atmosphere! If you are a local you might want to give it a try."}
{"text":"Food and service is great. One of the best burgers I have had in a while. I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The service is terrific, the restaurant is always clean, prices are reasonable and the food to delicious! I have had the chicken and waffles, as well as the chicken dinner, and the broccoli cheddar soup."}
{"text":"Late post. The food was really good and I really like the environment. Has the vegetarian wrap. Spicy, but very good."}
{"text":"Device was great.  Prices a little high but portions were good.  Tried the Momte5 Cristo Sandwich.  Was great picture on the plate but not enough meat and way to much bread.  Has three layers and only needs two.  Wife had pot roast and that was very good. Will be back to try some more menu items."}
{"text":"Wow!!! This is a must place to eat at! Ordered chicken and waffles, Monte cristo with onion rings, shrimp and grits and a hamburger! Everything was amazing! The strawberry butter on top of the waffles was to die for! Can't wait to try everything on the menu! Great service too!! Very excited for this diner!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy that my Mom & I stopped to eat here. The food was great! The staff was friendly and helpful. The place was very clean and comfortable, with a lot of room between tables (really important for people like me that use mobility aides like scooters, wheelchairs & walkers!). John the waiter was honestly one of the most attentive service people I have ever seen before anywhere. Go check this place out."}
{"text":"Came in for the 2nd time with a friend and we absolutely loved it. Our server Rachel was on top of it. Giving great recommendations and wonderful service. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and my friend had the Reuben. It is now his new favorite Reuben sandwich! Mine was also over the top good. A perfect blend of all the ingredients. Definitely going to come back for the chicken and waffles when I have an appetite. The Mac and cheese side was good, but not as creamy as my 1st visit. Still delicious even on the dry side."}
{"text":"Ok. This is my new favorite restaurant. I only wish they were open later. The place is clean, every employee very friendly. The food: I had the fried chicken and waffles. My husband had the shrimp and grits. Both were awesome!!! Food were really hot and big portions. Everything was very very good! Service excellent. I think I might just head over there tonight."}
{"text":"We had such a great experience here. Our server Nina was excellent and very helpful with the menu. She recommended the Chicken and Waffles which was amazing. It came with strawberry butter and a spicy sauce, absolutely delicious! My son got the Bold City Burger, and I was amazed that he ate everything. I'm talking lettuce, tomatoes, jalape√±os and onions. We've been everywhere and have tried burgers from many well known restaurants, so for him to say that this burger was amazing is a big deal.  We are definitely coming back and bringing the whole family next time. I'm excited to try more items on the menu.  I give this place two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"First time visit was Saturday 3.25.17 around 3:30pm after breakfast & lunch crowd. We were excited because of all the publicity and those awesome food photos!  My husband ordered Chicken & waffle while I ordered the fish & chips. The chicken was  crunchy & flavorful with every bite.-Great choice! The fish was good-was even better once dipped in The special sauce for the ckn & waffle-sinfully good. The disappointment was in the cole slaw & chips that accompanied the fish. The \"chips\" were cold-most likely leftover from lunch & the slaw was flat with no crispness. SO, for food-3stars. Service 5 Stars because the team was exceptional in trying to make it right! Bottom line we will visit again for Chicken & waffles!!"}
{"text":"I have found my new favorite place to eat. The service is great. Friendly and fast. Jaci was our waitress and we will be back to see her. She made the dining experience playful and relaxed."}
{"text":"Not a diner. A fake restaurant with unlike any East Coast diner food.  Too cosmopolitan for me.  You need to have ham and eggs, scraple. You need pork roll with eggs and cheese on a poppy seed bun.  Claims to be a diner, but not real diner food.  Was a real disappointment."}
{"text":"First and last for me. Ordered Spinach salad and it's really just spinach. The menu says Spinach salad comes with candied pecan, strawberry and blueberries and feta cheese and if I'm not mistaken, with bacon on top supposedly. All are missing except for the spinach! Good job Metro Diner!"}
{"text":"Growing up on the east coast, diners are a staple and looking for a good one out here is hard. This one is phenomenal and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Nice people, great service, wonderful breakfast, and crowded! We had a group of 11, our wait time on Sunday afternoon was about 45 min. We had adults & children, but we did not mind the wait once we got our food. I had the fruity waffles. They were great! From what I understand the chicken & waffles are one of the top sellers, but the fruity waffles can't be far behind. I recommend you try these if you want waffles without a half chicken. Yes, there number one seller comes with a half chicken! If you live near by or far away you definitely have to check them out! You will not be disappointed! I promise!"}
{"text":"Awesome! We found a diner we can say we love to come back too! Taste just like Brooklyn! Delicious food and great service! So happy!"}
{"text":"Yummy! First time, and Finn made sure we didn't miss any of Metro's biggest hits!!!!  Fried chicken... on point!  Hashbrowns...  hell yeah!  Don't miss the frisco Benedict.  Not an inexpensive breakfast, but if you get Finn as your server, it will all be worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything we have tried is good. My husband says it's best chicken fried steak close to us. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fabulous place for lunch. New sandwich was chicken tenders with bacon. Yummy. They serve healthy sides, not just fries."}
{"text":"Mother's Day Weekend in Nevada with my Family and we decided to eat here at Metro Diner which was the Best place we ate at all weekend. This place is Clean, Service is quick even though it was crowded, the Waiters, Hostesses and Staff was so Friendly and Professional. We all ordered different food items and they were delicious, I recommend the Chicken and Waffles, with Chicken Biscuit on the side and Peach sweet tea. The Manager was very nice professional and welcoming more restaurants should have people like her and that staff. Thank you Metro Diner."}
{"text":"Just as happy with my meal as I was at the original in Jacksonville Florida. I had the chicken and waffles, my wife had Yo Hala on the Square. We enjoyed it so much we went back the next day. I'm glad to see that they are spreading the goodness too many locations."}
{"text":"The Metro Diner is amazing we attended this soft opening a few Saturday's ago. There were 6 of us and we were all asked to order different things which we were happy to do I chose the chicken tenders and mac and cheese which was pleasing to my palate. I also tried the chili and it was delicious homemade goodness. My aunt got this salad called the Pittsburgh steak salad and yes, it had French fries in it and I know what you're thinking but it was phenomenal. All of their salad dressings are made in house we tried ranch, vinaigrette, and thousand island all were flavorful. My dad got the fish and chips, also accompanied by Coleslaw he did think there was a little too much batter to fish ratio but he enjoyed it. My mom got the fried chicken (she is a fried chicken connoisseur) and she was more than pleased with the crispy seasoned coating and juice meat inside. Our friend got the meatloaf and all I have to say about this is I can't wait to go back and get my own it was scrumptious. The staff was extremely friendly and even though it was their first night that were on point we never had an empty glass and our food was served promptly, hot and fresh. I recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone. They have a wonderful breakfast menu as well, I also cannot wait to try."}
{"text":"Today my husband and I attended the soft opening of the new location of Metro Diner. This was also our first time visiting Metro Diner and have heard many wonderful things about it.   Being that this was the soft opening, you had to make reservations and could not just walk-in. Being that we had reservations, we were seated right away. A lot of the staff was in training and had a trainer accompanying them. That said, nothing felt like a new staff. Everything felt like the place had been open for a while. Our waitress Jamie, was very nice and did a great job, even though she was training.   I had the Pot Roast with veggies and mashed potatoes. I am not a big pot roast person but it was really good. It was very juicy and the carrots were excellent. My husband had the Shrimp and Grits and they were possibly the best we've ever had. They were made with a grit cake, versus the normal style that is more like a soup. This is something that actually made the dish easier to eat. The gravy, sausage, shrimp, and grit cake were cooked perfectly and were very flavorful. Plus it had bacon sprinkled on it, so he was in heaven.   All in all, I would say the soft opening was a great success and we cannot wait to try more dishes they have to offer."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken pot pie (too salty). Everyone tells me the thing to order here is the meatloaf so I suppose I'll give it a try next time. Overall good service and atmosphere. Will return soon."}
{"text":"At metro diner once again John A was awesome and food was incredible thanks guys !!!!"}
{"text":"Metro Diner is always a good idea! Great food, and your waiters take good care of you!"}
{"text":"Visited first time last Saturday about 5pm.  Got right in and seated.  Service was ok, food was decent.  Kids meals were fabulous (which means we will be back)  Server never checked to refill drinks and I had asked another server (or runner/food server) passing by and she said she'd help but never did.  Finally our server came back and filled us up and then took another 10 minutes to get the check.    I had tomato bisque and it was awesome - they actually took it down from the soup of the day board while we were there - I'm assuming b/c it sold out - it really was that good.  I had cheesiest grits on the side and they were average - I expected cheese throughout and it was actually just melted across the top of the dish-blah!  Husband had croissant french toast - both kids finished their kid's meals and then helped him polish off his meal."}
{"text":"Toast so hard, that it cuts your mouth..  This place is mediocre at best. I really wanted to like this place, since it was featured on \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.\" So disappointed but at least I finally tried this place out. The service was okay and food came out at a proper pace, hence the two stars. If you are a person who actually knows how to cook, skip this place and cook at home. Your food will end up the way you want it and you will end up spending less money on ingredients that will last you days."}
{"text":"If you want a great brunch location and not have to go Uptown, this is the place to go! Their specialty is the chicken and waffles with strawberry butter! Yes you heard right, strawberry butter! I went with my family including the mister and my 2 year old daughter. Pretty kid friendly and they kept my daughter occupied until the food arrived with the kids menu with crayons. The service was absolutely amazing! We had at least 4 different employees asked us how we were doing and if we were enjoying the food! We will definitely be coming back! Especially since it's so close to our home! We are in love!"}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow this is a great breakfast spot! First time here and we will definitely return. Great classic Eggs Benedict, great pancake breakfast and biscuits/gravy, great coffee and iced tea, great service!   What I liked best was the teamwork among the staff, everyone helping each other out. The kitchen staff got food out quick, lots of drink refills. And everything with a smile, even though the place was packed and busy."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place! My food was cooked exactly how I ordered it and was delicious.  Service was outstanding as well.  I'm glad to hear that there is another one opening close to us!"}
{"text":"Normally I really like the food here but I am disappointed in the hot turkey plate. It's not real turkey and I am definitely not a fan of deli meat.  It wasn't particularly hot when it arrived either. The service was excellent, as usual and that is definitely a positive."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local spots. The customer service is great and I am a fan of their French fries and chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"I just recently moved up from Ft Lauderdale and was driving on Independence blvd when I saw Metro Diner. I was delighted that there was one here being that I ate the ones in south Florida, there were 7 of us. Well I was so disappointed in the food that I was so Embarrassed about telling everyone about how great this place was. The food came out warm the philly cheese steak was way over cooked, the fries just didn't taste good , well I can go on but I won't. Will give it one more try because I really love Metro but just one more."}
{"text":"I love a good diner spot where breakfast is served all day. I was torn though between breakfast or dinner entrees because everything looks so good.  I've now visited many times now and can confidently say either way is amazing. I'm particular to the Croissant French toast with strawberry butter but have also enjoyed blackened shrimp quesadillas, bacon breakfast croissant, avocado veggie wrap and the selection of side items are all delicious too. Every time I leave, I look forward to coming back again. Between the food and caring service Metro Diner win for me!"}
{"text":"Went and took my Son to DMV and for passing his driving test we decided to take him out for breakfast. On the way to the DMV we saw Metro Diner and of course yelped it. They received good reviews so it was our turn to try it out. The place gets really busy but we were able to be seated right away. It's very clean and has a contemporary country type of feel. Every employee we met was energetic and friendly. Kyle our server was great. The bussers and the hostesses where real top-notch. Even the owner Peter came over and was super friendly and helpful and it's good to see the owner out there helping and in the public eye. There are lots of food choices and I apologize to my vegan friends but not too many vegan choices. I had the oatmeal with bananas, home fries and rye toast with jelly. I can't say enough about the service as it really was perfect. The food portions are large which is great because who doesn't love leftovers. My son got the scrambled eggs with hash browns and toast and my wifey ordered the veggie omelet with home fries and rye toast. Now my food was great mind you would doesn't seem like it's a difficult meal but I've seen people mess up oatmeal. It was absolutely good. I then have to go with my better Parts opinion and she was very happy with the food. My son really enjoyed his food too it's kind of hard getting a real opinion out of a teenager but by the way he ate I'm guessing he really liked it. We all said we would come back here again. So Henderson Metro Diner good job! Two thumbs up very high! You also get the Boom Shaka Laka Laka Boom award 4 an overall five star experience!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! The menu has many tasty looking choices. While looking at pictures on the wall I noticed that Guy Fieri from the Food Network \"Diners ,Drive-ins and Dives\" had visited. My next visit I will try the menu item he suggested. All portions are wonderfully adequate! And they serve breakfast all day! My 1/2 fried chicken was just delicious!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner on opening night. Lots of staff and management was working the floor.  I had the chicken and waffles.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and tasted great.  The waffles were good, nothing special.  Huge portions. Leftovers for lunch. My husband had the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. They were very good. Mashed potatoes could have been a little warmer.  Good comfort food."}
{"text":"Finally made it down here and I had really high hopes.  The service was good, but the food was just okay.  To be fair, we came here during the dinner rush.  The food came out fairly quick, but it seemed my husband's  fish and chips could have used a couple more minutes in the fryer and my Mom's chicken pot pie could have used a few more minutes in the oven.  The best part of a pot pie, in my opinion, is the crust.  This was beige and soggy instead of golden and flakey.  My Greek salad was substantial in size, but the added shrimp that I ordered grilled tasted of freezer.  Maybe if I ordered it blackened, perhaps, it would have been better?  With that said, will give them another try, but maybe next time for breakfast in the a.m. (breakfast served all day)."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!  FAST SERVICE AND DELICIOUS HOT FOOD!!! Clean establishment... The biscuits and gravy was awesome.... The croissant French toast is to die for... service 5 star ... food 5 star!!!"}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips. Not too bad. The breading was light and the coleslaw was pretty good. However, their mango iced tea was too warm even with the ice in the cup. They must've added the tea before the ice. Overall, your average diner food."}
{"text":"Fast seating, friendly and outgoing servers, great environment, tastey original food choices, and large portions.  Couldn't ask more of a classic dinner with Vegas flare.  Yum. Yum tickle my tum"}
{"text":"first visit to this location. food was very good.very nice atmosphere. andy our waiter was great.  one in our party was gluten free and they even had delicious gluten free bread! we will be coming back."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite breakfast spot !!  Amazing, friendly waitstaff, fabulous food & cheap prices !!!!  We won't be going anywhere else !!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! The portions are huge and the food is amazing! Even tho this place was packed everyone was super friendly and fast!! Now to the kitchen staff.... wow the gentleman that is calling out the orders and keeping everything on pace is amazing! He is so motivational and not mean about it! The kitchen was jamming and he kept them on track the entire! Great job over all!!!!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant with a an ample menu. Food is standard diner fare: fried eggs, toast,  plain potato hash browns. Food came unsalted which is great if you are watching sodium. You wont find gourmet touches- ie home made jelly, fancy  dishes etc. other than the daily specials which were Strawberry cheesecake waffles, shrimp and grits on the day we were there.   Portion size is huge, and service is good- prompt and friendly. Food arrived quickly and was hot.  Diner is extremely noisy thanks to all hard surface decor- so don't plan on having a conversation.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"So I cruise over to flavortown today. And I was not disappointed at all. As you folks know, from my previous reviews. I'm a iced tea addict, and they have great unsweet peach tea! The service and decor is great.    The menu selection is massive. I'll be back again for sure. I definitely ordered more then I could eat. We got the chicken pot pie. And also an order of the Holy Davoli burger. This burger was a massive challenge. And the cool part was also the Mac and cheese as a side. I highly recommend this place for sure. You'll easily get you mom and pop diner fix!"}
{"text":"I'm not at all impressed with Metro Diner. From start to finish the entire dining experience was mediocre.   My Aunt, Uncle, and I arrived around 5:30PM on a Tuesday evening to a good crowd in the dining room but with no wait for a table, a plus. We were seated right next to the kitchen near the wash area which was very noisy when in use, not a deal breaker but definitely annoying.   My family and I ordered the Minorcan Clam Chowder, Chicken Salad Salad, Blackend Chicken fingers, and a ruben. The clam chowder was very strange with a sour slightly spicy flavor (I wasn't a fan but that could be of the chowder style itself, not a reflection on Metro). My family liked their meals but I wasn't fond of the ruben. It had a strange sour flavor that wasn't from the kraut, possibly from the pastrami seasonings and they had munster cheese chunks (despite Swiss described on the menu) that weren't melted. I ate about half and threw in the towel.   It wasn't great, but it wouldn't stop me from returning to try something different..."}
{"text":"there was a 45 min wait! But can I tell you it was so worth the wait! I love how they have the \"help yourself drinks\" while you wait & you can even take a \"to go drink\" ..... we came here cause we saw the reviews were good & it was aired on Triple D's (food network show with Guy Fieri) & I am glad we did! I got the Yo Halla (French toast with Challah bread, cr√©eme cheese inside topped with berries.. I looooooved it!!!! Not too sweet (I was expecting a punch of sugar, which I'm not really into it... im glad it wasn't .....) My husband got the breakfast burger (burger with an egg) fries on side & that was big & juicy.... I definitely recommend this place & If i am ever around again I would definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in the other day for a really great breakfast. I got biscuits and gravy and my bf got the chicken and waffle. You get SO much food for the money. It's a little on the pricey side but I took more than half mine home for later. They gave my bf half a fried chicken! The strawberry butter with the biscuit was really good. My sausage gravy was yummy. It took a while to have a server notice us and take our drink orders. Then it was even harder to get a coffee refill. This place would get 5 stars if they paid a little more attention to their tables!"}
{"text":"While visiting friends in NC, we stumbled upon metro diner on our last day! Before hitting road, we stopped to grab breakfast... the wait was about 20 mins but the staff was amazing at turning tables! We were seated and our server was pleasant and helpful. I chose the special which was the crab eggs Benedict Florentine, while my friend did the shrimp and grits.. the food came out quickly and OMG.. it was amazing, I don't like pouched eggs but this Benedict was incredible. The sauce was super rice and creamy and the crab cake was perfect. Not too much \"filler\" and had a rich seafood flavor. Love the fried bricks of grits, swimming in the sweet gravy. It was so good we were eating it in the car on the drive home.  I only wish I had found this place earlier in the trip! I'll definitely be back.."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Nothing amazingly awesome but just good if you're in the mood for diner food. We took it to-go. The employees seemed a bit crazed/frantic and too many people working on one order. Hosts took our card but it got passed between 2 more servers and both hosts went to get us condiments to take. All ended up well just took a while to get to the end result. We live nearby and will be back again."}
{"text":"The food was fresh, hot and seasoned just right.  The location was clean on the outside and inside as well.  The staff was friendly and always smiled when speaking to the customer.   I'm so happy there's a diner close by instead of traveling to Southend.  Can't wait to take the family there again for another great meal.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"The service was quick and amazing. The food was delicious. This place was awesome! I got the classic eggs Benedict and added avocado and my friend got the Belgian waffle. Both of us finished EVERYTHING! I cannot wait to come back to have some more amazing breakfast food!"}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken plate.  The chicken was terribly over cooked.  I should have sent it back.  Fried chicken is normally golden brown, this was dark dark brown.  I am surprised they plated it.  The mashed potatoes, veggies and biscuit were fine."}
{"text":"This is based off of only visit here. I have been eyeballing this spot since I saw that they were completing construction on it. Finally I had the free time to go give it a visit. The interior and decor fits the old school diner sthick quite well. Kudos for that but I came here to grub so onto the eats. They have quite a large selection to choose from and bless their heart and my taste buds, they serve breakfast and lunch items all day. The time I went was later afternoon and i was famished so I opted for the special which i believe was called the Texas burger. All of their burgers are 1/2 pounders and it came with fries. The burger was pretty tasty as were my fries, my waitress was really kind and made the rounds rather quickly. Even though i have only made one trip here, I am hoping to return to try one of their staple meals. They made a good first impression on me so hopefully it will stay that way."}
{"text":"The service is excellent! Ordered a dish with no cheese and it came with it anyways. We politely said no cheese. The server whisked away the plate. The manager said we will remove it from your tab and not even five minutes later, a new dish appears."}
{"text":"So here goes...recently my friends have been talking about how good the food is here, so I just had to try them out. While my friends frequent the huntersville location, I chose to come here because it's closer to my home. I ordered chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits, and tenders and fries (for the kiddo). I guess I'll start with my sons order, he didn't like the tenders. They were \"too big\" so the size of them turned him off, but he did eat all the fries. In regards to the waffle itself, that strawberry butter they provide is so yummy. The fried chicken does not come as it appears in the stock photos. It's clear that they brine the chicken, because it does have a dark almost burnt appearance. However after giving the chicken a try it was actually yummy. However the chicken was a bit dry so much so that the chicken wing, I couldn't really enjoy. In regards to the shrimp and grits, I was definitely not prepared for what I received lol. I truly thought it was going to be a bowl of grits with just a few shrimp sprinkled on top. However what it was, was something like a grit cake, smothered in gravy, with not only shrimp but sausage. The way that is prepared is not something I am used to/familiar with, so much so that I don't think I'd order it again. I would still come back to enjoy the chicken and waffles though. I do wish they were open later, as most nights I don't get off until 8:30 pm and they close at 9pm. I think if they were open late night or even 24 hours they'd make a killing."}
{"text":"We just ate at Metro and we're not impressed. The service was good but the food was dry and common at best. I have had better at chain restaurants. Not awful, I would just look for somewhere else."}
{"text":"Metro Diner has a very good, friendly vibe to it.  We were greeted with smiles three times before sitting.  The music was upbeat and the decor reminded you a bit of \"Happy Days\" but with a modern flair.  Yeah, I just revealed my age with that comparison!  Our food was delicious.  I had the pork tenderloin sandwich.  It had flavors that I've tasted before but not all together.  My wife had their meatloaf plate and the kids had traditional kids meals: mac and cheese and a cheeseburger, both with fries.  They have a good menu with a nice selection of breakfast, lunch and dinner items.  FYI, breakfast is served all day.  Overall, a solid 4 star experience.  Only problem I see would be the pricing.  IMO, the prices are high for what's offered.  I don't know how menu prices are calculated but instinctively I believe the prices should be adjusted down or the portions increased if they expect to continue charging premium prices.  Try it out.  You'll like it.  Just be sure to bring your wallet!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love diner food? I mean, breakfast served all day, hearty portions of deliciousness, country fried anything, it's just comfort food at its finest! Diner menus can always accommodate a crowd of different tastes, too. Really, I can't think of a reason not to visit.  I have been intending to try Metro Diner for some time, now. My boyfriend decided he wanted a cheeseburger and instead of just going along with his usual spots, we tried one of my bookmarks. He was so hungry, I think anything would have worked but we were very glad to visit here. Decent service, large portions and very clean. There were two of us, we had three entrees and two sides for $30.15. Not a bad way to fill you up! I had the 'Eggs, Hashbrowns and Toast', 'The Metro Pancake (12\")', and a side of Mac n Cheese. My boyfriend had the Western Omelet that came with hashbrowns and toast and a side of onion rings. Needless to say, we were hungry. The only comment that was made was, \"I wish the toast was already buttered\". Frankly, I'm fine buttering the bread myself, I like to have control of my condiments. To each their own.  How you pay was confusing at first. The waiter brought our bill, just the paper slip, to the table and wandered off. While I appreciate the time to finish my meal or hang out for a bit, he disappeared. It wasn't intentional because I saw him run around in the back a few times and it was obviously productive, but we had no idea if that meant we needed to take the check to the counter, or wait patiently for his return. Turns out, we needed to be patient. Either way, still happy about the overall experience."}
{"text":"Relaxing, family environment and great service! The menu is huge, with a variety of options. I would recommend the shrimp with grit patties :) Not what it's called on the menu though? Very kid friendly, and the kids quesadillas are crunchy and delish!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place and I am going to give it another try in the future. Let's start from the beginning I came here with a party of five and was told the wait would be about 15 minutes no big deal. About 35 minutes later we were shown to this tiny booth that wasn't wiped down that would be fine for four people not five. Not wanting to wait any longer I saw five seats at the counter so I said that would do. The waitress service was excellent she was super efficient and nice. The food was hit and miss. I had the San Francisco egg sandwich and it was perfect. The grits were instant and not that great.  My daughter had the loaded fruit waffle the waffle was good but there was not a lot of fruit. The manager could see I was somewhat annoyed at the entire experience and he came over and apologized and gave me two certificates worth 14 dollars each on a future trip to the restaurant. He also brought out more fruit for the waffle. Due to the managers positive action I'll definitely come back and give Metro Diner another try and hopefully it lives up to their average 4.5 star review on yelp."}
{"text":"Updated:  another visit tonight and unimpressed with service. Might be time to give up.  Ordered iced tea - no lemon.  Came with lemon and had a sour taste. Looked at the menu and asked if the sourdough breakfast sandwich comes with grits or hash browns. Yes, so I order it. Tried putting into tablet twice with tons of questions (do I want butter on my toast?  It's a grilled sandwich?). Then I go to wash my hands. Upon return - oh, the sandwich doesn't come with a side.  Would you like to add this?  No. I'd prefer a server who knows the menu and can answer my questions. Grr!  Side note:  food was still tasty and the guys behind the line are fun & friendly. Always check on how your food tastes and smile.   ========================  So I had a great experience here for breakfast and have had a few lunches here, too.  I tend to eat dinner a little late and they close at 8pm nightly so I usually skip this place for dinner. I was close by and early tonight though, so I decided to give it a try.   Well - not my best decision. Tonight's experience was a HUGE disappointment.  I'd have given it one star - but when you sit at the counter you get to interact with the guys in the kitchen.  They're always super friendly and strike up a conversation with you while they cook up your dinner.   On to my experience tonight - primary issue was poor service but also a little bit on the food.    Was greeted by the hostess who had a great smile and was super friendly. I asked to sit at the counter and she reminded me there were specials I could read on the wall before sitting down. She came over after I sat and offered to get me a drink. She immediately got my iced tea and told me my server would be right back.   Suzanne came over and introduced herself as my server.  She seemed friendly, too. Couldn't decide between meatloaf or turkey, but she recommended the meatloaf so that's what I ordered. I also asked for a side salad with ranch dressing to start.  I was told the meal didn't come with a salad. I said I understood and wanted just a small side salad to start.  Well, the meal came - salad never did - after the entree arrived I wouldn't have wanted it anyway.  Fast forward to the end of my meal. I'm completely finished - flatware on top of the plate and no leftovers - and Suzanne asked if I wanted some dessert. I didn't, so she left to go print my check. She returned - I gave her my credit card - she went to run my credit card and came back. Four visits now, right?  Well after all four stops, she never thought to remove the dirty dishes.  Pre-bussing the table is like Server 101.  I mean, really, the lady at Chick-Fil-A bussed my table at lunch today.  I didn't have to throw away my fast food trash.  But tonight my server came by FOUR times and never bothered?  I can look the other way once or twice, and I'm understanding of a server in the weeds cause I've been there, but the WHOLE PLACE only had four other tables.  Sorry, not ok.   On to the food. Ordered meatloaf, mashed potatoes, veggies, and bread. The meatloaf had a decent flavor. It's pre-made (of course) and then reheated on the flat top grill. It could use a few minutes more on the grill to get good and hot (the center was kind of lukewarm).  That wasn't really the issue though - it was the texture of the meatloaf. I can't figure out if it was loaded with fillers like bread crumbs, or if it was just over mixed. There was no \"meaty\" texture to it - kind of like the meat had been pur√©ed.  It reminded me of a p√¢t√©.  Again - the flavor was good, it was just mushy. The veggies were fresh and perfectly cooked (not mushy, not raw) and the mashed potatoes were decent. I thought they needed a little salt and pepper, but that's an easy fix.   Maybe it was TOO slow and the servers got complacent. Never seen this there when it's busy at breakfast or lunch.  I'll try it one more time; you should too. Keep your eyes open for my follow up review."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was what I got. This chicken is up there as far as taste. I ordered take out once and it was easy. Dined in once and it was nice and homely. Service was great from host. Waitress was attentive and produced great service. Would be back again to try something else."}
{"text":"Great food & customer service make for an enjoyable experience.   There is plenty of variety on the menu so you will be back often I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Metro Diner is surprisingly yummy. This was our first time visiting as this is about a 25 minute drive from where we live. My waffle was crispy outside a fluffy inside. I would have loved some strawberry syrup though, just maple here. My boyfriend got a burger and said the bread on the top of the burger was different from the bottom, I didn't try it but my guess is the grease made the bread a little more mushy. He said the fries were average, and nothing special. The waitress advised him to not get the Mac and cheese because she said it resembled boxed Mac and cheese. Maybe they need a little bit of help when it comes to the sides. We will be back at a later date, if we go to that area. But nothing I'll be craving or driving that far for. Prices were average too. Was $25 for two meals."}
{"text":"I am writing this review as I am still sitting in my table. This is my first time here. I had been wanting to try this place for some time now. My friend just so happened to have been here today from out of town and we wanted to have something to eat. As we walked in we were immediately greeted and taken care of by the staff. The place is pretty much empty, maybe because it's like 5 pm in the afternoon.  I ordered the a veggie wrap, my friend ordered a veggie wrap with chicken, and I order Mac n cheese & chicken tenders for the kids. My wrap was so delicious. The best part about my wrap was this strange crunch that was in it. When I checked, that strange crunch was actually fried jalape√±os. They were soooo delicious. I loved it. The mac n cheese was also delicious. We all loved our meals. We will def be returning again another time. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast and we were very happy with our meals. Everything was fresh and tasty. This is definitely a pricey option considering we spend $45 for 3 people. It's worth it if you want to splurge. Main highlights were the waffles and chicken. Next time I would definitely get the chicken and waffles. Looked really good."}
{"text":"Great waffles!  The friend chicken plate is huge!  Enough for 2-3 people or leftovers!  The chicken was super moist and crunchy on the outside.  The biscuit that comes with it is nice and flaky on the outside and soft on the inside.  It also comes with mash potatoes with gravy and veggies."}
{"text":"This place is fast and delicious!   Thank goodness because my grandparents and I just got done with a dreaded 2 hour dr appointment and was starving!  I order the chicken and Waffles and it was delicious! It came with 3 huge pieces of fried chicken with 4 pieces of waffles topped with what looked and tasted like strawberry butter. I should've took a picture but a picture was the last thing on my mind since it looked so yummy and I was starving lol.  My grandparents ordered the fried chicken sandwich and that too was huge and delicious!  If you get to choose your waiter, John was pleasant/funny and very attentive. He told us that our food might take longer than expected.  Highly recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! I had the flaky croissant French toast. The eggs and toast with hash browns. And a side of sausage. Server is nice. Wasn't too busy when I went but I would stay is was steady enough. I will be back."}
{"text":"A real diner.  At least to me, as it is open 24/7, has a huge menu, offers breakfast, lunch and dinner and you can order whatever is on the menu regardless of what time of day you are there.  i would say it serves up American common or American comfort foods.  The basics plus some.  REMEMBER to look at the rear wall as they have a chalk-posted special board.  It took me three visits before I noticed it, so it kind of sneaks up on you, especially after you have already ordered your meal(s).  Agh!  Service is fast and friendly.  Servers treat you as a friend, along with being efficient and diligently taking down your substitutes or special requests.  And the kitchen comes through quickly and the orders come in as you requested and hot.   The location suffers being on that horribly busy section of Hwy 51/Pineville-Matthews Road, so exiting the parking lot is a right turn only situation.  Entering you have to know where you are so you can get through the traffic into the center turn lane or into the right lane, depending on your direction of travel.  Portions are very generous.  Wife had their bacon club sandwich and we gaped at the 8 slices of bacon inside.  I ordered the Metro Club and it was so thick with meat and cheese that I had to compress it to bite into it.  Both of those sandwiches are a great deal to eat and delicious.   Breakfasts are what I think breakfasts, American breakfasts, should be.  Three egg omelets and you name what you want in them.  Coffee continuously flows into your never empty cup.  And...best of all:  THEY SERVE REAL HASH BROWN POTATOES!  Yes, a miracle now-a-days with restaurants offering pan fried chunks of potato but calling them hash browns.  To me that is such a rip-off and those restaurants throw away lots of so-called hash browns every day.  But not at Metro Diner where the hash browns are what they are called and are very good.  You can tell that I really like hash browns.  And you can order them as a side or with your side of French fries.  A superlative option for a carbohydrate addict.  Good place all around.  As I work my way through the menu I can see the potential of more than three stars."}
{"text":"First time visit for lunch and enjoyed it. Greeted by friendly staff and seated immediately. Our server, Javier, made sure that we got first-class service the entire time we were there. From making food suggestions, taking our orders, refilling our coffee, sweet tea and water without having to ask, that we had enough napkins, making a dipping sauce of warm syrup and hot sauce for our chicken and waffles (who would have thought?), to giving us to-go coffee and a box with the Metro Diner logo. With great-tasting, reasonably-priced food and excellent service from the moment we stepped in till the moment we left, I highly recommend Metro Dinero. Now it's your turn, so go there, chop-chop!"}
{"text":"This is a really nice diner, like really nice. It's unassuming from the outside, and the interior doesn't invoke the traditional 50's diner feel, but one thing it has going for it is the staff. This is especially true of a fella named Tim. I went with my wife and three toddlers, as you can imagine, our table can be a handful and is prone to sudden urgent needs, such as a new fork, 10,000 napkins, or another plate of pancakes (seriously have no idea where they put them, I'd look like a TV weatherman if I ate like them). Tim was responsive and exceptionally friendly the whole time- he even laughed at my dad jokes, which is impressive, because my usual audience is toddlers, so I lack practice in entertaining without fart noises."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the CHARLESTON SHRIMP & GRITS!!!!!! The grits are fried in a lightly crusted patty served on top of some delicious white sauce. It was super mouth-watering! Great atmosphere, family friendly, and a place to meet up with friends! This is our new breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight for the first time. Our server was Darla.   As for our server and our meals, will we be going a second time? OH HELL YES!!!!!  The service was incredible and the food was also incredible. Huge portions, so much I brought some of my meal home. I had the biscuits and gravy and my partner had the pot roast. We also had cherry cobbler and bananas foster cheesecake!  Thank you Darla for the great service and thank you to the cooks for a great meal!   We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"The winner of the Vegas Fried Chicken Championships has a new challenger with Metro Diner on S. Rainbow. As a fan of this buttermilk bird, the choices around town span many contenders. Let us delve into the Diner's entry into the \"50 shades of gray\" decadent comfort food (because white and dark meat together... no?)  Served all day, the portions we received were substantial; breasts and thighs coated in glistening golden brown breading, each bite emitted a familiar and satisfying crunch that would make Col. Sanders jealous.  The explanation was that these birds were placed in a secret brine for 48 hours, and it held up its juiciness throughout the meal. The delicious birds were accompanied by a healthy amount of waffles, topped off by strawberry butter.  Only time will tell which poultry masterpiece reigns supreme, but in the meantime, feel free to be transported back to the childhood days as the you enjoy every bite of chicken and waffle."}
{"text":"Hardly any flavor in everything we tried.  Salt and Pepper, and hot sauce can only work so much magic.  The eggs on the Benedict had rubbery whites and cold yolks.  And the hollandaise was much too runny.  Not the velvety, thicker sauce it should be.  Service was excellent.  Nice peo0le, just really super boring food.  You're better off going to Denny's or IHOP if you are looking for a national chain.  Eggworks, Cracked Egg, or BabyStacks are much better local chains to go to."}
{"text":"We have been every Saturday since this place opened and sometimes again on Sunday. We can't get enough!! My two fav items are The Pittsburgh and Big Ern's pork tenderloin sandwich. Though the Monte Cristo and Chicken and Waffles are right up there too! Really you can't go wrong with the food and the staff is amazing! We've always had great service with Ashley H and Jarred. We can't wait to go back again this weekend."}
{"text":"wow, just wow. Wasn't sure if I wanted breakfast or not, but after all the reviews decided on the chicken and waffles and was blown away. So tender, juicy, and crispy, and the waffles were amazing. Hubby had the special, a cheeseburger Benedict and said it was really really good. Kids had yogurt with berries and granola and the portions were huge. And finally a side of cheesy grits with butter that were amazing! All the kids said eer have to come here more often. Think this will be replacing black bear for us.  *Second visit, seated immediately, server was extremely friendly and helpful. Tried a couple of new dishes, this time the Frisco breakfast sandwich and the breakfast bowl. Both very good. Can't wait to come back and try even more."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and it was a great experience! Our server Chelsea was super nice and helpful :) we ordered the breakfast burger & the American omelette with two hazelnut coffees! The portions were huge so make sure to come hungry! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe how big a letdown this place has gotten.  I was seated at the table and waited to be served.  No one came to ask for drinks or my order.  It got so bad that I just left.  Since they did not want my business, why should I stay.  If I can rate this lower than 1 star.  This place would get a -20 stars.  I would highly recommend never going to this place."}
{"text":"Now that the management has changed over its seems like there has a been a noticeable slide in service, speed, and quality. We still love this place and continue to go, but it's more hot or miss than it used to be. During one of our regular visits two different waitresses completely forgot that they had us as a table (lots of miscommunication). However on two subsequent visits everything went fine (besides kitchen speed, but it was a slammed Sunday morning so it's understandable)."}
{"text":"Busy but yummy. We waited a while (weekend morning) but food was delicious & server was entertaining and excellent. Will go again."}
{"text":"Love love love the Metro diner! We've been there three times so far and have had a great experience each time. Every time we gone there's been a wait, but it's always been less than what they tell us (usually get quoted 20-25 mins and get seated in about 10) and we enjoy a complementary coffee while we wait.  Generally we've had quick service from the wait staff, who overall seem very knowledgeable and eager to please.  I've always gone with a group, and some of the dishes we've gotten include the Fried Chicken and Waffles, Breakfast Pie, Biscuits and Gravy, Philly Cheesesteak, Bissell Breakfast, and Yohala bread (they usually have different fruit varieties of this).  Far and away the chicken and waffles is the star of the show!  Comes with half of a chicken (you can get all white/dark meat or a mix which is what it standardly comes with) that they season 24 hours prior and that is perfectly crispy outside and wonderfully juicy inside.  It comes with this awesome strawberry butter on top of a thick fluffy waffle. You can have regular syrup but I highly recommend the sweet/spicy syrup that their server mixes at the table for you.  And at my last visit when I wasn't that hungry but couldn't resist that dish, my server informed me that you can get a half portion, which includes half of a waffle and two pieces of chicken, either white or dark meat. This was perfect for me!  I've also had their honey chicken biscuit and side of breakfast potatoes at one visit which was delicious too.  The yohala bread is yummy and a good plate for the table to share.  They also have brunch drinks (mimosa and Bloody Mary) and the drinks are quite large and cheap compared to many brunch places!  I highly recommend this place, will definitely be back for round four soon!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit at the Metro Diner. My family had visited another location and was in love with the food, and environment.   My family and I arrived around 11am to have a brunch together. I was immediately surprised by the selections of food I had to choose from. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day long which was a huge plus for me. I'm not a big breakfast person so this place was off to a good start in my books.   I give this place 4 stars for the lack of service and bland taste. I ordered the Avocado Toast which may explain the bland taste but the service was missing. I absolutely loved the guy that served us but we were handed off a few times which made it confusing when we were trying to order with someone. When we did place our order another person would come up and ask what we wanted and we would have to explain that we already ordered with someone else. I loved the servers but it seemed a little unorganized.   Overall it was a pleasant visit for my family and I. I will be back to update my review to see if this day was just a one off."}
{"text":"Metro for Dinner, yes and thank you. I had my mind set on their chicken dinner which I had the first time I came, well this is the second and I chose the burger. Oh me oh my, definitely a great choice.  I recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast.  Love the fact they serve breakfast options all day.   Their chicken and waffles with that strawberry butter is incredible!!"}
{"text":"My first time here with my family and the food was delicious, I recommend the chicken and waffles. Our server Maggie was nice, great service and the food came in a timely manner. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles is amazingly delicious. Definitely worth traveling away from the strip to eat here. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This establishment doesn't even deserve one star.  I walked into Metro Diner today with my family and was greeted by a friendly gentlemen--then shown to our table.  Our server came over took our drink order and 15 minutes later--still no drinks. Hmm..mind you, it's barely 4pm and there is only one other occupied table in the restaurant! For 15 minutes, I watched our server bus empty tables and stand around looking into space.  There were also FOUR other servers standing around not doing anything with their side chit chat. Wow! I can understand the wait if it's busy, but this kind of service is unacceptable.  I have worked in customer service related industries for years and I have never walked out of a restaurant in my life! As we walked out, a sarcastic server said, \"thanks for coming, hope you enjoyed your meal!\" Let's just say I will NOT be coming here again."}
{"text":"We stopped here and when we went in it was the opening for friends and family but they let us in anyway! I had the Cajun chicken pasta and hubby had the fried chicken.  My pasta potion was HUGE and the sauce had a bite but not too spicy.  Mushrooms right consistency.  Wonderful dish! Now the fried chicken was out of this world amazing.  The skin was soooo crispy and flavorful.  The waitress came out and mixed up syrup and a special hot sauce that was on the table into a little bowl and you dip the chicken in.  Absolutely amazing. Hubby had squash that was very thinly sliced juicy and well seasoned. For a first night they are open, service was great. This is a big place inside.  They also serve breakfast which Matthews desperately needs, it is vey difficult to get into a breakfast place after 8:30 am on weekends. They have outdoor seating. This place I believe comes out of Florida and was on diners drive ins and dives.  Everyone else was really enjoying their meals too.  We can't wait to go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Metro Diner is absolutely the down home family restaurant to judge all others by.  The food is always AMAZING, service is AMAZING. Peter the owner is always out on the floor helping and talking to the customers. Such a great restaurant we judge all others to Metro. I recommend the Chicken and waffles. Laura was our server today, we have had her before and she is always great!! Take my advice go to Metro today!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! It was a Sunday, so I expected to wait to be seated. Once we got in there our server immediately came to our table and asked if it was our first time being there(perhaps we had that look). After he brought back our drinks he thoroughly explained the menu and specials for that day. We both ordered the shrimp and grits, but I ordered the New Orleans shrimp and grits that was the special of the day. Phenomenal!!!! Our server as well as the managers were constantly checking on us to see if everything was ok. Very impressive. I ended up getting the chicken and waffles to go and it's the best I ever had. I'll definitely be back. It's worth the wait....."}
{"text":"Love this diner!!! Delicious food and Angelica our waitress was very sweet, efficiently and helpful. We are coming back definitely!!!"}
{"text":"First time I have been here.   Went on a Sunday morning around 10am with the family.  Had a 30 minute wait.   Which was not bad, given they had free coffee while you waited.    Quick turnover. Staff was very attentive, and the tables turned over quickly.   Food was excellent.  Pancakes, hash browns, western omelette and hueveos rancheros. All excellent. Huevos Rancheros was different.  Glad I tried it.    Would not hesitate to come back for Breakfast lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We were looking for a light brunch before a big Thanksgiving dinner and we ran across. The food was amazing and the kids meals were affordable and well portioned not to mention they loved them. The biscuits and gravy are ok but next time I plan to be more adventurous with the menu. Our server Jack by the was was awesome. Definitely coming back here!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. The pound cake french toast was too dry. The blueberry pancakes were awesome (per my wife). Coffee was good. Service was good and friendly. We'll definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"I had no idea what stunning fried chicken I would find at Metro Diner, but WOW, it is amazing!!!  Starting with my order: This very large home battered, fried chicken was bedded in a homemade biscuit, then glazed with a honey/sweet chili glaze. I thought that the price meant it would be small--like chik fil a.  Nope. Each was a full meal, so I took the second one to go. I did, however, eat all of my home fries. My love ordered an insane omlette and seemed to be eating for 45 min. This place is no joke."}
{"text":"Great place to eat home style food. Turkey Waffle made with dressing and served with mashed potatoes and gravy and cranberries is to die for!"}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant but I no l must say the food is interesting unique and good. The chicken and waffles was delicious and they serve the waffle with strawberry butter, which was just delicious. My wife had the shrimp and grits and it was delicious. Service was great and the server was very helpful. He made recommendations and electronically put out orders in at the table with his iPad. Great place, very interesting menus. I definitely have plans to come back to this place."}
{"text":"I love their fried chicken here.  I've had the chicken and waffles quite a few times. Whenever I think of fried chicken, I say let's go to Metro diner."}
{"text":"Service great, food very good, smiling staff, clean as a pin, fair value for food  and good location.  This is one of my regular places."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience.   My husband and I heard about Metro Diner on Channel 13 and wanted to give it a try.  Rick was our server and was very attentive and had Great customer service skills.  The food is worth every penny.   With the Chicken and Waffles you get half a chicken with waffles topped with strawberry butter.  The chicken was seasoned like my grandmother would season hers.  We took so much food home that was left over.  Great atmosphere also.  We will DEFINITELY decided returning."}
{"text":"Really great diner in the Florida style of diners. Awesome servers.   Loses 2 stars due to a few items I feel the menu is missing. Namely, hot cocoa. That's pretty much a Florida diner staple. Otherwise, it was pretty good.   I recommend the waffle. Best I've had. Bar none."}
{"text":"Awesome eclectic dinner. Lots of variety and friendly waitstaff!! Will go there many more times."}
{"text":"Thinking about stopping in to Metro Diner? DON'T HESITATE..GO NOW! This place is BY FAR the best diner I've been to. The portions are SUPER generous and the food is delicious! It was truly down home Southern cookin. My mom had the chicken and waffles and let me taste it...wonderful. I had the shrimp and grits...OMG the grit cakes are on another level! The shrimp are a good size and I was really blown away by how good it was! The grits were creamy, the grit cakes had the perfect texture and flavor (they're infused with cheese and bacon? Shut the front door!). The food was plated nicely, hot and fresh. Here's what made the experience exceptional...we had a waiter by the name of Marcus and he impressed the moment he greeted us. He gave us the rundown of his menu favorites, he was so pleasant and had a great smile, he was super accommodating and attentive, and we could tell he really loved his job and totally took ownership of our table. This young man even whipped up a special sauce for my mom's chicken and waffles that he said was \"life changing\" for him and...HE WAS RIGHT, then gave us a timeframe of when out food would come out (that was a first). First impressions are lasting impressions and between Marcus and the amazing food, we know we'll be back (and we're bringing more with us!!). I only write reviews when I have an out of this world experience and this was absolutely just that. I highly recommend that you give this place a try! I promise you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner special. Salisbury Steak, was allowed to customize my order. Husband had the same thing but the way it was designed. Grilled veggies were great, mushroom gravy could have made a shoe taste great, but the homemade very large juice patty was amazing. Husband said the home made skin on mashed potato were great because they were very potatoee and not full of other stuff. Portions were huge so couldn't try the deserts that sounded great. Service was also stellar. Pleasant and knowledgeable and didn't mind that I had to wait for my husband to show up and just had water while I waited. Need to try for breakfast but I have a feeling it is going to be packed on the weekends."}
{"text":"Love the food. Needed a great diner in our area. Breakfast 24 7.  Have an excellent pot roast"}
{"text":"After reading the online menu and seeing that they were offering a double decker type BLT with \"3 pieces of bread, 8 slices of bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayo\" I was sold that this sandwich would have to be killer....we phoned in our order as we were running errands and needed to be home, when my husband went in to get our order (the sandwich was ordered simply with no tomatoes, quite a common request I would think) he took a look and noticed that they had added them into the sandwich, he let the server know that it was actually ordered without and if they could rectify the error made, sandwich was brought back and when I got home to take a look at what was described to be FULL of bacon and bread, I got 2 pieces of bread like a normal sandwich, and scattered bacon bits with 2 whole slices of bacon and one lousy piece of lettuce....for $10 and being a newer restaurant on the block you would think they would take a bit more pride in what they serve (even if it was a take out order), I'm not necessarily disappointed in the fact that tomatoes were added erroneously, I'm disappointed that when given an opportunity to fix a simple mistake, workers who are paid to prepare foods accurately got upset and served a sad excuse of a sandwich instead....no plans to return to this place when there are so many other options in the area"}
{"text":"I like it here old diner feel, great food lots of selections. Chicken and waffles good."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here today. Nice, attentive, inviting staff all with friendly smiley faces to greet. Loved everything about my meal. The fried chicken dinner was one of the best I've ever had. Can't wait to explore more of this amazingly delicious restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here. All the staff were super nice and attentive. Definitely earned their tips. The food was as always pure American food perfection. Looking forward to eventually trying the entire menu. On my highly recommended list."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles are great service was great. Also the place was clean. It reminds me of the ones in Jacksonville Florida. I would recommend this place to anyone searching for a great brunch"}
{"text":"We found this diner using yelp and came based on yelp reviews. We are so glad we did!!!! The service and food was fantastic. We came in for a late brunch before heading back to California( where we're from). I got the Bissell Breakfast and boy was the amount I got filling. It is a traditional 2 eggs breakfast that I got with bacon, hash browns , sourdough toast and pancakes. Sooooo fulllll.  My husband got the Monte Cristo which almost made me regret getting a traditional breakfast. I got to take a bite and omg, we now know where to come to get a amazing Monte Cristo when visiting Vegas. We WILL return next time we are visiting Vegas and travel away from the stop just for this place. Our server, Kelly R, was wonderful and attentive. While most of our interactions were with her, the rest of the staff also seems really nice as well. We would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a delicious diner a little ways off strip. It is worth the trip!!!!"}
{"text":"First time checking this place out after a friend recommended this place. It's dubbed as the \"place where locals eat\"...I'm from LA and wish we had this gem back home. The people were friendly and very welcoming. Food was delicious. Luckily we had a big party so we all tried different plates. The Apple Yo Hala was super yummy and the egg dishes were also pretty tasty. Definitely will come back to this place when I'm back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ashley our waitress was super cute! Great seevice and amazing food.   I had the strawberry cheescake crepes and they were delish  Their country fry was delish too!   I cant wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"Just keeps getting worse!! I blame management.  You can see the misery in the poor workers face! Used to be a favorite place of mine but after watching the kitchen I witnessed  rather unsavory attitude from management I will not go back ever. Workers should not be spoken to in the manner.  No human should be treated that way.  Such a shame. Food has suffered as well and the menu has gotten just boring."}
{"text":"I've frequented this establishment twice and each time the food has been good.  The place, including the bathroom, was clean."}
{"text":"Wow... Heck of a experience here... Also an easy 5 star review.   We arrived here around 10:30am on a Saturday morning and the place was full. After giving our names we were about 3rd in line to be seated. There's a large beverage bar available and we made cups of coffee and hung out for about 5-10 minutes while waiting for our table.   In no time at all we were seated and immediately our server stopped by and told us about the specials available that day. I looked at my menu and knew right away I was going to have a difficult time selecting my entree. Why so difficult? Well because there was a ton of delicious items to choose from. My friends were having the same problem.   After a few minutes our server stopped by and asked if we were ready to order, we weren't. No problem, she offered to freshen our drinks, bring water, etc. and left us to decide what we were going to order.   Eventually we were all ready to proceed and got our orders in and I took a moment to look around. The kitchen was behind where I was sitting so I had to turn around and look. It was an open air affair and they have a counter with stools available as well. If I had been by myself that's definitely where I would have been sitting. I will say from what I could see that the staff that was working in the kitchen knew what they were doing. They were hustling and running like a finely oiled machine. Also they were doing it quietly. No loud yelling or drama leaking into the dining room.   After about 15 maybe 20 minutes our food arrived (again the place was full) and it looked awesome. I had a dish called the 'Breakfast Pie' which was loaded with eggs, cheese, mushrooms, onions, peppers and red skinned potatoes. I added bacon, and you can also add sausage or ham if you prefer. For the side I ordered home fries. This dish was incredible and I almost didn't finish it due to the huge portion.   My friend Jessie ordered the dish called 'Yo Hala on the Square'. It comes with two slices of challah bread stuffed with a mixture of bananas, brown sugar, cream cheese and hazelnut syrup, prepared like French toast. This is then topped with with a blueberry strawberry compote and powdered sugar. It was a beast! Her husband Dave had the 'Blueberry Crepes' special. I'm not sure what was inside the crepes but they were also smothered with the same blueberry strawberry compote.   All of these entrees were simply fantastic and photo's are enclosed. Service was also outstanding! This was definitely my favorite dining out experience on this trip to Charlotte. I see they have 2 locations up in Richmond Va so maybe I'll get lucky and they'll open a location in Hampton Roads in the future."}
{"text":"Where to start? Service is always on point. Multiple staff members stop by to check on you...you even see a manger stop by and check on you! (That is a lost art in the hospitality world). Have had only one issue and it was addressed before I could even say anything! Love the awareness! Food comes out speedy and hot! Chicken and Waffles, Crab Cake Benedict, Meat Loaf, teas, coffees, everything has been great here! Place is clean...what more do you want in a regular meal stop?! If you are in the area check it out!"}
{"text":"To bypass any of our favorite Charlotte breakfast haunts to try a new one is difficult choice, but based upon the its positive reviews, we decided that this four week old diner was worth the risk. Everything was excellent as reported. The food was hot, tasty and plentiful. The service was warm, friendly and attentive. Sanitation score was an acceptable 97 and prices were reasonable.   After a five minute wait, we ordered breakfast at around 9 o'clock on a Saturday morning. Both the hostess and our server, Nicole, were very friendly from the onset. We tried the Bissell breakfast at $9.49 and it included two eggs, bacon, hashbrowns or cheesy grits, biscuit and two pancakes. Everything was good; however, the hash browns, grits and pancakes were especially noteworthy. The coffee was also delicious and topped off regularly. The only knock against them was that the food took about 10 minutes to arrive which is a bit excessive I think. Still, the quality of the food made it worth it.  It's always a nice touch when the owner makes the rounds and greets you personally as a customer. As such, Kenny made us feel appreciated and welcome. As I told him, all he has to do is to keep doing what he's doing and they will be a hit. This place is a Gotta Try."}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was a great overall experience. Food was excellent best chicken & waffles I've tasted! Will be back....."}
{"text":"Great place to eat courteous service great food large portions Reasonable prices. Nick the owner is a transplant from Florida.  Thanks to Nick, Javier, and the whole crew at Metro Diner for a great Father's Day as usual the food and service was outstanding"}
{"text":"Roast beef was so-so.  Not fork tender, but a good portion.  Mashed potatoes were excellent.  The juice/gravy was salty but no other seasoning noted- black pepper, bay leaf, would have been nice. Husband ordered chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes. For the price, should have a vegetable side offering as well. Noted that the dinners did not have vegetables as sides which other similar restaurants offer. This would be a plus if vegetable choices were included."}
{"text":"It's good, but a bit expensive for such a simple breakfast.  Think Waffle House quality with a Famous Toastery price tag."}
{"text":"This place Delicious! There menu is 24 hours which is a plus in my book.  I had the Chicken Pot Pie on a Sunday, which I thoroughly enjoyed eating. The crust is thick and the broth is creamy. I was delighted to be having \"lunch\" for \"breakfast\".   The rest of Mi Familia ( My Family) ordered Biscuits and Gravy and also Huevos Rancheros.   We departed with a Chicken Pot Pie Togo and smiles on an early Sunday morning."}
{"text":"I just started coming by and the past few times have been pretty good.  They are very attentive and know how to make some pretty good cheese grits.  Today I grabbed the Bissell which is 2 Eggs, Bacon, English Muffin, Cheese Grits and 2 Pancakes.    The biggest reason I go there is because of the great customer service.  Every time I'm greeted pretty much immediately when walking in.  No Apple Pay but Samsung Pay works phenomenal and they are cool with it.    They have pretty quick ticket times and always include the needed condiments and utensils needed with my meal.  Interestingly I've never been past the front of the restaurant but the cleanliness seems to be pretty good.  Apparently they have been visited by Food Network before.  I know one thing and that's I want to try the peach tea.  I will try it this week.  I think prices are a bit on the higher side so maybe they could come up with a rewards program and offer coupons of some kind.  Consider turning on online ordering because your POS already supports it I believe ask your provider.    I think y'all are pretty solid"}
{"text":"Latest Metro Diner in the Charlotte Metro Area  Several months ago when we were dining at the Metro Diner on Independence in  Matthews, out server indicated that there would soon be a third Metro Diner in the Charlotte area and it would be in Huntersville. We were very excited because Huntersville is next to Cornelius and we were looking forward to the opening.  On one of our many trips to Huntersville, we spotted the new location at the intersection of Gliead and Reese Blvd on the NW corner.  Coming from the Interstate, It's Exit 23 Gilead Road on the west side toward the hospital but beyond and on the right at the light.  Parking lot was packed even though they have been open for only a couple of days and no great publicity. We parked and went to the counter and got on the waiting list with the hostess. We were told it would be 40 to 50 minutes so we settled in and got a cup of the free coffee and waited.  It was not 40 - 50 minutes. Our name was called after only 15 minutes and we were promptly seated, menu's presented and drink orders taken.  Our server asked if we had ever been to a Metro Diner before and we indicated that we had been to both of the two other locations in the area.  I asked if the menu had changed and she said no but this location operated with a Condensed  Menu so it was different from what we had seen before.  Later when she had time, we found that the two other locations operated with full menu's and this location and one in Raleigh were to only two operating with a Condensed or Limited Menu.  Bi-fold menu vs a Tri-fold menu still left plenty to choose from.  We both started with the Hazelnut Coffee. While my wife loved it, I found it a bit harsh but still very good.  I ordered the Turkey with Mashed Potatoes along with Grilled Veggies and a Baguette Roll.  My wife ordered the Potato Soup which was one of the specials of the day along with Philly Cheese Steak and a bowl of fruit.  Both of us were very pleased.  Turkey was thick and moist and the mashed potatoes were great.  Grilled Veggies which were Zucchini and Yellow Squash was very good but I will admit, bu the time I got to that point, I was full.  My wife has a new favorite with the Potato Soup. The Philly Cheese Steaks were great and again portions were so large, she is having the second one later for dinner. The Fruit looked great and a lot more than just melon.  Service was excellent. Granted a lot of trainers were present and we don't know what it's going to look like in a couple of months when they leave but for now, it's fantastic.  Nice and fresh as you would expect from a new restaurant although this was originally a noodle shop but the transformation is amazing.  Strongly recommend, especially to our friends passing through on I-77.  Very convenient to the interstate with hours from 7am to mid evening, great place to get a good meal."}
{"text":"Love everything about Metro Diner. Dine outside or inside. The staff is awesome and food is delivered quickly. Breakfast is served all the time, which is a huge plus, but so far the meatloaf is my fave!"}
{"text":"Waaaaay too much food!! Everything was delicious!!! We are STUFFED!! Great prices, immaculate restaurant and delightful staff!!"}
{"text":"OMG so glad this place opened on my side of town. We needed a good all day breakfast place with out of this world specials. My first trip I had the chicken and waffles with homemade strawberry butter and table-side made spicy syrup. This was the best C&W I've ever had! Hot chicken with a fluffy waffle and that butter has real chunks of strawberry.  I'm literally sitting in the diner now waiting on a table and debating what I want to eat and right now it's half the menu.   All I can say is, I wish this was a 24-Hour joint but if it were I would be 1000  pounds easily.  And Liz is amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Service was great, Bernadette is sweet and not afraid to make recommendations.  Atmosphere is cool with the cooks in view and 80's music (it was just a touch too loud for dining discussion)  prices were fair.  Looking forward to trying the Pittsburgh steak salad  (with fries, of course! ) on my next visit, today I had the excellent meatloaf dinner (totally delicious homemade mashed potatoes!!!)"}
{"text":"I've been to the metro diner on rainbow before, so I knew what to expect coming to this location. First, great service! Even though it was border line on over service because they had so many people on staff, but it's better than no service. I usually get the chicken and waffle combo. The chicken is always juicy and the waffles tastes fresh. Be prepared to gain a few pounds! You'll definitely finish the whole thing. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Metro diner since their first original location here in Las Vegas. This location did not cease to impress or live up to their standards.  We went there couple of days for lunch. It was a Friday afternoon around 230 and it seems their lunch crowd had just left and their dinner rush had not yet begun. This location had the same warm inviting feel as the other locations. Very organized and very clean and definitely living up to the standards.  I went ahead and started off with the mango iced tea that was suggested. Perfectly sweet and refreshing for a warm day. My friend had the orange juice. Definitely not fresh squeezed but pretty good.  I want to head with the daily special and had the shrimp po boy. The whole sandwich was a hit from start to finish. Perfectly golden fried shrimp tossed in a spicy mayo. Fresh tomatoes and green onions on a perfectly fresh roll. Served with fries. For $12 this is a sure hit. Shrimp were fried perfectly and not greasy at all. Loved the chipotles ranch sauce that comes with it. Gave it a solid 5/5  My friend had the vegetable omelette without the cheese. Fresh vegetable medley filled this golden fluffy omelette. Served with Home style potatoes. Everything went well together. The potatoes were \"rejuvenated\". More than likely prepared early in the day and then heated. Way to dark and greasy but everything else was great.  Great place for breakfast lunch or dinner. Staff was friendly. Definitely a step above any regular coffee shop."}
{"text":"The big draw for me here is the chicken pot pie. The fried chicken is good, too, but pricey for lunch. The burgers are also good. The atmosphere is a bit bustling. Parking can be sparse with a bit of a wait at times. I have only eaten lunch here so haven't been able to have a beer, but like that they are supporting a local brewery and offering a wheat beer. The Metro Diner is a good addition."}
{"text":"A Definite Winner. Good Comfort Food and Breakfast all day  After having read a couple of reviews from folks I respect, I bookmarked this place and made it a destination.  We completed that journey today and it was more than worth the drive down from Cornelius.  Got there right at 11:30 am were told it would be a 20 minute wait which turned into more like 30.  No problem. They did their best to accommodate customers which made the wait worthwhile.  We got seated right at 12 noon.  Very expansive menu with something for everyone.  My wife ordered tea unsweetened while I asked for 1/2 and 1/2 and good thing I did. I hate to think what the regular sweet tea would have tasted like because the 1/2 ans 1/2 was more than sweet enough.  My wife ordered the Pittsburgh Salad which is a steak salad. What do you expect from someone from the Burgh.  She ordered the steak medium which is exactly how it was prepared. Size of the salad is beyond belief.  As for myself, i ordered the Meatloaf Plate which is two slices of Meatloaf with Brown  Gravy on top and a good serving of Mashed Potatoes and Sauted Vegetables  Meat Loaf was a bit dry but had good taste and texture otherwise. Mashed Potatoes were excellent and the Veggies were perfect with just the right amount of crunch.  Very friendly staff and we did not want for anything  It's a bit noisy so don't be surpised.  Several minor things but not enough to reduce this great dining experience to a lower rating."}
{"text":"Love the Comfort Food.  Chain out of Jacksonville FL and one of two locations in the Charlotte area. Third to open in Huntersville off Gilead before Thanksgiving.  We had dined at the Pineville location several weeks earlier and were impressed so we decided to give it a try as well.  My wife is not a breakfast fan so we time our arrivals so that she can get whatever she wants and I still have an option for breakfast if that is the direction I want to go.  Pulled in, checked in and were told about 15 to 20 minutes. No problem and guess what, we were seated in about 10 minutes.  Good service after we got seated.  Looking over the menu, my wife ordered iced tea while I went with the Peach Flavored Tea.  Both were very good.  My wife surprised me. She who does not like fish or seafood other than crab, ordered a fish sandwich with a side of fruit. Double surprise in that she actually enjoyed the fish. Nice and moist, very flaky etc.  Side of fruit was a nice treat also since it was more than just melon filler.  I had the Chicken and Waffles and it was great although I will admit I have never had it served with Strawberry Flavored Butter.  We really enjoyed ourselves and look forward to the Huntersville location witch is closer to our house.  Generally very good except somewhat crowded but otherwise would recommend to any one who is willing to wait a bit."}
{"text":"Great place for comfort food- we had a super awesome server who made great suggestions and gave great service! I had this giant pastrami sandwich with an egg on it- I think that the only way it could've been better is if the egg yolk runny and not cooked over hard- but still yummy!"}
{"text":"We were highly anticipating the opening of the Huntersville Metro Diner location as we have had great meals at other Charlotte locations.  My husband specifically went there for the fish sandwich. It wasn't listed on the menu, although the other locations have it, and it is delicious. He spoke to the manager who said that this location has a smaller menu \"to get people in and out quicker\".  So disappointed that they are putting speed of turning tables above menu choices that are customary at other locations. That is why we can only give it 3 stars. This is an easy fix.... He ended up ordering corned beef hash with poached eggs.  It was excellent."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and was thrilled to discover this place had grits!!! Ordered the Shrimp & Grits and the presentation was so cool until I discovered there was sausage in the dish (I'm a Pescaterian).   Oh well, scrambled eggs, grits and an English muffin was prepared right away so this Southern Gal was one happy camper. All I needed was flavored creamer (which they don't have) for my coffee and I would have done a happy dance!   Good food, reasonably priced and great staff...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this diner!  This was my first visit, and I won't be back for breakfast.  Great concept, very friendly attentive staff, but my classic Eggs Benedict had no taste, and their coffee... isn't."}
{"text":"Inconsistency at this location -the food is sometimes very very good & other times not good. The portions are also inconsistent some dishes are a decent size while others , such as salads are skimpy . The Greek salad had barely any feta cheese in it but the Greek dressing was tasty just ask for them to scoop the dressing from the bottom or you'll wind up with all oil. This location needs to increase their portions other wise people will go else where. The sides they offer like macaroni or cole slaw or French fries should be of decent size -not a tiny cup-at any New York diner they give you an abundance of the sides that come with burgers & sandwiches & people go back & usually have lines to get in."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Metro Diner, it was delicious!   So when you have delicious food and a good experience, you want to go back but the second time it was not delicious. I ordered a Ruben, they forgot the sauerkraut and for some unknown reason, it had a hard boiled egg chopped up (but on only half of the sandwich).  It served no purposed and it just turned me off from eating that half of the sandwich.  The onion rings tasted like they were deep friend in old oil.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I love diners.  This one has a lot of different food to it. I had the shrimp Po boy and it was phenomenal. I want to go back for the Pittsburgh sandwich I think it's just a pastrami sandwich with french fries and coleslaw on it."}
{"text":"As a recent transplant from the diner capital of the world (New Jersey) I feel like I'm knowledgeable of diner ratings. I passed by this fairly new diner (about a month here). And let me tell you, the food was amazing!!! Super flavorful, quick service, friendly staff... litterally a great place to stumble upon. I am so glad to find something so close to home where I can have some comfort food. The pricing is very reasonable as well and the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"This place is he bomb .com I today we had the charleston shrimp and grits along with the kids Belgium waffle. The shrimp and grits were huge! Two ppl can eat off of it and you can order a half order. The waffle was light and fluffy and so so good. I'm definitely coming back again and again. There are so many other things I need to try."}
{"text":"Edit from 5 to 1 star. Was great but just walked out after our server was extremely rude from the onset. Then we watched him standing at a table eating with his hands. Then wiping them on his pants, cleaning his mouth with his hands and going to the window to get food for guests. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Service was great the moment we walked in. You don't know how much it means to be welcomed with a warm smile, and the smell of good food helps too! Love the decor of the restaurant too. Clean and nice! Our waitress was Alicia H and she was courteous and attentive. My first time ever ordering fried chicken with waffles and it was perfect. It's pricey for one person BUT it's so much food! You really could share it with someone else. It's literally half a chicken! It was tender, juicy and crispy on the outside. Love! We went right at 10:30 so there was no wait, but when we left at 11:30 the restaurant was packed which is a good sign. Highly recommend and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you want a place for a good price this is the place to go.  The service was amazing. And the waffle was the best I have ever had. The burger was juicy and the fries that went with it were saltier than last time the only down side was that in the bathroom the lock didn't work."}
{"text":"I think I have found my new favorite place to eat. Friendly service. Scrumptious food. The peach tea is wonderful and they even have it unsweetened."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Metro since it opened. At first, it was great so we kept coming back but the last few times it's been going down hill. This morning we went, hazelnut coffee again (not sure why they act like they change the flavor all the time. It has been hazelnut for months now) and our waiter asked us if we wanted to add any veggies to mix in with our crispy hash browns. We said sure! They made the hash browns and then slopped onions and peppers on top to make it soggy? I took mine off. Then our check came and we were charged 75 cents for each veggie. So a $9 meal turned into $12 because our waiter never bothered to tell us they charged. They also forgot to bring my crispy bacon so it was rushed and soft when it came. $27 dollars for two meals. No thanks, we will go back to Toast."}
{"text":"Today was my 5th but far from last visit to Metro Diner.  What do I love about this diner?   Breakfast!!! The waffles, omelettes, biscuits and gravy! Also they have mimosas and a special flavored coffee of the day  The service is some of the best I've ever seen in Matthews. Friendly, attentive, and very quick to follow up on drink refills ( I mention the latter because I hate to run out of my tea/coffee ). The diner is almost always full, the food comes out within 15-20 minutes of ordering and always hot. The tomato bisque soup needs to be in a store shelf so I can buy it by the gallon!!! It's really that creamy and delicious. And don't get me started on the portion sizes , Yowza!!! I just automatically ask for a to go container because there is no finishing any of the dishes I've ordered. Sunday's seem to be the busiest day with a wait, there is also a nice heated patio to take advantage of during the busy times."}
{"text":"Breakfast is good, not too expensive. They have good choices for kids. The service is usually pretty great. Lunch and dinner options are not super but will do if you have no other place to go. We prefer the breakfast. The weight can get long after 930 or 10 AM."}
{"text":"I really like this place so far... My goal is to try everything one the menu... so far i've had breakfast omelets and the chicken and waffles. They were all good!!! so now we know that the morning stuff is good i'm gonna venture on to lunch/dinner. At the moment they have my 4 star approval. Service is \"off the hook\" they get a A++ from me. Check this place out ... you might like it"}
{"text":"I had the crab Benedict with hashbrowns. It was tasty and a large proportion. The manager came around twice to check on us. The waitress was also very attentive and helpful. The reason for 3 stars is mainly because my husband's order was messed up. He ordered the spicy chicken Benedict. It wasn't spicy, the bacon and green onion topping was missing, and the manager never stopped back by like the waitress said she would. I don't blame the waitress for any of these missteps as she did a really good job and apologized twice for the mistakes. We'll possibly try again sometime in the future."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I tried this place out on a whim, as the restaurant we intended on going to closed early due to the Mayweather fight. Diners are hit, or miss, and Metro Diner was definitely a hit. Our waitress was extremely friendly, and made sure our first experience was a good one. I ordered the Avocado Veggie Wrap with regular jalape√±os instead of fried ones, and a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette. Both the wrap, and side salad were filling, and full of flavor. I really enjoyed the balsamic vinaigrette they had, and you could tell it was homemade rather than store bought. My boyfriend ordered the Fried Chicken Plate with macaroni & cheese. My boyfriend is picky with his fried chicken, and luckily, this meal earned his stamp of approval. The waitress mixed together syrup and hot sauce as a sauce for him to dip his chicken in, which also delicious. Metro Diner is reasonably priced, and has a great variety of food to choose from. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite food and the Metro Diner is some of the best. While on our way out of Vegas, we stopped for breakfast. So many options from waffles, pancakes, omelets, to chicken and waffles, breakfast sandwiches, heuvos rancheros, and avocado toast. So many delicious choices. And you can order from the whole menu the whole day.  I ordered the Fruity Belgian waffle; a fluffy waffle covered in fresh strawberries, blueberries, and bananas. I ordered it without bananas. It was sweet without being cloyingly sweet. The warm syrup was perfect with it.  Others in our party ordered the kids breakfast platter, Philly cheesesteak, cheesy grits with bacon and eggs, croissant French toast, and kids silver dollar pancakes. My husband loved that they had grits even though we aren't in the south. Everyone left full and happy.  Service was also top notch."}
{"text":"From start to finish...this is how you run a restaurant.   The Service - incredible! Gracious, kind and always willing to help. Knowledgable staff and always welcoming.   The food - off the CHARTS!!! - breakfast, one of my favorite spots in town. I usually get the special but haven't had anything I would feel bad recommending. The fried chicken is the best I have ever had...  From start to finish...the best spot in town!!!"}
{"text":"Just ate here with my parents and what a great choice we made ! We got a side of onion rings as a quick app and they were perfect! Not overly battered and were excellent ! Please note, we had already devoured 2/3 of the onion rings before I took this pic! So Plenty for us three! Entrees: American burger with bacon- excellent and huge  Pot roast - perfect according to my dad who couldn't but half  Fish and chips - my mom said the batter used was tasty and she would review her whole meal, slaw included as excellent! Service was great! Friendly hostess who took care of us right away, and our server Liz was just as delightful and so wonderful the entire time ! She was so pleasant and offered advice that we followed and weren't let down. Will be back and hope to try the breakfast items next time! thanks MetroDiner. Matthews is thankful you're here !"}
{"text":"I hate to give this diner three stars because the staff are SOOO nice and friendly! The service is five star but the food is one star. I had the Salisbury steak special. It was so salty I'm sure the salt lid came off and the  shaker fell into the gravy pot. I could hardly eat it and it was really greasy. The mashed potatoes were like a thick linoleum paste but not as flavorful. The squash looked as though it had been painted with Crisco and seared with a blowtorch. The bread was like eating a butter-smeared luffa sponge you forgot about under the sink for three years.  There was serious trouble in Tummy Town for 48 hours.  Great place to stop in and have a sweet tea but eat the food at your own risk.  Greatly appreciate manager's comments. We might have caught the cook on a bad night. We will definitely give the diner another shot! Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"been to this location twice since I live right over there, um I cant say its the greatest place ive been to  but its good.  food was kind of average, fresh, atmosphere nice, clean , friendly staff for the most part but  one thing I did not like is our server did not return at all so my kids were dying of thirst, only time the server came back was to deliver my check.   but overall I would probably go back."}
{"text":"I enjoy this spot!  Open 24 hours, mashed potatoes, chicken n waffles, shrimp and grits, A-Mazing and homemade. Open 24 hrs and the only place you can get a crown and coke with your pancakes"}
{"text":"I was too excited to try your restaurant only to be disappointed...and it's unfortunate because it wasn't because of the food it was the to go person response to my concerns about being on hold for ten minutes irrelevant since her other in house guests come first?!? I'm just in disbelief. And the sad thing is that my coworkers are in love with your establishment."}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab fresh diner entrees for lunch & dinner! Breakfast hasn't been a solid win for me here but I have only tried 1 menu item (the Breakfast Pie) && tried to make it vegan... failed miserably. Everything else I've ever had (especially the fish n' chips & onion rings) was great as far as quality & freshness is concerned!!"}
{"text":"I loved the retro feel in this diner, especially the black and white tile flooring!  When we walked in, someone from the back shouted at us to choose any open spot. We usually prefer booths so we chose a booth. I liked that we could choose our spot. There were already menus at our table, which I also liked. Our waitress greeted us quickly after we sat down and got us our waters.   She asked us if it was our first time and since it was, she informed us of their specials and what not. That was nice.   I almost ordered $20 worth of food just for myself but she helped me get what I wanted for half the price by showing me a different option on the menu. I wish I caught her name.   I ordered the Bissell Breakfast it came w/ bacon but I swapped for sausage links, 'home fries', 2 over-easy eggs, wheat toast, and a short stack of pancakes that I swapped for 2 slices of their croissant french toast. Everything was really good!! Probably the best diner breakfast food I've ever had in Vegas. I've never had a croissant french toast before but I'd prefer all the future french toast I consume to be made w/ croissants.  I asked for peanut butter for my wheat and french toast, it costs an extra .50 cents or something, which is kinda lame since lots of other diners offer unlimited PB for free. PB is a necessity as much as syrup to me for breakfast!!   My boyfriend ordered the Bold City Burger with regular fries. We saw his burger was ready several minutes before my breakfast plate and would have preferred that they have brought it to our table right away instead of letting it sit there for such a long while. Anyways, the meat was cooked perfectly, medium rare, but I do assume it all would have been better if we were given the burger and fries right away. All of it was room temperature not fresh and super warm like my breakfast was.   In my opinion, they close hella early! At 8pm?! If I lived closer, I'd definitely frequent this diner as long as I could make it before 8pm, though I rarely ever eat dinner before 8pm."}
{"text":"One of the best Diners in Charlotte! Food always fresh. The  specials are creative and delicious."}
{"text":"Besides watching the staff bicker with one another in a very open food pick up area, the service was cool! The fried chicken was lacking, waffles were excellent. Portions of the eggs and bacon large."}
{"text":"Busy place, large portions avg staff and pricing is a little heavy.   Due to location, we will be back as the menu is large.   Bar seating is uncomfortable.     Food quality is pretty decent."}
{"text":"This is a happy, and cute diner! The good customer service, the good food, and the comfy vibe makes the whole place a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"This review is for Tony A who answers reviews. We have been eating at the Serene location quite frequently. The food is decent and portions are good. What is inconsistent is the service. Some servers (waitresses especially) are super nice and so friendly. But there are a couple with attitudes.  Once I barely got my change for a $20 and she came and gave it to me out of the same type of bill  holder you give to customers. I had brought a $20 up to the counter and asked her to bring me a $10. Instead after taking her sweet time-she finally came to the table where I had to remind her. Do they share tips there or pocket them as soon as they get them?  Another time my friend made a comment and was over heard by (not our server) but another waitress who had to gossip and tell our server what she heard. Because our server came over and confronted us to ask if we wanted to change servers. I do not blame the woman who served us and she has since waited on us. I think the other waitress was stirring up trouble and it makes me wonder if they are competing for tips there. I see some people doing the job above and beyond and others slacking. That's my feedback."}
{"text":"Where do i start with this amazing diner?! I had the chicken dinner and it was MASSIVE!! It literally took 3 sittings to finish this meal!! The chicken was a perfect crisp and sooo juicy! You can tell that it came straight from the fryer too! The homemade mashed potatoes and gravy  were a delight so was the homemade biscuit. I didn't really care for the Mac n cheese. I was actually dissatisfied with it. It was not oven baked and it tasted like it came from a box. Surprised too since everything else was from scratch. My husband had the chicken and waffles with strawberry butter! There was actually fresh strawberries in there...yummmm! I totally recommend and will be back when i visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"my wife and i went for breakfast this morning. we arrived about 9:15. the dining room was relatively empty. we ordered right away, yet it took 20 mins for our food to show up. many servers were just standing around talking.   when our food finally showed up the waitress told me my english muffin was burned so they were making a new one. that took another 7 minutes and when it came it wasn't toasted. i asked that she send it back to be toasted and she told me it WAS toasted!  i didn't even respond.   i ordered poached eggs over corned beef hash. the eggs came in a little dish that had water in it. the CB hash was tasteless.   this is the second time i visited the Metro Diner. it will be my last. the last thing i want when i dine out is to butt heads with the wait staff. i have dined out my entire life, i know the difference between toasted and not"}
{"text":"Ordered the Cajun fish special and huevos rancheros.  Fish was overcooked, sauce was ok, saut√©ed veggies were good.  Huevos rancheros the tortillas were burned/black, surprised they served them.  Otherwise the flavor and quality of that dish was good but the ratio of toppings to the tortillas was poor, not enough to get spread around.  Brocolli cheddar soup was surprisingly thick but tasted good, served on the cold side though even though specifically asked for the soup to come hot. Service was good but they didn't bring any napkins to the table and didn't check on us for a long time so we could let them know.  Has potential but will not go back soon."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, seating was almost immediate, staff are cheerful and pleasant, knowledgeable as to menu items.  Food was delicious and plentiful!  Will be one of our go to places for weekend breakfast!!"}
{"text":"I've been so excited to try this. Came on a Sunday evening and easy to get in and seated. They have a really neat idea of a beverage buffet to help yourself with coffees, teas, sodas... $2.50. I had the eggs Benedict with spinach and tomato.. cali? I have to say, it rates quite highly on the Benedict scale. I'd say better than Toast. The portion size was generous and they put a good amount of hollandaise sauce. (It's my pet peeve when they don't put enough and eggs Benny is dry.) great flavor of each component. My daughter got the chicken pot pie.. we were very impressed!! The creamy inside was perfectly complimented with the homemade biscuit on top that was so yummy we are going to try biscuits and gravy for the first time in our lives next time!  Wonderful, comfortable, good to bring grandma and the kids. Can't wait to try more items!"}
{"text":"One Star as the Waitress was nice .....  She did not cook the horrible \" Metro Melt\" That took a cook who obviously doesn't care.  'Metro Melt' it was soggy and disgusting Top side of bread was crispy - bottom side was soggy - it may have sat around awhile as the sandwich was not very hot ... luke warm at best  How does a diner screw up a ' Patty Melt' ... well they found a way  I asked for Onion Rings \" WELL DONE\"  they were partially cooked and raw inside  Disgusting!!  I'm not sure if I will try this place again  If they can't do basic diner patty melt and onion rings ..."}
{"text":"Great diner located just down from Carolina Place Mall. We arrived around 7:30 for a late dinner (they close at 8 during the week), we we're promptly greeted and seated in a booth. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items. I ordered a Belgian Waffle, my husband ordered eggs with sausage and bacon, and our son got the kids chicken fingers with fruit. Our food arrived quickly and was delicious. The chicken fingers tasted just like fried chicken! The waffle was golden with just the right amount of crispiness on the outside and fluffy in the middle - make sure you try the strawberry butter with your waffle. I shared my husband's bacon, which was perfectly cooked. I will definitely be back to try the crossiant french toast!"}
{"text":"So here we are,back again. My wife wanted to go someplace reasonable for dinner. My first glance at the menu left me wondering why we were here at all. I really didn't see anything worth eating but finally decided on the Holy Davoli burger, god help me. It was the only item that sounded like an extreme helping of food. And it was... The only problem was that it had no flavor. I'm used to a grilled cheese sandwich oozing cheese. These grilled cheese were the type where you had to go in search of the cheese as it was hidden by tomatoes and bacon. The burger was good. Whatever the sauce was, wasn't memorable."}
{"text":"LOVED this place!  The chicken & waffles were amazing!  We also liked the syrup with hot sauce to use on the chicken, what a simple yet genius idea.  Large portions, even our high school football players couldn't finish their meals."}
{"text":"Love the food and the service! Everyone is HAPPY and smiling. They will make you feel at home with AMAZING food. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Very good find. The Yo Hala was delicious! Best French toast item I've ever had. The huevos rancheros was good but wasn't really a breakfast item even though it was listed under breakfast entrees. The waitress was friendly and down to earth. Nice, homey atmosphere overall. Not crazy about their coffee or orange juice. If you could overlook their drink options, the food is very good. The only other complaint I have is to make the menu a little more breakfast friendly on the weekend mornings. Worth a repeat visit though!"}
{"text":"Very good.  Place packed on Sunday at 10AM. They handled crowd well.  Free hot coffee. Service was excellent.  Great breakfast option.  Manager stopped  at every table to check on you."}
{"text":"I was out shopping and starving. Had a crazy craving for corn beef hash. So Yelp to the rescue. Metro Diner came up and was near by.   I loved the spot. It took over one of my fav past restaurant space. I walked and was greeted and seated quickly. I order the protein plate which at the time I was working out and dieting. I was not prepared for the plate. So much food and it was so good. It was so much food I had to take some home and had my wife jealous.  They have beverage bar where you can go and get coffee and tea. The set up is nice and easy to move around. Love them and will be going back with friends."}
{"text":"Newer place to try. Thoroughly enjoyed both visits here. Tried breakfast was delicious so few days later tried lunch, equally great. Portions oversized for most appetites. Reasonable priced, customer service was great both times, they aim to please. Check out the weekly specials, yum yum. If you like good comfort foods a must try, but if you like salads they do have a good choice selection of that too."}
{"text":"What a neighborhood joint!.  Ate breakfast there on Thanksgiving morning.  First were greeted by several waiters and waitresses.   Made us feel at home.  Put our orders in and within 5-10 minutes, plateful of food was on our table.   I had scramble eggs, hash browns and brown toasts.  The portions were bang on.   Other had pancake (humongous 10\").  Special daily coffee with pumpkin spice was grateful.  Bill came in at surprisingly very fair.    Will definitely return again the next time."}
{"text":"We had been a couple of times and had good food and good experience. The last time we went my hash browns were barely cooked almost raw so I sent them back. I guess this guy was a manager and slammed my plate down and told me I should have asked for them scattered he was yelling at me!!!!!! pointing his finger It was my fault they were not cooked!!!!! we got our bill and left the food!!!!! I will never go back to the one on Rainbow!!!! we go to the one on Serene where I do not get yelled at or corrected. The one on Serene are well mannered and friendly great food and service."}
{"text":"I really like the feel of this diner. I've only been twice, and their food has been great both times, but honestly I wish they had more options on the menu (especially for breakfast). I wish they had skillets and breakfast burritos! Also too, they are pretty pricey, but you do get pretty good portions."}
{"text":"Sometimes the service is good, sometimes not so much. The food is more upscale diner food and the price reflects the more upscale part. I have always been satisfied with the food, but service being hit or miss gets 4 stars."}
{"text":"The fried chicken and waffle is really good. The portion is huge. The chicken is crispy. The waffles are ok. Their regular coffee is excellent. The service is great."}
{"text":"let me say Woooowwww and Ooommmmggggg this place will take over and spread like wild fire once word gets out the yo hola made me wanna slap someone literally food is so addictive here.....i wouldnt mind spending $100 a week here because thats what im going to do hahaha....man this place is great im spechless my mouth want stope watering...."}
{"text":"It's Thanksgiving but with kids out of town I decided not to cook. Thought my husband and I could find a restaurant to have our turkey dinner this year. Went to Cracker Barrel but it was a 2 hour wait. Went to another restaurant in Matthews but they wanted a little too much for a 3 course lunch of turkey. Finally ended up at Metro and was seated right away and ordered the special; waffle made out of stuffing topped with mashed potatoes, turkey and gravy. It was very good; the only thing missing was the green bean casserole. A lot of food and then the dessert (which we had to get to go) came  with the meal for free. Great deal and it was reasonably priced and didn't have to wait all day. Thanks Metro. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered Belgian waffles and the chicken and biscuit sandwich. Both were good. I wanted to try these all but yes it was a bit filling and I didn't finish. I asked for the waffle to be a little crispy because I like a little crunch in it and they made it perfect! Served with butter and syrup. You can ask for a side of strawberry butter to put on top if you wanna try. If you do, it's a very sweet combo with the syrup FYI...the chicken biscuit sandwich was good too. I asked for a side of their spicy sauce instead of them pouring it over the chicken cuz I was afraid the biscuit would get soggy. Overall it was all good."}
{"text":"The service was kind of slow but hey i was able to talk to my brother a little longer. It took about an 1hour to get our food, but hey for a couple it took 1 waffle and a half a chicken and yes that was alot of food, and i would definitly go back there again. If your in Vegas please go get you a plate of them waffles."}
{"text":"Great service! Fast and friendly... breakfast was excellent!if you don't want to wait for a table don't go on Sunday for brunch... But if you do it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great Food and Great Service. Awesome yelp find and off the strip and away from Vegas. If your in the area check them out. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Well that was an experience....and not the kind I want to repeat. After waiting about an hour to be seated, we then waited another 40 minutes with about 50-100 other restaurant patrons who also had no food for our food to come out. I can put up with a lot in the pursuit of a good hungover Sunday breakfast; however, after being told that there were three managers working in the kitchen and not one of us got the right order, I was a bit confused to say the least. One of us had eggs that definitely had just come right out of a chicken in the kitchen. Another one of us got eggs that got extra cooked to make up for the lack of cooking in the other eggs. My potatoes were definitely chopped and plated raw. My fianc√©e got a wrap with sour cream...we're vegan. And my other friend got everything that she asked for to not be in her food in it. Were we comped for any of this? Nah. Like I said, it was an experience."}
{"text":"If you're looking for mashed potatoes and meatloaf or a chicken pot pie then this is the place for you. It's nothing fancy but the food is good and the staff friendly. The chicken and waffles is a whole chicken not wings so be warned.  If you can't get in go over to Hawthornes for pizza."}
{"text":"Today, the hubby and I, wanted to try a new place for our lunch.  Metro Diner is the perfect place for a nice leisurely lunch.   Upon arrival, we were greeted by a friendly hostess.  Our waiter was friendly and helpful with information on the different menu offerings.  The specials are listed in a prominently displayed blackboard.  The food was tasty.  I had a turkey wrap and my hubby had a BBQ bacon burger. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have to give this restaurant 5 stars.  I have been to the Metro Diner several times. Excellent service every time.  Your greeted before you even walk into the door.  The waiter/waitress is knowledgeable about the food,makes recommendations, checks on you during your meal.  The food is cooked just the way you want and it's served hot.  I've enjoyed the food i've eatten here and i'm sure you will too.  The Metro Diner is tops in customer Service."}
{"text":"The customer service was great, the food was amazing. This will be one restaurant that I frequent from now on. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to try first, I will have to come back many times and try many more items. I saw a few people with negative reviews about the friendliness of the waiters and waitresses, this was not something I noticed from the waitstaff."}
{"text":"I am loving this place. I've been there twice and so far they have not disappointed. They have a different twist on their huevos rancheros, they are a must try! Great service too!"}
{"text":"I went their for the soft opening I had the sani Benedict witch was very good  are server was very friendly . i will be deafly be coming back in the near further ."}
{"text":"the second metro diner I been to and it is as awesome as the other one . i had the Sandi Benedict witch was so good . The waitress was very friendly as well"}
{"text":"Only been here twice and each experience was great. Food and service never disappoint. Your food comes out quick and people are always so friendly. If you're looking for a nice diner with great quality food then go to Metro!"}
{"text":"Metro Cafe is one of those places that has the best of what we all look for in a restaurant - great service and great food.  Their menu options aren't too big, which is a good thing, and the ones that they do provide have unique twists.  Everyone comes here for their fried chicken--I know that I do--but take a chance on their burgers and sandwiches.  You won't regret it.  Hot, fresh, and made from scratch makes this diner a go-to for comfort food cravings.  Trust me--you'll put this place on your top 5 comfort food eats."}
{"text":"This place has great food, but the past 2 times I've eaten here, I've had an issue. The first time I found a gnat in my drink. The second time there was hair in my husbands steak. Both times I was generously compensated by the manager on duty, but it was still a huge inconvenience. Food is good, but sanitation could be better."}
{"text":"This diner is fantastic we were from out of town and heard about the food here and had to try it out.  We were there on Sunday 3/25/17 and we had a party of 4 and had to wait 30 minutes, which wasn't bad.  We got the chicken and waffles and breakfast pie, and the other couple got shrimp and grits and chicken and waffles.  All of the dishes were excellent.  The service was fantastic we had Alexis and she was wonderful... I would recommend this place over and over again. ."}
{"text":"Decided to pop in today and I'm happy we did. Food was better than expected. Service was great and fast. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Soon as you walk in you are greeted by a friendly host. I love the ambience here and how the kitchen is very open.  Hubby and I got their corn beef hash. I asked for toast instead of pancakes but got charged separately for a pancake (it's okay service and food was so good it wasn't too big a deal). Service was 5/5 and food was 5/5. The manager here is extremely professional and kind. If we're ever back in Vegas, we will definitely be back. Oh and their hazelnut coffee is yum! No pictures cause we were so hungry and the food was so good we couldn't stop eating lol. Great diner!"}
{"text":"Nothing short of five stars for service and food for this long awaited diner. Two friends and I had breakfast/lunch here today and can't rave  enough about both the food and the service. Janice had a southern omelette that comes  with toast and a bowl of melon and strawberries. Colleen had crispy bacon,  eggs and fresh hashbrowns that were absolute perfection. I opted for the meatloaf dinner that comes with mashed potatoes and grilled zucchini. The meatloaf,  along with the fried chicken and waffles are their most requested dinners and I can see why. Everyone of us absolutely loved the food....fresh, hot and perfectly done.  The only downside: the coffee could be a little richer with a little more body, but that's how we saw it.  The service is professionally served by people who know what they're doing.Be sure  to ask for Leah or Darlene, both outstanding servers.  If you haven't been here yet,  be sure to try METRO DINER. The restaurant was crowded on Sunday as it should be; an indication that they're doing something right."}
{"text":"Hardy comfort food with big portions, and super friendly staff! It's hard not to give them 5 stars just based on how nice they were buttt...  Wasnt a fan of fish and chips ( fish in fried chicken breading) and sogy. Manger totally willing to make me something else, which is so nice, but I shared my companions food instead so he took the fish and chips off the bill. So nice he didn't need to do that, but I appreciate him making it right.  My companion and I shared The Pittsburg, totally big enough for us to share. Basically a roast beef sandwich which they put :coleslaw, tomatoe, cheese, fries, and a fried egg. was a little dry maybe ask for a side of mayo or sause for it.  We also had a side of Mac and cheese totally satisfying.  Deffinantly wanna try out there breakfast"}
{"text":"The food here is average/decent, portions are generous, prices reasonable. Almost always busy, and waiters are relatively prompt and friendly. Good place to meet a friend or associate for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"I love the ambience of this place. Not sure how to spell her name but Finn is an excellent waitress!! Very homey and welcoming feeling!!! I had the daily special called Oscar omelette with crab meat (the real crab) not the imitation,asparagus,egg white and I can't remember what sauce but it is yummy to my tummy"}
{"text":"First visit, very impressed!  My grilled vegetables were a delight.  Not mush, not boiled and bland but, delicately seasoned, fresh and cooked just right.  Any diner that does must care I thought.  The meatloaf was good and gravy just right, not too heavy.  I think meatloaf is their most popular item.  The prices were good, service was very good and I left wondering how they do it.  Nice dining room with good window light and plenty of easy parking.  Bathrooms we're clean.  The manager came by twice to ask if everything was ok. Like wow!  They've got spirit!"}
{"text":"We tried this place out tonight. The fried chicken and macaroni and cheese was good. The service was excellent. Kellie was our server. Good job"}
{"text":"Although I gave this restaurant five stars, there is one issue I sometimes have here.  It takes me a long time to decide what I want because everything is amazing here.  The food is very inventive and well cooked.  I was told that they don't have a microwave since they insist all the food is cooked completely fresh.  The staff is incredible and treats me as if I were a family member every time I come in.   Since this location opened I don't think I have been to another restaurant.  Food is very reasonably priced and always top notch."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, we came here for a late breakfast and was seated right away. The Beni's were delicious as the omelets! They were more than willing to make changes to our order to adjust for dietary changes and great service. (Good WiFi too!)"}
{"text":"This place has great customer service but the food is concerning.  I'm here with family right now and our nephew ordered a mushroom Swiss burger which came with a strawberry and a raisin between the buns.  Why would you put fruit in a burger?  Also, My fries came with bits of fatty fried chicken, is this on purpose?  I ordered the grilled cheese with a side of fries.  It's always concerning when you don't know how foreign foods end up in your food.  Maybe the cooks need more training?  I would've rated one star but the service was good, our group of seven is probably not coming back."}
{"text":"Yum! I have been to the location on the west side and loved it. Came here with friends around 12:00. We all ordered and agreed to share. I'm going to start with the first by favorite, the Chicken and waffles with the strawberry butter it's so amazing! They mix the syrup with hot sauce in a bowl next to you and that was amazing! Next was the special of the day the country style eggs Benedict with biscuits And gravy. Melt in your mouth so good! Next we had the Cobb salad with the honey mustard, the dressing was really good and the chicken was super tasty and crispy. Last we ended it with the Shrimp and grits platter, which wasn't my favorite but that's because I'm not a grits fan, the sauce was good that covered the shrimp. Food was delicious and I definitley can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Okay, y'all please don't sleep on Metro. Trust me as a loyal Las Vegan, I love me the B-Hill but this place blew my taste buds away. I'm so glad that my friend wanted me to try this place! So that's what we did today after work we headed down to the lovely Metro Diner,beautiful place inside and out. Very clean, very shiny and most of all very cozy! Our server Ricky was amazing. He was warm and polite with just enough personality to take the cake for one of the best servers I have had the joy of dining with. He explained everything on the menu and suggested great choices. He wasn't lying when he said the creators of Metro Diners men√∫ know what they're doing with food. We started off with the flavored tea of the day which was Mango. Unsweetened it was already so good,lots of flavor. He suggested the special of the day which was the chicken quesadilla ! Omg the quesadillas flavors was something I had never tasted. Secret ingredient was olives! I know, what the heck are they doing in a quesadilla but I have to say it was a 10! Unfortunately not something on the regular menu but so glad to have tried it, ask and I'm sure they would be glad to make it. Another thing I really wanted to try was the Spicy honey chicken biscuit. Living in Texas for 3 years really made me appreciate a good chicken biscuit. This sandwich was the hands down best! When you take a bite the flavor of the honey and the spice overwhelms your mouth with how great it is, and no im not over exaggerating. I ordered that with a side of mac and cheese and gravy. DIP the biscuit in the GRAVY! You will not be disappointed. Ugh this place is so good I'm mad I didnt have room for dessert. Ricky had no problem getting my friend to take a banana cheesecake to go. He described it not as a cheesecake but more on the cake side. Im ranting now, but you get the jist. Metro Diner im coming back for you!"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time. And we were greeted. I love the homey, warm feeling from the staff. Damn it! I forgot the name of our server. Lol. I love how cozy it is in there. I love the food. It's a good portion. My husband and I ordered philly cheesesteak and reuben sandwhich to go. But for dine in. I had the bold burger? I love the crunchy jalapeno.the dish is common to most restaurant. What defies it is the taste. Which metro defied all the odds. For me. That is. Lol. My husband got the salisbury steak. And he said. \"Amdfkmdmmmmmmm....mmmm... mmmmm... yum!\" Lol. Anyways. We'll come back next time my husband is off."}
{"text":"Another mediocre diner.  We were greeted at the front door very loudly, after being seated we were constantly barraged with wait staff asking if we were okay.  We ordered basic burgers with fries and I had the soup.  The food was not bad.  It was not good enough to ask for a go bag.  This seems like a common theme for a restaurant and if you are going to enter this arena you need something that will set you apart.  If it was here we didn't notice it."}
{"text":"I'm actually really sad because I wanted to like this place more than I did. Let me start off by saying the ambiance of this place is amazing and so was the service. Our waiter was extremely kind & he is not the reason I'm rating this place so low. The reason for my 2 star rating is because the food really just was not anything special. I paid $11+ for some mediocre pancakes that I found to be extremely dry, hash browns, sausage and eggs. For breakfast food such as this, that is way overpriced. My friend paid $12+ for corn beef hash. That is just insanity when \"egg works\" right down the road is like half the price and higher quality food. All of my friends love this diner & I can see that they love it because of the impeccable service but the food really just was not anything special at all.... Probably will not return here."}
{"text":"This place tastes great! Decent sized portions and the servers have great personalities and deliver wonderful service! The only thing I didn't care for, our server was busy explaining things on the menu. Our food was sitting in the window. Everyone is busy running around, but there's the manager just standing there leaning against the little wall. When our server is freed up from helping the guest, he goes to get our food. The manager has the balls to lecture the server about letting food sit in the window! Why couldn't the manager do some work? Or was he really needed to hold the wall? It was also unprofessional the smart comments the manager made to the server afterwards. Even with the manager leaving our food in the window, the food was great!"}
{"text":"I'm happy to have this new restaurant in town!  I've only been once and because it's new, I think there are still some kinks to work out, so I'll update my review and hopefully add that fifth star after my next visit.   Our server, Adrienne, was full of personality and made sure our drinks and food hit the table in a timely manner.  She suggested the shrimp and grits....good choice.  I'm picky about my grits, and these were quite delicious.  Hubs had the eggs benedict and he enjoyed his food, too.  We will definitely return and I'll ask for Adrienne's station because she was funny and was really hustling to keep her tables happy."}
{"text":"Food and service is awesome!  Chicken and waffles are among the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Quiet environment open in spaceships you got to see the workers and the cook do the cooking over the counter the prices were ridiculous but the portion of food is a lot they literally have everything here and the coffee was great.  Customer service was cool consistent patient we even had another gentleman who I think is the manager came over asked if we where enjoying our food my mom said yes so fast lol it was my aunt who didn't like her eggs so she suggested for her food to be done over that went great. Lol smh   Anywho if I lived out here I would most diff be back, and I'll give the beef stew a try it looks so yum yum"}
{"text":"Service and food were great! I had the Chicken and Waffles. The waffle was just okay... but the chicken is what will bring me back! It was juicy and so flavorful! The sauce they make table side (maple syrup and Louisiana hot sauce) was yummy! I was a little disappointed with my beverage options. I prefer flavored creamer with my coffee and many breakfast shops offer this amenity. I was hoping my juice was freshly squeezed... and it was lack luster and not good.  I'll probably come back...the menu items looked good."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today.  Service was excellent.  Chicken and waffles were great.  Buddy got chicken pot pie and loved it.  Portions are large. Would totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm visiting family and have come here twice. I had the San Francisco Benedict the first time. It was amazing. The hazelnut and French vanilla coffee are both nice. My friend had the chicken and waffles and she loved it. That was recommended by a friend. I tasted the pancakes that came with one of the meals and they were very good. For lunch today, I got the French dip. It was alright. I wouldn't order it again. My friends got the monte Cristo and the meatloaf that was featured on diners, drive-ins, and dives. I tasted it. Pretty good, but not amazing. They loved the monte cristo. It is a deep fried sandwich with powdered sugar and preserves to dip in. The service was o.k. Both times, but I'm from the land of customer service (Orlando) so, I'm used to amazing service. Maybe it's considered good for this area. Anyway, I would come back. The missing star is probably for the lackadaisical service. They're friendly enough, but just not quite as attentive as I'm used to. They still got over 20%, so it wasn't terrible. I would go back. Especially for the coffee and Benedict."}
{"text":"Have heard many friends talk about this place, so Terri and I went and checked it out. GREAT food and service. Loved the beverage bar. I had the River City hash. Delicious!! Potatoes with 2 eggs any style, ham onions peppers, and Hollandaise sauce. Terri had the Strawberry Crepes. Equally good. The food was piping hot. Lamont was our server and did a great job. We'll be regulars!"}
{"text":"Usually a great place my boyfriend love to go but, today we came in to a not so busy resturant but little customer service, unusal to what we are use to. The food not being much better. My boyfriend order fish and chips with the fish being under seasoned and the breading around it wasn't much better. I ordered the chicken tenders with ranch. Of course I love their ranch usually but, when I asked for a second one I felt like an inconvience to my server and after finishing up the last bites of my food I was extremely disappointed to find a short black hair at the bottom of my ranch container. WOW. I WONT be coming back sadly."}
{"text":"First time here at Metro Diner. Our waiter was Awesome Javier. He was very friendly, helpful and efficient! We need more people like him serving!  He recommended the favorites. We ordered the chicken and waffle, meatloaf, country fried steak and broccoli cheese soup. They were all delicious! Fried chicken wasn't crispy though but went well with the syrup and hot sauce dip. Country fried steak wasn't crispy but good. Maybe the oil temperature needs to be a bit higher...?"}
{"text":"Metro diner probably has my favorite chicken and waffles that I've had! The chicken and waffles are a good portion size and you should definitely share them if you can. You get half a chicken so there is plenty to go around. The best part is the strawberry butter that they have, it makes the waffle ten times better. The chicken is crunchy and flavorful and the waffle is very light. I've had other dishes here, but none have come close to the chicken waffles."}
{"text":"My breakfast was so yummy customer service was excellent and food didn't take too long was just the right time with the diner being super busy and full I would recommend anyone here for breakfast"}
{"text":"I'm being generous with three stars and as I typed this I'm not sure why. Sooo demerits! 2 stars it is. I had the biscuits and gravy and the chicken biscuit. The food was just ok. The chicken was tasty however.   The service is what gives this place a 2. I was told to sit wherever I want but there was nothing but dirty tables available. When I asked someone to clear the table I seemed to annoy them. I ordered coffee and while the waitress and I discussed refills, she decided I meant I wanted my 2nd cup of coffee with my check. I asked for napkins never happened. Not a one. I've also been staring at my to go order for 15 mins. I tipped 20% but I'm kicking myself for that as there was zero service. I'm Legit NEVER coming back here."}
{"text":"All I have to say is delicious!!! The food was amazing from presentation to flavors. I tried the San Francisco Benedict - perfectly flavored with avocado and tomato and hash browns to die for. Add a side of biscuit and gravy not to mention a perfect waffle with chocolate chips and butter. They also serve the syrup Warm! A great touch."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Cali and our local friends brought us here for breakfast. What a great place. Our waitress, Jaci was fantastic as was the rest of the staff! A+ thank you Jaci!"}
{"text":"A pleasant place.  Tables were not to crowded together so you could visit easily.  Lots of booths for those who like them.  Laid back vibe from people who work there. Food was good and portions were plentiful for the price.  My only issue is with the music played.  First off it was louder than it needed to be and what 'diner'  plays heavy metal music/punk rock!  It just didn't fit for the theme or the clientele present."}
{"text":"I usually love your fried chicken. And anything else I usually order as well. But Thursday night it was so salty it was pretty much inedible. I'm never one to send food back but if I hadn't gotten it to go I definitely would've sent it back for something else.  That's $15.49 of a meal that I couldn't eat. I thought last time it was a little salty too. But this time it was extremely salty and not just the crust but the meat too so I couldn't even peel off the skin to eat the meat. Also my 2 orders of hash browns weren't crunchy either. I really like metro diner but they seem to be going a little downhill from what I've heard from a few people. I really wish they'd get their crap together because we need you in Charlotte. I also wish they were open at least an hour later every night."}
{"text":"This place really surprised me. The service is great and the food is really good! The chicken and waffles with the strawberry butter was delicious. Great stuff!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. I'm from back east and dinner/comfort food is what I'm all about. They do it right here. The serving portions are HUGE I have never finished a full meal here yet and I had breakfast lunch and dinner. The service is also excellent!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. The service and the food was amazing. Wish I remembered my waitress' name. But everything was great"}
{"text":"We saw them featured on the news this morning. The biscuits and gravy reeled the other half in! This 30 minute trip was worth everything. The service is just as good as the food!"}
{"text":"Tried Metro again, several weeks after opening and I'm still so very impressed. The 'newness' hasn't seemed to wear off of the employees -- they are all really good folks and the service is as good as anywhere else. So far I've had - the meatloaf plate, chicken pot pie (with 2 slice of cheese melted on top), the fried chicken plate, Big Bern's Pork Tenderloin sandwich, Philly Cheese Steak and a breakfast of corned beef hash and eggs. Some of these I've ordered more than once. All of the lunch items have been outstanding. The price isn't cheap but neither is the food. In this case you truly get what you pay for. I've been to both the Rainbow location and the Tropicana and can't wait until the Henderson location opens this month across from the DMV (there are a bit over 100 employees at that DMV that are chomping at the bit to walk across the street!). A truly wonderful place, a terrific team of servers and support workers and gracious management. I can't wait to try the Monte Cristo, pot roast, fish chips - and the burgers I've seen look amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing place. I just reviewed the new location on Rainbow and Warm Springs -- so you can see that. This place - the first in Las Vegas - is a carbon copy. GREAT food and incredible staff all the way down - and up - the line. HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in this evening for dinner.  I was looking for a place sorta like IHOP or Denny's. This diner sounded perfect.  There was no wait time to be seated. The staff was pleasant, friendly and helpful.  Food was good and portions were large enough that we each ended up taking part of our dinners home for later.  I had the meatloaf plate and she had the pot roast. We both had a dinner salad.  Total with tip was about $45. A little pricier then a Denny's or IHOP but then service was definitely better."}
{"text":"Comfort food menu-very hard to find something healthy. I just started a new diet and was limited to a salad or grilled chicken and squash.  We went on a week night around 6 and this place was packed! We were told there was a 30-45 minute wait. Lots of people already waiting outside... We were offered the bar for immediate seating so that's what we chose.   The restaurant was loud. Especially sitting at the bar since the staff yell back and forth at each other. It was fun to watch them cook however.   I got a salad with grilled chicken. Nothing special. All of their salads were typical everyday salads....nothing to return for.   My mom got the roast-she said it was very good. Fell apart with a fork. However it was supposed to come with veggies and it looked like she got the bottom of the container.   My dad got the chicken pot pie-looked good. He said it was tasty but the biscuit topping was tough.   Overall we might come back but not our new go to spot.   Wait staff was nice. Looked a little frantic-maybe they are still getting the swing of things?"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we'll definitely be back everything was great! Food and service and may i add that the chicken and waffles is a must try"}
{"text":"My wife has hashimotos thyroiditis along with borderline celiac disease, which means that she cannot consume any gluten, grains if any type, dairy, or nightshades. Needless to say going out to eat can be very challenging but there are options as long as the kitchen and wait staff is corporative. When we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess. My wife asked for a gluten-free menu to start. The menu said they used gluten-free buns, but my wife also can't have any grains including rice flour whichch is a common ingredient in some gluten-free breads. She asked the hostess if she could ask the kitchen what ingredients are in the bread. We watched as the cook in the kitchen yelled at the hostess saying that \"nobody's ever complained about our gluten free bread before so I'm sure the lady (my wife) will be just fine!\" That's when the hostess embarrassingly repeated what the cook told her. My wife then heard the cook yelling at her for the whole restaurant to hear, hat she shouldn't have any troubles with the bread. My wife then tried to gently explain that she needed to know the ingredients because she has to be sure that there are not other allergens in the bread as well because she had more than just a gluten allergy. The cook then loudly yelled at my wife in front of everybody which was humiliating! The other patrons were shocked that this cook was doing this. We left immediately because I knew that if I stayed any longer I was going to beat the s*** out of that guy in front of everyone. It took everything I had to not go back to teach that guy a lesson. I called the manager and told her what happened and she said that she heard about it already. She said she was going to do something about it but I know she didn't because I recently heard from a friend who said that same guy is still working in the kitchen.   Needless to say, I will NEVER go back there again. There are other choices who have employees who are at least a little sympathetic towards those with food allergies. I understand that perhaps the cook was having a bad day, but that doesn't give him the right to yell at someone just because he made a bad career choice."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service! Our server was very nice and helpful.  They didn't have chicken fried steak on the menu but our server let us order it anyway, I ended up getting the chicken and waffles. Both dishes were very good. I liked how our server told me how to mix the syrup and hot sauce perfect combo."}
{"text":"First time here loved it! The service is great, out server was John A. He was extremely sweet, informative and gave us such a great overall service. The food is beyond delicious, I got the chicken and waffles....man that was good! It's been hard to find good chicken and waffles here in Las Vegas all the places we have tried we don't like it but this place is the best. My honey got the egg benedict and he loved it but mainly loved my plate. Also the portions of their food is great , you leave with a full tummy.  New favorite spot for breakfast, definatley loved this place."}
{"text":"Exceptional customer experience!  However, not recommended for vegetarians. One option was available beside Salad."}
{"text":"I have been to this joint twice and the one on S. Rainbow at least twice.  On all occasions it was at the urging of my friends because they saw the Triple D's episode that featured the Metro Diner.  The 2 stars rating has nothing to do with the services at both locations which were very good.  It is the food that my friends and I found to be average or less than average.  The fried chicken was average but salty with a dry and boring waffle.  At another diner I ate at, the waffle was tasty even without the syrup.  At this Serene diner, the corned beef hash I ate was dry and crumbly like salted saw dust.  I guess the poached eggs were supposed to add the moisture the beef hash needed.  This past Mother's Day, my companion insisted on dining at the Serene diner because Guy Fieri  cannot be wrong.  The service was very good and the joint was jam packed with customers.  I didn't mind the crowd or that the food was slow coming out of the kitchen.  I decided to try the Hot Turkey Plate and it was boring.  How can you mess up a simple dish?  The turkey and gravy were very salty.  The gravy looked and tasted like it was spooned off the top of a steam table gravy pot.  The baguette was dry like an old dinner roll.  My companion did not finish her waffle and withheld her assessment of what she ate.  I think she did not want to admit Mr. Fieri is not flawless in his restaurant reviews.  There are better diners in the nearby neighborhood and I am going to be firm with my friends, no more Metro Diner for me."}
{"text":"Wen't and took my Mom as a treat for being my mom.. Sunday at 1 pm and the place was packed, we didn't have to wait too long before we were seated, and luckily we got a booth. I ordered the meatloaf which comes with mashed potatoes and gravy, and a side of grilled veggies (really good!). I couldn't believe my mom just ordered a Belgium waffle, she has been begging me to take her here for weeks, and now that they are open she orders something I can make at home. She said it was really good, she said the meatloaf was good, but she can make better... haha that's my mom for ya. She got a peach cobbler to go and said it would take a week to finish it, she polished that sucker off in two days.  The pricing is bit high but the food is really good."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Homemade fried chicken was superb. Friendly staff and great service. WE WILL BE BACK"}
{"text":"Food is always good here! Lately the service has not been the best - waitress rarely came to refill drinks & bring the check; had to tell another waitress our order at least 5 times before she could get it right. Luckily the food is good & the managers are great."}
{"text":"I ordered the 3 egg breakfast a fruity waffle and \"cheesiest\" grits. I mean it's breakfast which is hard to get wrong. The grits were not good at all they just put cheese on top which isn't how you make cheese grits taste good. I didn't eat them. My waffle was good. The waste staff were very polite and efficient. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"This place is seriously soooo good! Highly recommend the croissant french toast and chicken fingers! You can tell everything here is homemade."}
{"text":"Great food but it can sometimes take a while to come out to the table. We've had mixed experiences with this. My biggest complaint is that the restrooms do not have a sanitary location to change diapers. They do not have changing tables in either restroom and so you are forced to use the floor or the counter next to the sink. When I mentioned this to the manager, it was suggested that I use a row of extra chairs in the hallway like other parents. He let me know they don't have changing tables based on limited space available in the handicap stalls and ADA requirements for space. We've been back multiple times and they still do not have a solution in place for this. For a restaurant that caters to kids, this is a big gap that needs to be addressed."}
{"text":"Ordered corned beef hash with two poached eggs. The eggs were on a separate dish. Corned beef was crispy but under seasoned.   Wife ordered the breakfast burrito and it was basically an omelette wrapped in a tortilla, again under seasoned.   Not sure what the big draw is here but I was not impressed.   The staff and facility was clean and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!My friend and I went here today for brunch/lunch and was very pleased overall.  Food:A wide variety of choices and more than enough portion sizes.We ordered the Shrimp & Grits which was really good.We also ordered a side of hashbrowns and cornbeef hash.The cornbeef was really unique to me.It consisted of shaved/shredded cornbeef and potatoes.  Service:From the host all the way to the cook behind the counter,the customer service is superb.By name,I interacted with Sherry and Julie and they were both on top of it.What stood out to me the most was that despite how busy the cooks were ALL of them seemed to enjoy their roles.They interacted well together,communicated effectively,and were all patient with one another.I kept telling myself there was no way I could do what they were doing without messing up an order somewhere along the line but they presented to be a cohesive team.  Prices:Appropriately priced for portions and quality of food  Setting:Not that big but big enough for a diner;there is outside seating  There are so many things I want to try on the menu so I'll be back again soon.Thank you Metro Diner for being a great addition to the area!"}
{"text":"Rating it a 3 1/2 , though the service was great and it had a nice atmosphere, but the prices were overpriced, I had the cinnamon rolled pancakes with peacans, and butter cinnamon $10.99 there special for the day, my son had the chicken tenders with French fries $10.99 chicken were greasy tho,, drinks were $2.99 each.  It was okay."}
{"text":"Just had a great lunch here. I had the fried chicken plate- it was crispy and moist, with a nice taste. My friends had the meatloaf and pork loin sandwich and both were happy with their choices. All the staff were friendly and professional. I will definitely return"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Serves full menu all day. Love the self-serve coffee bar and daily specials. We've quickly found ourselves becoming regulars:)"}
{"text":"Found the end of the whip cream can tip in my food... are you serious...... Overpriced restaurant with mediocre food.... I wish I could give less than 1 star."}
{"text":"5 stars for the excellent service, although potpies way way too salty, Tell the cooks to let customers add their own salt.    'Monica' is the best waitress ever.....french fries are very good and real too. Kudos for bringing out all piping hot food to a large group of 11 people at one time....no other restaurant can manage that.  Blueberry hill serves ALL cold food to larger groups...just saying/."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  I've been there twice and will be back.  Reminds me of diner back in New Jersey where I grew up."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The service was friendly and even better fast. I have a 18 month so we were able to be in and out before he threw a tantrum. The food was so good and taste homemade. I definitely would recommend this place to anyone wanting a nice casual meal."}
{"text":"Yum!! Exactly what we expected it would be! True to diner form! Food was great and service was friendly Thanks Ralph, you rock!"}
{"text":"I am such a fan of the Metro Diners! I have been to this location a few times and my good has been perfect on each vist.  I ordered the staple chicken and waffles with the strawberry butter that puts it over the top.The chicken came out crispy and juicy and my coffee never got below half way empty on each vist.  So glad this place is around the corner from where I live!"}
{"text":"So glad I decided to have a diner for lunch today. First off this place is a much-needed relief from the standard heavy breakfast oriented Bland diners that is littered throughout Las Vegas.  You can get breakfast and dinner entrees all day here. I went with the meatloaf plate which came with a nice size portion of mashed potatoes and gravy, and some sliced squash and zucchini that was grilled and of course the meatloaf came with gravy and a slice of a baguette. It was really impressive on how fast they got my order and the food out to me given that it was lunch time and the place was bustling. Service was Top Notch, food was Top Notch and the atmosphere was really buzzing. Just an excellent place to come in for a quick bite on your lunch hour and I will probably be back for breakfast on the weekend when I can have some chicken and waffles and take my time drinking a few cups of coffee."}
{"text":"OMGeeee ... that strawberry butter was everything ... it is a must try ... The hosts was friendly, the server and service was fast, very clean environment with some amazing food ... We will definitely return soon"}
{"text":"Went to this new location Sunday foe brunch bc it's closer to my home.. Well let's just say the location in vegas off Rainbow is way better. I got the iconic chicken and waffles and the chicken  , which is the most solid choice at the Metro Diner in vegas, came out soggy and very lack luster due to it being room temp. I mentioned it to the server who intern told the manager. She took care of the dish but I didn't have time for them to remake it. I'm probably going to give this location one more more shot just bc of the location. I hope it was just a fluke :("}
{"text":"Went there twice and so far everything is stellar. Both times we had John A. as our server. He is super funny and is great at what he does. He and the rest of the staff make us feel at home like we're chillin with family.   The food we've ordered has all been delicious. I've eaten pretty much everything on my plate! My husband loves the food so much he usually orders something to take home. The first time I ordered a Yo Hala with a side of turkey sausage. All I have to say is YUM! The Yo Hala was pretty sweet, but the salt from the sausage balanced it out. My dad and husband got the chicken and waffles with strawberry butter. It comes with a lot of food so if you're hungry you will be satisfied. If you're not that hungry you can either share it with a friend or take home the leftovers. My husband ordered the Holy Davoli sandwich to go. He ate that for his late night dinner.   The second time we went I ordered a chicken pot pie. I loved it because it wasn't too thick or have too much crust like some I've tried before. My dad ordered the meatloaf and husband ordered the chicken & waffles again. My husband sampled the chicken pot pie and like it so much he cleaned the bowl for me (see pictures). lol. He also liked my dad's meatloaf so he ordered a meatloaf sandwich to go. We tried the strawberry cobbler for dessert. It had a hard piece of ice cream on top which melted with the warmth from the cobbler. It was a little sweet, but it went well with the ice cream.   I'd definitely order the same things again, but I want to explore more of the menu. I think we'll be going again today. I wonder what I'll get this time..."}
{"text":"Great diner food with huge portions cooked perfectly! Friendly staff and the manager even came by to check to see how everything was! I haven't had service like this in a while. This is one spot we are coming to from now on when we come to Vegas"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Staff in great mood and takes good care of their customers."}
{"text":"First impression upon entering metro diner is the friendly warm welcome. We were asked to seat ourselves at any table.  It was mid afternoon and there were many tables available. A server promptly arrived and offered us water and provided menus. When the water arrived the menu was was explained along with the special of the day that is listed on the chalk board. The restaurant is nicely decorated and has a choice of booths and tables. There is also an outdoor patio that is shaded in the afternoon.  The menu has a large selection for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Our choices were the Pot Roast and the Shrimp and Grits. Both turned out to be large portions.   The Shrimp and Grits consist of two fried grit cakes infused with cheese, roasted red peppers and Andouille sausage. Topped with shrimp, sausage, onions and peppers in a shrimp sauce. Garnished with chopped bacon and green onions. This rendition is different from the typical southern version but it's a great stick to your ribs meal.  The Pot Roast is a delicious roast slowly cooked, served with veggies, (carrots and onions), mashed potatoes and covered in its own flavorful juices. This is a very hardy meal."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles were great. My daughter ordered a grill cheese with a side of mac & cheese, only suggestion is the servers need to ask if anything other than cheese is wanted in the sandwich. She got a tomato in it. We were very surprised to see the sandwich wasn't charged after she said she didn't like it. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered fried chicken dinner for takeout. It comes with mashed potatoes and gravy (mashed have skin on), a vegetable which was squash and a biscuit. Also ordered a broccoli cheese soup. The biscuit and the gravy on potatoes were good but surprisingly everything else was just borderline okay. Takeout service and packaging was excellent though."}
{"text":"The breakfast was fantastic and the portion sizes were huge!  The wait staff was extremely friendly and caring even when it appeared that they were crazy busy at the time.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My Mother, Sister, and I were around the area and wanted something to eat. We decided to try this place as it is pretty recent in our area and boy was it an amazing choice. You can sit wherever you feel comfortable, and we were immediately approached by our friendly waitress (whom I cannot remember her name sadly) she brought us our drinks and was very polite in explaining to us what is on the menu. Now, although it was 3 in the afternoon, I decided to order pancakes, bacon, and eggs. The food came quick and was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this place if you'd like to come and eat with your family or even alone!"}
{"text":"Wow, I can't say enough about how great my first experience was here! First of all every single employee in there greeted me or smiled at me and also did the same as I was leaving. Second of all, the menu selection is great - standard selection of general diner options (think breakfast and sandwiches and chicken) but the portions are insane! I was blown away by how much food you got for the price. The plate my omelette came on (with 4 pieces of toast and a whopping serving of hash browns) was literally full to the edges. Service was fantastic, the server was very charming and helpful with her recommendations. One thing I want to note, too, is that the food was served very quickly!! We were so, so impressed. My family and I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Gave this place one star because my boyfriend and I went in and ordered food to go last night. First off, the person taking the order didn't write the order down. Now I've been to restaurants where a few don't write orders down but they have pretty good memories and get the order right. This one however didn't and we had no idea u til we got home (15minutes away). He ordered a San Francisco Benny and ended up with the crab cake benny. On top of that, if it's your first time ordering from here, can't tell the difference until u bite into the food because the poached eggs and hollindaise sauce is on top. Well, not wanting to waste it since it was late and they'd close soon anyway, on top of being hungry, he ate it and the whole night he felt like s***. He got up throwing up every couple hours. Pretty bad food poisoning from that benny. I went in the following day to speak to the manager and although he said he could be refunded (I didn't have my bf's card n he was home resting, still feeling sh****), he did not seem apologetic one bit. I was left at the lobby area for a few minutes under the impression that he'd come back and call my bf for the card number so he could refund him. And while I was waiting, the two hostesses didn't ask if I still needed help. It wasn't until one of the servers came by that I said something. Very disappointing experience. Now I don't even trust they'll call and give us a refund. I don't even care about the refund but it's the principle that matters to me."}
{"text":"It didn't start off well. Stood there at the stand waiting to be acknowledged let alone seated. About 3-4 minutes and it sure seemed longer. As I was turning to leave a cook sad hi and if I've been helped.  I ordered the meatloaf plates I was in the mood for some home cooking. I didn't leave hungry. Two large pieces of meatloaf, mash potatoes, and grilled squash. Gravy on top. Meatloaf was a little to soft, mushy, for my taste. My mom made the best.  Will I go back, for sure. Hopefully better service. But the food is good and filling."}
{"text":"If you have never been you need to soon. I first found them in Jacksonville FL, where they got their start. I didn't know they were a chain. Good comfort food at reasonable prices. Well worth your time."}
{"text":"First time here and I will be back! The food was the best, fresh and tasty! Nicole gave us the best service, couldn't have asked for better!!"}
{"text":"We eat breakfast here every Sunday. The food is great, prices are a little high and most of the wait staff are very friendly. One time our order did not have all of its ingredients so the manager comped us and corrected the order."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and was quite impressed. First thing when you walk in, if you have to wait, they have a coffee bar so you can have a cuppa while u wait. After yiu get a seat the menu is pretty extensive nd covered all the bases. We got our normal biscuits and gravy app to test the wters and was delighted to get crispy biscuits with soft centers and yummy gravy.  Next was our meals, the breakfast pie with cheese grits . The pie had such great flavor, the cheese mixture was awesome. The grits were cooked perfectly. I got the corned beef hash and I was so happy. The hash was real slow cooked corned beef that was very on point. Along with crispy potatos (like I asked) and perfectly cooked poached eggs. The sourdough bread ws lso on point. The staff was inviting and friendly and there was plenty of coverage for  busy morning. We even chatted with an owner and was delighted to hear the back story of the new place. We will return again Esp to try the chicken and waffles and shrimp and grits :)"}
{"text":"Was too lazy to make breakfast so me and the wife looked for a place to just go and eat. Found this place in yelp and tried it out. Everyone was sooooooo nice and accommodating. Our server Disney was great she introduced us to the maple syrup+hot sauce which was perfect for my chicken and waffles ( best I ever had by the way)."}
{"text":"Ordered the crab Benedict. Where do I start there was one drop of hollandeise sauce on it. The crab  looked like tuna Dark brown. Never in my life have I seen brown crab. The hollandeise sauce was dripping in oil.Tasted like the butter you get at the movies that had been sitting for days. The hash browns well they tasted like somebody poured entire bottle of salt on them. That I couldn't even try to eat. I would recommend never going to this establishment.  My friend had chicken pot pie. She said the reviews on here for it was good. After the 2nd bite I asked her to rate it. She said she gave it a 2. It had no sauce in it and looked like they put a can of mixed vegetables in the bottom of the dish. It had 3 very small chewy pieces of chicken in it..  Again do not eat at this place."}
{"text":"It used to be my favorite place to hang out but just lately I got the chicken salad which I love so much and it fell All over my plate with the chicken and grapes . It did not gave that much mayo holding it all together so I don't know if they changed it  Then I wanted a peach cobbler but they fought out an apple instead. I complained and they Grouchy out another bit it was made so quickly it did but have that glazed cinnamon brown sugar mixture on the top just melted drops of brown  sugar. Just not a cobbler but a sugar mixture . I complained again . The manager said don't worry we have taken care of it . I thought that meant they would take care of the check but no I was still charged fir the chicken sandwich and the soup. It's ok I ate it I paid for it and when I wanted to inquire of the manager she was not available . I think Ilk just go to Denny's wheee the Food is consistently the same!  S.Milko"}
{"text":"First time visiting Metro... I ordered the chicken and waffles. My daughter had the philly and fries. The chicken came out a little to crispy for my liking and it includes white meat, which I don't like. The waitress immediately addressed the issue and the manager even came over to correct it. This time around, it was PERFECT!!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and I will definitely go back. My food was fine. I had an omelette but would not go for that again. My daughter had chicken and waffles and swore that it was the best ever. Her friend had chicken tenders and Mac and cheese and cleaned her plate completely. I'm looking forward to the Huntersville location that will open soon as this independence location is not convenient for me. The staff was very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Diner food at its best! Welcome to Henderson - we love you!  Have not had a bad meal yet."}
{"text":"Try the peach cobbler!!! That shit is the best ever!! I ordered the meat loaf. It was tasty. Just small serving. But everything else was delicious!!! Go there"}
{"text":"Really good new place in Matthews.  Food was great & service was outstanding.  Cant believe what they did with the building.  Very light & airy.  We had the meatloaf & fish & chips. Saut√©ed veggies were wonderful & haven't had mashed potatoes this good in years.  Fish was crispy & hot. Very large portions   We have been 3 times. Once for breakfast, once lunch& once dinner.  The food was great each time.  Our Grandson was with us the 3rd time & he couldn't finish the food.  I have never seen this before.  Portions are huge. My favorite breakfast item is Johns sandwich.  Service is great& servers are always very friendly & checking in often.  Metro will be one of our go to places.  So many things we want to try on the menu."}
{"text":"We've been to this location multiple times and find the service wonderful. They are very friendly and when our order was delayed, the manager comped the meal, even though we were fine with the slight delay.  The food is even better. The crab cake Benedict was excellent, as well as the fried fish. The chicken and waffles are delicious.  The portions are large, so be prepared to have leftovers. I haven't tried their desserts, but bet they are good, as well.  They have great comfort food! My family and I highly recommend the Metro Diner and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Our first visit and wont be our last!  Stopped after work for dinner and brought our appetites.  My husband enjoyed his fish and chips plate and I loved my 3-grilled cheese and fries!  Leah, our server could not have been any nicer!  She was not only attentive but very pleasant and fun to chat with--and it was obvious that she takes pride in her work and making customers happy!   They have a lot of great menu selections and serve breakfast all day so anything on the menu is served at any time during the day.  Missing diners from the Northeast, its nice to see diners out west which are rare!  So glad we gave Metro Diner a try!"}
{"text":"Great chicken and waffles with strawberry butter. I always say I'm going to get something else, but I can't help myself. The service here is excellent and friendly."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous place to eat...the food was outstanding and the staff provided great service! We had a table of 10 and everyone loved their meal! We will be going back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Metro diner sat  down waitress asked what would you like to drink .  To bad  the drinks never came .  we walked out 15 minutes later what a waste of my time ."}
{"text":"I had such a great experience here. 5 stars for customer service. Food was delicious. I got the chicken and waffles and the chicken was cooked perfectly. Juicy and tender meat with a crispy skin. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here during my lunch break (it was a full house) and we just had to wait a couple of minutes for them to finish wiping a booth down.  The service, overall, was decent. Our server was friendly. I was waiting a little bit for the check (since we did have a time limit).  I ordered the two eggs breakfast which came with the eggs, toast, bacon, and I got cheese grits. It came out hot, and the bread was pretty buttered. The grits are not that bad, but I definitely have had better. The bacon was cooked a bit too crispy for my liking, but it was still good. And more than enough to fill me up!  I will most likely be back here because it does have a homey feeling for me.   P.S. the sweet tea is soooo good!!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here at Metro. Andy was our waiter, he had great energy and was super knowledgeable about the menu. Had the Philly cheese steak which was pretty darn good. Wifey had the fried chicken salad which was topped with juicy chicken. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Surprised at how good the food is here.  We have had the chicken pot pie, monte christo sandwich and various salads.  The wait staff is very attentive.  I think it's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Our 2nd visit and NOT our last. Everything we've tried has been fabulous. It was a really tough decision tonight.  We are discerning diners and like good food, well prepared and fresh. This place will NOT disappoint. Fish & Chips was literally the best we've had with only one exception in Santa Monica, CA. Their spinach salad is sensational. We NEVER order dessert but the thought of peach cobbler made this a must tonight. Absolutely amazing - fresh, light crust, not overly sweet and the 'a la mode' put it over the top. The service was exceptional. The management staff go out of their way to be sure you're happy. Prices were soooo very reasonable for what they offer. Can't wait to go back for breakfast soon. I've picked out at least 6 things I can't wait to try next time around."}
{"text":"Place looked awesome, and since it just opened they had an abundance of staff (3 hostesses and I believe one sever per table).  Given the overstaffing, the service was great, which is why I gave them two stars... but the food, ugh!  I ordered chicken and waffles, one of their specials.  Strawberry butter was super sweet so I had to ask for regular whipped, then the chicken... OMG was it salty. Not the batter around the outside of the chicken, since that would be expected.  I'm talking about the meat in the chicken with none of the skin or batter.  I don't even know how they managed it.  My husband couldn't even eat it.  They also brought a half chicken (1 breast, 1 wing, 1, drum stick and 1 thigh), and the waffle piled up in 4 quarters... all crammed into a plate that would not have fit the entire waffle if it wasn't cut into quarters.  I had to move most of the chicken onto the plate they brought with the syrup container just to create enough room to cut a piece of the chicken.  My husband ordered the corned beef hash.  It was flavorless... which is hard to do with corned beef.  I think they didn't season the potatoes, so they sucked up all the flavor.  I know it was bad when I asked my husband about next time and he said he was never planning on going back.  He grew up in a third world country, so he would eat anything.  This was a first for sure.  I'm so disappointed, since we are walking distance and were excited about having a nearby breakfast option.   Food just did not live up to the great staff and service."}
{"text":"This place has a cute little diner vibe with a woody feel. You can definitely bring groups and children as well. The menu caters to breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert!  My table all ordered lunch menu items and everything we ordered was pretty good including our macaroni sides.    We also ordered the bananas fosters cheesecake and that was a really good cheesecake. I mean REALLY good.   The service was really great and friendly. It wasn't fancy or extravagant but for what it was it was good."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy!!!  Service, both times we went, was outstanding! We had Salisbury Steak w/ mash & gravy and grilled veggies (zuccini & squash). I asked the waitress to make sure the steak was Medium Rare to Medium and she assured it would be.  It was cooked to perfection!! AND also Crabcakes Benedict w/Avocado added...whaaaaaaaaaaaat!!! The hollandaise sauce was perfect and the egg was dripping with yoke as the fork slid through it . My only suggestion would be to put that fresh Avocado on top after the structure is complete. The way it was made, with the Avo in the middle, made it warm and lost the essence of the cool Avocado. But...all in all, it was delicious. Thanks Alot!!  The wait staff is top notch as well! Our server, Autumn, was very tentative and made sure we were taken care of during start to finish. She made sure our FOOD was correct and looking fantastic!! The manager, as well, was on top of anything that we needed. She made a clear pressence on the floor.  I give the team an all around A+  Thank You!! Eat HERE Yummy yum yum tum tum tum!!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, hostess was amazing and waitress was very impressive and informative! Hillary was our waitress so great!!"}
{"text":"Arrived early on a Sunday morning to beat the rush. I've seen lines outside the door since this location opened about one month ago. We were seated right away. After  a few minutes the server arrived, we placed our order and as she was walking away - we let her know what we wanted to drink - Yes she forgot to ask, before leaving the table. To our surprise they had flavored pumpkin spice coffee,  It was was very good.  I ordered the Western omelette, which I found flavorful but lacking any real amount of ham. Hash browns were good and crispy but the portion was small. Wifey liked her veggie omelette and the tomatoes that were served in place of her hash browns (she's always watching the carbs). She was offered fruit or tomatoes at no extra charge.   Service was good, maybe a little inexperienced but very nice.  Good thing we arrived early because by the time we left, people were lining up inside and out.  I'm not sure I'll be back for breakfast, but I will try their lunch / dinner menu. I was informed that they serve their entire menu breakfast/lunch/dinner all day.  No delivery at this time, but you can place an order and come pick it up."}
{"text":"This was fantastic!!! Everything: food, ambiance, food, staff, price, and food! There was a wait (Sunday morning) but well worth it. We had crab cake eggs Benedict and 3 egg breakfast. I had the \"works\" over hash browns which included peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, ham, and cheese so much cheese... I need a nap. They serve the entire menu all day. Hard to make a decision. Will definitely return for the shrimp and grits. Yes, I was checking out everyone else's food and it all looked amazing. Actually like the pictures..."}
{"text":"OMG, the chicken and biscuit is to die for! I didn't have the chicken and waffle, but I'm sure it's just as good as the chicken and biscuit, bc they use the same sauce for both dishes. The service was good. For as crowded as it was when I went, we sat and got served pretty quickly. I will most definitely be coming back. I just found me a new breakfast spot! I would like to make a suggestion though, I wish the coffee was a little stronger."}
{"text":"Good food,but a  bit pricey. I had 3 eggs and bacon it was cooked perfect but only 3 skinny pieces of bacon Total bill for breakfast and coffee was 14.92 plus tip. I understand overhead but thought the price would make me think twice about coming back."}
{"text":"Their food is really good. I love the meatloaf with mashed potatoes with zucchini. The service is not so good. After i finished my dish i sat there for 10 minutes before anybody took my plate. When im done eating at a diner i just want to get my check and leave, not sit here by myself waiting 10 minutes for a check. Owell, hopefully better next time."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. I went with my husband to the Metro Diner on a Saturday around noontime. There was a half hour wait, but we were seated in about 20 minutes. The place was full, and it was busy. We ordered breakfast and we enjoyed it. I had a waffle with fruit on top and turkey sausage links. I ate every bit of my food. It was delicious!! The waffle was cooked perfectly, and I've never had turkey sausage that tasted that good. My husband had an array of breakfast items. He said his pancakes were very good. The only thing he thought was just okay was the hash browns. He said they could have been cooked longer. Overall, we enjoyed our food and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Excellent fruity waffle with the best turkey sausage I've ever tasted!! There's always a crowd at the Metro Diner, and this was no exception.  The place is buzzing, the waitstaff are friendly and the atmosphere is casual and relaxing. Recommended."}
{"text":"Although I'm not a diner fan, I gave this place a try for my husband's sake. The kid's pancakes were all air - no substance or flavor. The spicy honey chicken biscuit sounded great but the biscuit flaked apart and got soggy from their honey sauce, there was nothing to it but for $4.99 I left half and didn't bother to complain...my husband left half his meal and that alone spoke words (he rarely leaves food on the plate)! So, not sure why this place has so many positive reviews, but with great competition around the neighborhood - I don't see this place lasting long, then again Denny's is still around (Insert gross face)!"}
{"text":"Man, I hate jumping right into a 5-star review on a first trip, but there's really nothing they could have done to make our experience better. The place was hoppin' at 9 am on a Sunday, and we got the last two seats at the bar... which was awesome because we got to see all the food being made! It was like a well-oiled machine watching the kitchen staff and wait staff, who genuinely seemed to enjoy what they were doing.  The fella and I both got boring breakfasts (eggs, meat, potatoes, bread), but they had plenty to choose from to not be boring. I was tempted by some of the sweeter offerings, but I was trying to stay relatively healthy. Ha! Our waitress was super nice, engaging, and right on point with timing. The food came out fast and had generous portions and only cost $19 (including a small OJ). I also appreciated that we were able to pay right at our seat with an iPad - no standing in line or waiting for someone to bring your card back.  By the time we left around 10 am, there was a line around the block, so get there early or be prepared to wait - it's worth it."}
{"text":"What a breath of fresh air! Clean as clean can be. The Pot roast was fork tender and moist. The broth was flavorful and can only be made if it is made in house. The vegetables in the pot roast were full of flavor too. The wife's Fried Chicken and waffles were juicy and went well with the fluffy waffles of love. The secret sauce was a balance of sweet, savory and spice. It did not  over power your taste buds with brute force. It politely said please try me and played well with the entire dish.  I saw the staff wash their hands constantly. The service by Mrs Bernadette made my bride and I feel like regulars on the first visit.  We will be back to see what other treasures are to be found."}
{"text":"Great diner. I had a delicious spinach salad with grilled chicken and my daughter had a burger cooked perfectly. Friendly staff and warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"Visited for breakfast. First time here, prompt and great service. There is nothing \"special\" about the food but, it's as good as you can make breakfast!!! Nothing was lacking flavor, it was hot, tasted fresh. Good fresh food and great service for the 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"I finally took the hubby here. I had been to a Yelp event, but this was my first time on a normal night. It was very busy, but a hostess greeted us and sat us right away.   It seemed like after that, service was a little slow. People were running food like crazy, but it was just busy.   The food is awesome. Having tried a lot of the menu already, I decided to try the turkey plate. It was amazing. The turkey was tender and topped with a savory gravy. Sides included mashed red potatoes which were fluffy and buttery and sauteed squash and zucchini.  This may have been my favorite part of the dish. Not too buttery or overcooked and some crunch. It was so good, I wondered if they did Thanksgiving meals to go.  My husband ordered the Holy Divoli, which has been featured on DDD so you know it has to be crazy. This is no ordinary cheeseburger. They take two grilled cheese sandwiches that have bacon and tomato and use those as the bun! Then you have a very generous burger patty with a homemade pickle relish. And it comes with a side of fries. He wasn't able to finish.   If you're looking for comfort food and large portions, come here!"}
{"text":"Been there about 10 times now and the food is DELICIOUS!!!!!  1. Chocolate chip banana pancakes --yummy  2. Chicken and waffles--the best chicken ever comes out nice and crispy. The hot sauce and pancake syrup is the best combination that goes with that dish 3. Chicken tenders with their honey mustard is amazing.  4. Monte cristo 5. Philly cheese steak  6. Chicken pot pie 7. Burgers --ehh hit or miss 8. Grits & Mac and cheese A MUST TRY  Desserts- ALL OF THE COBBLERS are perfect.    The managers are extremely polite. They come over to make sure everything is good. The servers are great they always come back to see if you need anything else and are always making sure to ask if you need a drink refill.  This place is great to eat at. Only problem is when you go there often it's the same old boring menu once you have almost gone through half of it. But there's always specials you can try if you like and the waiter will let you know what they are once you sit down."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some good ol' comfortable home cooking, look no further than Metro Diner. We are big fans of \"breakfast for dinner\" so Metro's all day breakfast menu pleased us. Make sure to go with an appetite, because the amount of food you get for your money is large. Great place to take the family any time of day!"}
{"text":"Noticed these places popping up around Vegas and a friend asked me to breakfast, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to try this place out.  When you walk into the place, there's a clear \"diner\" feel, as expected. There is a large specials menu board in the back that the host points out to you as they walk you to your table, if you've never been there before. (The specials are basically just variations on normal menu items)   I love a good breakfast! They offer breakfast, lunch and dinner all day long (I love when that happens lol). The menu is laid out in a very simple-to-understand fashion and shows *in green* what the most popular items are. Prices are very fair. I had a \"favorite\"--the corned beef hash with poached eggs and a biscuit. My friend had the french toast special that was listed on the specials board this morning (not sure how often the specials change, but today is 09/15/17), and we both had the \"special\" hazelnut flavored coffee.   Everything was DELICIOUS (I tried some of my friend's french toast, too). The coffee was amazing (why can't I ever seem to achieve diner-style coffee at home?? They make it look so easy), the service was impeccable and the entire experience from entry to exit was wonderful. Everyone was friendly and made sure that our dining was top-notch.  My ooooooooooonly problem (and it wasn't huge, seeing as I didn't even bring it to management's attention) was that my food arrived kinda... cold? Not freezing. Not undercooked. Just... not as warm as I expected it to be when first coming to the table (and I mean, I dug in pretty quickly). The corned beef tasted great! But because it was slightly room temp, it took a little bit of the enjoyment out of it. And the biscuit most certainly wouldn't have melted butter if I had put some on it--just as a reference for how \"not hot\" my food was.  I will be back, there's no doubt about that. I love the atmosphere and look forward to trying different things on the menu, too."}
{"text":"I have become quite the regular here over the past few months and not once have I been disappointed! From the food to the service, it's always great! No matter how busy it is the wait is never long for your food and the servers are always so nice and on top of things. Today we had Maggie and she was great! Being in the service industry there's nothing I appreciate more than seeing people who are happy to be at work and take pride in what they do. I'll definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I went the the soft opening with my family and the food and service were absolutely amazing. I ordered the Monte Cristo and I was only able to eat like 1/3 of it. My mom ordered the fried chicken and it was incredible as well! If I lived in Vegas I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"After writing an average review for this diner, the manager reached out to extend an offer of coupons to come back and try them out again. That's really great customer service and I appreciate that. I have since been back 2 more times to try out different dishes. This place is just not for me sadly. The food is still average in my opinion and a bit pricey. But, they really do have amazing customer service. The entire staff is attentive and very friendly."}
{"text":"It's ok. The macaroni and cheese was not delicious. The French dip was fine. Chili was not great.  What was great however, was the service!  We couldn't have asked for a more attentive and nice server. A+ on that count."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. Pastrami was a normal pastrami sandwich nothing to rave home about. The pork sandwich was HUGE! Interesting. I might try it again."}
{"text":"Second time to Metro and yes the food is still good, the service is outstanding, the people really like what they do and it shows.  They don't have the tablets for check out because they could not keep up with the demand for service, hope they bring it back since it makes you feel very secure that your credit card does not leave your sight. All age groups are eating there so something for everyone, give it a try."}
{"text":"Wasnt world rocking... To greasy for my liking.. Screwed up my whole order..Waitress brought it out anyway and told me \" hey They screwed up your order but get started anyway\" umm ok but this isnt what I ordered.. Never brought out the correct order and then ended up charging me for it. Not great."}
{"text":"Service was great. I thought it was a nice touch that the owner came by to see how we were enjoying our meal. Ordered the half order of chicken and waffles since reviews were raving about this dish. It did not disappoint. Although I love wings and it wasn't an option, I still enjoyed the juicy chicken and the strawberry butter on the waffle. Will be back to try a few more dishes. So far I will give you 2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time this week, first impression super friendly and accommodating folks work at this restaurant. Food is really good, breakfast all day long who doesn't love breakfast for lunch or dinner. Portions are big so bring your appetite. Next time I stop in I'm trying chicken and waffles they look amazing."}
{"text":"Uh.... oh yeah! Super crazy delicious! Fast. Flavorful & Friendly.  Came in for the first time today. The drink bar is brilliant. The menu is complete. From breakfast to dinner the selection is well rounded and lots to choose from.  I had the Frisco Breakfast Sandwich. It was huge, buttery, and freaking delicious! My son had the Vortex Burger.  A burger where the bread is two grilled cheese sandwiches with bacon?!Holy mother of messy burger goodness.  It was everything he wanted and more.  Welcome to the neighborhood Metro Diner. We are thrilled you are here!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Service was excellent! My waitress was always on top on refilling my coffee and water. The wait for the food to come out was not very long even though every table in the place was full. I ordered corn beef and hash. It was very good but I did have to church it up with salt, pepper and hot sauce. I totally recommend this dinner to everyone! Parking is the only issue. The location has a very small parking lot. Had to park across the street at the wear houses."}
{"text":"First time here, will definitely be back. This is a great place and very friendly staff Chicken and Waffles the Halal French toast everything very good. Darla will break it down for you great great service and lots of food for the price"}
{"text":"I live very close to this place and finally tried it for breakfast. Very good! We had the chicken and waffles as well as the biscuits and gravy. Both were great! The chicken and waffles were better than any I've ever had in New Orleans. Must try!"}
{"text":"If you have been reading previous reviews about this place, they are not lying! Chicken and Waffles does it for me! Talk about fresh and full of flavor, hands down this is my go to meal every time I come here!"}
{"text":"Love Metro Diner! I've eaten here a few times, and the food and as well as the wait staff never disappoint.   My favorite item on the menu is their Chicken Salad Salad. This has chunks of white meat chicken mixed with just the right amount of mayonnaise, purple grapes, celery, and more. A generous amount of chicken salad is placed in the center of iceberg lettuce with croutons and a full hard boiled egg. Not only is this salad very filling, but you're also able to purchase the chicken salad on its own to go."}
{"text":"I was visiting from CA and when I'm in town I do try to patronize a restaurant off the strip.  I found this breakfast restaurant on Yelp, it had good reviews and the food pics were great.  We went for breakfast and service was great! The food delicious."}
{"text":"We loved the food and the service was great.  I had the meat loaf and it was different from any meatloaf I have ever had before.  It was denser and more hearty.  Delicious. We were too full for dessert but will be back to try it again."}
{"text":"Maybe I got the wrong thing. Got the French dip, decent flavor, nothing special and same with the fires. Liked the razberry un-sweet tea. Probably closer to a 3.5,  nice service, maybe go for a dinner plate or breakfast but not rushing back to do so"}
{"text":"This place has a great menu and the idea is there, but the flavor is not. I had the chicken pot pie and it was ok - not the best I've had, I still like Marie Callendar's and Yardhouse's better (even though they stopped offering it). My hubby had the turkey and didn't think it was anything special either. I hear they have good breakfast so will probably come back to try that. Servers are very attentive and quick."}
{"text":"Came here after reading Yelp reviews. Pre-planned on trying the chicken and waffles. I don't know why, but somehow I misread and thought you get half a waffle. Nope. You get HALF A CHICKEN! I had Indian Buffet earlier that day and couldn't finish all of my food. Brought it home later and devoured it. The chicken and waffles was really good. The strawberry butter is a plus. My server was very friendly and talkative. She also made some sweet and spicy concoction in this little saucer to go with my meal. It was ok but I preferred the regular syrup. The manager even came by to ensure everything was cool. The servers and hostesses have a really chill vibe (almost as if they're high lol) but I loved it. They were super easy going but attentive. Everyone was friendly. I tried the raspberry ice tea (sweetened), which was the featured drink of the day but I didn't like it at all. They let me change it out to a Sprite with no problem. Atmosphere was cool. Nice diner decor. Very clean and well kept. I would definitely come back whenever I return to Vegas."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic. Our server Matthew was very friendly and prompt. The chicken and waffles were great. Chicken was crispy and juicy and the waffles were golden and delicious. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and wanted to get breakfast before driving back to L.A. When we pulled into the parking lot there were two Henderson police cruisers parked in front of the restaurant. My friend said that was a good sign because cops usually know where the better places are to grab a bite. Well, he was right because it turned out to be the most delicious waffle breakfast I've had in a long time. They even served real maple syrup (not the fake stuff that claims it's real but is made in a factory.) The tea selection was on par with what you'd expect at an afternoon tea in Kensington. Our server was friendly and efficient. Food came out quickly yet we never felt rushed.  The manager even thanked us personally and held the door open for us on our way out. Lesson of the day: When in doubt, dine where the cops do :D"}
{"text":"I had met a few friends here for lunch the place was pretty busy but the staff is very attentive to you and the food is a decent price and very good food"}
{"text":"I love love LOVE this place. This will definitely be my new spot. We had the chicken & waffles and the meatloaf dinner. It was all amazing and a lot of food for the price. Jessie was our server and he was definitely engaging and helpful. We'll be back. And soon!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here consistently for about three months every week or two. Excellent breakfast, fried chicken and waffle signature dish was very nice. Service is always prompt but not rushed. Like the variety of dishes; everything from avocado toast to meat loaf dinners. My wife likes their chicken salad.  Everything I want from a diner - breakfast, lunch and a decent hearty dinner."}
{"text":"Expensive for low grade food and mediocre service.  This area needs a restaurant that serves good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I really love this diner! The menu is more extensive than you might expect, and everything is wonderful in flavor, presentation, and temp. This place knows how to satisfy its customers! Staff is attentive, ambiance is vibrant, and their coffee is great always. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"For a diner, the wait is pretty long at breakfast time, but fortunately, they have a coffee bar available for folks waiting.  The food was good, but not really exceptional.  I had a omelet, which was good, and hash browns, which were just a bit over.  My wife had Huevos Rancheros, which were also good, but the ratio of meat to beans, to sauce to cheese seemed a bit off (heavy on the beans).  The dish was really huge, so they could just reduce the beans and keep everything the same to make a better dish.  I'm sure we will give them another chance."}
{"text":"We were invited to the Soft Opening and I don't think the experience could have been any better. Besides amazing, fresh food (Breakfast Bowl, Eggs Benedict, Corn Beef Hash and a new twist on Huevos Rancheros), they also have a help yourself beverage area. We met the owner and founder of the Metro Diners (and Outback Steakhouses), and he had a remarkable story. The staff were on point and super pleasant. We can't wait to go back to try more of their huge menu options! Bravo!"}
{"text":"I live in Texas and have therefore eaten chicken and waffles countless times. Not something I would think to order in Vegas. I went for it given it was the most popular dish on the menu.  So glad I did! The chicken was cooked to perfection and waffles were light and fluffy, not too dense. Amazing strawberry butter with actual strawberries. This meal was made complete with pumpkin spice coffee.  So good.   Service was also on point - Kelly was attentive and kind.   Will be back for this exact meal."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and i were looking for a breakfast place and happened across this one. With all the construction around the area it was a bit annoying to get in the plaza as the only entrance was east bound on warm springs. I ordered the huevos rancheros, but didn't like it too much, but i think it's just my taste buds because it looked good lol. And girlfriend of course got a crab Benedict. She didn't like it as much as the others she's had tho. We ordered coffee which it their house blend and it was surprisingly tasty compared to most breakfast coffees we had. The diner is nice and the staff is friendly as well. Will have to go again and try something else and adjust review accordingly!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and not coming back. When the food arrived it looked pretty good but cold, the egg in omelet was over cooked and hash browns undercook but cold if that makes sense. Wanted to order dessert but the bill was dropped while we were eating, I did not like that."}
{"text":"Always looking to try new places, Metro Diner did not disappoint. The service was fantastic, every employee had a smile and offered a friendly \"hello\". I got the Crab Cake Benedict, it was PERFECTION! The crab cakes are made in house, I was a little concerned that the crab cakes with the hollandaise sauce might be too rich but no need for concern, it was one of the tastiest Benedict's I have ever had. The hash-browns (ordered crispy) were fantastic. Paired with a raspberry iced tea (fresh brew not that fountain or raspberry syrup, yuck!) it was one of the best meals I've had. I can't wait to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"We did return and although our service was good the food was still \"meh\". We tried different breakfast items. Nothing truly outstanding. The most disappointing item was the french toast. We had to send it back. My son did not want anything else since this is the second time he did not like what he ordered. The manager did stop by, offered to put in an order for something else, and he advised us to next time request that the french toast be cooked on the grill since they are originally fried. We declined his offer and thanked him. We appreciated his effort and thought.  Overall, after the second visit, I can't help but feel the food here lacks \"freshness\". Everything is either fried in funnel cake oil, drenched in bland sauces, overcooked, undercooked, or lacks depth of flavor."}
{"text":"We had heard lots of good things about this place so we gave it a shot. I got the Ruben, which is my standard by which I judge places. The wife got the Monte Cristo and my daughter the Fruity Waffle. The proportions were good, although the waffle was just a Belgium waffle with a little fruit. She got a side of bacon making it the most expensive dish at the table. She said it was strangely dry inside and our waffles at home are better. The Monte Cristo was huge, but the batter was very thick and grease would run down her hand when she bit into it. My Reuben had a good amount of corned beef. I had mentioned that the photos on Yelp varied greatly as to the amount of meat. The waitress confirmed that it does vary a lot. I asked for the fuller version. The corned beef was good, but the sandwich as a whole was kinda strange. First of all it was very juicy for a sandwich. Juice (juice, grease, sauce?) would run down my chin when I bit into it. Usually you can easily identify the cheese, sauerkraut and sauce but in this I couldn't. It seemed like it was all one thing. It was also really strong and overpowered the meat. Very messy to eat. We went away very disappointed."}
{"text":"The servers were very nice and provided good service throughout the whole meal. The portion were big and my husband's shrimp and grits tasted great. The chicken salad was a little dry but still good. They had spacious seating and a great atmosphere. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I lived in Jacksonville for many years and ate at the original Metro Diner quite often. It's nice to visit one in Vegas with the same quality and consistency as the original. Our waitress was so friendly and attentive. We were seated right away and the food came out fast and delicious."}
{"text":"I'm giving them 4 stars because the place was clean and the staff were friendly. I came here after seeing them on the news and had mentioned it to my bf a few days before that. But it wasn't anything to rave about. I'm super picky with my French toast and it was just too soggy for me. Plus with the ft and waffles we only got two small containers of syrup. Dude. I needed like four."}
{"text":"My fiance and I ate at the location in Henderson and it was amazing! Our waiter Chelsea was very upbeat and welcoming. Our food was excellent. In a city where customer service seems to fall to the way side I was very pleased with my experience. Chelsea you are still awesome. We look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"OMG this place was GREAT.  Hubby and I visited on a Monday for brunch and we so delighted at how great it was.  Our server, Jessica, was just the best.  Her 3rd day on the job and so attentive.  I had the breakfast pie.....to die for.  Also had biscuits and gravy and they were DELISH.  Totally recommend this for breakfast at least."}
{"text":"Where to begin? After a horrible first trip I decided to give it another shot. I called on the phone to do a to go order and the lady (Darla?) took my order. She told me it would take 15 minutes to complete order. When I arrived the 2 ladies at the front said they had to locate my server to get my order. 10 minutes later no server arrived, when I asked the lady at the stand she said nobody must have gotten the server yet. I don't understand the horrible service for now the second time, these restaurants are dime a dozen in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times have been great on customer service. On my first visit I had the French Toast Special and I absolutely cleaned my plate. Tonight was the chicken and waffles and it was pretty good - the waffle with the strawberry butter was awesome. The chicken was pretty good, some may think a little overdone but I like mine that way. Only issue on the 2nd visit was my sweet tea tasted a little dated, and that was probably from being in the early dinner crowd where it was probably leftover from lunch. Jay our server was from NY and did an awesome job, we live close by so we will be regulars here, try them out!"}
{"text":"This place is a win in every way.  I've only been for breakfast but my family has enjoyed many lunches there also.  The atmosphere is so welcoming and each booth and table have a sense of intimacy where the conversations stay within the company you came with.  When you think of diner, you think of basic but this diner is anything but.  The portions are large and always presented and tasted that the chef took pride in making it.  The staff is ALWAYS friendly and remembers you.  Winner winner nutty french toast winner!!  ;)  GO and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Finally stopped & tried this place last night. My family & I really enjoyed it! Decently priced & big portion plates. Everything is homemade which makes it some nice comfort food. It was pretty crowded but we were greeted & seated right away. Friendly staff & our server was knowledgeable about the menu & attentive. I definitely want to come back & explore the menu more. So many options & variety!"}
{"text":"Usually I hate breakfast food and I have to be in the mood, but since I'm on a diet I've been forcing myself to have the most important meal of the day haha.   Came here for a high carb/cheat meal. I had the biscuits and sausage gravy with two over medium eggs and home fried potatoes. Yuuuum! They were the best biscuits and gravy I had in a while. The biscuits were so crispy on the edges and soft on the inside (my fav) and the gravy had a good taste. Portions are very generous. I barely touched my potatoes, only had an egg, and maybe 2/4 of the biscuits. It was a lot and I was so stuffed. I was also able to try the strawberry butter (extra charge) with toast and butter and damn that was gooood.   Large portions, cheap prices, good service.. what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"There's plenty to like at this diner out of Florida. My favorite thing to date has been their fried chicken and waffles. The texture of the waffle was great -- light and crispy, just like I like it and the chicken was so tender and juicy thanks to them brining the bird over night. The crust is nice and thick and well seasoned. It's a huge portion with half a bird, so plan on sharing.  The crab cake benedict was really good, too. Lots of crab meat with a modest amount of filler, fried and topped with eggs with a side of home fries. Also popular is their Charleston shrimp and grits. They take the grits and form them into blocks that are fried, then covered in gravy and shrimp. It's mighty tasty with just enough spice to let your taste buds know they're there. It's filled with plenty of shrimp and overall a huge portion size.  On the sweeter side, they have different types of stuffed French toasts. The \"Apple yo halla\" was available on our first visit. It was like a cheesecake sandwiched between challah French toast topped with fried apples.  With a second location recently opened and ambitious plans to greatly expand their empire, I can only hope that they can maintain the high quality food at each spot."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with some friends because of the positive reviews and I'd say this place is decent.  I ended up ordering the stuffing waffle which is basically a waffle made from stuffing that is topped with mashed potatoes and turkey with brown gravy. I decided to order this since it is currently one of their specials. The waffle itself was pretty good in terms of flavor because I was actually able to taste the stuffing. I loved how crispy the waffle was, but unfortunately half of the waffle ended up being soggy because of the moisture and heat from being covered by the mashed potatoes and turkey. I think the dish would have been better if everything was plated separately instead of on a stack. The portion is pretty big and I'd say it's enough for two people. The turkey was pretty dry and didn't have much flavor. I wish I had more gravy for my mashed potatoes because all of the gravy just ended up on the turkey itself. No one likes eating mashed potatoes without gravy right?   Overall the food was decent, but the service was pretty good. The waiter was very personable and kept an eye on our table. I'd probably come back here and try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  The staff is SUPER DUPER friendly but unfortunately that can't make up for flavorless food. I came for breakfast and it was ok - pancakes tasted like nothing. This evening I'm back for dinner and ordered fish & chips - no flavor and not crispy at all. Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Diner in Charlotte. The food is amazing the waiters and waitresses are super friendly!I have not had a bad experience with Metro Diner and I am 100 % sure that you Won't either. The chicken and waffles are amazing. All of the Yo Hallah's are delicious"}
{"text":"This place is definitely not what I expected! The food is so bland. There was no flavor at all! The food came out cold."}
{"text":"I've been excited for this diner to open as I've heard great things about their other locations. Went in around 12:30pm on a Friday and waited about 15 minutes for a table, however I expected that with a brand new restaurant in this area. The inside is absolutely adorable! All the staff were excellent, very friendly and attentive. Only downfall is that It is a little pricey, although the food is wonderful! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had their Chorizo stuffed burger today and it was excellent.  My server was very attentive and friendly.  She kept our coffee and waters filled with a smile.  She even took the care to pre-bus our table as soon as she saw the empty plates.  I told the manager about the good service my server gave me.  Will definitely be back on a regular basis"}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice and can't get pass the special board . Both were great . Will try to look at the menu next."}
{"text":"New to NC and to Huntersville, we drove by this diner many times with no desire to drop by. I can't remember how we ended up eating here, but I'm so glad we did! They're awesome!    The customer service is excellent, the food is remarkable and their prices are reasonable. My absolute favorite is the Country Fried Steak, but don't sleep on their Meatloaf it's also amazing. Their breakfast is also delicious and I believe it's available all day.   The ONLY area I feel they can improve on is the dessert options. Other than that we love this place."}
{"text":"The food was okay. My husband and I came here for the first time.it was pretty crowded. You can pay for advertising on their place table matt things just I thought was cool."}
{"text":"Don't understand good reviews at all. Would not recommend at all.  We rec'd a $10 gift card so went to check it out by ordering something basic..grilled cheese sandwich and tomato bisque soup. Figured if that was good we'd order more.  First ventillation is poor and smell of grease is overpowering. Soup was so thick it was like red sludge loaded with overloaded chucks of partially cooked onion, not even a good flavor and far far from being a bisque. Cheese sandwich was not hot enough and cheese was like rubber.  French fries were just okay. They say it's down home southern cooking..to us it is just a greasy spoon with a fancy name and an insult to southern food.  Maybe other entrees are better.  My contention is and always will be..if it's on the menu and it's being served, it should all be up to par and good. Only plus was the waiter was very friendly and punctual."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I've been here. The first time we went fir breakfast.  Then, I got huevos rancheros. They were to die for! This time I had the fried chicken plate with mashed potatoes and squash. This was excellent.  My group also had the Pittsburgh and philidelphia cheese steak sandos and the chicken and waffles. Every one loved what they got. The waitress was very helpful with her suggestions and the staff was very friendly.  I plan to make my 3rd time to the metro diner very soon!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch today. My bf was so happy to learned this place has opened here cos he loved the one located in Jacksonville.  I ordered the Crab Eggs Benedict... the Benedict part was amazing- it had a tasty sauce, a nice crunch on the bread, and the egg perfectly poached. The hash browns that came with it were actually shredded potatoes and they were so deliciously moist and flavorful.  My bf ordered chicken and waffles. The strawberry creme that they serve with the waffles were very appetizing. The dipping sauce of syrup and hot sauce makes the taste to a whole level. We also ordered Three cheese grilled sandwich to go. The portions are very large for the price and we did not walk away feeling hungry.   The waitress is friendly. We had a big piece of fried chicken and waffle left on the plate and she forgot to ask if we wanted a box. She took the plates away and later we realized it and went to ask her. The manager who was standing next to her is nice and made a new piece of chicken and waffle to go.   If you are in the area you definitely have to check out this establishment."}
{"text":"Love the monte Cristo. Great place for breakfast/brunch, but they also have good lunch and dinner options."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast this morning and John opened the door for us. We were seated right away by a sweet young lady. John was actually our server and he was helpful and nice, he came to check on us a couple of times and made recommendations as to what we should eat since it was our fist time there. My mom and sister had the chicken and waffles and they were great, I ordered the frutty waffle and I loved it, it was huge. Great for a breakfast for sure, food came out super fast. Once we were almost done a gentleman came and asked us how everything was and if we had and complaints but we enjoyed everything from our meal to the service. The fruit on my waffle was fresh and my waffle was fluffy, my side of hash brows were crispy on the outside just like I like them. Great food and good prices!"}
{"text":"Yesssss!  This place is off the chain!  It was a packed house!  They said it would be a 15 min wait, but it was more like 5 min.    Now I've never been a waitress or should I say hostess, but we were a party of 2 and there was a single guy there.  Wouldn't it be better if he got a table that was for 2 and the party of 2 get the table that was for 4?  Because our table had so many plates on it, we had to be careful not to tip anything over.  JS!  I got the chicken and waffles, you get 1 leg 1 wing, 1 breast and 1 thigh!  No I didn't eat it all, I shared 1/2 of my chicken with  my husband.  I also ordered hash browns and eggs on the side.  When you order the checken and waffles, Our waitress Ashley, came over and poured some syrup in a bowl, (I was thinking!  Wow there stingy with the syrup) but then she put some hot sauce in with the syrup....I'm thinking what the heck is she doing!  It's something to dip your chicken in. I kinda'sorta liked it.  The hash browns were ok the eggs were good.  And I was stuffed!  My husband got the croissant french toast!  I didn't care for it, but I don't care for french toast.   He liked it.   So our bill was pretty hefty for a breakfast!  like $49.00.  Ashley was a great waitress, she made sure we had everything we needed, and her skills were on point.  I will be back.  They had other things on the menu I would like to try!"}
{"text":"Metro Diner is one of those places you would find while on vacation. A hidden gem, you can't help return to every morning for breakfast. It feels family owned and has a comfortable atmosphere for those with small kids, which is becoming more and more hard to find in the LKN area.  I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. When I first cut into it the poached egg was a little too well done. When I mentioned it to Tasha our server she quickly ran to have it fixed. She was so apologetic you would have thought she cooked it! The manager Lyla came over right away to apologize and assure me they are making me a new one and already took it off our check. She was so attentive and sweet again, made me question if she cooked it. So personable! I hated and hate complaining. When my new one came it was perfect! Lyla and Brittney (GM) both made sure to come over and check. The crab cake is homemade and truly delicious. My Pop owns a restaurant and is one of the top known Chefs in LKN (Wes Choplin) he makes a MEAN crab cake. Metro Diner definitely deserves to be up next to his. My husband can be a real jerk when it comes to pancakes, he is one of those \"pancake masters\" and is a true critic. He ate his so fast and wouldn't shush about how delicious they were (big deal in our house). Our boys had waffles and they of course were a hit. One would think I would have something negative to say because my meal was off. But if you know anything about an Eggs Benedict you know they can be difficult, so i can only imagine having to do it on a Saturday morning in a restaurant with a line out the door. I praise that Chef! I'm not big on writing reviews, but with my Pops owning a restaurant (Choplins in Cornelius) and working in it, I truly know how important it is to give praise when and where needed. Its the little praises that keeps us going, especially when it comes to hospitality. So, 5 stars to the entire restaurant staff including that Chef! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great food! Went here on a whim while in Las Vegas while looking for something different for dinner. Service was great. Definitely a go to for homestyle cooking. We ordered the Stuffing Waffle special, and the Holy Davoli burger which were both great!! The staff was friendly and welcoming, just like in a diner from your hometown. We will absolutely be returning when back in town!!"}
{"text":"Good service, great menu, fair prices.... really good food....wife had apple challah..wow more like a dessert, but amazing.. and she had corned beef hash... said it was great....i had great spicy honey biscuit, and side of bacon.... loved it"}
{"text":"Awful service and we won't be back.    My wife and I arrived at 9 AM on a Sunday.  It wasn't terribly busy, only half the tables were full.  We told the employee at the podium that we wanted a table for 2 and she directed us to sit down.  We sat on the bench in front of the podium and waited.  As we were sitting down, the only other people waiting -- a party of 6 -- were called to their table.  At that point we were the only people waiting in their small waiting area.  A minute or two later another couple comes in and asks for a table for two.  There are two ladies behind the podium who can clearly see us waiting, and one of them immediately seats the two people that just came in.   My wife and I got up and left immediately.  I told the remaining person at the podium that it was really rude to not seat us before a couple that just came in.  She did not apologize but only told me \"She didn't say anyone else was waiting.\"  Hello?  Use your eyes.  We were literally sitting less than 5 feet in front of you!  We won't be back again.  Took a trip down the street to Pam's Glorified Ham & Eggs and the service was MUCH better there."}
{"text":"It was what you think a modern diner would be like.  There is a counter to sit at or tables and booths.  The menu is classic with items like burgers and sandwiches. They are famous for this chicken and waffles. I did not have the chicken and waffles but it looked amazing. I had the club sandwich and it was great. Two types of cheese, ham and turkey with bacon. It was mammoth in size and I got a heaping pile of fries.  My husband had the Philly cheesesteak and it looked mouth watering. I will get it next time.  The service was on point. Attentive yet not overbearing. Just enough attention to ensure you get what you need and drinks stay refilled."}
{"text":"My family & I ate here for the first time last week. I just moved to Charlotte so of course I used Yelp to find good food. This place did not disappoint! They have a drink station that has water, tea, coffee & soda and a menu so great it was almost impossible to make a choice. I got the croissant French toast and it was delicious! It came with 4 pieces but it was so rich I could only eat one. My fianc√© got the breakfast pie & my mom got biscuits & gravy. Everything was so delicious, I'm not sure you could make a bad choice! Highly recommend this adorable diner!"}
{"text":"Just want to say I stopped in on Wednesday for breakfast and had the best service ever. Autumn was our server and she was an exquisite delight that everyone should experience. She was so polite and funny. She'll for sure make your day full of happiness. She recommend the special (meet lovers omelet) and it was the right call. This omelet was so big I couldn't finish even thought I wanted every bite for myself. I had to share. So please share in this experience."}
{"text":"BEST. SERVER. EVER. Give this woman a raise! It is so hard to meet genuine down to earth people in this down and most of the time when it comes to servers you hardly ever get one that truly cares about your experience.  Definitely not the case here.  Our server was Jaci and she made sure my son and I were well taken care of...we didn't have to ask for ANYTHING...she had everything we needed on the table before we even thought about it. It looked like she had quite a few tables, but she made it seem like we were the only ones there.  As far as the food goes...The chicken and waffles is by far the best I've ever had and that strawberry butter is just wow! My wife just came home with the reuban sandwich, well half of one anyway.... think I might have to drive back for the other half, it's AMAZING!   So in conclusion, AWESOME service and AMAZING food. We will be back and will definitely be asking for Jaci."}
{"text":"This is a great comfort food place.  Prices are good, portions good size and staff eager to please.   Ask  for daily specials.  We shared a large beef pot pie and mashed potatoes and gravy.  Loved every bite and will go back.  My husband had tried the breakfast and said it's great too!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and had a great experience. Food was delicious, great service and relaxed atmosphere. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Ok... So for us SouthWest Las Vegans, New dining outlets are a treat. ( Please put some more places in Mountains Edge)  I have already been to Metro Diner 3 times in the short time that they have been open. They are doing a very good thing so far.  First time was The Pork Tenderloin Sandwich and the Reuben. Pork sandwich was very good. Reuben flavor was good but was frankly a little thinner than I am used to ( Thats what I get for going to Jasons Deli previously).  The Second time we went for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised,  We had a great meal with Crab Benedict and the Corned Beef Hash. Crab cakes were pretty good, but in context with the meal they were very nice. English Muffin was a little too hard, though. Corned Beef hash was excellent and eggs perfectly poached. We even got the Bananas Foster Cheesecake which was fantastic.   The third visit, we figured we needed to get what they have on a lot of their signs and we got the chicken. I got Chicken and Waffles and my wife got the Chicken Dinner. Both were amazing. Chicken brined and marinated and perfectly cooked. The breast wasn't dried out and the breading was flavorful. Strawberry butter on the waffles was fantastic.   A gentleman came by and asked how our meal was and we told him how much we enjoyed the food and service. My wife asked what he did there and he politely replied.. \" Well, Im the owner\". THAT is impressive. The fact that Nick came by and was checking with tables himself says everything about this place. Please, please keep that part up, guys. Guests appreciate it.   The service was great all three times. We loved Jennifer and Maria ( sorry but I missed the other two ladies names that served us, but they were great too).   Welcome to the Neighborhood, Metro Diner. We will see you soon. ( ok, Tomorrow.... :-)  )"}
{"text":"OMG! This place really impressed me with how they marinade and fry their chicken. Close to how my mama use to make it. Somebody knows what they are doing in that kitchen. A guy stopped at our table to ask how things were? Very nice and humble gentleman. Long story short, we found out he is the owner. I hope this place continues to prosper. I would have given \"Metro Diner\" 5 stars, but when asked if we could get their monte cristo without ham, the waitress said 'no' because they are pre-made! The bananas foster cheesecake is an excellent  dessert."}
{"text":"Great food and Great  service! The treat first responders good! I love the chicken and waffles and their special sauce. It's a good comfort food location better than big franchise diners!"}
{"text":"First of all, service is very good here and attentive. Sometimes they can get a little too busy and your waiter/waitress might disappear for a bit but they really do hustle.  I got really excited when this location opened since it was really close to my home, so I've gone here probably four times since it opened. Everything I've had has been really delicious with one exception - my Holy Davoli Burger was moderately overcooked. I didn't actually notice for the first few bites but I did notice it was lacking flavor for such a ridiculous burger. It is a burger that uses grilled cheese sandwiches instead of buns.  Unfortunately the burger was probably medium-well or well done and simply had no moisture left in it, which led to the whole sandwich being dull.  Still, I've had the chicken salad sandwich, the chicken and waffles, a fruity waffle, as well as the steak sandwich with fries in it. I've also sampled a number of other dishes. The steak sandwich I would categorize as okay (just wasn't impressed by the flavor combo) and everything else has been quite delicious. Their fried chicken in particular is very good."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch. Chicken and waffles are to die for.  Super crispy and it served me and my daughter plus we had leftovers to bring home. Great service."}
{"text":"New favorite spot! Service and food is awesome and the  Chicken and waffles with strawberry butter and Louisiana hot sauce/syrup mix is my favorite! Must try."}
{"text":"I got the chicken and waffles with strawberry butter and it was AMAZING !! The chicken was so tender and full of flavor. The waffles weren't the best I've ever had, but still pretty good. I loved the strawberry butter as well ! The service was just as good as the food. Everyone was super friendly and the food came out so quick even though the restaurant was pretty full. I will definitely be going back !"}
{"text":"The food is great.its one of those dinners where you just won't to keep going back to because you have your on favorite dish.thanks metro dinner for great service."}
{"text":"Cozy establishment. Good service. Always busy but they move people fast. Well priced tasty food. Breakfast all day! Beer and wine available. Also Bloody Mary and Mimosas. NOTE: This review is for the Huntersville location"}
{"text":"Me and my husband went back to the dinner to have lunch. He got the Philly cheesesteak and I got the half sandwich and soup. The potatoe soup was amazing. Very creamy and fresh! The philly sandwich was amazing as well the meat very tender and cooked perfectly. So far all my experience with the staff has been great. Everyone is really friendly and pleasant to be around."}
{"text":"My sister and I came here after our Sunday service. I would generally give this a 5 star rating but there was some sort of miscommunication with who was waiting on our table. We sat there menus in hand for approximately 20 minutes without being approached. If we hadn't said anything, we probably wouldn't have been served. After finally being waited on, we had ordered their Tea Flavor of the Day which was Peach and oh my it was fantastic. As for entrees we had ordered the pot roast and corned beef hash. Both were amazing. Large portions with great flavor. The atmosphere was so nice and retro. It really fit the classical diner look. Will definitely be coming here again to try the Yo Hala which was highly recommended by our waiter and to enjoy their great playlist."}
{"text":"Everybody from the manager to the waitresses are so attentive to our needs. Plus the food is so good! We went here on a Sunday morning. We wanted to be seated outside and enjoy the fresh air, but shortly after we realized it's too hot and asked to be seated inside. They seated us inside no problem. The chicken is one of the best I've had! Customer service is top notch! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The BEST chicken and waffles I have ever had in my life. The homemade strawberry whip for the waffles is also to die for. Service was excellent and the atmosphere is family friendly. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken pot pie . It was delicious! The crust was very flaky . My mom had chicken and waffles . She said it was really good . But the strawberry butter was a little to sweet with the syrup. Service was also very good. We will definitely go back ."}
{"text":"This was our 1st time here. It was wonderful. I had the New Orleans shrimp and grits and my hubby had an omelette along with an egg and sausage croissant sandwich. I also ordered a mimosa. The service was good. On thing I did like was that they use electric pads to take your order. Our food came out quick. Plus when you leave you can get yourself some free coffee, soft drink or sweet tea which was a great bounce. We will be back again real soon."}
{"text":"I love Metro Diner. Ordered a few things and the waffle is great. Only down is the chicken and waffles ... the chicken to me is a little too salty. Big portions tho won't complain about portion. Will come back and try other meals."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful food.  Cozy atmosphere.  We are so happy this opened up down the street from our home."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been there about three times. My faves are the chicken and waffles with strawberries butter. Biscuits and gravy are soooooo good! Overall this place is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I had a 5 star experience my first visit and then a one star experience on my second visit.  I went ahead and gave it a third attempt on a Friday after work.  I'm going to give this restaurant 4/5 stars. I ordered the french toast combo breakfast.  It was fantastic!  I will say that I prefer the croissant french toast that I had previously.  The service that I received was fantastic.  There was a little bit of a wait once I got seated at my table but other than that, everything was great.  I will be back again."}
{"text":"Great place.  Huge quantities of very good diner food.  Breakfast all day is awesome.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Yum! I love Metro Diner. No better place to go for a delicious, classic breakfast. My favorite is the breakfast sandwich. It's so cheesy.  Don't let the name fool you. This isn't just some roadside diner. This place is legit and takes its food very seriously. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"First time here and the reviews are correct! From the front door, the staff is very friendly and inviting. There is cold water and hot coffee available while you wait. Plenty of seating while you wait for your table. Food options are plenty and delicious"}
{"text":"Just finished my breakfast. Had the Boswell- everything was perfectly cooked and delicious. My son had the fruity French toast. Also delicious. The best thing about this place though is the people. Friendliest staff. We sat at the counter in front of the kitchen and we thoroughly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal supporter of Metro Diner in Raleigh for some time now. I am happy to have one to enjoy in the Charlotte area as well.  Our server Taylor was beyond awesome from drinks to check (and beyond when I forgot my box of leftovers)! I love the breakfast offerings so much that I had yet to go beyond that section of the menu. Today, I finally convinced myself to try the other side. Ok, so I didn't completely step away from my fave type of food because I ended up with the breakfast burger. This ain't your typical patty with an egg on it. I was presented with a monster on a bun. The meat was well seasoned and cooked to perfection with a nice char on the outside. It was topped by a slab of cheddar, crispy hash browns, thick cut bacon, and a freshly fried egg. This burger was beautifully made and that 1st bite made me wonder what else I've been missing in this place! I wish I was exaggerating the awesomeness of this burger. My lunch date kept giving me side-eye with all of my exclamations of delight with each taste. I pride myself on trying new things but this may become my first \"usual\". As good as it was, it was too big for me to finish. The point is, have a burger. Better yet try everything because I've never had a bad bite in this place! Bring a date, the family, and your appetite this is it folks.  Service 10/10 Food 10/10"}
{"text":"Service was great a little over the top but can't really complain about too friendly of servers .  Food- food was a little bland I had the corned beef hash and English muffin .... seemed a little bland . My friend had the chef salad which was an average salad . Overall we will probably be back to try different menu items ."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable about their menu. I had the pot roast and it was great. My boyfriend got the philly cheese steak... in error, it didn't come with cheese, so half way through the meal the waitress came by the check on us. My boyfriend told her there was no cheese on his philly. She kindly offered to have cheese added, my boyfriend asked for provolone. She came back with a slice of white cheddar laying over the sandwich. Just weird.. really wanted to give this place a Rave review but when you don't add cheese to a philly CHEESE, then add American over the top of your mistake. Not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Busy place! I can see why. We took counter seats to avoid a wait. If you want to watch a serious game, sit there and watch how great the kitchen guys handle the food. There was a lot happening and not once did any one show stress or impatience. Seems as though kitchen help always gets over looked. These guys rocked it! Way to go!"}
{"text":"Metro Diner is a wonderful place to enjoy a home cooked style meal. The staff is always friendly and ready to serve. Check them out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The pictures definitely sold me on trying Metro Diner however i wasn't really impressed after dining here. I ordered one of the special items on the board which was Blueberry Cheesecake Belgian Waffle which was nothing special. I was expecting something rich but the \"cheesecake\" portion was tasteless and cold. It was basically a ball of something similar to cool whip but not and frozen blueberries. Then all topped with blueberry compote which is the only part along with the waffle itself that i ended up eating.   Service wise our waitress was lovely but she had half the restaurant and was constantly interrupted by other guests trying to get her attention while she was waiting on us. It was also not helpful when we needed butter, it was almost impossible to make eye contact with anyone. Overall I unfortunately would not dine her again."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here twice in the past three days. Once for dinner and once for breakfast. The service and food is excellent. Big portions for a great price. This area of Huntersville, NC needed a diner like this!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the second time and it was delicious. The first time i went i had chicken and waffles and they were awesome. The second time i went on the lighter side and ordered a chicken spinach salad with balsamic dressing and it was so good. I usually don't go crazy for salads but it was enough to fill me up and leave me happy. Adding chicken was the way to go"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, very consistent.  Plan to keep on going back.  Very good location near some of our favorite shopping areas.  Triple D is always a good reference for the type of dining we appreciate."}
{"text":"I had a great time at brunch. Been here a few times before to get their yummy banana cream pie. This time we had the Spicy Honey Chicken Biscuit, the Metro Pancake, and the Fried Chicken & Waffle. Their fried chicken is honestly the best thing I've had here. It's perfectly crispy and mouthwatering both in the fried chicken and waffle and with the spicy chicken biscuit. I've had better biscuits and waffle elsewhere, but still pretty good. The strawberry sauce that comes with the waffle really compliments the whole dish. When it comes to the pancake, I was impressed by fluffiness and the size of it. If you're craving a big fluffy pancake, this is the place to go. This is a great local place to go if you're craving a hearty American breakfast."}
{"text":"Outstanding, fast service and delicious food. Our waitress was so nice explained all the specials. We were greeted when arrived and we were walked out asking how everything was. They do not miss a beat here. They are on their game."}
{"text":"Big Bern's fried pork sandwich.... Umm all i can say is WHOA! That sandwhich is tasty!!!! Fried pork was perfectly cooked bacon was crispy and spinach and onions were a super compliment to the sandwhich. Like \"Guy\" says... Thats a one way ticket to flavor town! LOL  Thats what i had and my mom had the Philly cheese steak and she said that was tasty as well. The service was great our server \"Nick\" i believe it was .. he was polite and was there to answer questions we had. I like diners.. i like the fact there is a variety of food to choose from especially when your with people who have diffrent tastes. And Metro did not disappoint ... We'll be back to try everything else!!! Looking forward to the next time!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best restaurants I have eaten at in a long time. This is such a Midwest feel place in a city where a little friendliness is sometimes hard to find. Every person who works here is happy and polite, very refreshing. The food is a amazing and I can't wait to come back! Yummmm! Ask for Chelsea, she was a wonderful waitress!"}
{"text":"The staff seemed new when we experienced brunch here. They were nice, but seemed confused every time we asked a question. We were expecting the same menu as the Metro Diner in Fayetteville, but it's not exactly the same. Maybe each location has a different specialty. We were a bit disappointed also because the dishes we ordered wasn't as tasty as we'd expected.  Hopefully it will get better because everything we ordered at the Fayetteville location was amazing. We ordered 8 different dishes and they were ALL delicious!"}
{"text":"It was ok, wasn't anything special. Homemade corned beef hash was good, not outstanding. Wife got biscuits and gravy, was good. Very expensive for breakfast! I will give it another chance, if I have extra money"}
{"text":"Knowledgeable wait staff, but the breakfast...yuk...actually the biscuits and gravy looked like cat vomit and could have been used to hang wall paper. Don't know if the wait staff talks to the kitchen, but when I told the server that my gooey B&G tasted like flour, he retorted that he just takes order and delivers the food.  OKAY then..."}
{"text":"First visit here. If quantity was a factor I'd give it 5 stars. The portions are large. The food was good, but overly greasy. The food is OK but does not cause me to want me to return."}
{"text":"So I usually go to the location on Tropicana but this Stephanie location is much closer to home. I was greeted with kindness n seated promptly. They had a decent crowd already  there because duh the foods amazing! Idk if I can say the same for the staff there. Me n my daughter waited for 15 min for our waitress to come to the table. Her name was supposed to be Nina or somethin. I'm never met her. While I waited a waitress by the name of Ida asked if we've been helped. I told her no so she took our drink orders and said she'll have Nina come over to us. No Nina. Ida returned back and said no worries, I'll take your order and she also apologized for the wait. Wow. It wasn't even her fault. 2 different staff members brought us our food which was incorrect but I got more food than I was supposed to. As long as I wasn't charged. The lady placing the food in front of us told me to hurry up and grab my plate cause it's hot. HURRY UP???!  Well bitch ur a waitress wear a damn waitress sleeve. U can make them out of a sock! I eventually grabbed the plate but I was hesitant because it wasn't correct. Smh.. anyway I guess she tried to argue with me. Big no no. I just wanted to make sure i didn't have someone else's order from another table n i wanted butter not an argument. The manager is nice.. he walks around and ask how you doin. It's hard to pay before your food you might be interrupted by a rude waitress. I will return only because I want to be seated in Ida' s section.  She's a hustler a go getter n a hard worker! Corned beef hash was nasty af btw."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffle portion is great but the chicken is VERY SALTY. Dario by the way is awesome in his service."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late breakfast on a Monday during spring break. I'd have to say it was a near perfect if not perfect experience. We had quick and friendly service. The food was delicious and the portions were generous. The prices were very reasonable considering all of this. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is greater and plenty of it, anyone l I keep Monte Cristo sandwich, theirs is great. Friendly staff and nice decor."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday evening for dinner. Didn't even know this place existed, but wow am I glad we found this place.  Service was awesome, Ryker the waiter was very attentive and friendly. Manager stopped by to see how we liked everything. food was quick and excellent. The chicken pot pie was great! Get the large for $1 more u will eat it all.   Great deserts too."}
{"text":"We came in 7:20pm,we didn't pay attention and nobody told us that they were closing in 40 mins.so after 20 mins,the waitress gave us the bill right after they brought all the food.lol,really?also the fried chicken with waffle was so nasty.wouldnt come back no more."}
{"text":"Have wanted to try this place for awhile now and we finally went and it was great!  It's in a decent strip mall and the spot use to be the seafood restaurant Pier 51 for those that remember.   Place was pretty hopping for a Sunday night which is a good sign.   Service was great (5/5) and the interior was fine as was the seating (5/5).  They have a drink spot where you can go and refill your beverage or coffee which was convenient but our waitress refilled our drinks for us.   I ordered the Monte cristo and it was pretty good but I don't know who could finish it;  I could only eat one section and my side of grits and had 3 leftover!  But it was tasty.  The grits were just ok howver. Wife had the club and she really enjoyed it.  Overall I'd say food was very good (5/5) We'll definitely come back and try other items from the extensive menu."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service.  Very friendly staff!  Reasonably priced. Lived that they offer breakfast lunch and dinner at anytime of the day."}
{"text":"As soon as Father and I walked in, the mouth watering aroma of fresh Belgium waffles entered our nostrils along with a friendly greeting from the hostess. We were seated immediately in a comfortable booth that had plenty of room for our bellys. Our waitress was very kind and taught us everything we needed to know about the menu, including the local favorites and freshly brewed raspberry tea, which was refreshing yet satisfying. I had ordered the Huevos Rancheros and Father ordered the chicken and waffles, which he had never had before and was quite frightened to try. Our meals were placed before us within 10 minutes. Father was intimidated, but I knew he was no longer frightened as he tackled the chicken with their sweet n' spicy syrup. My huevos rancheros were good, but not like the original, which I was warned about by our lovely waitress prior. I did not listen. Father was impressed and wondered why he had not tried chicken and waffles before, but I reassured him that is over now. As we finished our stay at the Metro Diner, Father and I discussed how we would definitely make our way back and savor another menu item someday again."}
{"text":"Amazing chocolate chip pancakes! I'm insanely picky about restaurant pancakes and theirs are definitely my new favorite! We also got the spicy honey chicken biscuit, which was very good as well. Our server was extremely polite and attentive. We will certainly be back again!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and yelped places to eat and saw the Metro Diner was close by with a four and a half star rating. We were greeted by a very friendly Hostess and also by a very friendly waitress. Nice comfortable diner. The place was busy at lunchtime  The waitress asked if we knew about the beverage bar and she explained that you go up to the bar yourself and help yourself to coffee , tea , soft drinks, etc. Plus one can take out  a beverage to go.  The cost is $  2.49 per person but does not include fruit juices or white or chocolate? milk. To me this is a great idea,  the waitress doesn't have to run back with a coffee pot and ask if you want to refill or run back and forth to refill  a soda etc.  The menu had a large variety of breakfast choices, pancakes ,waffles omelets, egg dishes,  many  breakfast sides a plus lunchtime/ dinner menus featuring comfort foods and lunch/ dinner sides , plus daily board specials . One can order anything on the menu anytime of the day.  Across from our booth the diners ate the peach pancake special and waffles with fruit,  so it must have been good  as they polished their plates clean.  We decided to have lunch  so we ordered the broccoli cheddar cheese soup,  my dining mate ordered the Southwest wrap and I ordered their chicken salad atop a garden salad with blue cheese dressing on the side.  We both agreed the soup was very delicious, loaded with broccoli and cheese and came out hot. My dining mate really enjoyed the Southwest wrap special.  I had a taste and agreed it was excellent, loaded with tasty chicken,  black beans, veges etc.  He didn't particularly care for the side he ordered,  homemade potato chips as they were extremely hard and crunchy to his taste. The chicken salad  which was described as loaded with grapes ,celery,  and pecans ,was not  , although it was tasty it was a bit on the salty side to my taste. Unfortunately the blue cheese salad dressing I ask for ,  I did not care for, one of the worst I tasted.  It was extremely salty and didn't taste from blue cheese at all.  I had my dining mate taste it and he agreed that it was overly salty .  So some food tasted great, others did not. Food was plated nicely. Good portion size,  menu prices moderate with many  menu choices plus a kid's menu. Service we experienced was great. We would certainly come back again and try something different from the menu.    ."}
{"text":"Was pleasently surprised what a nice place this was! Didn't have to wait for table,waitress was super nice,food was good & decent prices. Would cone again!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service with lots of smiles all around. Husband and I stopped in for Saturday brunch. Portions are huge but awesome for the cost value. Food came out steaming hot and exactly the way we were hoping. Hubby had the party melt and I-rings. Tasted really good. I had the biscuit and gravy biscuit breakfast and while I couldn't finish it, would have if I had a spare stomach. Their self service drink bar is a fresh concept and helps to keep the servers focused on getting the food out to the tables faster."}
{"text":"A niche filled for the Matthews area.  Comfort food done reasonably well and not Dilworth priced. All the Classic Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner fare you'd expect.  Decent service and good presentation"}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat. Always has amazing food and amazing service. I go any chance I get. I've become a regular. It's a little pricey for what they serve but you can tell it's a good quality of food. Breakfast is served all day as well."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this spot for months! After seeing them featured on Diners Drive ins and Dives I've been salivating at the sheer thought of my arrival. So I finally made it there last weekend, cute spot has a cozy authentic diner feel. I wish the lighting in there was better though, I had a really hard time reading the menu. Our Server seemed very knowledgeable about the items and was able to make a few suggestions. I went with the spicy honey chicken biscuit and cheesy grits. My husband had pancakes and Turkey sausage, he was definitely pleased with the quality of both and even said their coffee was decent. My breakfast sandwich was ok....what made it for me was their buttery biscuit, the best I've ever had... I could do without the chicken however. The strawberry butter tasted artificial I'm not a fan. The cheesy grits were an epic fail, I'm a grits gal, and they totally messed up my grits. Too watery, and had too much black pepper. It was not good. Our waiter then started to drift off and was no longer attentive to our needs, he had the label Trainer on the back of his shirt but seemed to be gossiping with his coworkers instead of actually training smh...you would think if the customer mentions the only reason why they came in was because they seen it on Drive Ins Diners and Dives, it should be clear indication they would be writing a review about their experience after the fact , so wouldn't you want to be on your Ps n Qs? Maybe its just me"}
{"text":"What a good decision! I was only in town for the day and it was around lunch time ish so I looked a brunch place and this is what popped up for me. It was easy to find and well put together. I really wanted to try the chicken and waffles but, my figure told me otherwise, so I went for the corned beef with red potatoes and pouched eggs, an order of turkey sausage on the side. (Lots of of protein here) I drizzled both eggs over the corned beef with some salt and pepper and dove it in. Never had pouched eggs but they were fantastic with the corned beef. It didn't get cover everything so the next time I will have four eggs instead of two. A glass of sweet tea to wash it all down; that had me fat and happy for the rest of the day. This meal wasn't too heavy at all. I made a three hour drive after this and wasn't even close to being sleepy. Don't know if it was all the protein or the portion size was just right. However, it was good eats!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! My favorite diner so far. The servers are nice (especially Ricker, hope I spelled that right) and you don't have to wait until you flag a server down to get you a refill you can get it yourself at the self serve station which is very clean. The food is amazing!! I suggest you leave your diet at home but it tastes fresh and like home cooking. The chicken and waffle with homemade strawberry butter is delicious if you need somewhere to start!"}
{"text":"Great food, not greasy. Friendly and wholesome. Wide variety of choices for this Southern Style Diner."}
{"text":"I had heard and read so many good things about Metro diner.  Couldn't wait to try.  Overall the experience was ok.  We came in for lunch and really had a hard time deciding what to get.    Food - We settled on the Chicken Salad sandwich and French Dip.  Let me first say the portions were pretty big.  The Chicken Salad sandwich was good.  Had the onion rings with it and they had reallly good flavor.  I chose the French Dip.  Again the portions were good and the French Dip had good flavor.    Service - Service was one of the best parts of our visit.  Our server was very personable and provided a lot of insight on the offerings.    Atmosphere - Typical diner layout.  I liked the open kitchen. So you could see what they are doing.     I would like to try some of the other dishes.  Would return and give it another try."}
{"text":"When i walked in I knew I was in for a treat. The restaurant was crowded but we were seated immediately at the bar. I got to see firsthand all the delicious food being prepared. The employees take great pride in preparing the food. You can taste it in every bite. I hate we don't have anything like this in Columbia. We will return soon the crossaint french toast is calling my name"}
{"text":"I was very excited to attend the diner as I heard several great things. I order the chicken pot pie and my husband the fried chicken platter. Overall our experience may have been disappointing due to us arriving an hour before close. My husband sides seem as though they sat all day and my pot pie filling as well. The chicken tasted as though it was fried in burnt oil.   My husband got sick the next day but that may be a coincidence.  I was really hoping for the best with the reputation they had.  Waitress was polite and friendly."}
{"text":"In from out of town and decided to stop by for breakfast. Really good omlet, traditional hasbrowns and delicious biscuit. Sat at the counter and watched them make my breakfast . Friendly people and good service. Nice spot for breakfast"}
{"text":"One their specials is Chicken Fried steak.  It was not a special on 9/15/17 and I asked my server Darla if I could get it anyway.  The manager said yes!.  It was fantastic. great gravy too!.  My service was excellent and the Mango tea was awesome. However there was no Mango coffee (joke between Darla and me) .  I love that they come from a place of yes for their customers.  And the check process was fast and convenient."}
{"text":"New to Charlotte, I had never heard of Metro Diner. It had a cool neon sign so we figured we would give it a whirl.   The menu is overwhelming but in a good way. So many choices that it was tough to narrow it down. Our waitress let us know of the specials that day and we both (without sharing) decided on the Chicken Alfredo and garlic bread. It was exceptional. Portions were large!   Our service was great as my drink was never empty. They even took our order with an iPad which sent it directly to the kitchen. I like those fancy gizmos and doodads if it means my food comes out quicker!  We will definitely return and next time try the chicken and waffles with strawberry butter! Yum!"}
{"text":"Good food. Crappy service.  Every time.    First Visit:  Stopped in on good recommendations from others, but doubt we will be back.   Breakfast with my wife and kiddo. Greek omelette was ok but lacking in filling, hardly any feta.  Kiddo's pancakes were nothing special.   Chicken and waffles were very tasty, especially the light and fluffy waffles. For some reason the food took forever to come out of the kitchen and then only half the chicken, with the last piece being delivered after we were most of the way through the meal.  Making hungry kids wait for food is not a way to get repeat customers.  Waitress was nothing special, never refilled our drinks or even stop by to check on us while we waited extra long for the food to appear with no explanation or apologies.  Second visit: as bad as the first.  Once again the chicken and  waffles were great, and the shrimp and grits were very tasty though I needed a bit more grit cakes to go with the gravy.  The common issue here was the server. She had a party to take care of and no attention paid during the meal.  She dropped the bill and we waited 20 min for her not to come back.  When we asked the hostess to send her over, still no server.  Finally my wife threatened to walk out on the bill and someone else was able to run our card.  Worst service ever.    Consistently crappy service seems to be the same story I gather from just about everyone.   The staff at various stores in the plaza have said it, as well as multiple friends and acquaintances we have talked to.  Surprised at the high star rating in Yelp."}
{"text":"Much better today than a few months ago when they got my order wrong and the service was slow. Fast service and good food today .  The only hiccup was a dirty spoon.  I can't stand dirty utensils and when they bring a new one, I always want to wipe it off.  Metro Diner was super busy today. It is definitely a popular place and I do understand why.  The servers were running around the restaurant like crazy.  They were all extremely nice and accommodating.   I will return."}
{"text":"So good, we are going back for dinner! We are from out of town, and heard about this place! My daughter and I went in for brunch, and the entire staff was kind and accommodating! Children welcome! Beyond that, the food is many notches above typical diner fare. Delicious, homemade, fresh and cooked to order. They said, if you can dream it, we can make it, but the special was just fine with me! I couldn't even finish! Go, go, go!!!"}
{"text":"We received a coupon for $10 off an order for Metro diner. We called ahead to order for pick up and they were very accommodating in letting us use the coupon without having to stay. We ordered the chicken and waffles and also the stuffed French toast. At the end of the call we were not given a total, but I assumed it wouldn't be more than $20, there is no way, right? When we got there to pick up the order, the diner seemed very busy. Everyone was very kind, said hello, and whatnot. We gave her the coupon and she said \"OK, this coupon brings your total to $32\". I think my husband almost died lol. I myself thought I miss heard her. No it was true, it was $32 with tax including $10 off for two entr√©es that did not come with any sides such as hashbrowns, eggs, bacon, etc. I was hoping and praying that this food would be so delicious that we would both forget how much we just spent on breakfast. The chicken that comes with the chicken and waffles were huge pieces, the coating was very tasty, but the chicken also came with bones. It was as if they took a whole chicken, added a meat cleaver to the situation, and cleaved the chicken into four pieces. The waffle was a regular sized tasty waffle, but have you ever tasted a gross waffle? The sweet and spicy syrup that comes with the chicken and waffles was very good! Now for the stuffed French toast, which has a really weird name that I can't remember, where do I begin? The French toast pieces itself where OK. The filling of bananas and cream cheese was OK at first, but got to be way too much very quickly. I totally forgot I had the blueberry strawberry compote which is a good thing because it would've been complete overload if I had remembered it. It came with a total of one slice cut in half, but it was stuffed. Maybe it wouldn't been too much sweetness if we had a piece of sausage or some hashbrowns to eat with it I don't know... We have eating there one time before and had ordered the poundcake French toast and the monte cristo. The fried pound cake was  tasty, but also very expensive for just getting the fried pieces of poundcake (Sara Lee brand, bought in a bag NOT made on site). My husband is the one who ordered the Montecristo being that he had loved it from a different place a while ago we took maybe a bite each and couldn't eat it because it was so plain. We wanted to like it so much but the prices are just insane and to scale with strip prices. My husband and I do not go to the strip for that very reason and therefore we will not be returning to Metro Diner. Like I said before, the staff is very nice and informative- nothing against the staff."}
{"text":"The food was great here, unfortunately the ceiling had leaked water on my left over food though. The waitress ended up not charging me anything even though I said it wasn't an issue. They definitely look out for you. I ended up coming back 2 days later for more food."}
{"text":"We have found a new restaurant.  Excellent chicken and waffles are to die for!  James took great care of us"}
{"text":"I have been to the Matthews, Pineville and this location. I have to say, that you won't notice the difference. The quality of the food and superb service is consistent throughout these locations. I was introduced to Metro Diner through a Yelp event and boy-oh-boy have I fell in love with it. Having lived in NY for over a decade, I did miss a \"classic\" diner place. These place and it's homestyle cooking is the closest to a NY local diner you can get around here. Every time I have guests staying with me, I take them here at least once. BRUNCH is a must here!  Getting more and more into southern cuisine the CHICKEN AND WAFFLES is a must! It's my fave here actually. Their crispy chicken is so tender and juicy, I can't believe how they can achieve such heavenly goodness. Their strawberry butter and special hot-sauce syrup is the perfect garnish to this dish. Their belgian waffles remind me of my childhood in Germany! YUUUUUUUUM.  Dishes I recommend here too are the Holy Davoli (two grilled cheese bacon sandwiches hugging a burger patty! and the shrimp and grit cakes.  Their house coffee is good as well as their Bloody Mary.   I haven't explored the menu further, because yes.......I always get the same dish because it's amazeballs!  Each location has a private parking lot. Come here, leave with happy bellies."}
{"text":"Very good. Nice selection of breakfast, lunch and dinner options. Prices are ok, service was quick and friendly. Portions were generous and tasty!"}
{"text":"Would be 5 stars, because the food and service was amazing, but the use of Styrofoam is just too much to handle. Switch to a more eco-friendly to-go option and you would have my 5 star rating."}
{"text":"The service is great! The food comes out fast, hot and delicious. Haven't had something here that I didn't like. Chicken and waffles, steak salad, Monte Cristo, Biscuits and gravy, chilaquiles..  Bon app√©tit!"}

Metro Diner, Henderson, NV -Stephanie Road will be added to my favorite list.  A friendly welcome relief of delicious food and drink, for a solo business traveler seeking comfort.  Plus a great slow atmosphere before speeding into the rest of your day.  Interior photos to be added later. A very unassuming exterior, with delicious delightful food inside.  Similar to the warm and friendly feeling, I've always experienced in Southern USA. (Southern Cuisine)  Something for every palate: Organic choice teas, No-Carb option (egg & turkey sausage), crab egg hollandaise, to sinfully tasty looking waffles & pink ice cream. (didn't try-looked absolutely delicious).  Diner service from host/hostess, waitress, visiting regional manager, and the amazing COOK was phenomenal.  Just what the doctor ordered after the awful tasteless, and high priced Westin Lake Las Vegas.NV buffet breakfast the morning before.  A new customer for LIFE.  Can't wait to bring my husband here for good eats.  Much appreciation!  Metro Diner, Henderson.NV Stephanie Rd."}
{"text":"Best Reuben I have ever tasted! Food was great and our server, Patience, was amazing! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fast service! Food serving was large for one person to finish. The Monte Cristo was delicious! Also had the Pittsburgh Steak Salad, the fries  were perfect! Would definitely recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across Metro Diner on an episode of Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and decided to check it out because it combines two of our food loves: diners and breakfast.  As the 3 stars indicate it was A-Ok, but probably not worth the 27 mile drive from my house.  However, I will be the first to admit that we got sidetracked by the Specials board from our original plan of ordering the Monte Cristo and Chicken & Waffle.  Always trust your first instinct, people!    We arrived around 10 AM on Mother's Day and were pleasantly surprised that there was no wait.  It was a beautiful morning, so we took advantage of the patio seating.    John picked the Benedict Florentine ($10.99) from Specials board and was not impressed.  He didn't care for the hollandaise sauce and felt that the eggs were over cooked.     I ordered a Western Omelette ($10.99)- ham, cheddar, onions, tomatoes, and peppers. (86'ed the mushrooms).  It's topped with salsa, which seemed like Pace picante sauce to me.  To be honest, I'm not sure that it enhanced the omelette and would recommend getting it on the side before committing.  I ordered fruit as my side ($.50 up charge) and it was perfect.  Our service was very good, although we found it odd that our server Marylu had to step away a couple of times to answer a cordless phone to take carryout orders.  Quite the multi-tasker!  We also really liked that they bring a tablet to your table to pay your bill so you don't have to hand your credit card over.    I've heard that Eastern/Serene and Stephanie/215 locations are planned, so I think we'll wait until one of those locations opens to try some of the menu items that seem to get a lot of Yelp love."}
{"text":"I'm going to go with just okay for the Stephanie location of Metro Diner.  I vacillated between 2 and 3 stars, but I'm feeling generous.  I gave the W. Trop. location 3 stars as well, but I actually liked that set-up and service there better.    This location was very busy when we stopped by for dinner, so we sat at the counter to avoid the 45-60 minute wait.  Their counter seating is small and a little odd.  It's right next to the expediter, so we got a firsthand look at why they were so backed up.  He seemed truly lost and didn't want to listen to any of his servers who seemed to know more than he did.  I didn't like how rude he was to them.  The kitchen staff was very nice though.  They actually asked us a couple times what we had ordered because they could see how long we were waiting (over 35 minutes) for our food.  I ordered the Chicken Salad on a salad ($10.49).  It was filling, nothing special, but no complaints on flavor.  Everything was premade, so it should have taken less than 5 minutes to come out.  John got the Meatloaf Plate ($12.99 + $3.99) He asked if he could sub a garden salad for the potatoes and baguette.  The waitress said sure, but didn't mention that it would cost more.  It would have been nice to be told in advance that this was a $4 up charge.  Not a lot of money, but it's kind of crappy to add a charge without notice, especially since a garden salad is only 50 cents more than a side of mashed potatoes.    Our waitress was nowhere to be found for the majority of our visit.  I asked the hostess if we had one after about 10 minutes.  A server came over and took our order, but that's the last time we saw her.  We never got iced tea refills and the kitchen staff just handed us our plates over the counter (which we appreciated).  I had to ask the expediter for a copy of our bill so we could pay and leave.  Maybe we'll try again  in a couple months since the location is perfect for us."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant so much. The staff is incredible, always smiling. The price is very good. They do a good job of making tables ready even at their busiest so even when there is a line out the door, no need to worry. There are a few items on the menu I personally did not like, but they more than make up for it in the items I do like. Such as their shrimp and grits, the chicken and waffles.  My biggest complaint is the fact they only have two single restrooms. It sucks at times seeing a line for the restroom. But, it's very clean every time I've been there so I'll survive. So glad I discovered metro diner."}
{"text":"Each visit is better than the last. The chicken and waffles are a winner. The Crab Benedict Florentine was better than I expected. This will remain my go to Saturday brunch spot. $2 $2 $2 $2 $2"}
{"text":"While our pickup was being serviced over on Gibson, my wife and I went to Metro for breakfast.  She had the chicken and waffles and I had an omelette special (bacon, cheese and mushrooms.  I particularly liked the options on the hash browns and I had the onions which were almost a plentiful as the potatoes.  The chicken and waffles were quite good.  However, my wife stripped off the breading on the chicken and did not use the strawberry topping for the waffles.  I ate some of the breading (quite good!) and had the strawberry topping on my toast (also quite good).  Coffee was decent and they have Dickinson jellies (a plus). However, the best part of the meal was Jennifer, our server, who treated my wife like an old friend.  I was in the restaurant business for more than a few years and I wish I could have staffed my entire restaurant with Jennifer's.  In closing, I know this is a chain, but it seemed more like a one of a kind experience.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"All I can say is that, this is our favorite \"Go-to\" breakfast place. The fried chicken and waffles are kind of addicting. Service is always on point even on their busy days. Metro Diner South Rainbow keep up the great vibes and food!!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to eat here based on the Yelp reviews. I do have to say the staff here was incredibly friendly. Honestly, they go above and beyond here which is a nice treat. I was super excited to eat here based on the reviews but the best I can give this restaurant is a 3. I ordered the huevos rancheros which came with chorizo and fried jalapenos. I had to salt pepper and add much hot sauce to give this any flavor at all. I'm going to give it at 3 because it wasn't bad it just wasn't good. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and enjoyed her dinner much more than I enjoyed mine. She rated hers a 4."}
{"text":"I dined tonight with a group of Elite Yelp member tonight. Pretty cool event for my first time attending one after being Elite for a year.  I sampled many entrees.  The Huevos Rancheros was pretty good but I omit the egg or have it scrambled.  The fried jalape√±o wasn't hot which was good.  The croissant French toast was tasty.  I had my first chicken n waffles tonight.  The strawberry butter sauce was a favorite for everyone.  The chicken was hot and crispy (not salty at all).  The andouille sausage in Charleston shrimp and grits brought out the flavor.  Otherwise it would have been quite bland.  The meatloaf was quite interesting as it consisted of many types of meats in one.  The vegetable mix and mash potatoes was a nice addition.  The Holy Devoli burger was stacked and perfect for a cheese lover.  This is a good restaurant as it has a variety of choices so patrons can come back to try something different every time and establish favorites.  The service was the upmost attentive, food was warm, good presentation.  I would expect everything to be the same as a patron.  I feel they were sincere regardless of the type of occasion."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some feel good comfort food, check out Metro Diner. We came at a really good time, it was about 4pm, and no waiting, sat promptly and drink orders were taken right away, even before meeting out server. The staff there were very friendly and everybody seemed to get along well. Our server, Dario, was friendly and very knowledgeable with all the specials of the day. I saw an order of chicken and waffles that was ginormous so I knew right then what I was getting. My friend Karen wasn't as sure since everything on the menu looked delicious!  Dario was very patient and helpful as he helped her navigate the menu. She finally settled on the blackened chicken tenders but was really feeling the meatloaf. What was making her apprehensive was the meatloaf had mushrooms which, she's not a fan of the fungus but Dario assured her she wouldn't taste it because of how it was prepared. So we compromised and order a slice ala carte for 2.50. So glad we did because we both thought it was amazing! Now back to my chicken and waffles. The chicken was juicy and fried to perfection. The waffles with the strawberry butter that had real strawberry pieces in the butter and powder sugar complimented the waffles perfectly. Then of course to really enjoy the chicken and waffles, Dario made this syrup/hotsauce combo that was great for dipping, don't let the hotsauce/syrup scare you,it went well with the chicken and waffles. We definitely will come back and hopefully Dario is working because he made our dining experience very enjoyable."}
{"text":"FINALLY after attempting for the past couple Sundays to get into this place... We scored on a Saturday! The customer service was wonderful, the smells was making me even more hungry, the portions you get are HUGE!!! My husband got the fried chicken & waffles, juicy chicken with like a strawberry butter or something. The waffles were big & fluffy. Just done right perfect! I got the shrimp & grits (they'll ask if you'd like traditional or how they make it) I got the non-traditional... I ate & ate until I couldn't breath! Of my the squares of breaded grits were out of this world. We definitely were not disappointed what so ever!!! No wonder Sunday's are busy. Oh I was lucky to get to watch all the food that was coming out & there's lots I want to try. Looked oh so yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Very very good Sunday breakfast spot! Good portion sizes, and very well made food. Parking is tight! And there's a wait once you check in. I wish I'd found this place sooner. Will come back"}
{"text":"The Comfort Food train has rolled into town! If you're looking for authentic Monte Christo sandwiches, shrimp and grits, biscuits and gravy. Mac and cheese and the best chicken and waffles in town...this is the place! Everything on the menu is yummy. Service and staff is exceptional. They have two more locations coming this year. Check them out."}
{"text":"Great food, breakfast, lunch and dinner all day! Great portion sizes! Good family restaurant that's not too pretensions with a 50s diner feel. Great value for the portions. Consider splitting your entree order...."}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  Fast service.  Good comfort food and specials.  Would recommend for breakfast.  Plan on coming back to try it out for dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Metro Diner last night. Service was amazing! Latrice (the manager) came by and checked on us. I had the pot roast, so delicious! My husband had huveos rancheros and he loved it. We will be back again! Great food and great service! Thank you Metro Diner we will be back."}
{"text":"This is actually a pretty good restaurant spot with many options,  the food looks fresh,  I've only ever had the fried chicken and waffle dish,  and my gf got a dish to but i can't remember the name.  She was dissatisfied with her hashbrowns (were burnt) she asked for no cheese on an omelette and they charged extra for the substitute. that little bit sucked. Also, it's a bit pricey,  but you get a butt-load of food. Will come back when the lady and I can splurge a bit"}
{"text":"Delicious. Ordered the Charleston Shrimp and grits and an iced tea. Service was good, food came out quick. Highly recommended, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Metro Diner is a great, clean place to eat breakfast, lunch or dinner at. With a wide variety of food to choose from you can order breakfast throughout the whole day. Personally, I tried the Cajun chicken pasta and had a huge portion size. The pasta had some spice to it but not extremely hot and had excellent flavor. I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"First time here for me with my boyfriend. He's been here before. I live right down the street & I've been wanting to try it but haven't had a chance until now. I looked up reviews & ordered some of the stuff that was recommended. Let me start with I would've given more stars if I could've actually enjoyed the other half of my food. I ordered the biscuits & gravy with a side of sausage patties which came with eggs & home fries. They dropped off my food & my gravy was almost cold & being that it was house made gravy I expected it to taste better than that. The server was really nice  & took it back for new one. A man that looked like a manager brought it back out nice & hot , but the gravy just wasn't that good. The sausage patties that cost about 5 bucks for 2 pieces tasted like it was cooked yesterday or something? Not good either. The home fry potatoes on the side tasted like they fry a bunch of it & have it under a lamp or something & throw them on a plate per order. I think I just made a bad decision on my order.   Ok...what made me still want to come back & maybe try other items on the menu is the nice staff & the CHICKEN & WAFFLES! I never thought I'd like it cause I didn't like the whole concept of chicken dipped in syrup, but throw some Louisiana hot sauce in the syrup & it was so good. Sweet, savory,salty, with a lil kick. The waffles came with their house made strawberry butter which was delicious. I didn't even use the syrup with the waffles. The strawberry butter was enough. A must try item for sure.   We'll be back some day to try something else on the menu but definitely not the biscuits & gravy."}
{"text":"Metro Diner had been on my hit list for a while.   Finally made it this week and found the menu overwhelming. So many choices, so little time.   Liz, was our \"cruise director\" (waitress) and the journey left us wanting more. Comfortable environment, quality ingredients with biscuits and gravy that will leave you begging for more!  A definite breakfast \"do over\" - now to sample lunch and dinner too.  Started in Jacksonville in 1992, glad that you've come to CLT."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the service was very poor. Staff was not friendly or polite even after countless delays and mistakes."}
{"text":"Huntersville finally has a diner ! And it is pretty good as well.   Because this place is new, a lot of people are coming to try it out. There will be a wait but it is worth it. The food is really good, it is actually better than what I was expecting and the staff is really nice and helpful. The menu choices are extensive, as you expect in a diner and the prices are pretty reasonable.   The great feature about the diner is that you can make your payment at the table with the server iPad. This is called efficiency and it is here!  We'll be back to try the breakfast choices, but this place really deserves 4 stars for now."}
{"text":"We came into diner, ask to be seated at our Favorite servers (Bernie) table and Sha was at hostess stand. Never before have we been treated like we were a big inconvenience! She (SHA) said w/ a \" huff and mean dimeaner\" - there are no tables, we'll have to clean one.. I then reaplied to the Mgr., \" I guess that means yes\". He was quick to say \" we'll have that for you in just a minute\".   We've never ever had bad service or bad food here, the \"1 * is for Sha."}
{"text":"Went on mothers day,  food was great,  service was amazing.  How this place stays around"}
{"text":"We LOVE Metro Diner! Food is fantastic as is the service!  Worth the drive EVERYTIME!!!"}
{"text":"Brand new restaurant.  Just opened today (11/7/17).  Very busy for lunch.    Typical \"diner\" menu where you can get breakfast all day long.  Their \"signature\" dish is Chicken and Waffles.  Haven't had it yet but it LOOKED delicious.  I did have the Mushroom Bacon Swiss burger and it was VERY GOOD.    Corporate was still there so they are still in \"training\".  Hope they can keep up the good work.  Check it out, when you get the chance."}
{"text":"This is a great place for some great food if you don't know which cuisines you want to choose at that moment. We tried several items from the menu, breakfast and dinner. All very good! We will come back soon..."}
{"text":"A Metro Diner..I had heard a lot about the Monte Cristo sandwich that they had served at one of the other locations. So we came looking for that treat but it has been taken off the menu. I wish they would put it back on because it seems like most everything they make at this location is really good. We had a fairly large group but they accommodated us very quickly.  I was sad to see that the Monte Cristo was gone but I ordered the Chicken and Waffles which was really good. It was crisply fried chicken and nice big waffles and lots of spicy syrup and some strawberry butter. I ordered hashbrowns on the side and they were terrific! My husband had the Bacon Mushroom Swiss burger and it was a good juicy burger also. I ordered the Peach Unsweetened Tea. It was a nice clean diner to eat in. I would go back and would love it if they added that Monte Cristo back on the menu that I heard so much about !"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late breakfast with my husband at Metro Diner today. It was our first time in and we were very happy with both the food and the service.   Not only did they have plenty of staff for a busy Sunday late morning, but every staff member from the hostess to the waitress to the managers were nothing but welcoming and pleasant!   I got the Spicy Honey Chicken Biscuit with a side of Home Fries and is may be the best breakfast I've had in a long time in Vegas. My husband ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side of grits and even after 15 minutes (he saves his grits for last!) they were steaming hot!   GO TRY THIS PLACE!! You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"One star is a gift! And that is only because the portion sizes were decent  & the sandwiches were tasty.  The downside is I paid $9 for a BLT and over $8 for chicken salad. Our server Rachel basically nonexistent. Like other reviews , we also were not provided napkins . We waited over 20 minutes for the sandwiches (kitchen's fault) . We saw Rachel socializing with the staff for a while as we waited for her to return to our table with to go boxes & to retrieve our payment.  This was our first time and unfortunately will not return, not worth the overpriced food and poor service. We will drive out of our way to continue to patronize our favorite diner on Central Avenue (Landmark Diner) where the food is amazing, prices are better the portions are larger and the service is outstanding."}
{"text":"There's not much to complain about at this place. It is definitely above average for diner food. Both their all day breakfast items and lunch items are tip top. Their burgers are huge and much better quality than what you would find at typical diners. They have a lot of options on their menu and all their food taste made from scratch. The pot pie is excellent. Service was decent and got in and out fast for lunch."}
{"text":"If there was a sub title to apply to this review it would be, A Random Stop Turns into Foodie Goodness.  And that is basically how it all unfolded.  Quick and friend hosts combined with the same style wait staff got us off to a great start.  While there is plenty of seating inside, we decided to eat outside.  Now don't go thinking you're going to get some beautiful or picturesque view.  It's a parking lot but like old dogs, I like people and car watching from the porch.  The food was damn good.  It really does deserve the damn point of reference.  I had the breakfast burger and the wife had some of the best chicken salad she's had anywhere outside of the home (she's still holding strong to her recipe).  I looked over the menu and didn't see a thing that didn't look appealing in some sort or fashion.  Parking? Reference the view for the point."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. The chicken and waffles will leave you staggering from the flavor and monstrous portion. The manager Rashad is attentive and professional. I recommend this place highly and will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Greeted immediately and kindly escorted to the table where my friend was waiting. The waiter brought our drinks and was very helpful in helping us decide what we'd order. I've had the pot roast before and a straight A, without a doubt but this time, I ordered the chicken salad. I was disappointed in that there were more pecans and apples than chicken. Hardly any chicken.  Will return but in no hurry."}
{"text":"Killed a burger and some huevos rancheros here! The burger was seasoned real nice and everyone was pretty nice. The host/ buser guy gave us a specials tour and he was hella cool. Our server Anna was also super dope, helped us out navigating the menu and had some pretty chill island vibes  The food came out lightning fast, and it was everything I expected and more. Cool diner to go too.   Overall, chill place or a good meal if you're hungry and want classic foods done right; this is the spot."}
{"text":"The steak salad with fries was delicious! Fried chicken was mediocre. Waffles were bomb! Eat fast or your food will get cold. Prices were a bit high but great staff! The servers have personality and accommodating."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!!! They just open, and it's a MUST TRY!!! Staff is friendly and food is tasty? Easy to find! They are in the Staple shopping center, and next to Mr. Tokyo. I will bring some friends with me next time!! Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Called ahead and there was still a wait. Small spot but cute retro diner inside. Menu items were exactly what you would expect from a diner. Nothing healthy at all, maybe the salads but I guess you come here really for some tasty hearty food. Ordered the chicken salad sandwich and got hash browns instead of French fries. Loved the hash browns, seriously I think it was the largest portion of hash browns I have ever seen before! Surprisingly I finished them all :-0 We also had the Chicken and waffles with the strawberry butter.  Chicken was a little too deep fried for my taste, maybe the oil was old and needed to be changed. The waffle was good and who knew strawberry butter could be so good. Nice waiters and decent prices. Will be back because I'm a sucker for a diner and hash browns."}
{"text":"Great food and great quick service.    The daily specials are always great.  The spicy chicken biscuit is great.  We also love that they started serving beer and wine."}
{"text":"This place!!! Got biscuits & gravy they where fantastic!!! The waitress Chelsey was super nice. I have heard the porkchops & gravy are the bees knees!!! The 50 style diner in side is a great touch. Definitely will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome diner! Ordered the chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes, pancake and eggs. Delicious. Hot. Excellent staff. Clean. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time on Friday, May 5th. Had the avocado sandwich with home fries. WOW!!! Talk about \"a burst of flavor\"!! So good! Sadly, I could only eat half. Took the other half home. Service was great. Got the food quick. Loved it! Returned the next day with the hubby. He ordered the same thing. He LOVED it! I ordered  the pancakes and eggs breakfast  (can't remember what it is called). Came with 2 large eggs, 2 sausage patties, home fries, toast, 2 large pancakes. Of course I couldn't finish it all. Took the pancakes home but we did taste them. YUMMY!  Overall, the staff is awesome and the food tastes so fresh and flavorful. We liked it so much, we plan on being regulars to the point the staff will recognize us and know our name. Who knows, maybe we'll get our very own booth/table! Lol!!!  If you haven't tried it, definitely go for breakfast  (which, by the way, is served all day!)."}
{"text":"Finally made it into the metro diner today for lunch. Tucked away in a strip mall, this place doesn't stick out like the NJ diners that are famous.  We walked in around 1245 and were told there would be a wait. The place wasn't packed, but there were tables that need cleaning I guess. When we say we were greeted by a lovely waitress.  I ordered the meatloaf plate and a pancake on the side. The food seemed carefully measured out to me. Portions weren't large at all for the price in my opinion, but it was good nonetheless.  My wife ordered the croissant French toast and said it was excellent.  My only criticism would be, that after the waitress asked if we needed coffee refills while we had almost full cups. She never asked us again. I even put my now empty cup at the edge of the table and nothing. But oh well.  Would we return? I believe so. The food was good and the location is central to were we do a lot of business."}
{"text":"My cat had an appointment for teeth cleaning and I wanted a place to stop for breakfast and have some coffee after dropping her off.  I had heard about Metro for awhile and I wanted to give it a try.  The place was almost empty, but it was 9 AM on a Monday and people were off to work.  I was seated where I could watch the door √† la Wild Bill Hickok.  The server asked me if I wanted coffee and then if I wanted their flavor of the day--hazelnut.  I opted for the hazelnut and it was just the right amount of flavoring--not overkill.  Since the specials board was above and behind my head, she told me what they were.  I ordered the meat lovers omelette--an omelette stuffed with bacon, sausage, and ham.  I ordered rye toast and plain grits.  In a short time, the breakfast arrived.  The server asked if I needed hot sauce or anything for the omelette but that was already in a holder on the table.  My coffee had already been refilled so the server was on the ball.  The only thing needed was some extra butter in the grits and a bit of salt on them.  The omelette was pretty standard and I liked the option of grits.  Service was very good but it should have been with the few people in the restaurant.  Easy parking and a varied menu for lunch and dinner make it a place I'll return."}
{"text":"Just came out to Metro Diner with my mom. We have been looking for a new place to have breakfast and lunch in the area. Latishua and Nick were so great making sure our food was delicous and fast to our table. They have flavored coffees and I wanted to try them but they didn't have any non-dairy creamer. Nick promised he would head over to publix and make sure he has some on hand for folks like me in the future. Great food. We will be back again. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent! I had Huevos Rancheros & wife had chicken & waffles. Both were incredible in portion & flavor! However 1 of the pcs of chicken came out slightly undercooked but they replaced the ENTIRE plate instead of just the 1pc. They even replaced the stuff that she already ate. And there was NO extra charge or anything. Very hospitable, friendly & all around atmosphere. Very clean also.   About time Las Vegas gets a good diner!!"}
{"text":"First time there yesterday and I was not disappointed! I ordered the spicy chicken biscuit w/home fries and grits, and it was delicious! We had two waitresses (I believe one was new to the job). Both ladies did great! Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"This Place was disappointing.  The breakfast fare was okay but not rocket science to make...same greasy spoon eggs and bacon you could find anywhere.  But the rest of the food was terrible I ordered a \"tomato soup\" It was legitimately a THICK, chunky tomato sauce not anything resembling soup. You had to chew it.  Refused to eat it and the (very nice) staff had no explanation as to why this was being served as \"soup\" Drove by today to see it has shut it doors.    Closed as soon as it opened and can't be surprised"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place since it's down the street from our house. Server (forget her name) was friendly, no major issues there.   I'm not a breakfast person, and the lunch and dinner items left very little for vegetarians. Basically, a grilled cheese or an avocado wrap. No option for a veggie patty or vegetable sandwich. I ordered the \"avocado wrap\" with the black beans on the side, with the side dish being \"steamed vegetables\". My guy ordered fried chicken and waffles.   The wrap came out mostly spinach, was missing the fried jalapenos, missing the chipotle ranch, and only had 2 small slices of avocado. Barely any cheese. The black beans that were originally supposed to go in the wrap, was brought to me in a 2 oz ramekin. I assumed the side of steamed vegetables would be an assortment of veggies, but was only zucchini and squash. They did taste good, just not what I expected. I asked our server about the missing ingredients in my wrap and she said she would get a manager. Took a while for said manager to come out. I didn't ask for her, the server just told her to come speak to us. Manager told me the wrap only comes with half an avocado for the entire thing (it's a sizable wrap), but she would put extra for me this time. Seriously? If the focus of the dish is avocado as advertised, there should be a decent amount. They must have really small avocados, based on what came out the first time. After some time, the manager brought me a new wrap (with double all the ingredients, which I didn't request, but was appreciated) and said my side of veggies would be out soon, but was forgotten. By this point, my guy was almost done eating so I had a few bites of the wrap and asked for a to go box. I gave up on getting the vegetables, which our server brought to me as she brought my to go box, because, according to her, she asked around who's veggies they were and no one claimed them so she figured out they were mine. I ended up taking home the majority of my food to eat at home. The wrap was good, but that was with extra ingredients requested by the manager. My guy said his food tasted good and was a large portion, but the chicken was more breading than meat. One star for a friendly server, the other star for the wrap tasting good, but only after doubling up on the ingredients. For my avocado wrap, his fried chicken and waffles, 2 ice waters and a glass of milk, $28.00. Likely, won't return."}
{"text":"Great food great service! I was impressed by how good everything was, this was my 1st time here and the omelette I had kept me full all day! If you get grits along with your omelette its just the right amount to eat together, good combination! The fish & chips was good as well can't wait until my 2nd visit!"}
{"text":"I caught the metro! 2nd time at metro 1st time at this location and just like the huntersville location! Great! Food. This was my 1st time getting the fried chicken and waffles. More than enough chicken, the waffles were crispy and the strawberry butter was good! This is becoming a sure go too in charlotte!"}
{"text":"Today was my third visit. Service and food had been  great but  for some reason today their service was bad. I sat at my table for close to 10 minutes before they took my order and that was only because I flagged a waitress and told her. There was one waitress that kept walking pass my table and she never bothered to ask if I had been helped, there were plenty of empty tables so it's not like there were busy. The food was ok and there service failed today.  My wife was about to walk out but I convinced her to stay. Before my experience today I  would have given it a 4"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Best breakfast and lunch. Great, quick service. Sitting at the bar is the best because you get to watch all of the food come out. The weekly specials are always changing so there's always something new and amazing to try. I'm obsessed."}
{"text":"I have  a lot of food allergies. If you have food allergies, don't go there! I was yelled the first time (literally) in front of 20 customers or so and sick from the food the second time. I've never experienced such disrespect and lack of compassion at a restaurant until I ate here."}
{"text":"Well executed service for breakfast and lunch. If you like multiple choices for breakfast MD does good however, if you're a two eggs, protein, hash browns, toast and coffee customer you might want to find alternatives such as Stacks ($5) or Waffle House."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars. We had to check out the new Metro Diner because my hubby has a soft spot in his heart for a good diner!  We went in for an early Saturday morning breakfast. We had great and friendly service. They were right on top of filling our coffee and accommodating our kids. No lattes, which is always disappointing, but they did have flavored coffee.  I had a special request and they happily created the perfect breakfast for me! My eggs were cooked perfectly. They serve their toast dry...butter on the side. This is a bummer. By the time the toast gets to me, and I try to spread chilled butter on luke toast, I'm not getting desirable results. Additionally, I'm certain a diner (by genre) suggests everything is buttery and greasy in the best way. Unfortunately, my toast wasn't. The home fries were under-seasoned fried potato cubes; no pizazz here and forgettable. The side of pecan raisin French toast was excellent. It wasn't too sweet at all. It was scrumptious!! Syrup is sever on the side and warmed. Nice touch!  Everyone was pleased with their meal and my hubby raved about his cheesy grits.  I will certainly return and try other items.  It's cute inside and everyone was welcoming."}
{"text":"Good food even better service... nice to have a new diner in town... try the cheesy grits!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! They have a wide variety of options on the menu, I am a vegetarian and had tons of choices. Their daily specials are really great and creative, and the staff is lovely and very caring.  The portions are very generous for the price and the food is all scratch made! The eggs Benedict was perfectly cooked which we can never find anywhere so we were really thrilled. No fake meat crab cakes, it was all real crab! The yo hala on the square is absolutely delicious with fresh berries and the hash browns are huge and so good. Will be back tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great experience!!! Gold star service from all staff including the trainees, and the food is phenomenal as always from Metro Diner! A really great and contemporary atmosphere where you always feel welcome and well cared for! Even though the place was packed I didn't feel like I was being pushed out the door, everyone was very helpful and thoughtful and made us feel like family. Just 15 minutes from Charlotte, it's really convenient to grab a bite and head into town! They will always work around your dietary needs and genuinely want to provide a great experience all around. Whether you want a family brunch or just to grab a bite with a friend late at night, this is my go-to place! Highly recommend their Chicken and Waffles, the Yo Halla on the Square, and the Shrimp and Grits - some of our favorites! I am also personally a hashrown addict and boy are theirs good!! Prices are really reasonable with generous portions and incredible quality. Thanks to the whole staff and manager Julie!!!!"}
{"text":"The fry chicken tastes just like my mother's. The best fry chicken I have ever had outside of her house. For that alone you get 5 stars. I liked the waffles and strawberry butter as well."}
{"text":"Just walking in he door you get hungry from the smell of breakfast. Whether you're dinning alone, as a couple or in a group, the seating here can accommodate you. There's counter service, booths, tables with chairs and a small outdoor seating area. It's a great local spot for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner. In all of the multiple times I've been in, I have never had a meal I did not like!  The staff is always friendly, the service is always great and the food is consistent. The open kitchen let's you watch all of the action. Fresh brewed iced tea and coffee, often with rotating flavors (examples brewing peach, raspberry, mango tea and French vanilla, hazelnut for coffee) Portions are worth the price.  The Food... A few of our favorites are.... 1. The chicken fried steak! It's a real piece of meat, not super processed and frozen. Hand battered when you order and fried to perfection. It is not on the everyday menu, but if you ask and they have all of the necessary ingredients, they'll make one for you.  2. Fried chicken and waffles. Their fried chicken is amazing! Flavorfully seasoned and fried golden brown. The waffle that it is paired with is fantastic too! I like to take some honey or syrup and hot sauce mixed together for a little spicy & sweet dip.  3. Charleston shrimp & grits. The fried grit cakes with cheese, covered in shrimp sauce, topped with shrimp, bacon is both filling and tasty.  4. Huevos Rancheros. This is when I found their magical fried jalape√±os slices (that go good on EVERYTHING). It's breakfast nachos."}
{"text":"First time visit and was amazed at the great food, good prices and super friendly staff! We had a chance to sit at the counter and watch this team up front and WOW! the people were actually happy to be there and were doing an amazing job at preparing the food in unison. No complaining, no hurry up, just a great team working together. The food was great and we will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Metro diner is still really new in the area and I've already eaten here three times the food is really good and worth the price they give huge portions and service is usually good they have the best shrimp and grits and really good French toast I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Not sure if it was the owner or just the host that ended-up being our waiter, but the service wasn't up to snuff and the food was barely mediocre. Living in Vegas, there are 100s of restaurants to choose from, and since this one was featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, I assumed the food and service would be phenomenal- not so. I was overly excited to try a burger and fries from the show. The fries were horrible and the burger was just so-so. The side order of mac-n-cheese tasted like 3-week-old cafeteria food! There were plenty of things on the menu that I wanted to try, but based on this first visit, I'm not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"I came to Metro for the first time on a Saturday afternoon, we didn't have a wait, and a very friendly hostess sat us at our booth.  They have a menu with a lot to offer, you can even order breakfast for dinner, watch out IHOP, they also had specials on a board in addition to the menu. I chose the Bold City burger, delicious!  How could it not be?  A burger with a sausage patty, yummy!  I also ordered mixed veggies for my side which were very tasty, better than expected.  I ordered the peach tea and it was also really good. My boyfriend had the Fried Chicken plate, and the mashed potatoes were sooo good.  He also got a huge portion of food, 4 pieces of chicken!   My friend ordered a special which was shredded pork on a cornbread waffle, I tasted her waffle because being the Southern chick I am, I love cornbread,  and I loved that waffle, I could make a meal on that alone, but wouldn't want to because there's too many things I want to go back and try. I really want to go back for breakfast one day.   This restaurant is one of my new faves.  Give it a try, you won't leave hungry. The waitress and staff are also very friendly here."}
{"text":"Just an average overpriced. Duplicate of their other locations. Ok but nothing special."}
{"text":"This is a Wonderful place to eat. I have been here twice since I live out of State. Both times I've had wonderful food and great service."}
{"text":"Everyone is super nice. Cute atmosphere. Prices are high but there is an option for half orders. Monte Cristo is way to breaded. So think that it's impossible to taste the inside. So I dug out what was inside and ate that which wasn't much. Literally the outside breading was 1/2 - 1 inch thick. No joke. We also had chicken and waffles. My son enjoyed that"}
{"text":"This place won't disappoint! Breakfast all day everyday and portions for forever! Prompt courteous service and staff."}
{"text":"When I saw \"Guy Fieri Favorites\" I was super excited since I love his TV Show. A diner in Las Vegas with his name on it can be only at the top.  When I walked in, It got a warm welcome, the restaurant was not that busy, with a mowtown music in the background. I ordered the: Roasted Veggie (the only item in the Veggie Section) my order come quickly. Unfortunately the \"Baguette\" was just a soggy unfroze piece of bread who as nothing to do with a French baguette, it was stuffed with some overcook veggies and cover with a can tomato sauce. After a first bite , it tasted like a ratatouille in bread. I was so hungry, I finished it. The french fries were nice but when I asked for mayo ( yes I am one of those who eat french fries with mayo), I was surprise to get some \"mayo packet\". The service was good since a trainer was behind the server to check what she was doing. I asked about desert, the lemon key pie was not homemade but deliver everyday from another company. My only reason I add one star was the service. Maybe my expectations were much higher, but if you go down the street next to the freeway, there is a famous chain diner restaurant open 24hours a day who is better than \"Metro Diner\". And finally for the managing partner who associate Guy Fiery name with his restaurant, the only thing who come in my mind is...: You can put lipstick on a pig...."}
{"text":"Metro Diner - Las Vegas, NV (Rainbow Location)  Prior to this visit, I've only eaten at the Tropicana location.  I can vouch for the food and the excellent service at the Trop location.  I have never received less than stellar service from an employee of Metro Diner and food has always been good. So, I expected the same excellence at this Metro Diner.  Our main server was Mary Lu and she was great.  She even recognized us from the other location.  She is a machine, a well-oiled machine.  She was taking orders, serving the food, checking up on guests, and cashing them out.  This Metro is new and I assume that most of the staff is new too. Thank goodness for Mary Lu.    As for their food, it's all good. The have their signature dishes like the Chicken & Waffles, the Shrimp & Grits, the Bold Burger, the Chicken Pot Pie, and the fried sourdough Monte Cristo.  There's also a ton of other breakfast dishes, burgers, sandwiches, and seafood in the menu. Here's a tip...most dishes are huge.  Come here hungry or expect to take home leftovers.  I've tried half of their signature dishes and recommend the Chicken Pot Pie.  My favorite dish isn't even on their menu.  I love their Meat Lover's Omelet.  It's a handful of eggs stuffed with bacon, sausage, ham, cheese, and awesomeness.  It's not on their menu, but they can create it for you.  On my most recent visit, I got their hamburger patty with a side of eggs.  And because Metro Diner allows you to make substitutions on almost everything, I swapped the hash browns for a cup of their broccoli and cheese soup. This cup of soup is also worth the trip back.  I know, I'm raving about broccoli.  Who loves broccoli?  Well, I do if it's at Metro Diner.  I highly recommend this as a side.  My mom would be proud.  I ate all my veggies.   Overall, I am more than just a fan.  I think Metro Diner is as good as it gets when it comes to breakfast eats.  It also doesn't hurt that Metro Diner believes in great customer service.  If I have one regret, it's giving the Tropicana location just 4-stars because they're better than that.  In fact, I'm changing that review to 5-stars soon."}
{"text":"Metro Diner - Las Vegas, NV (West Trop Location)  Those that know me know that I prefer to eat breakfast dishes all day every day.  It was just a matter of time before I finally got to check this breakfast bookmark off my list.  Metro Diner is a hit with locals and it's not uncommon for there to be a wait. I attempted to dine here about a month ago, there was 3 groups ahead of me, and I didn't want to wait.  I finally had the opportunity to dine here last week on a Friday afternoon.  The parking lot was full and the restaurant was busy.  There was plenty of tables open and I was immediately seated.  Metro Diner's menu is extensive.  They're known for their Charleston Shrimp & Grits, the Fried Chicken & Waffles, and the Bold City Burger.  I know what I want and it was their special...The Meat Lover's Omelet.  This meal consists of 3 large eggs, bacon, ham, and sausage. The meal also comes with toast and grits.  In my opinion, the grits were a little too salty for my liking.  My omelet was good and highly recommend.  I thought that the portions are average and the prices just a tad higher than the other breakfast joints in town.  The highlight of my first experience at Metro Diner is the service.  The entire staff was very attentive and checked up on me multiple times.  Overall, I recommend Metro Diner because they have so many options and the service is top notch."}
{"text":"Metro Diner (Henderson, NV)  It really doesn't take much to please me when it comes to breakfast food.  Good food, large portions, great value, and superb customer service is enough to make me a repeat customer. Heck, it's enough to give an establishment 5 Stars.  I've been to all of the Metro Diner locations in Las Vegas.  A couple of things are guaranteed whenever I dine at Metro Diner  #1:  I am always going to order a cup of their broccoli and cheese soup #2:  I am always leaving stuffed #3:  The service is excellent  Metro Diner has a few signature items like the Chicken & Waffles, Monte Cristo, Chicken Pot Pie, Bold Burger, and Shrimp Grits.  The Chicken Pot Pie is a \"must try\" as well as their Chicken & Waffles.  My go-to meals at Metro Diner is their Meat Lover's Omelet and a cup of their broccoli and cheese soup.  The Meat Lover's Omelet is not on the menu, but they will create it upon request.  Metro Diner has also created a protein only breakfast for me, which consist of eggs, bacon, hamburger patty or chicken breast, and sausage.  The good stuff!!  Metro Diner is consistent when it comes to servicing their guest.  Regardless if they're jammed packed or dead slow, I have never received anything less than stellar service.   Great Job, Metro Diner!!  TIP #1:  Hours (Sun-Thurs 7:00 AM-8:00 PM, Fri-Sat 7:00 AM-9:00 PM) TIP #2:  Metro Diner is great about substitutions.  TIP #3:  Daily Double.  Two visits in one day equal a 10% discount on the 2nd visit."}
{"text":"First time here. Had the meatloaf with zucchini and squash. It was excellent. Completely exceeded my expectations . Definitely will be back. Customer service was off the hook!"}
{"text":"I took my parents to eat there and we absolutely love this place. They have the best fruitty waffles and the fruits on the waffles were very sweet and fresh. They also have the big fish sandwich but it is not very nice the menu and you have to ask the server. I like this place better than the one on Independence because they have self  serve coffee bar. Breakfast is served all day."}
{"text":"Food is amazing As well as the service. It's roomy, the huevos rancheros are delicious.  My son enjoyed the chicken and waffles, especially the strawberry butter. We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"BEST Fried Chicken .. plain and simple! Coffee is pretty darned tasty, and they make their own strawberry butter which is to die for! The service is always top-notch, fast, friendly and consistent! Go try it!"}
{"text":"Listen, I don't just give out 5 star reviews. You've got to earn it, baby! I legit tried to think of a \"con\" to our visit, and there really wasn't one. Everyone at our table loved the entree they ordered- not a small feat. Our table had the pot roast, meat loaf, chicken and waffles, and protein breakfast. Hands down, the star of the show was the chicken and waffles. They give you half a chicken that is perfectly seasoned, perfectly fried, and perfectly juicy - even the breast! Dip it in the maple/hot sauce that the waiter mixes for you, and you're in chicken fried heaven."}
{"text":"Metro Diner is a cute homey place. I got the country fired steak and eggs (not on the menu). It was amazing. The gravy was perfectly created. It wasn't too runny. Wasn't too thick. Subtle layers of flavor. The steak was cooked well and the coffee (hazelnut) was brewed in house!  Not that syrup thing that Starbucks puts in. I thought I didn't like hazelnut coffee. I was wrong. I loved it.  What really drives this place to the top is the server. John A. He was attentive, gregarious, and funny. Actually everyone in the restaurant was friendly and thanked us for coming in. It's really one of those places that reminds me of how restaurants used to be. I felt like they actually cared if I enjoyed not only the food but the experience too.   Bonus points: playing Backstreet Boys as I'm writing this review. Good taste in music."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in on Valentine's Day for the first time. The atmosphere was very welcoming, the hostess was friendly as well. We were seated immediately. We had an exceptional waiter by the name of John A., he recommended that I try the customer favorite Chicken and Waffles. It was by far the best that I've ever had! John A. Made a special sweet and spicy sauce table-side, it went amazing with the chicken. And the waffles were perfect with banana and strawberry and whipped cream. Overall awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Came here after the Autism fun walk. Portions are quite huge. I got the chickens and waffles and you basically get half of a chicken (breast, thigh, wing and leg). The strawberry butter on the waffle is freshly made and it is delicious! Never had anything like that before."}
{"text":"I think i've had chicken n' waffles 1 other time in my life, and i must say i feel like their's may be impossible to beat! AH-MAY-ZING! Tried the hallah bread french toast as an appetizer and once again, amazing, soft deliciousness! Pot roast was great too. I really love the selection on the menu, and want to try the pastrami sandwich, meat loaf and one of their omelets next time.  Service: John A get's and A for service lol! A+ actually! He is super attentive and made great recommendations. Because of him and the amazing food, WE WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Stopped by with my man to try out their Philly cheese steak and tomato bisque. I was excited because of the high reviews on yelp but honestly my experience was okay. The cheese steak needed more flavor. It needed some kick or something. It was pretty bland. It also came with a side salad but it had a rotten cherry tomato. It didn't look fresh. As for the tomato bisque, there was way too much oregano and it was too chunky. I expected more. I do have to say customer service was great."}
{"text":"Was referred this place by my co-worker and boy was I not disappointed. Great customer service and the food delicious, I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic little family joint. The service has always been friendly and quick. Portions are excellent along with a wide variety of food to select from. Breakfast menu is good for all. The daily soups are a nice options as well."}
{"text":"Just off the bat, walked in the door and greeted warmly and sat by Zo who also took our order. Being in the industry, Zo gave some of the best service I've ever had. Above and beyond of what I'd expect from your neighborhood diner. Food is delish traditional diner food. We had the French dip and Ruben finished with a peach cobbler. Prices are a little high but great ambiance."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place!!! The food is on point no matter what time I go. I love the chicken and waffles, as well as the pot roast."}
{"text":"Yummy challah stuff French toast! Def for all that's craving something sweet. Huge portion, took the other half home. Very clean, nice diner. Lots of floor space and they even have outdoor seating"}
{"text":"Great value for breakfast or lunch.  I typically get the honey Chicken biscuit for breakfast that sells for $3.99.  Best deal on the menu.  The service is very consistent and delivers on a local feel.  The only opportunity is the bathroom situation. Only one stall bathrooms are available and when it's busy, there is typically a line."}
{"text":"Really welcoming, kind and professional staff. I had a very good Benedict and fruit bowl. Was a great experience!"}
{"text":"I got three words for ya: CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. Also, I love that strawberry butter more than certain relatives of mine."}
{"text":"The tomato bisque is amazing!  I don't even like tomato soup and I love this bisque!  The service is prompt and friendly and everything that I've tried has been good."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating at Metro Diner, and it is as good as the first time! Great staff and clean environment! I recommend this place highly!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Metro Diner!  Great menu- huge portions.  So happy to have this place nearby.  Yummy food and probably the best part is yet to come....,Bloody Mary's are on their way to the menu!"}
{"text":"By far the best restaurant around .  Such a wide range in verity of food . Been there everyday so far just to try it all out. Would go here before any other big box chain restaurants . Wait staff is fantastic, helpful and friendly .  They definitely have my business any day of the week twice on Sunday."}
{"text":"Metro Diner serves up a yummy, hearty breakfast without breaking the bank. I've eaten here twice in less than a week, both times I ordered off the breakfast menu. I love their hash browns, they make a really tasty medium-well egg, and their biscuits are so fluffy. Metro is by far my favorite spot to eat off of Exit 23."}
{"text":"I was torn between the highly regarded biscuit and gravy dish and a bacon, egg and cheese croissant so I ordered both. The biscuits and gravy were okay...ginormous, but did not have that buttermilk, southern-style taste I was looking for. Also, I did not like that they were drenched in gravy and sitting in a massive pool of it. Why not drizzle some gravy on the biscuits and then put some on the side to enable the customer to add more if they want to? I returned the dish to the waitress. As for the croissant sandwich, if it wasn't for the bacon, it would've been bland as hell. I expected them to butter and lightly fry each side of the croissant prior to assembling the sandwich to add buttery cheesy goodness, but they did not do that which made it a below average experience. Strike 3 was dessert. I ordered the peach cobbler and received a extremely sweet peach crumble/crisp as big as my face. Although the service extended was good, with disappointment on top of disappointment, I couldn't wait to leave. I won't be returning however if you want to try this place and you're particular about your food like I am, let them know how you want your dishes prepared in advance."}
{"text":"First time here, I always drive by going to work and seeing the reviews made me want to try this place.  Walked in, cute diner. Wasn't packed or anything but wasn't slow either. Hostess was very nice and welcoming... my waitress was really nice, she was so sweet. I got the bacon, egg and cheese croissant w/ a side of hashbrowns. Coffee was really good I got hazelnut flavor. Food was delicious:) prices are decent but they give you a good size portion. I definitely recommend this place if you haven't tried it :)"}
{"text":"We went to Metro Diner today for the first time.  Hubby had the chicken pot pie and I had the chicken and waffles.  Pot pie had a great biscuit top and was piping hot.  Needless to say it was a clean plate experience for hubby.  My waffle was crispy, light and delicious with a great strawberry butter!  Chicken was crispy and delish! As for service, Lamont was awesome.  He gave us great recommendations and was super attentive and pleasant!  We loved how the order was taken with an electronic device and you could pay at the table without ever losing sight of your card! We will be back to try more items that tantalized our tastebuds while they were served to other tables!"}
{"text":"After seeing a bunch of reviews on my timeline and becoming intrigued by the strawberry butter on their Fried Chicken and Waffles, my boyfriend and I decided it was a sign that it was time to try this establishment after they opened up a new location close to where we live. This restaurant chain has 3 locations across the valley (and according to their website, another one opening soon on Serene and Eastern). It specializes in big portions and comfort food.  Interior: Many tables and booths available. Like the name implies, it looks exactly like any other All-American diner. The decor is very cute and reminds me of all the lunches eaten in the middle of long road trips in small towns along the way to my destination.  Service: Service was pleasant. Our waitress was very nice, knowledgeable of the menu, and very accommodating. Food came out quickly.  Food: Bold City Burger ($12.99): Consisted of Provel cheese, caramelized onions, bacon, sausage, fried jalape√±os, and garlic aioli on a brioche bun with a side of fries. My boyfriend ordered this and fell in love with it. The burger was gigantic and a lot more filling than he anticipated. He only finished half of it, and that's saying something considering he's a never-ending vacuum (still love him, though!).  Fried Chicken and Waffles ($15.99): Maybe I don't eat a lot, but this plate can easily feed two people. It comes with 3-4 giant pieces of fried chicken, a whole Belgian waffle sprinkled with powdered sugar on top, strawberry butter, and their signature sweet and spicy sauce (it's basically Louisiana hot sauce and syrup). They really meant it when the menu said it was half a chicken! The chicken was crispy and the breading was not too heavy. The sauce gives a good kick to it and you could add as much (or as little) hot sauce to your mixture as you need. Since the fluffy Belgian waffle already had powdered sugar on it, I was afraid that the strawberry butter would cause it to have a sweetness overload. Thankfully, the flavor of the strawberry butter was subtle.  I had my doubts considering this is a chain restaurant. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I will be returning here soon. This time, with an emptier stomach!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and service was excellent. The food is a tad pricey for what you get. I tried the French Toast croissants which were amazing. This does not come with any sides. My mother had a BLT with fresh fruit and my daughter was going to eat the meatloaf. The meatloaf came with mashed potatoes with gravy. She didn't like the meatloaf because it was very dry and it was burnt a bit. They generally serve the meatloaf with gravy on it but my daughter didn't want the gravy on the meatloaf so the dryness is probably normally hidden that way. We ended up changing that out for chicken tenders.  The chicken tenders were good and they came with two sides. My daughter chose French fries and coleslaw. Both sides were good to her also. We did not try dessert because we were full but we were offered dessert. Our waitress was very friendly and this is somewhere I would go again."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I tried the Huevos Rancheros and enjoyed their unique and delicious spin on the traditional Mexican breakfast dish. Next time, I will ask for it without the meat, though! I didn't know it contained some type of sausage"}
{"text":"Braaaand new and apparently with other new locations in vegas area coming too. Came in on a Saturday afternoon they opened only last Monday. Surprisingly there were other customers visiting and a lot of employees still being trained. It has that retro diner look like johnny rockets or norms. The waiter was very attentive, a little overwhelmingly attentive probably because there wasn't much else for him to do. I had taken maybe three sips of my coffee and came back twice after I told him I didn't need a refill yet if I wanted more coffee. So I just gave in lol   Their menu is expansive the have their omlettes, pancakes and waffles, basic breakfast plates, burgers, sandwiches served all day so it can take a bit to decide. I chose the pot roast and it's actually really good. I'd go back for it. The meat was tender and the broth it comes in was perfect, the mashed potatoes too. It was all well seasoned and not too salty or bland and flavorful to the perfect level. The portions are also huge enough to save for two meals.   My friend ordered an omelette and he said it was still a bit undercooked on the center and the salsa they used he can tell was from the jar so he was a little disappointed about that . But he did praise their raspberry tea because it tasted like real fresh tea."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and so is the service!! Alonso was our server and he made our time so darn pleasant! Food came out fast and was delicious! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went on Sunday and had the eggs benedict. They were the best tasting that I have had in this town. Service was awesome and the price's were good. Love the old diner feel."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I came with my grandfather. We were greeted right away and sat down. Amazing service. Not sure exactly what our waitress name was but she had red hair and she was very helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. This place will definitely see me again"}
{"text":"Decided to give Metro another chance. So glad we did! Very friendly staff, food well prepared and a fair price. Will visit again the next time we're in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Well, The Cali girl in me was really looking forward to trying their version of chicken and waffles, however, we were greeted with the standard glass of water with a side of pure filth! Yep that's right, they gave us \"dirty dish water\", literally(picture attached)! Unfortunately I immediately lost my appetite and could not stay or bring myself to order anything."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinners at Metro Diner. I had the avocado toast and it was good--the toast was a little burnt, but the tomatoes and avocado were perfect in terms of ripeness and it had just the right amount of hot sauce. My husband had meatloaf and mashed potatoes and said they were \"good\" (not raving about it). The real star of the show was my son's chicken and waffles! The waffles were delightful with strawberry butter. Now my son says the fried chicken was a little salty. (My small bite dipped in the sweet and hot sauce was pretty good). But that was a lot of food! Two people could have shared the chicken and waffles.   The service here was good--not fabulous--but we didn't really have complaints and if I'm being honest, it would be tough for any server to keep up with my water consumption.  Based on my one dinner on a week night, the previous bad reviews weren't warranted or the management listens well. They are clearly reading the reviews.  I do think this place was a tad pricey but it was a lot of good food."}
{"text":"Great place for any meal! Never disappointed! Jocelyn is a great server, such a positive attitude and very attentive. Management is friendly and very active throughout the diner."}
{"text":"Went for Saturday breakfast, arriving just after 8 am.  It was moderately busy but no wait for a table.  Service was pretty slow for a diner breakfast - 30 minutes to get my food from the time I entered.    I had the fruity waffle (Belgian waffle with strawberries/blueberries/bananas) with bacon.  The food was very good.  There was a $2.89 upcharge for the bacon, which the waitress did not mention when she said \"Do you want bacon or sausage with that?\", so be warned.  Another long wait to pay - another server finally took my card.  There were folks waiting for a table by the time I left.  P.S. Don't bother looking for the Yo Hala or Pittsburgh Steak Salad dishes that Guy Fieri raved about on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives - this location doesn't sell them.  Weird, considering the website still features his clips."}
{"text":"I was surprised how much I enjoyed my meal! Great service, too! I had the meatloaf and my husband had the Bissel Breakfast. Both were very good! Fun local atmosphere (young and old). We will be back!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my breakfast here , I had a doctors appointment down the street and did have to fast , my bestie fasted with me and after appointment we were looking for a place nearby for some breakfast! This place did not disappoint !! We were greeted promptly at hostess area and seated asap , seats were comfy and menus were presented , being hungry we really had to study it to decide what would satiate us ! There are so many great choices , our server was patient and great ( didn't get her name but she was Hispanic and very very helpful in narrowing our choices ) I opted for the American omelette with biscuit and a side of gravy my friend ordered a big breakfast plate and to start off we had to share a cup of baked potato soup, the soup came out piping hot and dressed with cheese and bacon and tasted amazing, along comes the omelette stuffed full of paper thin steak, mushrooms,onions and cheese ( I added American , it's the way to go ). It was also served with home fries which were big chunks of potatoes that were perfectly cooked and crispy on outside and hot and soft inside ! The combo of flavors in omelette were on point ! When my fork hit the cheese pockets I was in heaven !! My friend did share a piece of her waffle which was perfectly crisp and delicious , try it with strawberry butter !! All in all I will be back and try the monte Cristo sandwich !!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a retro diner? That is exactly what you get here. Two tone glass globes for the ceiling lights. Chromed stools at the counter. Purse hooks beneath the counter. A black and white check tile floor. Diner favorites such as fried chicken, meatloaf, pot pie and burgers. Even some oldies (late 60s and maybe early 70s) playing on the PA. The only thing not part of the throw back feel of Metro Diner is the tablet device the wait staff record your order on; which, to quote the waitress, \"is the worst invention.\" I tend to agree.  Any how, I ordered what is in my mind a trifecta burger. That is to say a bacon, mushroom and swiss burger. I ordered it cooked to medium and it came out as such. The juicy beef tasted fresh. The cheese was melted perfect and gooey. The three slices of bacon were thick cut and came perfectly crisp. The mushrooms were fresh and shroomy. The rest of the toppings were simply shredded lettuce and one slice of tomato. Really it was just a generic burger. But there is nothing wrong with a generic burger if it is done right. The fries on the side were fries. Thick cut and natural with skins on.  Usually I would stop with the burger and fries. But the entire time I was waiting for my food and eating I could not help but stare at the chalk board on the far side of the restaurant. One dessert written on the board was taunting me. Bananas foster cheesecake. Um, yes please. So I ordered dessert today. It was good but not as good as I had hoped it would be. Basically it was a cheese cake with bananas in it. It was like eating banana pudding with the texture of cheesecake. It would have been nice if it reflected a true bananas foster more with a booze flavor. Regardless, it was a good dessert.  The diner was about half full today. Fairly busy I suppose. And the entire wait staff was running around like mad serving everybody at every table. They were friendly and attentive. There is a sign above the bar that reads something along the lines of \"Where the locals eat.\" And there were obvious locals here. The waitress knew a group that came in when I was finishing my cheesecake. She knew them by name and knew their drink orders before they even sat down. This is a good measure of quality customer service. Metro Diner may be a chain but they truly feel like a neighborhood establishment. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Holy moly ! I love this place !  The service was awesome and the people there were very sweet . I really enjoyed my biscuits and gravy with eggs and home fries and they have great coffee also .  I'll definitely come back here again"}
{"text":"This is a great place.  Food is very good and you get plenty of it. Service is excellent, fast and friendly. Best seat is at the counter.  You a great view of the food prep. Its like looking at the cooking channel live. Great fun."}
{"text":"Had a great Dinner here.  Very impressed with this place.  I'll write more later but the service, fried chicken and waffles and fresh coffee was an A+++++.  I'm Coming back again soon."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. It's pricy for what it is though, and the service is just ok. Overall it's a good addition to the restaurant selection in Huntersville!"}
{"text":"Must place on bucket list lol.  Basic diner with awesome food.  The waffles n chicken are some of the best had and the strawberry  butter just makes it next level!!!!! The scratch made corned beef hash with two eggs cooked perfectly medium and the fluffy moist biscuit with yup more strawberry  butter was just slap yo momma good!   I live at least 30 mins away but plan on another visit!   Peach  tea was too sweet for my taste but I don't like overly sweet drinks."}
{"text":"They have a great Monte Cristo sandwich. Yay. Good homestyle food., great customer service. John was our server and was great."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night. Great new neighborhood place. Good food and portion size and very reasonable prices. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened on Stephanie and we decided to check it out. We had chicken and waffles and the spicy chicken biscuit. Jenna/Jennifer was our server. Very friendly and The service was great. The food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Wasn't that impressed.. there were flies around us all dinner, took a waitress 10 just to acknowledge us, they got my order wrong, it wasn't that good, someone else in my party ordered something that they \"ran out of\", multiple other reasons but its safe to say I won't return."}
{"text":"I just tried Metro Diner for the first time today! I placed a to-go order and the manager was sincere and friendly towards customers and his staff. The food was excellent as well! I would love to come back next time with my parents who live out of town and dine in! Thank you and keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"WE LOVE DARLA !! Best service ever. Went here for the very first time on a little breakfast date with my dad. I'm a VERY picky eater on top of being a vegetarian so finding a place that we both agree on isn't always easy. Everything here was seriously amazing! Idk which was better, the food or the service. Metro Diner is definitely going to be our new regular place. Our server Darla was beyond perfect and I highly recommend her to everyone!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant at least five or six times now. I go every other Saturday to meet with a friend and more recently I've taken my son there for breakfast. I love this place because the employees are all very friendly and actually seem happy to see you when you come in. I don't know if it's a good or a bad thing that I am being recognized now because I go so often. I've had this server named Megan at least three times now and she remembers me and she is so sweet. I love how every employee is very attentive to you. There are no negative attitudes in this place. Oh, I guess I should talk about the food. The food is outstanding! Large portions and it feels like someone is cooking for you at their home. I've ordered the chicken and waffles and oh my God! They blew me away because there was so much chicken! I couldn't finish it all so I took it home. The chicken was hot, juicy, crispy just absolutely delicious. I hope they never change their portions. I hate how some restaurants start off really good with large portions and good prices and then slowly over time you see the portions start to get smaller but the prices stay the same or increase. As if the customers won't notice. I've had their grits and the cheesy grits are delicious. I've had the waffles, the omelettes, everything is really good. I'm actually trying to lose weight so this place isn't helping! My son just applied for a job here because I told him that I have a feeling he'd enjoy working there. Hope he gets hired!"}
{"text":"When you first walk in the location it is your basic diner. Which is fine it is nothing over the top most establishments in the area you are paying for the scenery/atmosphere, and not necessarily the food. The staff was super friendly, welcoming, patient, and helpful with plenty of friendly jokes/comments. The location serves breakfast, and lunch with beverage choices for both breakfast and lunch. No alcohol! So if you are one of those who needs an adult beverage with every meal you will miss out on it here.  Now as for the food.... it was a bit blah.... or maybe we ordered the wrong things! To be fair we asked the staff their recommendations, and because we were not wanting breakfast or big sweet eaters we chose other options (our fault).  I went with the philly cheesesteak with French fries. The fries were great! The cheesesteak bread was not soggy nor toasted so done that the bread cuts up the top of your mouth. Plenty of meat, cheese, and peppers. Wasn't disappointing. I felt content, and full. My companion ordered the Shrimp pull boy sandwich. He said it sucked. Like 1 star status. He said the gravy (sauce) was ranch dressing mixed with chipotle sauce. The shrimps were fried and he really needs to go back to New Orleans to get a real one hahaha!  Tip 1 from one food lover to the other.... Always order what the staff recommend."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed My food. And our server was very nice. I loved the veggie wrap!!!! So good. I'll get that again & again. They now serve Mimosa's too!"}
{"text":"I have driven past Metro Diner a couple of times now. My mother and I decided to stop in for some brunch. The first impression was great: staff was extremely friendly and the wait time wasn't bad for a Saturday afternoon.  Unfortunately, that's where the good part of the review ends. Our waitress seemed uninterested and lost. Yes, it was a busy Saturday morning but customer service skills are still important. I ordered pancakes with strawberries, which I thought would be delicious. Instead, it seemed that someone tried to cook whole strawberries in the pancakes (yikes) which resulted in the pancakes not being fully done. The eggs were also extremely funny. My mother enjoyed her croissant sandwich but we both agreed there was no flavor whatsoever in any of the food.  I would try this place again when it's dead because it seems that the food isn't good when they are busy. At least my toast, hash browns and bacon were good!"}
{"text":"Very fulfilling breakfast. Food was leathered with gravy and sausage. Good place to go if you're hungry and I need of a good local breakfast restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place!  Excellent choices, not overwhelming, but enough for everyone to get what they want.  Sat at the bar and watched the well-oiled-machine work through the busy Sunday brunch rush.  Service and kitchen were both on point.  Will definitely be back.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Great food.  Great staff.  The manager loves what she does and shows it on the floor.   She's always smiling.  Her staff are attentive, considerate, and professional.  The food was delicious.  I was there with a party of seven.  Everyone loved it.   Whenever I go to Las Vegas, I'm going there."}
{"text":"Wow!!  Metro Diner did not disappoint.   My fianc√© and I were both in the mood for a late breakfast (4 pm) so I checked yelp and stumbled across this hidden gem.  Metro diner has a tone of different food options for everyone in your party. I was craving potatoes and waffles and my fianc√© wanted French toast. Upon entering the eatery we were greeting with a smile and the option to sit anywhere we liked.  After only a few seconds our waitress stopped by to get out drink order and tell us all about their top items on the menu.  I ordered the massive order of chicken and waffles with a side of house fries and my fianc√© ordered the  enormous order of biscuits and gravy.     Everything was delicious  and I had plenty of chicken and waffles left over after sharing.   Metro dinner we will defiantly be back"}
{"text":"So my first experience wasn't a good one. We ordered it to go (yes I know breakfast isn't a to go meal but with two kids 5 and under...) with a phone call since it's literally down the street. They told us 20 minutes. I sent my husband and he ended up texting me 20 minutes later saying that this keeps happening to us. What happened was that he was waiting and they were so busy (which was a good thing I suppose since it means they are delicious) but they forget about him. When they finally remembered him they had given away our fried chicken and waffles. I told my husband to just leave since it was just ridiculous that he already waited 40 minutes (20 min at home and 20 min there) and they gave our meal away.   Well I got to try it this weekend after deciding to give it another chance. I got my fried chicken and waffles and the fried chicken was juicy and there was plenty of it to share with my littles. I do admit that I loved the strawberry butter and I wanted to slather that on everything I could get ahold of within reason. Overall the food was delicious but I would definitely recommend working on taking care of the to go orders too."}
{"text":"Dammit! I had such high hopes for this place. I've been wanting to eat here for months and finally ordered take out!....SO DISAPPOINTED! I ordered the corn beef hash and a half ordered of the yo hala thing. The corned beef was dry and tasteless, the bread was stale, and the yo hala was just ok. Waste of $20!   On the up side, the lady who took my order on the phone was super nice."}
{"text":"Best service I have ever gotten in a restaurant. I'm writing this review months after going to the restaurant, but I will always remember my server, Patience. She was INCREDIBLE and had amazing customer service. The manager even came over to check on us and chat for a bit. Really nice place.   The food was amazing. Huge portions. I had the chicken and waffles and also a eggs Benedict with avocado. DELICIOUS. I even bought the strawberry butter because it tasted like straight up ice cream.   Will definitely be going back to Metro Diner soon. Strongly recommend if you want a unique place to eat that is laid back, delicious and great customer service."}
{"text":"First time here for their first day open and I'm highly impressed. The diner had great, welcoming staff who have clearly been well trained. I live right around the corner so my boyfriend and I stopped here on a whim and I'm glad we did! I ordered the turkey plate, which was very flavorful and was not dry at all. Ignore the shmuck Alains review he doesn't know what he's talking about. Keep up the good work! We will be back! Great opening!"}
{"text":"Decided to pop in for a new breakfast experience! Usually a Another Broken Egg connoisseur but tried something different based on several positive reviews and recommendations AND SO GLAD I DID!  The food was pretty gooood  Hubby had the Bissell Breakfast $9.49 for 2 huge fluffy pancakes, 2 eggs, meat, choice of (toast/hash browns/grits) I had the Infamous Chicken and Waffles $15.49 nice fluffy Belgian waffle and Half of buttermilk style fried chicken (breast, thigh, leg, and wing) very tender! Comes with hot sauce syrup but I'm good with the basic hot sauce."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my family on Fathers Day. I love Metro Diner but usually go to the one on Rainbow. This location happened to be near church so we gave it a try. Food and service were great as always but this review is more for management. There was an issue that came about and was immediately addressed by Managing Partner La Triece Lee. She was empathetic,  professional and extremely efficient in providing a resolution. I am very impressed by how she handled the situation and she has earned myself and family as repeat customers!!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this spot for a minute and finally decided to give it a try with the kiddos. I love diner food so was pretty pumped to order the fried chicken plate. OMG. I am a huge fried chicken gal and aside from Roscoes this place has some LEGIT chicken!!! Would have gotten 5 stars but our waitress sucked"}
{"text":"Great addition to Charlotte!  I have been going to the Metro Diner in Jacksonville for years and was excited to see a location open in Pineville.    I have been to the Pineville location twice and both visits were great.  The server was knowledgeable and attentive.  Food was prepared quickly and was delicious.  Huevos Rancheros is as good as it gets.  Several takes on Eggs Benedict that others in my party really enjoyed.  I'm not sure if the Breakfast Pizza was removed from the menu at all locations or just the newer ones, but I would love to see it added."}
{"text":"This location recently opened up in our area and I'd been dying to try some good diner food. After a long afternoon of Christmas shopping, we decided to stop in for an early dinner. We were seated quickly and the hostess pointed out the daily specials as we began to browse over the menu. Lots of variety, including many tasty breakfast dishes and comfort foods. I ordered the hot turkey plate which tasted just like a good home cooked thanksgiving dinner. Their portions are massive so be prepared to have a hearty meal and if you cant conquer it, take the rest of it home to indulge in some delicious leftovers. Our server was simply fantastic. She was so helpful and brought our food to us very quickly. Same thing once we were finished with our meal, she was happy to bring out Togo boxes quickly and split our checks with ease. When we were leaving, at least a dozen employees told us \"thank you for coming in and have a wonderful day!\" With all that attention, we felt like celebrities! Can't wait to try this place again real soon."}
{"text":"Metro Diner on corner of Rainbow and Warm Springs.....great food (loved the cherry cobbler!),and great customer service. Timothy our server was fantastic! Stop by if u want comfort food and a pleasant dining experience!"}
{"text":"Good quality food, great service!   Metro Diner exceeded my expectations and I'd definitely come back! This isn't a cheap diner where employees just want to get you in and out. Its way better than an IHOP that's for sure. It's good quality food, freshly made, quick service and employees care about their guests. My boyfriend had the corn beef hash and I had two eggs with bacon. Both dishes were great and a good portion. John was so accommodating to our needs especially when we asked for a side of rice and avocado. The teas came in fancy yummy flavors. They used a very fancy and updated iPad system to take orders and pay for efficiency. Prices were reasonable also."}
{"text":"My wife and I had breakfast here earlier today. I've been dying to try this place out for awhile as it's been bookmarked on my Yelp list of places to try. I was expecting a long wait as it's the weekend, 4th of July weekend at that, and the parking lot looked packed, but to my surprise we were greeted and seated as soon as we walked in. The place was  pretty busy too.   Our server was Marylu (if I remember correctly) and she was great. I ordered coffee which was tasty(I'm picky on coffee) with the Bisell breakfast platter. I was happy with my order. The pancakes were perfect. Bacon crisp. Eggs fluffy and hash browns were tasty, along with a generous amount of toast. My wife, on the other hand, ordered the Pound Cake French toast with a side order of in house made corn beef hash. She wasn't too pleased with the pound cake, it was dry and it didn't resemble French toast. In her opinion. The corn beef hash was a bit of a disappointment too. It was dry to me, and to her it wasn't all that great. For being made in house, it didn't wow us. That's why I took off one star.   Other than that I would come back and try other things on the menu. There's so much to choose from!"}
{"text":"I've had breakfast here, which has always been good. Tonight was the first time I ate dinner here. I ordered shrimp & grits and was disgusted. Two bricks of grits absolutely drowned in basic white sausage gravy. Awful!"}
{"text":"This was the best breakfast we have had while visiting Vegas and best we've had in a long time.  The food was really really good, but Javier made it the best.  Our waiter was just fabulous.  I would be hard pressed to recall a time a waiter impressed us so.   I had the croissant French toast which was lovely.  I tasted my husband's biscuits and gravy which were seasoned perfectly and the biscuits were light and fluffy. Lots of sausage in the gravy too, not light on the meat.  My favorite thing was the home fries.  Javi explained that they use red potatoes and boil them and then do a quick deep fry.  They were perfection.     If you are hungry don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you about this place right here. I went in not knowing what to expect. When they brought the food out the food was so good. And the customer service was excellent. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good down-home cook meal. Ask for Austin the server. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Metro Diner is a great place to have breakfast. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that they don't offer a turkey bacon or sausage option. The portions are very large and the food is definitely good. They have call ahead seating as well! Call before so you aren't waiting for forever.   **update** I super appreciate the manager Tony reaching out and letting me know about the turkey options. I will definitely be going back to give it a try!"}
{"text":"If you live in the area, she used to be the Carl's Jr. kitty corner to the In n Out. We had no idea what to expect bc this particular stop mall isn't frequented by many but whenever I see \"Diner\" I'm trying it! Never mind that they had \"Shrimp and Grits\" on the window!   The staff is super friendly and one of them mentioned that they had opened just 5 days before we dined there.   The Shrimp and Grits is not what you're used to. Instead of loose grits, they're shaped into patties and breaded. The patties sit in a white gravy with different things mixed in. Was a bit nervous to try it as I'm a HUGE Shrimp n Grits kinda gal but I am so happy I tried it! It was different but it was good!   My husband had the Big Bern or something. He enjoyed it, one of those \"eyes rollin' to the back of his head\" type situations lol.  We'll definitely be back. Hopefully we get to try breakfast next time around, they had some tasty looking items on that menu!"}
{"text":"Chicken dinner plate or chicken and waffles, the fried chicken is legit here. I wanna say for a non-saucy chicken dish, this is the bomb."}
{"text":"Typical Diner look.  Ambience is not bad.  Clean.  Waitress are nice.  Food was bland.  No taste. Country potatoes were over fried and dark brown. It does not have diced veggies in it.  Just potatoes.  Salsa for Western omelet was not home made.  It's from cans.  Even ice tea and coffee were bland.   I can get better food elsewhere.  If you want a great breakfast with home made taste, go to Black Bear Diner."}
{"text":"They were quite busy for lunch on a Sunday. While sitting and waiting, I was able to observe the great team work and good service they provided, unlike the sister restaurant in Pineville.   Lunch was better than our breakfast experience in Pineville location.  My husband had the avocado wrap with grilled chicken and onion rings. I had the burger between two grilled cheese sandwich with their chips. We enjoyed our meals. It's your typical diner food, with a good selection and friendly service. Also a beverage center you can help yourself while waiting.  You can sit at the counter and watch the kitchen staffs and first come first serve.   Recommend and will come back for good diner food."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles here are so Good! Large portion  as well I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I've been here twice. First time Chicken and Waffles. Amazing. Second time Charleston Shrimp and Grits. Fan-freaking-tactic! And to make a great meal even better, I can't think of the last time I received such great service at a restaurant. Everyone was super friendly and although both times I visited it was SUPER busy the food came out in a fairly reasonable amount of time and the place was super clean."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of enjoying the soft opening for this place today. Of course in that situation everything is top notch.... but the food was amazing. So we will definitely be back. Lots of original options.   Not gonna lie.... wish we had ordered the chicken & waffles because that looked amazing! But we had already ordered by the time we saw that.   Surprising the coffee was delicious. I'm a coffee snob & never order coffee out because it's usually watery at restaurants. Not the case here. Full bodied & rich in flavor!   The beverage bar was a cool feature. It's kinda nice to serve yourself whatever drink you want & as much as you want.   Definitely give this place a try! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Just a diner.  Not much to satisfy someone who is into healthy or clean eating.  Atmosphere was nice for a diner, and service was good."}
{"text":"This is my second time at this restaurant and I must say they never fail to make me ! Nice and friendly environment ! Jim the GM and Andy the waiter have the best personalities ! I will continue to spread the word to family and friends !"}
{"text":"Excellent Diner. A bunch of people from places that know what diner food and service should be like. Eggs Benedict, French Dip, kids meals, all great with really good service from Shelly."}
{"text":"The best in Las Vegas for locals. Not only the best food, with all around flavor and creativity, but cooked well and the presentation was mouth watering. They have an open kitchen with front row seating at the bar. You can see that the chefs are well trained and have a good flow of communication with the servers and the head chef \"Sunshine\" delegates tasks with a smile. I love seeing a good team in a restaurant since I've been in the industry for over 10 years. I know how hard it is to create that atmosphere with so many different personalities. Hillary was our server and was quick to great us, knowledgeable of the menu and provided amazing service. I can't wait to come back as this is mine and my boyfriends new and only breakfast spot. The only thing that bothered me was how far away my stool was from the counter, the seats aren't adjustable. That being my only complaint, which is a personal issue, doesn't effect the 5 stars"}
{"text":"Maybe the original restaurant in Florida is good.. but this place is riding on the hopes people will eat there cause it was on diners and dives. I ordered a basic burger.. dry no flavor and their relish mix is disgusting unless you love mayo drenched lettuce. Wife ordered ahi Tuna sandwich .. not only did our whole booth smell like old fish once served..., is was basically 2 fish sticks on a bun. Daughters French toast was the only plate worth the money and looked decent. Prices were on the high side. Son had 4 eggs with 4 sausage patties and I believe it was $12. Our total bill was $70. Pricey for low quality food. Service was great.. people were nice.. but the food was... blah! Sorry don't like leaving bad reviews., better off eating at.. i hop and that's to bad."}
{"text":"When I think Diner, I think Cheap breakfast home-cooked flavorful food. It disappointed which is a bummer because it's so close to our house. We will continue to head to The Egg in Davidson.   Pros: Food isn't bad but no home cook meal feeling. Would be better with the prices for Lunch/Dinner. Service wasn't bad.  Cons: Home fries are huge chunks of potatoes with no flavor, and well done means nothing. Food took forever to come out. English muffin was half burnt.   Do not come if you like a flavorful breakfast. Generic bland food."}
{"text":"Excellent biscuits and gravy he and sweet tea service was terrific atmosphere terrific"}
{"text":"We tried Metro diner after a long, hot day at Wet & Wild water park for two reasons.  One, it was right around the corner, and two, it had a little bit of everything that our large party wanted, from comfort good to breakfast.  The service was great and quick.  The chicken fried steak and chicken pot pie were about the best I've ever tasted in Vegas.  And the fresh strawberry cobbler was just so tasty, but such a large portion - six of us could of shared it.  We definitely will be back for the chicken pot pie!"}
{"text":"Chain diner restaurant located near Eastern.  We came on a Saturday during lunch and it was packed. Since it was just the two of us we were seated in five minutes.  There was a large selection of breakfast, brunch, and lunch items. They even had some healthy offerings. I had the avocado toast and eggs. The avocado toast was a very generous portion and I could not finish it all. It was yummy and fresh though. Next time I'm going to spoil myself and get the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"This location opened up in my usual stomping grounds and we wanted to give it a try. We went for Sunday brunch and there was a bit of a wait but it was expected so it wasn't a big deal.  Everyone was very polite and friendly and you can tell that there were a lot of regulars dining in.   The MONTE CRISTO SANDWICH was amazing. I definitely recommend it! The sourdough is fried to a perfect crisp. And when they say it is stuffed with turkey and ham, they mean it is STUFFED. The raspberry preserves were a bit different (I'm used to strawberry) but it complimented the sandwich very well.  I need to plan a trip back to Metro Diner asap to try more of their menu, especially the chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Metro Diner!  We have only lived in Matthews for a few months, but this place has been my favorite discovery so far.  I lived on the coast of North Carolina for many years, and never found a place that made crabcakes benedict there.  It is a breakfast to die for!  I have raved about it to my coastal friends and my new friends that I work with uptown.  I did once get hashbrowns instead of the grits that I ordered, but they were so good that I didn't send them back!  The servers are always friendly and I always leave full and happy!"}
{"text":"We have visited twice. First time food was good service was awful but that was the first week they opened. Visited again this evening and we will not be back. My husband got the Greek omelette. The filings were just set on top of the eggs and were cold. The side of grits were so thin it was like eating chunky water. Service yet again was terrible. When the waitress brought our check she was chewing food. She disappeared often and hardly refilled our drinks."}
{"text":"My first time being here was amazing. There was a wait for good reason , but the coffee at the front made the wait easy.  I ordered the chicken and waffles... and let me tell you!!!! The waffles were great with their own strawberry buttery blend.   But that chicken!!!!! Simply amazing. Id rate 10 stars if i could.. super clean and great customer service. I'll most def me back soon"}
{"text":"It's like your classic breakfast joint (IHOP, Dennys, Egg Works, etc) but it has more of a community feel. It's most definitely a chain restaurant, but they somehow captured the feel of a small community diner. Plus, they have more option than your average breakfast joint.  As someone who spent a lot of time living in Texas, it was nice to see some grits (cheesy or plain) on the menu. I got them plain with my Bissell breakfast, and oh boy, it was like nostalgia with every creamy bite. They're not bad, but they definitely don't compare to the grits you get back in the South.  As for the rest of the Bissell breakfast, I got 2 sunny side up eggs, dry sourdough toast, bacon, grits, and half a waffle (subbed a waffle instead of pancakes). The eggs were okay. Nothing that warrants a deeper explanation. They were cooked fine. I feel like everything was cooked well, but nothing really sets this place apart in terms of taste/flavor.   What makes this place unique is the options they have like chicken and waffles and grits as well as their homey, community feel. Other than that, the flavor is pretty average in the sense that I got what I expected and wasn't completed blown away.  The service was spot on and our waitress came by every 5-10min or so to refill waters and ask if we needed anything. Something that sets them apart from other chains is their service. I feel like their waiters waitresses are all very friendly and approachable.  Overall, if you're looking for a decent breakfast place that makes you feel very welcomed and you want some more breakfast variety, Metro Diner is your place."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!  Great food, service, and atmosphere.  The pot pie is to die for.  Till next time."}
{"text":"Love their chicken and waffle! The service was great.  Took one star out because I just can't believe with this size of restaurant they only 2 restroom one for woman and one for men so if the restaurant is busy then the wait for the restroom is going to be longggg."}
{"text":"My friend lives in Las Vegas and she mentioned that Metro Diner was opening and it had been featured on Diners, Drive ins and Dives.  I googled it  I watched the show from 2010.  They featured a dish called Yo Hala on the Square.  I decided that I needed that.    Arrived in Vegas on Sunday and Metro was on the schedule for Monday's first meal of the day.  When you're on vacation the first meal may not be before noon but, fear not, breakfast is served all day.  These are my kind of people.    The restaurant is clean and bright.  There were plenty of open tables and we were seated immediately.  Our server, Nick, showed up promptly.  Specials are listed on a blackboard.  Between that and the menu, choices are difficult--a tough problem to have--but I already knew what I would be getting.  My friends perused the menu with the understanding that they would each be getting a portion of my food because it sounded like the best thing that ever got invented...food-wise.  We felt so welcomed there.  Both managers stopped by the table to ask how things were.  Nick was never too far away and came back often.  He liked us and, make no mistake, we loved his service.  Everyone seems to enjoy conversing and bantering with the customers.  We were laughing so much with them I don't know how we were able to eat.  The food was dynamite.  We all oohed and aahed over our huge and beautifully plated dishes and each enjoyed our choices very much.  I couldn't finish mine.  I'm told that most people can't.  Mine was the big hit of the table.  Of course.  I have to admit that I grabbed some local friends and brought them back there the next day because I needed to try other things.  I was laughing so hard when everyone came by to welcome us back.  Nick was there but he was leaving for the day so he couldn't serve us but he definitely stopped by as if to catch up with old friends.  Our server on this day was Jaci (pronounced JayCee).  She is so sweet and delightful.  I tried the avocado breakfast sandwich.   After I had ordered, the table next to us had received a Monte Cristo sandwich.  OMG that looked so good that I wanted to change my mind.  Then, another table got a French Dip sandwich.  That looked so good that I wanted to change my mind.    That just means I have to go back again on my next trip.    Prices are reasonable and our service was peerless.  It's a friendly place and, even if the food weren't as excellent as it was, I'd still give it a great rating because I had so much fun just being there.  Ask for Nick or Jaci as your servers.  I'm sure the others are very good but these two are exemplary and will add to your overall enjoyment of the experience.  P.S. The place has only been open a few weeks so I suspect that anybody who did not have a great food experience could chalk that up to the kitchen staff getting up to speed and finding their stride."}
{"text":"We tried the Chicken & Waffles and the Shrimp & Grits. Both were amazing! The service was awesome! We will definitely be back....highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit today and we are already talking about going back again tomorrow.  Love the vibe, d√©cor, the friendliness of the staff, and the amazing food!  This is for sure our new favorite restaurant in Charlotte and not sure why it took us so long to visit.....  Great selection of menu items and quality food.  The interior reminded us of our younger years in the old fashioned diners in our home towns - love the open Kitchen area.   LIZ was amazing!  Super helpful, knowledgeable and so sweet!  All we could have asked for and then some.....Once you go you will understand; one of Charlotte's best kept secrets."}
{"text":"My waiter  Phillip was nice and attentive, they have a great team and a great work place! Rare now a days to have restaurants like this. This place is highly recommended by Me"}
{"text":"After two dining experiences here I can say that I really like this new addition to the Henderson breakfast scene. Metro does more than just breakfast, but so far I've only dined in for breakfast. The food is good, service is friendly, and it's a quick dine-in option.  Metro is on their game with efficiently serving up good food. We've never had to wait long for a table and the food is quick to arrive at the table. The front of the restaurant has a comfortable waiting area for busy times. The servers have been friendly and accommodating. The inside of the restaurant has an old school diner feel, but cleaner and more open.  I've enjoyed a Crab Cake Benedict and Sausage Gravy & Biscuits. Both were delicious and came out as generous portions. The hash browns on the side were tasty too. My orders have been correct and well prepared both times. Next time I'll have to try the signature Chicken & Waffles!"}
{"text":"This restaurant opened a little over two months ago and I have eaten there on four separate occasions, last night being the most recent.   I cannot say enough good things about Metro Diner. Every time, the food has been delicious, the service prompt, and the staff was amazing!    Our server last night was Nichole and she was absolutely awesome!  She was extremely efficient and could not have been more friendly.   If you haven't eaten at Metro Diner, you definitely should. If you have, then you know EXACTLY how great of a place it is. It has become my family's absolute favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"The best dish in this place are the Fries Chicken. Very tender and well marinated...tasty ^3^ Yummy"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! The waffles were made exactly how I wanted them and my eggs with hash browns were crispy perfection. The manager and our waiter were very attentive and understanding. My mom ordered the huevos rancheros but we are Mexican and are harsh critics on their American take on the eggs. Even so, we were more than willing to pay for our mistake, but the manager took care of it anyways! We even said that you dont go to a diner for Mexican breakfast, you go to Abuelita's for that. Will always be a customer of Metro Diner and leave happily full!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  I've been here a handful of times now, the service is always friendly and the food is delicious.    This mixed berries waffle is one of my favorites.  I'm picky about waffles and theirs is perfectly made."}
{"text":"Meh. I don't get it. This place is nothing special. Service is always good but the good is just so blahhh. Nothing special.   For breakfast, the corned beef hash meal is OK. But there are so many other better breakfast options nearby.  For dinner, had the French dip but was nothing special. And the au jus was actually cold. Nothing like dipping a warm sandwich into cold au jus!  Skip this place."}
{"text":"I don't know what people are talking about with Metro Diner. Four of us went this evening and this was by far some of the lowest quality food I have ever had The Misfortune of eating at any price range. I only gave it one star because the service was very friendly, and you couldn't give it to zero Stars anyway. The way I would describe Metro Dinah is the epitome of corporate industrial food that is just fit for human consumption but little more. I was so disappointed because one would think the name Metro Diner evokes feelings of quality food like on the East Coast. Not liking something is one thing but really food that is tasteless and low quality is a whole nother thing. If you want to go to chain restaurants there are plenty that are way better than this."}
{"text":"I ordered a simple plate of French toast with powdered sugar. The husband ordered the turkey dinner plate and the girls had chicken fingers with fries and the breakfast platter.   To keep things plain and straightforward, I really wouldn't make this place my go to for breakfast or diners overall.   ALTHOUGH, their chicken fingers was light and crispy. Probably if you're craving for some fried chicken. This would be the best option for that. In fact I would recommend their fried chicken over anything else on the menu.   The staff were beyond friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles. Enough said. Great place with friend staff and owners! This place has become one of my favorites now!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the food: breakfast burger is delicious and large. The over medium egg on the burger was cooked perfectly. The Onion rings were also perfect. My wife had grits that were obviously real grits, not quick or instant. They were creamy and one of the best bowls of grits ever. Her scrambled eggs were fluffy and cooled to perfection. The gravy biscuits were also perfect. We can't say enough good things about the food or the generous porportions. What? Only 4 stars? Let's move on to the service. Our server was very nice and very sweet. Attentive? Not so much. Never noticed when drinks were low. Had to flag her down to get extra napkins because she wizzed by us every time. At check time (and we needed boxes) my wife got up to go find her. A little more effort on service and this is a 5 start all the way. We WILL be back and try more items from this epic menu that serves breakfast, lunch, & dinner all day."}
{"text":"Good choice in the neighborhood... large portions and taste very traditional American lines... may go back to try more"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great good with HUGE portions, that can easily be split between two people. If you don't know what to order, I would suggest sitting at the bar. That way you can see everything enticing! But, I would highly recommend the chicken strips and waffles."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles were amazing. Staff was very friendly, everyone worked as a team and you could tell"}
{"text":"Food and service are fantastic. So glad we found this spot while we were in town. Meatloaf is legit"}
{"text":"This is by far the best  breakfast place in town . It's makes jams look ordinary, you get what you ask for   I can't believe I missed this place ."}
{"text":"I actually found their page on Instagram. I ordered the spicy honey chicken biscuit. And my mouth watered as soon as I seen it. Sooooo good! 5 stars. As soon as you walk in everyone is friendly and welcoming. My new favorite restaurant. I can't wait to order everything else on the menu. Lol"}
{"text":"Great service, great food and they don't keep you waiting! My kind of spot! I ordered the fish and chips! It was delicious! My husband ordered the croissant French toast and he demolished it! The servers were pleasant and the food came out very quickly and was prepared wonderfully!"}
{"text":"This place was really good! I got the chicken and waffles and the strawberry butter is delicious and I didn't even need syrup. I also got some cheese grits which were good.. but definitely needed salt and pepper. With the chicken they serve hot syrup.. I think is what it's called. But it's hot sauce and syrup and it is amazing with the chicken. I added more hot sauce to mine though. And they give you half a chicken with the meal. The service was amazing and the manager came a checked on us multiple times making sure we got all our food which was appreciated. I would definitely come back to try the eggs Benedict next!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best food in Nevada hands down!!! I had the meatloaf and holy crap it was delicious and tasted just like home (NJ) the staff was friendly our waitress was the best!!!! You guys would be foolish not to eat at this place!"}
{"text":"A wonderful dinner with good variety.   Went for breakfast.   The huevos rancheros were unique.   They were on a large flower tortilla.  Cut like large nachos.  Although inventive, I did not enjoy it was much as the original on a corn tortilla.   Was not my favorite and it was difficult to eat.  However, the corn beef hash was very good.  The biscuits were also excellent.   Next time will have to get the biscuits and gravy and leave the rancheros to the Mexican restaurants.   The coffee was perfect."}
{"text":"Will definitely be going again! A friend bought my husband and I a gift card here. It was our first visit and it was nothing short of great. Upon arriving we were prompted to wait but not long after we're sat at a booth. Jocelyn greeted us shortly after. Service was amazing, food was super fresh and good portions, and although it was busy they handled it very well."}
{"text":"I have probably been here six or seven times now. The food is always spot on, some of the best breakfast in town. Service is always fantastic as well, says a lot about the management. If ever in doubt on what to order, go with the biscuits and gravy....fanfreakintastic!!! And then go hit the stairclimber for about three hours."}
{"text":"Great food! Usually very busy, but worth the wait if you don't mind. We have a small child so we do carry out."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst breakfastes we have ever had.  There were two of us and we were overcharged for the meal..  Two eggs, homefries and toast.  We were charged 9.49 each when it should have been 7.49 as we did not have any meats.  I told the waitress but she said that was the price.  i looked the menu up on line and found that she was wrong.  The toast was hardly toasted and the butter was frozen.  the potatoes were not cooked through and still had the skin on.  All in all NOT good."}
{"text":"Great food, Friendly staff  We were looking for a new breakfast spot since one of favorites had closed.  We also heard a rumor that one of our favorite servers from another place was moonlighting here.  We were pleasantly surprised with the menu selection and portions.  Our 5 yr old fell in love with the biscuits and gravy. My favorite is the meat lovers omelet. Our favorite Server John A. was there and welcomed us warmly.  He is always friendly and attentive and has a joke or silly story to share. We are usually there for breakfast and John always tries to push the cobbler. We finally went for dinner, the chicken and waffles is amazing, the Shrimp and grits are delicious and so is the peach cobbler.  I recommend for breakfast, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Made a second visit here this past weekend.  It was early afternoon so we went for lunch this time.  I went for the Bold City Burger (described as: Provel cheese, caramelized onions, bacon, sausage, fried jalape√±os and garlic aioli on a brioche bun) with onion rings.  I was really looking forward to this delicious-sounding burger, which I asked to be cooked to medium.  Unfortunately it came out very well done, which was a crying shame as it was otherwise pretty tasty.  The patty itself was undersalted, but luckily it was mashed up right against the sausage patty the burger comes with, which helped out in the seasoning department and was a nice addition.  The fried jalapenos were cold and devoid of heat, though they tasted good.  I didn't notice any caramelized onions, but I asked for raw onion in lieu of the tomato that normally comes on the burger, so they may have skipped the caramelized ones.  Can't have TOO much flavor on one burger, I guess?  I dunno.  All the elements of a delicious burger were here, but the overcooking just killed it.  Really disappointing for something that should work.  I asked our server prior to ordering how their onion rings are, as I fancy myself an onion ring connoisseur.  He said they were really good, and made in-house.  I'm dubious.  First, the batter was picture perfect, which sounds nice, but for house-made onion rings I expect a crackly, craggy crust.  These didn't have that.  Second, the onions themselves had almost no bite to them, indicating that they were frozen, which causes ice to puncture the cell walls of the onion and results in a mushy final product.  Finally, the onion rings were lukewarm.  I ordered them in spite of myself, having seen a bunch of onion rings hanging out in a 1/9 pan on the line while we were waiting for a table.  I'd hoped that when I ordered, they'd fry a fresh batch, but no such luck.  Also, they needed salt.  I had high hopes for our return visit, but was even more disappointed this time than the last."}
{"text":"Perfect fried chicken!  We also tried the special - Chicken Tender Salad. Crisp and refreshing. Great service. Darla was awesome!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a seminar and staying with a friend. The friend brought me to this cool place, and I'm glad he did! The menu choices were phenomenal, yummy food, ambiance was hip yet retro, very clean and staff super friendly. I had the buffalo chicken salad and my friend ordered the French Dip with chips. Everything is handmade in this restaurant, from my buffalo sauce to the delicious chips on Mikes plate. Both our meals were fantastic and the service excellent and oh so friendly. A definite \"must return \" when back in Vegas"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and staff. Our waitress was very patient and took her time explaining the different dishes in the menu. I was pleased with the service and food quality. The portions are big and the food was very tasty. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My husband ask me if I wanted to have breakfast at the newly opened Metro Diner on Serene.  I replied, I have to check the restaurant on Yelp if they have something new and interesting.  The pictures convinced me to go, so we did.  When we entered the restaurant at around 9am there were only 2 people.  The host said just pick a table.  First, we ordered our drinks.  I ordered orange juice and I liked it coz it's freshly squeezed (not water down).  We checked the menu and my husband ordered 3 stacks of pancakes with peaches, caramel and walnut topping.  I ordered eggs benedict with hash brown.  When our order came I was surprised with the nice food presentation.  When we taste the food we really, really love it.  Oh btw, while waiting for our food people started coming in.    I like it that the Manager went to our table and ask about our food experience.  We replied, food is awesome!  She said we can ask for her next time we visit."}
{"text":"Want to thank Gabe and staff for making our 4 Star experience a 5 Star one.  They went out of their way to make us feel welcome and valued after a delay getting service. Most establishments would just move on but Gabe and staff took it as a learning opportunity to make service better WHILE making me and my family feel valued. Food is excellent and very tasty. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Every employee we came in contact with was happy to be there and happy to be a part of our excellent breakfast. You could tell they all worked as a team. This helped set the stage for a great breakfast. Sausage gravy and biscuits was my choice and it was delicious.  Creamy but not to heavy gravy on fresh biscuits with another 10\"plate filled with hash browns and 2 scrambled eggs. No lunch required for this particular day.  Would I go back? Absolutely. Would I recommended it to friends? Absolutely. A great meal with excellent service at a value price!"}
{"text":"I like this place. This is the second time here. I like the service, today Javier was our waiter today. He was so attentive to taking care of us and letting us know what is good or what the specials were. I had the Huevos Rancheros. They were good but lacked potatoes. I think the dish needs to come with potatoes or hash browns. I ordered someone the side. I will be back on my next visit to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I can't understand how this place has such great reviews. I had the pork tenderloin and it was awful."}
{"text":"The most important thing I can say about this place is - WOW!  People/service - excellent.  You can tell that everybody from the greeters to the servers to the kitchen to the bussers to the management are motivated, display urgency, and show that they understand and care that the customers coming in are the lifeblood of the business.  The food is excellent for a self-proclaimed \"diner\" - you can get your breakfast classics, varied specials, as well as their own custom concoctions (Charleston Shrimp & Grits, Holy Davoli burger, etc.).  Check out their menu online if you're curious.  My fave right now is still the corned beef hash breakfast.  They roast the corned beef there themselves, and it's just fantastic - savory, juicy, everything it should be.  Anyway, you should go.  Seriously, just do yourself a favor and do it.  You won't be disappointed.  Not because I can read your mind, but because they truly care about what they do there and will make sure you love it."}
{"text":"First the service was amazing however, the chicken and waffles were absolutely delicious. Skin was nice and flakey and the meat just as juicy. I definitely will be coming back again to try more things. (Big portions)"}
{"text":"Love the place up until now I loved the food, today I got the chicken salad salad even bought extra chicken salad I saw it was fat in it before I left didn't think nothing I just put in a napkin and threw it away. Got home ready to chow down and every dang bite was fat nothing but fat fat fat fat. I was so disgusted after 3 bites I gave up and packed it up.  I will be returning it in the morning I'm upset I didn't even get to eat."}
{"text":"There are times when the country girl in me comes out ! Those times call for comfort food and Carrie Underwood songs on repeat....ask me how many times I've listened to \"Church Bells\" back to back . You would be surprised!   The portions here are so big! That is why I needed to come here at least twice to get the scoop on the new diner in the city. Las Vegas doesn't have too many diners so Metro Diner coming to town was a welcomed treat!   My first trip I was drawn to the chicken and waffles with the strawberry butter! This entree could easily be shared. I ended up taking half of the chicken home . The chicken was crunchy and the waffles were fresh! I could tell these were not Eggos there was no freezer taste to them . In the syrup they put a little Louisiana hot sauce to give it a sweet and savory kick to it.  I would definitely get these again!   I was full but not too full for dessert so we ordered the salted caramel brownie. It had drizzled chocolate and caramel syrup topped with some vanilla ice cream.   Today I went for the Shrimp and Grits for some southern comfort . This meal sticks too your bones. It would be perfect for a cold winter day. We don't see those type of days often so I ate it when it was 111 degrees outside . It was still good! The gravy was rich with pieces of crispy bacon, shrimp, andoule sausage, peppers, mushrooms, and green onions. In the middle a short stack of crispy grits. This can also be shared because of the portion size. It's bigger then what you would get at Lola's.  I ate everything around it and took the rest home because I had to save room for dessert.   We had the apple cobbler which had thick apple slices in it. You could tell it was fresh because the apples were not soggy or overly soft.   The staff is super friendly and the food is a good value for what you get. If you want breakfast for dinner they serve breakfast all day! My only wish is that they made Fried green tomatoes!"}
{"text":"came here for the first time it was delicious...big portions and good pricing... great service... and great food is a plus for my fam and I. Also the earlier you go the better if not get ready for a wait time... it gets pretty busy for lunch andthey have breakfast.. lunch and dinner all day!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure to experience a catered lunch from Metro Diner.  The chicken pot pie was perfect as was the fried chicken.  Salads were wonderful as well.....thank you from all if us @Paragon Bank. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Great food especially the chicken and waffles and I think they have the best fried chicken in town and great service and big portions"}
{"text":"Our first time at Metro Diner was amazing to say the least. The hostesses were welcoming & got us seated quickly. Our server, Javier, was truly remarkable. He was so friendly & efficient! We had the Crab Cakes Benedict & the Chicken & Waffles.  It was delicious!! Everything was flavorful & it was definitely the best comfort food I've ever had in my life! If you're contemplating coming to eat here, DO IT! You won't regret it one bit!"}
{"text":"This place has its pros and cons.    First of all, service here is superb.  The server never left us with empty cups and the manager even touched tables which I believe its important.    We ordered the shrimp and grits and the chicken and waffles.  It came out fast, maybe around 10 minutes.   The portions are huge!! Price is around $15 for entrees.  So presentation was beautiful.  The chicken was crispy and so were the waffles.  It comes with a hot sauce syrup that the server makes to order in front of you.  I suggest you try tobasco with syrup instead.  I liked that combo! The waffle also comes with a strawberry butter which was tasty.  The chicken was nice and crispy but i think the fryer oil needed a change because it was dark and i could taste the difference.  I used to fry chicken everyday at work and I know when the oil is bad.  But it was good!  The shrimp and grits were also delicious.  The grits are not the loose kind, its actually a grits cake.  The shrimp was not rubbery at all.    We spent a total of $40 for our meals with drinks.  We will be returning for french toast and crab cakes next time."}
{"text":"Very Busy , Very Very Overpriced , Food is Average at Best .. dont see the big deal , NC will never understand The true Meanings oF diners,  Closes at 9pm which sucks .. Diners should be 24/7 but here restaurants in Charlotte are scared of the Zombies after 10pm ... My favorite Diner is Midnight Diner Near Uptown Charlotte,  This chain Place blows"}
{"text":"Excellent ! The service and food were top notch. I also love that you can get breakfast any time of the day. Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"A cute and relaxed atmosphere.I got the American cheeseburger with mashed red skinned potatoes. It was cooked, like I asked, medium rare and it tasted fine.The potatoes, a huge serving, enough for 2 or 3 people, were good.I took most of them home. I got the cobbler of the day, peach, served with a,scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was good, took most of IT  home. The very best part of my first visit was my server, Angelica. She was great!!! Next time, I will order breakfast ,"}
{"text":"Everybody still in training mode it must be.   Extremely expensive eggs. Close to 8 bucks for 2 eggs. They told me the hash browns are shredded potatoes the picture on the menu shows potatoes cut up. This is going to be a play by play review.   We'll see pictures wife's pot pie veggies not all the way cooked thru , my links were supposed to be well done they came almost uncooked.  I will go no further except to say they compensated my meal.   So they may be worth a second try in the future now that I know what to order.  Avery was very good a great server.   My wife and I said that my granddaughters food was the best.   She had gravy and biscuits.   They do have military discount don't care how much but proud to have one. Sorry picture of wife's was not in there.   All the people were great and friendly. Might try a diner someday."}
{"text":"They do a pretty good job here. The wait staff seems well trained and the food comes in pretty large portion size and is usually pretty fresh. There tends to frequently be a wait...which I suppose speaks to their quality.  The negatives: significantly over priced. Also every time I have ever been in Metro there has been a smell of something burning that hits you as you walk through the door. It is also pretty loud when it is crowded and they are not super fast. I would recommend though, as overall I think they do a good job"}
{"text":"Ive personally been at your newest location three times , once with my husband, 2nd and most memorable was with a group of my buddies and we all retired from restaurants as waitresses. We had so much fun, we did have to wait for a few minutes but that was not Metros fault, it was all our buddies straggling in. There was 6 of us. We were seated and her came our server, Laura M. what a kick, friendly and very knowledgeable and very professional. We never disclosed the fact we were all old time waitresses. We just waited to see how we were treated, normally a bunch of women are not the best tippers.Our food was fabulous, a couple of ladies had salads, One had Chicken, a couple had breakfast and one had a cheeseburger. Hot and yummy. Our server Laura interacted with us even though quite busy.  Glad youre here Metro..Dynamite.  Our 3rd trip in was another mixed group, they all liked it and will be back, unfortunately didnt get her name this time, but service was great and a very sociable server also. I think her name was Wanda. It shoukld be noted my Brother and his wife have also been here numerous times also..And we will all be back.. Congratulations fine and fun Diner."}
{"text":"1/2 chicken and waffles and sausage gravy/ biscuit breakfast, on a Friday.  Sat at the kitchen bar.  Mercedes was our sweet server.  But I think because we sat here we didn't get complete attention paid to our little order.  They ran food out from the window next to us.  But they made up for it in apologizing.  And correcting the issues, which ended up being good customer service.  One concern was that the line cook would touch raw meat with his gloves and then take the pancakes off the grill with the same gloves and touch for doneness and then place them on the plate with the same raw meat gloves instead of the spatula."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good so is the service. Today I ordered the chopped Salisbury Steak. While the food tasted good, the steak was not chopped and did not come with most of the items listed. Again the food was good, however the chopped steak was basically a large burger without the bun. A bit disappointed when I realized I ordered a bun less burger with gravy."}
{"text":"Great place new and different  Referencing A place with southern flavor and hospitality  Friendly Fast and professional service with great management     finally a place for breakfast in Henderson welcome to our community"}
{"text":"This is our go-to breakfast spot in Vegas and we're here just about every weekend despite the fact that we live in CA. It's the hubb's favorite because 'they've perfected hash browns' (wth?!) - gotta love my simple guy but his take just doesn't do this place justice.  They've got unique menu options and specials that you just don't find at other places (check their menu out & you'll see what I mean), especially diners, and their portions are HUGE!    Their chicken & waffles is absolutely scrumptious!!! Not only is it too much to consume in a single sitting, more importantly, it surprisingly rivals Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles in So Cal (which is a favorite & must for me when in So Cal), but for different reasons. That homemade strawberry butter is HEAVEN on fluffy waffles; coupled with their unique mustard brined something or other juicy fried chicken - it's the perfect combo of sweet & salty but not too salty (yes mustard, which I avoid & was skeptical about - but it doesn't taste mustardy & gives it its own unique flavor).  And I didn't even add OR NEED TO add the sweet & spicy sauce that comes with it (I don't do condiments or spicy...I know I know, what a bland existence).  For a healthier option, their avocado toast is refreshing chunky avocado spread with fresh tomato quarters on multigrain toast - simple, light yet tasty as well as filling. It inspired me to make it at home, which for some reason is only a close second.  Or if you're lucky enough to order it & breakfast desert is your thing (like my son) - try the Cinnamon Roll Pancakes. Sweet mother of tastebuds!! Delicious & fluffy buttery pancake sweetness with crunchy caramel walnut overload!!  Everything sounds & looks good from their menu, I want to try to all but have so enjoyed what I've ordered in the past, it's hard not to order those items again.  Maybe one of these days we'll actually try their lunch or dinner options.  This place is popular & fills up fast but they're great about getting you seated & served quickly, and they have an outdoor patio with heaters as well. Service has always been excellent with the manager making his rounds just to check on you. Your server takes your order on an iPad & sends it right to the cook while standing in front of you - how's that for fast?  An when you're ready to pay, you do so with your server again through the iPad - super fast & convenient.  My not-so-perfect comments/observations:  1. Yes, the ladies bathroom is a bit messy (not gross or nasty though) more often than not; and  2. On my last visit I was seated facing the cooks. I couldn't help but notice & wonder why the cook wasn't wearing a hair net despite having a really great fro. I kept wondering if I should be checking my food for hair when I receive it (I have long curly hair & know for a fact curly hair falls out like you wouldn't believe). Note to manager: he's got a really great fro but please make him wear a hair net so I don't need to counsel myself. Thank you. Keep serving up deliciousness. That is all."}
{"text":"Eat here all the time because it's delicious and has great service. On the weekends I order when leaving the gym and pick up on my way home. Order is always perfect. Give this place a shot for any meal and you're setting yourself up for complete satisfaction"}
{"text":"Went there with friends who were excited to tell me that they have a Monte Cristo sandwich!  I love those, but they have no clue how to prepare them.  It should be ham, turkey, swiss on bread that is egg dipped and deep fried then sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Side for added flavor is either maple syrup or a sweet jelly/jam such as strawberry.  Well,  they got the ham, turkey and cheese ok (but not much of it) and the bread was like almost a whole loaf!  It was deep fried but you though you were eating slightly flavored bread.  They provided some sort of a berry \"dip\" to spread but overall it couldn't hold a candle to New York Deli (that burned down 10 years ago) or the Pine Tree Restaurant of Spring Mountain that CLOSED two years ago.  Short version... there's no where in Southern Nevada that knows how to make a Monte Cristo.  Part two...my wife had the bar-b-que sandwich which was ok BUT...they provided their version of a bar-b-que sauce that was the color, consistency and FLAVOR of catsup with a little bit of pickle in it.  She ate the sandwich but the sauce was a waste of time.  Service was very good but that's all this place had going for it.    Our one, and only, trip there."}
{"text":"2nd visit I walk in with a new business partner. The minute I walk in the hostess said to me \"There is a 15-20 minute wait. Surprised she didn't say hello or welcome to..... Anyway we waiting for about 10 minutes then she said  there is a table of 6 with 2 men on the end that don't mind if you join them. It was lunch time and we didn't have much time to kill. So, we sat down and both had the chicken salad that was amazing.  The waiter asked what we would like for drinks. We both said unsweetened iced tea. Waiter says we don't have any tea. Ugh no seats no tea. Tip : train your people on introductions, just saying. Good food busy lunch"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner on a Sunday night where they had many employees training. No problem with that. My husband ordered the Cajun pasta in which he loved , really tasty. I ordered the meatloaf w/ mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were really good and freshly made. The meatloaf was spongy as if it had too much breading in it and salty. The service was different as many people came to our table. Overall good"}
{"text":"First time at this iconic diner and we weren't disappointed. My wife had the three cheese grilled cheese, my son the Monte Cristo and I the metro Party melt... All where cooked to perfection and taste great.  We will be coming back"}
{"text":"My wife & I went to this location late on a Saturday night. It was slow, but we were EXTREMELY well taken care of by our waiter. Jonathan was awesome.  He talked my wife into trying the Chicken & waffles, which she enjoyed. I had the club sandwich, which was also on point.  Great place & great atmosphere. And again, Jonathan was great."}
{"text":"I love it here! The staff is friendly and they have great customer service. They don't leave you hanging at the front waiting for a seat; there's someone there to talk to you and make you feel welcome. The portions are big and the food is delicious so come hungry!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Food is amazing. Staff is amazing. Wish the location was better but the food is worth going to where ever they are to get it. Go check it out. Have the breakfast pie, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"This is my second time placing a to go order from here. Today I called in to order a \"Croissant Sandwich and Soup\" which is located under the Soups & such section. I ordered a ham and cheddar sandwich with soup, however the lady I spoke to on the phone said they only had breakfast croissant sandwiches. This item is clearly on the menu, if you don't serve it why leave it on your menu. Perhaps the lady I talked to is unaware of the full menu. I ended up ordering the regular half sandwich with cheddar and broccoli soup."}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles I've had in a long time. Gotta take the family here for breakfast. Quick service and very accommodating."}
{"text":"My family came here for breakfast today for the first. Very impressed for their services. Our waiter was attentive and fast! Also they had great team work from the hostess to the runners. Foods was great and they give Sooooo much foods for the prices. We really enjoyed it and will be back."}
{"text":"I kind of don't even want to tell you about this place, keep it to myself.  As an old-school breakfast diner, it's as good as it gets.  So if you are expecting something else (like a place that specializes in egg white omelettes with basil, a thin slice of avocado and an aoli with finesse), this isn't it.  If you want old school eggs and taters and pancakes, then this is where to go.  My wife had beef patty and eggs combo breakfast.  I tried her beef patty, it was properly cooked, good quality beef, generous size, and seasoned nicely.  I stole a second bite.  She said it was one of the best diner breakfasts she has had, and they handled her eggs the way she asked them to without having to ask twice.  I had Huevos Rancheros.  They were unorthodox, but the best I have ever had, period, and I have been all over northern Mexico, Arizona, New Mex, California.  Just try them.  The coffee was rich and hot and the service person kept it coming, along with friendly and competent service all around.  Yeah I kind of don't even want to tell you guys about this one, but they deserve success so I'll add my two cents."}
{"text":"Great local gem! Off the beaten path. Super friendly staff, great service and yummy choices. The sweet and spicy syrup mixture offered with the chicken & waffles was surprisingly indulgent. This is a keeper for me."}
{"text":"First off I have to thank you for opening up down the street from my house. I really enjoyed the feel of the restaurant. The diner style counter top makes it easy for me to come by myself if needed. The service is quick and staff is friendly. The real highlight for me was the chicken and waffles with strawberry butter. Crispy, juicy, and flavorful chicken with the right hot sauce on the side! I'll most likely be a regular since I wanna try the entire menu. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"On Wednesday Jan 31, 2018 my wife and went to Metro Diner on Stephanie. We were greeted and sat quickly. Within a few moments our server came over. Her name was Melissa. I just want to say that the service she provided was excellent!! That is why i gave this place 5 stars. She took our food order, food came out quickly, hot and very tasty. Melissa made sure our drinks were full, and everything was ok.  Over all the experience was excellent! Good job to all the staff at Metro Diner"}
{"text":"Every thing was freaking delicious!  Country Fried Steak Special=bomb.com Crab Cake Benny pretty flavorful and yummy!  Ill be back"}
{"text":"Was not impressed.  I ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy as the side.  I'm pretty sure the salt container was dumped in the breading on the pork.  It could have been the best part, but it was inedible.  The mashed potatoes and gravy could have very well been from last week.  I'm pretty sure the grapefruit juice was something other than grapefruit juice, since the root beer was Dr. Pepper.  But hey, the husband loved his eggs, sausage and hash browns.  I won't be making a second visit."}
{"text":"My friend and I come in here at least once a week, and we love it! Dario was the first waiter we ever had, and he as been very helpful with suggestions each time. We try to pick something new each visit, but the fried chicken, and the philly are still two of my favorites. Very clean, and wait times are not too long."}
{"text":"If you go here, please try the chicken and waffles. I'm not sure how they make the chicken so crispy and delicious even I rave about it (not the biggest fried chicken fan, see), but they do.  The wait staff is always excellent and fun and friendly, and the level of comfort in their comfort food is beyond compare."}
{"text":"Don't leave many 5 stars, if any, however, this was a truly remarkable experience. Enjoyed my Charleston shrimp and grits, (1/2 order) tasty, ample, flavored, everything you could want. the Banana Foster Cheesecake was delicious. Ample parking, great location.  Darla G, our server, was great !!!, answered questions, provided commentary on dishes, etc. Will be back !!!!"}
{"text":"This is my and Daughter favor Breakfast diner in Matthews NC. Great customer service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Try the Yo Hala French toast! Very good and worth every penny. Friendly staff and fast tasty food."}
{"text":"We were first time customers and we appreciated the friendly greeting from all the staff. My eggs, bacon and pancakes were very good. I did notice, however, that they wanted to charge extra for any cheese or onions on the hash browns. My wife had the crab Benedict and it tasted strangely like tuna!  Service and coffee were good. We'll eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm always here but tonight I saw an exceptional waiter. He was't our server but I wish he was His name was Darius! He mesmerized me with his Quick Service friendly attitude and infectious smile. Coming from a family of restauranttours, customer service is key for me. Our server wasn't a bad server either. Our food was great as usual and I tried something new tonight. The \"pot roast\" and my daughter had the delicious shrimp and grits. There was a bus boy that was incredible doing his job. Sometimes as customers we overlook the smallest things, but I pay attention to details and that was a detail that could not be overlooked. Overall we had a great experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious!! I had the Chicken w/French Toast (substituted the waffles) .. Huge portion of food. I'm not sure of what type of batter they use for the fried chicken but OMG  Crispy and flavorful on the outside and Juicy on the inside.  I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"METRO DINER YES! I went about a week ago, party of two on a Saturday afternoon! This place was popping! There was a short wait about 10 mins but it wasn't a big deal, we got seated and our drink order was taken efficiently. The hostess explained the run down, they have a black board with daily specials that change each day from featured menu items to drink options.   Their menu is actually quite the expansive one! There was so many choices it kinda gets hard to choose what you want!   Our server was nice and helped us through the menu, what their more popular items are and since we were seated in an area that wasn't visible to the blackboard he told us what the featured items were.   We took a minute or two to figure out what we wanted. We finally decided on ordering chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy and the corned beef hash with poached eggs.   Though the place was busy, our server was attentive and he had great customer service! He was easy to talk to and was funny!   It did take a while to get our food which would be the only down side to our experience but I have to say it was worth the wait!!   Once our food arrived our server checked on us and made sure everything was good. I loved that the manager made an effort to go to each table to ensure their experience was to the best of their ability!   Customer service, food quality and overall experience was excellent! The wait time from ordering to receiving food could use some work but you can't rush good food!"}
{"text":"First time my boyfriend and I have ever been and we were very impressed and satisfied with the service and food. Good home cooking. Mac and cheese made right, meatloaf moist, mashed potatoes and gravy perfect. Our waitress was very sweet as well. Even management was great. We will definitely come back and try breakfast and dinner. Curious to see what the chicken and waffles and shrimp and grits are about."}
{"text":"What can I say other than this place is: Amazing.  Omg. Great tasting, filling, and pleasurable comfort food.  Came to see my parents that live here across the street, saw this place on Yelp so we gave it a try. Super glad we did.   My mom who eats out all the time said this is the best breakfast she's ever had. I also travel a lot around the country and eat out and Metro has to be on my Top 5 now.  Reason is the food is great as well as the service.   THE FOOD:  We got three dishes: Biscuits and Gravy, Corn Beef Hash and eggs and Fried Chicken and Waffles. All three were phenomenal. Seriously. I was impressed.   Their Biscuits and Gravy blew my dad away. And he's a picky person. Very fresh biscuits, with a rich flavorful topping of gravy.  The Corn Beef Hash is made in house. Super fresh and good. Went perfect with the poached eggs.  My Chicken and Waffles were freaking good. Perfectly battered chicken with fresh, soft waffles. Got to mix the syrup and hot sauce just right to get the right final touch!   THE SERVICE:  Monica was our server.  She is super hip and cool. Lot of energy and very attentive to your needs and attention to detail. We never had to ask for anything. She recommended the Chicken and Waffles. Glad she did!   The the ladies up front were also very warm and friendly as soon as we walked in. As someone who works in the industry I know how hard this is to do on a daily basis: to put on that smile and be warm and friendly with the guests. Sometimes it can be discouraging for them seeing the severs make all the tips they do, but hopefully get appreciated in other ways and continue the warm greetings.   Definitely recommend coming here for a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast today and glad I did. This place has some amazing food. I went to the old on Tropicana and now this one. Still great tasting and quality.   THE FOOD. You can pretty much get anything you want on the menu and customize it to your liking. Their system to do that with their iPad is efficient and accommodating. I ended up getting the Corn Beef Hash and Eggs. Super good. Quality Corn Beef Hash.   Also got the 1/2 Cheeseburger Benedict and 1/2 Crab Cake Benedict. The Cheeseburger was better nevertheless they both were amazing. Super filling and generous with the portions here. Everything here was fresh and made to order.   THE SERVICE. Dang, I wouldn't want to be a cook here during the busy rush!  The way Nick was calling out the orders and running the line like a boss was cool to see but a lot of pressure for the cooks. If you want to have a quiet relaxing breakfast don't sit at the bar like we did during the rush haha. I totally appreciate tho the fast and efficient service we got from the kitchen and Hillary our server. She was so nice and professional. But none of the cooks buckled under pressure. They just kept going snd pumping the food out.   I can see why this place is so successful. Its run like a well oiled machine from the greeters to the servers all helping each other to the kitchen. Would highly recommend coming here for breakfast or brunch!"}
{"text":"It's Christmas Eve. I really want to try this place and I'm going to go to another location now. I was surprised at how backed up they were considering there were not a lot of people eating. I sat at the bar and I heard the wait staff discussing the that the manager had left. A chef had to ask the waitstaff to ask me for my drink order. Nobody helped me as far as ordering my food. I walked out instead of waiting and hoping they would improve my service. There was no manager present anyway.  Update! I went to the second location, and they decided to close around 2PM today. I hope I find another restaurant serving breakfast that's still open today."}
{"text":"Our server Linnet was super friendly! Had chicken and waffles-YUM! The manager was very nice and checked in with us. Very nice experience :)"}
{"text":"My first time going to the Metro diner as I'm from East Tennessee, but I had ordered the Famous Chicken and Waffles as I have never had it before AND IT WAS DELICIOUS! The strawberry Butter on the waffles were great. The bathroom was a little dirty but overall a great selection."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles is delicious. The chicken could use a bit more seasoning, but that is an easy fix. The spicy syrup is delicious  I wasn't a big fan of the croissant French toast but their regular French toast is decent. My mom wasn't a fan of her pastrami sandwich so we tend to stick to breakfast. May try other stuff one day. Large portions enough to share with my munchkins so I like that. A definite go-to for my family for breakfast. Always friendly staff and service A+"}
{"text":"First visit here and very satisfied! The decor and atmosphere are great. The restaurant was clean and service was good. I had a turkey melt sandwich and hubby had tomato bisque and half sandwich all of which were good. The side salad was a bit pricey at $3.99 for what it was but other than that we enjoyed it and will likely return."}
{"text":"Decent diner with friendly service. Most dishes are pretty tasty. Taking away a star because their sandwiches aren't the best. They use far too much butter on the grilled bread."}
{"text":"Service is excellent. Food is amazing. I go to Roscoe almost every time I go to LA. I say I like chicken waffle at Metro Diner more. I love strawberry butter and the server mixed hot sauce and syrup together to make the hot and sweet sauce, it's bomb. The Holly Davoli sandwich is amazing. I love grilled cheese so that got me. Bold City burger is good as well. I love spicy and that fried jalapeno just made it right."}
{"text":"Great location, lots of parking, breakfast served all day, and classic American Diner food.....loved it all!!!  4 stars instead of 5 because food service is very slow!  Very friendly and attentive, but food delivery is SLOW!  The self-serve beverage station is also very cool!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience this morning. I tried their chicken and waffles and it was the bomb! We also had the ham and corned beef hash but overall I think the best was the chicken and waffles! It was cooked well and the seasoning was just right! The staff was so friendly and were quick with refilling drinks! Definitely coming back! A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were visiting Vegas for the week.  We decided we wanted to go on a little road trip so we went out in search of a 7-Eleven. We totally found metro diner on accident and it was one of the best food finds we had all week. It worked out because we didn't want to be stuck eating strip food or buffet. We went in for breakfast and had a basic eggs and hash browns breakfast with a side of biscuits and gravy because we never get that at home. We were so impressed with the food quality and customer service we decided to return every day for breakfast, trying something new each time.   On our second day of breakfast with some yo halla halla and croissant French toast we were even more impressed, our wonderful server told us that it was a chain and started in Jacksonville. Which made us super happy being from the east coast. After looking on the website we found a location an hour away from home ok the east coast.   This place had the best breakfast and customer service and we look forward to visiting the ones on the east coast!!!"}
{"text":"The food and service was the best I've had in a very long time. I recommend Metro Dinner to anyone that needs to be saved.. Service was top dollar. My server was Stephen was by far the best. And the price was well worth every penny. I recommend the pulled pork Mac stack, Trust me!!!"}
{"text":"Great service. The blackened chicken is delicious. We tried the shrimp and grits as well, and it has been the best of the few places I've tried. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in town.  Our Waitress Darla was great. She remembers me every time  I go there.  (She even seats me at my \"favorite table\") everyone is friendly, courteous and very responsive. The service is quick and you cannot best the prices!  I highly recommend this place.  I have not had one dish I did like like.  #Darlarules"}
{"text":"HEY METRO DINER!!!     How about puting prices in your menu when people click on your \"ONLINE MENU\" so we know what your prices are like?   Dumb idea huh??"}
{"text":"I love this place! Staff is so nice and the portions are huge! It was defiantly busy but my water was full the entire time. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Metro Diner is one of the newest chains to land on Las Vegas soil. Achieving its third month of business, this is the fourth Metro Diner to open in the Las Vegas valley.     After hiking on the Seven Hills trail system, my brother and I were undecided on where to eat. Then I recalled that there was a new Metro Diner down the street. Both my brother and I appreciate the burgers that Metro Diner serves. So off we went to Metro Diner for a post-hiking dinner. It would be my second visit to a Metro Diner.    This Metro Diner is located in the Eastern Beltway Shopping Center which is the power center that includes a hyper busy Walmart Super Center, Home Depot, Sam's Club, and Petco. It also includes one of the most dysfunctional and dangerous parking lots in Las Vegas made worse by a serious need for a traffic signal at its Serene Avenue exits. Fortunately, Metro Diner is closer to Spencer Street than Eastern Avenue which eliminated much of the aggravation of having to drive through a  dysfunctional and dangerous parking lot. We'd leave the car in a parking space equidistant from the Walmart Center g.m. entrance to the pod where Metro Diner is.    Upon walking inside Metro Diner, the man up front told us to sit anywhere. There wasn't much of a greeting at the same time that nobody told us about the specials on the board. This is a totally different experience from the experience that I had at the Rainbow Road Metro Diner in September, where the man stepped outside to welcome me to the diner before my waitress told me about the specials. Here, our waitress arrived a few minutes later with the three page menus. I thought that our waitress was nice at the same time that she could of used more training. Just like a badly needed traffic light is missing at the Serene Avenue exits, so was my badly needed Coke Zero refill. Nobody inquired about the Coke Zero refills. Then for the first time that I can recall dining out, the waitress gave us the wrong check. Obviously, I felt that there is some room for improvement in service.     As far as the burger there is zero need for improvement. In my opinion this chain ought to be named Metro Burger and Breakfast. When I quickly perused the three page menu that includes lunch and dinner plates, breakfast, and sandwiches I decided on the burger. For $10.99 I ordered the Bacon, Mushroom, and Swiss Burger medium done with French Fries. For an additional $2.99, I ordered a glass of Coke Zero. If Walmart in the parking lot's motto is \"Save Money and Live Better,\" Metro Diner's motto could be \"Spend money and live better.\" The thick and juicy burger melting with Hickory smoked bacon, sauteed mushrooms, and Swiss cheese was delicious. It tasted as if I was eating a burger right off the BBQ grill. And in contrast to some restaurants, the mushrooms did not appear to be from a Green Giant can. The tasty French fries sharing the plate with the burger tasted home made. Following this review are two pictures of the Bacon, Mushroom, and Swiss Burger. Just a warning, You might get hungry.   In conclusion, I am a fan of their Bacon, Mushroom, and Swiss Burger. On a scale of 1 to 5 stars, my return factor to this Metro Diner is 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious food every time I go!  Great service too. Fast. Friendly and a pleasant atmosphere!  I have had breakfast and lunch here. The Veggie wrap is my favorite!"}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite new spots. I love the diner feel (the restaurant feels like it's been there for years and I love that feeling), the food is very classic diner food (filling, fair-priced, and filled with love) and they serve everything on the menu all day long.  Coming from the Midwest, I've been able to enjoy many diners and I guess I didn't realize I was missing those experiences until I walked through the door of Metro Diner. The waitress greeted us with a smile, the restaurant smells like pancakes and coffee, and I left full and happy. Those are a few things that really make a diner a quality one for me.  I chose to have the Metro Pancake, a 12\" thick, fluffy pancake. I tricked it out with bananas baked in and chocolate chips on top. It was worth the price, even though I only finished 2/3 of it. I also can't wait to go back and have the meatloaf dinner because that looked amazing coming out of the kitchen, as did the avocado toast.   I am very much looking forward to coming back here. I can't wait to bring friends for breakfast. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Got in about 2:00 at the end of the lunch rush after shoe shopping with my lovely bride. Self served a cup of coffee and a couple minutes later got seated in the main room. Started with a mimosa to cloud my judgement on the meatloaf and MLB asked for decaf and chicken pot pie. Hard to mess up diner-style meatloaf and Metro plays it straight: very good, nothing tricky going on here; you got meat, you got loaf, you got little bits of deliciousness in there under brown gravy with some very mashie potatoes and extra-skillety squashes. really, they are so good. Snuck a spoonful of the potpie and liked it well enough to sneak a couple more. - Portions were big enough to take some home for later. Had them cold out of the fridge in lieu of dinner and still no complaints! Dessert was a puzzle: Bananas Foster in cheesecake form? Tasted right and the cake was properly cheesey but I was hoping for warm fruits in a thick, sweet reduction with ice cream... possibly on a crepe?"}
{"text":"On our way to Reno NV were coming from Charlotte NC. We stayed the night in Henderson at the fiesta casino which was great as well. We did not want to eat at the casino so I went to yelp and found the Metro diner. We were greeted by the hostess she sat us an said waitress would be right  the specials were on chalkboard in the back of the restaurant. I had the special which there was a great amount to choose from, breakfast lunch an dinner. All day long . I had the cheeseburger Benedict. Outstanding. Chorizo little to burnt for my liking but all around was really good. My only regret was filling up on soda before my meal came. Damn you Coca Cola for tasting so good."}
{"text":"My first time dining here and already excited to come back to try other items on the menu. We tried the holy davoli burger, chicken and waffles, and banana foster cheesecake. Holy davoli burger was everything you could ever want in a burger...a burger cooked to perfection and sandwiched between 2 grilled cheese sandwiches. What more could you ask for. The chicken and waffles are definitely worth trying. 4 waffles pieces topped with strawberry butter, and half a whole chicken (4 pieces - wing, thigh, breast, and drumstick) Chicken was crispy but juicy on the inside and the waffles was light and crispy. The icing on the cake was our awesome server Shannon. She came by often to make sure we had everything we needed and was friendly from beginning to end. Found my new go to diner spot"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our sandwiches for lunch. She had the Grilled Reuben and I had the Pastrami on Rye. They were both great. Once we were seated service was excellent. We have tried to eat here previously but we're not willing to wait. Glad we finally tried this busy place!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for an early dinner. We ordered the turkey dinner with mashed potatoes & the meatloaf with mashed potions. Generous portions and we got some extra gravy for our leftovers.   Both meals were delicious & we had great service. They have a self serve beverage bar for your drink refills if they are busy.  Already checking the menu for our next visit."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Wife and I walked in on a Saturday morning and this place was jumping. They were very busy(a good sign). The hostess said it was a 15 minute wait and she was right on target. We were seated --our waiter was awesome -- very knowledgeable about the dishes -- we ordered and less than 10 minutes later two plates of heaven showed up at the table.  Wife ordered Chicken and Waffles. It was off the charts good. Josh mixed the sweet and spicy sauce -- that killed too Wife who is a tough customer said it was one of the best breakfasts she had I got the Southern Benedict -- it too was great  The Harvest blend coffee was amazing too.  This is a must eat when in Henderson."}
{"text":"Very nice little place. Food is good and service is fast and friendly. I would highly recommend giving this place a try"}
{"text":"It took some time before I was able to check out Metro Diner. I had heard a lot about it from co-workers and friends who frequent the place.  So, with that said, I have visited this location twice within a month. A couple co-workers and myself made a lunch visit and I enjoyed my breakfast sandwich and fries.  My second visit was around the Holidays with my Parents in town visiting. We headed over for Saturday breakfast. Saturday draws quite the crowd for breakfast. We waited nearly thirty minutes for our table. But, it was all good - the food is definitely worth it. I chose the breakfast pie, added bacon with a side of grits. Very good pie indeed! I described it as basically being a inside out omelet! Yum. Grits were tasty as well. They charged an extra George Washington (that's $1) to add the bacon...   They must change the menu constantly, because I couldn't find the aforementioned breakfast sandwich on the menu during the second go 'round.  Can't wait to make it back."}
{"text":"Metro Diner occupies the space at one end of the building that sits just behind Carrabbas. It would be an excellent spot if Carrabbas was not there - as it is, the location is a bit tough to see from Independence, but if you know where you are going, it's still one of the better locations in the shopping center, rather than being buried in the middle someplace.  Once inside, there are not quite as many tables as you might expect. It isn't that it's small, exactly, but it isn't expansive either, so you may need to wait a bit. One nice option is that they have an outdoor section, and that area is covered where they can even lower the siding if it's raining. However, if there is a lot of wind, it does get noisy as the flaps continuously blow in and out (and on a humid summer afternoon, it gets a bit steamy out there, since you are enclosed).  Service is very friendly, even if you sit outside, and dishes are served up quickly. The dishes are the kind that you just want to try, with most items on the menu seeming interesting just from the description. However, when delivered, many just seem to miss the mark a bit - the grits being a bit off and the waffles good but not much different than you would have at home. All good, but not great, and not quite living up to their descriptions. You do get some huge portions, though."}
{"text":"We ate at Metro Diner, first time ever and we ordered the Yo Halo on the Square and it was absolutely delicious.... when it came to the table it looked fabulous and it tasted divine.... What a great way to serve French toast and add all those extra goodies like banana and cream cheese and hazelnut and blueberries and strawberries to make this one terrific tasting breakfast, lunch or dinner item.... We will be back as I really enjoyed it sooooo much.... I Hop should learn how to make French toast that tastes half as good as this, and lets not even mention Denny's..... We will be back to try a dinner item, everything sounded so good, and I especially liked that the manager came to the table to see if we were enjoying out meal and we most certainly were.  Also our waitress Finn was so nice and explained a few of the items on the menu to us so the next time we come in we have an idea of what to order... Such a vast variety of items and each one sounded better than the next..  Will write a review when we eat dinner there to let you know how great dinner was.   Try the Metro Diner you and your tummy will be very happy...... :)"}
{"text":"Great Service and the food is wonderful. I had Beachy Eggs Benedict. Which was Spinach, Ham and Tomato. The Sauce was out of this world too.  We will be back"}
{"text":"Breakfast for dinner? Yes please!  Came in because I wanted fish & chips, so this was the nearest place to my house that served it. Totally fell for the CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. If you come here without trying the chicken waffles, did you really try Metro Diner? Lol! The chicken was so good and satisfying. The crunchy skin and the flavor was just all there. Plus, the strawberry butter went well with the meal. (Of course I asked for extra haha) Make sure they make their special sauce for any chicken dish, which is basically the syrup and Louisiana hot sauce mixed together.  The other dish we got was the SMOTHERED CHICKEN, which is on their daily special. It was okay (not as good as the chicken and waffles). It's chicken tenders smothered in melted cheese with some saut√©ed veggies.   The service: our server was so funny! & knowledgeable. I think his name was Philip. But he helped us with picking our order and he was so attentive   Overall, great experience. We'll be back again"}
{"text":"The staff here is wonderful and the food is tasty. I've only been once but really enjoyed it. I got the meatloaf dinner and my husband had the biscuits and gravy. The waitress was especially nice to our child and even brought him a small dish of strawberries to hold him over before food arrived."}
{"text":"Good food but not so great service. Have tried this place 3-4 times, and almost every time I've been here for breakfast I had to wait forever to get just one refill on coffee! They also make you feel that you can't linger a little bit--they need that table for the next customer. And it costs almost twice as much as breakfast at Mikkis where they have great service."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting our daughter and stumbled upon this place. Everything was amazing!  In our party we had the chicken and waffles ( this was for our 7 year old and they did let us get a half portion), fried chicken sandwich, rueban, and a burger. Everything was delicious and service was great!! Definitely would visit again."}
{"text":"This location is closed. Signs are gone, windows covered over. Gone. Are there a few times and thought it was a little over the top for a local joint. The portion sizes are best for the Las Vegas strip, not the little neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"This is the new third location of Metro Diner in the Vegas area and service was outstanding. The Henderson location was ok, but this one really stood out for me. After running errands all day, I needed to get something to eat, but didn't want fast food. Luckily, when I walked in, I was seated right away. Our server, Ralph, introduced himself, named off the specials of the restaurant and had a warm smile throughout the whole time.   I went for their famous chicken and waffles with strawberry butter. My friend ordered the San Francisco Benedict. Ralph comes out from the kitchen and informs me of the hot and sweet dipping sauce for the chicken. He puts out the syrup, a bowl, pours out some syrup in the bowl, and puts in a couple of dashes of Louisiana Hot Sauce and lets me know I could add more hot sauce if I wanted more heat. Sensing my skepticism, he assured me it was great combination. The food came out shortly and I spooned some of the hot-sweet sauce over the chicken and the waffles. First off, the waffles were super fluffy. I am not a huge fan of waffles because sometimes it's too crunchy and cuts the roof of my mouth, but these were breakfast clouds. The whipped strawberry butter was excellent and gets extra points for 1) being whipped and not a hard block of butter 2) not super sweet. The chicken served is a half of a whole chicken, so portion is huge. It was super juicy and had a great crust. If you get the syrup soaking in the crust, it softens the crust a bit in a sweet and hot flavor blanket. A little heat and a little sweet is what I like! Outstanding plate! My friend said the eggs Benedict was delicious and the big slices of avocados was a big plus. They did not skimp on the goodies here!   When it was time for the check, I did not feel rushed at all. The male manger came out to see how our meal and service was too. Nice! It is so refreshing to get genuine service and great food at the same time without breaking the bank. I will definitely be going back to this location and kudos to Ralph and the gentleman manager for an excellent meal and service to match."}
{"text":"American diners- images of hot waffles, cups of coffee and hearty meals come to mind. Metro Diner certainly delivered to my expectations of diner comfort food. I have seen the location on Rainbow, but I am elated they opened another location in Henderson.   I went on a Sunday morning and it was packed, but was seated in about 2 minutes by a very friendly host. The server, Leah, was very sweet and knowledgeable. There was sincerity in the customer service I can appreciate. She went over the menu noting the items highlighted in green are items unique to their diner and/or has been featured in the Fiid Network's show-Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. They also feature flavored coffee and flavor iced teas that changes daily. Also, breakfast is served all day and evening. There is plenty of staff working the kitchen and the dining area, which was great to see because it was so busy, but no one looked frazzled and patrons were checked up on frequently.  I tried the Monte Cristo and John's Senior's sandwich. The Monte Cristo was huge! Definietly a shareable plate. It came with a side of I think blackberry jam which added a bright and fruity note to the very filling battered and fried sandwich. The turkey was very moist and the ham was not too salty. Did I mention the jam? Be sure to dip the sandwich in it! It went surprisingly well together.   The John's Senior sandwich was named after the owner's father because he came up with it and was one of his favorites. It had bacon, swiss cheese, 2 sunny side eggs (cooked medium) and a slather of good ol' mayo. Served between two sliced multigrain bread. The egg yolks oozed ever so slightly and the tang of the mayo went well with the smoky bacon. For something so simple, it was done well.  Server came by with the tablet to pay. You can pay with plastic or cash. I was a little thrown off if I needed to pay a little early since I was still working on my meal, but I didn't mind since I was able to finish my meal at the end without feeling rushed.  All in all, service and food met my expectations of comfort diner food. Genuinely friendly and efficient staff. Plenty of other diner items to try in the future. Will be back for sure. Welcome to the neighborhood Metro Diner!"}
{"text":"Get here early cause the wait can be long. Long waits mean good food most of the time and Metro Diner does not disappoint. Please try the chicken and waffles, it will change you life. LOL"}
{"text":"Metro Diner is a great spot when I want an easy, hearty meal or have a particular craving. The food is mostly good (at the very least, decent) with strong standouts, the portions are large, and the price is right.  After a few visits, my favorite dish is unarguably the Fried Chicken & Waffle ($15.99). The order comes with half a chicken, super crispy and very moist, and a fluffy Belgian-style waffle. Plus, their strawberry butter (it only comes with this dish, but can be purchased for 50¬¢) and tasty concoction of Louisiana hot sauce and maple syrup dubbed their \"signature sweet and spicy sauce.\" The whole dish is magic. Fantastic fried chicken, great waffle, and wonderful condiments. I have to actively stop myself from ordering it each time.  Charleston Shrimp & Grits ($17.49): Fried grit cakes with cheese, roasted red peppers, and Andouille sausage. Topped with shrimp, sausage, onion, and peppers, bacon, and scallion in a creamy shrimp sauce. WOW. The grit cakes are great and everything is so flavorful. It is a very heavy dish though, so I'd recommend sharing and ordering another lighter option.  The Holy Davoli Burger ($13.49) is another killer dish, but really, approach with caution. It's a burger with two loaded grilled cheese sandwiches in lieu of a bun. You already know it's insanely bad for you, but daaamn, it is so, so delicious. I took two bites and called it a day (it was Ruben's anyway, lol).  Pittsburgh Sandwich ($12.99): Smoked pastrami, provolone, fried egg, fries, cole slaw, and tomato. Their sandwiches and burgers are seriously crazy. CRAZY GOOD! Another Ruben selection and we both enjoyed it. The bread does give out pretty quickly from all the content's moisture, so I'm thinking maybe toasting?  Yo Hala on the Square ($12.99) is their stuffed French toast featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. It has a lot going on from banana, cream cheese, berry compote, and syrup, but it's scrumptious! It's not my type of dish as it is rather sweet, but I wouldn't mind a bite!  Biscuits & Sausage Gravy ($9.99): Their biscuits are fantastic (fluffy with a nice exterior crust) and the sausage gravy is the way I like it - the right consistency, great flavor, lots of sausage, and a touch of spice.  I just tried the Chicken Pot Pie (Jumbo; $11.49) and I wasn't a fan. It sounds pretty standard from the description, but it was very different from your classic pot pie. First, the chicken was seasoned, baked, and added on top rather than cooked with the dish. Second, the concoction of vegetables and cream, though good, did not have that beloved chicken pot pie taste and it was strangely thick. This part could've been a kitchen mishap, but it was not super creamy as if it was overwhelmed with roux or overcooked.  The Pittsburgh Steak Salad, Pot Roast, and Garden Salad were decent/just okay dishes. I wouldn't mind eating the Pittsburgh Steak Salad again, but I would order the fries on the side (since I like my fries crispy).  All of my experiences have been great, with my most recent visit being an exception. I've only ever visited during busy mornings, but this time I came in between lunch and dinner. There were only two other diners there that were wrapping up when we arrived. Our food took over 30 minutes. No one visited us during this very long wait to explain or apologize. It didn't even seem like our server knew it had taken that long. I asked for the check shortly after receiving our food and upon dropping it off, we were told to \"take our time.\" Yeah, I would have loved to take my time, but we didn't get our food until 45+ minutes after we got there. So, we only had 30 minutes to eat and it was an uncomfortably rushed meal."}
{"text":"This place is a must do.from the moment you walk in the place you feel right at home like your in your grandma kitchen..the service is outstanding the food is perfect..I had the chicken and waffles with the strawberry butter...all I can say is just tryn to why are you reading this review you should be THeir now"}
{"text":"Our first visit to this restaurant on its' second day of business.  It is obvious that management is bent on pleasing customers.  Servers are mentored by trainers from a home store in Florida.  The Chicken Salad salad and Spinach salads were excellent!  The food being delivered looked plentiful and very appetizing.  This place will gain popularity in no time!  And thanks Nick for your attentiveness and cheerful demeanor."}

CLEANLINESS: 4 stars - when I walked in the front door, I seen the garbage can right away.. :(  FOOD: 5 stars - best chicken and waffle, I've had.   SERVICE: I gave 5 stars for my server (Finn), she's the best! But, I noticed that they were short staff, some customers waited at least 10 minutes to get their orders; Overall customer service: 3 stars... Hope management can step up.  PRICE: 5 stars - Very reasonable price!  OVERALL: 4.3 stars"}
{"text":"I live in Pineville an we have needed a eatery like this :)  Easy to find same shopping center as Dollar Store an Baskin Robbins . Lots of parking, walked in very friendly hostess. We were seated right away an our waiter came over very knowledgable  about the menu. So many great sandwiches to choose from an if your a breakfast person for dinner they serve breakfast all day.  I noticed the Pittsburgh sandwich an the Big Ben i said is the owner from Pittsburgh lol im a NC southern girl but I love my Steelers I ordered the Pittsburgh sandwich oh my. So its a thick cut of bread with your choice of Pastrami or Roast beef I got roast beef. With Cole slaw, tomato,  cheese an fries  an drum roll Please a fried egg. It was huge an I have a big mouth lol It was so good  It comes with a side I ordered mac n cheese. Now the mac n cheese could use some work I prefer baked mac n . But all in all ill b back with my friends to try other dishes. If your in pineville you gotta stop an enjoy this place Yum o   Update second visit just as great as the first time took  my parents they loved it. I ordered the fish sandwich it was a white fish huge sandwich with tarter sauce an lettuce/tomato an onion rings.  The fish was lightly fried or you can get it grilled or blackened. The best fish  sandwich an my dad loved the meatloaf an he is a mestloaf snob huge plate of food.   Update I was all set to have get my favorite fish sandwich an was told its no longer on the menu :(. I settled with the fish an chips n got onion rings instead of cole slaw Im not a big fan of up charges it should be in the price of your food. Ill be back but not as  often."}
{"text":"Definitely left this place full and happy. I've always wanted to check this place out and I finally found someone to go with me - it was both of our first time here and we were very happy about visiting today.  Cute place, was very busy on a Tuesday which is a good sign. I got the avocado wrap with the homemade chips which were great because I like my chips thick, they were perfect. My friend got their famous burger which was very flavorful.  The server was attentive and very sweet, I'll be back to try the chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"Food was great service was not! I like the food so I'll be back to give this place one last try. Please train your servers."}
{"text":"Hot turkey plate was good. Large portion with good gravy and saut√©ed squash/zucchini. Mashed potatoes were awesome. The meatloaf was also good but the best thing I ate was their chili!  Not a bad cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Very friendly waiter,  Ian. Service was wonderful. We had the specials of Dijon glazed Salmon and Braised beef tips. Both dishes were very good, with more than enough of a serving. Will definatley return."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something different for Sunday breakfast, so i browsed reviews and found Metro Diner.   When we got in it was pretty busy and there was a short 5-10 minute wait for our table. There was coffee and water in the waiting area which was a nice surprise.   We were greeted promptly by our server who was super friendly and energetic.   I settled on a breakfast burrito. When it came out I was overwhelmed by the size of it. As I dug in I quickly realized it was a classic example of quantity over quality. The burrito was covered with salsa which made it soggy on the bottom. I found that the egg whites inside were a little bland and needed salt. The burrito was filled with egg whites, green peppers, and black olives.   Service fell off towards the end with our drinks running empty.   The food was just OK. Maybe it was just what I ordered?"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now. Once alone and once with my wife. Had chicken and waffles one time and eggs, bacon, toast etc. another.   Great breakfast/brunch spot. Service is great. Food is wonderful and atmosphere is relaxing. Wait staff was very nice on both ocassions.  They get really busy (because they are good) so expect to wait at peak times."}
{"text":"I just moved to Vegas, and I'm originally from Jacksonville, Florida which is where the original Metro Diner is from. I was so excited to hear that there are multiple Vegas locations. When we walked in we were met with a warm welcome and I found out the hostess was actually from Jacksonville! I had been hyping this place up to my friend for forever and we were not disappointed. I got one of the best avocado, egg, BLT, open faced sandwiches I'd ever had.   Cannot wait to go back again!   10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"So glad this place opened!!!  Great food and absolutely the best customer service!  Everyone is super friendly and the restaurant is very clean!  We are looking forward to coming back and trying lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Been here 2 times... both times were on the spot! Chicken and Waffles are amazing, spicy syrup is sooo simple yet sooo tasty and the staff is awesome! Ohhhh, cinnamon roll pancakes... OMG!   Can't wait to go back... tomorrow for dinner fosho!!"}
{"text":"Stellar dining experience last night with my wife at Metro Diner! We were greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant and promptly seated. The restaurant had a positive energy, relaxed feel, and cool retro diner vibe. All the staff, including the management, were very friendly throughout the meal. Kiki our waitress arrived at our table promptly and asked if it was our first time dining with them. We said it was, and she explained the menu to us. She gave us time to review the menu and recorded our order on a tablet computer, instead of the old-school paper and pen method. I was surprised and pleased with the large variety of menu items. The prices were good and the portions exceeded my expectations. Prior to our food arriving we noticed a piece of food on one of our forks that didn't come off in the dishwasher. We were not upset but made sure to inform our waitress, who immediately informed the manager. Not sure if he was the store owner or manager, but he promptly stopped by our table and apologized, giving us two $5 off coupons to the restaurant. The manager was very congenial and chatted with us about our families for about five minutes...very cool guy! Kiki did a great job attending to us during the meal. The food was excellent and arrived at an appropriate temperature. Payment for the meal was done via debit card on the tablet computer, allowing for TIP addition. As we left the restaurant we were thanked by at least three Metro Diner staff and one of them held the door open for us as we left. VERY impressed with this restaurant...will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have now dined at this diner 4 times and I have not been disappointed a single time! Their staff has always been friendly, the service is quick, and the food is absolutely delicious! The prices are very reasonable and the portion sizes are quite filling. I thoroughly enjoy their comfort food and will continue to visit."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice. Excellent food, excellent service and nice ambience. The only thing that that my wife and I thought a problem was too much food... Not a problem. Both times I had the biscuits & gravy with two eggs, hash Browns and coffee. My wife had the chicken & biscuits. Very reasonable prices. We will visit again. Huntersville needs this type of food and dining experience."}
{"text":"Heard some people talk a lot about this place. I didn't think it was all that good, it wouldn't be my first choice to go out somewhere. The service however, the best it has been compared to any other place. Our server was awesome as he helped us decide what we want because it was our first time. He knew the menu well and entertained us with his \"sauce skills\". The steak in the steak n eggs was dry. The waffle was a little bit hard, but the strawberries were good. The chicken salad sandwich could have tasted better."}
{"text":"This place was good when it first open now they change they prices up and lowered they standers on service"}
{"text":"Had a great experience coming here the other day for breakfast so we decided to come for dinner. Guys, dinner is even better! I got the spinach salad with grilled chicken, and folks, the portions. Easily could have fed two or three people with this salad. And it tasted awesome! So good, exactly what I was craving. Can't wait to take my family here. And they have gluten free options! Service was great and the food even better. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Metro Diner has such wonderful, home-cooked meals I almost don't get homesick anymore!!  The food is always outstanding.  I enjoy their chicken salad sandwiches and meatloaf platters.  Their service is top of the line as well.  I'm always greeted immediately with a big smile and service throughout the meal is very attentive.  John A. has waited on me and remembers me every time I'm in!!  This is my favorite place to get a meal in Henderson!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Try the chicken and waffles with the strawberry butter and see the server Patience. Awesome service awesome food-definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Food was plentiful, service was great, and the chocolate almond coffee was delicious. Need to come back."}
{"text":"Both the food and service gets A+ So hard these days to find great service..... Other gm's take note! This is how you do it! Thank you to kitchen and front of house staff! 5 stars!!!! Y'all rock!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast. I've eaten at many of the breakfast places around the city, and this is definitely in my top 3 favorite. The food is solid and the service is top notch. The location, in a strip mall on pineville-Matthews rd was a turn off to me at first, but I quickly got over myself on that, because it's just that good. Do yourself a favor and try it out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"I was visiting my family in Vegas and also having a little fun and stopped by this diner for some lunch. I had the club sandwich and I have to say it was the BEST club that I have had in a looooong time. The service is also not bad. I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"I was referred to Metro Diner by my cousin and diners, drive-ins, and dives. They seem to know what they're talking about. As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a smile and sat immediately at the counter. The counter seats look directly into the kitchen, and I really liked that I could watch the food being cooked and listen to the interactions between the servers and the kitchen staff. The kitchen staff even greeted me and interacted with me throughout my visit there, which I personally enjoy because it really makes me feel welcome. Service and comfort are the biggest things to me when it comes to rating and reviews, and this place nailed both categories.  The food was just as good! I had the challa french toast breakfast special, which came with eggs, bacon, has browns, french toast, and an English muffin. If I had eaten anything at all today, I would probably not have been able to finish it all. The French toast was delicious and the fruit on top of it added some good sweetness and tart to balance it out (bananas and strawberries). The bacon was perfect and the eggs were cooked just right. The hash browns were well done and a little too crispy for me, but this being my first time it was a learning experience. I'm sure if I ordered them differently they would have nailed it. Absolutely wonderful.  Overall, between the great service, friendly interactions, and delicious food, this place got an easy 5 star from me. I'll be back for sure and it will be an easy recommendation to make for friends/family looking for a good breakfast here in henderson."}
{"text":"Delicious food and fantastic service. One of my favorite diners! Will have to return to this location again."}
{"text":"Recently had my first visit. I enjoyed my meatloaf and my husband's sandwich looked great. We will be back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their strawberry cheesecake stuffed waffles...to die for!! Croissant French toast...definitely craveable! Our server Hannah, super awesome! Excellent service and food! Definitely will, and have frequented this establishment since my first visit. Love it!"}
{"text":"Food is great but unfortunately this is about second time with crappy service ...the food comes one plate at a time all within 5-10 minutes apart... my side salad came last without the dressing... our waitress made every excuse in the book about service... blamed the kitchen when food didn't come . Kept saying everything is fresh so it takes longer then when we would look over towards the kitchen I could see the food in he window while she's gabbing with her pals in the corner...."}
{"text":"Love love love. All I can say. Huge portions, low prices and everything we ate was delicious. Chicken and waffles as well as the chicken pot pie. Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"\"Fresh\" orange juice? yeah they squeezed that can very well! Really?! The waiter had the nerve to tell me \"is just a fancy name, no restaurant does that\" my reply \"yeah Rise and Shine!\" His answer \" only fancy places on the strip\" ? #waiteroftheyearaward wth really bad food"}
{"text":"Stopped by here with my gf because we have heard good things about these little diners.  Definitely not disappointed! Very good American food with an 50s vibe attached to it. Kind of resembles anI-Hop or a Denny's except it doesn't feel \"ghetto\".  Service was good and food was good too! If you are thinking of somewhere to take the family and have a nice but not crazy expensive sit down meal with a good amount of selections then this isn't place for you :)"}
{"text":"Amazing place , come here all the time very clean the bathrooms are well kept they stay busy which is a good hungry at times hahaha every when your in a rush they seem to assist you very fast which is good they have a full staff which is nice. Some places are very short staffed on the weekends which I hate lol, very spacious the ambiance is nice I appreciate it very much love the black am white checkered floor reminds me of s huge chess board I love chess lol or checkers whichever. The have an assortment of really good organic teas which my wife loves. Idk it might be one of the reasons we come  glad we do though  my favorite is the famous BOLD CIRY BURGER , I seem to get it all the time I have posted videos of it before from times I have came. Tonight I got it again , and my wife got the club sams which I swear it's enough for 2 I love it because she gives me some haha well if you here try it out it's great"}
{"text":"It was about 2:00 in the afternoon on a Sunday & I hadn't eaten yet, so I was in between wanting breakfast or lunch.  I was getting my nails done so I was helping a nearby place and found Metro Diner.   The chicken & waffles instantly caught my eye and I went straight there with the boyfriend.  He ended up getting the fried chicken plate.  Both of the dishes were delicious, my chicken was fried perfectly and the waffles paired well with the strawberry butter.  They come to the table and make the simple sweet & spicy sauce, which is Louisiana hot sauce with syrup.  Everyone was so nice!"}
{"text":"A solid diner choice. I have been here three times and appreciate the fresh food and good service. I love the honey chicken biscuit for a quick but filling bite. I'm hoping to try their french toast next time!"}
{"text":"Food had no flavor and the soup tasted like a can of condensed soup that was luke warm."}
{"text":"Got in and was greeted and seated very quickly. Very nice server. Best chicken and waffles ever. At first sight, I was over whelmed with how much chicken it came with. When I had took my first bite of my waffle it was so tasty and surprisingly very light. That explains why there's so much chicken!  And the sweet and spicy syrup went well with the strawberry butter. The chicken it self was so juicy. I couldn't put it down. Customer turn over was quick. I'm happily to say I'm coming back again."}
{"text":"I have went there 3 times, and the waiter and waitresses that helped were very nice. The first time I got biscuits and gravy, and it was pretty bland. I wish the chunks of meat were bigger In the gravy, but they were tiny. The second time I got the chicken and waffles, and it was very good. Kinda on the salty side, but that is ok because I like salt.  They third time I got chicken and waffles again because I liked it before, but this time it was bland. Different cooks don't put much seasoning?  I may give them another shot, but the food was only good 1 time out of 3 so I am not sure if I want to roll the dice again."}
{"text":"We went for dinner, very excited to t Check this new place out.... it was a disaster... the kitchen was behind on orders, a lot of customers were getting the wrong order plus some food will come out for your party and the rest will be out about 30 Mins later, and that was if they remembered.... the waitress was all over the place it took forever to get a refill on our drinks or just to even get extra napkins.... never returning here again."}
{"text":"Everyone is so happy here. Customer service A+++ AND the food very very good!! Presentation nice too. A truly pleasant surprise and experience. Highly recommend. PS Sausage gravy and biscuits can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Accessible parking. Nice vibe and design. Tried cheesey grits, mac and cheese, chicken tenders, and the American omelette. The food was stellar. Service was great. Having them bring an iPad to the table for you to pay with your card is a nice touch. I will definitely be returning to try more of their foodstuffs."}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch, got the chicken salad sandwich, fries and sweet tea. Everything was exactly how I like it and delicious! Ranch dressing is homemade and delicious. Wait staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Portions are huge. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong eating here. I've never had a bad meal and today was ahhhhmazing! We had the chicken and waffle and a side of home fry potatoes. The waitstaff can't get any better. Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to the chicken and waffles here, but the chicken was very so-so. Meat was a bit rubbery and skin was nothing special. The waffles were a saving grace - so soft and that strawberry butter, yum! Overall, one of the poorer chicken/waffles I've had. My wife had a breakfast sandwich that was simple - eggs, bacon, etc. but wow it was awesome! I'd give this place another chance, they've got a diverse menu, maybe I'll stick to the sandwiches. We went on a Sunday morning and it was packed, but they seat folks as best as they can. The hunt for great fried chicken in Vegas continues!"}
{"text":"The food was great! The staff were so pleasant and helpful. The chicken and waffles were my favorite. The croissant French toast was second. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"First time at this location, second time at a Metro Diner. Couldn't be more satisfied! Food was delicious and staff was so kind. Will most definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The service has always been consistent every time we've dined here. My favorites are the chicken and waffles , shrimp and grits and the biscuits and gravy!! We will keep coming back. You will not be disappointed in this choice!!"}
{"text":"We were greeted courteously by the staff.  However, our waitress wasn't friendly.  We felt rushed, perhaps the tone set by her as she scurried from table to table.  Not a comfortable ambiance.  My wife had the San Francisco Eggs Benedict and I the meat loaf.  Both meals were delicious.  As good as the meals were however, we'll likely consider another before returning."}
{"text":"Loved it!  First you walk in and they are holding the door open for you to come in.  You are then greeted and welcomed!  You are immediatly sat down and asked if you have been there before. Then you are asked what you would like to drink and referred to the back board of daily specials.   It was really tough what to chose here.  I wanted to try so many things.  I went with the chicken and waffles, especially because that strawberry butter looked so inviting!    The Chicken and Waffles was amazing! It is a large portion with enough to take some home.  The fried chicken was really, really good.  I suggest if you don't like the waffles combo just to order the fried chicken.    I would love to go back and have it again.   My friend ordered the patty melt and onion rings.  It was hard not to want to steal an onion ring from her, they looked so delicious.  She was highly satisfied with her meal as was I.   This is a good spot for locals who like good food and don't want to be on the strip."}
{"text":"Ricky was awesome!  The stuffing waffle and turkey was amazing!  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Food was good, services was really nice. Prices were ok. Large plates of food so come hungry."}
{"text":"Guy what are you thinking? How did this place get on Triple D? Did they pay you off? I mean really, less then 6 people in the whole restaurant and they can't get the order right? Oh that might be because the cook is leaning over chatting with the server and I assume the manager. When a customer sees that and then gets half of what they ordered !  And then when the other half finally arrives ( meanwhile you have just about finished the first half because it took so long ) so the 2nd half arrives and WHAMO it's wrong!!  Maybe the cook should spend more time cooking and less time chatting with the help! Maybe! I would give zero stars if possible. I will say I was here in the afternoon last week for the first time and it was good fast and everything came cooked at the same time so I thought I would give breakfast a shot BIG MISTAKE. How does a restaurant go down so fast? Anyway rant is over and with all the great places to eat in Las Vegas I would pass on Metro Diner and go to maybe Mr Mama's instead."}
{"text":"OMG....my finance has been wanting to try this place forever. We both work in Pineville and I never realized it was so close. Finally ate lunch today. He had the chicken pot pie and a cup of broccoli cheese soup. I tasted both and they were aahhmazzing. I got the meatloaf as I read so many great reviews. I'm very parsnickty about meatloaf. Let me tell you it DID NOT disappoint. Delish. We might be back for breakfast this weekend. Yum! Staff and Mgmt were awesome as well."}
{"text":"One of the really good breakfast places I have visited so far! I ordered the cheesy grits and bacon and egg croissant. I feel that I didn't order something extravagant enough to review, but I really want to come back and try something new. It was overall a really nice, clean place with great service. Our food also came out pretty quick. I tried grits for the first time and it's not for me. But, I can't wait to come back and delve into some other dishes. And the prices are also very fair and reasonable, nothing too crazy expensive."}
{"text":"Thank you Ashley for recommending the HOV.   The food and service here was fantastic. I can't wait to visit again.   My server Ida was great. Could be the best breakfast I have had."}
{"text":"Great food but the removing of the Monte Cristo from the menu hurts its rating. Bring it back and I will raise the rating."}
{"text":"I was very happy to see this location is nothing like the locations in Jacksonville. the food was great and the service was great. The staff was great."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast last Saturday with a party of 6 and it was great.  Good food, large portions, outstanding service and a military discount make this place a fantastic spot for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Watch out, it does get pretty crowded on Sat mornings."}
{"text":"This was an excellent diner for breakfast. I ordered the Bissell breakfast. Scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon, English muffin, pancakes, and grits (the deal breaker for me). All of it was perfectly cooked and so good! I had the hazelnut coffee, which was the coffee of the day. The coffee is good, not sweet so you will have to sweeten it. The waitress was amazing, as well as the other staff members who helped us. Truly enjoyed this diner and highly recommend it for a breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast options.  You can't go wrong.  I had the meat omelet and it was great.  Others had the cinnamon roll pancakes and the veggie omelet.  All were amazing.  I'll be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here! Love the diner vibe! Service was great and food was delicious! My husband got the Holy Davoli burger, which is a 1/2 pound burger in between two grilled cheese sandwiches as buns and I got the Fricken chicken tender sandwich! No complaints! Can't wait to come back and try the chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"I appreciate that owner Tony responded to my step-kids feedback.  We will definitely give this place a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"Not like my hometown diner but the food selection is great and the food was delicious. Wait staff was very friendly and service was quick"}
{"text":"FOOD:  Huge Portions....everything that passed by our table looked delicious.   I met my match with the pork tenderloin sandwich.   My friend got the pot roast....he said he felt like they played it safe....but it was still good.  My other friend got a basic breakfast.... he was OK with his too.  Cost:  Pricing was all over the board.   More expensive than typical diners....but the large portions justify it.....I guess.    Service:  Seems to always be on a wait...but I believe thats because its new.   Our server was full of personality, very efficient, and was just great  Atmosphere:   not a very warm feeling environment...kinda basic .... with an old skool throw back kinda feel.   Location: Easy to find, lots of parking, lots of places to wait.  Would I go there again?  Yes.   Is it the best in town...not quite yet...... but its not bad.  My only MAJOR SUGGESTION -   Later evening hours....till at least 10 or 11.   You are losing business by closing at 8.  There are very few places in Charlotte that are open to eat past 9 PM.  That is frustrating.   Later evening hours would be a HUGE plus!"}
{"text":"Alicia and I heard about this place and of course remember it's East Coast store being on Guy's DDD show. It's nestled in there off Serene, sort of in the Sam's Club / Walmart parking lot, sharing parking with Aaron's Furniture. It's inconspicuous and signage not totally obvious but a gem of a dining spot.   Service is excellent, genuine and always friendly (5 visits so far, first review). For dinner they feature chalkboard specials. Favorites include the chicken fried steak (gravy is out of this world) and the Peach Cobbler (crazy!!) Last night they featured different specials but I asked if they had the Chix Fried Steak and the wait staff checked, sure enough they did it for me anyway. Breakfast is great too and if you don't want to wait a small wait for a table, sit at the counter-it's great. Well, I'm dreaming about the Cobbler, but this....you have to take in moderation. We'll be back (soon enough :) hopefully their fan base keeps growing. I enjoy not waiting for a table but it needs to be full in order to remain here for hopefully years to come."}
{"text":"Our first time here and it was amazing!! Our server was Disney and she was on top of it and had excellent recommendations. Very amazed with how awesome our service was! Very good food as well.   We will be back as soon as we can I am sure."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a few times & this is the first time that I was dissatisfied with the service. Our bill was dropped on our table while we were still eating & that was it. (We had not requested the bill).  No offers of drink refills or dessert.   I have often raved about their great food & service. I hope the food doesn't go downhill like the service did.   From our first review:  Great food, great variety, great service. If they had a liquor license, they would be perfect!"}
{"text":"1st time there today and WOW!!  We were seated right away, and place was packed!!  Waitress was funny and ontop of drinks. Food was tasty, & no complaint from kiddos, thats a plus.. i ordered the Egg Benedicts and ask for my egg poached hard.. always! Other places i have to send my plate back cuz its not done, these guys did on FIRST TRY!! We will def b back... other places need to be on the look out, new kid on the block is GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Our family chose this place based on the previous reviews on Yelp and I'm glad we went. The chicken was well seasoned. It tasted like they marinated it overnight and then seasoned it some more. The croissant French toast was perfectly sweet and flaky.   We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door, there was a short wait and the food arrived quickly. If I ever visit Charlotte again, I'll be sure to come back."}
{"text":"Just tried this place the other day and it was delicious I would recommend the crab cake Benedict to anyone looking for breakfast."}
{"text":"Even though the diner was very busy, we received attentive and courteous service. The portion sizes were large. Food was fresh and delicious. A great diner experience."}
{"text":"I always get amazing service when I come to Metro! The staff is so friendly and the portions of food are HUGE. Definitely a great spot to get breakfast at any time of the day. Chicken and waffles are a must."}
{"text":"True southern style food! (Or, at least Florida style southern, lol) I am from Florida and was so excited to try this place and it not only met my expectations, it exceeded them.   The biscuits and gravy were the best I've ever had.  I order biscuits and gravy almost every time I eat breakfast, so I have had a lot. These biscuits were soft and buttery and very flavorful, not bland at all. The gravy was next-level delicious as well.   The homefries were HUGE!! And very very good!  Grits were hard...my only complaint. Even so, The 30 min drive was well worth it and I cannot bring myself to visit any other bfast joint in town after Metro.    Hannah...or was it Shannon? Either way, super friendly server who explained the menu and specials and was overall very friendly.   They have packets of jam, preserves, and marmalade at the table, as well as standard ketchup, salt, peppa, and Louisiana hot sauce.  Portions are huge, could easily share between two people.  Can't wait to go back and try their lunch or dinner items.  Oh yea, all their menu items are available all day!  What my stars mean:   5 is outstanding, a must-experience, someplace I would bring/recommend to a tourist  4 is great, someplace I would love to go back to again and again. Backup options to bring/recommend to a tourist   3 is good. Someplace I would return to if in the area. I probably wouldn't recommend to a tourist, but possibly to a local.   2 is ok but only because it is either cheap or convenient.  1 means I would not return"}
{"text":"I have been to the other 2 locations in town, and I always get the biscuits and gravy with homefries because its the best I ever had. It wasn't the same at this location though...the biscuits were fine but the gravy lacked flavor and homefries were burnt.  I'll give this location another try in hopes that maybe I just caught a cook on a bad day, but I won't be getting the biscuits and gravy again, Ill stick to the other locations for my fave dish."}
{"text":"Great home cooking comfort food. BEST biscuits and gravy I've ever had (sorry mom!). Hubby loved his grilled ham & cheese. Service was amazing and prices are great."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast and the pot pies. Staff is always friendly We go at least once a month never had anything bad their service is always great and always good"}
{"text":"I will be missing this place as we move to another state, this place is a Diamond in a rough. Awesome food and they'll accommodate Vegan/Vegetarian eaters. Love the awesome service and their hot chocolate is better than any diners I've tried (not hot water and chocolate powder).  It's worth trying this place."}
{"text":"Short review: Food quality/quantity:  5 Service:  5 Prices:  3.5 (they're a bit high IMHO for diner food) Music loudness:  2 (way too loud for what this place is.  It's not a bar or club). WiFi:  5   So overall a good place for traditional American food."}
{"text":"We have been to the Stephanie location several times now. Our first experience was amazing. Unfortunately each time we've been back our experience has declined. Today I had the soup and sandwich combo. The soup was a Manhattan style chowder, the sandwich ,the chicken salad. If you want a lighter meal this would be perfect. The portion was not overwhelming. Just right , however the chowder was very bland and the clams extremely tough. The sandwich was very bland and dry. Would not order this again  we will wait a bit before returning. Hopefully they can work the bugs out."}
{"text":"Our first experience was out standing both food and service. Had the Huevos Rancheros !!! Omg the best ever!! Second experience service very good and friendly. Huevos did not disappoint. The Monte Crisco was very disappointing. The oil was old making the sandwich very heavy in oil. the same oil had been used to fry fish. The sandwich was bitter , heavy and fishy. This location is still baby new and going through the growing stages. We will be back"}
{"text":"Wow--what happened to the service here???  Decided to take my father, who was visiting from out of town, out to lunch here on a Sunday. We were seated right away, but everything else went downhill from there. We ordered a club sandwich and the fish and chips, a seemingly straightforward order. After waiting for our food and not having seen our waiter for about 25-30 minutes, my father finally was able to flag our waiter down and asked him when our food would be ready. The waiter seemed confused and said he did not see that our orders had been entered and asked us what we wanted again. After he was gone for a few minutes, he came back and informed us that the kitchen had told him our food would be out right away. We saw several tables who were seated after us receive their food. Probably after waiting another 5-10 minutes we decided it was time to go. We were getting up from the table when the waiter hurriedly delivered the club sandwich and said the fish would be out soon. We told him we would take our food to go. No way were we going to sit there for much longer. Someone, who was not our waiter, came and brought the boxed sandwich to our table and said, \"Sorry about the wait.\" Then finally, about 40-50 minutes after we placed our order (the first time?), the boxed fish and chips came out. The waiter apologized and said that the kitchen had \"burned the fish\" and that was the cause for the delay. He told us there would be no charge for our lunch.  I was so embarrassed to have brought my father to this place and I would certainly feel embarrassed and angry to return to eat here. The food tasted pretty good, but the terrible service is what stood out. I'm not sure if our order was lost, never entered, or the kitchen \"burned the fish\" that was the cause of a 40-50 minute wait time on a club sandwich and fish and chips. Ordinarily I'm pretty forgiving of sluggish service if the place is very crowded. While the diner was busy (but no wait time at the front), this long of a wait for a club sandwich and fish and chips seems kind of excessive (especially after seeing tables seated after us being served their food and finishing their meals all in this time span). Although I appreciate our waiter saying there would be no charge, it is kind of disappointing that unhappy customers were never apologized to by a manager. Funnily enough our waiter said he hoped we would come back another time at the end of all this! Sadly, I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"Super friendly people, great food, super southern portions (haha) and great environment. Love the drink bar and love the service by the waitresses. Always have a great experience here and have food to take home. Love this place! Thanks for a great breakfast/ brunch experience every time!!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place as a breakfast place.  Will have to check it out for dinner as well!  1. The service is OUTstanding. 2. They can set up tables of varying length and size. 3.  The food is all homestyle and GREAT.  I love excellent service along with great home style food.  For breakfast, our group had everything from the burger, to pancakes, omelettes, protein plates and etc.  Lots of good food and reasonably priced.  I would put this on par with any other breakfast place in town. You cannot beat the location, price and service.  GK says, go for it."}
{"text":"Metro Diner is a delight, I'm satisfied every time I come in. It is a typical diner style restaurant but the food is amazing. The staff is very kind, helpful, and very pleasant. Ask for Dana, she is a very sweet, helpful and attentive waitress.  Each time I've tried something different but have never been disappointed. I've had the chicken and waffles with strawberry butter,talk about lick the plate chicken and waffles especially with the strawberry butter that goes with it. The special hot syrup is different and delicious twist to the normal chicken and waffles. I also have had the croissant French toast which is perfectly flaky and flavorful. My all time favorite there if you come during lunch is the bold city burger. The burger has cheese, bacon, sausage, and fried jalape√±os. Did I say FRIED JALAPE√ëOS!! So good.   I would definitely recommend this place it's open all day until 9 for breakfast and they have specials written on the board as well as the staff mentioning it upon being seated."}
{"text":"Dario and the team did an exceptional job! Very impressed with the service. Wait was not long and food was great!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Metro Diner. I wanted something for brunch time that was close to the Galleria mall (my next destination). It was Saturday around 11am. There was ample parking in front and in the back of the building. There was a 20-25 min wait, but it ended up being less than that. There were many people on staff and everyone who helped us from taking our order to clearing plates was friendly and timely. The menu had a lot of options and I already have some ideas for when I come back! The food was delicious! We got the fruity waffle and breakfast burger for 10 and 14 dollars. And I will say, the food wasn't just good, it was a step up from your typical breakfast place. It was very good. Although I could have stood some more bacon on the burger. I also saw a lot of salad options going by and they all looked incredible. Overall very satisfied with the experience.   Part 2: I came back the following weekend because my first experience was so good. I was expecting it to be another great experience, but this time it was out of this world! I'm blown away. We ordered chicken and waffles and the bold city burger. Let me tell you, best burger, ever (added avocado). Greatest chicken and waffles ever (tied with Hash House for best dish) except Metro Diner has STRAWBERRY BUTTER! The waffles at Metro are the lightest most amazing waffles ever and I found a piece of real strawberry in my strawberry butter! I can't even express how delicious this meal was (we half/half both dishes via plate swapping) Even the very last bite of the burger had ALL THE TOPPINGS on it. That never happens. John, our server was hilarious and attentive. Never missed a beat. And have I mentioned the music? Everything about this place is superb. Go there. Now!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I am never disappointed.  Shout out to my waitress Nichole for making our lunch fun and fabulous!!  Nichole,  you're the best!!! Go Sox (cough cough)."}
{"text":"Today was our first time at metro diner but won't be our last the food was great the service was incredible we had Shawn he was on it even gave us coffee to go A+ all around will be my favorite breakfast place I'm wanting to try dinner there now"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service, ample portions.  Had the chicken and waffles.  Was the best that I have ever had.  Chicken was tender, juicy and full of flavor.  Paired with strawberry butter and a sweet and spicy sauce (maple syrup and Louisiana hot sauce).  Family had a Monte Cristo Sandwich and Philly Steak.  Everyone let fat, dumb and happy!"}
{"text":"Review #2300!!  I was staying nearby and wanted a fairly simple dinner where it wouldn't be weird to eat alone. Metro Diner did me right.   I had no idea that is a chain but for all that, it was pretty good. The inside is modern and welcoming and there's seating outside too. I opted for a turkey dinner ($11) because who doesn't like a little Thanksgiving in April? It arrived quickly and was pretty huge in size.   The turkey was really good - not the gross \"loaf\" stuff and accompanied by real creamy mashed potatoes. I had a small sad because the turkey itself tasted great but was barely warm.   Service was great - nice all the way around and even hooked me up with a to-go iced tea. Would return."}
{"text":"Metro Diner is a nice place to take the family or for take out. The food is good and the environment is friendly and has a good neighborhood vibe. Portions are good size as well. I'd recommend this location for someone looking for a variety of good food."}
{"text":"Enjoyed their breakfast chicken and waffles  the staff was helpful and know their menu well, I would definitely recommend this place and they serve breakfast all day..."}
{"text":"This food here is delicious,staff is friendly and the diner is cute! I will definitely be returning ! My coworkers who I was with also loved it! Get pretty busy. Arrive early morning! Busy is a good sign!"}
{"text":"Cool menu. Love the new dining option. Their specials are quite unique and tasty. Expect a wait on weekend mornings but there are benches outdoors."}
{"text":"Eating at Metro right now, for the first time! This place is fantastic! Food, service, and cleanliness top notch! If you come here ask for Patience she is the best!!!! We had a cup of tomato bisque, chicken and waffles, All American burger and onion rings. Everything was so tasty!  We were treated amazing. All that for less than $40."}
{"text":"The food was amazingly good! I called to place an order over the phone. I was put on hold for almost 5 mins. So I called back telling them how long they had me on hold, so the guy took my order. When I went to pick it up I paid with a card and didn't think I should have tipped the guy for being the food in a bag for me. So I signed the credit card slip and give it back to the young man. It seems like he was pissed I didn't tip him. Really? You had me on hold for almost 5 mins and I needed to call back. That's why for the 4 star reviews."}
{"text":"My first visit to Metro Diner was a good news/bad news situation.  I'll give the bad news first.  I ordered the corned beef hash and poached eggs. It was not a good choice. The hash was mostly potatoes, and it tasted terrible. The eggs were thrown into a dish, and the toast that came with it had no butter on it, with no butter on the table. The entire meal was basically inedible. Even the eggs were unappealing. Also, I'm not sure why the menu states that the hash comes with poached eggs rather than eggs any style. I would imagine that they are available however the customer wants them.   I also found it off- putting that the server entered my order into a mobile ordering system. I guess this is something that places are doing now, but it threw me off. It felt like it does when someone is texting into their phone. It was like he was just taking my order, not trying to relate to me as a customer. I do not blame him for this- he was just doing what he needed to do to get the order in. I just don't care for the system.  I also didn't care for the fact that I kept being asked to vote them as the best restaurant in Lake Norman. On my first visit, at least give me a chance to have one meal first.   Now that I've gotten the bad news out of the way, here is the good news:  When I sent back my order, the staff was very understanding and helpful about it. There were at least two people who came around. When I ordered the turkey lunch instead, it came out quickly and it tasted pretty good.   Everything that I saw coming out of the kitchen- with the exception of what I first ordered- looked very good. So I think that I either ordered the 'wrong' item, or that it was prepared by someone new.   The restaurant is very clean, and there is a nice variety of items to choose from on the menu, including daily specials.  I would be willing to come back and try something different next time- perhaps the fried chicken."}
{"text":"What happen to your location in Spring Valley on Tropicana, please? It was the best near my home at Rhodes Ranch Country Club. We were disappointed to see that it's totally gone!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in on Friday, July 21st for brunch.  We live in Rhodes Ranch and was actually trying to go to the newest location on Rainbow, but were at the Lowe's on Trop and got directed to this one...didn't even know there were two locations.  I'm super big on customer service, especially where I'm spending my valuable time and money.  In this town, it really counts because there is so much competition.    We were greeted quite warmly and the friendliness just escalated....from the hostess to the waitress.  The manager made a point to come over to ask us how was everything, but he engaged us in a friendly sincere conversation. They all made us feel very very welcome.  The food is AMAZING!!!! My husband had the best Chicken and Waffles outside of Los Angeles' Roscoe's where they originated.  They give you real pieces of half a chicken and not just breast or tenders like most here.  His waffles came with strawberry butter that had small bits of strawberries.....YUM YUM.  I had the Charleston Shrimp and Grits....OMG!!!! It was absolutely delicious.  Unfortunately, we just went to the Rainbow location which has only been open about a week.  We had an absolutely great hostess and Richard the waiter.  However, the manager talked to everyone around us, looked my husband in his face and never ever engaged with us while we were there.  So, needless to say, I will NOT be going back to the Rainbow location although it's a straight shot from where we live.  Oh forgot to mention the delicious cobblers.  The first time we had the apple and last night we brought a strawberry one home.  If you have not tried them you have not enjoyed the entire Metro Diner experience.  I do understand that they are about to open near our old home in Green Valley Ranch very soon!!! CHEERS!!!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 6 there at 11am on a Saturday. Hostess told us 50 min wait but that things were moving quickly so probably wouldn't take that long. We were seated in about 20 minutes and were lucky enough to score a nice big booth.  Decor was uninspiring. Just an open room with a bunch of tables. I think it would be fun to sit at the counter where you can watch the kitchen. Server was very nice.  Food was meh. I had the croissant french toast and nothing at all to say about it. I would have been thrilled if, even though bland, it was served hot.  No reason to return."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast, lunch and dinner diner. Food is great and the service has been amazing every time if been here. Would recommend it to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"I have been twice and I am not impressed.  Horrible grits, not real rye, over mad eggs were less than over easy.   Burnt toast each time.  I dont get it."}
{"text":"When we first started going to this location a year ago, I couldn't have imagined I would be writing THIS review, but here goes... It used to be the lines were out the door, at least a 20-30 minute wait.  Once inside and seated, the kitchen was bustling, service staff was all over, customers were all taking and the place was ELECTRIC! Now, none of the above applies. Kitchen, quiet, and the food is sub par; a FAR cry from what it was, and that's amazing considering there isn't much of a wait anymore and the kitchen cooked a lot better when it was busy!  Today, my \"special\" country fried steak breakfast was flat out BURNT and they tried to conceal that by putting the worst side down and hiding the rest of it under gravy. Problem is, burnt is burnt and you discover that when you first cut into the damn thing! It was SO bad, my server saw it and without even saying a word( she was totally embarrassed, so it's not like she was trying to be rude) she took it away to show management and the kitchen.  Problem is NO ONE from management came over to the table, NO ONE!!!! If they had, they'd have also discovered the hash browns were equally as offensive; SCORCHED!! Every since this \"Lynn\" became a manager at this location the place seems to have fallen apart, from the hostess station and hostesses and the kitchen.  We love the server crew, ALL of them are wonderful (shout out to Ida, Kyle and April, all of whom are top notch and apologies to the others we haven't had the pleasure of meeting) and you can see they bust their butts to make up for things. But folks, the experience starts at the hostess station and ends with the kitchen, and when 2 of the 3 fundamentals of making and keeping a great restaurant are as jacked up as this one is, it's over!  The writing is on the wall in this place, and it's fixable. Question is, will they?!  I was HIGHLY put off that this manager was talking to the next table about the fish and chips when I ate NOTHING and not so much as an apology or \"is there something else we can get you instead\"!  You may very well have lost my families business and we have been coming here at LEAST once a week for over a year and are HEAVY tippers!  There have been several other incidents in the past  I haven't mentioned, but like a bad marriage, you can love it, but there comes a time when you gotta leave it and move on."}
{"text":"Went based on the great reviews.  Did not disappoint.  Service and food was on point!  Every person I interacted with was customer focused and super friendly.  Had outside and inside seating.  The food, wow, monte Christo was delicious and flavorful.  Huge portions and so delicious!  Our server was attentive and awesome.  Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Having frequented the other metro I came in with high expectations.  Perhaps too high.  The food took forever to be brought to the table.  I watched our meals sit at the window for almost 10 minutes.  We were brought three of the four plates, at different times.  The person sorting and distributing seemed overwhelmed.  We had to ask for the fourth plate as I watched it sit at the window while other meals went out around it.  As a result the food was just meh.  My yohala was super soggy, the grits were over cooked and the pot pie was dry.   I'm not sure if sitting at the window contributed or not.   Hoping this is just opening pains as this location is much closer than the pineville one.  Will update the review the next time I frequent this location."}
{"text":"9/16/17 Update: Went for the 2nd time with family from the East Coast. They had breakfast and I tried the Metro Burger OMG Delish! It was so yummy and flavorable!  First review: Went here for breakfast for the first time with my Hubby. Had been hearing about it and the choice was Metro Diner today!  It was great to just being able to walk in and be seated, we appreciated that.  Everyone was friendly and smiling. We were excited to try. I ordered the Challah French Toast, it came with sausage,eggs, biscuits and cheese grits. I was confused why I got two starches, French Toast and a biscuit.   Waitress forgot the syrup, and was MIA for a while so I ate it without. Was bummed on the Challah, tasted like regular French toast.  Everything else was ok. Maybe I was believing the hype, I will try them again with dinner and see how that goes!"}
{"text":"I had the waffles stuffed with a strawberry cheesecake compote and it was DELICIOUS! The meatloaf that my mom ate was also top notch. A four person dinner was so cheap and the quality of food was outstanding! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast during prime time on Saturday morning. We were told it would be a 30 minute wait, but it was less than that. We were seated in a huge booth in the back which was nice considering it was just two of us. The coffee was delicious, but it took a while to get a refill. The food also took some time to arrive, but the waitress apologized for the delay and said they usually aspire for an 8 minute turnaround. My Greek omelet was tasty thanks to the olives, otherwise it would have been bland. The potatoes were a tad bland, but they were nicely cut. The pancake was thick and satisfying. My husband didn't care for his huevos rancheros because he felt there was too much going on. He would have preferred a simpler take on the dish. Overall, we had a good experience and will return.  My husband ordered a pumpkin cheesecake to go which looked really good."}
{"text":"Had brunch with the fam last Sunday and had a thoroughly marvelous time. From their breakfast special to crab cakes eggs Benedict and the SF eggs Benedict to their chicken and waffles, food was delish. Portions were large and value was awesome. Service was quick, place was cute and clean and parking was ample."}

Service was quick, place was cute and clean and parking was ample. Although we ate at Metro diner, it wasn't this location but the new one off Serene and Eastern that we did..."}
{"text":"As a Jacksonville native, home to the original Metro Diner having one near our home here in Vegas is a dream come true! Walking into the restaurant automatically feels like we're back home! Everything on the menu is perfect! My personal and cheap fave is the chicken biscuit! Thick cut chicken, battered and fried perfectly on an a crusty biscuit that melts in your mouth! Their comfort food is perfect on those days when you just need a pick me up! Definitely try the pot roast and the chicken and waffles! Yum!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place.  When we went the service, prices, and atmosphere were all good.  Some of the food was quite good too such as the broccoli cheese soup and chicken veggie wraps.  However, some other food we ordered was way too salty such as the chili and the pot roast.  So if you go, you may want to tell them to go lightly on the salt unless you really, really like salty food."}
{"text":"My family and I are big fans of Metro diner. It is a chain, so don't go in thinking it's a local thing - the d√©cor is made to be retro, which we really like, but the positives to a chain restaurant are very much in play here... (I recognize there can be negatives to chains, but Metro hasn't showed those to negatives to us yet)! They're based out of Jacksonville FL and we've been to a number of their restaurants (including Vegas) and we can always rely on the staple items we enjoy for breakfast. My \"mini\" almost always gets the special pancake offering (cinnamon roll pancakes - O-M-G)! Hubs changes it up and rarely gets something that disappoints and I stick with the tried & true avocado toast with a side of egg-whites. I know, it sounds uber healthy and not filling enough, but trust me, the avocado toast is hardly wimpy and the bread is hearty! The Louisiana hot sauce is a great addition to any egg dish but it's spicier than Texas Pete or Tobasco, so be ready for some heat if you use it.... Overall, we're regulars and hope this place opens another location in Charlotte soon."}
{"text":"Best southern dining experience I've ever had. All the dishes that we tried was great but my favorite is the shrimp and grits. Must try!!!"}
{"text":"We have had a couple of meals here, one takeout meal here, and have been here when its busy and when its quieter. My first experience was the takeout. Very nicely packaged, a little smaller portions than eating in, but overall good food. My second experience I had was not so great  with a waitress who had her hands on her nose and mouth , trying to stop a Nasal drip or something. She didn't wash them before she took the menus from another table, and handed kids some drink cups......that was a turn off for me. I said something and it was rectified with a new waitress. But the gross one did tell all of the other ladies, so they were all gawking my way. Why not gawk at her for being gross in front of others. Heck, everything she touched they probably touched after.....Gross! After that issue, on my third visit I was given a free meal (didnt happen on the day of our issue) this time our server was amazing. She did tell us though that she had been told who i was.....i didn't do anything wrong.....yet i was still being pointed out.  4th visit was today. My husband had never been, so it was a treat day. They were super busy. People everywhere. Our wait time was longer. Not horrible but a little wait. I noticed a similar theme though, and its sad, because it was already brought up, and although we love the food and have mostly been treated well, there is a hygiene issue here. Today, a waitress with braids had her hands all over her mouth and rubbing her nose. An older brunettee with a short bob was messing with her face too. They were in front of my table, near the pick up station, grabbing their customers food. Several times, back and forth, and same issue. Miss tall blonde braids, there is a very nice bathroom there, and you can use a tissue and then wash your hands. But no, you stood behind becky and rubbed your face several times while waiting for plates of food  for your customers. Face wipe, grab plates of food, serve it and all over again. I was front and center for the show Between you and the brunette. Touching others plates after touching your faces???? What the hell? And the older blonde who was seating people, she was doing it too. So the waitresses and seating staff at metro, listen up..... If you would be horrified to watch me wipe SNOT off my face, then grab a plate of food for you and give it to you with my unwashed snot hands, i would tell you that's what its like, and then we pay you for it! KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF YOUR FACES LADIES. Period. You have a bathroom, with soap and water. Use it. Go in the bathroom and be discreet. People are watching you touch their plates, and menus and payment kindles.  And if any manager is reading this, check for yourself, those ladies i described were working today. I think they need a hygeine class before someone doesn't write you a note, they just call the health department. HANDS OFF YOUR FACES!!!  That's a pretty basic request, right?"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken plate. Very good meal and excellent service by waitress named Patience. A little bit on the pricey side but will return."}
{"text":"Great service and really good food. Best waiter we have ever had is Phillip!  He made you feel loved and cared for without being creepy! The food is really good. Everything we tried the blackened shrimp the breakfast pie chicken pot pie are all excellent.  Sure wish they had these in California. Thanks Phillip for making the experience so great!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing food. Will defiantly be back! That strawberry butter whip on the waffles is soooo good!"}
{"text":"Our visit here started off not so great. We sat down and within minutes had our drinks served, however we then waited 20 minutes to have our order taken. And the only reason it was taken was because a server, Rachel, mistakenly came by to ask if we had the to-go dessert. When we told her how long we had been waiting, she immediately apologized and put our order in. While waiting for our food, the manager, Tony, came by to apologize and comped our meals for the trouble. We only had to wait about 10 minutes, if that, for our food to come out and let me tell you, it was worth the wait. My husband got the key lime pie stuffed waffles and chicken biscuit sandwich, which were both absolutely delicious (I totally stole some of it). I had the country fried NY strip meal, the steak itself was alright but the potatoes and eggs were really good. Rachel and Tony both stopped by multiple times during our meal to make sure everything was good and we noticed Tony stopping at every other table as well, which is fantastic! My husband and I will definitely be back to try some more delicious food, thank you Tony and Rachel for saving us from walking out with your outstanding service!"}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit to this location. It was EXCELLENT!  I've previously had The Bissell Breakfast, but today I had the New Meatlovers Omelette with ham, bacon, sausage and cheese.  I had onions added. I also opted for grits and toast. The meal was AWESOME.  When the meal is so good that you get the head sweats you know it's good. They actually saut√©ed the onions in the omelette, WOW. I always try to sit at the counter overlooking the kitchen to watch the action, and these are the best seats in the house. Great meal! #headsweats, #sittingonswole."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. My main complaint is the price. For a retro style restaurant that calls itself a Diner, I wasn't expecting to spend $50 for two people. If I knew I was gonna spend that much on dinner, we would have gone somewhere nicer. This is a chain. There are local diners with food just as good for half the price. Like I said, the food is pretty good, but, it isn't worth what they charge."}
{"text":"Super fast service and food. Restaurant was packed, but we had our food in probably less than 10 mins from ordering, simple, home cooked inspired meals. My husband got the meatloaf and I got the shrimp and grits. He raved and cleaned his plate. I liked my dish ok, but it wasn't what I was expecting, I like traditional New Orleans style, but this was Charleston, smothered, basically drowning in a bland, white gravy almost soup. I fished out the shrimp which were cooked just right, and left the rest. It was so disappointing especially since my husband loved his meal so much and I could see all the other dishes coming out the kitchen looking amazing, next time I'm getting the fried chicken, but save yourself from heartache and pass on the shrimp and grits"}
{"text":"I have been searching for the best chicken and waffles in the United States for many years. While visiting friends in Huntsville we went to the Metro Diner. Unbelievable chicken, unbelievable waffles. Do not miss this place, no matter what, even if you're not hungry!!! Amazing"}
{"text":"Tried this place last night. All I can say is WOW!!! Super friendly staff and great food. Our server was John. He was super personable and full of knowledge. We will definitely be back to try more.  The food was served in huge portions and full of flavor.  They definitely take pride in everything they do."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles w strawberry butter is probably one of the best things I ever ate!"}
{"text":"I am so very excited to have Metro Diner nearby now. They are phenomenal! The service is amazing and the food...oh the food. We actually went one evening and then the next morning. YES! It is that good. I had the chicken and waffles with their sweet and spicy syrup (syrup mixed with their hotsauce) and it was great! The Fried Chicken is better than Southern Baptist Church Fried Chicken, and for those who understand that reference, you get it. For those that do not understand the reference, that means it is amazing. The waffles have a strawberry butter, yes you read that right, STRAWBERRY BUTTER, on them. The portion is pretty large and you could probably have enough for two decent meals with just one. My wife had just the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese. She is a macaroni and cheese critic and travels the country looking for the best (well not really, but sounds fun though), point is she loves mac and cheese and she said this was some of the best she ever had. The kids had waffles and enjoyed them as well. The next morning I had a chicken biscuit, it was fantastic as well. Overall, this is a great place to eat and the service was over the top good. I highly recommend and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yay!!!! REDEMPTION , We came back to Metro Diner in hopes our experience would be like the first and it definitely was great.   The young lady at the hostess stand with glasses had a smile and greeted us right away , our service was attentive and courteous.   The food was delicious , we received all the correct orders and the portions here are equal to the money you will pay .   My veggie omelette had asparagus, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes , and peppers . The Udi's gluten free toast was a perfect choice ."}
{"text":"Chicken & waffles....so BOMB! Hubby ordered the Pittsburgh and for those from Steeler Nation, this was as close as you can get to Primanti Bros- give it a try!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place after reading the menu and reviews. I was not disappointed! I tried their Chicken and Waffles. One word  Yummmy! My husband just wanted a dinner salad. It looked very fres and cold. Lots of veg's and he added some breaded chicken. It was cooked very nice. I cannot wait to come back and try their Meatloaf. I saw another customer order it and it looked deliscious."}
{"text":"First time Metro Diners.  We arrived at about 11AM, on a Saturday, & it was  buzzing with people (good sign). We were seated shortly after we arrived, not a long wait at all. Our server, Kyle B., made our dining experience even better. He explained the menu & gave his suggestions. I ordered the chicken&waffles (which he suggested) & my wife ordered a cheeseburger & fries. The food came out looking delicious & tasted even better than it looked. Kyle checked on us numerous times.  Needless to say, we will definitely be back for more delicious food & we hope to have Kyle as a server again."}
{"text":"I'm not to sure what all the hype is about. The waffles was good but the chicken wasn't very tasty. Service was fast and waiter was nice"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place for comfort food. Friendly and prompt service. Our group ordered the fried chicken, meatloaf, fish and chips, and that night's fish special. The fried chicken was the best dish by far. Will define go back to try some of the all day breakfast items."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and it was very busy.  Warm welcome and immediately sat us at a center table with the menu.  We waited. We waited. And we waited .  No one came to ask if we wanted water.  Actually no one came to our table at all.  Then another couple was seated right next to us and the server was immediately at their table asking what they wanted.  My husband and I ( the invisible people) got up and left.  Update:  7/24 we received a very nice apology from management.  I realize mistakes can happen and I won't judge on one misstep.  The other 2 times we went the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Top notch restaurant!  Perfectly prepared DELICIOUS food - excellent value!  Staff is friendly and VERY attentive!  Atmosphere is comfortable. A must while visiting Charlotte, NC!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with 2 other people, and I ordered the PITTSBURGH SANDWICH (Thick Chicago bread with your choice of our own smoked pastrami or roast beef. Topped with melted provolone cheese, a fried egg, french fries, cole slaw, and tomato. Served with your favorite side.)  It was interesting to say the least.  The sandwich was very dry, and although it wasn't a bad sandwich by any means, it was just ok.  The bread was WAY to thick, and flavors didn't really go together very well either. Their menu prices are more of a dinner price. For breakfast and lunch, they are VERY expensive.  All in all, we weren't impressed and the hype will wear off and I'd be pleasantly surprised to see this place still busy in a few months."}
{"text":"My new best friend, Tony from Metro Diner...bff because he fed me the BEST diner food I've ever eaten....and I love diners.   It's really special. It's scratch-made, so delicious, and even a superstar, like me. LOL. The stuffed French toast was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on Food Network.  The chicken and waffles are off the chain. The Mahi spinach salad is seriously the best spinach salad I've ever had. It is the perfect balance of savory and sweet and satisfying. The turkey and mash potatoes with vegetables or something that my kids will love, and I won't feel guilty in the slightest for feeding them there.   You gotta check it out!  The only location right now is on West Tropicana and Fort Apache. But have no fear, they'll be four locations here in Las Vegas by the end of the year including one in Henderson on Stephanie. And by next year there should be 8. So metro diner is investing in Las Vegas and they're here to stay."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre to good, depending on when you go...but wtf is up with the wait staff??? Went here with my Mr. About 4 times: the first time was their first Saturday open and it was awesome! Super friendly wait staff, Manager was super-schmoozy but over all nice and the food was on point! Second time with my 10 yr old, food was good but prices seemed like they almost doubled from our last visit...(shrugs)...fried chicken is the truth so we sucked it up... But the last two visits: I swear reality set in hard! Third visit for breakfast on an average Sat. Morning: 1 hr. wait...ok, but then another 20 min to have our order taken  and ANOTHER 40+ to get our food! Really?!?  People that came in after us got seated and we're eating before our food came. Our waiter was a space cadet!! He looked like he had a longgggggg night!  He was wandering around, kept staring at us and taking food all over the restaurant except to our table. Manager came over to apologize and gave free meal coupons because he was embarrassed. We swore we'd never come back.   And then tonight we went back! Space cadet was in rare form, but our waitress was unnecessarily rude! I ordered a plate that had 1/2 fried chicken which was too much so my Mr. Decided he would take the dark meat and order pancakes and eggs. Ok. This bi*^h got and attitude and started treating us funky because she thought we were sharing my plate! Wait...What?!? The rest of the staff kept staring at us, god knows what she told them-she thought we couldn't afford a meal cuz we had to share so there goes her tip! It was crazy. WRONG THOT!    Got our check and tossed my Discover card at her like girl bye!! Thanks for the effed up service because she didn't have the courtesy to clarify our order. The service here is the worse and they need retraining. That was truly our last time. Ever."}
{"text":"I don't typically like diners but this place rocked. I'm only not giving it 5 stars because the wait time each time I've been here has been super stupid and I know the food us the reason.   Chicken and waffles was good as hell. Strawberry butter and fresh cook to order chicken. Crab cake benedict was exactly what I expected. They also had mimosas1  Strip lot...plenty of parking. It's a diner so diner prices. Friendly services and quick. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Went in with an open mind not knowing what to expect. New place and all. The food was good no complaints but nothing to write home about and a little pricey for what they offer. There are other restaurants that offer the same things that are cheaper very close by and taste the same if not better."}
{"text":"Good food here! Coffee is on point! Large portions so bring someone who's into splitting. Tell em large marge sent you."}
{"text":"First time here with my fianc√© and his cousins, and I actually like how cozy it is. It gives you the feels of back in the 70's/80's. Love their chicken and waffles. It's a must try if you go here!"}
{"text":"Second visit was as delicious and flawless as the first! Metro has definitely earned the title of newest fave local diner in our books!   Get the chicken and waffles $15.99 TRUST! It's a crowd favorite for a reason! I read somewhere they brine their chicken for 24 hours, no wonder those suckers are so moist and flavorful. Portion is huge, served with their signature sweet and spicy sauce. Waffles topped with strawberry butter? Yummmmy  Another pleasant surprise was the Biscuit and Sausage gravy $9.99 Gravy was deliciously on point! Comes with 2 eggs and your choice of hash browns or home style fries. The fries could've used more flavor though.   Crab Benedict $13.99 was fresh with very little filler. The addition of a little heat was a welcomed surprise. Hollandaise sauce was light and very tasty.   Mom had the chicken salad sandwich and chili. She too had nothing but good things to say. Service was timely though it's really busy. The Tropicana location is a bit small so there might be a little wait especially for bigger parties. Can't wait to return and try other things on the menu. Yo Hala, I got my eyes on you! Make me hollah!"}
{"text":"It was featured on Triple D. Don't hold that against then.    This, its first west of the Mississippi serves diner staples along with contemporary takes on Southern diner fare.  Comfort food it is.   The space, unassuming, warm, friendly, comfortable. The food matches the ambience.  This ain't diet food. Butter, fat, cream, copious amounts of salt all used with no apology.  Large, stomach filling portions of stick to the ribs food that will leave you smiling and satisfied.  Beginning with the chicken and waffles, crispy, moist, gently oily fried chicken (and entire half) piled alongside a crispy, gently sweetened, thick waffle.  Spreading the accompanying strawberry butter over the waffle makes it great, adding their sweet, hot sauce over the chicken with some extra maple syrup, fantastic.  The meatloaf, a classic preparation with some fillers, cooked in the oven, sliced thick and griddled, a heaping scoop of buttery, creamy mashed taters slathered in a brown gravy, greasy, seasoned, sauteed summer squash and a few slices of non descript baguette to mop it all up.  Creamy, fatty and all the right ways, aggressively seasoned.  Zero complaints.  The biscuits, flaky yet moist. At a ladle of peppery sausage gravy all over. Oh yeah.  Finally the shrimp and grits. While I prefer creamy grits to cheesy, crisp fried grit cakes (I'm spoiled by the creamy grits in Charleston), I'm not complaining. Grit cakes are plenty moist on the inside and compliment well when drowned in a creamy, rich, gently spiced gravy containing Gulf shrimp, spicy andoule, and peppers.  Chunks of bacon add the All-American finish. Solid.  Friendly off Strip service with a smile.  Solid food, perfect for the once a day feeeding."}
{"text":"Took my boys there for dinner. It was awesome.  My son had the biggest breakfast hamburger I've ever seen in my life. And it defeated him. I had a awesome vegetable avocado wrap and my little guy had what he claims to be the best chicken tenders ever. Sitting outside on a breezy afternoon was a bonus too.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"At first I didn't know what to expect from this restaurant but as soon as I walked in everybody was super nice! I went with my mom and the waitress was super nice and kind. I really like this place bc it makes me think of the 50s but with a very modern look, which I love bc I wasn't alive by that time  but anyways they make you feel welcomed!"}
{"text":"Came for first time today.  Had staple items Belgian Waffle, scrambled eggs and bacon extra crispy.  Excellent.  I had stopped getting Belgian waffles because at most places they just had no flavor.  Not this time!  Service was exceptional and menu has great veriety.  I had the fortune of sitting at bar next to the food staging area.  Saw for myself how yummy the options are."}
{"text":"You know how you're always a little leery to try a new place that has recently opened to eat. Well let me ease your mind on Metro Diner. We have eaten there twice and what a clean, well run restaurant it is and that's not even  mentioning the delicious food they serve. Their Monte Cristo sandwich is huge and has just the right ratio of meat to bread &i it's serve with raspberry jam on the side. Delish! There Chicken and waffle are amazing,  crispy moist chicken and their waffles are served with a scrumptious strawberry butter on top. The staff are a delight, from the ones that meet you at the door to the person that takes your order. Try this place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went here with high hopes with my boyfriend. I'm going to be completely honest here, the whole place smelled very unpleasant and made sitting inside unenjoyable, the waiter was nice though.  I got eggs Benedict and he got an omelette. The eggs Benedict was flavorless and the Canadian bacon on it tasted like a slice out of a low quality package from Wal-Mart. The hash browns that came with it were good, I guess. I paid $12.00 for that. My boyfriend's omlette came with country potatoes which were \"good\" but the omlette was Just kind of flavorless despite it smelling delicious. I was so excited to try this place but my hopes and dreams were shot down as all my hopes and dreams have been. What's up with all these diners charging so much for cheap breakfast food? What happened to $5 breakfast diners? Much disappointment."}
{"text":"This place was going through trial and error when it first opened. My husband works at a store in the shopping center so I provided feedback to the manager on service since we will probably be eating here a lot. She welcomed the feedback and addressed it right away. I came the following week to try them out again and the service and food were amazing. I see some reviews about the prices being too expensive. This isn't a Dennys. Their food quality and portions match what they charge for it. The staff are friendly and the turn around time for food is quite quick. I ordered the loaded potato soup and it was delicious. Not too heavy but loaded with bacon and just enough cheese. For my meal I ordered chicken strips and French fries. It came out a beautiful golden brown and everything was fried to perfection. The price for everything was fair. We will definitely be repeat customers."}
{"text":"My mom and I split the grilled cheese on sourdough burger, it was good & plenty of food to fill both of us! We've gotten good service there everytime we've ate there as well, thank you!"}
{"text":"As a chef I always root for a new place, sadly I am mostly let down, not this time. We went tonight after we left HomeDepot. I knew it had opened but was not sure where. We went in around 6 and were seated right away . My husband ordered Salibury Steak and I had the fish and chips. Both we spot on, I have to say this was the first time ever I ahve gotten actual hand battered fish in Charlotte. The fires were hand cut and crispy, cole slaw great and four pieces of fish. My husband had the Salisbury Steak Special and he cleaned his plate. He said it was hte best he ever had. Now unlike other people I watched the kitchen crew who really have to work in a well orchestrated team or service will go to hell. It was a beautiful scene to seem them all work and follow , fill the orders and expidite. I know not what the average person looks at but to me it only added to the great food. I can't wait to try breakfast (as this area has no good options) I saw some waffles with fesh strawberry butter go by and lunch I saw some beautiful rye bread on plates and I want that next time. Thank you Metro Diner for surpassing my expectations of mediocre food"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat. The chicken and waffles is best ever. My wife got the pot roast and... same thing. The staff is extra friendly and everything is clean and neat. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Best chicken and waffles that I ever had. I was hesitant about the strawberry butter, but it worked well with the chicken and sweet spicy sauce. I was impressed. Our server was super friendly you could tell she really cares about her customers. This was my first time eating here and won't be my last. If you haven't tried it yet, you should."}
{"text":"Great place.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  All the food was fresh.  Our server Tony was was great."}
{"text":"Such a laid back atmosphere, EXTREMELY friendly and helpful staff and the food?????? One word...YUMMY!"}
{"text":"We dined and found it to be just OK. Nancy did like the omelet she had was good. My platter just lacked much flavor- I had Biscuits and Gravy which was rather plain eggs ordered scrambled soft were over cooked. Likely we will try it again."}
{"text":"What a great new addition to the diner scene in Charlotte. Metro diner is fully of delicious menu options that is sure to please a breakfast lover or someone who wants to get a classic sandwich or entree option that only a good diner can serve. The wait time is worth the yummy food. They run specials and have revolving desserts, so make sure to see what is featured on the chalk board. I am sure to return when I am in the area."}
{"text":"First time going here but I'll definitely be back. The portion sizes are so big you'll have lunch and dinner for sure. I had an American omelette with cheese grits and it was all so delicious. I also ordered the sausage, egg and cheese croissant but I didn't come close to finishing it. LOL  We went on a Sunday afternoon during the off hours and they still had plenty of attentive servers floating around. They also have a drink bar you can just walk up to and make your own complimentary drinks including to-go drinks. It's the little things really.   Also shout out to all the homies in the hood who never made it here. I'm living for all of us now. I pour out a little mimosa for the old school."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went here about three weeks ago on a Saturday afternoon. We loved it! The food was delicious! Our waitress, Leslie, treated us like royalty. She did it with a smile. Check this place out  you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food is WORTH THE WAIT! I had the most amazing Huevos Rancheros at the Metro Diner and I have not been able to stop dreaming of them since!  The plate was huge, as was the pile of beans, sausage, veggies, eggs and tortilla shells.  This is absolutely something everyone should try when visiting!  My husband had the Croissant French Toast which was on the sweeter side, but quite good!  We have been back once since and enjoyed lunch here! The Chicken Salad was REALLY good! all white meat chicken and while plain, it totally hit the spot!  I also ordered a side of Mac N Cheese which was so creamy and cheesy and to die for!  I highly recommend you trying this out when you have some time to wait and don't find yourself Hangry before you arrive! ( The wait was almost 45 minutes for two of us on a Sunday morning around 9:45 am)"}
{"text":"Fried chicken and waffles are a must have! Finn our waitress was amazing. Great atmosphere and food, highly recommend"}
{"text":"I came across Metro by accident... best accident ever. Both myself and my girlfriend ordered the chicken and waffles... hands down the best we've had... they give a half a chicken of some of the best fried chicken... it was heaps of food so we did end up giving chicken to a homeless man... 3 full bellys of delicious food... Ohhh and the service was AMAZING!!! Metro Diner will definitely be a stop for us everytime we're I'm Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly busy for a Monday afternoon!  I came for lunch and it was packed.  This is not my type of restaurant, but I came for mom because she had been here before and enjoyed it.  They have beer and wine. And also a specialty drink that maybe changes daily or weekly? Anyway, this day it was peach iced tea. They had two daily soups, I got the broccoli and cheese and it was delicious.   I ordered the avocado wrap and it was not my favorite.  I didn't see any avocado at all.  It had way too much spinach and it also had fried jalape√±os, which were good, but way too much!!! I think they could lighten the spinach, add more fresh avocado, and only a few jalape√±os and it'd be perfect!!!   A little pricey, but not too bad. I may try this place again, but only if mom wants to!! She enjoyed her hamburger steak at least!"}
{"text":"Prices are kind of high for what their offer, the service is terrible, the waitress bring us our check just like 2 min after she brought us our food.  There is a ton of other breakfast places in the area there are cheaper and way better.  There is no way I'm coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"Great classic breakfast!  The food was fast and fresh!  Highly recommend the chicken and waffles with the strawberry butter.  Just the strawberry butter in general is amazing!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch experience here.  Especially notable was the friendly and enthusiastic service I received.  They really know how to make you feel welcome.  And the key is that it was genuine friendliness and enthusiasm; they weren't just going through the motions.  I had the avocado veggie wrap which includes fried jalapenos, carrots, spinach, avocado, sour cream, red onions, cheddar cheese, and chipotle ranch dressing.  It came with your choice of side; I had it with french fries that were cooked to my liking, not too crispy and not undercooked either.  The wrap was excellent! The diet coke I had was really good as well.  Sometimes fountain beverages don't have the proper fizz or don't taste right for some other reason, but this was one of the best diet coke's I've had!    The only negative is for me is that I'm a vegetarian and they don't really have any lunch or dinner choices for the vegetarian other than the aforementioned wrap and a grilled cheese sandwich.  I suppose you could also get a spinach salad and either hold or substitute the bacon for something else.  Another option is to get the macaroni and cheese along with some other side dishes such as cole slaw, sauteed veggies, and fresh fruit.  But otherwise I really loved it and look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to come try Metro Diner and this morning had the opportunity. I ordered the San Francisco Eggs Benedict. It was fresh and delicious. The Hashbrowns were cooked perfectly and the flavored Coffee of the day was Bavarian Chocolate and that just completed the meal. So good!"}
{"text":"Super place to eat. Sometimes too much food. We had a couple of issues with wait staff with not getting the order right but they offered to fix it...enjoy the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place 3 times and I have never been disappointed! Their Ruben sandwich is on point! I can't wait to get back there to try out more of their menu!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the go to spot for a diner. I think this is one the best I've been to. I took the recommendation from our waitress and BTW she is freaking Awesome! I got the fried chicken dinner and it was YUMMY. They definitely do a great fried chicken and the sweet and spicy sauce was simple but good basically maple syrup and hot sauce. I can't wait to go back and try other things. My wife had the turkey burger and she thought it was good. I can't say anything bad about this place so far as everything was done right and I'll be back for sure to try some more eats. Thanks"}
{"text":"Used to working at five star resorts, my roommate and I are trained to give (and spot) exceptional service, and that's exactly what we found at Metro Diner. Even the extremely reasonable 25 minute wait for Sunday brunch was enjoyable in their outdoor space equipped with complimentary coffee.  Gone is the faulty pen-and-pad method of yesteryear. The wait staff here are equipped with iPads that send orders directly to the kitchen. From our seats, we could see behind the counter where the kitchen operated like smooth, Swiss-engineered clockwork. Our food came out hot, fresh, and faster than we could have expected. I highly recommend the pound cake French Toast--but as dessert, rather than an entree!  The meal itself was sublime: delicious diner food, made with fresh ingredients and in generous portions. The service, however, is where Metro really shines. Though the restaurant was packed, we were greeted, seated, and fed in record time. Even our water glasses were kept magically full as if by wonderful, friendly diner fairies.  We've all been to restaurants where servers cater only to their designated sections, and felt ignored when we need help but nobody nearby was assigned to us. Not so at Metro Diner. Every employee who passed by our table here stopped to ask how we were doing, and seemed genuinely interested in the answer.  Metro Diner gives their employees the flexibility to take care of guests instead of following rigid, micromanaged procedures--which can feel insincere and inefficient. When the server dropping off our food realized we had made a sub (home fries instead of hash browns), she brought a replacement in under three minutes, without having to consult the server who took our order, get approval from a manager, or otherwise jump through hoops to make things right.  I don't have a single complaint. Metro Diner exceeded my expectations in every way. Bravo!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The portions are huge and the food is amazing!!! The food is cooked to perfection!! Also the service is amazing. Angela was amazing, very informative and friendly! Will definitely be coming back again!!!"}
{"text":"On our anniversary weekend we dined her for breakfast on our first morning out. It was a wonderful atmosphere and the place was really packed. It was a 35 minute wait for a table of two but we were able to sit within five minutes at the first come first serve counter sea in front of the grille. Our waitress was very pleasant and helpful since we hadn't eaten here before. Our food was prepared in under ten minutes and delivered to us. Our drinks stayed full and our plates were taken away immediately when we finished. Great service especially with the restaurant being so busy. The food was very good and my wife and I will be eating here again very soon. Maybe even during this visit to the Queen City."}
{"text":"Our new local spot for breakfast! We've been twice so far. Everything we've eaten here has been delicious and very big portions! Definitely can be shared by two people (that is if you want to share). The servers are very friendly, attentive, and pleasant. I love their Avocado Veggie Wrap so much! (You can add chicken if you want). My husband ordered the Bold City Burger and it's huuuge! If you are a meat lover, then this is for you because it is double patty! Their Fried Chicken and Waffle definitely lived up to the hype. Crispy and tasty chicken. Will be coming back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This was our 1st time trying this place the waitress was very sweet the service was ok in general I'm giving it 2 starts because of this I ordered white toast I get a biscuits that's 1 , my husband ordered French toast in pound cake batter there was supposed to be 4 of them we got told you only get 2 at breakfast time when there is no such thing on menu 3 when they arrived it was just simple pound cake dipped in sugar and lightly fried no egg nothing  4 honey mustard is mixed with mayo  yuck !!!  We will not be coming back here"}
{"text":"New favorite brunch spot. Great customer service and amazing food. Huge portions!! Especially liked our server as he knew how picky kids can be and suggested the Mac and cheese in lieu of the coleslaw that came with my daughter's lunch. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to Metro Diner (Henderson). We wanted a quick easy bite for breakfast after a long week where I had been ill for a few days. We had tried the one in the southwest part of Vegas and since this is now in walking distance if the need arises to actually walk some where. We arrived and were seated Immediately. Are waiter was really great, I forget his name, but he also works at Black Bear Diner so he was a familiar face. I had simple Sausage and egg breakfast with a side of B & G. Josie had Pancake Breakfast. The order came quickly and we enjoyed our meal. I will have to say the meals are not really stunning as Diner food goes. However, you get a great meal that fills the plate and your stomach. The staff is friendly and the wait for anything is minimal. Price wise it is on average with any diner in Vegas. Thank you for Dining at Metro Diner. We will definitely return here. We would like to try lunch or dinner as well. It is quick and easy to get to and food is good. If in Henderson and you would like a great meal, check them out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"From start to finish a great experience! Everyone enjoyed their food and the service was excellent! I had the Huevos Rancheros which could easily feed 2 people!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how to express my gratitude, though will give it a try.  On the upswing from a bout of Flu that has kept me out of work for days. Finally out of the house to run delayed errands & went to some local \"Southern\" restaurants in hopes of chicken noodle soup....none to be found.  Stopped @ Metro on way home. Again excellence & expectations surpassed. Got the chicken soup, & yes...it did feed my soul.."}
{"text":"Been driving by this place for the past 6 months and finally stopped in and glad I did.  Went in for the Chicken and waffles.  OMG It was amazing. From the perfectly seasoned and fried chicken to the crispy waffles with strawberry butter. I was in food heaven.  Thanks Metro Dinner for a great experience."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously amazing. The wait is usually a long one but so worth the wait. The food is awesome and boy is there plenty of it. The staff are so patient and courteous. Give them a shot, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Came back yesterday and service was great had the American omelette and cheesy grits on the side the grits were cooked to perfection and had great flavor will definitely be back to try the other items!!"}
{"text":"Why oh Why Metro?!?! Been to both this location and the one on west Tropicana service is slow at times but, I overlook it due to how great the food is! This time around we were promptly seated and they had our drinks right away our server came to take our order but tasked for a couple more minutes... We ended up sitting there for 20 minutes until we decided to leave.. so disappointed cause we wanted to try their famous chicken and waffles!! Next time we will just probably order take out to avoid these issues"}
{"text":"Really solid brunch place - clean and modern. Very friendly and informative service. Menu is large and you have a lot of options for lunch or brunch/breakfast. We had to get the chicken and waffles with strawberry butter - really great waffle texture. Chicken was extra crispy, maybe a tad overdone but still great. Their Shrimp and grits were some of the best I have ever had - definitely very crave worthy. Overall excellent little brunch spot. 4.5/5"}
{"text":"My family and I came here for lunch today. We were sat in a timely manner, our order was also taken in a timely manner. My dad and I got one of the daily specials, The Cajun Big Fish. It was excellent. My mom ordered the Metro Club. It was HUGE! She could only eat about a quarter of it but took the rest home. Her fries were cold and extremely salty. It was a bit pricy for lunch. Might come back again as I work in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go to Metro Diner the other night, it would be his first time. I have been before but to the location on Ft. Apache. This was my first time at this location. Our server Summer was really great! She had a great personality. I was a little taken back because the restaurant was a little grimy. I guess on the website it's says they will always open the door. We walked in and the hostess was involved in something else, not a customer. To sit us she takes us to a booth by the bathroom, which I didn't like. There  were others tables available. The booth had not been cleaned and the floor was very slippery. I asked if we could sit somewhere else and she sat us in the front at a table we had passed earlier. This one not too clean either. The food was good but this visit left a bad taste in my mouth. Not sure if I would go back to this location.  They need to get it together! I don't remember seeing any bus boys. Hmmmm"}
{"text":"Great and speedy service, good food, some creative dishes, big portions, and the food is not overly salted, at least the meals my husband and I had. As we are close to Thanksgiving, they offer a meal that consists of a large waffle made with stuffing, covered with mashed potatoes made with real potatoes and lots of turkey and gravy, plus cranberry. It was huge!   We are definitely going back and I want to try some of their breakfast dishes."}
{"text":"The breakfast was fabulous. For me, great food is the price of entry. The service was outstanding and earned 5 stars in my book. A very nice greeting, my server Hannah was awesome  and the manager stopped by to check on everything and was also very welcoming. A great start to my day. Thank you Metro Diner staff"}
{"text":"Be still my heart. This is a wonderful well run establishment with a variety of great food. I sat at the counter and had the chance to see a ton of food come out. Everything looked phenomenal. The trainer on duty ensured that every order was correct, which I appreciated because sometimes you wonder how orders go so wrong. Not here. They care and three eyeballs go on each order. The server, the cook, and the person working the window.  I had a waffle with berries as well as a mimosa. Fresh berries, Yaaaay!!! Both were delicious and served very quickly. I returned with my dad and again everything was correct and served quickly. My dad was impressed by the portion of the food. I'm excited to have this establishment so close to home for good eats throughout the day. I'm sure to become a regular."}
{"text":"So happy the Metro Diner opened in Mathews which was badly needing something like this.  Good old home cooked tasting meals at reasonable prices. You can get breakfast, lunch or dinner anytime of the day.   My wife had the regular chicken pot pie which was still pretty big and there is a jumbo if you're really hungry.  It was fantastic.  Loaded with fillings and chicken if you like chicken pot pie it's a must try.   I had the pot roast which was also really good.  Comes with mashed potatoes and some vegetables. The pot roast was so tender I could cut it with a fork.   Pretty good service although our server kinda disappeared for a bit but no big deal. Everything that was coming from the kitchen looked really good and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Move over Denny's! This diner is great!! They have a great system in here. Food gets cranked out fast as they have a small window for food to sit and the runners/servers stay ready. I don't think we waited 10 minutes for our food to come out. Corned beef and poached eggs were on point. I will definitely come here again when coming out to Vegas."}
{"text":"Rock my mommas balls this place is amazing.  One of the best little diners I've ever tried can't wait to come back and try again first time diner long time customer"}
{"text":"so we have been to another location and it was Excellent-so when this one opened up we were excited to go....well only open like two months and needs some uumph! The place only had three tables at dinner -again only open recently but in a Very busy shopping center-also a known name. Well the service was okay but they had three servers and at least four cooks on, Saying this as there was plenty of staff to wow anyone! I had the Special Stuffing Waffle which was good but the \"Roasted\" Turkey was sliced deli meat and the potatoes while being made fresh were bland and the gravy was from a can for sure.My wife's sandwich and soup combo - white bread was hard -not toasted-hard and her soup was putty! yes we could literally stand a spoon in it foe indefinite amounts of time. The manager she duid the right thing by offering to replace it. My wife is refused and she actually took it of the check so kusod to that. In Las Vegas you have to be on your game all the time. We are a food town and okay isn't okay you should have great food!"}
{"text":"Okay, you don't feel like cooking today right? If you just miss moms or Grammys cooking? Well this is it! It's almost the same as home cooked except your dining with some people. They do have a pretty good selection of food here. Breakfast is awesome I've have tried a few items here. Oh my, if I did eat meat, ( I'm pescatarian) Id be down to eat the huge chicken and waffles I see come around! Man every time I see that plate I just wanna get down with it but... anyways! My breakfast experience here is just soooooo good. I just never really had the chance to yelp it till today ! Well... try it you'll love it ! Happy Morning eating! Happy happy joy joy! :)"}
{"text":"Great new and hot place to try! Food was delicious, and portions were on the larger size. Kitchen is open which I always like. Our server was very friendly as was the manager. We left feeling very pleased and will absolutely return to explore more options on the menu!"}
{"text":"4 STARS ALL FOR THAT BIG FISH SANDWICH!  I got the fried fish sandwich for brunch and it was EVERYTHING!  The fish was very fresh.  I think that's probably all I would order from here on.  Breakfast is so so.  We tried this spot when we lived in Jax too and the breakfast was never all that.  So I would definitely come here for just lunch or dinner.   They could also use a little more friendly waitresses, the hostess and managers were the only happy faces."}
{"text":"First time trying their new location for a dinner take out. Ordering was easy and the staff was friendly and helpful when I picked up. Chicken was very good as was the Philly cheesesteak. Will have to give a dine in breakfast a try in the future."}
{"text":"Great Diner feel. Good service with a smile. Chicken was delicious, tender, moist and crunchy. (Try the spicy sweet sauce) Waffles were better than average. Greek omelette was ok.. All in all, I'll eat here again.."}
{"text":"New place. Great concept, cute place. Little bit more upscale that typical diner. Our server was Liz and she was personable and knowledgable. Coffee better than most places. I was able to get half order of my breakfast and able to swap out my regular grits for cheese grits. Frank got eggs and hash browns ordered crispy and bacon. Hash browns came out a little too browned. They were quick to get replacement, brought out by one of the partners, Kenny.. They forgot the toast, brought out by Kenny again. Our eggs were cooked perfectly but barely warm. My grits were kinda bland, had melted cheddar on top. I felt like everything needed salt, except the biscuits and gravy. They are second best I've had. Overall, service was great, management went above and beyond in picking up our tab. I'd definitely try again when some of the kinks got worked out. Everyone deserves a second chance at redemption and I gotta feeling this place is gonna be off the chain.  Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Autumn was our server. She was awesome. Very detailed on menu discriptions without going on to  long. Stop by the table just enough to ensure that we are doing well.  Avocado toast was sooooooo good."}
{"text":"Very cute place. The food was good and large portions. The wait on Saturday morning was about 45 though."}
{"text":"Have to lower it to a 4. The pancakes are just okay. The strawberries were also not fresh at all. The best part of my meal was apple juice. The door between the indoor and outdoor seating also slammed every five seconds. The 4 (opposed to 3) is due to past experiences."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch and breakfast. They are great with larger groups and usually get food out quickly. I've been here a total of 2 times on the weekend and one during the week. Obviously going in on the weekday was a shorter wait and a calmer atmosphere. During the weekends and brunching hours be prepared for at least a 40 minute wait. They offer a wide variety of options from Delicious omelets (which is what I usually order) to chicken and waffles that are amazing and the usual pancakes eggs and toast breakfast. My fianc√© ordered the eggs Benedict the last time we were in and he fell in love with the sauce. He can be very picky about making accurate Benedict sauce and according to him they nailed it! The food is definitely delicious and you get a lot of food which is always a plus. Lots of great sides and big portions to fill you up and keep you fueled for most of the day. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly, if your looking for chicken and waffles, this is the place!!! They even have strawberry butter w/ little pieces of strawberry & they make a spicy syrup for the chicken & waffles. Sooooo YUM"}
{"text":"In town from LA and we decided to stop by this joint and honestly it was amazing!! Best decision we made. We yelped it before coming and the food looked amazing. Nothing compared to actually tasting it. The food was AMAZING, the portions were GREAT. The service was really FAST!! Our server name was Michelle and she was so sweet & so attentive. Recommend this place if you guys are looking for a good breakfast !"}
{"text":"OMG this is going to be one of my most frequent places. I love this little spot on Pineville Matthews road. The menu is large because they offer brunch basically as well as breakfast and dinner. Mimosas and beer are options as well as wine. The portion sizes are unbelievable I promise the chicken and waffles plate had a half of chicken on it. The dinner is not a loud space even though its not a huge space. Our food was really good I had the holy davoli burger but changed it to turkey check out the pics it had egg on it which was a extra buck but worth it. the burger was in between two grilled cheese sandwiches with slaw tomato and bacon. The sandwich was huge of course I couldn't eat it all. My brother got the breakfast burger which had hash browns and egg on it he almost killed over trying to eat it all. check out the pics to see the food. My next trip im going to try the berry stuffed French toast"}
{"text":"This was our second time here after the first fail. We decided to give it a second chance. Wasted more money and time. It's a shame to walk out of a restaurant hungry because you didn't enjoyed what you were served. Service wasn't very good also starting with the young man taking names at the front door and ending with the wait staff. Served hot pancakes and toast without any butter or syrup. I really don't think they care."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we absolutely loved the spicy chicken Benedict! Could be a little spiced but the gravy was delicious!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Food was amazingly yummy and huge portions.  Took a friend and husband in less than 3 days of each other.  Staff were awesome and the food was great!!! Two thumbs up for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit, the first being a yelp elite event, and my wife's first visit. I remembered how awesome the food was during my last time here and I was very eager to share this with my wife.   It was weird that all day I had a craving for chicken and waffles, so when she let me know she wanted a big, juicy burger, I knew where to go.   The service that night was awesome. Our waitress was very attentive, helpful, and kind. She was definitely top notch!   The chicken and waffles were cooked to perfection. They were actually better than I remembered them. Let me tell you, few things are better than getting exactly what you want. That meal hit the spot.  My wife loved her burger, as well. She had enough left over for lunch the next day. She said she was impressed with Metro Diner and looks forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"After seeing an add for this place on Instagram, I decided to try this place out, and OMG was I glad that I did!!  My future sister-in-law and I stopped here after church one Sunday to enjoy a late breakfast/ brunch.  When we arrived, we were greeted immediately by a happy and friendly host. Upon being seated the hostess mentioned the daily specials.  Metro Diner offers a variety of food choices, even specials of the day that are written on the chalk board.  Our server came right over, and took our drink order and asked if we have any questions.  Our server provided a few recommendations and then left us to ponder our order (while we decided what we really wanted to eat, since everything sounded so good!).  Once our waiter returned, I ordered the chicken and waffles and my future sister-in-law ordered an omelet.  The food arrived very quickly, hot and fresh.  The chicken tasted just like my mom used to make it, and the waffle was extra buttery and fluffy.  Not to mention the strawberry butter was out of this world!  I can honestly say, that I have not had meal this good in Las Vegas in a long time.  I am defiantly a fan and will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!! I don't remember ever having such excellent service anywhere. At this place, if your drink is at half, it gets filled. Not necessarily by the wait staff in charge of your table either. It gets filled by the first person to walk past and see it.  I have been here twice already and I am always pleased with the service and the food.  You get a good portion of food for what you pay for, and it's always great quality.  I always get their chicken n' waffles with strawberry butter and OMG is it simply amazing!  The waffle is hot, fresh and flaky.  The chicken is hot, juicy and fresh.  I have never received an over cooked and burnt piece of chicken. It's a good place, take your family here once on a weekend, worth it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately went for lunch with a large family about a week ago- ALL of our meals were mediocre-  Went another time, but this time for a simple breakfast.... bacon - eggs and some straight out of the bag potatoes  This will definitely be the final time. *how can anyone mess up breakfast?....  well, they found a way."}
{"text":"I love the Menu and the dinner look. The music is decent and the staff are friendly! Rachel is our waitress and she's a sweetheart. They have a nice set up in here!!! Just check out the pix. I love the vibe in this place. Definitely for locals that want to give there guest a nice place to"}
{"text":"This diner was an unexpected surprise.   I went to get my car service early on a Saturday and wanted to grab some breakfast so of course I did a quick search and saw this place had some pretty good reviews. We arrived around 9:30AM and waited to be seated about 5 minutes before our table was ready.  The restaurant was already buzzing with the Saturday morning rush.   The waitress came to our table and took our drink orders. She came back twice and there was so many options on the menu I couldn't make up my mind. I finally settled on the Western Omelet, Cheese Grits, and a Biscuit. We waited for about 25 minutes for our food which I thought was a little long for breakfast but they were really busy and I had some time to burn so I wasn't that concerned. The waitress checked in with us and told us it would be ready soon.   When the omelet arrived, I thought I had too much in my omelet and wouldn't like it but man was I wrong. The omelet was delicious with nice chunks of ham. The cheese grits had cheese on the top and they were good...but then I realize there was also cheese on the bottom and by stirring them up a bit they were even better. Lastly, take my advice.... get the biscuit. The biscuit was freshly made and falling apart. I have seriously been craving this buttery, soft yet crunchy biscuit since I first taste it. I placed jelly on the biscuit and it was even better. I honestly could have just ordered a biscuit and been happy.   As we were leaving there were a lot more people waiting so I could tell we got there at a good time. If you are going on a Saturday morning perhaps get there before 10AM. I know they are building another location a little closer to me so I definitely will be visiting again.....for the biscuits of course."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast at Metro Diner - our first time here, and we were not impressed. I ordered classic eggs Benedict. There's a whole menu for them so I thought I'd be good. One egg was way over cooked, and the other was way under. How does that happen? The hollandaise was bland, the English muffin was stale, and the tiny piece of Canadian bacon couldn't save it.   My husband had a croissant breakfast sandwich and did not enjoy it. He also said it was stale, with fake cheese, and bland. He got a side of fruit thinking at least that will be good. Nope. The fruit was frozen solid, and he could barely eat any of it.    Next time I'm going to suck it up and drive the 35 minutes to Cafe Monte for a real, good brunch experience."}
{"text":"Originally opened in 1992 in Jacksonville Florida and described as \"Where the Locals Eat\" ever since, it was entirely by accident that it was discovered that Metro Diner had recently expanded to the Las Vegas Suburbs, ongoing discussion about who was doing a 'true' Monte Cristo Sandwich in the local market bringing up results for a familiar name just a few minutes away that had not been there just last month.  Not to be mistaken for Metro Pizza, though both they and the Diner chain now with nearly two-dozen locations show a similar commitment to Scratch-made classics invigorated by contemporary techniques and great ingredients, it was just past 8:15am on Saturday that a party of three entered the converted former drive-thru Burger joint now decorated as a cozy space with checkered floors and green tables, a few televisions showing Sportscenter as early 2010's Pop hits flittered overhead.  Arriving before most of the crowd and greeted by local Operating Partner Tony Alonge, whose name had been passed along from corporate after an E-mail inquiring as to whether the Monte Cristo was available at Breakfast since the online menu seems to indicate otherwise, it was at a sizable four-top next to the kitchen that seating was offered and menus presented, the servers with an ever-present smile that almost seemed contagious throughout the morning - a few of them even passing their limited free time dancing and singing along to the music.  Featuring a sizable menu, though not the outlandish 'everything to everyone' mishmash of some, it was after some perusal and questions about sourcing that a relatively sizable order was placed including a few half-size plates allowed in order to sample more variety, the total cost of just over $70 still a bargain considering all that was entailed and easily a place where a check less than $15 per person would be realistic as an average.  Honing recipes now for nearly 25 years, each restaurant offering similar classics plus several specials that change from week to week, it was with Coffee and Water poured and kept filled that the meal quickly got underway, a miscommunication about wanting items sent out in rounds soon seeing the whole table flooded with eight plates that made it difficult to taste everything while still warm, the Pound Cake French Toast, for instance, saved till last and at that point just above room temperature which made it difficult to get a sense of how good it might have been piping hot and more capable of melting the butter.  Moving on to items better assessed hot from the kitchen, a one-and-one Benedict featuring housemade Hollandaise, Canadian Bacon and Vegetables beneath medium-poached Eggs atop toasted English Muffins as good as most in the city alongside nicely fried Hash Browns, Metro Diner's Fried Chicken and Waffles proved very impressive considering the price point, a half-order of the bone-in Bird plump and juicy with a good spice profile served with supple Waffles and a scoop of Strawberry Butter.  Not offering the option for Pure Maple Syrup, but instead creating their 'signature' sweet and spicy Sauce tableside by combining Crystal Hot Sauce with Warm 'syrup,' it was with good fortune that neither the aforementioned Pound Cake nor the signature \"Yo Hala on The Square\" Stuffed French Toast required any additional garnishment, the thick slices of Challah Bread stuffed with Strawberries and Cream Cheese making for one tasty weekly special beneath a liberal ladle of warm Strawberry Compote.  Not particularly impressed by the \"Cheesiest Grits,\" even the addition of a layer of Cheddar both top and bottom leaving the grains a bit runny and flavorless without adding salt, Metro Diner's Buttermilk Biscuits feature the drop-style common throughout most of Florida and are well flavored with light sours of Buttermilk, the addition of a Honey-Glazed Chicken Plank to make a $4.79 Sandwich well worth it for those not wanting to invest in the whole Chicken and Waffles plate.  Speaking finally on the Monte Cristo, most versions in town either outright lying by serving a French Toast Sandwich or bastardizing the original recipe by omitting the Turkey, Metro Diner finally gives Las Vegas what so many have been requesting for years, the soft Sourdough Batter-dipped and deep-fried around a thick stack of two deli-Meats, Cheddar and American Cheese with almost no residual oil plus a big bowl of Raspberry Preserves at its side.  Using the same light Batter to coat the Onion Rings as that on the Monte Cristo, it was with compelling words offered by the chalkboard at the back of the room that Dessert became necessary, the Salty Caramel Brownie served warm with a big ball of Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and Chocolate drizzle while the Key Lime Pie is imported straight from Jacksonville for the sake of consistency, anyone familiar with the debate certain to be amused by Whipped Cream offered on the side, but certainly not on top of, the generous and tangy slice."}
{"text":"I know diners, I'm a NYer;)   It's not about being fancy, or necessarily upscale. Metro is about serving good, regular food. I just wish it was open 24 hours & would serve disco fries.  Ok, those are fries with BROWN gravy & melted mozzarella:) Metro serves up piping hot generous portions and at lighting speed.  Another thing one can bank on is friendly and fast service!  They have pretty damn good coffee, plain or choice of hazelnut.  Nope, no blue plastic creamer containers for the hazelnut- the hazelnut has its own pot of coffee! Insert clapping hand emojis please.  I built my own omelet, and it was cooked perfectly with my choice of saut√©ed onions, asparagus, mushrooms and melted Swiss.  Excellent, neat and plated oh so nicely.  I did keep eyeing other people's choices (dishes, yes I eyed all dishes leaving that kitchen)!  Next time, that apple French toast with almonds is Mine!!  I will share, but only share the picture of it:). Our waitress was quite the server with one of he best dispositions of polite.  I have her warning, asked permission and snapped a picture of her and posted it here on Yelp!"}
{"text":"Someone wise one time said you only have one time to make a good impression. My first time at the diner. Full disclosure it was right after church so it was quite busy. Waited 25 minutes for the table. Once we got to the table the server pointed over to what was supposed to be a beverage bar. My question was if I'm tipping you 20% to wait on the table, don't you need to bring my beverage to me? Once the order was taken it took 25 minutes to get the food, when we receive the food we could tell that it had set in the window for quite some time. Fries were rubbery and cold and my reuben sandwich was cold but edible. One person at the table had breakfast and she said it was delicious one had chicken pot pie and said it was average."}
{"text":"Was my second time eating here and still had a great experienced Service was very fast and staff members always checked on us Throuhout our dine. Ordered their special, blueberry crape and this is to die for , love and enjoyed every bite. My husband ordered steak and eggs and said he enjoyed it, finished everything except for toast bread . Locals and non-locals should try this place!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times so far and this is my new goto spot on the weekends for breakfast/brunch.  The staff is friendly and accommodating, this is always appreciated.  We almost tried eating at a new place in the area this afternoon (where Fuddruckers used to be) until I read all the reviews regarding their service.  Makes me appreciate a place that has friendly people who have their system down pat.  On to the food.  I've never had a bad meal here.  The Eggs Benedict is awesome and is something I could eat at any time of day.  Today I had the biscuits and gravy with 2 poached eggs on the side (which I pop on top of the biscuits).  It was very good.  The gravy is light and creamy, less salt that I prefer but I imagine its healthier than the gravy I make (with bacon grease and butter).  I like this restaurant because they have a good down-home dishes they do really well and many of their dishes have a higher end feel to them due to attention to detail and quality ingredients with a slight twist (good quality baguette/texas toast, fresh cut avocado, fried jalapeno slices, strawberry butter, homemade soups, etc).  They get all the little details right and that makes the food good.  They do all that right with the food yet the diner feel is cozy and casual and not some high-priced stuffy eclectic hipster joint.  We will be back."}
{"text":"A very average chain restaurant with staff in need of training. We stopped in for a late lunch and ordered the chicken pot pie and meatloaf.  The pot pie was a disaster. The crust was not cooked through and was doughy inside. The chicken was cold and the remainder tasted like wallpaper paste. The meatloaf was OK but far from delicious . We sent back the pot pie and asked for a second meat loaf.  Before the new meal arrived we were presented with a check from our clueless server.  This restaurant is nothing special.  The manager did her best to apologize and even picked up our check and sent us away with a coupon towards a future visit. It will be a long time before we try this place again."}
{"text":"Great food. Large portions.  I had the 1/2 fried chicken. The meat loaf was also ordered at my table. Both were excellent. Service was great and prompt. They didn't seem to mind us sitting awhile while we talked after eating."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast diner with simple but delicious choices with a twist. We had the chicken and waffles which was a generous four pieces of chicken and a fluffy waffle. The avocado breakfast special was also an awesome choice and should be a regular menu option."}
{"text":"Ok. Menu alone makes you want to return again and again! Any menu with chix and waffles, pot pie, meatloaf and ruebens is a winner in my book.  I had chix and waffles and wife had pot pie. They were both fantastic! Granted my chix and waffles was the sexier dish to look at, but the pot pie held her own....  We ordered a meatloaf to go so will provide updates.  The service was personal and attentive. Team effort with individualized care. Met the managing owner briefly and all employees were concerned in making our visit pleasant and delicious. Fully successful!  Jan J"}
{"text":"That was an awesome breakfast experience. Food was delicious and the service was superb, friendly and attentive. The chicken and waffles are MUST HAVE because they are to die for."}
{"text":"Are you searching for a new breakfast, lunch, or dinner joint? Do you enjoy Crab Cake Benedict or a pancake as big as your head? Do you wonder why no one else has thought of making a challah bread French toast stuffed with bananas, brown sugar, cream cheese, and hazelnut syrup and topping it with a blueberry strawberry compote? Have you ever dreamt about a salad topped with a generous portion of NY Strip  steak, French fries, and blue cheese crumbles?  If you answered 'YES' to any of the questions above you need to check out Metro Diner!! It's what Denny's & IHOP want to be and what Hash House used to be!! If you haven't been here, get here!! If you've been here, get back here!! It truly will be, \"Where the Locals Eat\"!!"}
{"text":"Whom ever is giving Metro Diner less than 5 stars has lost their mind! Great food great price, more than fair on quantity and the service is tops. I hate to give them a great review because it will make everyone go buy hey the truth is it's the best meal in Huntersville and the surrounding area. Outs Famous Toastery to shame!"}
{"text":"I've long since accepted my fate as a basic...person...and as such, have pretty strong opinions on brunch. Since I moved, I've been really looking forward to trying this place. It absolutely exceeded my high expectations.   My boyfriend and I sat at the bar in front of the kitchen, so we were able to see every dish as it came out. Every single item I saw looked like the best possible quality it could be. The best looking eggs, the best looking home fries, a pile of perfectly cooked chicken and golden, crisp waffles. I didn't see any dish that looked average.  We ordered the huevos rancheros and the corn beef hash with a biscuit. We completely gorged ourselves because we couldn't stop eating. Both dishes were pretty massive. I can't imagine anyone leaving this place not sated.   Our food was amazing. We will definitely be going back, and hopefully soon. Also, yelp says they don't serve alcohol, but they do. We had a mimosa and bloody mary. The mimosa was great, the bloody mary was so-so, but with some Texas Pete it was passable."}
{"text":"We tried this on a whim because I was craving a diner-style burger and it did not disappoint. There were five people in my party and everyone liked what they ordered and we all ordered something different. And the portions are huge! The rest of the menu looks amazing and the service was great--can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Staff is great. Service is great. I don't recommend the fish and chips. Fish is not the typical beer battered and very bland, no flavor."}
{"text":"Was great first 2 times, has started to fade. Service is great except lately my orders have been missed miserably. Dishes come out at different times, so not all members eat together.  Have started looking for another go to plac3."}
{"text":"This review is based on: shrimp and grits (okay), chicken and waffles (good) and huevos rancheros (good.)  The service is great,  but the food is okay... I'd give a 3.5, but yelp doesn't allow half stars. You'll definitely feel full (very generous portions,) by the time you finish (if you finish.) But don't expect a culinary  \"experience. \" At the end of the day,   it's  a franchised diner.  I would, however,  go back to try other items that sparked my interest (like the pound cake french toast,) ... stay posted"}
{"text":"This is my second review.  My first review was 5-stars, but I feel obligated to have a disclaimer  My wife, son and daughter were there today for lunch. We have been there probably a dozen times or so and have always loved the food and service - but this time was bad  While delivering the food to the table, the waitress was guiding the 'deliverer' by saying one plate goes where.  For my wife's meal she said 'And that goes to the old lady'. She didn't say it loudly, but all three of my family members heard it.   Not that it makes any difference, but my wife is 52 and probably looks mid 40's at most (not a gray hair on her head).  Obviously my wife was quite upset (BUT STILL TIPPED).  The waitress was a young blonde female and is in the wrong line of work!"}
{"text":"I ordered the fried chicken dinner. The chicken was well prepared and delicious. However, the accompanying mashed potatoes were not hot. By the time I got the attention of a waitperson to correct the problem, I finished my chicken. Furthermore, the subsequent order of mashed potatoes was luke warm. I may give them 2nd chance."}
{"text":"Came to opening day today with my dad. He had the Philly cheese sandwich and I had their fish sandwich. We also ordered one tea and a regular coffee. The sandwiches are really quite large and will satisfy even the biggest eaters. The fish sandwich was even larger than the Philly and I picked the mac and cheese as the side. The fish was perfectly cooked with lettuce, tomatoes and tartar sauce. The tartar sauce is a sweeter tartar sauce so keep that in mind but they do put the sauce on the side. The taste was amazing...no complaints!. The service was also excellent and we never asked for anything. When we left and walking to the car, I dropped my coffee. A waiter saw this happen and brought me a coffee outside! Great service! The cost isn't the cheapest but worth it. We paid $27.00 plus tip for the above."}
{"text":"I'll admit that I was a bit skeptical about this new place at first, but it is a great addition to the area!  Since opening, I've frequented the place at least once a week.  I've come by so many times, that I know the names of most of the staff members at this location.  The restaurant is always clean, and the food is great!  I haven't had a bad experience since it has opened, and will continue to return.    Even though they opened a location on Rainbow and Warm Springs which is closer to me, I still choose to come to this one, since I have such a connection to the staff! :-)"}
{"text":"Great food, HUGE portions and a good price, plus the service was OUTSTANDING. A very enjoyable restaurant. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"fried chicken plate is excellent, and wait staff are super friendly. got a takeout order and it was ready on time and well packaged. a fantastic diner true to the genre."}
{"text":"We went there three weeks ago for breakfast.  Very good!  Today we went there for lunch!  Very bad!  The girl who took our order came back with our drinks and before you know it, some guy was delivering our French Toast!   The bread was soggy and the syrup was watered down!  Who does that!  Is maple syrup so expensive that places have to water them down?  We were never asked if everything was ok - nada - zippo.  The girl came by as she was dropping drinks off at another table and dropped off our check.  Never asked us if everything was ok - if we wanted anything else - didn't notice we left half our meal  Our bill was $23.77 - a total waste  - and that is what we left.  No tip!    Won't be going back there anymore.  Lousy food and crappy service."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here to Metro Diner, I was with a group of 4 (and a half, child under two) and immediately we were brought to a table, one chair was removed and replaced with a high chair. Super impressed! As a mom w/ a young child, nothing is more difficult than going out to eat and highchairs being unavailable or servers who very clearly \"hate\" children. Our server, Alexa (I believe her name was), was incredible! Not only was she super attentive to our table, she was also extremely considerate of my child-- when asking what beverage for my child, I said apple juice and before I could even request, she said \"half apple juice, half water\"  Best server ever! The food was amazing, so fresh and everything was warm. Their coffee of the day, Bavarian Chocolate, very tasty! Overall, it was fantastic! I definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast, my only complaint way too many staff waiting around for nothing to do almost makes you uncomfortable. The bacon was wonderful, eggs great and buttermilk mmmm mmmm mmm good. Nice seeing companies that are growing spread wings in Vegas.  I heard 4 or a total of 4 in Vegas so get ready everyone as this may replace dennys for sure and possibly IHOP"}
{"text":"The Chicken and Waffles were excellent. I have been to Roscoe's in California but  I have to be honest, I like these more. Try them you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter brought me to Metro Diner for brunch. She ordered the chicken and waffles and when she started pouring hot sauce into her maple syrup, I thought she was crazy. Boy was I wrong! The chicken tasted absolutely divine in the spicy syrup mixture! Her waffles were very light and crispy. I opted for a healthier avocado wrap and I was not disappointed. Our waiter (I believe he said his name was Javi), was very patient, pleasant, and welcoming. I'm going to get the chicken and waffles on my next visit!"}
{"text":"If you've been to a real diner, this won't impress you. The service here was poor. We waited a while for a table and then even longer for food and the check. This is not an authentic diner."}
{"text":"First visit to this location.  Service was prompt once they realized I was seated. Breakfast pie was good as always.  Too bad fruit was not an option as a side w/o an upcharge, especially when it was visibly cut several days before. Still, good breakfast/brunch place."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! We have been enjoying Metro Diner in Florida for years and was hoping that the quality, taste and service would continue in Las Vegas and we were very pleased to that to be the case. We would recommended Metro Diner for any palette so, give them an opportunity it's to wow you."}
{"text":"I have to say for my first time here, I was pretty impressed. Upon arriving, it looked like a ton of people so we thought we'd have have a wait but to our surprise we were seated right away. The menu was huge with lots of things to choice from, almost too big. I got chicken and waffles with a side of hash brown. My chicken was amazing, crispy well seasoned and so juicy and moist. Waffles were fluffy and the strawberry butter was a really nice touch. My chicken wasn't all ready at once so they brought me 2 pieces and as my other pieces were finishing they brought me the rest. I didn't have a problem with that because at least I had something to eat  and I wasn't just staring at everyone else while they ate. However, the chicken took so long the waitress gave us our bill before I even got the rest my chicken. obviously I felt rushed so I just asked for a box to take the rest home. Unfortunately, the chicken wasn't good reheated, skin got soggy and oil piled up on the bottom of the chicken and speaking of left overs- waffles aren't really good the next day, the texture was completely gone. My husband got the monte cristo, it sounded really good and looked amazing coming out, but realistically it's a fried mess. Not much meat or cheese on the sandwich, just bread x3 and batter, and again tasted gross reheated the next day. Realistically, I can't knock stars for food not being good for left overs, but for the fact that my entire meal didn't come out before my check- I can't give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Day 1: Went for breakfast. Outstanding! To begin with, the service is excellent. Everyone is very friendly and very attentive. Secondly, the prices are right! It's nice to see a diner with great food and reasonable prices. The food: I ordered a breakfast combination of two eggs, bacon, grits, toast, and a short stack of pancakes. I asked for the eggs to be over medium and they were perfect. They asked if I wanted cheese grits instead of regular grits and I said yes: they were amazing! Just as good as New Orleans! They also asked if I wanted to have any fruit added to my pancakes so we added blueberries...These additions were at no additional charge. The toast is made with very good bread, whole-wheat, and fresh. The bacon was absolutely delicious. Please know that my friend got the sausage patties instead of the bacon and she thought it was just OK so I would go with bacon if you have a choice. The pancakes were good... I cannot say they were outstanding as I have had way better pancakes at other places, but they were good. In the near future, I would not order the pancakes with the rest of the meal. Coffee, hazelnut coffee, is awesome. This place rocks! We are so going back for breakfast repeatedly and I would recommend it to anyone. I have heard that the chicken and waffles are amazing and I have also heard that they have an amazing Charleston shrimp and grits dish. Highly recommended and this place is going to be huge... There is no doubt in my mind that it will quickly get to the point where you will have to lineup to get a table because it is that good. Highly recommended.  Day 2: breakfast was so good on Saturday that we decided to also come on Sunday. This time, I ordered the Greek omelette which came with three beautifully cooked eggs with fresh feta cheese as well as tomatoes and spinach, with whole wheat toast and cheesy grits. Outstanding! Once again, the hazelnut coffee was a major winner. My friend ordered the western omelette and it was also fantastic. Her son ordered the pigs in a blanket which is pancakes rolled around sausage and he said it was phenomenal, along with hashbrowns. Her daughter ordered the 'Yo Challah', apparently featured on triple D's. It is challah bread with sweet cream cheese and blueberry compote and other ingredients... very sweet and we were not impressed but still a phenomenal restaurant. We are so coming back here and this place is amazing. Easily top five in Las Vegas for breakfast."}
{"text":"Whether it is breakfast, lunch, or dinner, this place is fantastic. Easily one of the best for breakfast in Las Vegas. I have been here over 10 times and not once have they disappointed.  The food is delicious, the service is outstanding, the prices are more than reasonable.  The location is easily accessible and in a good area.  From the chicken and waffles, to their salads, to their huge variety of breakfast items that are all amazing, you cannot go wrong.  It is family friendly. They really are all about great customer service.  I will say that, as a local, I have been to the strip a lot for breakfast and brunch. Metro diner makes all these places look average! Very highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place took me by surprise. I wasn't sure I was going to like it, but I did!  First things first, customer service was great! We were greeted immediately and were told to choose any table we'd like. Deanne came over to get our drink order then came back to explain the specials of the day. She took great care of us and made sure we were enjoying our food. Make sure to ask for her!   I was torn between the crab cake benedict and the fried chicken and waffles. They convinced me to get the waffles and I regret nothing. On top of the Belgian waffles was a dollop of strawberry butter -- yum yum!! The waffles were fluffy, chicken had flavor (not dry!), and Deanne made this sweet and spicy sauce for me to dip everything in -- syrup and Louisiana hot sauce, so simple!   My friend ordered one of the day's specials: French toast. She added bananas and chocolates on top. It also came with many other things -- eggs, sausage patties, and toast (or grits). She was hesitant about the grits but wanted to be adventurous. Deanne assured her that if she didn't like it, she could bring her something else -- such great customer service!   The French toast wasn't to die for. The fried chicken and waffles were delicious mostly because of the strawberry butter and sweet and spicy syrup. If I come back, I'm getting that again!"}
{"text":"A regular neighborhood Diner, with huge food portions. You will have a left over box to take home. Okay parking good service, friendly staff. If you like American Diner food this is your kind of place.  Since I cannot eat heap of food, or anything deep fried this is not my kind of restaurant. But if you are hungry and want a nice friendly place to sit and eat this is a good place."}
{"text":"The service here is amazing. The staff is very knowledgeable about the entire menu. It was only my first time here but I would differently come back again."}
{"text":"Food tasted okay had the spicy chicken Benedict  and was not that spicy they left out my bacon and my green onion on top told me a manager was coming over no manager showed up I guess I'm a 6-4 300 lb black guy nobody wanted to talk to me about messing up my food but it was okay I will return service was great"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot! We have been looking for a really good local restaurant. The hash browns were incredible, light golden brown on both sides & NOT greasy! Bacon cooked to perfection. The croissant French Toast was good. We will definitely be back. I'm anxious to try their pot roast for dinner."}
{"text":"The diner was packed but was efficiently ran, diners were in & out. Great food at great prices. Monique was our server and she was one of the best! She had a positive attitude and awesome service! I also noticed other patrons commenting on great service.  1. Chicken & Waffle's way better than Yard Bird, without the heavy cost. Chicken crispy and tender, love the strawberry butter.  2. Western omelette, is solid, can't go wrong.   Perfect brunch for a perfect Father's Day. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"So we came last week for the first time. My husband and I enjoy breakfast and usually eat out every weekend. This place looked interesting and we thought we'd give it a try.   Walked in right after they opened, Saturday morning, only two other tables. We were greeted with smiling faces and attention. Allowed to choose our choice of tables.   A big chalk board with the daily specials on one wall, today strawberry yo hala. Sounded good, we tried that, I also got John Sr breakfast sandwich,  Two eggs over medium, Swiss cheese, bacon, tomatoes and mayo on eight grain toast, it was really good, bread was fresh, just the way I like it.   My husband got one of the specials, fried chicken and waffles, half a fried chicken and a Belgian waffle topped with a sweet, strawberry butter and served with our signature sweet and spicy sauce. It took 18 min to cook the fried chicken, but worth the wait. Crunchy, juicy and waffles crisp on outside and soft inside.   The stuffed strawberry yo hala was good but had too much cream cheese filling and was a bit overwhelming. Service was definitely great, the place is cute, prices are reasonable and we'll be back to try other great menu items!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Could not get pictures because I scarfed it down too fast.  Thank you Channel 8 for highlighting this place when they opened.  Did NOT disappoint.  Mike said Chicken and Waffles were so good...strawberry butter...that he is taking doggie bag home.  Unheard of at our house.  We will be back.  Again and again."}
{"text":"Chicken pot pie was very good. Wife had the soup and the only complaint is the bowl is a little on the small side."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of hype surrounding this place and while the food was good and the selections were plenty it semi lives up to it.   We ordered:   Fried Chicken & Waffle - Pretty big portion with the strawberry butter that was fire. Chicken was done well and waffles were good  Corned Beef Hash w/ Poached Eggs & Toast - Small portion compared to Fried Chicken and Waffles...was good and done well just this alone didn't fill me up that's why my fat ass ordered the,,,  Bold City Burger - Of course couldn't finish it but it was full of flavor. What's crazy is it was a lot better as a leftover cause all the flavors had time to sync in with each other.   All in all this diner is solid, Prices might be $1 or $2 a little higher than normal but it is worth at least one try for sure."}
{"text":"Our new breakfast spot since it's only ten minutes away. The food is good and the portions can feed a small village. Reasonably priced and friendly servers"}
{"text":"Great food plus great customer service... Ask for Jonathon. He provided great and friendly service. He was on it."}
{"text":"Great service, and the food is absolutely fantastic. Definitely try the chicken and waffles...it was a revelation."}
{"text":"The best chicken and waffles I've ever had in my life. Hands down to this place. The staff was really nice good service. Will come again. Was looking for a good breakfast before heading back to Cali that was off the strip and found this treasure"}
{"text":"WHERE THE LOCALS EAT!!!  Had to try this location because i had been to the one on rainbow and forgot to review it....so I took my staff here for our monthly luncheon! We had employees that helped the contractor who was building this location so we wanted to come support them. My 1st experience at the Rainbow location was good. The food was great but the atmosphere was a little less than I enjoyed. I know this is a diner but the person calling back the orders to the chefs was extremely loud and was very distracting from trying to have a conversation at my table. I ordered the burger that was made with 2 grilled cheese sandwiches and the burger in the middle. It was yummy. I have to say I am extremely picky when it comes to meat...this was good. Well seasoned. I like the lettuce slaw...mayo, lettuce and pickles...perfect idea. For me the only thing that could have made it better was if the crusts were cut off the grilled cheese sandwiches. It was a lot to try to wrap my mouth around and I was very disappointed in the mac N cheese. I thought at a diner it would have been amazing but it tasted like noodles with canned cheese on top. My man had the fried chicken plate. He said it was really good. Very tasty chicken and juicy. At the Stephanie location , although it was brand new, a lot of employees with trainers, the feeling and vibe was SO much better. The noise was just the patrons enjoying themselves not a man yelling out orders. Our waitress altough new was very pleasant and did a great job. Her trainer...omg...you guys need to promote him. I wish i remebered his name...he was from Rainbow he said and has only been with the company for 2 months. You would have thought he had been with you for 10 years. My staff all ordered something completely different.  Huevos rancheros with chocolate chip,banana pankcakes and the other was a burger with swiss,bacon and mushrooms. I ordered the pastrami sandwich on rye! As I stated i am very picky about meat so I was a little hesitant to try the pastrami and I am SOOOO glad I did. It was the best I have ever had!  I will definitely be returning to the Stephanie location!!! I will let my photos speak for themselves!"}
{"text":"Portions sizes were huge Food was amazing .. i completely forgot our severs name but she was amazing !!! Felt like she's worked there her whole life and was very attentive!!"}
{"text":"Good food and reasonable prices.  The service was OK.  Asked 3 different people for ranch dressing and never got it."}
{"text":"I stopped in today with my girlfriend. She ordered a breakfast plate with pancakes. Everything was okay except for the pancakes.  The pancakes were thick, spongy, and hard. I ordered the fish and chips and the fish was undercooked. Unfortunately, we definitely  won't be dining here again."}
{"text":"This was a super lunch experience we had, the restaurant seems orderly, clean, uniform and feels pleasant right away. We came in for lunch and had fast service with a pleasant smile, our server was kind and helpful, beautiful lady. Our lunch was true to metro diner standards, we had a monte cristo, a croissant breakfast and a texan burger, all marvellous."}
{"text":"We decided to try this new restaurant in town from which we've heard a lot about, when we arrived it was quite busy the hostess informed us that the wait would be 15 to 20 minutes, a party of 7 arrived probably 5 to 10 minutes after we did;  as we waited and waited for a long long time well over the 20 minutes they said we would wait, the party of seven was sat before us. The food was good my Philly cheese steak sandwich was okay, pretty small though.  Everyone's dinner was okay, service considering it was a service manager who took care of us was I guess friendly, nonetheless I was very upset about having to wait so long and having a party of 7 sat in front of us noting that we were a party of six. I am not sure I will come back to this place it was a very bad experience overall because there was no acknowledgement of why we waited so long, no apology or anything."}
{"text":"First time at Metro Diner, great choice of breakfasts reasonably priced. I'd certainly come back for more!"}
{"text":"Today we took a little trip here for lunch. The place was nice and clean. I thought the silverware tucked away in its own little protective sleeve was cool. Especially during flu season when you don't want viruses falling on your fork before you even get there.   Our waitress brought our menus and took our drink order. She was incredibly nice and very engaging with us. Unfortunately she had to leave as it was the end of her shift. Luckily the waitress who replaced her was just as nice. She gave me some very detailed information on the items in the menu. I decided to try the bacon, mushroom, Swiss burger. My wife had the Charleston shrimp and grits and the kids had pancakes and Mac and cheese.   The burger was ok. A little dry for my taste. I wish there was mayo or some kind of aioli sauce. The bun seemed a little stale also. The bacon was cooked perfectly, nice and crispy, just the way I like it.   The Charleston shrimp and grits were interesting. I personally don't like grits but I tried it just because my wife ordered it. This is definitely not your regular grits. There were these grits mixture patties that were fried, swimming in some kind of sauce that reminded me of cream of mushroom without the mushroom flavor. The grit patties didn't have much flavor to them considering it's infused with cheese, roasted red peppers and andouille sausage. It had the texture of mashed potatoes with a fried outer shell. Believe it or not I liked this dish better than my burger. Eating all the different components all in one bite made me go back for more and before I knew it I had eaten one the patties.   The Mac and cheese had good flavor but the noodles were over cooked.   Now it sounds like we had a bad experience with the food here but I am totally going back there again."}
{"text":"First time here and won't be the last. Love this place. Food is amazing and the service is even better. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for great unpretentious food and service."}
{"text":"The chicken salad was disgusting. My replacement order came all wrong. Waitresses and the manager piled around my table. I do not know what these good reviews are all about. The place smells like a barm. Beware!!! Don't waste your money. Service is SLOW!!!"}
{"text":"Checked out this new spot recently and I can't wait to go back!   Normally I like to try new things, but on this go around for breakfast I stuck with Eggs Benedict and while it was good EVERYONE else's food looked so much better"}
{"text":"Been in to eat twice and not overly impressed with the food. Large portions a plus. Had the fried chicken dinner on this visit. Chicken was overly salty for my taste though it was fried nice and crisp, best part of the dinner was the mixed veggies. The food was on the low side of warm upon delivery. The service is great here."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my husband. The menu has a good variety of items, I was tossed between having breakfast or dinner. I decided on the fish n chips but had the mac n cheese as my side vs the fries. It was delicious! Fish was good, had a light batter and the mac n cheese was excellent! My husband had the pastrami sandwich with mashed potatoes, big portions and it was very good! Someone next to us ordered the chicken n waffles and it looked awesome, we both said next time we need to order that :)).  The service was good, food came out pretty quickly and was hot and fresh. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going into a Metro Diner and I will for sure be back. It was very busy in there and I was very nervous we would have a long wait but they sat us right away. Our waitress Ashley H was AMAZING! She was by far the most attentive and helpful waitress I ever had. She let us know all about different menu items we had questions about and let us know all the different choices we had. Everything we got we loved and Ashley made our experience spectacular. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here. It was my first time here. I had the country fried steak which was delicious but my friend had the chicken and waffles and I tried it and if I ever get to come back here I will definitely order this. I'm from out of town. When we arrived which was around 7:30 late greeted us very friendly and our server Kahli was super fun and friendly, and wonderfully attentive. Everyone there including the manager was so friendly and accommodating and did not fuss because we were still there after close, which we didn't attend to be, we thought they close at 9, but that is on the weekends. All around great atmosphere. If I lived here it would be a regular for me."}
{"text":"Oh my god I've never ever in my life had chicken this delicious I don't now they should be a chicken place this chicken is out of this world it will put KFC out of business no more churches chicken no more Popeyes this chicken from Metro diner it's like crack your find yourself going back every day you're in Vegas"}
{"text":"Second time for charm, much better experience from the first visit.  Went to breakfast this morning, and clearly not as busy as the first time.  Flying solo, sat at the counter, which brings back memories of diners up north-comfort and home.  The food was good and the service also much better.  Loved talking with the chef. Went safe with a ham and cheese omelette, which came with hash browns and I also went with a biscuit. Everything was good, and the biscuit was huge!  I will come back and give their Eggs Benedict a try.  Arrived at 9, seated by the kitchen, seems like we were forgotten.  Had to look for someone to serve us, been here a half hour, have coffee, but no food yet.  After 20 minutes, finally got food, no one has come around to ask about our meal, no refill on coffee.  I ordered the Corn beef hash -- cooked on flat top, was crunchy.  I wouldn't order again.  My friend had the breakfast sandwich, which was cold, probably because it took 20 minutes to get food.  First time here,  not sure if I would come back. It's like our table was forgotten.  It want that busy, so service should have been better,  and food, nothing to write home about--very disappointed.  The manager, Keith, was very apologetic and does seem to care, and our waitress Sha was good--she was doing damage control.  We provided our feedback--let's see."}
{"text":"All around a nice place but beware.  This place only gets 2 stars.  I went with my uncle for breakfast.  We both ordered western omelettes and requested they make them frittata style where they beat the items into the eggs rather than fold the omelette with the items sitting in the middle.  So when the bill comes I see a $1.00 frittata charge for each omelette.  I questioned the waitress and she claims she didn't even know that it cost extra which I believe because she didn't mention it when we ordered it that way.  Now mind you, we didn't request extra ingredients.  All it takes is to beat the items into the eggs.  Why would that cost an additional 1.00 per omelette?  It doesn't make sense.  I have yet to go back and I'm not sure I will.  I don't like nickel & dime-ing and this really upset me especially since their pricing is already on the high side."}
{"text":"My family and i have been here a few times and love it here! We even bring friends there when they visit us! Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"My Spot BUT if you get Bradley as a server, ask for someone else!!! I've had him twice & each time he was a DB! No personality, no \"you're welcome\" after multiple \"thank you\" just not personable. He came to my table to take my order and to bring the check, however, I saw him at other tables multiple times. The food is usually stellar, but today I received a plate full of grease. I ate here often when I lived in Jacksonville, and multiple times here in Charlotte, and I will say today is definitely a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Definitely my new go-to breakfast spot! I had the French Toast special and it came with two eggs, toast, hash browns and at least four pieces of bacon in addition to the two cinnamon French toast slices. And the syrup came to the table warmed! I'm so full right now but already can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Today was the first time I've visited Metro Diner. I had a taste for chicken and waffles, so I did a quick search to find a place that would serve it at dinnertime and came across this place. I was very pleased with my experience here! I didn't think to take a picture of my plate before I started eating, but I was very satisfied with what I received. I was a little hesitant about the sweet and spicy syrup and strawberry butter combination that they served with the waffles, but I was pleasantly surprised. The helping of chicken is huge: a breast, a wing, a thigh, and a leg. I ended up taking three of the pieces home because I got pretty full off of the waffle alone. The service was very friendly and pretty fast considering how busy they were. I'll definitely visit again in the near future!"}
{"text":"Everything was awesome !! The food , the service, and the coffee. I had the steak and eggs and both were cooked to perfection. And I must say that the grits were some of the best I have had. I love the portion sizes , you for sure wont leave hungry. Great job all around. The place is also very wheelchair friendly. Wished I lived close by. We will  be back next year for another Panthers game and will definitely be back"}
{"text":"They are known for their FRIED CHICKEN & WAFFLES.  For $15, you get half of a chicken (drumstick, wing, thigh & breast) with 4 pieces of their popular Belgian Waffles.  We decided to just get a side order of their chicken since we wanted to get other breakfast items. My friend and I decided to just get 1 drumstick each.  - They charged us $7 for the 2 small drumsticks. - Holy crap, it was near inedible as it was a complete salt bomb.  - My friend commented that they've been really inconsistent with their fried chicken lately.  1st time: It was \"delicious, the best fried chicken I've ever had.\"  2nd time he had it, he said it was \"super bland\", so bland that he had to add salt to it himself.  3rd time/yesterday: We damn near got high blood pressure. All you could taste was the salt.  BREAKFAST CROISSANT ($7):  You can't go wrong with eggs, bacon and cheese. Very generous with the eggs and cheese, it was basically spilling over. What I didn't like was getting only 2 dinky slices of bacon.   CRAB CAKE BENEDICT ($14): Best dish of the day. The two crab cakes were meaty and tasted delicious, the hash brown was crispy and lightly seasoned.   It took over 25 mins for us to get our food. The kitchen just couldn't keep up, you could see the servers all standing around by the window waiting to pick up their food. Our server was great in coming by frequently to update us on our orders, so an extra star for him and his friendly professional attitude. Metro Diner is lucky to have him."}
{"text":"We Yelp'd to find breakfast after finding out the place we wanted to try closed down. SO GREATFUL FOR YELP!!!! What a fantastic eatery. We got Yo Hala On The Square(stuffed French toast) & Huevos Rancheros. My kiddo LOVED her stuffed French toast and the Huevos Rancheros featured CRIPSY tortillas! Seriously, nachos for breakfast?!? Sign me up! We will be back to try their chicken & waffles, biscuits & gravy & more!"}
{"text":"I hate to write this review, but what a disappointment.  I have been to the original Metro Diner in Jacksonville and this doesn't even come close.  I have just spent 1.5 hours there and an hour of it was waiting... 20 min to be seated, no problem, but 40 min for food??? It was so frustrating and the food was just average.  I like Peter (elite), I ordered the corned beef Hash with poached eggs and was not impressed, not to mention it wasn't even hot.  My husband got the nutty waffle and was ok with it.  The service was good and friendly; she did apologize for the wait but offered no explanation of the hold up.  I am not inclined to return as I can get similar quality within 30 min."}
{"text":"Brought my kids here for breakfast. The staff was so friendly and kind, the food was so delicious, tasted like home! It's across the street from our house, but I would come back anyway. It was a great experience and was affordable."}
{"text":"This place has the best reuben sandwich I have ever eaten!  Meals are hot, saucy, and sloppy.  We loved it.  Husband had the Holy Davoli which is a burger + grilled cheese hybrid.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"A great little restaurant/diner in charlotte. You get way more than what you pay for. I ordered the chicken and waffle meal. I also ordered a flavored sweet tea... But I'm going to pretend that that didn't even happen because of how underwhelming it was. But the chicken and waffle was one of the best that I've had. The chicken was seasoned pretty well and the portion given was pretty large. I'm pretty sure I got one leg, one thigh, one wing, and one breast. The best part about the whole entire meal was the strawberry butter for the waffle. It both looks and taste just like strawberry ice cream. If I could just order a jar of that for home, I definitely would. I am not so much of a fan of their \"spicy syrup\"... It is pretty much just syrup mixed with Texas Pete. But overall this was a very good meal... And it's not that expensive. Also their food can be delivered via DoorDash."}
{"text":"Great diner! Food is yummy. We went on a Saturday morning and it was quick service. The waitress was nice and friendly. The biscuits and gravy, egg baked pie, and strawberry cheesecake waffles were all great!"}
{"text":"Price is good for a big meal. I cant finish actually all of them and needed to share it with other person. They served pure american ala carte and the atmosphere is like back in the 90's."}
{"text":"Food and staff was excellent as was the food.  Worth a trip off the Strip for tourists."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Metro Diner and I ordered the Jumbo chicken pot pie. It was delicious. I cannot remember exactly but it included a different bean in it but it still tasted great.   The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 is due to the long wait time. The staff uses iPads to take orders but it took more than 30 minutes for all of our food to be ready for a four-person table.  I have been part of a family that have run multiple restaurants and I understand it can become hectic but this cannot be an excuse when you are a diner."}
{"text":"It was sooooo good! My husband and I shared the chicken and waffles,shrimp and grits and the pound cake French toast..OOMMMGG! I can't complain about anything. From the customer service to the PERFECTLY FRIED and SEASONED fried chicken...We definitely weren't disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok, since we lost our diner in Cornelius I was glad to see another. We enjoyed everything we ate. The only odd thing was someone, the manager maybe ? He came over and told us that the chicken pot pie my husband ordered was not up to their standard but we should enjoy it and he would bring another. The we can either eat it or take it home. Now had he not said that , we would have enjoyed it and not known any better, but since he did and no other chicken pot pie came  that was supposedly up to their standards, we felt  odd. Like did we just eat something that was not good. Plus I also think they brought him a small and not the large he ordered and paid for , but he did not need the larger portion anyway in my opinion. I just thought how odd to have such good customer service to come and say something like that and then then drop the ball. I even stopped by the front and said goodbye to him to see if it clicked and nothing. It just made me laugh all day that I was told what I am eating is not up to snuff but here you go enjoy.  Other than that I thought the food was good. Loved the BLT but next time I would take out the extra piece of bread if that is an option"}
{"text":"First time here.  Ordered their special, which was the stuffing waffle with mashed potatoes, turkey, gravy, and cranberry sauce.  The good: the portion was huge!  I took more than half of it home.  The stuffing waffle was moist on the inside, firm on the outside.  The potatoes were very good. The meh: My turkey had a lingering aroma of being frozen just a hair too long, and on the verge of freezer burn.  It's a taste I can detect easily.  It wasn't bad, but it was there.  I'm not a \"send it back for any little thing\" like some people, and it not something that detracted heavily from the meal.   The gravy was a tad salty for my taste, though I suspect it's just out of the jar. For the price of $11.99, I think it is a good multiple serving meal.  It's very heavy food, but I enjoyed it.  I will be back."}
{"text":"The chicken was burnt had French fries with brown gravy that had no taste sweet raspberry tea that you couldn't tell was raspberry"}
{"text":"Horrible food. Had the huevos rancheros and it made me sick to my stomach all day. For the rest of the day I didn't have an appetite. I eat everything and food never bothers my stomach so lord knows what was In there. Will not be back again."}
{"text":"Holly Shit!!!!  the Chicken and Waffles !!!! Best I have ever had! Chicken was not dry and very tender!!"}
{"text":"Open a location in NW Vegas!! If we are in Henderson we try to make a point of hitting up Metro Diner.  Lots of great food...good portions and reasonable prices.  They also have fancy daily specials."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles are AMAZING! Everything we had was excellent and the prices were very reasonable. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Our new fav... just opened 10mos ago here in Vegas. We loved this diner when we first discover it in Jacksonville FL. We need one in San Francisco. Great customer service and food."}
{"text":"My mom had heard about this new diner and wanted to check it out so we had dinner here recently.  Its a very homey restaurant with great staff and the food is great.  Lots of down home items but some interesting stuff too.  I had the chicken pot pie.  It was huge.  Lots of crust filled with chicken, veggies and gravy.  It was too big to eat the whole thing.  My mom had the grilled cheese sandwich with bacon added and it came with fries.  The fries were really good - crispy on the outside, soft of the inside.  She said it was good sandwich.  Our service was great.  The waitress was helpful and refilled drinks often.  We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"First time at this diner.  Welcomed by friendly employees, seated quickly, we requested a table for 5 including 2 small children. Table space well done with outside patio tables. Several daily specials offered, however we dined on fried grits smothering white gravy with a generous helping of shrimp. Delicious! Generous portions, made to order. I was only able to eat, half, so I brought the rest home. Staff attentive but not smothering, coffee hot and good. Great way to start the day.  Go try this Diner as it is offers true diner food plus more!"}
{"text":"My 2nd visit and so far everything has been great, friendly and fast service, good prices, all around a awesome breakfast place.  I would definitely recommend our locals and to our Las Vegas Visitors.  Since I usually come here on the weekdays, it's always been fast seating and fast service. People, there is more out there than Denny's, IHOP and any other chain coffee shops. Try this place I don't think it will disappoint!"}
{"text":"I have been to the location on Tropicana, and absolutely loved it there, but after moving from the area, we didn't really get the chance to visit anymore. The other night, we decided we wanted to return, and realized with a start that the other location had moved! We let our heart rates return to normal after realizing they had simply moved rather than shut down, and decided to pay the new location a visit. We were absolutely not disappointed, as everything was just as great as I remembered. Our server was John, and from the beginning he was funny, personable, and attentive. I would return just because of him, even if the food hadn't been top notch, (which it was, no worries there). I can't wait for payday so we can visit again!"}
{"text":"This is my third trip to Metro Diner, and each time is better than the last, which is saying something because the first trip was pretty incredible. Everything I have tried on the menu so far has been beyond my expectations, but what really keeps us coming back is the wait staff. They are all kind and extremely personable. We had Finn helping us out this last trip, and she was fun, attentive, and made our visit more enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this place to any and every one, especially if Finn is there!"}
{"text":"Had to try this place out. They just opened so there was a few kinks but their service was still great. The food was yummy. In a month this place will be booming!   Good job guys! Thanks for the great service Patrick."}
{"text":"I tried this place for breakfast. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day. Service was great and fast. I ordered the chicken and waffles which was really good. My jaw dropped at how much fried chicken you get. The waffle was soft & thick, yet crispy on the outside. Beware that the shrimp & grits aren't your traditional southern style. It look more like a brick with gravy. The grits were a fried block of some sort, sitting in what looked like gravy. I would probably pass on this, as it doesn't even look appetizing. The manager was great to allow us to order something else. Not everything is for everybody."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars due to the excellent customer service. The food that I had ordered was decent. I ordered the San Francisco Benedict which was very tasty other than the hash browns being absolutely bland. The English muffin part of the eggs Benedict was tough to cut where it didn't show any mercy to my steak knife. Pancakes were again, decent. The taste/consistency reminded me of the pre-made pancake mix, Krusteaz. The best part about this place was the customer service. From the hostess to server to manager, we felt very welcomed."}
{"text":"If you ask your friend what do you wanna eat and they say \"I don't know\" just bring them here! Metro Diner is great the servers are very friendly and the food is great, you will not be disappointed. I've been here a couple of times and I can definitely say it's worth it. They've got flavored teas and the flavor changes every now and then. They also have a soup of the day but I've only seen it change twice hahaha but both the broccoli cheddar and the clam chowder were great. The meatloaf plate is awesome, I wish the chicken pot pie was a little more savory, it is a little bland in my opinion however still good. They recently added a Cajun chicken pasta and that has been my go to for a while! Metro Diner is great and I will keep going."}
{"text":"Wow. Great food, sweet southern service, and monster portions. This place has my vote!"}
{"text":"Service 5 stars!   Food was \"just ok\" my son got kids grilled cheese and the cheese was not melted, I got eggs Benny and it was very bland (as where the home fries) and after leaving I realized there was not tomatoes on it which menu said there was."}
{"text":"Had another wonderful meal today. Nichole was our waitress and was exceptional!  I typically order the same thing (breakfast) but stepped out of my comfort zone and ordered the BLT with the freshly made potato chips... mmmmm! So glad she recommended them. If you haven't tried this place, you're missing out. Great food, friendly service and good prices."}
{"text":"Love at first bite try everything  all great Mac and cheese is to please  service is great and the chefs  are all  A plus"}
{"text":"Best CHICKEN EVER! The chicken and waffles is amazingggggg. The chicken biscuits also really good. The waffles and strawberry butter tastes like cotton candy. The hash browns loaded are also somewhat of great!"}
{"text":"All American Diner at its finest!  Located centrally on the southeast side of the town with many other places to shop and eat around. Parking is not an issue as there are plenty enough. First time dining here and already i felt as if i had dined here before. It really gives you that homey style diner vibe. Walking right in you can tell that this place works really fast and really hard. We got seated fairly quickly, but i can imagine long wait times during the peak hours and with big party. There are booth style tables and regular square tables that can seat 4 people comfortably. The waitress i had was very nice and explained all we needed to know about the place and also recommended to us what was a crowd favorite. She also noted that the portions come fairly large so order accordingly which i think is always a great tip! One of the beast meatloaf i ever had here in vegas !! the chicken and waffles was alright. Comparing it to other chicken and waffles around the valley. Was not disappointed at all. Will definitely come back !!  They offer Military Discount! - Awesome !! and Thank You !!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food! Highly recommend. We ordered the chicken and waffles (heavenly) and burger."}
{"text":"Lived up to my expectations.  Good diner food, great service, and a menu full of diner classics.  I have been here twice now and both times were enjoyable.     First time I had the meat loaf, mashed potatoes and grilled veggies.   The meat loaf was on point with proper seasoning and good texture.   It was covered in a brown gravy that was a perfect compliment. The mashed potatoes were creamy and real.    My second trip I ordered the fried chicken platter. 4 pieces of chicken, mashed potatoes with gravy, veggies and a biscuit.  It was a huge amount of tasty food.  Ended up taking a couple of pieces of chicken home.  The wife ordered the chicken pot pie.  IT WAS FREAKING HUGE!  It was full of goodness and she enjoyed a good chunk of it before she was full.     I will darken the door of Metro Diner again!"}
{"text":"I moved here from Jacksonville Fl this past July and was beyond excited when I saw them building a Metro Diner not far from my house. This is a Jax staple and one of my favorite brunch spots. Finally able to try it this morning and even my grumpy, brunch hating husband really enjoyed the food. So glad you guys are here!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Metro Diner for the first time this morning for breakfast. It was a great experience all the way around -- fast and friendly service, good food with generous portions and some delicious diner coffee. The exterior of the restaurant doesn't look very appealing -- an odd location next to the Autozone and not great signage -- but the inside is very clean, welcoming and much bigger than it looks like from the outside."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch and the service was super even though we were there on the 4th day they were open.  Had the Eggs Benedict and the eggs were PERFECTLY poached, which is not easy to find. My husband had the Manhattan Clam Chowder and a 1/2 sandwich which was also good.  We will be regulars."}
{"text":"I love a good New York diner! So, when I heard about Metro Diner, I bookmarked it.   I arrived around 11:30, just beating the lunch crowd. I ordered a cup of broccoli cheese soup, the soup of the day, and a club sandwich with fries. The Soup was filling with a lot of broccoli and cheese, served with crackers.  As for the club, they know what a club should be. The quantity of ham, turkey, bacon and cheese was balanced to perfection with lettuce and toasted bread.   Service was on point, however, I did feel a little rushed as they seem to want to push people in and out, which I get, turn tables. However, definitely don't like feeling rushed while enjoying any meal. I look forward to checking out they brunch items."}
{"text":"After a great experience at the Pineville location I was looking forward to this location, and a great breakfast. Unfortunately my expectations weren't met. I arrived on a Tuesday morning, just shy of lunch so decided to order breakfast...it had been long morning dealing with the auto repair shop and rental car company, ugh. So, enough about that, back to Metro.  I ordered the Western Omelette with an English Muffin and Hash Brown and I added a side of Sausage Links. The Omelette was good, but nothing great. I wish the cheese was more combined and melted. As for the sausage links, ugh. Not my favorite. My English Muffin was not toasted, which I did send back. Overall, it was a nice breakfast, but nothing great. I did love their coffee and the staff. Like the other location, service is outstanding. For now I'll probably stick with their Pineville-Matthews location."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best in Henderson. NV. The food was beyond delicious but you must take someone to share it with because the portions are ginormus. Lol you will not find better service in l as Vegas. The place was packed but now I understand why. We loved it!!! It will be our new must go to place... Thank you Metro Diner.."}
{"text":"We came here twice because we really enjoyed it the first day , there's tons of restaurants in Vegas but this one is highly recommend and now we knew why. My wife and I stayed at the Mandalay for a week and we try to eat at a different restaurant for breakfast,  lunch, and dinner but we really liked this one alot so we came in twice, very attentive and the food is soooo flood, Breakfast is when we were coming. Evrything is super clean and new. Seems like the owner is everyone because everybody is awesome. I wish San Diego had a place like this."}
{"text":"Welp Yelp, you are right again.   I've been wanting to dine here for a long time just based on my fianc√©'s recent experiences not to mention the glowing reviews Metro Diner has.   A party of 6 1/2 of us dined here for Sunday brunch at 11:00am.  We showed up about 20 minutes early so we could snag a table since I assumed it would be crowded.  There wasn't a long wait at all and our hostess sat us within 10 minutes.  First off, the customer service here is some of the friendliest around.  We were checked on multiple times by different staff members.  Metro has a few signature items such as the Fried Chicken and Waffles and the Shrimp and Grits.  However, for my first visit here I chose the Chicken Pot Pie and, boy, was that a fabulous choice for me!  The crust is flakey and the filling is tasty.  It's a very generous portion, too, and since that first visit I've had it at the other Metro Diner on Rainbow because I'm such a fan. There are lots of choices on the menu so give this diner a try for good food and very friendly service."}
{"text":"Wasn't going back after a over priced greasy breakfast  , but they sent me a $10 dollar coupon so I went back for a second try and same thing greasy and over salted hash browns.  Never again! To many other choices in area."}
{"text":"Amazing.   Chicken and waffles     I would eat here three times a day.    I like the diner seating too.   Perfect!"}
{"text":"So happy they're putting multiple locations in Henderson. The staff here was very friendly and the food was great. I ordered the chocolate chip waffle and it was big enough for two people! Go here if you are looking for a cute new breakfast place to try!"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffle all the way! The hot sauce and maple syrup was phenomenal with it! Service was great as well."}
{"text":"Metro Diner makes dining out feel as though your still at home! We've had nothing short of fantastic service every single time we arrive. Nichole has made our stay here so welcoming and we could not have asked for better food and service from this wonderful staff. Love the energy!"}
{"text":"If you want an all day breakfast, this is the place to come! We ordered the shrimp and grits...yum!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place hits a home run. Service, food, price. All great. We couldn't have been happier. Servings are huge. Well done. We will see you again. Thank you for a great meal."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my family while visiting and everything was delish! Good sized portions and great flavor. I ordered their SF eggs benedict and my hubby ordered their philly.  This is SUPER nitpicky now, but my eggs were poached too long because I didn't get the satisfaction of being able to pop the yolk over my dish and the philly, personally, needed a slice or two more cheese so you can have that gooey-ness with every bite...BUT despite those hiccups, it didn't bother us because the food was STILL super flavorful and tastey! Wouldn't mind coming here again."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Nice staff. I ordered a half order of the chicken and waffles and it was the perfect size and delicious.   I gave only 4 stars because our server never returned with the syrup he offered us. I guess there was a spicy maple syrup that was available.  He talked it up, got us all excited about it, and then never brought it.   Coffee is overpriced - but everything else - great. Would go again if it weren't so crowded!!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about the service we had here!  I came with a group of 10 friends and even though I had received incorrect information about reservations earlier in the week, Lamont, the manager and his staff took amazing care of our group.  The food and service were wonderful.  We will definitely be back!!  Thanks again for the great morning!"}
{"text":"Metro diner was amazing. This was my first time here with my wife and the service and food was great. I ordered the \"Bold City Burger\" which was so good and my wife ordered the chicken and waffles which looked fantastic. The chicken and waffles came with a strawberry butter which she said taste so good and it came with a good amount of chicken. The service is really fast, we didn't wait no longer than 15 minutes. I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about, at least for dinner. Ordered the fish n' chips...they ran out of fish. Ordered the avocado toast....for $8.00, got avocado that was browning already. The salad with chicken was a monstrosity. Veggies of a rather low quality overall. Classic burger was pedestrian. In short, there doesn't seem to be anything to distinguish this diner from any other in Vegas and it's no better (possibly worse) than a Denny's. Would try again for breakfast...maybe."}
{"text":"Was at nearby Green Valley Ranch when decided to look for near by diners.  Found out about Metro Diner figured give it a try.  From them moment I opened the door and the smell hit me I was happy.  Smelled so yummy.  The service was very nice friendly and knew their menu well.  Asked several questions and answers given right away.  Hate asking questions and getting the old I don't know I will find out.  The burger was soooo good...   Half pound of Angus beef burger topped with lettuce slaw (shredded lettuce, chopped pickle and mayo) in between two grilled cheese sandwiches stuffed with American cheese, ripe tomatoes and our own cherrywood smoked bacon.  Sooo yummy.  Try this place you will love it. I will be going back for sure..."}
{"text":"I have been here several times with a friend and we both agree the place is great. He likes that he can have breakfast anytime and the breakfast menu is great. Try the breakfast pie. So good. Service is always fast and super friendly. Overall a great place to eat."}
{"text":"I stopped by after dropping my kids to school and i was very pleasantly surprised.  Great Service. Fresh Hot food. Amazing taste! Highly Recommended"}
{"text":"When you have a combination of great food and great service it becomes a magnificent duo. Our server Javier was almost as amazing as the chicken and waffles lol.. no, really Javier was the best! Definitely coming back again soon.."}
{"text":"From the second we stepped into Metro Diner, an amazing experience began. The place had to be at capacity but the staff was still some of the happiest I have ever seen. After a 5 minute wait (super impressive considering the amount pf people in there) we were seated and our server, Dario. He immediately asked us how our day was and then gave us a rundown of the daily specials and other notable notable items on the menu. We walked in hungry but after he gave his salivating descriptions, we were starving. Everything, literally everything sounded so good! We ended up going with the 3 egg breakfast and the chicken and waffles, which Dario mentioned was one of the best things on the menu.  Before the food came out, Dario presented me with a dipping sauce that is their own kind of special sauce. It was a mix of maple syrup and Louisiana hot sauce. Despite my insistence that it was not going to be a good mix, he told me to give it a try. When the food came out i was in awe. We paid about $25 for all of the food and got TONS OF FOOD. Ive never seen a better deal! On top of that the food tasted amazing! The chicken, which Dario told us was marinated for 48 hours, was amazing and tasted even better with the syrup/hot sauce concoction. The waffles were topped with a sort of strawberry butter that had small pieces of diced strawberries in it. Again I was blown away by the flavor. The 3 egg breakfast looked like it had at least 4 eggs in it and included toast, hash browns, AND sausage patties. Most places only give you one or the other but this was all of the above for the same price. Impressive. Last but not least. The decor and vibe of this place was awesome. It has an open kitchen with a bar you can sit at and does a good job being crowded, while also feeling spacious. If you are a local, I definitely recommend you try this place over alternatives such as Cracked Egg or Egg Works. I like those places but Metro Diner is KILLING them in every category. Will see you again soon Dario and Metro Diner. You guys are the best!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! I went for brunch and had the sampler breakfast (I believe it's called the Bissell breakfast). It included the fluffiest pancakes - ever! The manager on duty was great. He gave suggestions and made sure we had everything we needed once seated. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, once for breakfast and twice for lunch. On each occasion they are pretty packed. The service is decent, however the waiters and waitresses seem very rushed and somewhat un attentive to their customers needs. During breakfast, we waited for an extended amount of time for our drinks.. having to ask multiple times for our hot tea and encountered wrong food orders being brought to our table and missing items. The second attempt for lunch was much better. Today we also dined in for lunch. I ordered the chicken salad, which was flavored decently, however I encountered a grisly piece which ended that meal. My husband and daughter both ordered chicken fingers which came over cooked and were hard. The service again was decent, drink refills were brought by without being prompted, it still felt as though our waitress was rushed, perhaps too many tables?! I'm not really impressed with this particular location or the menu selections, but when in the area I may visit again."}
{"text":"Not exactly the place you would come to get a fruit salad but other wise great little spot :)"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times already.  You can tell these people have been in business a while.  They have their act together.    The food & service have been very good.  I have gotten their chicken salad on a sandwich & also on a salad.    I will be back again."}
{"text":"Delicious food paired with efficient service this place is a win-win in my book! The menu offers a variety of options and specials every day. The restaurant is cozy and all staff was friendly and helpful. The veggie omelet (egg whites), english muffin and  home fries were great- definitely recommend! Love that they include asparagus in their veggie omelet!!! The others in my party enjoyed the spinach salad and the grilled cheese with tomato and bacon. Good portions, fresh food! Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Metro diner for so yummy grub. As always since they've opened been Amazing! The costumer service is excellent, The FOOD is Delicious  very home style and the portions are huge. I will continue the recommend this as it's one of my go to spots ."}
{"text":"Portions are huge, and the food is amazing.  It will be hard to choose what to eat - so bring a friend to share something with!  The Croissant French Toast is out of this world, it's moist, crisp, delicate, and buttery all at once!  The problem is you'll have to choose between that and the Chicken and Waffles, which come with a Strawberry Whipped butter.  I literally ate the strawberry butter like ice cream - my heart doesn't feel good, but my taste buds said it was worth it!    The only issue with the Chicken and Waffles is that you have to make a decision on what to dip your chicken in: the strawberry butter?  Some syrup with a little waffle?  Or do you use the house made BBQ sauce, that is smoky and spicy with a great flavor?    Not there for breakfast or want more of a lunch or dinner option?  You have to consider the Huevos Rancheros - large chips with beans, salsa, cheese, your choice of eggs, and my favorite - FRIED JALAPENOS!  They are soooooo tasty to pick off and eat.    Think you can handle any dish?  Then order the Holy Davoli Burger.  The patty is well sized, cooked to pink in the middle burger and then placed between a pair of grilled cheese sandwiches with some pickle slaw...it's more than a mouthful to bite!  And yes, I said a PAIR of grilled cheese sandwiches!  One with tomatoes, the other with bacon!  I have already sent a few friend over to you - who are asking what to try - and I don't have a single answer for them, just to try it all!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service! We were greeted coming in, during lunch, and leaving! Everyone made sure we were happy and everything was well. The food was amazing and lunch times were busy. Was really happy they have raspberry tea and the fish and chips were DELISH! We will def be back!"}
{"text":"Monte Cristo is awesome, tea is just right, service was excellent and pasta salad very tasty. Very busy and nice atmosphere make this a great stop."}
{"text":"I have food sensitivities and I can eat here! Makes me very happy. Lovely staff. Good people.   Also, I invite clients to the diner for meetings over an hour long (I asked if it was cool first) and they literally accommodate you. It's my second office now.   And the prices!!! Who knew you could get a meal for two people under $20 in this town. :)"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and the wait staff is awesome. Do yourself a favor and make sure you get your hash browns with bacon, mushrooms, cheese and onions you will t regret it I assure you. The crab Benedict was to die for."}
{"text":"Just wow! My husband took me here for my birthday. We've never been here and it is by far the best breakfast we've ever had. We went on a Saturday morning and Javier was our server. He was so attentive and worked so hard to make sure everyone was well taken care of. It was pretty busy when we went but well worth the wait. I would highly recommended this place"}
{"text":"I really was hoping this restaurant would live up to the all the hype. I had the Pastrami sandwich on Rye with a side of fries. The sandwich was ok, nothing special, portions were generous. Asked for crispy fries but got fries that were not very crispy, kind of a let down that they can't get fries done right.   Had the Peach Cobbler with a scoop of ice cream for dessert. The cobbler was not warm enough to melt the ice cream. I wont be back......  They need to work on their cooking quality control.  The server was excellent, too bad that the food wasn't. Overall a let down."}
{"text":"Our first time, and glad we did!  Our server was Chelsea.  Very polite, professional and happy --- I think she likes working here!  Chelsea was very helpful when we said it was our first time, explained quite a few menu items and specials.  We ordered the pot roast meal and the Reuben sandwich.  Since we eat lunch out every day, we may be hard to impress.  BUT the pot roast was spectacular!  And the Reuben was every bit as good as the best I have ever had before.  Their coleslaw is perfectly balanced, not too sweet, not too much mayo, just perfect.  I love coleslaw and haven't liked any this much in a long time.  Guess we now have a new place to add to the rotation!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Metro diner after reading the reviews I was very excited to try it. I went to the Rainbow and Warm Springs location in Las Vegas. The hostess was friendly the waitress was fine I noticed that the floors are extremely slippery I don't know if it's what they're using to clean the floor, something on the mop, or just the floor itself. After I placed my order I was on yelp reading the rest of the reviews. I came across one review that commented that there waitress left the check on the table while they were still eating. About two minutes after the food made it to the table our waitress came by and put the check on the table and said that we could add dessert to it or just keep it the way it is. Our waitresses name was Darla G. Otherwise she was very knowledgeable on the menu items and how they are made and had new drinks on our table the minute we needed them without even having to be asked. So the reason for four stars instead of five is the check on the table cause I think it's a little bit rude. Makes me think of the back of my head that she's never going to come back and check on us. Lol"}
{"text":"A busy place, but they bus the tables promptly and have excellent service, so the wait times are short.  Staff is very friendly.  I have been here several times and ordered several of the hamburgers.  They have all been excellent.  Prices on the various burgers vary from $9.99 to $12.99 and this is the general range for most of the breakfast lunch and dinner entrees (breakfast served any time).  The burgers are a half pound  and they are GOOD QUALITY MEAT.  They are not greasy messes (which causes the buns to become soggy).  They come with a wide assortment of sides from fries to mac and cheese to fresh fruit and several other items.  This is a far better burger than some of the big name burger joints on the strip that are twice as expensive.  Haven't tried breakfast yet, but I look forward to it!  Clean, friendly, excellent food, fast service, that's 5 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"Metro Diner is the sort of place I've been looking for for a long while. When you don't want to go all the way into Uptown for Midnight, I can head here to Metro and be just as pleased with the food.  I stopped in Sunday morning before the after-church rush started and had a comfy seat at the counter. Facing into the kitchen, I was able to watch the food being prepared, see how clean and organized it is, and watch the meals be finalized before being brought out to diners. Interesting!  I stuck with simple stuff, the corned beef hash and poached eggs. They were *perfectly* poached and the hash was much more beef than potatoes. A nice large portion! Toast was done nicely and my meal was excellent. Great service, too.  I'll be looking forward to my return to Metro."}
{"text":"Have been here several times since opening and the food each time has been great.  Staff has been good as well. Slight waits each time, but that's true of any decent spot in Matthews."}
{"text":"My first visit did not happen as the restaurant doors were closed at 9:50 PM.?  Along with a couple others, we headed to the restaurant next door.  However, several weeks later, I happened to take another shot and it was successful.  In fact, I arrived shortly before the after-work crowd began gathering in the waiting area.  Great timing on my part.  I opted for breakfast and it was simple, two eggs, bacon, toast, and grits (or hash browns?).  This was all that I needed for a cold winter night.  Service was great.  The food was great.  Be sure to check for daily specials.  They serve wine, beer, mimosas, and bloody marys and the prices are less than expected.  The only thing you need to worry about is timing.  If you are ready to eat, plan to arrive before or after the crowd.  The restaurant doesn't hold too many at once.  They have a nice bar where you can enjoy watching the food prep while you eat."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch since it's by my job and I couldn't stop thinking about coming back after a great Yelp Event here. Lunch was crazy packed so we just ordered to go. I tried a lot of food which was all great so decided to go for something new. I ordered the 3 cheese grilled cheese with a cup of tomato bisque soup, perfect for the cold weather. My coworker ordered the Cajun chicken pasta. My sandwich came with a tomato on it (which I dislike reg raw tomatoes) but it was easy to take off so I didn't complain. The hostess did see my face and me take it off and offered to just have them make me a new one because it's so fast to make but I assisted I was fine but thanked her. That was very nice and observant of her. The soup was a little too thick for my liking but the favor was really good. The pasta was hot and the cajun seasoning was just right."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the first time. I was waiting for my car at firestone. I was seated immediately. Breakfast came out fast. My eyes were bigger than my stomach. But everything was good. Hash browns were the best I'd ever had. Perfectly crispy. Good service too. Will be back."}
{"text":"This place is PACKED!!! And that says something. That says this is the diner to eat at. The service here is excellent. There isn't a long wait, and when they do see you they take your order right away. Not once did I have to ask them for a refill. And that's a big thing for me! My coffee never went empty. The waiter came over often to check on us, he even came over as my friend was talking. One of my friends likes to talk with huge gestures and it looked like he was waving his hand. I appreciate the waiter coming over to check on us even though we didn't ask for him to come over LOL. But that just shows they are always keeping an eye on their tables.    The Excellence doesn't stop at the service. The food is just as delicious as you would expect. It's no wonder this place is packed. My friend had the pound cake French toast and I had a breakfast pie. The breakfast pie was absolutely amazing, it came with a side of hash browns. They serve so much food I was unable to finish my meal, I left full.  I would definitely recommend this place for breakfast. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"This place is a little on the pricey side, but the food and service are good. It has a nice feel inside and the staff is friendly. The hostess said hello and asked how many when we walked in, and then she walked away. We didn't really know if we were supposed to follow her or if she needed to see if something was available. We decided to follow (at a distance since we weren't sure) and that turned out to be the right decision. Overall this is a nice diner with good food options."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  friendly staff. Our waitress was great. I had chicken and waffles, which my 10 month old enjoyed as well. Batter on the chicken was a little salty for my taste, but the chicken was moist and freshly cooked. Waffle was soft and fluffy, and it comes with strawberry butter. Sophie had shrimp and grits. She thought the grits could've been thicker and a little more kick to the dish,  but otherwise good flavor. Can't wait to bring the 7 yr old, bc he loves chicken.  Looking forward to trying other dishes here."}
{"text":"Brunch. Let's talk about it. Lets talk about Metro diner.   I pull right up to the front of the building. I say building, but it's really the edge of one of the buildings in the Matthews festival shopping center. The one opposite the Harris teeter.  I digress.   There are a few families milling about outside of the entrance. Judging by the jam packed outdoor seating area, they must be waiting for tables. Any place that has a wait at 10:15 on a Sunday , let's just say that's a good sign. However I also don't see a single person in the outside seating area or among the about millers that looks like me.   Some of my people abide by the rule that if you don't see us at a restaurant, then the  restaurant must not be all that good. I don't agree with that per se, but I distinctly remember thinking, \"hmm. I might be the lone brother in here.\" I took a moment to prep myself for that possibility.   My worries were immediately abated when, upon entry, I was greeted by 2 bright eyed young ladies, one of whom looked like me, and was invited to seat myself at the bar next to another lady who looked like me.  If you've never eaten at the bar in a diner, what is your life? There are few More interesting and enjoyable foodie experiences than watching 15 people operate a short order kitchen during a heavy food time. You've got 8-10 short order cooks, limbs and pans flying away. 2 kitchen managers are yelling out orders in that secret diner code. You order a Benedict Florentine? No my brother, that's a Vinnie. You've got a floor manager somehow keeping every order straight and calling out for runners, and these runners! They appear seemingly from the aether ready to get that Vinnie to your table, along with about 17 other orders, somehow not dropping a single plate.   It's like watching that hallway scene from Daredevil season 1, except you get waffles instead of adrenaline.   Everyone there was super friendly even amidst all the chaos of the brunch rush. I, being me, bugged the floor manager About different delectables as they would come out. I learned about corned beef and potato hash. I learned about strawberry butter (STRAWBERRY BUTTER!). Then something glorious happened.   I saw my order as it came out.   I have to tell you about the eggs. They have mastered the art of short order eggs. First, the scrambled eggs were dreamsicle yellow. They looked fluffy and creamy, the way I've only seen the Gordon Ramsay's of the world get them to come out. The omelettes (I got one) (more on that later) were like little pockets of sunshine. So yellow, with just the faintest hint of Brown when you get up close to them. The closest thing to it was the omelette I saw Jacque Pepin make on his tv show about 15 years back.   Ok. So lets talk about my omelette. It came out wrong. I ordered an American omelette with added asparagus (you can get asparagus in an omelette, and that's what life is supposed to be). The American is thinly sliced ribeye, mushrooms, onions and cheese. I got 1/3 of the way through my omelette, when I got the oddest notion.   You see this was one of the 2 or 3 best omelettes I've ever eaten. In all of life. It's easily the best from a technique stand point. The omelette was solid on the outside (remember the whole vaguest suggestion of brown thing?) But the center. It was like custard and souflee had formed a holy union in the middle of this omelette, and I was the only one invited to the reception. It's a testament to how good of an omelette they make that it took me a third of one too realize:  my steak omelette was missing the steak.   I asked about it, hoping to get some steak on the side, so I could finish the omelette as God intended. NOPE. What wound up happening was so much cooler.   First the shift manager, or GM - a young brother with a headset and veto powers (more on that later) - came up and had a short convo with me about how an American is supposed to be. \"Steak is supposed to be falling out the side of the omelette from the first bite!\" He said, or something to that effect. He then orders me up another American with added asparagus \"on the fly\". Cool right? I get to have the full American experience plus, I still have my fruit and bacon, which was now Former bacon. I ate all the bacon is what I'm saying.   I wait with my fruit cup, munching away on strawberries, continuing to marvel at the efficiency of the kitchen staff/ floor staff synergy. Another miracle happens.   I get not only the full American, steak literally falling out the sides, but my FULL FRICKIN ORDER again! Double fruit. Double bacon.   Now the veto powers. I get the first order comped. SOP, right?  GM sees my check, picks it up, and puts down another check. I look at it. Other than my coffee, he comps the entire meal. That's service above and beyond the call of duty.   Oh, yeah: I recommend and will be back in 2 weeks for those waffles."}
{"text":"Food was definitely great, they have a variety of breakfast entries to choose from. Even though it was a 30 min wait, it didn't seem that long. Since they allowed you to drink their coffee while you waited. The strawberry buttered waffles with chicken was good. Also their shrimp and grits were great. They also have a lunch and dinner menu, that's probably worth trying. I would definitely come back here again, the service was definitely 10 stars instead of five."}
{"text":"Sad to have to write this review because at first I really liked it here. Each time since my first visit when they opened, it keeps going down hill.  Monday night we came in for a little birthday dinner and brought our 5 year old granddaughter.  My husband ordered the French dip and at first when I saw it U noticed it was very low on the meat-mostly bread w cheese. While he was biting in I saw that he had to pull a large piece of fat out to keep from choking. He tried another bite and pulled a credit card size piece of grizzle out of his mouth and also put that one aside. He tried another bite and again another credit card size piece of grizzle. Finally when our nice server Dylan came to ask how we were doing, my husband pointed out the pile of inedible grizzle and the other untouched half of his sandwich, which he was afraid to try to eat, to keep from choking on more of the same grizzle.  Our server offered to send the manager Darius over to discuss the issue. He was nice but never asked what he could do to help-just said he was sorry and went to the next table. This was 4:30 on a Monday so it was not at all busy.  Dylan brought our bill and took our plate (my husband's still with half a sandwich) and when we looked at the bill we were still charged for that awful French grizzle dip! Can't believe the manager that came over never even adjusted it.  So part two of this one star rating just happened when I went to finish the leftover club sandwich I brought home from my meal last night. I bit into the sandwich and a long curly hair was hanging out of it!!!!! Disgusting! My hair is straight.  You need to get the ship tightened up over there before it sinks."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I'm in love with the chicken and waffles with their strawberry butter, and the pricing is also fantastic. Service was awesome and all the employees were cheerful and so friendly. Very cozy and personable atmosphere, will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a great anytime breakfast place! The coffee is good. But the cups are too small. Dritz were great. Pancakes are great. All in all a great place for breakfast or anytime you feel like eating breakfast."}
{"text":"Everything was great! Service is outstanding! Thank you Deanna for extra special attention. Def will be back."}
{"text":"This is our third time coming but this time around we were really disappointed with the food. My husband ordered the three egg breakfast and I ordered the avocado veggie wrap.  The service was great but the food was questionable.  The eggs were runny and biscuit was hard as a rock.  The wrap tasted good but one bite and all the food fell out on the otherside.  It was not tightly wrapped.  We will give them another shot but maybe at a different time of day.  Maybe the cook was in a hurry to go home or something."}
{"text":"I had the food here a few times but always as to-go! This past weekend I finally went in and dined in. The food is definitely much better than to-go, no surprise there!  Service was great, they were all very friendly. We were escorted to our table since one of us in the party was already here.  It was dinner but I opted in for breakfast food, and as always, there was more food than I could manage to finish by myself. I had eggs, bacon, hash browns, and 2 things of pancakes. My friend's fried chicken and waffles were delish. The chicken was so good.  Portions are nice and big, so I always have leftovers for the next day. I will be back another day for another dine-in experience."}
{"text":"I had been driving  by  this place  for a while and had to  check it out.    I have to  be honest, I gave this place an extra star because of the server we had, Tim :) He was such a cool guy and anyone that loves brunch more so than breakfast and hates runny  eggs is A-ok in my  book. Aside from that everyone here was very  attentive from the bus boys to the manager himself.    The place is always busy, but the service is fast and  food comes out hot. I had the huevos rancheros plate (about $10)  which could of fed a small family and my  friend had the corned beef hash (also  around $10). My food was very  yummy and his seemed to  be good as well, but the beef in the corned beef was the minced kind (like hamburger) and  not the shredded  corned  beef which I preferred. They had a number of specials on the board to  choose from as well and everyone was very helpful with their  suggestions or offering  substitutions when appropriate.   I would definitely come back here!  Oh oh wait....they  also had french vanilla flavored coffee and it was SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Came back in today for dinner.  Staff was great.  Greeted with a warm smile and my server was awesome and explained the specials and menu well and suggested the beef dip.  He recommended the Beef dip sandwich which my husband ordered with a side of macaroni and cheese.  My husbands beef dip sandwich was all fatty and very chewey.  He sent it back and opted for the chicken dinner which was ten times better.  I ordered the meat loaf which was kind of flavorless and it seemed the portion was much smaller then what I saw on diners drive ins and dives.  I guess I have to go to Florida to get the full treatment.  They took a lot off the menu like the stuffed blueberry French toast and the Pittsburgh sandwich.  :(. Wish they would bring them back on the menu.  For $41 dollars I guess i just expected the food to completely wow me and not still be hungry when we left.  With that being said next time I think I will try the breakfast instead of the dinner.  Maybe portions are bigger and breakfast will be on point because dinner was just okay.  Service was exceptionally better than yesterday.  Wish I would of got the young mans name and the hostess today was also very nice.  Will return one day for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great food and service. A new favorite restaurant for our family! Whether your are craving breakfast or meatloaf you can get it all! My favorite is the crab cakes egg benedicts!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast. Eggs Benedict, breakfast pie, and the French toast stuffed with cream cheese (there's a name for it). Very good breakfast plates but the French toast was soggy for our taste. Would come back to try something new. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Great place to dine! Food was amazing. I ordered the chicken and waffles and the strawberry butter on the waffles were amazing!! Chicken was moist and crispy. My fianc√©e ordered the corned beef hash and that too way so good! Usually we shy away from ordering hash because it's too dry and gross. Not the case with metro diner!!! Customer service was good but only thing that bothered us was it seemed like our server was faking being nice too much. Nothing wrong with that but being genuine would be a lot better. Will definitely go eat here again though!!! Glad this opened up next to our house"}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast spot. Food was good and service is always friendly. We've been there a few times and there is always a wait. It's probably better to get there early ... before the after church rush on Sundays."}
{"text":"Amazing experience!   Metro Diner Las Vegas absolutely carries the hometown spirit and flavor of the original store in Jacksonville, FLorida! The food is exceptional...! My Husband had the Chicken and Waffles and I had the Spicy Chicken Benedict Special ..both are AWESOME but of the two, the Chicken and Waffles stand out. The chicken is moist, tender,  and seasoned to the bone...even the breast. The waffle is light and airy...melts in your mouth when accompanied by the strawberry butter leaving an individual absolutely awestruck....! Aside from the food, our waitress, Finn, truly made the whole visit feel like home!  Finn's vibrant, loving, and caring, personality made us feel as though we were her sole purpose for ever working there.   Thank you, Finn, for your 5-star service! That service is so appreciated...! Additional thanks to Store Manager, Jim, who is another wonderful soul who has a love for where he is and what he does. That love shines through and touches your staff which in turn blesses Metro Diner,  Las Vegas, patrons.  Sincerely,   Mrs. Tanya Chavez-Clare"}
{"text":"Stopped at the Metro diner on a whim with my husband . What a great surprise. The food was amazing. I had the reuben sandwich with a side of mac n cheese. My reuben sandwich was mouth watering perfection. It was exactly made New York style. Mac - cheese was cheesy delicious. Also had the mango ice tea .The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The diner was spotless.I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went here on the 25th of May, we had family in Town and they wanted to try it out. I wrote a review about our disturbing experience here 7 months ago and i didn't want to discourage them from eating here so we just decided to have dinner here. We are a party of 9 and we were seated promptly for a Friday night. It was about 730pm and the restaurant seemed only a third full. Bottom line, this place needs to train servers when it comes to customer service. Our server gave us attitude, didn't check on us, had no service and gave us another bad experience. If you are looking for a sit down place where you and your family can enjoy a nice meal, then this is not the place. Maybe this is why there are a lot of businesses that are doing the cafeteria style dining,  where you get in line and place your order on a machine and pay it right then and there. Hopefully this place gets better. Food was good except the fried chicken was way too salty."}
{"text":"This has become my new go to diner! The food is amazing, especially the chicken and waffles. The service is good, quick and they have plenty of recommendations for new comers. Definitely give this place a try, especially for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"The server was nice therefore it's the only reason I'm giving any stars.  For the food itself: I had the Meatloaf and my wife had the Cajun Pasta. The meatloaf had a mushy consistency on the inside and I wasn't sure if it was under cooked. The outside with the slight sear tasted decent. It came with mashed potatoes that were tasty.   The Cajun Pasta was terrible. It looked like they threw in shredded bits of chicken and some stale brown sauce that was extremely over salted and was inedible. Even the Pasta was over cooked and soggy. However, The server was kind enough to notice and the manager took it off the bill.  I was really hoping this could be a go to diner spot for me since it's relatively close by and in a convenient location, but unfortunately I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Yes, We're coming back to this place!! Their chicken and waffle with the strawberry butter is the BEST, a must try for sure. My husbands Crab Cakes Benedict we're also delicious.  Their portions are big so go with a big appetite.  The waffles were fluffy and soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Their fried chicken was cooked perfectly and it's oh so crunchy and delish.  The waitresses were friendly and very attentive. They even offer coffee to go."}
{"text":"I ordered to-go, so I can't comment on the atmosphere or service, but the food was absolutely delicious. My husband got the chicken and waffle and I got a waffle with fruit on top. The portion for the chicken and waffle was HUGE, and the other waffle was a perfect, thick and fluffy Belgian waffle. Side note: the strawberry butter that comes with the chicken and waffle was heaven. This is my new regular breakfast spot. LOVE!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for down home cooked food, this is it. The chicken and waffles comes with literally half a chicken and served with strawberry butter. Be sure to ask what the tea of the day is! Portions are shareable."}
{"text":"Large portions for a great price! I got the chicken and waffles which comes with homemade strawberry butter. This butter is so yum you could eat it alone (no kidding). The chicken is seasoned to perfection and you can choose what you want as well (leg, thigh, etc). If sweet tea is your thing, be sure to ask what their tea of the day is. They offer flavored teas such as mango or peach. This place does not disappoint (either location)."}
{"text":"I came here with my kids to order brunch. The wait was 40 minutes which wasnt too bad. They allowed me to get coffee while I waited which was really good. When we sat down the waiter was very nice to us. my kids ordered from the kids menu. they are 7, 9 & 10. they ordered the waffle meal. I ordered my food as well. the kids food came first and to my surpsie it was very very little serving. my kids were shocked that they didnt get any eggs or meat to go along with their meal. and by the time they were done eating they were still very hungry. As soon as they finished i finally got my pancakes. so you can imagine how long it took. but the rest of my meal (eggs,toast, hashbrowns, ham) hadnt came out yet. I didnt want to seem rude so i waited about 10 minutes and still nothing. So I finally waved down the waitress. she told me they had to cut my ham fresh. apparently i was the only person in the restaurant who ordered ham. But i smiled and said ok. about 5 minutes later she finally cane backe at this time i was ready to go so i asked for a to go box. I asked her if i can get a discount and she said of course. to my surprise i only got 2$ discount after waiting a total of 40-50 minutes for my whole mean to come out. The food was good but i doubt i will come back. the kids serving is too small and with 3 kids i could have filled them up better with a $3 happy meal from mcdonalds."}
{"text":"Decided to try them out through Postmates. The time it took to get my food was about an hour, which isn't bad considering was lunch time. The food was delivered and it was neatly placed in containers, and they provided lots of condiments without me even asking. The pancake was huge and I struggled to finish it all. But overall the food was good and I am satisfied! Will def order from them again or visit the restaurant. Prices were good too for the amount of food I got."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot with greater service. Food is amazing. Must come to spot in Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"Ok, ya' all...I can tell you that this lovely diner is a must! I really could have given this new place 5 stars.  When me and my husband walked in for lunch, we were greeted right away. And the place was buzzing...It is a breakfast, lunch and dinner all of the time kind if place. The greeting was lovely and the service was exceptional throughout!  The food coming out of the kitchen looked ridiculously amazing...And, there is a menu, that is crazy looking delicious.  You may want to check out their fried chicken something (waffles, dinner, etc.). Or The, Hash and/ eggs benedict. Hash browns are crispy and look super delicious.  So, what happened with us was that my husband ordered the fish and chips. And I Had the specialty Pastrami with egg on top sandwich. (That was an amazing sandwich with fresh baked bread.  However, I think, Metro Diner missed the mark with the Fish and Chips because they used the Suewi fish(sp) instead of a traditional bass or halibut. Maybe catfish.  I had a taste and thought it was too mushy and a bit muddy for this dish!    However, the manager came by really prompt and was  gracious and personable.  Otherwise, you bet! Give this place a try.....I think you all would love it! Great Job Metro Diner!  Rene'e Weathers Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Went for lunch had a mushroom Swiss burger fries and sweet tea. Everything was perfect. Great food great service. Highly recommended!! A little expensive but worth every cent"}
{"text":"We have been here twice...the first time was a few months ago and the service was great hence the two stars.  the chicken and waffles would have been good if the chicken wasn't over cooked.   I decided to give it one more try...we went there tonight and the service was awful.  I  wanted pasta they only have one pasta dish so I tried it...it was actually sauce with little pasta.  My husband's burger was well done instead if medium....why ask if your going to serve it the way you they want to....The server didn't ask if we needed anything no refills no ketchup no mustard...she came back another time to give us our check...then we waited another five minutes before my husband went  to find her so we can pay...I still tipped the twenty percent because I too work...but I'd like to get food that I would have enjoyed after working all day. I don't think we will be back..."}
{"text":"This was a great place. They give you huge portions and I could not eat half of it. I visited this place with my family and all of us were pleased with our food. The waiter was extremely helpful and was very truthful. For instance, one of their fishes flaunted that it was a favorite but he wasn't afraid to say his own personal feelings on it. He gained our trust by his honesty and his suggestions (based upon our palette) were spot on. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went there for the chicken and waffles. It was fairly crowded but was seated quickly. Our server was Rachel who was great. The food came and the chicken was very crisp and we both thought it was among the very best we've ever had. The waffle was crisp but tender inside. There was so much food we had to take some home. There were so many other menu items that sounded good we'll have to return soon. Very highly recommended."}
{"text":"Omg, the most amazing burgers ever.  Must eat before you die. Amazing top notch service from all the staff. Our server Finn was great and attentive. Metro diner is a 5 star restaurant"}
{"text":"We have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this restaurant after hearing all the great reviews.  We tried two of the \"house specials \" the pot pie and and the meatloaf .  They were both awful . The vegetables in the pot pie were undercooked , and rest of it was tasteless .  As far as the meatloaf , they must think that quantity equals quality.  Just because there is a lot of food that tastes bad does not make it a good deal."}
{"text":"Since visiting our hometown Jacksonville, Florida where the restaurant originated from I was craving their chicken and waffles. The chicken is always nice and tender and the maple syrup and hot sauce combo and strawberry butter is always on point. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Lots of fun with family. Huge portions. Great food. I really liked the chicken pot pie."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for breakfast for the first time October 2017 and it was a success. Our table ordered the Belgium waffles, pork sandwich, avocado veggie wrap, and the San Fransisco Benedict. The waffles were so light and flavorful vs being heavy which made them a 5/5. The pork sandwich was huge but was also delicious. The Benedict was tasty and fresh but the wrap was underwhelming.  I also feel that the fries were a little bland and soft for my liking.  As for the service, I believe we had a great experience. Jaci was our waitress who was very attentive, energetic and with a good sense of humor. Overall, I would definitely return for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Meatloaf was great, fish was great. Nothing but good food here so far. Wish they were open later!"}
{"text":"GREAT NEWS!!! Applauds!!!   This Metro location is fantastic ...blows the Pineville location away, NO comparison whatsoever. This location has a solid management team, the host was extremely helpful & friendly. Our server was accommodating, personable and super sweet!   My husband ordered the pot pie ...it was so DRY you could have used it as spackle. The server quickly took it back to the mgr. they jumped into action and had it remade. They thanked us for bringing it to their attention... she had the kitchen tweak the process and the second time around it was very tasty. I would recommend ordering it with extra sauce, live & learn. It was delicious!  The mgr. came by our table to inquire if it was moist ...we told her it was \"perfect.\" She admitted it was super dry, nothing like straight forward candor & handling things proactively. #TRUEprofessional    My broccoli cheddar soup was equally as tasty!   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We are huge fans of Metro in Vegas, they score high marks across the board...at all levels which encompasses their very friendly host, staff and of course their food is the best!!   This location \"fell short\" :( ...first impression is the last & the host tonight did not even  acknowledge us when we entered the restaurant. What happen to \"welcome, good evening\" she did not even express a happy smile. BAD! We felt awkward, to say the least. She seems unhappy to be there and it effected our initial impression on this particular Metro location.  Not sure what management is thinking to place a greeter (host) with no inclination to welcome it's patrons. :( NOT BUENO!   Our server was very accommodating and serviceable ...although my cheddar & ham sandwich had a terrible appearance as the slice of cheese was hard and looked awful. Server took it back & had it melted, much better albeit would never order again.   My husband enjoyed his chicken & waffles, Vegas location had a tastier fried chicken. Not sure what is going on at this location ...it's under par in comparison to the Vegas location which is a bummer as I live in NC (at this time) not Vegas.   The manager checked in on our table which was nice .....overall we were bummed as we were expecting a similar experience like we had in Vegas.   *NOTE I believe it's lack of training and/OR this individual is just not cut out to run front of house. Everyone wants to feel welcomed irregardless of how good the food may be."}
{"text":"Place is amazing. Service was amazing. Food came out fast and all together. I orders one of their burgers and it was very filling. My wife and sister in law shared the chicken and waffles and it filled both of them and still had left overs. I would difentinley be coming back"}
{"text":"I was really excited when we saw a diner was going in down the street. Our server was really friendly and helpful and made yes feel very welcome.  I am glad to say that the food made me happy as well. We started off at the drinks bar for coffee. We had the nutty waffle which was fluffy and perfectly cooked. We also had the western omelette, also delicious. They included mushrooms as part of the omelet which was awesome. The hash browns were crispy on the outside and perfect inside.  We will definitely be back... maybe tomorrow."}
{"text":"We are regular customers of the Metro Diners,  in Pineville and Matthews and the service is usually pretty good with friendly and attentive staff Today, we were at the Pineville location and our experience was disappointing.  Coffee came without a spoon to stir in sugar,  steak was served without a steak knife nor steak sauce was offered, toast was burned and the server took away my husband's plate and silverware without asking if he was done, how did she expect him to eat his Mac and cheese side? Each time we mentioned was what wrong or missing,  she gave a smirk and walked away. And then she told us, \"next time you come, I won't take away your silverware\" Hopefully, Metro Diner will train their staff better."}
{"text":"The service is amazing along with their food. The chicken and waffles are the best and the Charleston shrimp and grits are fire!!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed! We went all family and friends for a dinner, we waited about thirty minutes before we got our table, on top of that another thirty minutes to get our food.. service was very rude! First and last time there"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. First time I was here, I had their famous chicken and waffles. I think it's so much better compared to Roscoes Chicken and Waffles in South LA California. Their sauce is SOOOOO GOOD!!! My good too spot for breakfast"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly and knowledgeable staff.   Prompt and courteous team.  The Breakfast Pie was delicious."}
{"text":"I wish I could say I still loved this place. However, the past two visits have been horrible. Three strikes you are out. Two times in a row messing up our orders and the waitress blamed the kitchen. The manager came over and told us in a nutshell that she had messed up all the orders in the restaurant and that Santa isn't happy. She wound up removing both meals from the check, and gave us a 10% discount for the next time we returned. Well we decided to give it another go. Same experience. Needless to say.... we won't be back."}
{"text":"I've dined here twice now, and have generally liked what I have tried at this diner that opens early but also closes fairly early to offset the near sunrise start (7:00 a.m. -- 8:00 p.m. Sun. through Thurs.;  7:00 a.m. --- 9:00 p.m. Fri. and Sat.).  A Salisbury Steak special of the day was savory and covered with tasty Brown Gravy.  A Brooklynn's Greek Salad featured Kalamata Olives, Feta Cheese, cucumbers, zucchini, Roma tomatoes, hard boiled egg, croutons, Red Onions, pepperoncini, carrot shavings, Iceberg Lettuce, and an authentic Greek Dressing.  The Chicken Pot Pie (I ordered a large, and was glad that I did) was very good, with a creamy inside and golden dough outside.  And unusually dark-skinned but moist Fried Chicken was excellent.  Service here has been attentive, with a managerial tableside visit each time to check on how things went.  And ambiance is deli casual, with basic but functional furniture.  The focus is squarely placed on well-prepared comfort food.  4-1/2 stars overall!"}
{"text":"The eggs Benedict was just OKAY. But their hash browns were EXTRA CRISPY which is KEY, the service was amazing, I love the atmosphere, and it's definitely an awesome spot for locals to grab a bite to eat. Definitely can't wait to come back again   Also, their specials looked promising. Who would have thought to create a hamburger Benedict? Pretty nifty!"}
{"text":"High cost, medium quality food. They have an abbreviated metro diner menu. No pound cake French toast or many other favorites. I was disappointed. Service was very good, two stars for the service."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Have been here four times now since open and never had a bad experience with service or food.  The servers are incredibly friendly and the food is fast.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place a bit over priced but nice and new love the big black board for the specials.. Corey was good splain the big TX burger so good √± messy yum yum .. The take the order on iPads table side faster and efficient...same thing big you are paying w a credit card..yeap prices a bit to high but ok on this part of tonw.."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try Metro Diner on Thursday evening for dinner. Prior to leaving I checked out the menu and the reviews and decided to try something new for me, Charleston Shrimp & Grits. I'm not a southerner but it sounded worth a try. First we were greeted warmly and offered a choice between a booth and a table, we chose the table. Our server was prompt, very friendly and pleasant. I found other items of interest but stuck with my decision and ordered the Charleston Shrimp & Grit while my wife ordered the fruity waffle. After a couple of minutes the manager came to our table to inform me that they only had one grit cake left and would I like an order of grits on the side as a substitute. I told no that was fine, one was all I would have probably eaten anyway. Our dinners arrived and I was correct; I never would have finished two grit cakes. My shrimp were plentiful, tasted fresh and were delicious as was the grit cake. I probably could have done with less sauce but who's complaining? No one made me finish it. My wife loved the waffles with fresh fruit. At first she said it was too much but she did finish most of it. I tried a taste of her dish and the waffles were flavorful, light, crisp on the outside but nice and tender on the inside. When our server brought the check I saw that the manager had discounted my dinner by 50%. This was totally unexpected but appreciated nonetheless. I'm sure they'll make it back in all the good comments I make to my friends who eat out fairly regularly. The food was delicious, the service excellent and the restaurant hospitable and very clean looking. All in all a really great first experience and I look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Very good food made simple. I love the meatloaf the best and their burger is worth the trip. A nice addition to the Gilead rd area."}
{"text":"Great food. Really good and friendly service. My new favorite breakfast place. Five stars from me."}
{"text":"Please read to see how this place is ran!!!  Me and my girlfriend ate here twice while visiting my grandparents at the end of September, it was great service and great food, 4 or 5 stars is what they rated based off of the regular diner experience but what really impressed me was the kindness they showed in the wake of one of the most tragic nights of our lives. My girlfriend and I were trapped inside the route 91 harvest festival the night of the shooting, we endured a horrifying ordeal while escaping the venue that night, we hardly slept when we arrived at my grandparents house that night but as the dust settled the next day my grandparents took us here for breakfast. I ate maybe 3 bites of my food, my girlfriend maybe double that, through the course of normal waitress conversation and the fact this was world news and we were in the town next to it only 12 hours later the waitress found out what happened, she talked to her manager, she talked to the regional manager I believe it was who just happened to be stopping by. They paid for all of our meals and extended their thoughts to us in this terrible time, they didn't have to do any of that but they did, that's a company that is run by real people unlike many others nowadays. The Polaroid at the bottom of the collage is all of us on our first visit that weekend before the shooting."}
{"text":"We had a gift card so we went. We ordered waffles. They were huge. We could only eat just past half each."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! Definitely get the biscuits and gravy. Love the drink bar with the coffee, sodas and teas. Gets crowded on the weekends, but well worth the wait. The portions are huge and definitely enough to bring home and make and entire other meal. Just what I've been waiting for; a great breakast place in Pineville!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Will definitely come here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Portions for chicken & waffles are great for two people. Friendly staff, Ricky the Host waited on me very nice & professional. First time visit to Metro Diner he gave recommendations. The cooks are awesome, they take the chicken & waffles to heart. I would recommend this diner & give it 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Me and my bf always try new breakfast spots and get really excited to do so. This place was by far the worst breakfast I've ever had. The staff were great all nice and knew the menu very well. But the food was terribly bland, I would assume salt and pepper are frowned upon there. My eggs were legit just eggs no salt no pepper no thing... the red potatoes that the waitress said were her favorite again had no salt or pepper just tasted so bland. The price is to high for that basic food. I'm not sure I could be payed to go back."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast last week with the wife and baby. The staff is so outgoing and nice and we hadn't even been seated yet. The atmosphere was pleasant and our waitress was fantastic. My wife and I both enjoyed our dishes. We are so excited that another location is opening up! Great service, great food and it doesn't break the bank. What a great experience."}
{"text":"The family and myself went for an early dinner on a Friday. There was about a 10-20 minute wait. We got sat pretty much after about 10 minutes. The food is good and taste great. Don't be fooled by the plate size. I tried the meatloaf and it didn't look it was going to fill me up but it did. The gravy is good and the vegetables were amazing!... the tables are a bit small if you have a big group or kids in high chairs (we had 2). The service isn't bad but I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 cause I believe the prices are a little high for what you get."}
{"text":"UPDATE REGARDING MANAGEMENT-I am updating my review regarding Peter and Tony, the manager partners, who have gone above and beyond to rectify this situation. I truly appreciate their time and care they have shown regarding this situation. They both have reached out personally to ensure they could discuss this experience and I have updated my rating just purely because of the two of them.    Absolute WORST experience EVER. We visited the Rainbow location last year before all the other locations opened and it was great! And we've been to the one on Serene several times and love it!! Don't even waste your time to come to this store. The manager, Lynn, spends her time with two other employees staring at their expo screen confused yet smiling and laughing as they point around trying to figure out the mess of their kitchen while then harassing customers outside the restaurant after we left!  Waited a good 8-10 minutes for our drink order and just put in our food order as well because it took that long for her to come to us, but the waitress was not our issue this visit. We ordered two Philly cheese steaks no onions, a French dip and the \"holy divoli\" burger medium rare. Then waited at least 20 minutes for her to continually tell us \"it's coming don't worry they're a little slammed up there.\" Then we notice her talking to the manager, Lynn, as they are looking at the order screen with one other girl in a pink shirt all looking confused and pointing to the screen several times. Lynn then comes over to us to tell us the kitchen messed up the medium rare burger and over cooked it so \"I'm the Mom and I made the call to just remake everything but it's at the top of the screen it will be right out.\" That sounded kind of nice due to not wanting one person to wait to eat, but we were slightly curious as to how they even knew they over cooked the burger? And my husband isn't picky enough to throw a fit over a slightly over cooked burger if they would have just explained when they brought it out; but we sure threw a fit afterwards. It then took 25 more minutes and our order was still not there! We finally see the burger up there and one of the sandwiches. Wait a few more minutes. Then the one of the sandwiches gets taken to another table!!! Mind you 7 other tables who got there after us got their orders while we were waiting. As soon as that other sandwich got delivered to another table and the burger that started it all continued to sit up there the waitress came over and we said,\"this is just crazy. If that's not our food up there we are just going to leave.\" She just walked away. Three minutes later and still no food nor has Lynn or anyone come by to say anything at all, we got up and left. I turned around to come back and ask for the name of the manager (Lynn didn't have a name tag on and at that time I didn't know her name). She then proceeds to chase me as I walk out the door shouting \"MA'AM MA'AM!\" And then followed me outside harassing me saying, \"I already paid for your food myself and it's fine just come back in and eat it!\" We didn't go there because we couldn't afford our meal! We just wanted to have a nice dinner. The \"B\" food grade on the wall on the way out was another clear indicator we should have just went somewhere else. I have never been so upset by a poor restaurant or service I've received. I've worked in the food industry and completely understand things happen. But Lynn's manager skills and behavior was completely unacceptable. As I got in the car another customer walked out and said, \"I just want to apologize for that restaurant. She was completely out of line.\" Very true. I will be calling their \"manager partner,\" Peter tomorrow morning."}
{"text":"Waffles are so good here the strawberry flavored butter is a good pairing for the waffles.  My girlfriend got the corned beef hash and it isn't the normal corned beef from the big can.  the corned beef was seasoned with coarse black pepper.  The nachos mmmmm mmmm.  I can't say what white cheese it was but the chips are nice and hot with chopped green onions, chicken, jalapeno.  Staff was nice, which you have to wait for a host to seat you and lunch is a busy time."}
{"text":"My son found this diner several months ago.. it has amazing Crabmeat Egg Benni .. Chicken & Waffles..The menu is served all day so if I want a sandwich it is available all day.. real comfort food... they also offer Grits..  Our favorite Server \"Hannah\" she is amazing.. she makes you feel so welcomed and at home.. This is one of the reasons we drive from the east side of town.. just to have her wait on us..the whole staff & managers are all really nice.. this is one of the cleanest restaurants I have ever been in.. They take pride in the environment and the food they serve.. I like that one will be closer.. but if Hannah is still at the one on the west side I would still drive there just for her to wait on me.. she is awesome.."}
{"text":"Go hungry is the best thing I can tell you. Food is delicious. Great breakfast! Eggs Benedict are fabulous, hamburgers are huge!"}
{"text":"I had a warm welcome and excellent service at the Metro Diner,  as well as probably the best chicken fingers I have ever eaten! They were fresh, hot and crispy. My friend had the shrimp and grits and really liked it. I am looking forward to going back and trying some more of their dishes, especially  the special french toast they have in the menu."}
{"text":"I'm so glad me and my husband came in today for breakfast , their hash brown was amazing ! Finally someone is making it the way I like it , haha.. Can't wait to come back to try their chicken with waffle and their signature burger !"}
{"text":"OMG...soooo good! Went there for lunch with my mom this weekend and it was awesome! The chicken and waffle is to die for and my moms pot roast was great as well! Good old fashioned gluttonous diner food! Our server Andy was fantastic. Oh, the coffee is great also! Can't wait to go back and try more things!"}

{"text":"Our current favorite breakfast spot (and we like a lot and go to breakfast often).  The combination of professional friendly service, interesting creative menu, and great taste is just right.  We even like the music mix.  Favorite items include the Bissel Breakfast and almost everything listed as a special..."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and food!!!!!!   Best chicken and waffles we've ever had, especially with the combo syrup and Louisiana Hot Sauce...who would have thunk?!!  The croissant French toast was okay, but nothing special and there were clearly other better food choices judging from the food on other people's plates.    We had a clear view of the most efficient kitchen!  What a \"well-oiled machine!\"  Staff seems to genuinely help out one another and are definitely friendly and responsive to the diners' needs.    Thank you to our server Monique who was so attentive and sweet!  A huge shout out to the manager Nick who seems to keep everyone (workers and customers) happy!  We will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"We are really lucky to have two great breakfast places close by on Eastern Ave. I have had Metro bookmarked for a while and finally came in for breakfast. Metro Diner is located in the Home Depot/Walmart shopping center at Eastern/Serene. A little bit of an odd location but we found it after a few minutes. We were seated as soon as we arrived.  Cindy was our server and was fantastic. Explained the menu and specials and really made us fell welcome as first timers. I chose the San Francisco benedict and my mom chose the bissell breakfast. I loved how they order on the iPads so the kitchen has your order before they leave the table.   The food came out pretty quickly. My benedict had sliced avocado and tomato served with crispy hash browns. It was very good. All of the flavors worked really well together and the hash browns were cooked just how I like them. The bissell breakfast was huge. Eggs, hash browns, toast, bacon and pancakes. Whew...you better be hungry! The pancakes were excellent, really light and fluffy.   Metro serves breakfast, lunch and dinner all day so is a perfect stop no matter what you are hungry for. I will definitely be back to try their famous chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"My family really enjoys this place. The staff is so friendly and prompt. They always make it a point to let my son help get his menu to the table. The food is great and it's a wonderful environment. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Choose any item in the menu and get blown away with nothing but greatness ! Thanks for the great food!"}
{"text":"Heard pretty good things about this new diner. The style & decor are very nice & we loved the vibe in there. A few issues tho. Had to get napkins and silverware from 2 other tables. The kids 6 mini pancake meal has too much pancake and should have a side. Both my husband's and my eggs were undercooked, actually sent mine back which I rarely do. The manager was great, but our server and the hostess were... eh. Our visit wasnt terrible though and we would go back to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Great food I really enjoyed the restaurant.  However the seats are not comfortable and it's very crowded And they rush you out of there quick but if you can overlook that go and enjoy your meal it's worth it."}
{"text":"We've been to Metro a few times now as it is so close to our house. Overall it is delicious with generous portions (enough to share or take home for later). The first time my egg was overdone but still yummy. I've also had the stuffing waffle with turkey and mashed potatoes--this was amazing! I hope they have it more than once per year. Today I had an omelet and it was perfect. Husband had the Monte Cristo--holy cow! So good. My order was originally wrong but they were quick to fix it. The service is very friendly. Great place for an indulgent treat or simple meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We've been looking for a breakfast place since we've moved here a year ago. This is it! Fantastic food and excellent wait staff. Ryker made our experience here very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great food. The price is very good for what you get, great tasting foods and LARGE portions. Ask for Christi to be your waitress. Very friendly and knows the menu."}
{"text":"The food had good taste to it, I got a mushroom Swiss burger and the main downside was that for the burger, onion rings, and a coke, it was $14 and some change, which is seriously on the high side, and then on top of that, the burger was extremely greasy. Literally dripping grease down my hand as I ate it.  They just opened so I'm sure they're still figuring all of this stuff out. I'll give it about a month or so and go back and try something else probably."}
{"text":"My husband and I have become regulars here because why wouldn't you be?! It's great location for us Southwest dwellers, and from the food to the service, everything is amazing. Food is always consistent (my favorite is the chicken and waffles and my husband loves the cheeseburger benedict special) and where else can you be welcomed in a restaurant with a hug from your server?! Darla has been our server the last couple times we have been here, and she is fabulous. We actually look forward to not just the food but to seeing her when we come in. All in all, stop reading this review if you're hungry, and go to Metro Diner now!"}
{"text":"Just the best place!  From the food to the atmosphere to the friendly staff.  Tucked back in a strip mall, this is well worth the stop. It was our first time, so our great server (Liz) was so kind to us and explained all the great in and outs of the menu and what Metro Diner was all about.    We got the Chicken and Waffles of course !  The sauce of Louisiana hot sauce and maple syrup made the taste special.  The butter on the waffles were on point!   Also, we got the Cinnamon Roll Pancakes and those were crazy crazy good.   You can't go wrong with this place.  We WILL be back"}
{"text":"Sister in law just flew in from Texas and was starving. Been passing this place for a few weeks. Stopped in for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised. Busy but not to loud, easy seating, great food and and service was great.. Will make it a regular stop."}
{"text":"Ate there yesterday. Great food, carimg staff but the only complaint was waiting for the waitress to retreive the payment. It was a bit annoying but sure won't stop me from coming back. Otherwise, she was on her game.  The decor is really nice. The food was good! Nice to have a local place like this."}
{"text":"They consistently have outstanding service, flavorful, and well prepared food, and a cozy, happy atmosphere. What else could I ask for? Their coffee is amazing. Their grits are delicious and are my favorite! It gets really busy on weekends around noon. Overall a true five star experience every time I've been. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Having new food options in the area is always a treat and having heard many people I trust saying Metro Diner is legitimately good I was excited to wander over with my $10 coupon.   We arrived on a weekday evening and order one fried chicken entree and a spicy honey fried chicken biscuit. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken but it was well prepared and tasty. The mashed potatoes were on point. For a chain restaurant I was pleasantly surprised by how well everything was made from scratch. I can't wait to return to try more of the menu soon."}
{"text":"I Will ALWAYS Go to Metro at least once during any trip to Henderson in the future. From the Excellent service -Thank You Patience! To the Awesomely DELICIOUS food I wish I had a Metro in Downey California where I live. I would be there 1-3 times a week. I am so grateful to yelp's help in finding Metro!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The food is scrumptious! It's good home cooking and they serve breakfast all day. The service is prompt and friendly. The managers were checking on all the guests the entire time. We will be back!"}
{"text":"It's just so average, nothing special. French toast looked burned. Tastes like I can make at home. Grilled cheese was good but again with the menu that's what we ordered as adults. Too many burger places to even try it here. This is not authentic at all and charges outrages prices for everything. Maybe be open 24/7 and become an actual diner with cheap and delicious breakfast dishes.  This is just like toast across the street, too expensive and not that good."}
{"text":"Place just opened around the corner we figured we would try it. service is nice place, the place is clean. Seemed to be more employees cleaning than customers when we went.    Ordered pastrami on rye with the homemade chips and the pork tenderloin sandwich with french fries.  The pork tenderloin sandwich was breaded but served with a bunch of other stuff far from what you get in the Midwest which is more of a basic plain sandwich.  Served on a Texas toast type bun the sandwich was ok.  Fries seemed to lack salt but an abundance of black pepper.  Overall it's just an average spot. Nice staff but food seemed average. May try it again and try something different next time  Pastrami was just average nothing special not real big not real small didn't have a lot of  flavor to it."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! We had the chicken and waffles and the Eggs Benedict. Both dishes did not disappoint. Hands down, the best chicken and waffles I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Okay so i took my son for his 9th birthday breakfast on Saturday February 24th. We were very disappointed in the food. The place was busy but there was no wait for a table the entire time we were there so it wasn't that busy. My sons hash browns were way over cooked and his toast was burnt, i gave him my hashbrowns cause they were okay. My eggs were not over hard they were slimy on one side and my toast was dry as hell with no butter at all. I asked for butter and after waiting for quite awhile i got totally burnt toast. I asked again for new toast and as we were about to leave i got one piece of okay toast. I was excited to bring my son for his bday breakfast but we were both very disappointed by the crap coming out of the kitchen. Also it seems like the old waitresses don't understand the pads they use to take your order. Unfortunately we will not be back and will go back to our regular breakfast spots, this time was horrible and will keep us away for good....."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Tremendous fried chicken and mashed potatoes. Super taste and really big portions."}
{"text":"Been three times now, all for breakfast and Metro has \"it\" down cold.  The menu, the ingredients and how they are prepared, the service...  All of it is just nailed and as one who used to go to the original Metro Diner on San Juan Avenue in Jacksonville, FL back in the day, I'm not surprised.  What's most impressive to me is how they've maintained the quality as they have scaled up and expanded across various state lines.  The food is great and the portions are just ridiculous for the price paid.  I haven't ordered the chicken and waffles yet but to see an order get delivered to another table is an OMG moment.  Looks like breakfast, lunch and dinner all served for one meal!  All I need to do now is remember that they serve more than breakfast and make my way there for lunch or dinner sometime soon."}
{"text":"Reese's waffle with chocolate chips, peanut butter, pecans, bananas and powdered sugar. Really good special. I overheard the training manager on duty strangely say to another table \"I'm just making sure your server doesn't drop the ball\". Other than that, this establishment has proved to be excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Dario was excellent. He was friendly and knowledgeable. He made sure we understood everything about the specials for the day. He even humored us with some playful jokes. I would recommend anyone who wants good comfort food to visit this establishment. We had the three egg breakfast and the croissant sandwich with soup. Everything was delicious and tasted like mom or grandma made it at home."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! They serve huge portion of food like its good for two and all day breakfast. My wife and I ordered chicken waffles with strawberry butter and chicken cajun pasta. It is affordable, for two people we only paid $35. Our server hilary L. took good care of us! A+++ service!! She deserve a raise! Also one of their cook came out to ask us how we are doing (thats so nice of him). I would come back because of their food and their friendly staff. I really recommend this place!! their food is one of the best food ive ever tasted, very clean place and very friendly workers."}
{"text":"Really, nothing special here. Had the turkey and mashed potatoes. I've had better for less $$. Waitress was a little forgetful, had to ask for my cranberries, then my roll, but finally got it together."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here right as they opened at 7 am & the smell was delicious as you walked in. The service was great! I had the croissant French toast. Portions are pretty big. We were explained that the pancakes we ordered were a small but they covered the whole plate. Hazelnut coffee was very tasty. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"So I was so excited to eat here..i celebrated my 50th bday last fri..and was asked where I'd like to go eat..i chose metro diner..walked in .. wasn't that busy..we stood up front no1 up there..so we didn't know if we're suppose to seat ourselves or wait to be seated..finally a server came over and sat us..she was running around .. finally got our drinks..she was friendly enough..then a nice man came over and spoke to us..i assume he was the gm..we ordered the fried chicken dinner..i got fries with mine. and a side salad..a huge plus the ranch was homemade..we waited a long time for our food..server came over and apologized that chicken was taking longer then expected..we ok..no big deal..at least we know it's fresh..we got our food..1st off my sister had mashed..i can't believe they serve brown gravy with fried chx dinner..my fries you can tell had been double fried..no season..just bland..so we bit into the chx and it's raw..pink all over inside..i asked to see manager..he finally came ..i think he had to have been the assist.. manager..we told him ..he was so rude and was trying to argue with us..and looked at the chx and acted like nothing was wrong when u could clearly see are chx was raw ..he said the fries were fresh..i work at a high volume rest..in a casino..so I knew they were not..he was very abrupt with us..he has no business dealing with guest..he was also back thr cooking..my managers would never nor would I speak to a guest the way he did..i can deal with the raw chicken and just order something else..however i can not tolerate a rude employee..we were very nice...i asked for the gm..he was training..so I flagged a gentlemen over who was the gm at a different location..he was great..he knew hiw to handle a guest recovery situation..he offered us a whole meal on the house..i declined..he gave me two 13 dlr..coupons.. I honestly want to call corporate about the assist managers behavior..needless to say i don't ever want to patronize that location again..not because if the food..because the way we were treated..."}
{"text":"Metro Diner is new to our neighborhood.  Had lunch therlast week.  We found a crabcake salad on the specials board and it was very good.  It was served without bread or crackers.  The room was noisy and crowded.  I might like it better when things settle down a bit.  Servers were responsive, helpful."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this diner. They have the friendliest service with a genuine diner feel to it. Every time I'm there, I forget that I'm in the Sin City but rather, at a small town where everyone knows each other.   The first time I visited, I got a burger with mac and cheese with it. Deliciously sinful filled with flavorful seasoning along with it. Along with that, the texture from all ingredients made it a delicious meal. At the same time, my girlfriend got the Philly Cheese Sandwich to which she was very happy about. The buns were just right with a generous amount of meat along with it. A must try.   The second time we visited, I got their famous meatloaf to which delivers in taste. Wow. I've never been a huge fan of such an entree but I've changed my mind. Along with its sides like the mashed potatoes and vegetables, it was an amazing meal over all. This is not and overstatement, you have to order their meatloaf. My girlfriend, on the other hand, got the hashed corned beef with a side of two poached eggs. Wow. Pair the two together and it heightens the entree. Definitely a must try as well.   My favorite from my visits there are their amazing cobblers. Topped with a classically-made ice cream and this dessert is the epitome of all sweets."}
{"text":"Easter day and we were starving, at 1:30 stopped in for lunch and had the best Breakfast. They serve breakfast all day! I got Chicken and waffles but substituted my waffle for the waffle special, strawberry cheesecake filled waffles .  The chicken was Ahh-mazing and it was so much food. The service is amazing. We just found our new favorite spot for bteakfast!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has that old diner feel to it. It's nice that they offer so many discounts. They offer military discount as well as if you buy one of their merchandise and bring it in while you dine you get 10% off of your bill.   The portions served were really big. I got the half order of the chicken and waffles and waffles given two waffles and 2 pieces of chicken. My husband got the chicken pot pie and that was pretty big also. Our friends tried the huevos rancheros and the diner favorite : the bold city burger.   Everything was good. I guess I misunderstood what the server was saying when ordering a half order because I thought if you get a half order of something it would be half the price. The chicken and waffles regular price was $15.99 and the half order was $10.99 which if I understood the server better I would've just ordered a full order."}
