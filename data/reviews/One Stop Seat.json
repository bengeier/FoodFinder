{"text":"It's really not that good. I'm giving it 1 and I'm serious. It's cheap for sure, and you know what it does feel cheap. It's worse than just normal. I sincerely suggest anyone who's searching for a comfy place for an enjoyable meal to avoid this."}
{"text":"This place has had a 6 year anniversary special on for 3 years now.  I went here couple times to try out the food and bubble tea. The food was not so good. I had a fried rice which was really dry and tasteless and my wife had a soup noodle which was greasy and soggy.  The bubble tea was average here. I wouldn't say it was good or bad, just average."}
{"text":"Perfect place to get some studying done on weekdays, weekends can get pretty busy. The SWEETEST lady works during the day, always makes the experience a pleasant one!"}
{"text":"Braised beef noodle soup is amazing! Broth is tasty and full of flavour, tons of noodles and beef is good. I'm extremely full for only $7.99.  Lady owner is the nicest person ever and she's always smiling and courteous."}
{"text":"So in reality you will walk by this place....even though you are looking for I know I did...even after I had been inside. It's right beside izakaya.  This pace has multiple names. One stop seat/stop and seat/ tea shop  So now the real review. The food is AMAZING!!!   Everything I've tried there my stomach has been very pleased. My favourite is the spicy chicken.  It's a meal it's self. It comes with well the spicy chicken, rice, green beans(best beans I've ever eaten) and tofu. The portions are huge and food doesn't taste like its the same sauce with different meat.   They have a HUGE selection in bubble teas though I have a particular one that I always order, mango slushi with tapioca, year around. Note to anyone out there who likes slushi it's under the ice part of the bubble tea menu. (Had an issue the first time I went)  The servers are very nice I feel like she knows the boyfriend and I by face. But sometimes there is the English barrier."}
{"text":"Super delicious bubble tea! What makes it even more delicious is the fact that it isn't over charged. The place is cosy and inviting. Sucks that its I front on Tea Shop 168. Honestly went there before I even noticed this place, give this store a chance, and haven't looked back ever since. Aha  It's a great place to sit and have a nice talk with a friend. I highly recommend this place :)   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I come here on occasion for bubble tea. I never had the food, so I can't really comment on that. The bubble tea is decent and reasonably price. I believe it's $2.80 for a regular sized bubble tea. Since bubble tea is so overpriced, paying anything less than $3 is a steal for me. The place is clean and quiet. The service is good. Overall a good option if you want to stay away from the bigger chain and busier bubble tea places."}
{"text":"Had the braised beef noodle soup and it was the worst I have ever had. The soup was very light and tasted like it was made from the powder from instant noodle packages. The noodle was very soggy. The beef was okay."}
{"text":"Love their original black milk tea! Great prices for their milk tea! The lady (I believe she is the owner) makes it the best and she is super friendly!  Their slushies and taro milk tea aren't the best (depends which employee makes it to be honest)  Gonna have to try out their food from all these reviews!"}
{"text":"It's a bubble tea place with lots of food options. The place was empty on a Tuesday night except for us and another table playing cards.  We only came to eat. We both had the braised beef noodles. Not the worst I've had, and not the best. I thought to myself that this place isn't so bad and probably worth another try. But then...  The menu they gave us said $6.99. When the bill came, it showed $7.99. I asked the lady about this. She showed me another menu where $6.99 was crossed out by hand and had $7.99. I could swear both our menus said $6.99 because we both stared at them for 15 minutes.   I was going to give them 3 stars but after writing this, I decided to deduct 2 more stars. Either she intentionally scammed us, or she simply forgot to mark some of the menus. She looked like the owner. I feel she should have known some of the menus didn't have the correction. Besides, I ordered by pointing at the item. If there's a pricing error, she should have told me at that point. I didn't really argue with her. I just left the place after paying, thinking to myself \"I'll never come here again\". What a stupid way to lose business. They got an extra $2 from me and lost me as a customer for a life time."}
{"text":"Scrumptious food, nice manager, cute children, free wifi, food comes with drinks during lunch, lots of outlets to charge tablets and phones, very considerate restaurant! Big portion of food! Cheap takeout bubble tea only $1.99!  Sincerely,  Valerie"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this is written as \"nightlife.\"  This place is a little restaurant for bubble tea or homestyle Taiwanese food/snacks.    It's confusing because you can call it by its Chinese name \"One Stop Seat\" or \"Tea Shop\"  -- it's a bit difficult to actually explain to someone where this restaurant is.  I guess that's the good thing about it because there won't be too many people there when I go there.    The bubble tea there is great and inexpensive.  I always get the loganberry and rose bubble tea with tapioca.  It's absolutely delicious.  Not only that, the Taiwanese style braised beef noodle soup is one of the best things located there.  I've been trying to find more places that sell this, but it's very difficult (or maybe I'm not really searching for it).  Not only this, they also have FREE WI-FI.  Screw going to Starbucks or Second Cup - this place has free wi-fi.   And being the Asian geek that I am, they also play teeny bop Taiwanese and Korean pop.  Nice little place to hang out with friends on a nice little afternoon."}
{"text":"Out of the many bubble tea shops on Yonge Street, I think this place is pretty decent. I've been here numerous times and have tried the bubble tea and food.   Some prices of the food has been increased but my favorite is the Braised Beef Noodles. They give a good amount of noodles and beef, the soup base is very flavorful and every time I order this the quality is the same. I usually order the Original Milk Tea whenever I order the drink its perfect but if its too sweet they will offer to remake it.   The people here are very friendly! I enjoy coming here because its not overcrowded like other bubble tea shops like 168."}
{"text":"This place has a special place in my heart. It's conveniently located in the heart of North York. Every time I go to do my weekly groceries at Loblaws (Empress Walk), I stop by this place to have lunch. That means I visit this place at least 3 times a month ;)  They have an extensive food menu that consists of Chinese and Taiwanese comfort food. Their bubble teas are cheap and yummy. I like to alternate between Taiwanese Plum Green Tea and Pudding Milk Green Tea :)   I have several favorite dishes: 1. Shredded Pork with Cucumber Noodle Soup ($6.99) Delicious broth, yummy shredded pork, al dente noodles. PERFECT. And don't let the name trick you. They don't put cucumber, they put sour mustard veggie (google that!) and some bokchoys.   2. Braised Beef Noodle Soup ($6.99) Again, delicious broth and noodles. Unfortunately, the beef brisket can be tough sometimes (they don't cook it long enough). But the broth usually makes up for it. I can just eat the noodles and the soup :D  3. Chicken and Salty Fish Fried Rice ($6.99) I'm going to sound like a broken record here but THIS DISH IS DELICIOUS!!!! Diced chicken and salty fish bits make an interesting combination that I always crave for more :)  4. Fujian-style Fried Rice ($6.99) Again, don't let the name \"fried rice\" fool you. They do use fried rice but they drench it with Fujian-style seafood and veggie stir-fry. It doesn't look like your typical fried rice, but it's good nonetheless :)  5. Crispy Chicken on Rice ($5.99) Whenever you order \"something on rice\", you'll always get fried tofu and stir-fry green beans on the side (and they're delicious!). Crispy chicken is one of my favorite rice dishes. Try it!   A little tip: if you come on Sundays during lunch time, they have lunch specials where you can choose 1 out of 25 items from their regular menu PLUS a green or black tea (cold/hot) for $5.99 - $6.99, depending on the food.  The lady owner works on the floor from time to time. She's very very very nice and she always remembers my favorite orders :p"}
