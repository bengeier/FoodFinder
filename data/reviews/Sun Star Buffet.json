{"text":"Went back today and had a much better experience.  The food was nice and fresh and everything was good.  Walked in and was greeted pleasantly by the lady at the register,  Gave her my 7 bucks and ate too much.  The huge plus was they had General Tso's chicken.  Love it.  Walked out and she wished me a happy weekend.  I will go back once my Chinese Buffet timer resets.  I think the thing to remember is this place inst in the best area.  Its not dangerous or anything.  Would honestly be 5 stars on this visit but the place is a little rough.  You literally sink in the seats."}
{"text":"The place seems sketchy to be honest. Despite the location, the food is delicious! Their chow mein is fantastic, better than Panda Express. The workers are nice, greeting you properly. Their Horchata water is so good! Last time i went their to \"Take Out\" i asked for a cup and they gave it to me for free."}
{"text":"This place was so run down. The food was cold or warm. Flavor could have been nice to have. Drink station looks as if it has not been touched in years. Staff were not happy. Only one marked exit! A woman walked in covered with items for sale.... Really? Not sure how this placed passed any health inspection. No grade was was seen posted. Do NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Run down, terrible food and overpriced. The staff seem to hate being there. The girl who took my money wouldn't even get off her cell phone.This place is a nightmare, don't waste your time or money."}

{"text":"Go west for fun adventure and good values. West of the i17 that is.

With some convincing I got a few of my co workers to try this place. From my office at 18th ave there are 12 Mexican food places before we reach this lone Asian Buffet.

Walk in and you pay $6.50 plus tax for all you can eat and drink soft drinks. 

Grab a plate and marvel at the eclectic mix of foods, many Chinese favorites, some buffet usuals like the wide mix of fried foods and random jello deserts, and then discover the most out of place and best thing, GARLIC BREAD. 

For veggie they had bean sprouts, lo mein with veggies, a veggie fried rice, fried bananas, butter potatoes, french fries and fresh doughnuts.

They also had a good amount of fish, some type of skin on roasted fish in a butter sauce, a fried fish and fried whole tilapia.

I was very happy to see a wide range of hot sauces to put on the food including siraca at the tables, chillie oil and chillie paste.

The Booth are very 1986 looking and are well sunken in.

Overall the value and quality here is good and none of us got sick afterwards so it passes that key test.. Their last few heath ratings have been all silver, so give it a try!"}
{"text":"It's a buffet not the Bellagio. Food was hot and fresh. Easy access to everything. Great variety for a fair price (Under $10 for lunch). 
Place was clean. I will agree they are not sparkly people but I am not looking for entertainment. Perfect for what it is. We will be back."}
{"text":"Not the business! Went there one time, and the fountain drink machine was down, in place they had two liter sodas out! The food was not to palatable. I would not go there again, ever!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing special.  I would not go out of your way to dine here, but if you do happen to be in the vicinity go ahead and give it a try.  It's a standard chinese buffet with medium selection.  The price  is a good value as drink is included in the buffet price, and you can definitely walk away full.  My main problem was that most of the dishes seemed to use the same generic brown sauce so there wasn't much variety in the flavor no matter which dish I chose which was somewhat disappointing.  They did not provide any type of cocktail sauce for the peel and eat shrimp the day I was there, so that was a negative for me as well.   Overall, I would eat here again but would not make a special trip to do so."}
{"text":"Thought we would give this place a try since it always seems packed when driving by! Upon entering the place it was very run down I was greeted by a very unfriendly man that did not look up to even acknowledge our arrival was told 20 bucks for to dinners my rad was thrown to me and not even a thank u or enjoy your dinner. Food at this place was very cold and had no flavor, no of the employees looked happy to be here when we sat down a lady that was sweeping the floors started sweeping under our table not even say excuses me! I will not be returning to this place and I don't understand how this place is still in business ."}
