{"text":"Sometimes it's nice to get Indian to go and watch a good movie at home to get the weekend started. God, I really don't sound like the childless 20-something that I am.  I ordered Shahi Paneer (easily the BEST paneer I've ever had, taste and texture-wise) and it was so delicious. My husband ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and said it was the best he has ever had. I also loved their rasmalai which, again, had the perfect texture and flavor. We've been going to another Indian restaurant for years (a 20-25 minute drive) but have recently been underwhelmed by the food. I decided to try this place and I'm so glad that we did. Not only is it great, it's just around the corner from our house. Bonus!"}
{"text":"This place was quite the surprise. Delicious! We ate both vegetarian dishes and the Bitter Chicken. Cabbage and peas are tasty! The owner was helpful and friendly. He offered us advise on Indian Cuisine. We will return. Our bellys are full of delicious, healthy food! Try it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! They have an awesome buffet that is extremely reasonable! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Small little hole in the wall place, a little run down but I've found those places to have the best food! We were greeted by a very nice man and a waitress who sat us at a booth. The table cloth was dirty, I'm assuming from lunch.. Service was great! We ordered aloo matar (medium), it came out in good time. The dish tasted good but was lacking in spice and flavor, it was just good. The garlic naan we ordered was a little Burt on the bottom. I think I'm spoiled by dehli palace in Tempe. It wasn't bad but not good enough to make a special trip back. The reviews were so good! I think my expectations were a little high."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved!  Looked up on yelp, read great reviews and tried it out! !! Thanks for the great service Meghan and to the chefs. ..keep up the great work.  We'll be back! !!!"}
{"text":"I was quite pleased to stumble upon this Indian restaurant.  The place is small and lacks in decor but the service and the food was well worth it.  My only complaint was that he chicken tandoori, although delicious, was a bit too salty.  The samosas were great as well as the garlic naan.  I have recommended this restaurant to my friends.  I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Very nice samosas and garlic naan freshly prepared.  Next I will try the lunch buffet.  It's nice to have a good Indian restaurant round the corner!"}
{"text":"My family and i were very excited to try Curry Garden. Unfortunately I got a peak back in the kitchen. Not very sanitary to say the least. It's too bad because this place was recommended by people we dine with all the time. I was unimpressed to say the least."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Let a guy walk in while I was placing my order and cut right in front of me. I got an eye roll when I asked a simple menu question... And then to top it off, he continued to talk on the phone while I was trying to place a to-go order. I have visited this restaurant two months prior, and loved the food... Needless to say I did not place my order this time and walked out. I went elsewhere. No thanks."}
{"text":"We went here yesterday to check it out after reading the great reviews. They were actually closed for maintenance when we arrived. However, the owner and one of his staff saw us outside and let us in!  The service was amazing. The food was hands down one of the best. We ordered the sampler appetizer, chicken Tikka masala, chicken gorma, chicken curry, and chicken byiriani. We loved every single dish."}
{"text":"Lamb vindaloo with some extra spice - phenomenally good; ate it with some tasty roti.  Looking forward to coming back on a weekend to try their house specialties.  Final test if the night will be the tea. :)"}
{"text":"Kerala food available here !!!! Off the menu though and call to confirm!!! Tried the mutton with the bone and it was fantastic! The Kerala chicken curry prepared for that day also good!   bit of a wait for food though but worth it."}
{"text":"Loved chicken tikka... Chicken was juicy and tender. Had shrimp biriyani for main course and it was really yummm... Was happy to have found this eat out :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Any of their curries is delicious. I specially enjoy their lamb curry."}
{"text":"Terrible food really. The chicken biryani tasted more like a desert than main course. Was full of fennel seeds, cashew nuts and raisins. Kadhai paneer that my husband ordered had no flavor at all. Needless to say we had a hard time finishing our meals. Taste seems more catered to white folk who usually favor a low level of spice. Not recommended if you want to taste real Indian food."}
{"text":"Excellent Kerala food, especially fish curry and mutton fry..Reminds me of my mom's cooking.We live about 45 minutes from this place but it was worth the drive and we will be coming back often.."}
{"text":"Best indian food 5 plus , authentic, great service, definitely a place to go if you are looking for south indian food, not the usual stuff from Taj Mahal"}
{"text":"Saw the new restaurant when we were driving on Elliot last week and thought we would give it a try.  Biggest mistake!  The food and service both were bad. The food was very bland and absolutely had no taste(not even good amount of salt!). We asked for a couple of dishes and both were not available ('cause they ran out of ingredients). The dishes we ordered (Navratan korma) did not taste as it should. Looked like some frozen vegetables were cooked with pre-made masala (spices), and needless to say it was tasteless too! We ordered Veg Pulav and it was mainly peas.   And we had quite a bit of food leftover (from appetizer), and the guy never asked for boxes, just took the food out! Would never go there again!  And oh, the water tasted funny too!"}
{"text":"Great food, I love the buffet.  My only wish is that the buffet had more items!  Some buffets around the area have 2x more options so you can try new things.  Overall the restaurant is great, service is great, and the food is delicious.  I just wish the buffet had more items."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is so flavorful and tasty. I recommend the butter chicken veg korma and/or chicken korma. Plus can't forget the naans. My fav food place.  The staff is very personable."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food, perfect spices. Mutton curry was awesome and so was Chicken korma. In starters we had Chilly Chicken which one of the best I had."}
{"text":"Wow the food is so good here. The service is personal and polite. Im leaving feeling great, 5 stars because I cant go any higher."}
{"text":"Was skeptical to try based on reviews but sooooo glad we took a chance.  Lamb curry was wonder... Rice was solid and naan was great.  We also had Mango shakes, different but we enjoyed.  Our neighborhood Indian place now."}
{"text":"I tried this place on a weekday. Service was bit late. But thats oki. Tried paneer tikka. Wow. If u tried sizzlers it is more or less the same mode. Naan and mix vegetable curry. It was good.  Have to try their buffet once"}
{"text":"This place is just lovely! As we entered the restaurant we were greeted by the very warm and friendly manager.  The place was very clean, and they had a TV on with Indian music videos.  The service was top notch and the food was very fresh. because it was a late nite meal and we did not want to eat too much, we shared a wonderful creamy paneer tikka masala dish with sauce that was perfectly made with just the right amount of spice.   We chatted to the manager throughout the meal and his positive energy made for a very enjoyable time.  I am so excited that this place is located so close to where I live and I can't wait to try out the buffet"}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet with some tasty naan. Food was very good as was the service. Looking forward to trying items off the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome Indian food! I did pickup with online ordering, which was easy and quick.i got the lamb vindaloo, which had an awesome spice profile. Also got the garlic naan, which was also tasty. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Special kerala food on the weekends. There is no other place in the valley you can find this, what more can a malayali ask for :)"}
{"text":"The layout inside is different, pretty small so may not be ideal for larger groups...but let's be real, I was trying it alone & liked having one of the 3 or 4 booths alone (don't worry, I wasn't being a booth hog, the place was empty aside from myself & one family).   I had the chicken vindaloo \"medium spicy\" and got chicken tikka masala to-go for the boyfriend. My vindaloo portion was huge, enough for two. But my boyfriend's order seems a little skimpy. My only complaint (as far as flavor) is neither order was spicy enough. Next time maybe I'll ask for \"full-on\" spice and see how that goes, eek!   The family behind me ordered chicken skewers and the smell was ah-mazing!! I would definitely like to try that in the future. Just the smell had my mouth watering, imagine the taste bud party after actually eating it.   Closed Mondays, whaaat."}
{"text":"Yeah not bad. Not amazing. Service was not great. Food was ok. Place was empty. You know, not great. Not bad. Just ok."}
{"text":"This place has great food, however, they are SUPER stingy on things like rice. Also, be aware that if you order online, they DON'T give complimentary rice like they do if you order over the phone and when asked why, he said it's to make up for the cost that yelp charges them to use the online service......."}
{"text":"Not able to decide what was worse: The customer service or food. Naan was chewy, gobi in gobi Manchurian was raw, paneer tikka sucked!!"}
{"text":"We live nearby and finally decided to give this place a try...and WOW! Super fresh and delicious food! Don't let the interior turn you away...the food is extremely good! Probably the best Indian cuisine I've ever had ! So FRESH! Can't believe we've driven past this place all the time and never tried it before . For sure will go here again...and again...and again !"}
{"text":"I found Curry garden by driving pay and saw the sign, decided to give it a try,  good Indian food is hard to find. The place was small but nice and very clean, lunch buffet was small as well but very good. Service was excellent.  Will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"Disappointed is the word.  Indian food should never, never, ever be bland.  Bland is the opposite of Indian food.  It doesn't have to be smoking hot, but the flavors should always be strong and vibrant and aromatic.  Always! Not here, unfortunately.  We came for the lunch buffet because it seemed well received by fellow Yelp users.  First thing I noticed was that it is very small.  Not necessarily a bad thing, some of the best Indian buffet experiences are with small buffets.  The food here is bland, some nearly tasteless, and that is a bad thing.  It wasn't gross.  It just wasn't very good.  The kheer was about the only appropriately spiced, flavorful item on offer.  Service was good, friendly, and the place was clean.  No complaints on that front.  It was inexpensive.  But that was a huge amount of calories that just weren't worth it.  I am, as I said, disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was great, but they were out of a lot of things. Service was pretty bad, I had to keep reminding the waiter to bring the rest of the dish (waiter didn't know that you serve rice with a curry ... really). Food seemed a bit overpriced as well. We went on the weekend so it wasn't the experience we were looking for, though I could see this place being really good for the lunch buffet. We might come back, but only because there aren't many indian restaurants around."}
{"text":"Excellent food. They will spice your dishes to your request, so if you don't like spicy be sure to let them know. The chicken tikka masala was perfect."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It only has 5 tables and the service can be a little slow. But the food is legit, good prices, nice staff, and the restaurant smells amazing."}
{"text":"wow, we're going to be eating more Indian after finding Curry Garden.  I got carryout once. Very good value, great food."}
{"text":"Wow the best Lamb Korma I've had! Third time dining and we loved it! The owner was cheerful and informative. We shall RETURN!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today at lunch. We had the appetizer sampler, lamb with spinach, chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. So incredibly delicious! Spice level was on point, flavor of the sauce was insane on the masala, lamb was super tender. Place was clean and service was perfect. Highly recommend. Will be back sometime to try the buffet."}
{"text":"I haven't been using Yelp for a few years and this review was supposed to be posted back in 2015 and didn't realize it didn't post.  No worries, their food is still great! Still our fav Indian place in AZ!  I am so excited to find such a great Indian restaurant in Gilbert!!  I was in search of a great Indian place in AZ and I found me one in Scottsdale a while back.  Even though that place was very far from me, we went back there almost every week, but like many good restaurants in AZ, that one didn't last long and the ownership changed.  Needless to say, I was really disappointed and was hoping for another good place.  Who would've thought I'd find one in Gilbert of all places?!?  This review is kind of overdue...my husband went and posted this for me from my draft so if there's any glitch, I apologize...I had an unfinished draft sitting on my desktop of my Mac, and he went ahead and posted it saying he can't believe I didn't review this place yet since this place is so great!!  LOL!!  SO we found this place about a year ago and been going back, at first every week (kinda crazy I know, and then we kind of eased off to once a month now.)    So our family of four, including two teenage boys who are true foodies (eaten all over the world at some fantastic places from hole in the walls to Michelin star restaurants,) love love Indian food and love spicy as well.  We usually order Chicken Tikka (The British Indian dish which we've had the best in London), Lamb Vindaloo (ordered spicy), lamb biryani (whenever they have it), and naan.  So we ordered exactly the same at this place to see how they compare to other mediocre Indian restaurants in AZ.  We usually can judge the place by their chutney and their chutneys were pretty good.  Complimentary papadum was just ok.  Chicken tikka was creamy with touch of spice and just buttery good. Chicken were NOT dry as is at most Indian places!  Lamb Vindaloo, ordered spicy, was absolutely heavenly!  I hate spicy where it kills your taste bud and you can't taste anything except for the spice.  This was flavorful and not just pepper spicy.  Very good!  I loved the little sour onion bulbs in there which enhanced the flavor of the curry.  Lamb biryani was pretty good as well although not the best I've had.  Their naan was delicious and best eaten fresh.  We also ordered their tandoori chicken.  OMG!  Usually I avoid ordering tandoori chicken at Indian places in AZ, because they're usually dry and hard to swallow.  Theirs was tender and flavorful!    Overall, very good place and I don't mind their service.  The waitress was kind of off, but when food is this good I don't mind the service at all as long as they don't throw dishes at me or give me dirty water.  haha  I've noticed the people who are giving this place a low rating are compalining about the service and the buffet food.  We've tried their buffet once and yes I agree that their buffet food are less tastier than the ordered from the menu food.  I strongly urge you to order from the menu and make sure you tell them the strength of the spice you want if you want them to be spicy.  The owner George is a super nice guy and he will cater to whatever you desire.  Their wait staff are not too good.  They're not mean or anything, but the service can be slow.  The food can be slow at times, but you know you're getting freshly cooked food and trust me, it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. the service is really nice and its a good environment. Love Indian food so this is my go to place."}
{"text":"After reading some Yelp reviews my fiancée & I decided to stop in and have dinner. Brother - let me tell you!!! Wow! The service was fantastic and sincere. The food was delicious and I thought the prices were reasonable. The ambiance is simple and the bathrooms were super clean.  I will return!"}
{"text":"We mainly do pick up orders from this place. Our boys don't care for the food so every now and then we would order for ourselves. The chicken tiki Marsala is delicious and the sauce. We always like to get the garlic naan. We would like to try the place during lunch to try other varieties. The place is small but has good service."}
{"text":"Oh my Tasty!!  This was a great experience!  I haven't had Indian food in well over a year, and this introduction back to it was PERFECT.  Curry Garden is pretty inconspicuous from outside... and inside lol They have a drive through, which was a little curious, but now it makes perfect sense.  The inside was just a few small booths and a couple of tables, and a TV playing an Indian musical.  The gentleman that served us had an EPIC mustache; we were instantly facial-follicle-friends ;-)  I had the Paneer tika masala which was PERFECT, with a side of Garlic Naan.  My family (mother, Wife and son (4 months))got a few other dishes, all of which were incredibly tasty.  OH, I also had the Samosas, which were great as well; their sweet-hot sauce that came with them weas excellent.  I also need to mention how friendly our server was; he checked on us frequently to be sure everything was going well with our meal, kept out water glasses full and a carafe on the table, and gave us a HUGE container of rice to take home to eat with our leftovers.  I can't wait to eat here again! One more thing! I did see that they have a lunch buffet, and I know there is at least one negative review on here about it.  BUT having experienced their food, I would be VERY surprised if their lunch buffet was as bad as that reviewer made it out to be.   Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"I really really really wanted to like this place after all the great reviews I've read, plus it's really close to my house. Unfortunately, we were pretty disappointed with the food. Got lamb curry and chicken curry. Both had very little flavor, lamb was really rubbery, and chicken had several pieces that were uneatable. They didn't really trim the chicken before they cooked it. Not good.   There are other Indian restaurants around that offer more flavorful, better cooked food. Their flavors must be watered down for suburban Gilbert."}
{"text":"Very good food, fair prices and portions.  Will definitely be back.  On the down side, they never provide enough rice on to-go orders."}
{"text":"Food is REALLY good.  The service is horrendous.  I have been here several times and the service gets worse each time.  I can't take it any more so I won't be coming back.  Nobody else in the place and yet I had to wait 20 mins just to get a drink and another 10 after that to even place an order.  Food is good but not worth that much of a wait.  The only time I got quick service is when they went to charge my card.  Sad because the food is awesome."}
{"text":"The food at this place was good overall.  I do like some of the other Indian restaurants that we have tried a bit better though.  I did appreciate that food was spiced appropriately as ordered.  My gripe would be I ordered a vegetarian dish and there were not many veggies in my dish.  Other than good flavor and good service."}
{"text":"Very nice whole in the wall Indian place really liked the food and service and food presentation. Really suggest you give it a try  it's very tasty and good for casual dine in or take out"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I think the food is two stars, but I rated this establishment as a three star place due to the price of the luncheon buffet.  Very reasonably priced at $7.99; with a drink, still under $10.  But a couple of criticisms-they open at 11 am and I went for lunch at about 11:20 and they were not ready.  WTH?  If your opening time is 11 am, then you should be ready to begin service at that time.  Also, they had some nice salad material on the buffet but no salad dressing.  The owner said he didn't have time to make it.  Again, not a good thing.  They only had two meat offerings -- both chicken.  One was the standard tandoori chicken which was mediocre at best, and the other was some kind of stewed chicken.  The other offerings were all vegetarian.    The chick pea dish was good and tasty.  But the vegetarian curry was not very good.  The vegetables were overcooked and mushy.  The lentil dish was very tasty but not enough actual lentils that provided texture and \"bite\" -- the dish was more like a pea soup.  No naan bread but white rice was on the buffet.  All in all, it was OK, especially for the price."}
{"text":"I went here for the lunch buffet. The service was great which is why I am still giving this 3 stars. The food was just okay. Everything they had was mild at best. Maybe ordering off the menu is better but I wouldn't go back for the buffet."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, food is excellent and the server was very kind and polite. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's been a couple of weeks since we had dinner at Curry Garden but I promised myself I'd eventually write a Yelp because this little restaurant was such a delightful surprise and deserves some more fans. Husband and I shared two vegetarian entrees which arrived quickly, hot, and exactly as we ordered. Sometimes you just can't get the Indian restaurants to go easy on the hot peppers. We asked for something between mild and medium and that's what it was. The waitress was a perky young woman who offered good suggestions and an upbeat attitude. The roti was perfectly made and there was enough to take some home for another day. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and large portions. Very friendly people and all vegetarian options are clearly marked. I will go back."}
{"text":"Went there at 1 50 pm. Was said they are closed since they ran out of food. Website lists until 2 30 pm and this is my second time being turned away. Will not even think about going to this place again."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  I love Indian food (actually I love most food), but I don't do very well with really spicy foods.  Hubs and I found this place on Grub Hub and thought \"what the heck, we'll give it a whirl.\"  And once we started, we can't stop.  We order from this place nearly every week!  Everything we've ordered has been absolute perfection.  We can specify the level of spiciness (so I don't die) and the only, and let me emphasize ONLY, downfall is there is a bit of a wait for the food.  But, it's so worth it that it doesn't even warrant subtracting half a star.  :)  We've tried many menu items, but our favorite is the Palak Paneer.  Most places you have to really dig to find those yummy little cheese cubes.  Not here!  This is stuffed to overflowing with fantastic little bites.  Also, the cucumber sauce is to die for! I could eat that cold and plain as a soup almost!  In fact, I did one night.  The restaurant is small, but always very clean and the owner/staff have always been super-friendly.  This place is a little gem in Chandler and I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great tasting foods all around!  The wife had lamb and I chicken and both were very good.  We recommend this place and will be eating here again."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is amazing, and the service is even better. Ani & Shoban always take such great care of me. I highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurant that I have ever been to in my 8 years here in the valley. The food was fresh and each and every item had different taste. Usually all the gravies will have the same base just the vegetable/meat will be different but here each and every one had its own authentic base.  Even the briyani had different bases like Chicken briyani had chicken flavour in the rice and vegetable briyani had vegetable flavour in the rice.   The service is little slow but its because they prepare the food fresh. I have been here twice and they never disappointed me. Try the Kerala food during weekends like Kappa, beef cry etc.  Must visit place for foodies."}
{"text":"Planned on coming here for Sunday night dinner. Too many bad reviews. Curry garden.......clean it up"}
{"text":"Happy that we finally made the choice to dine here. Started with an appetizer, Samosa which was fried potatoes and peas. These were freshly prepared and very tasty. Next, we tried the chicken tikka masala and vegatable curry. Both dishes were freshly prepared with distinct flavors. We like a little more spice to our food, however and will order our dishes with a little extra heat next time. All together a great place, just bring your patience since their is one man that serves, busses, and answers phones."}
{"text":"3.5 food was great, chutney one of the best. There were only Indian folks inside, so that's a good sign... tikka  masala and aloo were on point and samosas were great too. But the service was horrible. Super nice man, but not very attentive, we had to refill our own sauces, get our own silverware, we should have been on the clock."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating here once every 1-2 weeks for almost 2 years now and we love it.   The food is delicious. We've had food off the menu, at their buffet, and their weekend Karala menu and we've loved everything we've tried. Whether you want to do take out or eat in you can't go wrong.  The staff is super friendly and will get to know you if you're a repeat customer. If you're already a fan of Indian food or are wanting to try new things this is definitely the place to go.  Recommendations Chicken Tika masala Lamb vindaloo All their naan is delicious The beef dishes on the weekend is amazing (beef curry is a good choice) The buffet has different courses but we've loved the butter chicken and the vegetarian dishes as well"}
{"text":"They have excellent Kerala parota . The taste is authentic and we absolutely love it . We have tasted their fish curry and chicken curry which is good too . Be sure to ask for the special Kerala items as they generally don't offer in the main menu ."}
{"text":"I have tried couple of places for indian food in mesa , chandler . but i must say this place is not worth spending money . today i.e 22 dec i ordered some snacks and indian food , and i must say this was the worst ever prepared food i ever had . The food was so pathetic , chilly paneer was worst i ever had .pakoras were cold and oil could be felt rinsing from them . in all i would say i wont rocommend any one to go there and have anything from there."}
{"text":"Loved their \"mutton curry with bones\". It was tender and delicious. Also loved the \"Kerala Paratha\" that the owner recommended. (The later is not in their menu.) Will go their again."}
{"text":"Nice clean place. Has verity of options. If you're go around 11 am it's less crowded. Serves both Indian dishes but, they also have Kerala style dishes as well. All in all a great place"}
{"text":"I love indian food, let's get that clear right now. I like my food spicy and delicious. I found both qualities at Curry Garden. The staff was extremely friendly, she waited on us hand and foot, she even asked me how I wanted the lemons for my water cut !! This may seem overbearing, but after we got our food she told us she didn't want to crowd us, so just to flag her down if we needed anything. AMAZING SERVICE!!  the food was breath-taking. I took one bite and my boyfriend was concerned for my sanity. I let out a full groan.  Semi-embarrassing, but I couldn't help it!!! I can't go back soon enough. Definitely obsessed."}
{"text":"More like Curry Heaven! The Chicken Tikka Masala is some of the best I've had at any Indian restaurant. Pair that with Garlic Naan and you are in for an otherworldly experience in your mouth. Oh-- and the Chicken Tandoori. Oh my!  We've been here four times in the last six weeks since discovering it because we literally crave this awesome food. The waiter who serves us is always the same guy--very friendly and always eager to get whatever you need. The spices are amazing and a multi-dimensional experience. This must be a family-owned business... I just get that sense because there really seems to be a pride of ownership both with the food preparation / presentation as well as the service.  I simply don't think Indian food can get better than this! I used to think Thai food was my favorite... Not anymore!"}
{"text":"I would rate 3.5*. Visited this place on a sunny Sunday at noon. Ordered vegetable korma, palappam and a paratha.  palappam batter should have coconut milk in significant quantity but this wasn't the case here. No coconut flavor I could get, paratha was good.  Korma did not taste like the typical Indian korma, but had tikka masala base may be.   Overall a decent place for one time visit. I am a vegetarian and no idea on chicken / beef dishes."}
{"text":"Small place. Not the best I've ever had but good for the price. The portions are huge, great for sharing."}
{"text":"one of the best indian restaurants in Phoenix.. food tastes amazing.. service was excellent.. prices are not bad at all!!"}
{"text":"We love Curry Garden! Sobin always serves us, and he is fantastic. I would like to see the place be a little more updated, but the food and management is great!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in our neighborhood.  I have never been to India, but the Indian food here rivals Indian food I tasted in London, NY and San Francisco.  Most of the Indian place I tried in AZ just tasted salty, always felt short changed.  But this place you can definitely tasted the spices.  Isn't that why we all crave Indian food once in a while?  I appreciate that they take their time to make their dish perfect.  George, the owner has alwyas been a great host! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food here is Awesome!  I had the chicken tika masala. Delicious.  I got it to go and it was even better the next day!"}
{"text":"We just had their chicken tikka masala, palak paneer and naan. All were delicious! Happy we read the previous great reviews and gave it a try. The food was flavorful and Sobin was a gracious host who provided excellent, attentive service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best Curry Chicken I've had. A completely unassuming place, even to the point that I questioned trying it the first time. Now I stop in every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Good food, restaurant is very small , but that didn't really matter. I liked the food  and the service was ok. The reason for 3 stars is I truly felt like they were overpriced. I wasn't impressed with the menu prices , especially compared to other Indian restaurants.  May possibly do a take out in the future but not really sure.   Overall , the quality of the food was pretty good though"}
{"text":"Despite what the overly critical food snobs may say about this place, I've been coming here consistently for over 5 years now and have never had an issue with the high quality, home prepared lunch buffet. Consistent quality,  consistent good service and cheap! In and out for under $10. + Best Tandoori chicken I've found outside of India! And the butter chicken is the perfect naan mop-up!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I came to visit family in mesa from San Francisco and came across this GEM. Coming from a place with such a diversity in Indian food this place is Amazing. And service is great. I will definitely come back when I'm visiting...."}
{"text":"This place has the best authentic Indian food I've ever had! We ordered chicken biryani, lamb biryani, chicken tikka masala, garlic naan, and samosa. All were amazing and served hot and fresh. The service is fast and they're very friendly! I couldn't pick a favorite because all of the food was so delicious! A must try if you're looking for Indian food!!"}
{"text":"I'm very grateful to have a good Indian restaurant near my house.  They do some things very well (the food) but they do drop the ball consistently on others.  So why 5 stars?  Mostly for selfish reasons.  The truth is they probably deserve 3.5 stars, but I want them to stay busy and succeed because I can't bear the thought of losing them.  It's kind of a dysfunctional relationship.  They abuse me with slow spotty service but then I keep going back for the excellent food.  It's not uncommon to call around dinner time to place an order and you get a message machine.  I'm pretty sure there are some low cost telecom solutions out there that could fix this.  Add a couple lines and then pick up the phone and say, \"Please hold and we'll take your order in just a minute.\"  Basic stuff, but they don't get that.  One time I placed my order and they said it would be ready in half an hour, so I arrived on the spot and found my order hadn't been started.  Aaaaagh!  If I lived in New Deli I could just go to the place next door, but I live in Chandler so I have no choice but to return and even help promote them in hopes they up their service game.  If you love good Indian food, you should really go here.  And please be patient as they learn to deal with our pampered, needy, Western standards for customer service.  Just keep your eye on the prize, which is some of the best Indian cuisine you will find in the East Valley."}
{"text":"This is the only place where you can get Kerala food. They serve it during Sat and Sunday. The chef is very friendly and the food is really good. They have specialized Kerala foods like Appom, Fish curry, Kappa etc on weekends.   Great Taste."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday night. It was pretty dead. My friend and I were the only people eating in, but we saw a few people order their food to go. The restaurant is nice inside and very quiet.   The chicken tikka masala was very good, though a bit yellower and more curry-flavored than I've had -- so somewhat different from the traditional, but we liked it very much. The garlic naan is also delicious. Oddly they tried to get us to order two orders of garlic naan right off the bat, but we declined. One was more than enough for two people. The bowl of rice that comes with the order is pretty small, but it's good. Could definitely have used a second one of those. Ended up being $36 with tax and tip for two dishes and naan, which is a little high, but I'd probably still go back."}
{"text":"Wanted to hit up a new Indian food place and decided on the Curry Garden. At first glance, the inside is not exactly glamorous but again it's about the food right?  I ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala, Bhatura, and Garlic Naan. It was delicious! There was plenty of Paneer in the dish (deliciously fresh) and the sauce was great. The Bhatura was made very well, but make sure you eat it when it's hot (so good for dipping). The Garlic Naan was good as well, with a generous amount of Garlic.  All in all this place had great food and service, although the design inside was not great, it was clean.  Look forward to coming to this place again if I need my Paneer fix :)."}
{"text":"Service was iffy at first; it took time for them to sit us down or even greet us. However, once they eloped us it turned into a relatively friendly experience. The place was ok, I had seen pictures and it looked fancier on those. The food was really good, perfect seasoning and generous portions. Their naan bread was great. I'd definitely recommend it to friends and family."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here through Postmates and I am going to have to order here again soon! Their food was soooo good! Even my picky family members liked it!"}
{"text":"We tried Curry Garden for the first time tonight. The food was delicious and the service was awesome. We ordered naan, garlic naan, chutney, samosas, tandoori chicken and lamb vindaloo. The spices of the food were perfect. Our favorite dish was the lamb vindaloo. We ordered medium spice for that dish, because we shared that with our daughter. She absolutely loved the food as well. Everything tasted good. We will be coming here again."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Tikka Masala ever! Garlic Naan is delicious and the service is always friendly and prompt!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch because we were craving biryani and this place did not dissapoint! We ordered chicken and lamb biryani and loved them both. Very authentic and delicious!!! This is our new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm updating my review. They DO have Chicken Tika Masala, but for whatever reason they didn't have it in the buffet options when I went last week. So I ordered it online today for pick up, so I could eat by myself at work like a losery loser.  Oh Em Gee, delicious! The perfect blend of spice and butteryness. Great with the garlic naan.   I expected my co-workers to poke their heads into the breakroom to find out what that \"ethnic food smell\" was. I would have been like, \"here, eat this!\" No one did, they just walked by. Probably scared of the new girl with ethnic food.  Anywho, the Tika Masala was great, so I had to come back and give them that 5th star I promised. If this isn't a regular offering in their buffet, it should be.  I also ordered a soda to go too. This will be a regular on the work-lunch rotation. Maybe if I work nearby long enough, I can make a lunch buddy and convince them to come eat with me."}
{"text":"Good authentic food and service.  Might be a good idea for the owners to consider renovating inside.  But will definitely return for their good quality and quantity food."}
{"text":"Enjoyed coming here for the first time for a late lunch. Choose the buffet (very affordable lunch option) and the bread they brought out was amazing!   The owner was very nice and I enjoyed talking to him for a few minutes before leaving.  The only negative was the service was lacking. There was a drink at our table that didn't get refilled for over a half hour, but we had water to work with.   Not worth traveling a long distance, but if you live close, worth coming at the lunch buffet price (7.99)."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was delish.  We had tikki masala, chicken curry and palak paneer.  Next time we'll skip the chicken curry and double up on the masala - it was super yum.  I don't care for palak paneer in general - but this had a really nice deep rich spiced flavor.   Garlic Naan was very good - and the rice comes with the food (and extra for $.99 - not the $3-4 for rice some places charge).   They said the veggie korma came with brocolli - which I can't eat - so I didn't get to try one of my favorite things - time to find a new favorite thing!  Don't expect fancyness or great decor - but that's ok - delish food and the silly quirky new waitress made up for it."}
{"text":"After spending some time teaching Indian history of the 1840's, I was jonesing for all things naan and curry. The ambiance could really use some help. Plenty of space but doesn't feel clean, hardly any decorations, and not a place I would come with a group to hand out. Waiter wasn't 100% certain about the menu or Indian food. He needed to keep running to the back to ask the chef. I didn't have any tough questions - does this come with rice? Which dish is tomato based? I had forgotten the name. The buffet had very few options and the food looked like it had been out for awhile so we ordered off the menu. Food was pretty good so we left full but next time I may order take out. Garlic naan was delicious as was the chicken tikka masala but the shrimp tandoori was deep fried with the shell on and all veggies were super dry and burnt."}
{"text":"Came for their lunch buffet but should have walked out after looking at the scare offerings.  The one person working the floor was friendly.  Buffet Trays were somewhat empty with an already limited selection.  Food quality, from what there was, were kinda meh ...   Maybe their menu items are amazing.  Maybe ... but I won't be back to try my luck."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for the first time today for their lunch buffet on a recommendation from a friend. It was very good and it lived up to our expectations. The food was fresh and hot and I would definitely come here again.  The lunch buffet is good but I'm hoping to order off the menu next time I come and try something different."}
{"text":"This is the only Indian place I go to after I discovered Curry Gardens! They have the best and most authentic Kerala cuisine and we keep coming back for more! I prefer takeout but I've had good experiences dining in as well. The owners and staff are attentive and great at explaining the dishes."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The food was delicious and the service was great too. I recommend this place to anyone who wants authentic Indian food."}
{"text":"Damned tasty food, with only a few little complaints.  I ordered a few dishes for delivery tonight, and I was pleasantly surprised by how good they were. Ordered the 'mutton fry with bone' (not the best description) which was excellent- meat falling off of the bones (be careful though, as some of the bones are quite small!) in a very tasty curry sauce; the shrimp masala (such a delicious sauce, with great spice!), the chicken tikka kabob (REALLY good juicy chicken meat and fresh peppers), samosas and paneer naan (both tasty).  Everything was good, but not nearly spicy enough. I ordered everything 'spicy', but I think that next time I'll send a message asking for 'extra spicy' (maybe with an added message saying that I'm Mexican and can handle it...). I've got a cold right now that I'm trying to burn out of my sinuses, so I was hoping for some really good heavy spice that would send me into a flop sweat. I can understand them wanting to err on the conservative side, since I'm SURE they've gotten orders sent back by Gilbert whiteys because \"it was just too spicy!!\". But when someone checks the 'spicy' box, they need to get their buttholes ready because the food SHOULD be spicy! Just sayin'.  Everything was good and I'll order delivery from them again- I'll just make sure to notate that I want it extra spicy!!!"}
{"text":"***update, they are two for two in forgetting rice in my to go order!!! Good thing I checked both times!  Good food but they could improve customer service, they are almost like talking to robots. Nan was better this time.   Original post: Good but not great. I got it to go and initially they forgot to give me rice, luckily I noticed before I left the parking lot. The nan got old and rubbery by the time I started eating about 10-12 min after I left the restaurant. The chicken tikka masala was good and I'll probably go back and eat in to give the nan a chance again. Why is it so hard to find good Indian good in AZ?!?!?!"}
{"text":"I was amazed when I walked in that there were no other customers except for me. I had ordered food from this restaurant before through online delivery and home delivery. I knew their food was good and I was interested in trying their food at their restaurant location. They are very friendly here and they are very eager to help and they're very eager to earn your business. The food is excellent it deserves five stars. I give them four stars because for five stars everything has to be hitting on all cylinders. Things to note about this restaurant is that the dining room is not very large so it's pretty intimate. Their menu selection is excellent, and their bread choices are outstanding. Ask for assistance if you don't understand something because they recommend things that are quite delicious for you to eat. I think the only thing that I would change is I would make one of the bathrooms available to both men and women, and I would remodel the other bathroom. Then after that remodel I would make that the common bathroom for both men and women, and I would remodel the other bathroom. The updated bathrooms would really enhance the restaurant. But moreover you're coming here to eat a delicious meal and that's what you'll find when you eat here is delicious food. I highly recommend you try visiting the restaurant soon in your plans."}
{"text":"This place completely surprised me.  It's a total hole in the wall but the food was fantastic!  Owner/waiter was incredibly nice so service gets a 5 star!  Don't be turned off by the dreary interior order the lamb korma or curry both great, chicken curry was Devine and chicken tikka masala was beyond good.  Garlic naan was the best I have ever had!   Take the food to go if you don't like the location or hole in the wall status."}
{"text":"Based on reviews, was excited to try, but...... Most dishes tasted same. Same food as we experience in any other Indian restaurant. Not very happy with the prices and quantities.  Chicken tandoori was not tandoori, it was a grilled one. Karahi chicken is not like authentic punjabi style. Biryani is not even close to what we call authentic biryani. There are many other places to offer much better food at reasonable prices. Vegetarian dishes are way too expensive for the taste. NOT going back."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Forgot to update this after I ate my meal that day. I changed my rating from 2 to 4 stars just because their food was that delicious. Portions aren't the greatest but you can see my old review below."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place!  Small, friendly restaurant vibe.  Clean.  Food was solid.  Lamb Korma was delicious.  Samosa's were my favorite.  Pretty fast service for a party of 10. I deafly look forward to visiting here more often."}
{"text":"We got curry, chicken tikka masala, rice and garlic naan. The chicken tikka masala is absolutely phenomenal. The curry and rice were great, but I am in love with the masala. It was buttery, mildly sweet, and not too spicy. Perfection!"}
{"text":"First time. Ordered palak paneer and chicken tikka masala. Both were great. Tasty naan. Took a friend with high expectations of Indian food and she was very happy. A little pricey but good sized portions."}
{"text":"This place was overs all good.. The vindaloo could have been a little bit spicer for my taste but still delicious.. This place is a nice and cozy restaurant with good service.. The garlic nann was good and the appetizer vegetable samosa was good as well.. The only thing I have to say is that the water has little white water particles floating inside the water.. So order a soda or another drink.."}
{"text":"It's a tiny little place but the food is so so yumm ! Went there during the weekend and tried the Kerala menu . Kappa , beef fry , mutton fry , parota and chicken curry .. Yes that was our order and every single dish was delicious . I am a keralite and this felt like heaven to me . Kappa could have been a little warmer but whose complaining , the taste was amazing ! Parota and chicken curry is a must try ! Chuck the ambience and focus on their awesome food ."}
{"text":"Very excellent Indian food from southern India Kerala  food. Came here for a Birthday celebration and had the Tika masala, lamb curry, yellow Dahl and Garlic naan.  Service is great. Staff is friendly and helpful if it's your first time to India food. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty impressed with the Chicken Tikka Masala here! I've gotten it multiples times and it's always good. I'm picky about meat, the chicken in it is really good and not fatty or gristly. The samosas are delicious as well. I forced myself to branch out one time and got the chicken curry, it was pretty good but I didn't feel like it had as much flavor as the Tikka Masala. I would like to come try the buffet one day, but so far have only gotten take out. Definitely worth giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Found it on accident a couple months ago. I am super impressed with the attentive attitude of the entire staff to make the customer happy.   So far everything we've ordered is amazing and we'll keep going here!  Thanks"}
{"text":"Ordered Lamb Curry with  8/10 Spicy to go. waited a good 10-15 mins as what to be expected for lamb curry made from scratch. The taste? top notch very flavorful thick curry with chunks of meat. Def will come again for the Indian food craving."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Indian food and the worst service in town.  This is Indian food for white people I have no idea what Indian food is supposed to taste like.  There is no spices and no flavor whatsoever.  The buffet is not even worth the eight dollars they charge for it. They bring out the naan at the end of the meal. What is that about?  I asked for peppers or something to add some spice to the food and they did not have it. The tandoori chicken was tasting like it was yesterday's and was extremely dry and Burt. There is absolutely no reason for this buffet to the existing. Closet it down already!"}
{"text":"After you read this review you might wonder why I ate here.   My wife moved her napkin with silverware wrapped inside and an earwig ran from under the napkin across the table.  Yuck!  Her knife was dirty ugg!  Restaurant was dirty  Food was a 4-5 but wife said she would not go back"}
{"text":"Amazing food. I love their Kadai chicken. I recommend getting it spicy if you can handle spicy food. It's heavenly. No wonder they are called Curry Garden. The place is definitely run down and hole in the wall. I rarely see ppl dining inside... Hope they will stay afloat! Because their food and service is top notch."}
{"text":"Good food! We ordered parotta with vegetable koorma and chicken curry. One word - Amazing.   We also ordered chicken tikka kabob and it didn't disappoint either. Real spicy food lovers- you can go more than medium spicy. Would definitely go back again. Yummy in my tummy!!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I are in town for the weekend, and while visiting a friend, came across this restaurant on the way back to our hotel. We felt bad coming in so close to closing- the staff was so warm and friendly, and very accommodating. We ordered the chicken korma and lamb vindaloo... best we've had bar none. Our favorite normal place in Vegas is now a second favorite. Highly recommend this to anyone who wants a lil kick to their dish, and a warm, friendly dining experience. Definitely will return on our next trip here!!!"}
{"text":"Eating at the lunch buffet now.  Great food, friendly staff!  Great place for vegetarians.  On my first trip to the buffet, I filled my plate and without realizing none of it contained meat.  The prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Ordered online and picked up at the store. Location was easy to find with lots of available parking.   I ordered the chicken curry, but wished I had gotten something much spicier. Despite it lacking in intensity, it was the best chicken curry I've had so far. My roommate and I have agreed to come back here again and try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Best curry I have eaten since I can remember! Order it spicy people you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Please do not go here they charged us extra person for our 1 year old and i told him to refund it and he said no its for the mess he made so disrespectful and stupidest thing I've ever heard of . We will never return .. btw there is a way larger and better india buffet on Ray and Rural called india gate , must check it out the owners there are awesome"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and it was very good! I got the Paneer Tikka Masala with garlic naan and it tasted amazing. Very small establishment, but they were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I love places like this! Very authentic, amazing customer service! Definitely returning next time I'm in town! Chicken tikka Masala 10/10 Garlic naan 10/10 Food made to order but the little wait is so worth it"}
{"text":"Very fresh and tasty. We were pleasantly surprised at the taste and quality of the food at this unassuming locale. Thoroughly enjoyed the Samosa Chaat, Spinach Lamb and Chicken Tikka. Good sized portions. Good service."}
{"text":"Delicious.  That's the first word that comes to mind.  This is a tiny restaurant, very bright and decently decorated.  I think it has 10 tables top.  There was only one host/waiter around and he also kept disappearing int he kitchen for long periods of time, so he may have been cooking too.  A couple of folks came in to order food and had to wait several minutes for him to come out, but he was very attentive with us.  He asked us whether we liked every dish, told us the food was in the southern India style.  He even recommended dishes for the kids and got it right! The prices were appropriate.  We got some typical dishes (Tikka masala) but we also tried a chicken dish that was a house specialty, and it was amazing.  It was a chicken curry.  We'll definitely go back."}
