{"text":"We had a very friendly server who helped us order based on our tastes.  The food came out hot, quick, fresh, and was a generous portion. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"They have the most authentic Taiwanese (and some Chinese) food in Pittsburgh metro area. Their beef noodle soup is comparable to the one you can get from Chinatown, NYC! Other than various deliciously drooling entrees, their appetizers and soup selections are also go-die-for, highly recommending the marinated duck!"}
{"text":"Our first meal there tonight. Wonderful service great food and a very pleasing ambience. We love the convenience of so many outstanding food choices right in our own backyard. Our waiter Patrick was right on the ball and helped us navigate the menu. A familiar face greeted us upon our arrival--- from another Asian restaurant on the Avenue that we also enjoy--. The new owner Jennie came and inquired several times as to our experience. Her enthusiasm is contagious and made us feel right at home. The couple seated to my right (from China) had been to Cafe 33 three times since it opened just two weeks ago on September 6th.    Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Great food! Loved the vegetarian options. The staff was very helpful in helping me pick dishes without meat or eggs. The mango milk bubble tea was also really good."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The staff is very friendly. The food is also good and not expensive."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this restaurant is super cute and the patio is really nice. Parking can be hard. The food was just okay though. I thought the reviews overhyped the place. The owner I believe it was waited on us and she was very sarcastic and had a dry sense of humor. It was nice. But the food I wouldn't go of of my way for. I wish the Asian food in this area was better."}
{"text":"Food poisoning right after having intestine with spicy sauce this Wednesday. This never happens to some other places close by. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is essentially the Rose Tea Cafe that I knew and loved 5 years ago (as the food quality and service there has been steadily declining). This Rose Tea devotee has been converted. The waiter was extremely accommodating when we asked if we were might be able to have our dog with us at the outside table-- he even brought him a bowl of water! Food is A+, the people are lovely. Will be back many more times!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food, especially liked the eggplant and basil, and the xiao long bao were quite good and held their juice.  Not too long of a wait at 7:30 on a Wednesday night, perhaps 5 minutes."}
{"text":"I had the chance to dine at Cafe 33 on its opening day and it was a delight! My friend and I tried several appetizers/dishes and they were all quite flavorful. The chefs here use a unique blend of spices that I have not encountered elsewhere. The basil chicken was a highlight, but everything we ordered was great. The people working there are super nice as well. I'm looking forward to returning to try more of this Taiwanese cuisine!"}
{"text":"Service was great and food was great!  We had Fish Fillet w/basil in Casserole (???), Dry Sautéed  Chicken w/Dried Pepper (????)?Sautéed Seasonal Veggie(???)?Stir fried Beef Tripe (?????), and Smelly Crispy Bean Curd (???)?It was full at 6pm on a Saturday.  We decided to take their offer and seated outside (other groups did too).  It got a little chilly at the end and food got cold much fast except the casserole one.  Food came up real fast and tasted delicious.  Our waiter was very attentive and checked on us multiple times.  Highly recommend the Dry Sautéed  Chicken w/Dried Pepper!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here four times- everything  from Bubble tea to Taiwanese sticky rice. My favorite was Shrimp with Tofu and I am not a big tofu fan.  But- the tofu was silken and the flavor of the white sauce was quietly extraordinary . My other was Salt and Pepper Shrimp"}
{"text":"I don't often write restaurant reviews, but Cafe 33 definitely deserves a good one! My boyfriend and I stopped in for a late lunch on a weekday afternoon. We ordered the soup dumplings to start. Our waiter was very friendly and took the time to show us the correct method of eating them since they can be tricky, which I thought was nice. It was indicative of the high quality of service we received throughout the meal. For entrees, we chose the Pan Fried Noodles with Chicken and the Kim Chi & Pork Hot Pot. Both were so so SO good and the portion sizes were generous. Needless to say, we are already talking about when we will be returning!"}
{"text":"Just a note: Cafe' 33 is _not_ a \"Chinese\" restaurant. It is a Taiwanese restaurant that is fully authentic - this proclamation I have on the best kind of authority. I am only partially through the menu, but thus far everything is tasty and at a great price. You will find no better Taiwanese Restaurant in Pittsburgh (and likely for a good ways around). I am hoping that Cafe' 33 will stick to its guns in educating its customers on the fine art of vegetable cooking. Their vegetables are the trademark of excellence in Taiwanese cooking - Americans generally, (and Pittsburghers specifically), now have their best opportunity to see what expertly cooked vegetables look and taste like :). What good fortune for our city!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Taiwanese restaurant in Pittsburgh. The crispy pork chop noodle soup is finely made and served.  Some special dishes are not on the menu so don't forget to ask for recommendations on the whiteboard."}
{"text":"Great food, big portions. I got 3 meals out of a dinner here. It was such a good price, considering how much food it was and also how tasty. Waitress was always on the ball with refilling water, which is something I always notice because I drink a ton."}
{"text":"Service is extremely kind and friendly.   I don't think I have ever received food as fast as I did here- an incredible 5 minutes for EVERYTHING.   We got: -scallion pancake with egg interesting, not too eggy, but not like a scallion pancake. Worth a try! -house fried noodles no pork the fried noodles were amazing! Packed with flavor, some crispy, some not, the shrimp were perfect. Normally they are left too crisp at other establishments. -duck yolk shrimp The highlight of the evening- crispy outside with a creamy inside. AMAZING. It is not on the menu.  -eggplant with garlic sauce very soft, flavorful, delicious!  Prices were relatively great, though some items were loads more expensive than others. However, the flavor is unmatched. I would definitely go here again when given the chance."}
{"text":"\"The interior says it's a 5-star restaurant. The food says worse then a cheap buffet.\"  Had high hopes for this place but our food was underwhelming. Seafood tasted like it was out of a frozen bag, the noodles were dropping with literal grease. I've had better food out of frozen TV dinners. Very disappointing. The search for quality Chinese food continues.  Edit: here I am, a few hours later, and I think I have food poisoning. Down to 1 star."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh! Attentive staff and great food. It can get busy during the weekends but it is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"One of the good authentic Chinese/Taiwanese restaurants in town. The place can get a bit crowded during peak hours, but it is fast and efficient! You get your seats and food equally fast, without compromising the quality. Favorite dish is ??? ?look for Chinese characters on the menu, ha)."}
{"text":"I ordered the fried stinky tofu thinking that was just the name but quick to realize I had mistaken. The service is not great and the stinky tofu is absolutely repulsive. After I told them I could not eat it they said they can't do anything about it and still charged me. Also the Kung Pao chicken had FAR too many red peppers. Would not go again"}
{"text":"You would think, \"Another Asian restaurant in the very Jewish Squirrel hill?\" But seriously, it's a great venue, awesome staff, friendly, and the food is delish, and at a great price. If you want the American-Style Asian food, at fast food prices, you only need to look down the street. I have now been three times, which is a lot of repeat for me. Can I name all the dishes? no, lol. I loved the Lotus wrapped sticky rice, the dumplings, one called \"Sha gahn Lau Stui???\".. I loved the mushroom dish I had, which beats my sister-in-laws, who has this legendary mushroom dish, and picks her own wild mushrooms from the woody hills by her farm. These guys must have good vendors, and they add love.  From what I can tell, is a specialized Chinese cuisine, from the island of Tiwan, lots of vegetarian dishes that my wife has loved, and mind you, it will take us a while to discover all the dishes... but I even dared their Tripe, (I think that is how stomach is spelled). It was more of a dare, since I haven't liked it in the past, but I really enjoyed it!  Clean bathrooms, a patio to sit at, classic features like a water fountain, and lots of space for a small reataurant.  I heard people compare it to Rose Tea Cafe, and I remember those guys vastly improving a few years ago, and as it turns out, it is this Cafe 33 chef that was the reason. I am happy he has his own place. You'll love the food, so worth the moderate price, and the staff is great.  I know the place is new, but I can tell it's going to be an East End Icon!"}
{"text":"Often crowded and for good reason. I have had such good food here! My favorite is to get the pork soup dumplings and the eggplant. The soup dumplings are not quite as good as Everyday Noodle around the corner, but they still are very good and the other dishes are just great too. I've had a couple of chicken dishes that I've been very pleased with, and a friend of mine had a tofu dish that was great. The only drawback is that it's so busy that you have to leave as soon as you've finished eating--doesn't feel very hospitable. But if you don't have time to stay and chat anyway, this is a good place to choose."}
{"text":"Well, as a Chinese, this is the best Chinese restaurant near CMU when you don't want something really oily and spicy. NOT American Chinese food.  ??? is really good, and also ??? - their popular dishes. But the drawback is, the place is too small and has too little space between desks. And sometimes they hurry you into ordering... But the food is really good!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing!  The dumplings are an A!  We had the spicy fish in hot pot that blew our minds.  Also, the Taiwanese cabbage was sublime.  The food and service are some of the best we have had in any city.  Pittsburgh is lucky to have this gem."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom. It was both of our first times.  Atmosphere: Never noticed this place before given it's kind of hidden and tucked behind Starbucks. But it's cute, cosy, and casual.   Service: Water came quickly as well as our food. Waiter asked us if peanuts on the Gua Bao were okay in case we had allergies. We don't, but it was nice that he asked anyway. I've never had that experience at a restaurant before. Waiter was overall very prompt and friendly. He didn't check on us much but the place was packed so we didn't mind.   Food:   Steamed Dumplings: I had one and I wasn't a huge fan, but my mom loved them. She said they were flavorful and fresh and not greasy at all.  Mini Pork Soup Dumplings: I love soup dumplings and I was curious to see how they compared to other soup dumplings I had enjoyed in the area (right down the street are Everyday Noodle and Sun Penang which both have excellent soup dumplings). These were pretty good, although they weren't as plump with soup as I'm used to, and there wasn't much meat either. The flavor was excellent though and I would still recommend them.   Gua Bao (Pork Bun): The vegetables were really fresh and crisp and the meat was flavorful. You get one bun but it's big enough to share. It's a bit of a messy eat, and I wished I had some more pork and less veggie, but I would still recommend.  Mixed Seafood Over Rice: My mom ordered this. She thought that sauce was flavorful, not too oily or heavy, and the vegetables were (once again) very fresh. She also enjoyed that they give you a healthy portion of seafood.   Minced Braised Pork Over Rice: This is another favorite of mine over at Everyday Noodle. Once again the flavors were good, but I was disappointed with the lack of meat. About  of the bowl consisted of kimchi and the same pickled veggies mixture that came on the pork bun. I didn't really want all of that. I would prefer more pork to go with the Rice.   Overall: Very tasty food with excellent service. I will definitely be back to try more apps and some of the other dishes. Will definitely be recommending this place to others.   Score: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Very authentic Taiwanese food. We had three cup chicken and bamboo shoots with pork. The dishes were very flavourful, but not over-powerful. It is a good balance of the original taste of the food and spice. Portions wise was not too large. Good service and good environment. Overall a very good four star restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Taiwanese food!! I like this one so much better than Rose tea now. Will come back and recommend to friends"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving AUTHENTIC Taiwanese food, I gravitate towards Cafe 33! This place is honestly unbeatable.  THE FOOD is amazing. The ingredients are always fresh, the food is definitely made with care and the portions are perfect. The plating is much appreciated too. Everything tastes as good as it looks, if not better! And the craziest part, the speed at which everything comes out. Don't know how they do it!  THE BUBBLE TEA is pretty good! If you're craving some boba, definitely try their Green Milk Tea! It's my favorite one!  THE SERVICE is always so kind, thoughtful and efficient. I've gone plenty of times, and never once did I have a negative experience. They know how to treat customers with respect and warmth. They also definitely know their food as well!  THE INTERIOR is clean and definitely aesthetically pleasing! Plenty of seating and CLEAN RESTROOMS!  My only complaint? It tends to be busy but that only goes to show how great this place really is!  I'd recommend you go with a bigger group and go family style! That way you can try the most food while paying a reasonable amount. The eggplant dish is my go to!"}
{"text":"I wanted to dig it BUT better options abound in Squirrel Hill  Went for lunch with BF as was hopeful to try a new Asian option in Squirrel Hill but I was not thrilled with my choices while there. I had only OK cucumber salad (felt it was too salty) and steamed dumplings we gummy. Green beans were salty as well. Tofu dishes here were great though.  I hate to say it but I have several other \"go to\" Asian places in SQ that I would return to prior than Bistro Cafe 33  I might be willing to give it a second try but competition is stiff in this neck of the woods"}
{"text":"I'm Taiwanese and I love this new addition to the Squirrel Hill area! I brought my other Taiwanese friend on my first visit and immediately it was like going back to Taiwan. The service was on point, and our server was so enthusiastic! We ordered all the things that are naturally most Taiwanese and generally not found in other restaurants nearby (gua bao, scallion pancake with beef, pork intestines hot pot, golden duck yolk pork) to judge the authenticity and quality of food. We were both so happy with everything, from authenticity of all the foods, to crispness of the scallion pancake with beef, the perfect ratio of duck yolk to meat, etc. The price point is comparative to the prices of all neighboring Asian restaurants like Rose Tea Cafe and Everyday Noodle, but the food is 10x better! I used to go to Everyday Noodle all the time before I noticed a decreasing quality of their noodles (I will give that I go during busy hours)... and was ready for a new Taiwanese restaurant around the area. I left with an extremely happy stomach and knowing I would be coming back.  Since my first time in September, I have come back on many occasions (practically every other week), bringing different friends each time and recommending my other friends to go try it out! I have tried so much on their menu now, and while I can attest that their other foods selection are terrific as well (zong zi aka glutinous sticky rice, beef noodle soup, and mapo tofu hot pot are really good options too), if it is your first time going, I would definitely recommend ordering the foods I got my first time. That's why you go to a Taiwanese restaurant as opposed to another, right?  One thing I do regretfully have to say is to steer clear of is their bubble teas (or boba if you're Taiwanese like me!) and their soup dumplings (xiao long bao) though. If you want quality bubble tea, I'd say still go to Fuku Tea and order their loose leaf options. If you want soup dumplings, I'd still pop in Everyday Noodle since they handmake theirs on the spot. For every other menu item though, I'd say give Cafe 33 a chance and you won't be disappointed! (Did I say to get gua bao yet?)"}
{"text":"Came here after having drinks at Hidden Harbor across the street. There were 3 of us so we were seated at a table for 6 with 3 strangers. It actually wasn't bad though and didn't interfere with our meal. I got the mini soup buns, garlic cucumber salad and pork belly bun. The food arrived quickly and was very good. The menu is extensive so I can't wait to come back and try something different."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. The service is fast, the food is really good. We tried HOT PEPPER CHICKEN & MINCED BRAISED PORK OVER RICE. They were both delicious. We will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"The people at the restaurant were extremely nice. The clientele was almost exclusively Asian, which leads one to believe that the food is authentic. However to my taste it was only fair. I will go back to try a few more dishes."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Only downside is no parking lot so you'll have to drive around this busy area for street parking. We had the stinky tofu, pig blood hotpot (??), and twice cooked pork. All were delicious and completely satisfied my cravings.  The stinky tofu was a little bigger than what I imagined, but just as delicious. And the Taiwanese style kimchi was very refreshing paired with the fried tofu. The pig blood hotpot was a good sized portion and full of sour cabbages, pig blood, and intestine (sounds nasty but I promise so good). The twice cooked pork, curiously, comprised of bacon like meat instead of a thicker cut meat that I remember this dish should be made of. But nevertheless very good!  All in all a great meal!"}
{"text":"Seven us went here for dinner on a Saturday night.  It was crowded and seemed like the place to go for dinner in Squirrel Hill.  They seemed to have forgotten our reservation, because the staff seemed to freak out when our group started to showed up.  They were able to seat us when we were all there, but it was a tight squeeze at our table.  Besides that initial confusion with our reservation, everything was amazing.  The food was fantastic.  Us veggies had the turnip cake as an appetizer, it's a solid appetizer choice that I'll be getting the next time I'm there.  There were four vegetarians in our group and we ordered family style, so I got to try the sauteed vegetables, the eggplant with garlic, the kimchi hot pot, and the Mapo tofu.  The sauteed vegetables and the eggplant with garlic were my favorite dishes.  The next time I have a craving for Taiwanese (which is surprisingly often), I'll be coming here."}
{"text":"We usually get take out and have eaten at the restaurant once. We easily got seated around 5 but by 5:30 the place was packed.  Definitely one of our favorite places for awesome, modestly priced authentic meals. Chicken and string beans is a family favorite as is the eggplant with basil. One of our friends was an \"I only eat chicken and broccoli\" so they accommodated and made that for her. Waiter was really helpful answering questions and making recommendations."}
{"text":"Wonderful and engaging service with excellent food!  I wish that I didn't have to crow about this restaurant because YOU will find it and make it difficult for ME to get a table.  But, I have to crow about it!  We enjoyed the vegetable and wonton soup which was enough for three people.  The vegetables were crispy, the wontons were very delicate and quite good, and the broth was perfect - not too salty and not watery.  The mini pork soup buns are really good.  They are not as good as Everyday Noodles, but they are not to be passed up - because they are quite tasty.  The pan fried dumplings were lightly fried and very delicate.  My husband had the beef over Chinese watercress - the greens were perfectly al dente, the beef was tender and very lean.  My daughter and I had the stir fried rice cakes with tofu and chicken.  The rice cakes were appropriately chewy and the veggies were fresh, crisp and delicious.  The sauce was bit oilier than I would have liked, but the taste was so good that I was able to finish the whole plate.    Cafe 33 has only been open since September!  To have things together this quickly is quite a feat.  I am looking forward to having this wonderful Taiwanese restaurant in Squirrel Hill for years to come."}
{"text":"The manager asked us to leave our table and wait outside the restaurant when we have ordered just 3 bubble tea, a fried rice and a small dish. There was no one waiting for the tables. Ridiculous! I wont visit this store again."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh. I like the food very much, such as the shrimp and fried rice cake, and the bubble tea here is also very good. They offer very good service as well. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Best vegetable spring rolls I have EVER had. Served with a spicy sauce, they were delicious. I had the fish w/ basil in a clay pot, and my boyfriend had fried pork cutlets over rice. Everything came out quickly and sizzling hot. Our server was kind and attentive as well. Even the drinks! We ordered a small pot of tea and it was light, soothing, and hot. Perfect end to a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Lively place with really good grub - I'm so happy to have found a place in Pittsburgh that serves real xiao long baos, and happily burnt my tongue on these.   Service here alternated between very informal and cordial, but the food was consistently pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Always very busy. The soup dumplings are superior. Anything in a crock!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I honestly had no idea what to order and how the experience was, especially because it was about a year ago. But I recently came for the second time for dinner on a Sunday and I was really satisfied. I don't have many experiences with authentic Chinese food so this might be one of the best I've had so far.   The menu is pretty extensive so do your research or come with people who are familiar with Chinese dishes so you get the best food experience here:) We ordered the mapo tofu, stir fry rice cakes with beef, and the mala spicy chicken. My favorite dish of the three was the mala spicy chicken. It's like deep fried breaded popcorn chicken with Chinese red peppers that added a kick of spice (not extremely spicy but just right).   The only issue I would say is that because Cafe 33 is such a popular restaurant, it can get crowded and loud. The space isn't as big for its need. This might be the reason why I didn't come as often in the past... just was never sure if there would be seating available. As for the service, our waitress and the other servers was super friendly and accommodating.   Can't wait to try out more dishes here!!"}
{"text":"My friends all seem to love this place and recommended that I try it. So after being hyped up, I decided to take my parents there. Honestly, I was very disappointed. The food is average but authentic. Their soup dumplings are definitely the best in terms of what we ordered. The place was very small and crowded, and we were placed at a tiny table in front of the door to their kitchen. Sitting there felt really cramped and uncomfortable. What disappoint the most was their terrible service. I felt like our party was forgotten. We waited over half an hour to get our order, and no one stopped by to pour water. It was very challenging to ask for a server.   After eating there, my parents felt bad for me because this is the \"best\" Chinese foods in pgh."}
{"text":"Sure, the food's pretty good here, but not the service!  My girlfriend and I were asked to leave because they \"needed the tables.\"  This after she was given a bubble tea in a to-go cup instead of the frosted mug other patrons got.  I didn't realize till the female employee asked us to leave and ran off that they had apparently wanted to give away our small, two person table the entire time.  We weren't loitering or anything either,  she had ordered her bubble tea that they failed to include with our dinner and were there while she finished it, this happened immediately after paying the bill.  We, and several people we know, are never eating here again.  It's rare I encounter such rude service as this.  Several others seated next to us also said the service was bad."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Chinese restaurant I had in Pittsburgh. Unlike many Chinese restaurants that offer Americanized/westernized food, the food here is authentic and very close to what I had back home. The ambience is cozy and relaxing. A great find in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I could definitely say this is one of the most authentic Taiwanese cuisine in Pittsburgh! I love the fried chicken thigh rice and fried stinky tofu. As s student from Taiwan, it is a great place for me to have some good Taiwanese food!!"}
{"text":"We were just in town for concert but very glad we stopped by this place for dinner! Excellent service, very friendly staff and super yummy food with reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Pretty authentic Taiwanese food. We've been here many times and most of the dishes we tried were tasty. Stinky tofu is good, not as stinky as the ones in Taiwan but the way they fry the tofu makes the texture similar to Taiwanese stinky tofu (crispy on the outside and soft and juicy in the inside). Xiao Long Bao is also pretty nice, which I didn't expect. The owners were also very friendly.  There is one dish probably not authentic, which is the Intestine with sour cabbage. But the owner was good to remake a new one based on our description for us."}
{"text":"Great place! I loved their food. Pricy but worth it. The owner are from Taiwan China too. The only problem I had was that it was a little hard to park on the weekend. The restaurant does not have a parking lot, and the lot next to it is private. We had to park up the hill and walk a little bit to get to the place. After all, it was worth it! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"With a plethora of good Chinese/Malay/Thai restaurants in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, one would not have thought that another restaurant of that \"genre\" could carve out the niche that Cafe 33 has done in the short time it's been in existence. But it has.  The space used to be an urban laundromat & never boasted any good parking. The restaurant owners have done a good job of converting the small space into a restaurant.  The food is very different from what I'd expected. The flavors are light and refreshingly different from your standard Main Street Chinese restaurants. My favorite is their water cress which is sautéed with a hint of garlic and which I can have with plain steamed rice. Other dishes that I've liked include their sweet & sour pork and shrimp. Their marinated mushroom appetizer is another memorable dish.  All in all it has the feel of one of those hole-in-the-wall places in NYC where you (quite unexpectedly) find amazing cuisine."}
{"text":"This is such a great addition to Squirrel Hill. I think it is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the city! The place itself is small but I was quite surprised how many people frequent the restaurant. The servers are VERY friendly and service is excellent! Although in pictures there are tables set up on both sides of the restaurant, it doesn't stop them from accommodating more customers. They set up tables right in the middle. People don't seem to mind it because this place is that GOOD!   The food is excellent! I like the variety of food they offer from chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, veggies, soup, noodles, dumplings, and much much more! Whenever I'm craving Chinese food, I come here. You know this place is good when all you see are Asians. Sorry no pictures yet. My dishes smelled and looked so delicious, I didn't have a chance to snap a picture.   Other than the delicious food and excellent service, they make you feel welcomed and in my opinion that is the most important thing!!"}
{"text":"This place often seems busy, and it only takes one dine in experience to see why.   The service is good, the food is good, but it's fairly expensive. Their boba tea is better than rose cafe. (Everything about this place is better than Rose Cafe which is a short distance away)  My friends and I  lose our minds for the soup dumplings you get here.  You put them in your mouth after they cool off from being fresh out the kitchen and it's like literally eating flavorful little soup bomb water balloons of deliciousness. So fun to eat!  Also, the jellyfish celery salad is even better than I could have hoped. The texture was chewy but had a crunch, and was savory.  I could have eaten a full entree of that, rather than just an appetizer.   They're pretty okay for take out, though we've had them forget items when we've done this instead of eating in. Go with a group so you can share different entrees and try ALL THE THINGS!  I gave 3 stars because my issue is that the host at the front stared at us after we finished eating, and so we felt kinda rushed out.  Also, the server doubted my choice of order, because I wanted to try the jellyfish, but he seemed to want to steer me away from it-- not sure why. I have a feeling it was because he judged me by my looks and thought maybe I wouldn't like the texture?  It remains a mystery."}
{"text":"Worst Asian food in Pittsburgh. No idea how this has such a high rating. Literally everything we had was awful to the point that we left it. Short ribs were all fat, salt pork was all bones, fried rice was like bad oatmeal. I would not here if you paid me. Stay away. Maybe you need to be from Taiwan to understand why food is so bad. This place straight sucks."}
{"text":"Super delicious! We tried the vegetable spring roll and the pork belly bao bun, both amazing. We tried the Chicken with basil and Beef with black bean sauce and both were very good, but the beef had a special kick. Super busy on a Saturday night but we didn't wait too long. Very efficient and friendly service. We will definitely go back, especially because we can walk there."}
{"text":"Food is good. Our server was rude, which ruined the whole experience. Too me, it doesn't matter how good food is when a server is rude. Even if food is just okay, when a server is great, I have a good experience."}
{"text":"The service is horrible! The waiter starts trying to collect the dishes when it's almost done and most of the dishes taste not quite authentic.   On our last visit, we met friends there when we picked up our takeout order and started chatting at the table. About 5 minutes later (we were about to leave actually) the waitress asked us to move because she wanted to seat a customer right next to where we stood while the restaurant was 90% empty."}
{"text":"I ordered the cafe 33 thick noodle soup. It was not as flavorful as I had hoped it to be. I asked the waiter the most popular noodle soup and he recommended this to me. Personally, I would not order this dish again. My boyfriend ordered the pan fried noodles which was good, but that is all I would say about it. The waiter was very nice and patient as I asked him questions about the menu. I hope to try other dishes on the menu as Taiwanese cuisine is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Wow. I was floored by their cold appetizer dishes. Simple, tasty, and satisfying. We tried: jellyfish w/ celery salad, braised firm tofu, mala spicy beef tendon, marinated seaweed. Nom nom nom...taiwanese style sticky rice too although that isn't a cold appetizer. Also tried the salt & pepper squid which was perfectly spiced, lightly floured and fried, and very tender.   I think their cold dishes are really special - better than everywhere else I've tried and as at least as good as you can get in Taiwan!"}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite Taiwanese restaurant before, but not anymore! The foods there are good and the staffs are nice. However, the boss lady there is just rude and mean. My friends and I wanted to find a place to have bubble teas and have a seat for a while in Squirrelhill so we went to cafe 33. We felt sorry if we only ordered bubble tea so we ordered an appetizer and an entree to-go(total is $32 for 3ppl before tips). We've waited a long time for the food and drinks. While we were waiting, the boss lady came to ask us wait outside?! We have no idea why she asked to wait outside. I don't think this restaurant has a minimum charge and there was no one waiting for the table at the meantime. Maybe people who spend less than $10 are not welcomed during rush hour."}
{"text":"Me and my husband been going to the same Asian food place in Sq Hill for a years. Then Cafe33 opened and now every week we going to this place since it's opened. We had tried many different dishes. They have really good food! Our favorite is Fish w/ Pickled mustard Soup. Big bowl enough for two to share and it's just $6,95! And if you love kimchi,  try Kim Chi Stir Fried w/chicken, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Everything about Cafe 33 is great. Service, timing for take out, take out packaging, cleanliness, location (free street parking is usually available off of Shady Ave or other side streets), and most importantly, their food.  Cafe 33 is definitely my *favorite* neighborhood takeout place. I have probably ordered take out from them at least 20 times and eaten at the actual restaurant on a dozen other occasions.   Their food is consistently good. I abandoned my old neighborhood take out in favor of Cafe 33s unchanging menu and service. My favorite entree is the dry sautéed string beans and it remains the same whether I order it in the restaurant or have it for take out. I've also had their rice cake entree and multiple different side dishes that were all equally delicious.   I have also not tried the hot pepper chicken, but have heard that it is worth getting if you eat chicken (I don't) and like food with a nice kick."}
{"text":"Very tasty?Perfect Taiwan style?????Everything is fresh?We like it?Especially ????????????We will return for sure?"}
{"text":"Great choice for Chinese food in Pittsburgh. Located right in the heart of Squirrel Hill. The waiter offers helpful suggestions based on what is fresh. We went with what he recommended and were not disappointed. We had snow pea leaves with garlic, ma-po tofu and an egg crepe plus tea. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff. It can be pretty busy so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Super crowded local Chinese food spot is worth a visit. The various soups (I tried four of them to the tune of 8 bowls total) and fried rolls were delicious, as was the short rib (recommended by our server). The Kim chi was also tasty. The kung paos were based in meats that first were fried, which was not great. Great service and family atmosphere. Would *definitely* return. Ten of us ate well!"}
{"text":"Price is pretty decent - but the place can get packed!  The space is nicely designed though, and it feels very clean.  I thought the food was good but I think my experience was clouded by our table in the middle of the floor and constantly being bumped by the staff who would rearrange our table constantly just to have it rearranged by someone else.  I would go again but probably request a table against a wall.  I tried the Lo Mein noodles with chicken; next time I'm excited to try something else!  I would suggest the dumplings they were realllllyyyy good!  Additionally, the employees were super nice :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is more affordable and cheaper than any of the other Taiwanese restaurant in Pittsburgh. I honestly love everything about their menu and anything I order has been pretty great. One thing I cannot eat is there stinky tofu but my friend loved it. I just can't handle stinky tofu. But I love their tendon and their chow mein"}
{"text":"I rarely edit a review for the worse, but my second time here was significantly less impressive than my first. The stinky tofu was better, but both the beef noodle soup and the jellyfish appetizer (which was more vegetables than jellyfish) were especially bland. The stir-fried rice cakes and short ribs are good. The soup dumplings were unbelievably small this time and had no soup in them, so you'd be better off going to Everyday Noodles. The portions were small for the prices and the hostess was extremely rude! We asked to switch tables because the light was out above ours and my mother has poor vision, and she became immediately annoyed with us even though they weren't busy. Our waitress was friendly, however."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go here despite heavy rain that evening, and the effort wasn't a waste. When you seek to explore new cuisine, you want two things: (1) the food is good, and (2) there is staff in the restaurant that help you choose the right items. For this place, not only these two were satisfied, but also the guy helped us how to eat some of the items. For example, the soup dumpling - one should put it in the soup spoon to avoid wasting any of the soup. Amazing! We'll be back, we did try the shrimp and lobster sauce over rice and the  fried chicken over rice apart from the soup dumpling - but this is only our first time. Highly recommended! Five stars."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. The food here is very good, especially when legit Asian food is so hard to find in Pittsburgh. Most of the customers who dropped my the place were Asians, so that really speaks quite highly of Cafe 33 itself, too.  A group of us (6 people) stopped by for a late lunch on a weekday, and from what I heard, we were pretty lucky to arrive when they aren't so busy with lunch/dinner crowds (I heard the lines are typically out the door and you probably have to wait if you arrive during a normal lunch/dinner rush).  We ordered a bunch of dishes to share and got our own rice to eat as well. Not sure of all the actual names of the dishes on the menu, but we got marinated extra firm tofu (super yummy!), stinky tofu, xiao long bao, veggie with tribes, panfried shrimp omelette, watercress veggie, kang pao chicken and slice chicken with veggie!  And I'm happy to report that all the dishes were really good! To the fact that I mentioned to my SO that it was hard for me to believe that I was eating this in Pittsburgh!  Overall, the prices were reasonable at around $8-12 pre dish. We paid around $105 including tax and gratuity...not bad at all..and we were full! Service was great, too. Highly recommended especially if you have been longing for authentic Taiwanese food in the area."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place for lunch and dinner. The xiao long bao ( small soup dumpling) is pretty good with thin skin and soup in the center. Yum yum. The size of the dishes are smaller than I m used to compared to new York city. But overall, I like they place."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good (a tad pricey).  Usually trek to squirrel hill just to get Vietnamese down the road...but resisted the urge, and so glad we did! We had salt and pepper squid (just a tad too salty), beef pancake, beef soup --and demolish it we did."}
{"text":"Loved it! But more importantly my Taiwanese and Malaysian friend said it was authentic!"}
{"text":"I went here when they first opened up a while back. Back then, their food was a little bland to my tastes, (some seafood dish and clay pot). It's better now, so to those who've \"crossed out\" this place, reconsider going back!  I went back recently and got some takeout as I was seriously craving pork buns. The pork bun ($7) was good, but could've had a little more cilantro or peanuts though. I may prefer everyday noodles for buns.   I also got pig ear and tripe. The tripe was deliciouuuuus. A little on the pricier side ($8 for that tiny plastic pack), but they make it in house and it tastes like home. The pig ear was great too. It was sliced to a perfect thinness.   I know, its hard to judge service via takeout... but I do anyway. The lady in front was really sweet and accommodating. She helped me pick out the side dishes/appetizers too, so for a service standpoint - 10/10.  tldr; foods improved, generally average to above average food, sweet staff, would go back"}
{"text":"Friendly and helpful staff, good food - nice outdoor seating which is hard to find in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Pittsburgh!! Loved the fried dumplings, pork intestine noodles! Super spicy but awesome!! Beef tendons is a must for apps!!"}
{"text":"You that kind of delicious food, made with fresh vegetables and feels like to be healthy? Everything we ordered was good so far. Servers were nice and friendly. I recommend eggplant with shrimps, soup dumpling (\"shorompo\"), chinese vegetables  and vegetables sautéed with."}
{"text":"The food was good, service was okay. The dishes tasted authentic to me. My favorite was the spicy tendons. Really tasty but not smothered in sauce or overly salty. Would go back there for that alone."}
{"text":"Probably now one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the 'burgh, even though it's only been open for a couple months. The offerings here are pretty solid and they have a wide selection of Chinese/Taiwanese food to cater to all tastes. I especially like their Beef Noodle Soup. There's just a sweet spot to it, the soup itself isn't too salty/over-flavored, and the noodle consistency is just perfect for the soup itself. Scallion pancakes here are also pretty solid (egg or beef - I prefer the latter). Taiwanese Three Chunk Chicken here is alright, I prefer the one served at Rose Tea Cafe (the one in Squirrel Hill right around the corner) since it's not as salty. Bubble tea here is mediocre. Though the bubbles are okay, the flavor and consistency of the bubble tea just isn't there quite yet (I prefer either Banh Mi & Ti (!!) or Fuku). Would suggest that you come to try this place at least once."}
{"text":"This is the best Taiwanese restaurant in Pittsburgh. We had the sticky rice, gua bao, Taiwanese pork buns, marinated cabbage, and they even made salty pepper chicken for us, which was off menu. The food was great, the standouts being the gua bao and pork buns. The service was really good as well."}
{"text":"I make sure to always come here when I am in Pittsburgh. It has the some of the best Chinese/ Taiwanese dishes I have ever had.   The restaurant is an okay size on the inside, but it could get very crowded. The first time I came here for dinner, it was crowded and we had to share a large round table with other guests. The most recent time I came was for lunch, and it was not crowded at all. The restaurant has outside seatings. On a nice Pittsburgh day, these seats are ideal.   I have had the soup dumplings, Singapore noodles and sautéed string beans here. The soup dumplings were delicious, and very comparable to those I have had in NYC Chinatown. The only thing I didn't like about them was the vinegar dipping sauce, but it didn't bother me too much as I just didn't dip my dumplings in there. The Singapore noodles were also delicious and had the perfect chewiness to them and came with generous portions. The sautéed string beans came with rice. Although this is generally a pretty basic dish, it tasted amazing. I loved that the string beans were cooked with ginger and red chilli pepper that gave the string beans some interest. I didn't know I could eat so much vegetable at once, but I finished the whole plate.   The waiters here were also nice and welcoming. Service is very fast.   The only thing I would wish here is that I wish they would put ice in their water and provide straws with water cups. I'm not a fan of room temperature water and no straws.   Overall, I recommend this place if you're looking for some good Chinese food the Squirrels Hill area."}
{"text":"I've had take-out from here twice now and both times I was really pleased! Most recently, I tried their pork soup dumplings- wow. The flavors were incredible & I loved the chewy dumplings! I would really love to come here to dine in soon!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Chinese/Taiwanese food I have ever seen in Pittsburgh, especially when you cannot stand with the spicy Sichuan food any longer. Nice location and great service, good for guys have light flavor like me :)"}
{"text":"I have only dine in once but did many takeouts from here before! The food is so good I'm so pleased everytime! The service and the employees were so nice here unlike some places in the SQ *eyes rolled*  The xiao long bao, salt & pepper squids, short ribs with black peppers and mala spicy chicken are probably some of my favorite dishes from here. They made it just right! I found myself ordering these dishes whenever I come here so I gotta branch out to some new dishes next time!   On the weekend I feel like it can get really busy here and it's not a huge restaurant either so you'll probably want to call ahead.   Ps of course they got bubble tea too so that's always a plus ;)"}
{"text":"This new find is a must visit!! It seems to be run by a couple Taiwanese families and is super authentic. I say this because so many patrons seemed to be related to the employees and didn't even need a menu.   We ordered the steamed dumplings for an appetizer. It came with eight and was perfect for sharing. The dumpling skin is very thin and will probably rip on your chopsticks, but man is it delicious.  Then we split the Taiwanese squid and shrimp in lobster sauce for dinner. I cannot rave enough about this squid. It was paired with so many fresh vegetables and really showcased the squid. The waitress insisted we tried this and I do not regret that decision at all. I have become accustomed to dishes that feature seafood to skimp on the portions but both had very sizable amounts of seafood.   The menu is full of wonderful options that range from $6-$20. We got all of the above for $30. My next visit, which will be sooner rather than later, I plan to just order what the customers next to me are having because they all seemed to be pros."}
{"text":"I love going here with a group of people. It's usually pretty packed but the service is quick so you'll be seated faster than you think. The longest I've waited is probably like 15minutes.   The portion sizes are pretty good, but it's always a good strategy to order family-style with others so you can taste the wide variety of items they have there!   Would definitely recommend this place to small/decent sized groups. Great taiwanese food!!"}
{"text":"This has become my favorite restaurant in PGH. Everything is delicious, the service is great. Love it."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. All of their seafood options are super fresh and always tasty. The egg plant and shrimp is a go to for lunches while I'm at work, but the chicken pot pie with basil and garlic is also delicious. They do have Boba tea is a very wide selection, and all sorts of really good small appetizers. The pork soup dumplings are top notch, so are any of the fresh vegetable preparations. Squirrel Hill has tons of Asian food options, but this one is definitely hiring kick in terms of quality and consistency. I've really never had a bad experience here. Some of the menu items are definitely more authentic than others, and if you're looking for Food court Chinese food this is not the place to get it. I love authentic Asian style food and Taiwanese bistro 33 certainly has it. During the summertime they have a fantastic little patio deck out front and the service is always extremely prompt and nice."}
{"text":"I came to visit Pittsburgh for a weekend and found myself eating here twice before I left because it's that good. The food is amazing and I haven't ate something I didn't like (maybe except the soup dumplings). There's a lot of variety with the menu but I would recommend the string beans (forgot the whole name but there's only one of this dish under the vegetable section), the stone pot chicken, pork with bamboo shoots, and the sweet and sour pork tips. The soup dumplings didn't have much soup which was disappointing so I would avoid ordering it. Some reviews say that their food is greasy but like idk where you would find taiwanese/chinese food that isn't.   Their drinks are also really good! They come in these large glass jars so they are so cute. Would recommend getting one if you eat here.   Another plus is that the restaurant is clean! The wait staff does their job well and I did not have a problem with service. My only disclaimer is that my boyfriend spoke fluent Mandarin which made ordering and interacting with them much easier. BUT they DO speak English. You just need to ask questions if you need clarification about any dishes."}
{"text":"Overall, I really liked this place and am looking forward to trying more.  The service was great and there are tons of options to try.    We had the soup pork buns as an appetizer.  I liked them, but would venture on to something else next time.  The boyfriend had the short ribs with spicy sauce.  I sampled one and gave it the seal of approval.  It was crispy and flavorful and just spicy enough.  He did say that a couple of pieces were spicier than the one I tasted, which he appreciated.   I got the chicken basil.  I actually didn't love this dish, but it was mostly because it was a poor impulse choice given what I was actually in the mood for.  It was a well done dish, though, so I can't blame it for my being unsatisfied.    My main criticism would be that there are actually too many options.  The menu was 5 or 6 pages long, with just basic descriptions.  I had trouble sifting through it all and I definitely had trouble picturing what some of the options would look like.  Some of that is my own ignorance of the cuisine, but I appreciate a restaurant that attempts to help a girl out.  I don't need a picture menu or anything, but a website with some photos or expanded descriptions would have been helpful.   I also didn't know whether they serve alcohol or are BYOB or what.  We had bubble tea and water, but weren't offered anything else.  Again, these are things I would typically look up online before going, but there wasn't any website available that I could find."}
{"text":"Overall it's a decent place. If you are used to Rose Tea and would like to switch it up a tad, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Another bucket list restaurant of Pittsburgh checked off my list! I've always heard great things about Cafe 33, but I haven't had the time to eat here yet. However, my aunt's birthday was today, so she picked Cafe 33. Perfect.   When I walked in, the first thing I noticed was the cute decor. Traditional decorations hung on the ceilings, as well as a pretty beaded divider that leads back into the seating area. The people were very friendly as well as our server. She taught me how to correctly use chopsticks and made our party laugh.   The food was to die for. For appetizers, we ordered the beef tendon and fried stinky tofu. The beef tendon is excellent and is served cold. The stinky tofu was awesome and thankfully not too stinky. But that wouldn't have mattered to me anyways, I would have ate it. I love tofu! We also had the pork buns- they were great. For dinner, I had the pork intestine with Chinese hot peppers. The peppers had a bold flavor and the intestine was delicious. My family also ordered beef with eggplant, pan fried noodles with shrimp, chow mein, beef with Chinese hot pepper, and the stir-fried rice cakes. I really liked the stir-fried rice cakes- the rice cakes were like soft, chewy rice balls, kind of like gnocchi! Also, I had the red bean smoothie for a nice refreshing drink. The red bean is very sweet, but not overpowering. I was pleasantly surprised by it!   The service was super fast. Our appetizers came out within five minutes after ordering them and the dinner came out about two minutes later. They are mighty quick!   If you want truly authentic Taiwanese/Chinese food, Cafe 33 is the place for you. It's an amazing ethnic food experience and it's perfect for adventurous eaters. I loved it, it's probably my new favorite Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. I will be returning!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Good customer service, but not intrusive or in your face.  If you're lucky, you'll be able to get an outdoor seat!  I would really like to see this place succeed.   *** Update***  I just want to reiterate that this is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh if your criteria are REALLY tasty, original food at a very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"This isn't my first rodeo with trying Taiwanese style cuisine, so I did have some high expectations for this new restaurant. Let me start off by saying that it is most definitely authentic and the menu itself is pretty extensive. What I enjoyed was the different options; everyone loves options. We started off with pork and vegetable wonton soup. This came out in a fairly large bowl, so we all split it 4 ways. They didn't skimp out on wontons, vegetables or broth (thats important). I think it's safe to say that we all enjoyed this soup very much! For my entree, I ordered the duck yolk pork chops. The breading was nice and crispy, however, they kept the bone in almost ever piece. This was kind of frustrating, so I can't say that I was a fan of that part. My cousin ordered the sweet and sour pork chops and they also had the bone left inside. My mom and aunt ordered the vegetable rice noodle dish and really talked it up the entire time we were there. Some things to keep in mind, parking isn't the greatest and it's not the biggest restaurant. Expect a wait."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the food was all fairly bland. The noodles were a bit mushy, the Kung Pao Chicken was more pepper than anything. I wasn't in Pittsburgh long, but there are probably better Thai places"}
{"text":"If your looking for stinky tofu , this is the place.  Very authentic considering it's in Pittsburgh  Great server and friendly, gave us great suggestions  Definitely would come again"}
{"text":"I think it's depend on which food you eat.  What make it great:  Dumping Awesome service Super clean Noodle  What make it weird and less of the taste of Taiwanese food:  Cutlet( which I think it's too American) Soup( which it taste really weird)  Overall, it's a nice experience for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"A popular Squirrel Hill restaurant, but we timed our Christmas Eve visit perfectly to get a table before the dinner rush. The scallion pancake with beef was quite nice, with cucumber and a dash of Hou sin sauce inside. The steamed dumplings were done just right, with a light rice wrapper. The hot and sour soup comes in a giant bowl to share -- we had the vegetable version and was a big hit (but not too spicy). My daughter was sad to find that she could not get bbq pork spareribs, which have become her favorite Chinese restaurant dish, but the sweet and sour rib tips were quite tasty -- not too sweet, a classic sauce -- and turned her disappointment around. The eggplant and garlic sauce were good. And the Mala spicy chicken, which we took a flyer on, was sort of a particularly spicy version of salt and pepper chicken. As long as you're careful with the hot peppers, it is my favorite dish here so far."}
{"text":"So, I'm always wary of beef noodle stew at Chinese/Taiwanese restaurants because a lot of them have started to use really low quality beef that is really chewy and gross. I am happy to report that this location had nice delicious tender beef chunks in the beef noodle stew. The dish was great, they made it not spicy for me and it wasn't spicy at all. The broth and noodles were very tasty. I am really happy to have found a place that makes a good beef noodle soup and I will surely be back again for more. Also, their rice is great."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! The place is cozy and well decorated. The staff was really friendly and very attentive. We came here on Friday night for dinner. Fortunately, it was early so we didn't have to wait for a table. Keep in mind that The tables are small and actually pretty close to the next table.   We ordered the sweet and sour pork chops, soup noodles, beef or pork stomach, pork belly sandwich and a warm milk bubble tea. The food came out really quick! I really enjoyed the warm bubble tea and the sweet and sour pork chops which came with a small bowl of rice. It was amazing! I don't remember if it was pork or beef stomach but it was good. The dish was cold with a kick of spice.   Overall, I really enjoyed my experience and I can't wait to come back to try the other dishes! I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent Taiwanese food!!! Had the spicy beef ribs and seafood special, both exceptional! The ambiance is really nice and chic and the taro bubble tea is a must! Can't wait to be back here!"}
{"text":"YAY for another Asian eatery in the 'Burgh!  While I wasn't thrilled with my meal here, I fully acknowledge that a restaurant needs ample time to feel out its kinks and fine tune to become the best possible version of itself, so I hope to be able to upgrade this review at a later date...a much later date.  However, any extra competition in the market for this cuisine makes me too excited to wait to try it, and Rose Tea Cafe could certainly stand to get knocked out of their comfort zone.  The effort was certainly there--the dining room was sleekly adorned, if crowded (during our Saturday lunch, they set out a plastic folding table in the center aisle to accommodate a party), and the staff was warm and welcoming, both unusual qualities for an authentic Asian restaurant.  It would be nice though if the servers could educate themselves about menu items, because they found it difficult to answer most of our questions about the dishes and had to run back and forth between our table and the kitchen to help us figure things out.  My unfamiliarity with the nuances of typical Taiwanese cooking and traditional dishes, coupled with my extreme pickiness, er, I mean, measured selectivity, meant I had a lot of questions.  Sorry not sorry.  Also, any restaurant that designates dishes at market price should at the very least anticipate questions about that.  We settled on the STEAMED MINI SOUP PORK BUNS (A16), MARINATED HOT PEPPER (A21), BE FENG TONG SHRIMP (E6), CHICKEN WITH BASIL IN CASSEROLE (C1), MINCED PORK WITH CHIVE STEM IN BLACK BEAN SAUCE (P17), and SAUTEED KING MUSHROOM WITH SALT & PEPPER (V11).  My friend had wanted to try the PUMPKIN WITH DUCK YOLK (V12), but it was priced at a \"SP\" of $17.50, which, unless those preserved duck eggs are from organic, pasture-raised ducks and the pumpkin is one of Dan Barber's artisanally-bred Blue Hill Farms mini-squash, is pretty far-out ridiculous.  And I wanted my favorite water spinach, or SAUTEED SEASONAL CHINESE VEGETABLE (V6), but not enough to fork over $14.50 for something that costs $2 to make.  Market prices.  They're the best.  All dishes tasted passable but not great--a general lack of flavor made it difficult for the food to wow us.  A slightly heavier hand with salt would have been appreciated in general.  You could taste that the pork buns COULD have been nice and porky...except that they were bland.  This was particularly sad because the aroma was there, and they even brought out a small dish of black vinegar with shredded ginger to dip them in, but the lack of seasoning just killed it.  This was also true of the peppers, which seemed like they had been marinated in oil with absolutely no salt (they tasted purely of heat), and the chicken with basil, which was pleasantly saucy but had no taste of basil.  The meat was also not the best quality--extra gristly.  Sad. The pork dish overwhelmed with an aroma of oyster sauce more than anything else, which wasn't a BAD thing, except that we were hoping for the black bean taste as the name enticed, which really got shoved to the side.    However, my single greatest letdown was the mushroom dish, my own choice off the menu, which came out deep-fried.  Perhaps this was partially my fault--perhaps this dish is always deep-fried and, being a novice to Taiwanese food, I otherwise would have expected this obvious fact or should have asked for yet another clarification on.  But, as it stands, I saw \"sautéed\" on the menu, and I didn't question that they would be simply wok-fried naked, as I expected.  They were rock-hard and remained largely untouched by our table.  My bad, guys.  I did not try the shrimp, as they which were similarly deep-fried, and I was feeling frier-jaded after my mushroom fail, but my 2 out of 3 of my companions seemed to enjoy them (my fiance just informed me that he found them lackluster).  They were nicely sized at least and came adorned with a sort of dry rub coated breading.  So yeah, not my best work, and it may be a while before I work up the will to return to this establishment again.  However, with the super large menu and the warm, Mandarin-speaking staff, I remain hopefully for vast improvement.  I'm rooting for you, Cafe' 33.  Just one question though--what's with the apostrophe?"}
{"text":"Pictures on yelp showed a very promising Taiwanese cuisine in the midst of Squirrel Hill.  We went for a late dinner with no wait.  Our server was a sweet lady who was prompt and funny.  I was surprised by the good service here since it can be a hit or miss at Asian establishments (if you want to be abused, head down to Rose Tea Cafe).  We also saw how other servers interacted with other customers.  Hella respect for good old service.  Majority of the menu items are Taiwanese, but there are some Korean and Cantonese dishes in the mix.  We ordered the soup dumplings, sauteed chinese watercress, cantonese soy sauce stir-fry noodle, and beef with chinese hot pepper entree.  All that for two people.  We definitely need to be back to try the rest of the menu.  But here's the breakdown of the food we tried:  Soup dumpling - LOVE IT!  Out of all the ones I've tried in PIttsburgh, I love it here best.  The soup is flavorful, the dumpling skin does not rupture, and the soup is not dried up (plenty in there).  Sauteed chinese watercress - good, as expected.  Chinese watercress (or water spinach) is one of my favorites.  Cantonese soy-sauce stir-fry noodle - very salty and a bit more wet than the typical ones I've had.  Beef with chinese hot pepper - Not the best I've had.  The beef was cut very thin and the hot pepper was spicier than what I'm used to.  Not sure if \"chinese hot pepper\" is the same as what other Taiwanese places uses, which is \"longhorn pepper\".  The heat was manageable after a few bites.  The dish is still great, but I don't think I will be craving it from here.  Taiwanese Bistro Cafe 33 is absolutely a 4 star to start.  I'm curious whether the Korean food is any good here.  That's for next time!"}
{"text":"Real Taiwanese food! Staff there are really nice. Definately go there again!"}
{"text":"A fine Taiwanese restaurant with a variety of foods! I came with a friend for lunch, and we each ordered our own main meals and shared soup dumplings. I ordered the Beef Noodle Soup, which was good but didn't stand out from other beef noodle soups I've had. The atmosphere of the restaurant was comfortable, and the waitress was super nice. She was attentive to us and very helpful throughout the whole meal experience. When we didn't eat our soul dumplings right when they came out, she reminded us to eat them while they were still steaming and soft. It was a sweet gesture, and one that I think shows the sincerity of the staff. Would be happy to come again for another meal!"}
{"text":"Super delicious food. No nonsense service. I've dined in and received great service. It can be really busy on the weekend evenings but they were able to quickly accommodate our group of four.   I also like to do take out from here for a yummy meal at home."}
{"text":"BEST ASIAN RESTAURANT IN PITTSBURGH.  Ok, I haven't eaten at every Asian Restaurant in Pittsburgh. However, of the numerous Asian restaurants that I have been to, this is the best. Do yourself a favor and get the Black Pepper Short Ribs. They will probably change your life. Everything on the menu was exquisite. The service was impeccable, and the prices were very reasonable. I'm not sure if our waitress hooked us up, but there was no cork fee for our wine. Parking is a little rough, not much seating, and the smoothie machine in the front is a little distracting, but all is worth it for that Delicious food!!!!!"}
{"text":"There is one thing that makes Taiwanese Bistro Cafe 33 heads and shoulders above all Asian competition in the Burgh: quality. The quality of their food is off the charts. We've frequented this place a few times and the freshness and flavors of their various dishes are uniquely different than the average Asian cuisine joint. The place is small but you can usually grab a table for two or three. It's five star."}
{"text":"Another Taiwanese eatery has arrived in Squirrel Hill, and just a short walk away from the original Rose Tea. AFAIK they are not associated together, but either the owner or one of the operators at Cafe 33 was previously at Rose Tea. So in that sense, it's pretty legit. Being new, the space is nicer and more spacious, but smaller like the size of Everyday Noodles. The menu has a lot of variety and is similar to Rose Tea's (as with pricing), but from what I could gather there is less emphasis on bubble teas and more on traditional Taiwanese appetizers. Didn't try any of the apps this time but the lady did recommend them for next time.  The beef noodle soup and pork belly over rice are two quintessential Taiwanese dishes. They were both solid in terms of presentation and quantity. The rice contained a tasty marinated egg, both diced pork and pork chunks, and pickled bamboo and cucumber. This was good, although I've had better--the pork could have been softer and less dry. Probably comparable to Rose Tea here. The beef noodle soup was another story. Everything from the savory broth to the soft and tender beef to the spongy noodles was perfect. Complementing all that was a smattering of chopped up and pickled vegetables. It was definitely authentic and probably one of the best around, being much more complex than that of Everyday Noodles but also better done than at Rose Tea.   Will update this review after a few more chances to try other things here!"}
{"text":"The first time here, was very exiting to have a great meal after seeing high ratings, but after tasting the food can't say I agree with   the high ratings given to this place. We liked everything about it (cleanliness, service, nice music background, ambiance)... except of food.  All four dishes we've tried (marinated cabbage, cucumber salad, XLB dumplings and chive/egg pancakes) were ABSOLUTELY TASTELESS!  I always thought that Taiwanese cuisine is full of flavors and spices, but they proved me wrong. If it would be my first experience with this cuisine I would never wanted to repeat it again. And for this kind of taste and portion sizes it seems to me very overpriced. So what is the point of going to restaurant if you like everything else, but the food?"}
{"text":"I think i ordered the wrong dish. It arrived and it had no spice whatsoever and if I hadn't known I was at a Taiwanese restaurant, I would've assumed I was eating normal American food from the Midwest or something. Could definitely have been my terrible ordering though!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place... with a very picky taiwanese palate.. this place is extremely authentic. I almost felt like I traveled to Taiwan for a moment with the dishes we got.   If you haven't tried this place, this is a must! We got the beef noodle soup (which I have to be honest was the least appetizing), we got stinky tofu, crispy intestine, spicy seafood pot, crispy salt and peper chicken (a MUST & made so well) and sausage fried rice. Everything was great. I am looking forward to coming here very often!!!"}
{"text":"I like to come here when I don't want to eat spicy food as usual. They have some good appetizers, like pork soup dumplings. For entrees, I always order double cooked pork belly and egg yolk pork ribs. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"I can not think of a better place to move in to that old laundromat space! I didn't think I could have multiple favorite restaurants in the same street, let alone across the street from each other. I came early on a Saturday before it got too busy. My first attempt was last weekend, but I came at 8pm.   It is a small restaurant and delicious, so for obvious reasons it gets crowded really quickly. The decor was very cute. I was surprised how quickly the food came out since the place was so full, but there were a lot of waiters and waitresses running around.   Being vegetarian, I always have questions and my waitress was very familiar with the menu given that it has only be open for a little less than two months! First I had the marinated dried tofu, which to my surprise came out cold and almost instantly. To me it was very bizarre but also tasty! The sauce was not overpowering. I also ordered a vegetable spring roll for my appetizer but it came out after my first one. One of the best I have had! I was obsessed with the sauce but I couldn't quite tell what it was. It was spicy!   For my main dish I had the cantonese noodles. I was very happy with it because it was not too greasy and seemed to have the perfect amount of salt. Overall a great experience. I will come again and try other menu items soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Asian restaurants. The food is not typical and seemingly more authentic. There are items on the menu I would have to be a bit more adventurous to try. Often there's a wait for s table but the staff is very accommodating and the owner very friendly"}
{"text":"they basically have the same menu as Rose Tea Cafe.  And I think some of the servers were from Rose Tea.  Curious about the back story...  chef special was \"shrimps with a salty-egg crust\".  It was really good.  definitely worth a try. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-33-pittsburgh?reviewid=qLM52jdRtf83s1n_s4m3Lg&select=1_JVwPkFMxbZKj16SRCckg  Smelly Crispy bean curd was a surprise (in a good way), though I can tell that not everyone will like it.  steamed mini soup port buns, squid with salt and pepper, and intestine with spicy sauce were all good.    beef chow fun was not what I expected.  There was too much vegetable in it.  Maybe it was a Taiwan version of the beef chow fun, but certainly not the hong kong style I was expecting."}
{"text":"Excellent takeout order.  We had the scallion pancake with beef - delectable.  Vegetable spring rolls.  Chicken with eggplant.  Kung po chicken.  Chicken with rice noodles.   They took extra care with packing and utensils for us.   Just a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"My first time there. The food was not as good as my hopes and previous reviews led me to expect.  Scallion pancakes with egg: good, but I like Rose Tea Cafe's scallion pancakes better. King mushrooms with salt & pepper: these were deep fried, I take it. I was hoping for something less oily, something lighter. But good. Pork intestine with spicy sauce: My first intestine dish. I went into it with an open mind, but came to the conclusion that I don't like this dish: the intestine, vegetables, and broth were ok, but the odor and taste of the dried blood turned me off. Maybe if I had been eating this since childhood I would have loved it, but trying it at age 59 didn't work for me.  I'm coming to suspect that Taiwanese food and oily Chinese food aren't my thing. I prefer Cantonese. If I return, I'll avoid the oily dishes.  The ambience and service were quite good. A little pricey."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite restaurant. The food was absolutely amazing & the service was phenomenal. They are extremely friendly & welcoming. Will be back soon! I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"This place deserves a 5 star for everything: food quality, nice taste, cleanliness and how comfort it feels when eating. The taste is very consistent. We came back twice in 2 days we stayed in Pittsburgh and they tasted exactly the same. The food isn't too salty or too sweet, everything is just right. We ordered the Taiwanese sticky rice, Short ribs with black pepper, basil fish fillet and braised beef over rice. Everything was on point! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good food and nice atmosphere! We shared the scallion ginger beef and the chicken with basil and garlic in hot pot.   While both were good, the chicken stood out. The flavor was strong but not overpowering. The beef was slightly grainy and there were far more onions than meat on the plate.   Also, they were accommodating to a shellfish allergy, which was really nice. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nice, relaxing atmosphere. The option to sit outside is very nice. The service was fantastic and all the employees were very friendly. Bubble tea was good and you get a lot for the price (it's served in a big mug). However, the food was mediocre and disappointing. This place gets excellent reviews so maybe the food wasn't good because we came in an hour before close. I would go back again maybe, in a few months."}
{"text":"Come here if you want traditional but yummy-enough-for-an-American-palate Chinese and Taiwanese food. The people (I'm assuming a family) who work here are wonderful and friendly as well. One man (who I think also works in the kitchen as he wears an apron and runs back and forth) who serves you is so warm and humble and friendly, he makes you want to come back. The Ma Po Tofu is bomb, and their stir fried seasonal Chinese vegetables are always delicious and garlicky, which I am super down with. They have an extensive menu, and the quality of food is definitely above most of the other Chinese restaurants in the Squirrel Hill area. It can feel like an overwhelming amount of options in this neighborhood, so just know that you cannot go wrong id you choose this place.  Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that it can be very cramped inside, with tables pushed up very close to one another, and it gets REAL hot and sticky in the summer in there.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of the better Asian restaurants in Squirrel Hill! Love their food and the decor, very clean bathroom which is always a plus.  Generally speaking, I would say that their food is more based on their home style, traditional foods and not so much Americanized-Asian food but nonetheless it is worth trying! A complaint would have to be parking and the size of the restaurant. First of all, parking in Squirrel Hill is just impossible and if it's your first time visiting, it's located behind the Starbucks! Secondly, their restaurant is very tiny and not very accommodating for large groups or parties. Speaking from experiences, I had difficulty maneuvering in and out of my seat and table because of the small proximity. It's great for parties of four or less.   All in all, I do enjoy their food because it's very similar and reminiscent to home cooked meals. You do get large portions and each entree comes with a bowl of white rice. Also, I don't believe there is a cork fee which is a plus! I recommend it to anyone who likes authentic Taiwanese/Asian food."}
{"text":"7yo daughter and I stopped by on SAT about 8p; right at the end of the dinner rush. We accepted their offer of a communal table to sit within 10 minutes.  The server was awesomely efficient of movement, friendly, and effective in taking our order and making sure we had food in front of our faces quickly.  Daughter got pork lo mein; I got crispy squid sautee. Lo mein was far and away the best I'd ever tasted; real Taiwanese food and that magnificently done. My spicy squid was an epiphany, my new fave dish.  Daughter had mango bubble tea; not too sweet at all. Mine was bubble green tea, half sugar, and was competent.  It was an wonderful experience all around and I've found my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!! Excellent soup dumplings AND great vegetarian offerings. Their fried mushrooms are to die for! As are the sauteed greens, vegetarian fried rice, etc... Also, the service is excellent. I was super impressed with this place. If I had it my way I'd come here once a week!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  It is clearly not a place to linger or seek for fine dining, but the food is consistently good and the service very prompt.  You have to bring your own booze.  One time we forgot and a friend ran down several blocks to bring back a bottle of wine.  You might have to wait but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great prices! Our group had the garlic squid with casserole, beef and broccoli, and other entrees. Everyone loved their choices. The starters were all very good as well. It's a BYOB which is great and they do not charge a corkage fee. The hostesses and servers are super friendly and explain the menu items if needed. The place is always busy which is a great sign of a consistently good restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh~ The food is delicious and it looks good! The place is small. So come early. I like steamed bun,sweet sour rib, duck yolk rib! I will add more if I have a new favorite dish!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here at least twice a month. The salted duck yolk rib tips are the most delicious thing ever. The food is always, always good! The only complaint I'd have is that the service is always rushed because they care mostly about turning tables."}
{"text":"This place is hidden off of the main Forbes/Murray area (but for good reason). It says something when a place like this is packed on a Monday night. We were very pleasantly surprised at the amount of flavor and the portion sizes - the entrees are enough to share between two people. Try the kong pao chicken and chicken with basil and garlic!"}
{"text":"Not authentic Taiwanese food....why, because the ingredients are cheap and bland and everything has this mystery universal brown sauce that taste like a packaged brown gravy.  Sorry, but eating out in Pittsburgh is once again overrated"}
{"text":"What a great place.  We asked our waiter Patrick for recommendations and he suggested their special of the day - golden duck yolk with shrimp.  What a delicious dish.  We knew we wanted to try their soup dumplings which did not disappoint.  The basil chicken in casserole was so flavorful and tender and the scallion pancake beef roll was a home run.  Can't wait to come back to try more of their top notch items.  Nice crowd and a line outside by 6 pm on Friday.  Thankfully they have a to go menu too."}
{"text":"Originally, I really liked this place, as I thought the food tasted authentic and the service was really friendly. However, recently things have seemed to gone downhill.   The food seems to have gotten very greasy across all of the dishes, which I definitely did not think was the case before, as I really liked the fact that the food wasn't too heavy when I first came. Also, the servers don't seem to be as personable, and while they have always been known for a high turnover rate, it seems as if they just see you as another transaction. One time when I was eating with my girlfriend they squished us in a very crowded area between two tables when there were a lot of other open tables that would have been more spacious for us. They agreed to let us move upon asking which was good, but at the same time makes you feel a bit suss as the customer."}
{"text":"The food here is very flavorful! We tried the mini soup chicken dumplings as an appetizer. The pork with bamboo shoots was really good! The shoots just had enough bite. If you like your food spicy, tell your host/hostess."}
{"text":"So this was my first Taiwanese food and I love it.  I have no idea what I ate as the waiter did not seem to speak English.  I pointed at the picture on the menu and hoped for the best.     I looked around and noticed that we were the only Anglos in the restaurant.  Nobody was speaking English and I found the murmur soothing.  There were a couple of the staff sitting at the front table chatting and snapping fresh green beans, which gave me a warm, familiar, happy feeling.    The plate set in front of me contained some insanely good looking freaky food including a brown hard boiled egg.  I took a bite and it made me bop up and down in my seat it tasted so Good!  Apparently this is not normal behavior in this establishment and I caused a bit of a giggling episode amongst the other diners.  I wish I took a pic of my plate before I inhaled the contents, but alas, I did not.  I was not sitting there going \"nom nom nom nom\" the whole time but I wanted to.  I love this place but don't take my word for it, please check this place out for yourself.  I can not imagine that anything served here would be subpar!"}
{"text":"5 stars in Pittsburgh, 4 anywhere else.  This is possibly the best Chinese food you'll get in Pittsburgh (in terms of not Sichuan-style).  Cafe 33 gives you all the great non-spicy options in Chinese food there is, but where they really hit the mark is with their basil, garlic, pepper combination. It's a trademark taste that is just so savory and will seep and tingle your tongue with joy. I've tried several of their dishes with this flavor, and I've got to say the fish and chicken are two of my favorite.   For other menu favorites, I love their black pepper short rib...it's another one of their dishes with exciting flavors. And in addition, they fry their short rib a bit, which gives a bit of crunchy enjoyment.  Overall, the restaurant has lots of savory Chinese options, and consistently delivers quality items to your plate."}
{"text":"I have been pretty dissatisfied with Pittsburgh's Chinese food for the past 4 years I've gone to school here, I'll be honest-Mostly because I'm too lazy to leave oakland/Shadyside. But today going to squirrel hill was so worth it! I saw there was a super long line from outside but was seated quickly as a party of two. Also this place was pretty easy to get to by bus, riding any of the 61's down Forbes. Once we got there, I was comforted by how almost everyone was speaking Chinese (that's how you know the place is authentic). I got a staple dish, the beef stew soup, and my boyfriend got the duck yolk pork ribs. I was blown away by the flavor of the soup and drank the whole bowl! Also the portion size was huge for the pork ribs, had to get a second bowl of rice to finish the rest. You will definitely leave with a full stomach. I would say this place is on par with the Chinese food in manhattan that I'm used to, and they accept card which is of course way more convenient. I will definitely overcome my laziness and come back to squirrel hill again for this place!!"}
{"text":"The salt and pepper shrimp was amazing! Im a shrimp-head and i loved it. Service was good too. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Since my family is Taiwanese, I was very excited to try this place after hearing about it. I really wanted to love this place, especially since they do have many traditional dishes on their menu, had great ratings, and were clearly very popular based on how packed it was when we went. Maybe I hyped myself up too much...  Went for dinner with a friend on a Friday night, so as expected, it was crowded with group of people waiting to get in. It was a 15 minute wait, not bad. From the moment we sat down, however, they were clearly trying to get us out as quickly as possible so they could get as many customers in as possible. The server came back to our table about 2 minutes after seating us to ask us if we were ready to order. We'd barely had time to read the pretty extensive menu, so we asked for a couple more minutes. Server was back in about 2 minutes like clockwork. So we just picked something fast.  Food comes out - friend got stir fried rice noodles. Nothing spectacular. I got the beef noodle soup, always the first thing I try at a \"Taiwanese\" place since it's my favorite popular native Taiwanese dish, but one that's difficult to get right. The broth makes or breaks this dish...unfortunately it was very bland. Even asked for extra heat, and it wasn't spicy at all.   The sticky rice appetizer was tasty, and the boba milk tea had good flavor and nice chewy tapioca balls, so there was that.  Anyways, maybe only 10 minutes into our food, my friend is eating a bit slowly and has put her utensils down. The server comes up and asks if she would like a box. My friend says \"yeah, eventually,\" and before she can say anymore, the server snatches away her plate.  She brings it back wrapped up, and also brings the check even though I am only halfway through my food and still quite actively eating.  We don't touch the check yet since I'm still eating. Server comes back a few minutes later, sees the check is untouched, picks it up and puts it beside my bowl on the other side to kindly remind me its there. Ok, fine...I'm not really enjoying my food at this point with someone so intent on getting us to be done and leave, so I get my food boxed up and pay so we can leave.  After my food is boxed up, I'm trying to finish my giant mug of bubble tea as quickly as possible without having to swallow boba balls whole. Another waitress comes over and asks \"are you waiting for something\"? I'm just trying to finish my drink, c'mon...literally sucking it down as quickly as possible without choking on tapioca.  I really don't care if the server is friendly or not...I'm there for the food and not smiles and small talk. I get it, weekend nights are busy and there's a wait line and you want to get as many customers in and out as possible. But being made to feel like a huge imposition from the moment we sat down, which made eating very unenjoyable, plus our food just being average, makes me hesitant to come back, even though I'd love to explore the menu more."}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant in the city, and probably the only Chinese place I will take my parents to from now on when they visit. I've been here many times and each time the food is consistently delicious. It gets really packed on weekends and evenings so try to call ahead. Personal favorites include the scallion pancakes wrapped over beef, ribs/eggplant dish, and the basil fish casserole."}
{"text":"Decided to come here on a whim and so glad we did. We came around 3:00, and were able to sit down right away. I imagine that it would fill up closer to dinner time.   We tried the soup dumplings, beef stew noodle soup, Chinese watercress and a short rib dish. All were very good! We were told that the watercress typically sells out.   Our server was super helpful in giving us suggestions as it was our first time there. He really made our experience awesome! He even showed us the best way to eat the soup dumplings so that we didn't waste any of the soup! :) Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"OVERALL: one of the best Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh if you're looking for authentic and traditional Taiwanese food.   Cafe 33 is a fan favorite amongst CMU students and my group of friends, for good reason. We know that we can always get good quality Chinese food here, and while it does get busy on weekends and such, we're always seated and served in a timely manner. The prices are also pretty fair.  If you come here (which I recommend you do), try and get their traditional Chinese dishes. I am impressed with the high quality of their vegetables, because it's hard to find places that make such great Chinese vegetable dishes. The Chinese watercress is a favorite of mine, despite the high seasonal pricing. The string beans with minced pork are also great. My personal favorite is the salt and pepper pork, which is crispy and flavorful.  I already come here very often, but I definitely will be coming here again."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Went with a friend and it was all excellent! The noodles are the best in my opinion :) - staff was great as well! But try and get there early or be prepared to wait, as they are always busy!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, I ordered the Gua Bao, Dumplings, Crispy Spicy String Beans, and the pork chop over rice.  Everything was fantastic, my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach, I couldn't stop myself from ordering more.    They also opened the garage door for the summer and its looks like street stand you see in Taiwan.  Great place for groups too. The more people the better, more food to share."}
{"text":"Food is okay the dining room too crowded and noisy  But their location is good and not too far from my apartment and I wish they have more dim sum selection"}
{"text":"Authentic Taiwanese food! The staff here speak mandarin but also speak English. They're super friendly and are always sure to clear up any confusion you have about the menu. She kept saying she wanted to confirm the order to make sure we were getting what we wanted.    I know y'all have probably heard nightmares about stinky tofu, but it's always been one of my favorite parts of going back to Taiwan. The stinky tofu here is definitely milder than the ones you'll find on the streets of Taipei but still tastes good. It doesn't have that pungent smell you're probably imagining but still has that crisp outer later encasing soft, silky tofu. If you don't know what it tastes like, it tastes a bit sour but again, this was a very mild form of stinky tofu, probably to appeal to more western tastes.   We also tried a few other small plate/appetizers. We had the turnips cake which is usually found at Cantonese dim sum restaurants but these were slimmer portions fried on all sides. They weren't the same as the ones traditionally found at dim sum but a good, sharable appetizer. One of the disappointing appetizers were the steamed mini pork soup buns. The flavor was good but the skin on them seemed a little dry and they weren't bursting with soup. As you can see in the picture, they fall a little flat. Not the soup dumplings I was expecting.    One staple dish for Taiwanese kids is minced braised pork over rice and it's served with a tea-soaked hard boiled egg. This dish had plenty of rice but also a good amount of the actual meat and sauce as well so you're getting your moneys worth. Would definitely recommend this dish for everyone.   Ordered a few more dishes and enjoyed them but nothing spectacular. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone seeking authentic Taiwanese food for a reasonable price. All but the soup dumplings lived up to my expectations and we enjoyed the meal and service!"}
{"text":"easily the best Taiwanese/Chinese restaurant!! the service is nice and the food is even better. I heard that the former Rose Tea Cafe chef moved to this restaurant. my favorite dishes are the FRIED CHICKEN CUTLET OVER RICE & the MUSTARD GREEN AND PORK NOODLE SOUP. the former is the standard go-to for me and many of my friends, and it never fails our expectations. however, the interior is not very spacious and feels very cramped (everyone is seated very closely), which make sense because they want to serve the most people they can. when the weather is nice, they open the front garage and have outdoor seating. hopefully they can expand since they almost always have a wait during busy hours.   tldr; food 5/5 interior 2.5/5 service 4/5"}
{"text":"I ate here with a large group, and we tried several dishes. The food was quite good. The service, however, was terrible. The lady serving us was extremely impatient and clearly trying to rush us out as quickly as possible. When she had a question to ask us, she abruptly interrupted our conversation and then angrily snapped at us if we paused for a moment to think before answering or asked her to repeat something. We also had plates and chopsticks just suddenly taken away while a few of us were still eating. If none of these things bother you and you only care about the food, give it a try. For the rest of us, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"sticky rice and pork rice. Very delicious!!!! I think this is the best Chinese restaurant in town if u don't like spicy food. This is totally the style for no-spice  eaters. U got to try this."}
{"text":"This is a new place which opened on Shady avenue in Squirrel Hill and I had heard good things about it. The food was good, but not really worth the hype. We got an appetizer, which was appetizing but cold. Typically, such appetizers are marked clearly as cold in the menu, that was not the case here. We also got a double sauted pork belly and a plate of watercress. The pork belly dish was quite good but the vegetable priced at $14 was disappointingly bland. The service was decent and the location is amazing. 3/5 from me."}
{"text":"This place has lots of options which is really nice.   We got the soup dumplings as an appetizer. They were super fragile though and cost $9!! And they were mini. Probably wouldn't get again but they were pretty good.   For entrees, we got the dried sautéed chicken with hot pepper and the chef's special, chicken and salty fish with chives. The chicken was super good. The chef's special was also pretty good (although in my opinion the sauce makes it kind of hard to tell the difference between the chicken and fish) and it was covered in chives. My only real issue was I wished they gave more food because it's kinda pricey.   Service was okay...our waitress was actually kinda rude at the end. My boyfriend quickly added a tip pretty close to 15% (though it was a little below, he had just calculated if in his head) and the waitress saw it and circled the receipt and told him to give her 15%!! What?!! If he had seen that error he probably would've just fixed it since it had the amount for 15% on the bottom but I thought that was really rude of the waitress (especially when she wasn't very friendly in the first place). It was an honest mistake and I feel like she was rude in that situation."}
{"text":"My new favorite Chinese restaurant!  Just opened a month or so ago from what I hear; I have already dropped by four times in the past week to sample different entrees and overall, an easy approval.  Recipe execution:  Excellent.  The only Asian place I have been to that does not use too much soy sauce or salt in their dishes.  Perfect seasoned flavor.  Service:  I love to see smiles on the servers' faces as they happily take orders.  Dining room:  Tasteful interior and kept clean despite heavy foot traffic and business in and out.  Here are comments and recommendations:  Salt n Pepper Shrimp. Crispy and delicious.  Could use more shrimps though.  Salt n Pepper Squid. Flavor is there but needs to have a crispy coating and somehow doesn't.  Sweet n Sour pork chops: Sweet and not overpowering.  Meat candy goes well with rice.  Intestines in Spicy Sauce Hot Pot:  Best version I have had since moving from Seattle.  Contains Pork Blood cubes also but it could use more.  These hot pot tend to be salty but it is not that way here!  Definitely would get this again.  Short Ribs in Black Pepper.  The coating and beef is very hot to be careful not to burn the roof of your mouth eating.  Slightly fatty and scrumptious.  Love this one however it doesn't have the outer layer crunch that Rose Tea Cafe's version has.  Scallion pancake w egg.  I guess I was expecting a green onion pancake that was crispy or pan fried.  Take a gander at my photo and you will see.  I would not order next time.  Golden Duck Yolk Shrimp:  Interesting shrimp..  it is coated with egg yolk then with the flour then fried.  The result is a creamy yolk flavored shrimp.  Our table had mixed feelings about this one.  The better half did not like the yolk portion while I thought that the first couple were good then decided it was not my cup 'o tea.  Seasonal greens:  Ong Choy w garlic most definitely on par.  Taiwanese Cabbage was alright but ong choy or watercress is preferred. Always ask for extra garlic.  Chicken Basil Casserole:  Good but my preference is the bone in variety with skin.  Flavor is there and dark meat is tender.  Beef Chow Fun:  I would not recommend if seeking the more traditional wider, thicker and charred version.  Not much beef.  Overall, probably the better Chinese restaurant in Squirrel Hill. We now know what to order as our favorites.  ;)"}
{"text":"This is probably one of our families favorites. We generally get their c1- chicken dish, it used to be called chicken in a hot pot. Beef with ginger and scallions is yummy too. Their soup dumplings are good but the sauce they serve it with is mediocre. They also have fabulous veggie sides!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, fresh and very tasty. Friendly folks set you up to enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  Large menu and great food with options to sample smaller portions. I really like this restaurant but I can't say the same for trying to find a parking space."}
{"text":"New Pittsburgh Taiwanese Cafe in the \"Asia Row\" area as I refer to it. It's on the same block as How Lee, Rose Tea, etc.   A group of 5 came here this past Sunday and we thoroughly enjoyed the food. Here are some highlights:  - Indoor and Outdoor seating - Street Parking or park behind the Dunkin Donuts - Authentic Taiwanese dishes such as stinky tofu, bean curd, scallion pancake roll with beef, XLB etc. - Food was good. A tiny bit on the pricey side compared to the other places but definitely would come back. It was $20 per person including tip. - Service was a little slow but that's probably because it was a busy Saturday night. We ordered a ton of spicy dishes and happened to be drenching in our own sweat without any water.   I will definitely try some more dishes here. A great addition to the Asia Food scene in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"You know you're close to this restaurant when the smell of pure delicious starts wafting closer and closer. Patrick, our server, greeted us with such joy and was excited when we asked for recommendations. They don't call him the recommendation machine for nothing. I had the bean curd with black bean sauce, recommended by Patrick, of course. It was delicious. Priced to please and spices to delight. Can't wait to come again soon."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place. Enjoyed salt and pepper pork rib tips, stinky tofu, scallion pancake, and red pepper chicken (ah I don't remember the name). Really good service. The owner was very enthusiastic about the food too!"}
{"text":"We ended up at this cute little place by accident. The service was great and our server was quick to make recommendations and advise us about the specials. The placed was filled with people but we were served very fast. The food was delicious and served hot.  I would definitely return. Nice people work here!"}
{"text":"Had the best thanksgiving experience ever! The owner Jenny opened their doors even though they were technically closed and invited a few of us to join a family/ friends gathering. We basically ate for free and they were super sweet about having us. Can't think of a way to be more thankful for such a nice act of kindness on thanksgiving day. And yes, the food was amazing! It was my fist time there but will certainly keep going back. Thank you Jenny!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really nice, the staff is very friendly, and the food is delicious! I will definitely be back! Very authentic Taiwanese cuisine. The best that I have had in Pittsburgh yet! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch. Small dining room with what looked like a nice outside dining area. Staff was friendly and very accommodating. We had the cold sliced mala beef tendon which was absolutely delicious, thin slices of gelatinous goodness. The Taiwanese sausage served with raw garlic that was surprisingly mild was also very good. My father had the dry sautéed pork intestine which was very good for him but a bit too funky for my palate.   The  Kim chi sautéed with pork belly was very good. I would like to try this restaurant with a group so we could sample through the menu. That being said I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place is a great place and is is setting up their outside patio seating now that it's getting warmer. Make sure to get the mini soup dumplings! And our waiter was super friendly and helpful. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"New favorite in Squirrel Hill. Had a great wonton soup, and amazing braised pork. Very nice service, and comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love the environment and atmosphere here, making me feel at home. Recommend the bubble tea and green bean, especially the jasmine bubble tea. The service here is good too."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because I came back and gave cafe 33 more tries. Everything I got here so far I'm impressed by it. I got sweet and sour ribs the most recent time i ordered cafe 33. It was delicioussss! I still think the price could be lower though, I ordered the sweet and sour ribs and Taiwanese tempura fish. The total came out to be $18+. The Taiwanese tempura fish tastes better when I ordered it in store the first time. It might be due to the to go order using a closed container, causing the fish to be less crispy on the outside. I would say Cafe 33 and everyday noodles are my two favorite Taiwanese places in Pittsburgh. I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"The food was OK, but the services were awful. First, the room for sitting was very narrow. They put the table super-close to your chair. If you fall back a little bit, they would immediately come and urge you to move back forward once again. Second, the table was oily. Just a random touch to the table made my hand oily. And I had to go to the restroom to wash my hands. Third, I did not know why but the gentleman came just after we had been seated to ask us what to order. We said, just a moment. But the gentlemen came again and again every one or two minutes, asking us what to order, looking like he was urging us to order as quickly as possible. But we did need some time to read the menu and make a decision. Lastly, the waiters were not responsive. We wanted to add a bowl of rice. We raised our hands to call for somebody to help us. But we failed twice. In between, another gentlemen even passed through our table. At that time, two people were trying to cross the lane behind our table, and the congestion caused the gentlemen to stop by our table. We looked at each other and at that time I was raising my hand for service. Then he turned to look downward and avoid looking at me and my raising hand. But soon after, he looked up again as the lane has been cleared and he could move forward. Again, we looked at each other with my hand raising. But he had no response to me, but just left. This made me very confusing and disappointed. Finally, our third trial of raising hand made another young gentlemen come and finished our request. But, the experience at this restaurant made me a decision that I shall never come again."}
{"text":"So good.  This is a great spot if you like Taiwanese food.  Everything is nice  The owner and waitress are nice as well  Feeling from at home."}
{"text":"Wow. I mean really.  1- Patrick is truly a recommendation machine as advertised.  2- soup dumplings, everyday, please.  3- shrimp donuts. No that's not what they are called but that is the heavenly name I came up with and repeated every few minutes (special- Golden duck yolk with shrimps) 4- everything else, cooked hot and fresh with so much flavor: basil chicken casserole, stirred rice cake with beef, scallion pancake with beef.  We can't wait to return and will bring more friends!"}
{"text":"I have heard lots of good things about this place, so I was very excited finally get the chance to try it. I came with a large group and we made a reservation in advance. They didn't really seem to honor our reservation - our table was not ready until about 20min after the correct time, but some of our group arrived late so it ended up working out ok.  All of the food we had here was delicious! As someone who doesn't eat much meat, my favorite was probably the eggplant with basil. I also really liked the ma po tofu, which was just a little bit spicy, but definitely not too much. We also got a fish fillet that was amazing. The menu here is not very descriptive, so your best bet is to come with someone who is familiar with Taiwanese food  The service here was also quite fast. Despite the larger order, our food came out all at once about 20min  Overall, good spot for dinner. Vegetarian friendly and able to accommodate large groups"}
{"text":"This place is SO FREAKING GOOD. My Chinese friend took me here today and she says it's as authentic as it gets. I can't vouch for that but I can say that their food is pretty fantastic.  We had their soup dumplings: delicious. Salt and pepper rib tips: perfectly fried and huge portion, seasoned really well. Chili fish in a stone hot pot: fish was so tender, portion was also huge, and was not really spicy at all. Their Chinese watercress was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The service was really nice and attentive. Our waiter made sure that we were taken care of the entire time. He was so nice!! The prices aren't too ridiculous for the amount of food you get. I really love this place and hope to stop by again sometime soon."}
{"text":"As a new kid on the block, Cafe 33 instantly won us over with above average food and a stellar customer service. Since the restaurant sign had gone up in July, we had been patiently waiting for it to open and thankfully they didn't disappoint. We regularly visit the other Taiwanese restaurant (Rose Tea Cafe) across the street. Hence, for the sake of comparison we tried the same main dishes (Kim Chi Stir Fried Chicken and Sauteed Pork intestine) here that we used to have at the other restaurant. They have an extensive selection of appetizers also. While the two main dishes were as good as Rose tea Cafe, but the Taiwan Style Pork buns (kind of like the Char siu buns minus the sweet n sour barbecue sauce) were definitely the best we ever had. The bun was soft and moist with ample portions of meat inside. The food was no doubt great but what urged us to write this review was their great customer service. They had messed up one of our main dish orders, but once we brought our complains to them they not only apologized earnestly for 50 times but also packed for us the dish that we wanted-completely free. We are definitely sold on their service and will be back again to try their entire repertoire of taiwanese dishes."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the experience was sadly very but very disappointing. Food was not even deserving of one star. But needed to put one to post. The short ribs where gelatinous and season less. The fried rice was as unpleasant. To the point we did not even take the excess leftover home. Can't understand why this place has 4 stars. Thank"}
{"text":"One of my friends recommended this place. The place was small and the service was good and friendly. Parking is an issue. The lot beside the store can only fit in 3-4 cars.   We ordered scallion pan cake with egg and spicy pepper chicken. Scallion pancake was not great when compared to the one you would get at green pepper. However, this is an appetizer which is way cheaper than the regular pancake I get at green pepper restaurant. I don't think I will order this item again.  Spicy chicken was tasty. I am glad to see that they didnot add overwhelming amount of dry peppers. I had the spicy chicken at other places where I felt like I was searching for chicken in a pile of dry red peppers. The chicken is soft and tasty. I will order this dish again when I go the next time.   Their menu offers large selection of food which is great. Will definitely go back to this place!"}
{"text":"My friends and I got together on a Friday night to celebrate my girlfriend's new job. We were seated immediately around 6:30 since it was hard to get a table for 5 around this time of day. I ordered the hot pepper chicken and the table shared the eggplant w/ garlic. The hot pepper chicken was really good and went great with the eggplant. The food came out fairly quick and there was decent service. I didn't get a refill on my water at any point but the food was so good that I barely noticed."}
