{"text":"Wir haben hier vor einiger Zeit ein paar Pizzen zum mitnehmen bestellt.
Gedauert hat es nicht lange, vielleicht 10 Minuten. Aber als wir dann zuhause die Kartons öffneten, der Käse war braun, auf der einen Pizza nur 4 Shripms und ganze 2 Cherrytomaten und natürlich der braune Käse.Ausserdem sei angemerkt das Personal ist schon sehr laut."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a fish taco?  What about having five choices, from fried shrimp, fish or calamari, to fresh ahi tuna or shrimp?  Joey's has rebooted their menu and their look at this food court outlet, and it works. I had the fresh shrimp and super-crunchy fried fish, and while both had their own sauce (Thai Sweet Chili and a cumin-laced mayo respectively), they both shared a fresh and light mix of cabbage, tomato, onion and carrot that had a nice crunch.  A lime wedge is provided for acidity, and half a dozen hot sauces are available. A side order of fries can be had for $2, but for lunch seemed somewhat superfluous and heavy in the stomach after eating these delightful $4 tacos.  Of course if you're into that, they still have the old standby of fish and chips, and fries can be decked out with varying forms of poutinification.  Though you should really try the soft tortilla tacos."}
{"text":"The food is really good, but the service is HORRIBLE, I'm at Market Mall fairly often (I work there) and when Joey's first opened their service was amazing, so I would go there all the time, everyone was friendly and nice (I specifically remember this one older woman with glasses who was funny and sweet and always remembered my name) and the food was great. Then all the nice employees disappeared and they replaced them with young angry teenagers who don't smile or care to pay attention to what you're ordering. I tried going back a couple times after all the good people left, but it was just painful, this one young girl with glasses was always working the till and I felt like she hated me and her job, there were times I would go up to order and she wouldn't even look at me and notice me (she would be on her phone) so I would leave. Fast forward to a year or two later I really wanted Joey's, so I went over and that same young girl is working, same attitude and everything, I ordered my food and I asked her for extra hot sauce on my order (like I always did in the past) and she gives me attitude, says they don't do that and just points to the counter at all the bottles of hot sauce, I hadn't been there in over two years and the last time I was there they would happily put the extra sauce on my order for me, I didn't know there were bottles out, and I don't know why she gave me attitude, but it wasn't necessary. I definitely won't be going back, the employees are all rude and don't care to help you at all with anything, they forget parts of your order and the service is slow even when the mall is dead. I'd prefer to get food from a place where people actually smile and communicate with me (just a \"Hi\" would be nice)...and I really don't think that's too much to ask for"}
{"text":"Also ich muss sagen die Pizzen schmecken ganz gut, ist aber nix besonderes.
Leider ist die Pizza immer nur Lauwarm.
Die Lieferzeit ist in der Regel eine halbe Stunde kann auch mal länger dauern.
Was mir sehr gut gefiel war einmal ein Anruf bei einer zu hohen Lieferzeit und ich gefragt wurde ob ich nich woanders bestellen möchte!"}
{"text":"Its Joey's Only Fish & Chips. Flavor as usual, service was slow, one piece of fish was dropped on the floor when order come out by the staff, so we have to wait longer... Foods only I will give it a 4 stars!"}
{"text":"i was so happy that this place  understood English  when we were in Stade and their was a young girl that was so nice and helpful im sorry i don't remember her name"}
{"text":"Samstagabend und in Stade stand das Pinten-Sprinten auf der Abendplanung! Da musste eine Grundlage her. 
Die Wahl fiel aufs Joey's, da wir alle kein Bargeld hatten und einen Lieferdienst brauchten, wo man online mit Karte zahlen kann. Willkommen im 21.Jahrhundert!
Wir wählten eine Variation aus Pizzen und Pizzabrötchen. Alles wurde super einfach und unkompliziert über das Internet bestellt. Als Wartezeit wurden uns 30 Minuten angezeigt und das wurde auch eingehalten. Für einen Samstagabend absolut in Ordnung. 
Das Essen war lecker und frisch. Es war ausreichend Käse und Belag drauf. 
Allerdings wird ein Stern abgezogen, da die Preise schon ein bisschen überteuert sind. Für die kleinste Größe zahlt man schon 7-10 und da es sich nicht um mega besondere Pizzavariationen handelt, finde ich das leider nicht gerechtfertigt."}
{"text":"Guy with glasses served us...... Just stood there and looked at us... No Hi.... Or acknowledgement. 

I ordered the taco special with fries and a drink. He mumbled back, \"okay so two fish and chips\" um no! I said tacos. So I finally get my tacos. Stood there for a few minutes... I said ..\"can I have my drink.\" Guy with glasses replied \"oh\".  So I'm still Waiting ...waiting,,, I said \"Can I have me fries\" .  Guy with glasses replies , \"Sir you didn't order fries...\" I point to the big sign above his head.,, Two tacos, fries and a drink!  He replies \"You didn't order fries and walked the other way. I said \"I paid for them!!!!!\" And he ignored me. 
I was so dumbfounded I walked away and bought fries at NYfries. 
As for the tacos, they were obviously cold by this point and mostly cabbage. So I will never , ever return. I still can't believe the horrible service. Btw it was not busy, just a few people deciding what to order behind me....."}
