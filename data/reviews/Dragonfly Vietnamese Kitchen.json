{"text":"Best Pho place in town, we tried # 15 which is Spring Roll Platter with assorted springroll with girlled Beef, charbroiled pork and grill shrimps.   After the spingroll we ordered Pho seafood and Lemongrass Chicken Entree. The Pho is completed with shrimp, calamari and tender and juicy brisket. The Lemongrass chicken is top notch with fragrant lemongrass flavors and bit spicy to the taste.   Dragonfly also offer Creme Brulee and Vanilla bean as desserts. However we were so full from the entree and couldn't be able to fit any more. We sure will try it next time.   The services is excellent. The wait staff are friendly and knowledgeable about the food. Dragonfly has been through some growing pain and endure the downturn of the economy.   Give it a try ( or another chance ) You won't be dissapointed"}
{"text":"WEAK SAUCE...literally. Against my better judgment I decided to go to Dragonfly instead of Pho Ao Sen to spice things up a bit. I ordered the Pho Veggies and was sadly disappointed. The broth tasted like they had just started simmering it and then threw tons of salt and pepper in it to cover that up. The veggies were raw, which was fine for the bok choy but not for zucchini or red peppers or mushrooms. And another note on mushrooms, the menu says shiitake and I got raw/dirty button mushrooms. My friend and I were the only ones in there for lunch and the service still sucked. It's a good thing she is sick so she couldn't actually taste the broth (thanks to the half bottle of sriracha she dumped into her pho tai). Probably not going to this place ever again..."}
{"text":"Easy to find right off southern. Not the best I've ever had but passable. Missing several condiments I am used to with pho. Asian cilantro, nam pla, etc broth was good, generous steak and noodles. Not going out of my way to eat here however."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst service I ever had.  1. Had to wait a few minutes until someone greeted and seated me. 2. Didn't offer any drinks or silverware 3. I know economy is bad, but the place is way too hot. 4. Took forever to get my bill. 5 . Finally, I paid with credit card and they charged me extra $ .50 because it's under $ 10.00. There's no sign about paying extra if under $10.00.  Will never come to this place ever again."}
{"text":"The positive reviews are way off the mark.  My guess is though, that like most patrons of this place, they've never experienced Vietnamese food before, or at least quality Vietnamese food. If you've lived in a city with a sizable Vietnamese population, like say, San Francisco, LA, Washington, DC, Seattle, Etc, you would know this place is absolutely the bottom rung for Vietnamese food.   The atmosphere is nice and I had extremely high hopes. One thing that struck me as odd, and probably a sign of things to come, was the almost complete lack of any Vietnamese people there!! Servers or diners alike! I got the feeling most people eating here don't know the difference between bun bo hue and bo luc lac. Nothing wrong with that... you just have no idea what you're missing.   Besides that, the service was awful. This is a HUGE disappointment. Now Vietnamese restaurants aren't known for their service but this place was amazingly bad. Our server never once asked us if we wanted refills, and it took nearly a half an hour to get our Pho. For those not in the know, Pho is extremely easy to make once you have the broth. It should only take 10 minutes or so to have this ready, TOPS.   If you think I'm off my rocker do yourself a favor and visit one of these: Khai Hoan (the best), Da Vang (really good), and Cyclo (kind of over rated, but this place puts Dragonfly to shame )."}
{"text":"Dragonfly doesn't seem to hold too dear to anyone's heart, I only say this because when we walked in there ~6pm on a Saturday night it was completely desolate (if you don't include the one person eating alone).   I honestly don't have enough fingers and toes to count to the number of times I almost made a decision to go here instead of Best Hong Kong or any other restaurant in the area. That night I decided it was finally time to give it a shot.  It would be tiresome to divulge into the details of our indecisive ordering, but the waiter/(owner?) was nice enough to help us through each entree we thought to be the least bit interesting (based on name of course). After about 13 1/2 minutes of debating and almost 2 glasses of their white tea we both ordered something we thought would be fitting.   Less than oh lets say 10 minutes later there it was my yellow curry chicken and her _____(I believe it was something beef? 5 spice?) and both dishes were delicately prepared, garnished immaculately not to mention delicious.  The waiter and staff there was always attentive to our needs and was thoroughly helpful when it came to our lack of knowledge in Vietnamese foods.  I pride myself in reviewing only the places that fit the far ends of the spectrum and Dragonfly seems to have found its place in my heart at the better end. I will be back there soon to fill the newly found void in my stomach for traditional Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I gave Dragonfly a try last night and was very pleased with my experience. Good thing I didn't read these reviews and change my mind. First off, Wednesday night now features a very amusing piano player who plays lots of popular tunes that will have you singing along before you realize what you're doing. There weren't many people there, but our waitress was very attentive and cheerful. The best part by far was the food. I had no idea what to order, but settled on a 5 spice chicken. It was awesome. Great flavors I had not experienced before. We also had a beef dish. Can't remember the name, but it was really good too. I have to say I was surprised. I'll be sure to stop in again the next time I'm out in Mesa."}
{"text":"This is our family go to place for Pho.  It's very good. Other dishes are also very good.  We are regulars with a half hour drive.  The best we have found in the area."}
{"text":"This is my regular go-to Pho place. I'm originally from Tucson and having been spoiled by having 2 Miss Saigon locations there (best Pho I've ever had) I was looking for a new replacement here in the valley. I tried a dozen places or so before I found this little gem. There seem to be quite a few Pho places around here so it's hard for any one to stand out, but the food here speaks for itself. I always end up getting the Pho Tai Chin Bo Vein and it is excellent. They tend to be a little skimpy on their meat at times but the broth is so flavorful (and not overpoweringly anisey) that I don't mind. They also have decent spring rolls but their peanut sauce is lacking- that's my only real complaint. I wish they had boba teas here- if they did I would just never leave!  If you're thinking about visiting this place I'd definitely say go for it! It's a little hard to find at first, being tucked away in a little corner plaza being covered by an Oreganos, so keep a keen eye out! Oh, and if you're into Billy Joel/Elton John type of music they have this musician that regularly plays on Wednesday afternoons. He's not bad- its like Sinatra singing a jazzy Billy Joel."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and it has gotten better! Everything was super fresh and yummy! The food is totally authentic and reminds me of my travels in Asia. I think I will be going here more and more now that it is fall/winter for the Pho. The bbq is also REALLY good!"}
{"text":"In short? Great food! Bad service. However I can't look too far down on them seeing that it seems they are recently under new management & seems to be run by a little old couple. Very friendly owner! Best of all they had vegetarian pho with huge pieces of veggies and tofu. Actually if there was one complaint about the pho, it would be there was just too much going on in it! Huge chunks of bok choy, carrots, broccoli & cauliflower florets... I didn't even come close to eating it all. Pho is one of my meat-weaknesses and I can't express how happy it makes me to find a delicious veggie pho. Makes me want to move to Mesa! I wanted to give it 5 stars, but I took one star due to the lack of efficient front help."}
{"text":"this place was a really nice surprise on a sunday. we had decided to take our bikes out and enjoy the nice weather. of course i was hungry, so we ended up in the saketini/oregano's plaza looking for some food. dragonfly looked cute and inviting so we thought, why not?  when we walked in, only three tables were full and we were immediately sat by the host/waiter/jack of all trades. things that you must get here:  1. citrus white iced tea 2. cream cheese shrimp rolls 3. anything with their charbroiled beef 4. anything with their charbroiled shrimp  the food was absolutely delicious. i had the shrimp spring bowl which came with an overabundance of charbroiled shrimp, veggies, noodles, mint, and a tasty egg roll. i couldn't get enough of it. i loved the pickled cucumbers and carrots and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. the cream cheese shrimp roll was freaking awesome. i had never seen an egg roll stuff with cream cheese/shrimp before but i want to go back and eat 50 of them and then hate myself. it would be so worth it.  between the two guys that were manning the floor (it got as busy as 6 tables when we were there) they did a great job being attentive and being ninja drink refillers. really a great first experience and i can't see myself not going back there. yay dragonfly!  PS... they don't serve banh mi here but the waiter was kind enough to let me know the sammich hook up on Elliot and Warner."}
{"text":"Good authentic Vietnamese restaurant, good service and great quality! I'm in love with green papaya salad as long as seafood combination noodle soup, yummy!"}
{"text":"The name has now changed.  I think the new name is Pho something, although the signage on the building still says DragonFly.  The original owner and his wife are no longer working or cooking there.  They moved to California, but the owners parents now keep the restaurant running.  The service and friendliness is still very good, but the food yesterday was mediocre at best.  I don't know if we just had a one time bad experience, but the food was not very good.  We ordered some Pho and the broth was not up to standard and the ingredients were mediocre at best....and the veggies were very sparse.  Just some basil and a handful of beansprouts.  The egg rolls seemed as though they were old and warmed over leftovers.  You could definitely tell that they were not fresh.  And my wife's crepe was super greasy and inedible!  So we probably might not go back again, even though we have been frequenting this established ever since they opened years ago."}
{"text":"I used to work here when I was going through beauty school and I'm pretty sure it has become my golden standard for judging Vietnamese food. Nothing measures up to the flavor and freshness of this place. I still love it and will travel from central Phx to mesa just to eat there.  Open one in central Phoenix, I swear it'll take off!! and I will work there a few shifts again too :o)"}
{"text":"#39 = AMAZING. The Thai Tea is also amazing!!  Yes the place is usually not full, but don't let that scare you.  Love this place."}
{"text":"We just recently moved from San Francisco, and we are happy to find this Vietnamese kitchen here in Mesa. The taste of pho (beef noodle soup) is authentic and delicious. We also ordered the BBQ pork w/ vermicelli noodles with chili sauce on the side. The restaurant is a cafe-style atmosphere, clean, and very pleasant to eat in. The Price is about $7-8 per item; it is a bit more expensive than in San Francisco due to less competition. We also love their home made dessert for $3.50 and will definitely revisit soon."}
{"text":"It seems to me a strange decision to take your typical vietnamese restaurant and turn it into a not-so-typical vietnamese restaurant and then raise the prices, but not the quality. The old vietnamese restaurant that stood in the same place was typical and nothing to write home about. When I saw the new place pop up a couple years ago, I was intrigued but never thought to go there, being that there are at least 2 restaurants in that same plaza that I would much rather go to. But I had the urge to try it with a friend and I came out unimpressed. There are about 5-7 Vietnamese places within a 10 mile radius of this place and I find it strange that their prices are higher than all the rest. Their soup in pho wasnt especially good, though it was passable. Their rice dishes seemed to be on par with others but for the price you would expect more. The only redeeming thing about this place would be the more contemporary decor that you don't see in most other Vietnamese places. It was cleaner and from the table setup you could tell they are aiming for a higher echelon of clientele.    The bottom line: The food was ok. The ambience was better than most. If you care about such things then this may be the place for you. As for me, I'd rather save a couple bucks, endure a nondescript dining area and go to one of the many places just minutes away."}
{"text":"Been going here for a little over 2 years and the owners feel like family. The food is always amazing and fresh, the owners are super friendly. You can tell the little lady gets joy out of making her food for people and she is damn good at it.   I recommend the Pho, Vegetarian fried rice with veggies, Orange Peel Chicken and the Angry Chicken. Oh yeah, and the spring rolls are killer."}
{"text":"Love their shrimp rice paper rolls dipped in a delicious peanut sauce with a hint of chili sauce.  Also enjoy their veggie pho."}
{"text":"My friend and I split a Steak & Tendon small pho and a banh xeo. We were both very satisfied and full after this meal. This is the best banh xeo that I've had in Arizona so far. If you've never had a banh xeo before, it's like a Vietnamese style crepe/omelette. The outer part is egg, and inside contains: bean sprouts, meat (pork, I believe), and shrimp. You cut a piece of it, and then wrap it around the large lettuce leaves. Then you dip the lettuce wrapped crepe into the fish sauce, and enjoy.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE BANH XEO! If you've never heard of it, or tried it before, I highly recommend it. Share with a friend if you're scared to try new things. If you're adventurous, try it on its own, I think it's very filling and can serve as a meal.   The pho is ordinary, but other members of my party were jipped on some meats that were supposed to be included in their soup. Small size is definitely enough, even if the waiter thinks it's a \"children size.\" Service was okay, but I'd definitely come again, just for the banh xeo. :)"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time today a couple months after eating at their other location in Tempe & being told that this place was \"more authentic\" by our server there. Went here because we were huuun-ga-reee and were craving pho ga (chicken noodle soup, essentially). I was with a non-red-meat-eating friend. I eat nearly everything, but really adore good pho ga. Especially since I'm starting to feel under the weather.   So we very disappointed that the only broth options - even for the chicken and seafood pho - were pork & beef. Way too bad, because there's nothing like a good Vietnamese chicken broth. And the lack of veggie variety continued as we perused the appetizer selection...not even a veggie or solely seafood spring roll option.  We bypassed the apps, ordered Thai iced teas (pretty good and made in-house as the glasses arrived with the tea & milk liquids just starting to intermingle), a chicken/lemongrass bowl (reported as refreshing), and the beef stew (tasty but tougher than I expected...perhaps that's the way it's traditionally meant to be).   The items came within 10 minutes of ordering, which was nice. But not even by our server, who apparently was overwhelmed by the other two people she was waiting on. Which reminds me - we weren't greeted when we came in, and an old napkin from the previous party was still on the table when we arrived. And left for me to use, because for whatever reason, server-person had determined that I didn't deserve a fresh napkin. Holy crap, I forgot to mention this. I'd been so distracted by their lack of veggie-friendly choices that this didn't even register until later in the meal.   Ok so now I'm getting a little miffed. When we asked if the broths were chicken and if there were any veggie or seafood-only spring rolls, server-person simply said no. She didn't make the leap from these q's to perhaps suggesting some veggie-friendly items on the menu, because this would have taken effort. Which was consumed by the other two people she was waiting on. And the hurrying to get one fresh napkin for our party of two.   Sigh. I think a couple of things are apparent: I really wanted good pho and good service. I'm picky about both, and perhaps a little more so because I have waitressed before. And been to Vietnam & had great pho in other cities. A combo which on this rainy afternoon, only set me up for disappointment."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place.  Since the restaurant is located on busy Mill Avenue at a corner spot I assumed it had to be fantastic.  When you walk in the decor is of course asian themed and contemporary.  This joint tries to make Vietnamese food edible to novice palates.  Unfortunately, they fall short.  This is unfortunately as good as it gets.  My fiance and I took a seat on the outdoor patio to enjoy the great weather.  There were so many items on the menu and their website that looked and sounded appealing I didn't know what to try first.  This is what we had:  Salt and Pepper Calamari - the breading was nice and light.  However the calamari was so so chewy.  It was seriously like chewing on an erasar.  I really didn't pick up any salt or pepper flavor either.  The dipping sauce was tasty tho.  Dragonfly Signature Spring Bowl with Charbroiled Chicken - My dish arrived with noodles, crispy egg roll and chicken.  It looked nothing like the pictures I saw.  Then a few minutes later our server came with the rest of the greens and vinaigrette.  After dressing up my dish, I expected to taste that authentic \"fish\" sauce.  Dragonfly however, waters down their vinaigrette so the fish sauce is barely noticeable.  It's the tang and sourness of the sauce that brings tons of flavor to the dish and this dish was seriously lacking it.  I tasted the egg roll by itself and it tasted like it was old.  Blah!  It wasn't even wrapped nice and tight but instead was fried with one edge falling off.  I dunked it in the calamari sauce to hide the taste.  During my dining experience on the patio, I had to swat off several bugs that were attacking my food.  A few I killed on my empty plates which was rather disgusting.  My bad for choosing to eat outdoors.  I think Dragonfly has a lot of potential to be a great place.  They have a great location and decor.  Just need to work on taste and seasoning and I'm sure they'd be a hit."}
{"text":"I preface this by stating I am half Vietnamese and almost every weekend I have Pho at my father's home. Nothing beats a homemade bowl of this beautiful broth, and I must admit that because I am spoiled with authenticity I tend to be a harsher critic.  At the same time, however, I do give most Vietnamese restaurants some slack. If you want good Pho, do not go to Dragonfly in Tempe. Please, please, please. Their bowl of Pho is incredibly small and they skimp majorly on the aromatics. Talk about a Pho foul. And what's with the shredded roast-like meat? Oh no, it's supposed to be circle wafers of rare beef.   Instead, visit the Dragonfly in Mesa. That place rocks, and they have other authentic soups that the Tempe location does not have. Like the great soup, \"mi\"--that's egg-noodle-wonton heaven. The egg rolls are not good at either location, by the way. If you know the difference between Vietnamese \"egg rolls\" or chai gois, and the fat, cabbage filled Chinese egg roll, then you can imagine how disappointed I was when they brought me some egg roll hybrid with a gross sweet and sour sauce.   I'm glad to see a Vietnamese place on campus, regardless. And if others love it, more power to them and I hope it keeps good little ethnic places like Dragonfly open. Just know that there is way better out there!"}
{"text":"Sadly, this place is closed now. Owner moved back to Cali."}
{"text":"I'm not the most prolific yelper in the world.  As a matter of fact I only feel the need to do it on the two extremes of \"This place can link the sweat off my taint.\" or \"Holy shit!  If you weren't food I would totally fuck you!\"  So with that said I am happy to say welcome to the best fucking restaurant on Mill Avenue.  I know that's not quite the most ringing endorsement given the shit that exists on Mill these days but just take my word for it, I would totally fuck the food if it wasn't...you know...food.  Are you listening to what I'm saying FATE!?!  Suck a dick you perpetratin ass wanna be restaurant.  You should send some people down here to learn how it's done.  Nuff sed.  So anyways Dragonfly is a Vietnamese restaurant that just opened on Mill on 9/16.  I've eaten at their sister location in Mesa which is also excellent but this place wins hands down because a) they have a lunch menu (details to follow) b) they sell booze (full fucking bar, no joke) and c) it's like 5 minutes from my house.  It's the trifecta, the hat trick if you will, the elephants eyebrows, the eels hips, the bees knees, the gnats whistle...you get the point.    First let's start with the service.  It was impeccable.  Very attentive. Very friendly.  I'm aware that when a restaurant first opens they all try to kiss your ass so let's just hope that this holds out.    Next let's move on to the food.  The awesome lunch menu which is only $7.50 includes either the soup of the day or a green salad with a vinagrette dressing.  I went with the soup which was a very tasty asparagus and crab soup.  Asparagus and crab.  Before you even get the main course.  For $7.50!  Needless to say it was delicious.  You can't really go wrong with those two main ingredients in my book.  We also ordered the traditional spring roll for $3.95 which consists of rice paper rolled around shrimp, pork, vermicelli and mint leaves.  Dip that in the spicy peanut sauce that comes with it and try and tell me it isn't fucking awesome.  Go ahead.  Do it.  I wanna see you try.  That in and of itself could be a light lunch for a lot of people.    Back to the lunch menu.  So anyways for the aforementioned $7.50 you can choose between an assortment of pho (traditional Vietnamese soup) or a variety of sandwiches or a couple of salads or a spring bowl or rice plate.  We got the Pho Tai which contains lean beef and round eye steak.  They bring you a little side plate with bean sprouts, mint leaves, jalapeno and lime which you use to dress it up to your specifications.    It is delicious.  I was there with my old lady and since I know she's reading this, I mean my young, gorgeous beautiful lady.  Happy now darling!?!  And we both got the same thing and all we could do was talk about how good it was from the moment it hit our table.  The conversation consisted of shit like \"Imagine how good this is going to be when it's cold out.\"  Her reply \"Or when you're sick.\"  My thinking \"Holy shit I can't wait to get sick cuz this shit would so rock the hell out of a cold!\"  That's right I wished for illness just so I could experience the soothing effect this soup would have on a cold.    I know I'm totally building this up too much.  I'm really, really biased because I love Vietnamese food and this place is just as good as it gets when you're talking Vietnamese but regardless of all that it really is just damn good cuisine that you can't beat for the price you pay.  I highly recommend it.  I have yet to hear anything negative said about the one in Mesa and this one just managed to raise the bar.  Please go and check it out.    That is all.  Thank you."}
{"text":"BEWARE THE FISH MINT!!!!  This was a new experience for me. I've been to oh-so-many pho places all over the country, and not one of them used this traditional (but disgusting) herb called FISH MINT.  Spring rolls - basic - can't go wrong?  oh but it could...  Everyone kept tasting this fish taste and we thought maybe the shrimp had gone bad (we are in AZ, folks).  Then my friend's salad came out.  FISHY.  Then my bun.  I put all the leafy greens in there liberally (I do love my greens), and then I got this big mouthful of... ROTTEN FISH.  BLECH!!!!  I literally spit it out and almost gagged.  Finally I called the waiter over cuz I was bankin' on a free meal (what with the vegetables being left out with rotten fish, or something), and he just laughed and said, \"Oh!  That's diep ca!  It's very good for you.  Some people don't like it... Next time we'll leave it out.\"  and that was that.  Ick.  Who likes the taste of rotten fish?  I actually like the taste of fish sauce, so it's not like I'm a total nay-sayer on all things fishy... but DAMN... that $h!t tasted NASTY.  I had to google it, cuz I thought he was just making it up.  But there really is an herb called FISH MINT.  BEWARE!!!  The Pho is safe.  Apparently they don't serve it with pho."}
{"text":"I like coming here for pho.  This place is now closed.  I don't think they'll ever reopen since the next door Korean grocery store has taken their space."}
{"text":"I have a bad experience when come here before and I never come back again. The food is not good as I expected. Maybe I come back some days and retry."}
{"text":"Quality bowl of pho!  The soup is a tad bite sweet but still darn good.  The noodles were cooked well and when the bowl of goodness reaches you the beef is still slightly pink.  It isn't overcooked and shriveled up.  The crispy rolls contained a cream cheese shrimp mixture which was really strange.  The spring rolls were ok.  We were the only people there but that may have been because it was dinner and st patty's day.  Pho can be more of lunch meal.  Anyways, service was great."}
{"text":"Pretty good little pho joint. My regular lunch posse (that is what I like to call them - because it sounds better than me and 4-6 engineering dudes) wound up here today somewhat by accident, but overall I think we were very pleased with the service and the pho.   The gents all ordered their usual beef pho and I had a chicken in a beef broth. The servings were huge. One of my companions ordered the large bowl, which would have been enough to feed three small children (or this guy). We eat at a lot of Vietnamese restaurants on our lunch outtings and one of my regualar cohorts recently made the best Pho I have ever tasted - so our expectations may run a little  high. So, a 3 star review from me for pho is a pretty good one. I'll definitely head back to try out some of the other menu items soon."}
{"text":"It is under new management.  The food is not quite as good as before.  The spring roll wrapper was dried and hard as if it was made a while ago.  The pho soup was too peppery, which is very unusual."}
{"text":"It is our favorite Vietnamese restaurant. Never disappoints and we really love the Spring Rolls."}
{"text":"The service was awful so I would that a 1! I give it 4 because the soup was delicious as were the spring rolls! There was a lit of thick meat in the soup and the basil was superb!! Th rolls were very fresh ingredients and the Thai tea was top notch as well!! I recommend it for the food but service no thanks. The ambience itself was nothing cool either."}
{"text":"A real mom-and-pop place. Love the pho and the spring rolls. We come here every now and then. We ordered a chicken dish one time and it was great. I think it was the Angry Chicken. The next time we came and ordered it, it was terrible. The pho is always consistent though. This is our go-to spot for pho.  The lunch specials are huge portions for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Meh. The only thing worse than the food here was the service..  Evertime I went for lunch it was dead (no shock). Even with no one in the place the servers were absent.. And now... Yep they're closed. (Big shock)."}
{"text":"This place blows.  Staff doesn't have a clue about customer service, (except a cute waitress but she was working on the patio).  Food was blah.  Spring rolls with out Thai basil, seriously? Pho was alright, but the sides of sprouts and basil were almost spoiled.  Horrible, no. Below average, yes."}
{"text":"Pho-licious...  Yes it is true I've finally had Pho, and oh how good it was. Now perhaps it's my first time, and my proverbial Pho cherry has been popped, so I may be skewed in my opinion.  You always remember your first, so I have to give Dragonfly 4 stars for food. The place is clean, has good service, but I just wish it was a bit more quaint, and less like a cafeteria setting. I think dimming the lights, adding some ambiance and music would help a bit.  Overall I had a great experience. They have a nice happy hour menu, liberally discounted appetizers, cheap drinks, including exported beers, except the Vietnamese \"33\" beer.  Of course being a purveyor  of good taste I order this and was told \"sorry this beer is not on the happy hour menu\" So I quickly moved West  and order a nice Chinese beer.  It was crisp, light, and refreshing. My date and I ordered a nice Vietnamese crepe stuffed with pork and shrimp for an appetizer, this was also not on the happy hour menu, but it was delectably  worth the extra cost.  Again, we both have excellent taste!  Then came our Pho, we both ordered the brisket, and were pleased by all the accompaniments that were brought out;  sauces, bean sprouts, limes, jalepenos, and a nice sprig of basil. This was the perfect meal for a cooler night. The broth was tasty, and the noodles firm yet cooked to perfection and the beef was tender and seasoned well .  As we ate energetically, we discussed all things considered, enigmatically pondering Asian culture and eating habits with chop sticks. We opened the table to topics ranging from the movie we just saw, our days events, to other random Pho-enix happenings.  The Dragonfly seemed to have a great menu, with very low prices. I hope people check this place out, it may be a new favorite hang out for me. If they can just dim the lights a bit......Pho-real."}
{"text":"the food is always so vibrant and delicious, I swear I can hear her singing in the kitchen sometimes. We are always greeted with a smile and great service :)"}
{"text":"Ugh. We absolutely hated our experience here. When we first arrived, the host (who was standing outside at a stand) called us \"sir\" and \"madam,\" which I thought was a little peculiar but not in and of itself annoying. Little did I know that ~32 minutes later, we'd look back and think of his misplaced etiquette as the only positive thing about our dining experience at Dragonfly. The service was totally unimpressive, especially given that the restaurant wasn't at all crowded, and the $4 happy-hour-special Long Islands were more sour mix than alcohol, but what really turned us off was the overly sweet, sugary, and poorly-thought-out food.   We started with the \"Mill Avenue\" appetizer sampler. The only real standout was the cream-cheese filled puffs (ironically, the least authentic item) - the other items, including the sauce, were just off. The spare ribs were dry, the paper wrapped around the spring rolls was tough (telltale sign that they hadn't been freshly made), and the sauces were watery and had no zest at all. We eagerly looked forward to our entrees but when they came and we tried them, we found ourselves wishing for the flavorless and subpar - but not disgusting - appetizers. My husband had the mango beef - I used to work at a Vietnamese fusion restaurant where this was featured on the menu, and there, it consisted of thinly sliced beef with tender pieces of mango and a oyster sauce. Here, it was fatty chunks of beef with underripe mango in a sickeningly sweet, sticky sauce mixed up with a bunch of unrelated \"sauteed\" veggies. My yellow curry chicken and shrimp tasted less like a complex curry and more like a meat and veggie mixture (think bad Chinese) tossed in a paper bag with a whole jar of curry powder.   When the waiter came to clear our almost-full plates, he asked if everything was ok. Our philosophy is usually to say something in response to that question only if something is fixable (e.g., a meat can be redone to be less well-done). In this case, the whole restaurant concept seems to be centered on serving flavorless and poor-quality large portions to a university crowd they seem to think is un-discerning. With so much wrong, a complete overhaul would be necessary. And, so...we said \"We're just full. Thanks!\" and got the hell out of there!"}
{"text":"There used to be a tiny little fast food Vietnamese joint on 6th Street and Mill that banged out pho for cheap, cheap, cheap that I used to frequent all the time. Unfortunately the ingredients reflected the price, they never so much as purchased a sign, and it ended up going out of business in less than a year.   I can only cross my fingers and hope that the same doesn't go for Dragonfly Vietnamese Kitchen. The original is wicked fantastic and located in Mesa that has been around for a couple years and consistently produces some great pho (tripe and tendon anyone?), papaya salad and noodle dishes I have ever had. And at this new location they've created a sleek, urban eatery that fits right in with the rest of the locations on Mill Avenue, but manages to trump them in every respect. (Price, service, ambiance, and of course, the FOOD.)  Dragonfly just opened a week ago and has a large banner instead of a sign advertising their presence, but judging by the lunch time crowd, word of mouth has really worked for this place. Their lunch time specials are impressive, with offerings of papaya salad, spring bowls, rice plates, several types of pho and Vietnamese sandwiches with soup or ginger vinaigrette dressed greens as a side for a humble...wait for it...$7.50. I'm still baffled at how they can offer such plentiful, healthy, delicious food at such a reasonable price.  The soup of the day was Dungeness crab and asparagus soup, and there was no way I was passing up crab soup for a measly salad. It was such a good decision to go with double soup (pho and soup du jour) because it was peppered broth with HUGE chunks of real crab, asparagus, mushrooms and baby corn that was out of this world! We ordered the spring rolls as well, which were also HUGE with poached pork and shrimp, vermicelli noodles, mint, lettuce, bean sprouts, and cucumbers wrapped in rice paper and served with some of the best spicy peanut sauce I have ever had. The soup and spring rolls would have made a perfectly adequate lunch, but once the pho arrived, I dropped everything for this brothy delight.  It was served in a HUGE (picking up on the trend here?) square bowl with thin slivered beef, vermicelli, and scallions and garnished with bean sprouts, lime wedges, fresh mint, jalapenos, sriracha chili sauce, hoisin sauce and soy sauce. Any combination of these additional ingredients will result in a savory concoction that can help you nurse a cold or open your sinuses, all while warming you to the core. It's fresh, healthy, light and scrumptious! I can see myself eating her very, very often in the future, and straying from my usual order of pho to branch out and try other things on their menu, all of which are still reasonably priced for a Mill Avenue joint (FUCKING SUCK IT BOA!) at 8 to 12 bucks an entree. I would also highly recommend the fresh squeezed limeade, made with sparkling seltzer water instead of still, which was a refreshing spritz of flavor. They also have a full bar, a must for Mill Avenue joint.  The outdoor patio is surrounded by a pretty twisted wrought iron canopy exit at the front of the store and will offer a lovely dining experience since the weather has started to cool down. Inside the restaurant, the color scheme (green, white, plum and black) and ambiance create a fresh, vibrant, urban feel with large bamboo fixtures nested in beds of smooth black rocks. After talking to our server we were also informed that they hope to have a mellow live musical act in the middle of the restaurant in the near future for diners to enjoy.   The service was also AMAZING! Prompt, friendly, easy on the eyes, and attentive. The food was ready lightening fast (almost too quickly considering our first courses, but I can see how the speed is great for getting people on a lunch break in and out) and the waiter was charming, making sure we got everything we could possibly need at lightening speed.   I really, really, REALLY hope this place does well because I want to become a regular here. So go check it out and support a local business rather than a shitty chain on Mill Avenue. I can only hope more of these gems continue to pepper this ever increasing stretch of vapid consumerism, so I don't end up feeling like a corporate whore after my meal. Don't want to taint a dining experience this good with whoredom.  *****UPDATE***** They have happy hour specials now from 3pm to 7pm! Half price appetizers: Tamarind chicken wings, lettuce wraps, crispy shrimp wontons, hoisin glazed spare ribs, and Vietnamese salt 'n pepper calamari! Domestic bottles 2 bucks, Imports for only a buck more, top shelf well drinks for 5 bucks, and house wine for 3 bucks.  Thursday through Saturday they have live jazz on the patio from 7pm to 10pm. Best thing of all? They extend their happy hour appetizer and drink specials to their customers during this time. So you could eat and drink cheaply anytime between 3pm and 10pm Thursday and Friday! AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Dragon Fly once and I'm not that impressed. Restaraunt looked very nice.   Service wasnt the greatest. Not really sure what was wrong with my waiter that day.....not to friendly.  Onto the food. I ordered the Pho and my girlfriend ordered the vermicelli noodles with grilled meat and eggroll. My pho seemed very artificial. The pho just didnt taste right and seemed very oily.  I took 2 bites and couldnt stomach the rest so I pushed my bowl to the side. My girlfriends dish was pretty good. I actually ate most of her order. LOL. I even ordered one to go as well.   Prices are pretty decent.   Ive been meaning to give them another shot but live to far."}
{"text":"After spending a combined seven years as a graduate student at ASU, imagine my dissapointment when I came to discover that there was finally decent Asian food walking distance from campus... two months after my departure for internship in San Diego.   Dragonfly combines what I like about Vietnamese food (variety, flavor, price) with what I like about a modern, trendy restaurant (good decor, modern music, attentive servers).   Though everything on the menu is above average, one item really stands out; cha gio cream cheese. I believe at this location it's called tiger rolls. Completely inauthentic, and I couldn't care less. DAMN they're good. When I drive in from San Diego, I often head there on my first night in town, occasionally as soon as I hit the Phoenix area, before stopping off to drop off my bags. Honestly one of the best things I've tasted anywhere. Highly highly recommend."}
{"text":"okay, i was pretty thrilled when i heard there was a new restaurant on mill ave and to top it off it was vietnamese!! my husband and i are always looking for good locally-owned places to eat and after entering the name of the restaurant into google there seemed to be many good reviews so we decided to give it a try last night.   upon entering i was rather impressed with the interior and of course, you couldn't beat the location! well, that was pretty much the best part of our visit. we were seated and being it was a thursday evening and the restaurant was still new...it was rather empty, but there were a handful of people sitting outside.  the menu was plentiful and there were lots of things to choose from so i was pretty excited. i ordered my usual \"pho\" and my husband ordered \"bun bo hue\"....two signature vietnamese dishes. we also ordered a mixed platter of spring rolls.  let me start by saying that i'm extremely easy to please when it comes to vietnamese food (even though i'm vietnamese). being raised in southern california, i've had my fair share of vietnamese restaurants and i've been to them all....the \"hole in the wall\" places and the swanky locations as well. and usually i'm pretty happy with the food...no matter where i go.  so our food came out....after almost 30 minutes of waiting!!! the rolls were pretty decent, but definitely not traditional...really fresh, but rather normal..nothing to write home about. once our soups came out everything LOOKED great, but that was about it. husband's bun bo hue soup lacked any real taste. it was as if they just put a ton of chili sauce in it to make it spicy and just added hot water. it was so incredibly bland and the dish was just poorly made. my pho was just as much of a dissappointment. for such a signature soup, i was really expecting more and it was extremely below average. i ALWAYS finish my pho and i didn't even get through half of this....   now the finale...after a lame meal, we were left with a check of over $40!!! WTF!?!? i could have gone down the street to khai hoan (which i highly recommend to those who really want to know what good vietnamese food taste like) where their service is fast, their price is much more reasonable, and their food is superb!   i will never come back. the service was horrible, it took forever for her to come take our order and she never came to check on us once. the food was totally over-priced when you could get the same exact thing at a more authentic vietnamese place for half the amount. my parents were coming in to town this weekend and i was really excited to take them to a new vietnamese place, but i surely won't be taking them here. do yourself a favor and visit khai hoan on apache before going to this place. ugh."}
{"text":"Average.  Not too clean, table smells like dirty rags."}
{"text":"Goddess got it right.  This place is pretty, and it looks so promising.  Big disappointment.   There was nothing for vegetarians.  The food was mediocre at best.  I'd choose Pho Nhat over this pretty restaurant any day.  Don't judge a book by its cover.  No good."}
{"text":"Ah, the Pho cup... full of steamy broth, basil, onion, chives, noodles, slow-cooked brisket and bean sprouts. Ah, how I love you. You give me warm feelings in my belly and you make me want to snuggle up for a nap. You are comfort food - so good!  But, give the Saigon Crepe some credit, too. What a way to kick start the meal. Yep, talk about an appetizer to surprise you with how good it tastes, especially dipped in the mildly spicy chili/vinegar sauce. Loved it! The standard Chinese beer (on happy hour price) hit the spot, too.   My belly was so full, it wanted to burst."}
{"text":"Hey Dragonfly - FUCK YOU!  We were starving and driving down Mill on a Saturday afternoon when this place caught our eye for the 9th time... we decided to give it a go. We had tried to eat there once before, but it was at night and it appeared to be some sort of techno dance club with a DJ instead of a restaurant. On this day though, they were open and actually quite empty. I love Vietnamese food, but my favorite place is in the ghetto and really far and I can't talk many people into going with me. There's a place near my house, but it sucks.  We walked into Dragonfly, stood at the hostess stand and skimmed the menu and quickly decided we were ready to sit down. There were two other tables of customers there and dozens of empty tables yet he sat us next to the shitter. DON'T FUCKING SEAT ME NEXT TO THE TOILET YOU DICK! I didn't say anything, but god that really bothers me.  Anyway - we were seated and then left alone... We read through the menu... three times. The prices were pretty high for Vietnamese food I thought, but I don't care as long as the food warrants it. The decor really wasn't winning me over... at least the bathroom door wasn't. The food on the menu seemed to be very accessible and non-traditional based on the descriptions. It was like American food with a Vietnamese presentation... I don't necessarily have anything against that as long as it's good.  So we continued to re-read the menus over and over again - discussing what we would eat if we could, but then we realized we had been seated there for a long time and nobody had even taken our drink order or given us waters. I mean, we didn't just walk in and seat ourselves - someone was working there - I swear it. If we had seated ourselves, I can guaranfuckingtee you we wouldn't have sat next to the can.  We continued to wait for about a half an hour with no drink, food, or sign of an employee - so we bailed and went to Big Fat Greek where they at least treat you like you exist.   I really wanted to eat at Dragonfly - honest - I really and truly did... they just wouldn't let me."}
