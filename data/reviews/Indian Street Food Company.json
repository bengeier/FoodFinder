{"text":"Wow what a foodie experience.  I was transported to Mumbai! The decor is simple and trendy. We went on a Sunday night and called ahead for a table. It was crowded with about 3 tables unoccupied and the rest perhaps 20 or more occupied.  There was pictures of India scattered on one wall opposite a cool list of \"rules\" such as no phones, no flirting etc. and a cool elephant with sunglasses.  Lighting was dark and music was a little loud but it added to the ambience and was warm and inviting. Service was excellent and attentive with multiple people assisting with taking orders, drinks, changing plates and checking in on us. The food was exceptional!  We had the pappadum plate to begin and lobster samosa and they were perfect appetizers.  Food took about 30 minutes to arrive so I recommend having appetizers and spreading out the meal.  The flavours were all so amazing that the tasting menu may be the way to go next time.  We didn't as we were dining with our 2 teens.  We also had 1 basmati rice, 2 garlic naans, the prawn curry, chicken Tawa and butter chicken.  The tawa chicken was a little spicy but perfect in every way with a beautiful curry with white chicken and potatoes.  The butter chicken was traditional and the perfect mix of sweet, tomato based and spices.  It truly was an amazing meal.  With 5 juices and a pop and bottled water it came to $115 including service which is included on your bill.  I tipped on top even though it says no tipping because I was just amazed by everything. The manager checked in on how we enjoyed the meal. We had a few left overs as well.  One of the best Indian food meals I have had in Toronto and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Our first visit here. We ordered the eggplant fries served with yogurt and mint, which were very good.  For main courses, we ordered the butter chicken and veggie stew. The butter chicken was good but not great. The veggie stew (made with jackfruit) was good and flavourful. It was served with a puff pastry top.  Garlic Naan and basmati rice were good.   Overall we expected a great meal and it was very good. Service was very good.  12% tip is included in the bill (as an administrative charge)."}
{"text":"We ate at Indian street food twice. The first and last time. Our reservation was for 8pm. We were seated at 9pm. We started by trying to order 2 glasses of wine. Of the entire selection only 3 (red and white were available). Our waitress took 15 min to bring us menus, and than another 15 min before she showed back to take our order. We had noticed an (s) next to one of the items. We asked her what this stood for and were told she had no idea. Instead of offering to go and find out she simply just stood at our table and asked for our food order. We then asked about the soy bean tikka, and were to,d she seen it come out of the kitchen and it looked nice. We ordered the fish in banana leaf, sag paneer, and 2 other non descript dishes. The bill came and we were told that we could leave a tip despite the big sign that stated no additional tipping.   Bad service, and mediocre food. Too bad. We had heard such great things."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant multiple times and it's our go too restaurant , every dish is delicious the decor is warm and inviting the service is excellent my favourite dishes are the cauliflower and the eggplant fries for appetizer and for main the butter chicken ,the qorma, the chicken tikka masala which is mouth watering as well as the lamb chops . I've tried almost every dish there and it's just delicious  and I also recommend the delicious bread that comes with your meal and after all that delicious food  you have amazing desserts to choose from (highly recommended)everyone I see I tell them to check it out and it's becomes there go too as well I've always had the best experience and I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place, the food was great.  We had a number of appetizers and shared some mains (came with a group of 7) and particularly enjoyed the Lotus root dish.  The ambiance was more casual than I was expecting but the service was quick and friendly.  I particularly enjoyed the welcome drink :)"}
{"text":"I frequent a lot of restaurants. The 2-star review is for the food we ordered. The ambiance is 3.5 star and the service is 3 star. There is a flood of people trying to eat here. From what I'm told lunch is relatively quiet but during dinner when I was there groups of people were lined up waiting for the next table to open up. Sadly, the menu itself doesn't live up to the name. I let all that go hoping that the food we ordered would be really tasty. It wasn't. 2 of the 3 dishes we ordered were mediocre at best and serving Pav Bhaji fondue style doesn't work if your goal is to actually eat the dish. I may or may not return and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Outstanding!! Some of the most delicious food we've ever eaten. Great service, excellent advice and extremely flavorful dishes. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We came with our kids for a celebratory lunch. Luckily we had made an earlyish reservation so we got seated promptly. The menu is a mix of street and snack food but it definitely has the casual fare of any roadside Indian restaurant. The flavours were on the more authentic of the Indian food spectrum at least for the northern and western Indian items. The service was less impressive. Maybe they were just too busy but we were served 2 dirty plates in a row, waited too long for items and menus and drinks, had to repeat orders to multiple servers, and just did not connect with the staff at all. You just got the sense that they were putting out customer fires and trying to stay afloat, rather than flowing with the busyness, or building their story or the uniqueness of the food they were presenting. Every little thing in that restaurant has a story, from the food to the slogans to the photos on the wall. I wish we had felt like learning more about it and the people running it but we just didn't have the chance. So do go for good food but don't expect to learn much about the actual Indian street food culture that drives this place to exist. Maybe try when they are less busy..."}
{"text":"This is when you know that Indian restaurants have turned a corner. Amazing authentic food and decor to boot. Try the lamb chops, the gosht dhabali. Amazing. They have taken a huge leap from the Indian buffets that plague the city. A tad pricey but so worth it."}
{"text":"Great food! Unique taste, small portions and pricy. Good ambiance.   Overall, nice location for special occasion."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try a good Indian restaurant, but had no knowledge whatsoever about Indian cuisine. They have a 6 course tasting menu, or a 3course tasting menu. Unless you are a beast, 3 course should suffice.   I strongly recommend the cauliflower and spicy lamb chop! I personally loved the grilled okra curry, the lamb curry is a must try! Butter chicken was not so special....   Overall, the meal was a great experience, however the service was not as great. The young females waitress is really nice and patient, but the older waiter was not really helpful. But was still nice:)"}
{"text":"Indian food Co has a great atmosphere. The place is kitschy and so cute. However we showed up with 5 without a reservation and it really seemed to stress them out. The menu was tough for a first timer, and felt over whelming. Wish the menu better explained everything so that I didn't have to Google a couple terms to ensure I knew what I was ordering. Drinks were really fresh and delicious. Definitely would recommend ordering a few dishes for the whole table, we all ordered individual meals and once you add on the rice and naan (necessary but not included with entrees) it got pretty expensive and was a LOT of food."}
{"text":"Good authentic Indian food... Love the pratha - you need more than one order! And would be great if the portion is more generous :)"}
{"text":"Upon entering ISFC, we were greeted with an eclectic and vibrant entwinement of tradition and modern Indian decor. There was a traditional food cart, hanging puppets, an assortment of photos and murals that blended beautifully together. Loved the vibe!  On to the food! A combination of hits and misses with generally more hits than the latter. For starters we had an almond crusted Aloo Tiki which was one of our highlights. The perfect balance of tanginess from the tamarind and combination of spices with the crunchiness of the potato cake and noodles off set with fresh herbs and chutney was delicious! The next item was the seafood bhel. This was like an Indian ceviche and was lackluster due to the meek and waterdowned flavours. The last thing we got was the luxury fish thali which came with an assortment of curries. Ours came with butter chicken, daal makhani, Kerala fish curry and saag paneer. Pickles, raita, papadums, rice and naan came with the thali. Good item to order to get more variety. We ordered an extra garlic naan which was truly buttery (or ghee-y) goodness :)  Overall we had a good meal but sad to say we were the only table for the entire Saturday lunch period. Hope with time ISFC can can attract more customers. Looking forward to when their \"high-tea\" becomes available!"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service due to unfair treatment. When my family and I entered the restaurant, the waiter told us that the restaurant was closing due to slow service. So,we were were only allowed to place an order for takeaway. However, a couple after us were allowed to dine-in at the restaurant. Totally unacceptable!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great, I really enjoyed their kothu roti, banana leaf roasted fish and mustard chicken. Not at all greasy, very flavorful! Would definitely go back. Only reason this received 4 instead of 5 stars is the service. Some servers were very friendly while others were less so. Also the no tip rule has been changed since they are no longer charging the admin/service fee."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian restaurant in Toronto that I have been too. The food is great, the ambience is amazing and the customer service is delightful. Their menu is very innovative and tickles your taste buds the right way. Their have a very pleasant wait staff. They are very busy, so please make a reservation before heading over. Bon Appetite !"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time at Indian Street Food - everything was spot on!  My husband and I went out with my uncle and aunt (who by the way was interviewed on the news about this place) as they love it here too.  We arrived first and upon walking in, the décor is definitely modern and kitschy, exactly the type of feel that will match with the food. We were seated and one person offered to take our coats. No sooner, we were provided with a little snack  of tomato soup and bread to whet our appetite. When my aunt and uncle arrived, that's when things got really exciting! We did get to meet Hemant and he was very pleasant. For those of you not in the know yet, this restaurant has done away with tipping which means everyone working in the restaurant gets a fair share. I have to say, love the idea and certainly our waiters were amazing!  But the food...oh the food! Forget about getting your usual heavy, saucy curries that taste the same as every other dish. Each plate at Indian Street Food has their own distinctive flavour and can stand on their own.  MUST ORDER:  Beef Short ribs - TENDER TENDER! We loved this so much we got two plates Eggplant Fries - Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside...one can forget its eggplants The Costal Prawn Curry was delish Lasooni Cauliflower Mushroom Okra Upma (THIS WAS MY FAVE DISH! SOOO YUMMY!) Grilled Okra Vegi Thali Eggplant Barta Naan Rice  Oh my - just writing out all the dishes is making my stomach growl! The food was so delish (it bears repeating again) and paired with a good white (we had two bottles of a Gewürztraminer) the evening went splendidly.  I would highly recommend Indian Street Food and can't wait to go back. It's also a great place to bring out of town guests or people who want to try something different.  Please go and try! You won't be disappointed. This place fills up very fast so resos are a definite must!"}
{"text":"Horrible!Went yesterday for dinner.We ordered vegetarian Thali and what we got was old stale food.There were 5-6 items and you can tell it was old rewarmed food.Never again.For sure they are from some street in India"}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in town. Never had such variety of dishes and such amazing taste. Very polite staff and beautiful decor. Definitely going to visit often."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. Been coming here since it opened (actually since it was Amaya), and it never fails to disappoint. The Lasooni Cauliflower is to die for, and most recently I tried the eggplant curry dish which was fantastic. Also love their vegetable samosas and basically anything I have ever tried. It's always the first place I go when I go home to visit Toronto and the wait staff treats us so well. I don't eat meat anymore but when I did, their butter chicken is the best I've ever had, and everyone I bring agrees."}
{"text":"I think this place has a lot of potential to be given a 4 or 5 star based on their flavours and quality of food. My favourite thing here that I think really stands out is their spicy fried cauliflower. It's packed with flavour and it has the perfect crispy texture on the outside and soft on the inside. We also ordered their chicken curry and it came with rice, which was also very delicious and rich in flavour. Their style is more tapas; smaller plates where you can try a bunch of different things on the menu to share. Atmosphere is nice and cozy, dim lighting.   Things to improve on:   Service is quite slow. From taking the order, to getting the bill, it's quite slow. They also forgot to bring us the garlic naan bread that we ordered, after being reminded twice after ordering it. Fortunately they didn't charge us for it, but we just never got it. Prices are okay, probably a lot to pay for if you just order a bunch of dishes for yourself. Better bang for your buck if you share it and split the bill.   Their menu has a lot of variety but prices are quite expensive even for the bigger plates."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the setting was really good.. relatively small restaurant with great ambiance... not like any authentic indian restaurant ..had a bit of modern upscale feel to it..  I wish the menu had bit more variety. But nonetheless the food  was really great..$60 for two ppl (appetizer, main and 1 drink)"}
{"text":"Amazing orgasmic food !  Super cool twist on Indian food; excellent ambience and service"}
{"text":"Personally I was really unimpressed. I went with a large group and we all had mixed reviews. One person loved his butter chicken. The food overall was ok. The menu was a little weird and not that extensive. The waitress tried hard to explain 'how it worked' but was very annoying and just made us all more confused.  I have been to India numerous times and really none of this food is anything you'd actually get on the street. No samosa, no dosa, no proper chaat, no pani puri, etc. the name is incorrect. I'm not sure why this restaurant has had good reviews.  I won't return."}
{"text":"Hidden gem for Indian food, definitely a must try. The restaurant is quite small, I would recommend reserving first prior to coming. We started off with the punch, it tasted like a sangria, nothing special other than it was in an Indian pot. For appetizer we tried the balgan fries (eggplant fries with a mustard yoghurt dip) it  was out of this world!! First time trying eggplant fries and was hesitant.. However decided to give it a go. I must say it taste better than yam fries , super crispy and the sauce was awesome. Definitely complimented each other. Another app i tired was the samosa, comes in 4 small portions, I loved the different sauces used in this dish. For mains, I tried the beef short ribs plate and the banana leaf wrap roasted fish, both were amazing. The short ribs were super tender and soft. The banana leaf wrap roasted fish (red snapper ) was mouthwatering! The fish was not dry at all, it was super moist and the curry sauce complimented the fish really well. Would definitely be back for some more. P.s also tried the butter chicken which I found to be really dry hence the 4 stars. Lastly to mention they don't except tip, so they charge an admin charge of 13%"}
{"text":"The first time we ate here we had a great meal, but the second time we went for dinner, it tasted as though most of the dishes had been cooked at lunch time and reheated for dinner. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Ambience & decor: Indian Ethnic-modern decor. It's given the eclectic touch by mixing in some street props like 4 wheeled carts, murals with sayings from famous people edited to include 'food' sayings. This is a good addition to high end Indian restaurants which are few in number in Toronto. Beverage: they have interesting cocktails. I tried the 'Tipu' - vodka, date tamarind, sour apple with curry leaves which was quite tasty. Food & service: Staff is very welcoming - the owner spends a lot of time talking to everyone. They include a reasonable tip amount shared amongst all the staff. This used to be 'Amaya' but renamed to 'Indian Street Food Co' with the menu redone to include exotic combinations. I had a 'veg stew pattice' which was made from jackfruit & kohlrabi reminding me of my grandma's jackfruit curry with coconut rice. It was simply superb. We also tried the eggplant fries -different & delicious, Sindhi okra kadhi (good) & bottlegourd kofta (very good). For dessert we tasted the gulab-nut which was a gulab jamoon shaped & textured like a doughnut served on a bed of condensed milk with saffron ice cream in the center. The meal was washed down with masala chai ofcourse. A very creative & delicious restaurant. Will I come back? You betcha!"}
{"text":"This was not good. We were longtime fans but this night was pretty bad. First the women's washroom was filthy. The service was slow, the food no longer what it was. Apps were ok but overcooked, the mains underspiced, indeed tasteless. I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Probably the best Indian food I've ever had.  When I was a kid I used to always go for the inferno type spicy food.  Now I prefer things milder so I can appreciate all the subtle flavours.  That's how I went with Indian Street Food and I wasn't disappointed.  The aloo tikki chaat was excellent with a sensation of flavours.  The chicken tikka and the butter chicken were also wonderful.  I'm going to have to go through the whole menu.  Excellent service and a great atmosphere.  Compliments to the chefs and thanks for a great meal.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'll be direct.   Absolutely excellent food.  Cauliflower  Prawns Eggplant fries!! Samosas Daal Lamb Rice Naan   Creative cuisine.   Wonderful Indian flavoured infused cocktails.   Attentive and charming service.   Warm ambience.   They create food as mild or as spicy as you wish.  Casual and dressy.   Okay...one negative...the music is a wee loud. We were in the front by the window so I've no complaint but would not have been thrilled in the back. That said, no one complained in the back and it was busy. I'm probably just getting old. Sad.   I've been twice and my guests who live in Toronto loved it."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here since I first heard about it. I was surprised to have it listed as a $$$$ restaurant, I don't think it is (edit 4/25: looks like this may have been updated). I could see how if you opted for the Prix fix menu, but ordering a la carte I found just as good.  So we had to try the baigan fries (eggplant fritters), that was really good and bigger than expected. What was even better though is the Lasooni cauliflower (sauced up cauliflower). Imagine sweet and sour chicken saucing up the cauliflower. It was the star I felt.  Then we had the butter chicken, now we read somewhere this is the best butter chicken in the city. I'd have to eat side by side or on multiple days to tell, but I can say it did taste very good. Had an interesting tang to it.  Also had the grilled okra sindhi kadhi,  a different take and flavor profile, I think it takes a couple tastes to appreciate it.  One thing I'd say it's if I knew the size of the appetizers, we'd only order one. Two was a bit excessive, even though the server's say it's not enough.  A few wishes - thali for dinner, and not just veggie - smaller appetizer portions with smaller prices - let me know more often that tip IS included. NOTE to everyone, tip is included though you would not have guessed when credit machine asks you for tip  With all that said, food tasted great and subject was attentive."}
{"text":"I had the samosas and lamb curry with garlic naan.  It was all mediocre at best.  If you like tasteless Indian food this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Ate at this restaurant last week. I would say the food is above par the butter chicken was quite nice. Not bad atmosphere ."}
{"text":"Best Indian in Toronto.  Very creative and exciting dishes that are in a league of their own.  It isn't the typical heavy, oily stuff you'd find at other Indian restaurants, rather some exquisite dishes with perfectly balanced sauces and condiments.  Must try it to understand."}
{"text":"Very disappointed especially after reading all the reviews on this page and on their facebook page.  It is very obvious that the reviewers are not familiar with good Indian food.  Yes, the ambiance is very good.  But the food was not at all what I expected it to be.  The fried eggplant was very delicious because it was freshly made.  The rest of our meal was not so.  It was obviously reheated (possibly taken out of the freezer, heated and served).  The portions were very small compared to the pricing.  Ridicules prices which, I wish was available on their website.  I would have not taken my family there.  They say no tipping is allowed but conveniently add it to your bill under Admin Fee!!!!  What is ADMIN FEE????  I will NOT be recommending this place nor will I be returning at any time."}
{"text":"What Toronto really needs is good distinctive high end Indian places. This place fits the bill. It is classy yet esoteric. We are vegetarians so for us there was a limited but still reasonable selection of dishes. The eggplant fries served with mint and yogurt chutneys was amazing. Each of the three of us ordered a different dish - I got the Sindhi kadhi which is unlike any Kadhi dish I've had - much spicier almost Sambhar like. My wife ordered a jackfruit and vegetable stew which was excellent. Our son ordered a bottle gourd kofta which was very interesting - not the creamy tangy variety you usually get - but in a lentil base instead. Dessert was a hybrid of gulab jamun and donut with saffron ice cream."}
{"text":"One of my biggest pet peeves in the restaurant industry is this trend of under-explaining everything on a menu, which is certainly true of Indian Street Food Company's menu. It's chock full of seemingly authentic Indian dishes, and it's almost impossible to discern what exactly you're ordering.  (Our virtually non-existent waiter certainly didn't help clarify things.)  I noticed, at least, that there was a lunch special on offer, so I figured that would be a good way to try several items. I ordered the Royal Thali (Chicken): 4 oz of curry from the curry section + appetizer + 2 vegetables + dal + raita + salad + papadum + pickles.  It's a *lot* of food. (I guess I should've expected more food than I could handle, given the steep $20 price tag.) Though I'm still not entirely sure what I ate, it was all very tasty. The curry was a butter chicken and it was certainly one of the better variations on that venerable dish I've had in a while. I guess my only real complaint would be the pronounced lack of spice in all the items on the platter. (I also could've used more rice and naan than I received.)"}
{"text":"This restaurant did not at all meet expectations. Food was average, with a select few exceptions (lasooni cauliflower, samosa chaat).   Some frustrating things were; pani puri was not available the day that we came, and many items could not be made vegetarian (aloo tiki and bhel). For an Indian street food place, it is quite disappointing to not be able to eat basic street foods like above. We had the following items: lasooni cauliflower (4/5- tasty but quite greasy), samosa chaat (5/5- the only thing I would come back for), signature chaat (2/5 - super sour), pav bhaji fondue (3/5 - average, not enough bread), bhangain fries (2/5 - so greasy and blah), stew veg pattice (4/5 - different, interesting taste).   Also the other thing that frustrated me - vada pav is $9! That literally cost 50 cents or less to make. I love vada pav, but was so turned off by that. Also, prices like that indicate a very high quality of food. The food here (unlike high end places) was dished out in the matter of minutes, clearly not made to order. If customers are paying these prices for \"street food\", they should at least get a higher end experience.   What was the worst part of the experience however was the initial service. We had two waiters, and the first one was a jerk. He was trying to rush us, and force us to order everything at one time. Very unprofessional and arrogant. The second waiter (sikh young man) was charming however, so I guess the service is hit or miss.   To end it on a less bitter note, the welcome drink was delicious and a nice touch.   Overall, will likely not come back unless to take the samosa chaat to go."}
{"text":"Sketchy, slow service, decent food, exceptionally high prices. I wouldn't go back.  We waited 20 min after being seated for a reserved table to finally see our waiter (only after the hostess asked if we needed anything-like, uh, food?) The service was incredibly slow.  Booked online for the \"retox detox\" tasting menu - 15 courses for $39pp. Well, no one had ever heard of it. Hostess told us that was for winterlicious. And then I showed her their website, so she said it hasn't started yet (the website said it had started on Feb. 15, 2017.) She sent the waiter over, finally. He then coerced us into the 5 course tasting menu which was only $8 more (turns out that one's $60pp). Highway robbery!  We had some tasty eggplant fries, some sort of buffalo cauliflower, 1 burnt-black shrimp each, 1 lamb chop each, 1 chicken nugget-sized piece of tandoori chicken each and finally a huge plate of curries and rice. The food was all good (except for the shrimp), no doubt.  So I guess the real issue is we went for a meal which seemed to good too be true - and was."}
{"text":"First off, poor lighting therefore atmosphere was lacking. Ordered the 6 course tasting and wine pairing menu. The waiter chose some menu items for me - I thought the kitchen would make something not on the menu. If I knew this I would've chosen items that I would've liked to of tried from the menu.  The first course was eggplant fries which were excellent and provided a very promising start. But unfortunately the first course was the best. There were some good tastes among other courses: curry prawn, grilled shrimp, lamb chop.... But the sauces did not standup to boost the flavour. Service was good and there was a full house. The restaurant is only a month old so maybe there are some wrinkles to iron out. Get some bright candles for the tables and edit the menu items to ensure the sauces are as good as the main ingredient."}
{"text":"Love their Butter Chicken and the way the Pav Bhaaji looks and tastes.. the price is on the higher side but i think the food is worth it"}
{"text":"Our first visit here. Loved the refreshing welcome drink and welcome snack served in very rustic Indian style. We ordered the Kothu Roti for appetizer and veg thali for main course. Needless to say this was enough food for 2 people. In the thali, the eggplant bharta, the saag paneer, Sindhi kadhi, dal makhni along with naan and rice were impeccable. Dessert was kheer/paisam and was just right for sweet. All veg dishes in thali were authentic. Will visit again, this place has a very different menu than other Indian places. The vibe was relaxed and the décor and ambience was interesting. Server was polite and helpful in choosing dishes. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"First time giving 5 stars to any restaurant. This place is amazing, they do such a good job of bringing together the different flavors of Indian Street food. The portion sizes are very large as well. We only got 2 appetizers, the chaat papri and aloo tikki, and it was definitely enough to feel two hungry people. Loved it so much that I can still taste it!! The service is also amazing and their decor is super nice. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to venture out to a new type of food."}
{"text":"Place is great, 4 stars cuz I think the bill is a bit pricy, but I would still go back.  The curry shrimp, butter chicken was great. The yogurt is awesome too,   No traditional/domestic beers tho..  We came here with a party of roughly 10 people and shared all the food,   Lamb is made especially well here, had a few different lamb dishes  Would come back here for a small dinner date..  Service was good and cozy."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here Saturday for their Winterlicious dinner menu ($28).    The appetizers, especially their version of the sloppy joe, was excellent.  The main courses of with the lamb and chicken options were okay, but nothing to rave about.  I have the same comment about the desserts of the chocolate samosa and mango cheesecake.  The portions are decent, but don't expect to leave stuffed.  Overall, the food was good but the restaurant did not make my list of having to revisit.  The service to get a drink (even table water) was slow despite not being busy when we arrived.  The food came out fairly quickly as it was probably prepared in advance.  We ordered a garlic nan that was not a part of the 3-course menu which did not come out until we were almost done out main course.  It even came after our desserts as they delivered dessert at the same time as the main which was odd."}
{"text":"I'm no expert but I thought the food here tasted really good.   For 3 people, we ordered the Veg Samosa Chaat (not actually a triangle shaped pastry with stuff inside like I was expecting but oh so very good) the Chorr Bazaar ka Tikka (chicken and other things, some may find this dish super spicy), Aloo Ghobi (a tasty cauliflower dish), the beef short ribs (so tender), coconut rice and Naan (very fresh, just out of the oven). For those who want spice, you'll probably be disappointed with everything we ordered other than the chicken tikka. For our family, it was just the right amount of spice.   Unlike others, we found the service very good (later in the evening, crowd was thinning out). We didn't know what most of the things on the menu were, and the hostess spent a fair amount of time explaining things, answering questions and making recommendations. Very helpful.  No idea about pricing compared to other Indian restos but comparable to other offerings on the Bayview scene.  I'm glad I tried it and we'll for sure go back.  PS... the no tipping policy is no more -- they now take a more conventional approach to tipping. I kind of liked the non-conventional approach but apparently not everyone agreed so the owner decided not to do it anymore."}
{"text":"Came here with family. It's relatively small restaurant with a pleasant environment. It is designed to be more tapas style or sharing so that you can try a little bit of everything. The quality of food is quite good but the place I feel is overpriced for what it does offer relative to other high end Indian restaurants. What is unique about this place is that there is no tipping (unless you insist). It is a departure from typical Indian food so if you want to try something different this is a nice option. The mango cheesecake is quite good as dessert and so is the samosa chat."}
{"text":"I love the concept of Indian Street Food Company. This place was buzzing with energy when we visited on a Saturday evening. So much noises, so hectic and just feel like I was in the street in Bombay.  The restaurant was fully booked. When I arrived at 6 pm for my reservation, our tables was not ready and in fact they were setting up more 2 table of 2 in the middle of the aisle. Maybe it was my fault that my date was late, the wait staff kept asking if I was OK and if I was ready to order. Service here definitely was fast and prompt.   We ordered a few item to share:  Lasooni Cauliflower ($11.90) - interesting taste and texture but a little pricey! Rajasthani Laal Mass ($15.50) - we enjoyed that Kerala Chilli Beef ($15.20) - dried and tough beef jerky  Basmati Rice ($3.50)  The restaurant was quite loud and it did not help when my table was right next to a new born that was crying and whining non-stop for 45 minute while the mother was standing right by our table trying to comfort the baby.   13% Admin Fee = No Tipping Please  I would not say this is authentic Indian food but I did enjoy their playful approach and a little twist here and there. Will I be back? Maybe.... The menu is interesting enough for a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Been here 3 times now. Here is what I have tried and it's delicious. Aloo tiki chaat  Samosa chaat Chor bazaar ka tikka  (chicken tikka ) Kolhapuri chicken salad Dal makhani  Chilli garlic naan Masala tea Creamy vanilla kulfi Pistachio kulfi The ambience is nice and comfortable. They usually have a differnt welcome drink which i think is seasonal and is complimentary plus also yummy. Now about the food - Very high quality food, well  presented and delightfully tasty. Their meat dishes are well cooked and sumptuous.  Their menu changes quite often and is seasonal. So there is a new surprise each time you visit. Strictly advise you to make reservations ahead and they are usually very busy."}

While all portions were ample for the 4 of us, the tables are way too small for all the food and tables way too close together.  Other than those minor problems we will be back for sure!"}
