{"text":"Okay food. Poor service. We were there at 8PM on weekday. There were not many people in the restaurant. There was only one server in the restaurant. We had to wait until we finished all the food, before we could get another glass of water."}
{"text":"Pacific East Solon and Woodmere are my sushi haunts when I want simple, everyday maki rolls and nigiri sushi.  (Pacific East Coventry is my destination for sashimi.)  I would recommend Pacific East to anyone who is new to sushi.

My go-to sushi when I want \"fast food\" are the spicy tuna (for the heat), unagi (for the smoky sweet flavor), cucumber (clean and refreshing), and sweet potato (sweet crunch). Each sushi resto has their own take on how spicy tuna should be prepared. In the Cleveland area, I like Pacific East's best.  The spicy tuna roll is often larger than the other maki rolls but I love its spicy, velvet texture.

The smaller maki rolls are well made though the larger, non-traditional maki rolls can be unwieldy. I have yet to have the go-to maki rolls unfurl on me, though.  The sushi rice has a good texture and is well seasoned, hallmarks of good sushi. The ginger is pickled to how I like it. Only a dollop of true wasabi would complete the trifecta. But, alas, fresh wasabi is not so easy to come by in the Midwest.

The service is always friendly. Once in awhile when I come in for dinner on the weekends I come across the waitress who can't seem to remember anything. The front staff, though, keeps track of what I've order recently in case I want to repeat an order and I can't remember what I had the last time."}
{"text":"Great place to have Sushi & asian lunch or dinner.  Simple, quick service.  Great menu, also have a sister location in Coventry."}
{"text":"The roti chanai and Nasi lemak were delicious.  Malaysian cuisine is rare; we are glad to have discovered this. The sushi is OK but I think that on the next visit I will stick to sampling another of the Malaysian dishes."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the location on Coventry.  This one, not so much.

Food is moderately priced and service is average.

We sat down for dinner and shortly there after overheard a family complaining about the sushi smelling overly fishy.  This should have been an immediate sign to get up and go next door.  

We ordered the Sushi Boat for three, Tempura appetizer, and Nabe Yaki Udon.  The Tempura was well executed and the Sushi Boat was a good amount of food.  We also experienced the fishy smell the family next to us was experiencing.  The fish was as fresh as you can expect in the Midwest.  It was the decorative lettuce that smelled rank.  We sent the lettuce away and things seemed to smooth out.  We all shared the udon and things went down hill very quickly.  The same fishy smell was there. Not to mention it was poorly flavored and the chicken was over cooked.  It was the cabbage in the soup that smelled.  We all got through half our portions before we gave up. I tried to let the chef know but the language barrier was too much and i gave up.  The three of us who had the udon did end up with mild stomach aches.  

Safe to say I will not be returning."}
{"text":"So it begins...  

This is my very first yelp review, and I hate that it is going to be a negative one because I really wanted to like this restaurant.  After a trip to the Apple store, we decided to enjoy what would surely be great sushi in such an upscale shopping destination.  Well...  The exterior looks great, but I had a bad feeling as soon as I stepped inside.  I thought, \"This is it?\"  There is artistically minimal, and then there is this.  Bland, small, and very dark on a beautiful sunny day.

I ordered two rolls: rainbow roll and another roll that was so bad that I forgot its name as soon as I left.  The presentation was heavy on garnish and the ginger did not strike me as fresh.  The fish on the rainbow roll did not look well cut and was warm to taste.  The second roll was tempura lobster surrounded by small crunchy bits of shrimp and then wrapped in cucumber.  Even if this was the presentation that I expected, it was long on cucumber and short on seafood.  Very bland.

The young man who was our waiter was trying hard but had too many tables and was inexperienced.  I felt bad for him.  I did not feel bad for the owners of this restaurant, though.  While I feel that there are too many sushi restaurants these days producing very average sushi, I never thought that this would be one of them!  

I worked at an excellent Japanese restaurant called Sapporo Wind in Columbus during my Ohio State days, so I've had consistently excellent sushi before.  I just can't believe how hard that level of quality is to find these days, though!"}
{"text":"Best sushi rice in Cleveland. Would be nice if they renovated the restaurant. But what matters the most-Sushi is great!"}
{"text":"I love sushi. I ate sushi @ 5 am in the morning at Tsukiji fish market in Japan. Pacific East offers some of the best sushi experience in Cleveland. Fresh fish. More fish than rice in the roll. Friendly owners. Great location. 
I would like them to provide more training for their staff. They are very friendly, however, some may find service not on par with food. 
Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the experience last night. First off there is no kids menu. This is disappointing and surprising considering the  number of kids present yesterday. Ultimately that is not why I am rating this establishment two stars. I am rating it two stars because of the less than average service (good came out very staggered, never offered a refill on water, didn't feel like a guest), poor quality of the food itself (sushi was average, teriyaki beef was way below average) and generally thrown together hole in the wall feel/ambiance (cramped interior in a random spot that reminds me of something just above a take out Chinese place, doesn't match with any of the other places in Eton)."}
{"text":"This place has great quality sushi and they let you customize rolls (unlike the first place I went to after moving here) so I was very pleased. The waitress was friendly as was everyone else that works there. They all seemed very happy to see us, to have us as customers, and provided us with great service. 

My boyfriend doesn't eat sushi but he was able to find something on the menu he liked, the chicken teriyaki. He said it was a pretty standard chicken teriyaki, nothing special about it, but it was good. 

I love tuna so I ordered the spicy tuna roll and the rainbow roll but asked for all tuna on top instead of the assorted fish. The spicy tuna had a great flavor and my customized roll was exactly what I wanted, it was amazing! 

We will definitely be back :D"}
{"text":"Good was awesome but the service was pretty bad. The hostest had to take my order and served me most of the time. It wasn't even busy and its a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good sushi!
I absolutely love sushi and eat it as often as I can.  I originally come from the West coast and the fish is usually sub par in the mid west, but not here.  The chefs do a great job keeping it traditional and not overly Americanizing it.  Rolls are tasty and the selection is pretty varied.  Everything has always been fresh when we go.  The only thing I wish they did was put ponzu on the Albacore.  

 I have to say that I was disappointed when the Solon location closed since it was so close to our house."}
{"text":"The food keeps me coming back for more every time, definitely not the service. I think you can get better service at The Carnegie Deli. Rude staff. Rude managers. Great sushi."}
{"text":"Having dined at Japanese restaurants all over the US, I'd have to say that for the money this place is one of the best. Being in Cleveland, the fish isn't always going to be as fresh as some restaurants located near port cities, but it rarely disappoints.
I first discovered Pacific East (Cleveland Heights location) about 7 years ago and I've been dining here ever since. The quality and taste of the food is very good and the prices are fantastic. Their portions are very generous so don't order too much. The lunch specials are a great value and for larger parties looking to gorge on sushi and/or sashimi, try the King and Queen special. It's a steal! Their Malay menu is also very good, so if you're feeling a bit adventurous try it. You'll be pleasantly surprised.
The wait staff are very friendly and accomodating; and they go out of their way to make every visit a pleasant dining experience. 
I've tried just about every japanese restaurant in the Cleveland Metro area and Pacific East is the only one I've returned to time and time again."}
{"text":"How come nobody said it's in a mall? Next to a Latin restaurant. Across from a bank. It's Saturday night and bustling / loud. Smallish. Red walls. Black lacquer. Mostly Japanese-looking sushi chefs and servers.  A diverse crowd: ethnically, age, social combos, dress  -- which is much more comfortable for me than homogeneous.  I had a craving for miso soup (go figure, I'm a little post-Thanksgiving). Sat at the bar. Got served immediately. It's a fine place. I'm from Chicago so have no biases about sushi in Cleveland. And I'm trying to eat vegan these days: The sweet potato roll was best I've had anywhere. Veggie roll ok too. Had two pieces of Escobar for the omega-3s & it was very, very fresh and delicious.  The meal actually felt decadent because of the size of the pieces -- makes \"normal\" sushi feel skimpy. I had tea too and got out for $20 including tip, full. Yay!"}
{"text":"I can't tell you how the food is since I never got the opportunity to try it! The one star is for the horrible service. My friend and I entered the restaurant and it took 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge that we were waiting for a table even though there were two people working in the front for carryout orders.

Then a waitress told us that there was no space available. She did not give us a wait time or put our names down on a list. She simply told us to leave and that \"maybe\" something would open up at some point. 

I found the experience confusing and sad, especially since I love pacific east in Coventry so much!"}
{"text":"I really don't appreciate the way they treated us.. Really rude service and the owner was really disrespectful.. I was really disappointed they're usually a nice place and I've never been one to complain so this is quite the upset. The owner or whoever runs the front desk was so rude and really condescending.. Such a shame... This used to be my favorite sushi spot"}
{"text":"Absolute Perfection

I have now sampled dishes from both the Malaysian and Japanese menu. Everything is made to perfection. The meals are beautifully prepared and presented and the tastes match what the eyes have enjoyed. I saw some lovely sushi presentations going to other tables. It has moved up to be my favorite restaurant with lots of interesting dishes which I will be sampling for many days to come. I recommend it without reservation to all who enjoy good food. EAU Chagrin Falls"}
{"text":"We dined at Pac East on a recent Friday night, our first visit in a year or more after we encountered spotty service on our last trip. We arrived during the early part of the dinner shift and our party of 4 was seated immediately, which was nice. Our order was taken in a reasonable amount of time, and drinks and appetizers arrived quickly. But our waitress mistook my order for their sashimi deluxe platter instead of sushi. With two kids at the table, I didn't want our meal to be slowed down by having my order remade, so I just ate it. Our food overall was decent, not spectacular. The chicken katsu was a hit, and the sushi was fresh -- although my wife's tuna roll was sloppily made. Table service remained inconsistent, with our waitress not coming back to check on us for a long time after my thirsty son ran out of soda and needed more to drink. When she eventually returned, she responded quickly to a request for a glass of water. 

The dining room is fairly small and noisy, with tables placed close together. Forget privacy; we could barely hear ourselves think over the booming conversation from the next table over."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but I must say this place is absolutely delightful. The service was extraordinary. The food was scrumptious. Never before have I been so happy in Cleveland. I will probably come back every time I want to be happy until I die. Definitely the best sushi I have ever seen, and I have eaten a lot of sushi ."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great service!
I ended up choosing the bento box with sashimi for lunch. The sashimi was very generous portions and very fresh. We were served by a very accommodating waitress, Mandy. Always a smile and very helpful. We also tried one of their peach jelly bubbling sakes. The consistency of the jelly in the drink was very strange, but fun to try. A definite come back!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out. First off they completely screwed up the order. Left out the sauce I ordered and added sesame seeds when I specifically asked for the sushi withOUT. When I called to let them know and tell them I'd be coming back for the stuff left out (and to switch the sushi), I was put on the phone with someone else who pointed out that I wasn't charged for the things they left out and that we never said no sesame seeds. I nicely reminded her that in fact we did specify and we DID order what they left out. It really shouldn't have been a big deal. I wasn't pissed (I get it! Things happen) and was headed back for them to replace/make it right.  Whoa!  They do not know the term \"the customer is always right\", not that I required that, but what I GOT was No apology, no accountability, just defensive and horrifying customer service. They had no intention of replacing the sesame seeded sushi and were quick to rudely point out I'd be charged for the sauce they left out....  Just weird!  I was a regular customer (my kids like their sushi, I do not) but they just lost us as customers."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place everrrrr....well I guess I am only addicted to one roll and one roll only....i love my sushi man :) he is soo funny and always knows what i want when i walk in the door. I even ran into him at McD's and he asked me if i was coming to see him soon :) My favorite roll is the Manhattan Roll with a side salad with house ginger dressing...yummy yummy yummy"}
{"text":"We went for our first time on Saturday!  We have tried many \"Japanese\" restaurants in the cuyahoga area, but Pacific East is by far the best one around!  Sashimi quality was very good but we did not try the sushi, so we are not sure about the rice quality used.  We will definitely be returning soon...and often!!!  Cho oishii!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend for a dinner on a Saturday. We usually go to the Coventry location (I am assuming these two restaurants are affiliated since the name and font match, but I could be wrong). The menu is slimmed down from what the Coventry location offers, but I honestly felt that made it less overwhelming. The food was okay - good, but not anything spectacular compared to other Japanese restaurants we've visited. I definitely enjoyed the mochi ice cream and my girlfriend loved the fried ice cream.

If you like shrimp, what they offer is plenty, delicious, and a decent price. The ambiance was nice but a little loud and at times we couldn't flag down our server to save our lives. We probably would visit again if in the area and craving Japanese food, but we wouldn't plan on going here specifically for a night out."}
{"text":"We tried this after the restaurant we were headed to turned out to have been permanently closed.    We were seated next to this bright, odd display case with a few figurines that still had price tags on them.  The restaurant was probably half-full.  

  Our service was pretty good, except that our waitress seemed to forget our requests until about her third visit back the whole night.  My husband loved his chicken katsu but I was definitely let down by the sushi rolls.  The presentation is beautiful and the chef showed off his knife cuts in the garnish, but the rolls were not flavorful and almost falling apart.  

  The worst part of the night for me was that the one, lone sushi chef quickly ran out of things to do and decided to stand there surveying the small dining room the remainder of our meal.  I imagine this is what eating in a prison surrounded by guards feels like.  I'm not used to this since our old restaurant always had at least four sushi chefs and they never had time to even look up!

  We may return, but definitely not to get a good sushi fix.  I actually enjoy the rolls at our local Heinen's more...."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years now the food has thus far been good, not as great as the pacific east on coventry but good enough. 

Tonight we ordered some spicy tuna rolls and it was extra fishy, I was okay with it; being famished and all. I had to finish off the rest after my dinner guest complained about the fishiness, my lucky day?. My salad had a piece of fish scale in it (hmm how did that get in there?), oh well ... I'm okay its just my luck. Next came the entree, not the same quality as on coventry. One of us was served undercooked beef in the soup ( see attached picture) our waiter said \"okay, what do you want me to do with it?\" we were so shocked we just told her to take it away.

We'll im fed up with this location and have decided NEVER AGAIN. If you are reading this, dont be lazy and drive your tush over to the pacific east on coventry where the hostesses are much friendlier and food worth eating."}
{"text":"I had the chicken katsu and it was really good, I also enjoyed the miso soup. The soup was flavorful without being too salty. But we had just okay service, we were sat down and it took a while for someone to come up to us. And when our server finally came over to us, we were left with the menu for a long while. We even put our menus down hoping to signal that we were ready to order. After we ordered, the food came out in a decent amount of time, but after the food was set, our server disappeared. We needed utensils and we couldn't find our server anywhere and another server was not around. Eventually, we received our silverware and our meal went well from there."}
{"text":"Consistency in their sushi preparation gives this restaurant four stars in my book.  It didn't get five because I have had much better sushi in other areas of the country than Cleveland, but for the area it is pretty good.  Pacific East Eton is always packed at lunch and has friendly and efficient wait staff.  

We have not had any entrees there, only the rolls and sashimi.  The rolls are always good and the sashimi is fresh tasting.  You'll leave feeling full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Phone number disconnected, closing doesn't appear to be temporary"}
{"text":"Technically, I would give Pacific East a 3.5/5 if it was possible :). I came here with my brother and law about 2:00PM on a Saturday afternoon and we were the only people in the place. I started with Miso soup which I thought was good. We then split just two rolls since we weren't overly hungry and were looking for a light lunch. We ordered the spicy tuna roll and the spider roll. I thought both were average and far from the best I have had. I honestly haven't found any sushi in Cleveland that I am absolutely crazy about. It did look like they had some great lunch specials if you are hungrier than we were. Some of the pictures on here look great, so I will have to come back and try something different!"}
{"text":"Pacific East in Solon is not much different rom Pacific East in Cleveland.  Fair quality, gigantic portions, and fair prices.

The boyfriend and I found ourselves in Solon running errands for a friend, and decided to grab dinner there.  Maybe we were in the wrong part of town, but dinner options seem to be a bit limited in Solon.  We chose Pacific East because we love sushi and because we had a decent experience at the Cleveland location.

Upon first entering the establishment, we were turned off by the intense fishy smell.  It was seriously overpowering....I wanted to turn around and leave, but the boyfriend convinced me to stay.  The place was completely empty except for two other customers.  It appears that this location used to be a Wendy's or Roy Roger's, or some other fast-food joint.  It has those curved windows that you often see at said establishments.  The decor inside was pretty plain.

Service was friendly and prompt.  Our water glasses were kept full and our server repeatedly checked in to see if we needed anything.  I suppose this is a benefit of dining in an empty restaurant.

For our meal, we chose to split the \"Bridge for Two\" which contains 14 pieces of nigiri, 22 pieces of sashimi, a spicy tuna roll, and a California roll.  It is served with house salad and miso soup for two as well.  Total cost?  $50.  The miso soup was a tad on the salty side, but still flavorful.  The salad was the typical salad you get a sushi restaurants: iceburg, cucumber, tomato, and ginger dressing.

When our \"bridge\" arrived, it was beautifully presented.  The sushi chef obviously took pride in the presentation.  The amount of fish on it was actually a bit daunting.  The chef did not skimp on the cuts of fish.  The fish on the nigiri was literally hanging off both ends of the rice.  The sashimi was cut into huge slices.  The rolls were completely stuffed with goodies.  I normally don't even like rolls, but I devoured these without a problem.  We were hardly able to finish the entire meal, but didn't want to waste good food, so we made ourselves uncomfortably full.  It was worth it.

The quality of the fish was good, but not great.  While we had much variety, some of the fish seemed a bit dull.  None of it tasted bad by any means, just not as fresh and flavorful as it could have been.  I was quite pleased that the fish was served at the perfect temperature, too.

Would I go out of my way to grab sushi here?  No, probably not.  But it's good, especially for the area."}
{"text":"The food is great sushi rolls where the fish is the star! The portions are generous & tasty. They have moved to the top of my sushi spots. Try the specials the the sushi pizza is not on the menu but it's oh so good."}
{"text":"We decided to have dinner here while visiting the area with my husband.  What a mistake!  Looked lovely from the outside, terrible on the inside!  The tables were cramped,  very small interior.  It was more fitting of a Chinese take out.  I love sushi, but this place was enough to make me never eat it again.  The sushi was the worst I have ever had.  The waitress was  completely unfriendly, never offered water refills and never asked how our meals were.....maybe she knew.  We had to pay full price for a hibachi steak dinner for our six year old daughter  because they did not have a childrens menus...really?  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Visited recently for lunch. Was not impressed. The restaurant was cramped and servers were harried and not friendly. Miso soup tasted bland and the salad was just bagged romaine lettuce topped with a so so ginger dressing. The sushi was served on somewhat warm plate - gross. The maki rolls were just average, and sashimi was cut wrong and was nearly frozen in the middle. Expected better for the price and location."}
{"text":"The food was simply mediocre. The menu was limited, but that wasn't the problem. The problem was that it took us 30 minutes to be seated, then an hour and a half to get our food. This could of been because it was a Friday night, however it still was not ideal."}
{"text":"I have eatten at the Coventry location and Eton location many many times. Hands down this is the best Sushi in Cleveland. The fish is fresh and delicious. 

What to avoid? The tuna is B+ at best. Sushi pizza is not for the purists. This place gets packed at prime time, so try and go 30 minutes early or whatever works best for you.

What to get? They get the BEST fresh salmon. It s on par with the best sushi I have had in NY, Chicago, San Francisco and LA. The spicy tuna rolls are excellent. These days I eat the Avocado rolls and they are still satisfyling. The Escalor is AMAZING. I have heard it is an unhealthy fish, but it is so good you have to indulge at least once, ok twice.

What else? The hot food is good, filling soups and my kids like the grilled salmon. The appetizers are good and the presentation is nice. Service is good and the owners are kind people. The original chef at the coventry location used to work at Nobu in NY and it shows. They put the love into their food.

If you are going to eat fish, this is the place to do it!"}
{"text":"It's in such a convenient location and the food is very good, but the service is just absurdly slow and that's the reason for the low review. Every time I visit Pacific East, without fail, I end up waiting an extremely long time for food to come out, and that negates the fact that the sushi is very fresh, and sides like the miso soup and seaweed salad are pretty good as well. With better service, Pac East would be one of my favorite Japanese spots in Cleveland."}
{"text":"By far the yummiest sushi in Cleveland. The maki rolls are huge -- at least 1.5-2 times the size of those from nearby Sushi Rock. (Ironically, these larger rolls are also cheaper at Pacific East!) The fish is always very fresh; the service always fantastic...and very kind. Craving sushi? You truly cannot go wrong with a trip to Pacific East."}
{"text":"If this review was based on food alone, it would have been 4 stars easily. The sushi is always fresh and nicely done. But this is a warning to not go here on a Saturday night and expect to be treated well. We were directly told that takeout orders were being prioritized before us and ended up waiting over an hour for our meals, with no proactive updates or context. So we will likely not eat here in the future, seeing as they care more about takeout. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food and good prices. What else needs to be said.

They had some very good rolls that I have not seen done at other sushi places. This is a great spot for lunch or anytime you need to get your sushi fix in!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. The chef has excellent knife skills. I do not like getting maki that has small pieces and then pieces you can't fit into your mouth. Makes for a difficult lunch.
Service was good and the fish was fresh. My only complaint is they go a bit overboard with the sauces. A lot of places do this. I need to remember this and order light sauce. I should probably just order eel and a side of siracha and just shut up."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great presentation.  Sushi the way it is meant to be.  Good service.  We always stop here when in the area."}
{"text":"If your looking for excellent sushi in the greater Cleveland area this is the place to go. They also serve a variety of other great Japanese dishes for those in your party who are squeamish about sushi."}
{"text":"I and friend come here first time. Not many people here. The dishes are delicious. Especially the beef rice noodle is very good. My friend took it home for leftover. He told me it is still delicious too.
The nuts chicken which called kongbao chicken on menu is not good as my imagination ."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate here for the first time, this past weekend.  I am definitely a fan!!   We went on a Saturday evening and the place was pretty full, so we sat at the Sushi Bar.  

The menu offered lots of sushi and non-sushi choices.   We opted for the combo option.  1, 2, or 3 sushi rolls + miso soup and salad.   I am not a big fan of miso soup, but was able to sub the shiitake mushroom soup for a $2 upcharge (well worth it).  The salad was fresh and dressed with ginger dressing.  The soup was fragrant and full of mushrooms, charred garlic cloves and onions.   Now on to the star of the evening...the SUSHI.   I ordered the shrimp tempura, tuna and california rolls.....each roll was bursting with fresh veggies and also a bit larger than other places that I've been.  My daughter had the chicken tempura (unconventional...we know:-) and the california roll.   We truly enjoyed our meals and also enjoyed sitting at the sushi bar, watching orders being prepared.   Both meals totaled $44, what a deal!

We will definitely re-visit....soon!!"}
{"text":"After some time I thought I'd give it a try. Horrible service. People have to be trained in customer service"}
{"text":"The sushi here is fantastic.  I'm not sure where they get all of their fresh seafood from, but it is some of the highest quality I've had in a very long time.  Coming from Los Angeles, I would like to think that I know my sushi/sashimi, and this restaurant is top notch.  

I brought my friend here, who has traveled all throughout Asia, and whenever he comes to visit, all he wants to do is grab a meal here.  

The prices are standard.  The lunch specials are priced very competitively.  Let's put it this way, you won't go away hungry at lunch.  They have a great selection of cooked and raw foods.  

Some people have complained about the decor and how the orange walls and 2 paintings on the walls are boring.  But that is not the point of this restaurant.  The service is great.  The food arrives quickly after ordering.  And most importantly, the fish is FRESH.  

If you want sushi, come here."}
{"text":"First of all, let me say that I'm a sushi junkie:) and I never leave reviews, but I have created an account to leave a review here. I have been coming here for years. This is not a fancy restaurant with decorations, etc. but if you know the difference between a sushi rice and just rice, fresh fish that is perfect for sushi and just fish.. This is the place to go. Besides great food and may be the major reason we are coming here is waitress and the cook: Wen and Pen. Waitresses like Wen is the reason for the restaurant's success. Even though the food is great- it's not the same experience without her. She is above amazing! She remembers every little detail about your order and makes you and your friends and relatives feel special every time, after 15 years. I was observing her with first time customers, and she is amazing as well with every customer! Pen is the main cook and he is great as well. Without him, the quality wouldn't be the way it is! Love this place! And I hope Wen and Pen never quit:)"}
{"text":"You can't really beat the sushi lunch special here:

-Miso Soup
-Salad with ginger dressing
-Two rolls 
-$9.95

I alway gets the California roll and the spicy tuna roll. Compared to other sushi joints, there rolls are decent in size and the fish is fresh. They also, unless I get lucky, don't charge for spicy mayo. 

Pro-Tip: You can order the spicy tuna roll with the tuna in 'chunks' or 'blended'. If you order the blended (how it's served here), the spicy mayo is blended into the roll and not placed on top of the sushi."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a slow and snowy Saturday. We stopped and in got a table right away since it was us and one other group. Despite all of that, Eton parking always manages to be a disaster. I can never figure out where all of these people are but the parking lot is always full and the mall is empty.

The sushi here is very good. The Xmas Roll is particularly festive and quite delicious. The Philadelphia Roll is one of the best I've had.

The prices on the Coventry web site (since the Eton web site is broken) are either not the same or it is badly out of date (and the reviews from 2002 suggest it is outdated). Most of the rolls were $1 more than what the web site shows. That moves them from \"screaming deal\" to \"slightly better than elsewhere\".

The decor is a bit run down and certainly not modern like the typical sushi bar.

I would come back if I was in the area and hungry. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, though. The parking and quality aren't worth saving $0.50/plate over some of the better options."}
{"text":"Excellent Sushi. We've tried 3 other sushi places in the area and this serves the best quality. Bit on the pricey side. Minus 1 star for getting our take-out order wrong a multiple occasions!"}
{"text":"Wow, where to start.  This was a startlingly bad sushi experience.  I ordered a simple sushi deluxe platter.  The texture of all of the fish was tough and stringy.  The fish was cut way too thick, and was far too large for the bed of rice it was served on.  Other than the eel, the fish all tasted eerily similar too.  I didn't realize that was possible.

About that rice.  Good lord. I didn't detect a single shred of evidence that this was prepared in a sushi style.  It was basically what you get shoved into a little white box when you order takeout from your local Hunan Wok.  

I honestly don't know if I've ever eaten a smaller percentage of a plate of food that was put in front of me, as my standards tend to dip pretty low when I'm hungry.

The waitress was a sweet little girl and I actually couldn't bring myself to look her in the eye when she came to ask how everything was going. Her cheerful attitude was probably the sole redeeming quality other than maybe the miso soup?

2 stars only because everyone's attitude, and the soup were high points."}
{"text":"I am not a typical customer for sushi.  I don't eat seafood.  That is probably why I love Pacific East so much.  They have the largest selection for veggie sushi out of any restaurant I know.

I especially love the sweet potato roll, avocado roll, and even though it isn't on the menu anymore, they will still make a Shitake roll for you."}
{"text":"We are regulars at Pacific East especially for takeout, especially. The get our order right every time, prices are reasonable and I think the sushi is pretty darn good. I have learned to ask for certain sushi like spicy tuna \"chuncky\". I like it better because I still get the texture of the fish and I don't think it is pre-chopped and mixed with the the spices, so it is fresher. I also really like the negamaki appetizer."}
{"text":"Don't you just love strip shopping malls?  Yeah, me either.  But make an exception for this Pacific East, slipped into the front side of Eton Square, under what seem to be either a bunch of offices or merely love nest studios, for harried, trysting executives.  Either way, it makes for some hellish parking and an entirely whacked-out bunch of shops, restaurants, a yoga studio and what may or may not have been a metal stamping plant.  

Great sushi.  As has already been covered in other reviews, theirs is among the best you will find this far from salt water.  Service is attentive, prices and portions are both in better proportion than most other high-end places around Cleveland, and the grub gets to table quickly.

The one-star deduction:  The place just ain't that pretty.  When we stopped in to make reservations, after walking through the grand columns and entry door, I assumed there may be two or more dining rooms, perhaps a nice bar/lounge area... Nope.  One pretty small dining room.  NO bar.  (No booze, either, just beer and wine.)  I guess the rental costs on this particular shopping strip must be pretty steep, hence the diner-sized table area.

We'll try out their Solon spot, soon.  So far, the Coventry location would be our first recommendation, though.

{"text":"I liked Pacific East so much on my previous visit that I came home wrote a 5 Yelp review and was back 4 days later with a friend.  Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed.  Instead of the more traditional hot Japanese dishes, we ordered sushi.  

As before the shrimp tempura roll was excellent, however, I tried the spicy tuna roll and tuna roll which were for lack of a better word gargantuan. I rarely complain about too much of anything, but in this case, too much!!!  The spicy tuna roll was just packed with tuna which would shoot out the side as I tried to take a bite.  Putting the whole roll in my mouth was not an option as the roll was just too bulky.  

My friend ordered the chirashi (a variety of raw sliced fish over a bed of sushi rice) however even he said that he became a little disgusted by the presentation.  Picture eating heavy thick slabs of raw fish over rice.  Slabs vs slices are an important detail.   

The tragic thing is that the sushi is fresh and flavor is good, but the proportions are just so out of control and there is nothing graceful or delicate about these rolls."}
{"text":"So good !!!! Sooo fresh!! A longtime favorite of mine and my family. Everything is amazing. I've never ever been disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has some pretty good lunch specials. I came here a few times for lunch and left happy. I usually get the 2 maki roll combo which includes miso soup and salad. You can choose from rolls like tuna, salmon, eel, Philadelphia, Boston, California, veggie and a few others. The soup and salad is typical of a Japanese restaurant. The rolls are average/above average. This lunch option is pretty filling and unbeatable for $10.

The service is pretty quick and staff is friendly. Only complaint is that it can be hard to find parking during lunch time. Will definitely return for dinner and see how their dinner menu fairs."}
{"text":"Yum. Some of the best sushi around. A little different than the Coventry location, but the same great stuff. Go."}
{"text":"Had a drinks and a couple rolls.  My wife ordered one of the specials on the board, the JJ roll, I believe.  Tuna, avocado, etc. - pretty good roll.  I ordered the Bomb Roll.  While the lobster and crab meat were very good, the cucumber wrap was too much.  Would've lied it much better if the cucumber were a small part of the roll.  My wife also ordered the Chuka Ika (squid) salad.  It came on top of a bed of iceberg lettuce, which was a bit of a surprise.  We'll come back for a larger meal at some point, but I'm still looking for a GREAT sushi place in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on recommendation from my boss. Got the sushi lunch and was very impressed. You get soup, salad, 1 California roll and 4 pieces of sashimi. The pieces of sashimi were huge and for $10.99 I walked out of there stuffed. Will definitely be  back."}
{"text":"I second Caroline C.'s notion of sloppily made, over sized sushi rolls. 

After thoroughly enjoying the spicy salmon and x'mas rolls at the Coventry location, I thought I'd give the Solon location a shot...expecting to receive the same rolls. Unfortunately, the quality of the tuna differed, as did the proportions of rice (so much rice!), Many of the rolls were so loosely prepared that they fell apart when dipped in soy sauce. I also tried the Boston Roll, which was good in theory, but way larger than I could consume in one bite."}
{"text":"Tried the bento lunch box multiple times. Comes with a clear soup, salad, choice of meat and sushi. This dish has an excellent balance nutrition wise. Great service too!"}
{"text":"This was really bad. Yellow tail was bitter, tuna was not fresh. King crab roll was something that you would get at a Chinese buffet.  Shumai came out of a box."}
{"text":"I can't sing enough praises for Pacific East on Chagrin.

Best. 

Sushi.

In Cleveland.

Nevermind the small dining area. Nevermind the sometimes long wait for your food.  This is the best sushi you can wrap your chopsticks around. As stated in my previous review, you absolutely have to try the Manhattan Roll. One bite of the impeccable combination of spicy shrimp, tempura crunch, nori, rice, and smooth avocado brought together by the creamy seafood sauce (which is liquid CRACK) will turn anyone into a believer.

BUT, the real reason I am updating my review is because I recently discovered the Empire Roll, which gives the Manhattan a run for its money. It consists of spicy tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and tempura crunch held together with a thin, soft rice paper and covered with 4 different sauces. This gigantic roll (and believe me, it is huge, in both individual size and the amount of pieces) delivers a massive combination attack to your palate that will leave your appetite fully satisfied and down for the count. I now have my top two must-haves every time I go to Pacific East.

Simple rolls more to your liking? They've got it covered. Their sushi/sashimi menu is diverse, and everything I've tried is fresh, delectable, and of course, HUGE, so you know you are getting your money's worth."}
{"text":"The sushi is great here and the chefs are top notch, just sit at the bar and watch them have fun making edible works of art.  Beautiful and delicious.  They get at least 4 stars.  The room, the location and service are unfortunately lacking, so sadly 3 stars.  Consider take out.

I love Pacific East and have been going to their locations since right at their beginning on Coventry when they first opened and we could bring our own wine bottles before they had their liquor license.  It was an oasis for sushi fans, and we were the only ones there!

Today, with this location and others to maintain in this small and great local chain, they are struggling to balance the yin and yang.  The struggle is real.

There is palpable stress from the aloof or absent servers, when a simple smile and pleasant greeting makes the whole room bigger (which it physically isn't).

Working against all this is the underlying fact that this Pacific East is in the middle of an (over) glorified strip mall, while the edges would be MUCH better.  Unfortunately, also their signage is nearly invisible day or night, in comparison to their neighbors.  I have walked past it and drove past it more than once.

TL;DR:  get the take out, it is awesome!"}
{"text":"Favorite local sushi restaurant on the east side. I love love love their spicy tuna. Service can be a little eh, but consistently good."}
{"text":"This Pacific East is a good Japanese option on the East Side.

I, like many of my fellow reviewers, prefer the Coventry location to this one. There are a few reasons for this, in my opinion. The Eton location offers a smaller Japanese menu and no Malaysian menu. The Eton location is also very small, and can get swamped on weekends and during peak lunch hours (just like the other Eton restaurants). Because this restaurant is so small, they tend to only have two or three servers on staff, so the service can get a bit slow.

All that being said, the food here is delicious, and is a better Japanese restaurant than most others on the East Side! One of my favorite dishes to order here are Hamachi kama appetizer, which is a grilled, rich and fatty yellowtail collar. Another favorite of mine is the Chirashi, which has several different kinds of sashimi over a bed of rice and pickled vegetables. A chirachi lunch is a particularly good deals, since it comes with miso soup, a salad, and the entree for about $13.

My conclusion: This Pacific East location is second only to it sister on Coventry! Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Been to this Pacific East twice.  I really like this location.  It's nice and clean and the food and service are both great.  For Cleveland, I think the price and quality of the sushi is excellent.  I recommend the seaweed salad to share.  I've had the sashimi and a few of the rolls (Ichiban, Spicy Hamachi, others I can't remember...). I thought they were all tasty.  It also has way better service than the Pacific East on Coventry. I've found the Coventry location to be hit or miss with the food as well.  Also if you're willing to pay the price and want great sushi, I suggest you check out Ginko in Tremont.

Overall, Pacific East Eton is my go to place for good quality sushi at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I have ever had! Truly one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. The place is a little small, but the service and food make up for it. I love the Rainbow Roll and my fiancé loves all of the teriyaki's!"}
{"text":"Sushi?  But there's no ocean for 1000 miles!

Not bad for inland sushi.  The boat for 4 is quite filling, with a cornucopia of sashimi and negiri."}
{"text":"Quick reminder that 3-stars is not a bad thing.  \"A-OK\" is what it says.  And that's what Pacific East was last night.  The food was 4 stars and the overall experience was 2.

My first impression upon walking in was \"what a dump.\"  I was really disappointed in this.  We were led without greeting by a host that seemed to be under an exceptional amount of stress (despite the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty at 6:30pm on NYE) to a table on a nondescript wall.  Not just nondescript, but in bad shape.  There were huge gouges in the wall, and they were not fresh.  There wasn't a single thing on the wall other than orange paint.  I felt like I was in a warehouse.  A poorly maintained warehouse.

Our food came relatively quickly, and for the most part, it was delicious.  I had two complaints on the food.  One, in the Empire Roll, which is 3 different kinds of fish and 4 different kinds of sauce, the fish was a paste.  Maybe I should've known this because it was \"spicy X, Y and Z\" as in \"spicy tuna\" but what is the point of having 3 kinds of fish if they're going into a blender?  Also, the futomaki are just too big.  Sushi etiquitte demands popping the whole thing in or biting it clean in two, and neither is really possible.  I ate them whole, but I looked ridiculous and felt ridiculous.  The flavors were all good to great.  The fish quality was very good.  The \"steak\" in the Land and Sea roll is not steak.  It is roast beef from the grocery deli.  FYI.

My other huge complaint was the gaggle of teenaged girls at the table next to us.  Two of them were dressed like whores.  One was showing 2 inches of thong out of her ridiculous and inappropriate outfit, and the other had a skirt that had a half inch inseam.  The others were way too done up for 16 year olds, and they were obnoxious.  Loud conversations about which ones of them had had sex.  Lots of high fiving.  One of their daddies must be a regular because they had several things delivered on the house.  This is the future of our country.

Unfortunately, the other clientele is part of the experience.  And this experience was merely A-OK.  I'll stick with Shuhei where the decor, if a bit aged, is at least well kempt, and where most of the futomaki is better composed and manageable to eat."}
{"text":"Last attempt to dine here.  Service is horrible.  Need to track down the server for every need, including to order.  This is the only sushi restaurant that you don't speak to the sushi chef when you sit at the sushi bar?  Strange?  Also, all rolls fall apart easily.  Issue with sticky rice.  Prices are high and value is low!"}
{"text":"I couldn't be happier with the quality service, great price and huge portions. I ordered the 3 roll combo and it's a deal nobody can beat! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the combo option. 2 delicious sushi rolls, salad, and miso soup for less than $15.

I'll come back at some point for one of those awesome bridges and boats that I always see but, some days, you just gotta have those sushi staples."}
{"text":"Sorry to report that I think they've closed. Bummer.  This was a great place."}
{"text":"Overall: The sushi is surprisingly good and prices are reasonable.  If they had a larger interior space, I'd give it 5 stars.

Food: 5 stars.  Surprisingly good.  I've had sushi at many different places, and the quality was very high and fresh.  The sushi is the best I've had in Cleveland by far.  The sushi portions were very large and had a generous amount of fish.  The miso soup and seaweed salad were also very good.  The edamame was adequate; I'd recommend they grill and add some flavoring. 

Prices: 4 stars.  The sushi is reasonably priced at $5-8 for a 6 piece Maki roll and $10-15 for a large 8-10 piece roll.  Miso is $3.

Location/Interior: 3 stars.  The location is at Eaton Place, which makes it difficult to find parking.  After parking, I had a hard time finding their restaurant, and calling the hostess via phone wasn't much help since they couldn't adequately describe their location.  The restaurant itself is very small and the tables are pushed together.  They definitely need a larger location.

Service: 4 stars.  The server was friendly, helpful with the order and attentive to requests."}
{"text":"I just recently discovered this Pacific East location.  I'd been to the Coventry location before and found the food to be good but the atmosphere was a little lacking.

This location is clean, bright, and doesn't smell like fish.  Hooray!  (If you've been to the Coventry location, you know what I'm referring to)  It makes the slightly higher prices well worth it.  (and these slightly higher prices are still waaaay less than...um...some of the other trendy sushi places around town)

I ordered a mountain of vegetarian sushi - cucumber, squash, radish, avocado, yamagobo, and a mixed roll - and they were all delicious.  I ordered take-out, so I can't really comment on the service, but the person who took my order and packaged my meal was very friendly and nice.  I can't wait to go back and sit down to enjoy a nice meal!"}
{"text":"I always get the same thing *curry seafood fried rice* and it is always great! Decent taro boba and the shrimp and Japanese sweet potato tempura are  10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"So the food here is usually very good.  When we lived in the area, we ordered from here often.  When we were back in town for a few days, we decided to order out sushi for a group of us on a Sunday later in the evening (around 7:00pm).  We ordered a large order, the 'King & Queen\" so the order didn't have specific items....all chosen by the chef.  The only specific thing we requested was no sesame due to an allergy.  They said no problem.

The sushi got picked up by someone, so they really didn't know to look.  When we got it back to the house we noticed right away there was sesame over every roll and was probably in some cases on the sashimi and nigiri.  I called to let them know what had happened, and the answer I got was that the chef didn't look at the ticket.  They said to bring it back but we had 7 people who had been waiting for food, and live 15 minutes away.  We weren't going to wait another 45 minutes.  When I suggested that maybe he take something off the bill, he refused.  I was a little shocked.  

While I realize it is a mistake, they really did nothing to make it right other than suggest we inconvenience ourselves.  The sushi is fine, but at this point, whenever I am back in the area, I will be looking for other options."}
{"text":"You're upsetting me, Pacific East. Just really fast and easy with the service. Rolls are getting loose. You're getting the qualities of a significant other I never want..."}
{"text":"This is the more expensive location of the original located on Coventry. But they do not disappoint. The Sushi is always fresh as well as the appetizers cooked well. Surprisingly it is harder to park at this location then the one on Coventry due to the shopping center always being crowded and limited parking unless you go to the creepy garage."}
{"text":"This location does take second place when compared to the Coventry location. However, it is still Pacific East which makes it my personal favorite place to get sushi. I have never liked miso soup, so I can't speak to that. However, the sushi rolls do not disappoint. Large pieces of delicious, fresh tasting fish, the rice texture is always perfect, and generally good service. I recommend their lunchtime maki combo for the best deal! Be sure to try their Alaska roll if you enjoy salmon- it's the best."}
{"text":"I was living in the area when this location opened, and was glad to see that it did...my previous best option for quck-access sushi was Sushi Rock. So...yea.

I'll get the gripes out of the way first...the hosts (owners?) always seemed a bit off to me. Like the time we walked in during a weeknight, with two tables occupied, and were given grief for not having a reservation. I dunno...maybe because getting a reservation at a restaurant, in the Cleveland suburbs, on a Tuesday, is utterly pointless? And, as illustrated by this current situation, totally unnecessary? Try smiling and being happy that you have customers...it helps!

Ok, that out of the way, the sushi chefs at the bar were always great. Not the best I've ever experienced but better than many. The food itself was good-not-great, never bad, and adventurous enough. 

I heard that the Coventry location was better (and cheaper), but alas I never got to stop by in my brief Cleveland adventure. I suppose this location fell victim to the \"Eton\" experience (vomit). As far as restaurants in this area go, Taza is the king, and all others are but humble serfs."}
{"text":"I like the one in Coventry more, but this one is a little closer to my house.

This place is styled a bit fancier than the one in Cleveland Heights.  I will say that this location seems to be louder and the tables feel like they're squeezed close together.  It was too easy for me to hear other people's distracting conversation and it often would disrupt my train of thought when speaking with my sister who sat directly in front of me."}
{"text":"My co workers and I were looking for a local Mexican place to celebrate Cinco De Mayo, WHAT A BUST!!! I totally forgot that I was in Cleveland. The one local place that they have was so ridiculously crowded that we decided to pass. Then one of my co workers was very insistent that we eat Sushi.  I initially SQUIRMED but decided to GO WITH THE FLOW.  The last time I had sushi in the eastside of Cleveland, I was very disappointed.  We ended up at Pacific East and were seated promptly.

I did a quick glance of the place and it looked clean.  It had a more conservative feel to it based on who was in there and formal intimate vibe that I got.  When I grabbed the menu, I expected the place to have overpriced sushi (we are in the old money part of town).  My gut instincts were TOTALLY WRONG.   

I chose to eat a 15 piece Sashimi meal for $21.  This started with three pieces of Salmon, Albacore, and Mackerel. Then it included two pieces of raw sweet shrimp, white fish, and white tuna.  Why did this not add up to 15? Well, I am not complaining.  The fish pieces were bigger than average and very fresh (exception was the Mackerel).   I left SATISFIED and curious about how the rest of their fish selection would taste like.  

Would I come back? In terms of finding a good sushi in Cleveland, this is a good spot.  I will definitely come back here, but it's just a matter of when I will be back for business."}
{"text":"Always busy but there is always a table available.  Always something different to explore on the menu.  Servers give great recs.  Note: in the winter the far dining room is very cold!"}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago, some friends of ours suggested we pick up some sushi and have a take-out feast at their house. We picked the Woodmere Pacific East as it's on the way to their place. I didn't really feel like picking each individual roll, etc. but when I called, the lady was super helpful. She just asked what sort of fish we liked/didn't like and a price range, and said the chef would just make a tray for us. This sounded awesome to (lazy) me. 

When we got there to pick it up, it was ready right on time. And the sushi chef personally thanked us for letting him have fun with the tray. The sushi was very good quality, and the proportion of fish in the rolls was generous. Although not the best sushi I've ever had, it was MUCH better than Sushi Rock, was very satisfying and a good value. 

A very do-able option for eastside sushi, and although I've never eaten in the restaurant, I wouldn't hesitate to try it."}
{"text":"My husband and I were out on the east side a couple of weeks ago, and we did some looking around on Yelp to determine where we would grab lunch. We decided on Pacific East because I knew I would have options as a vegan who has been on a huge veg sushi kick lately. 

First, the interior of the restaurant was really awful - for being in a nice shopping plaza, the entire place felt off. It was small, dated, and cheap looking. I usually don't care about this kind of thing, but it was not what I expected at all. 

My iced green tea had a fishy taste to it. That did not set a good tone for the meal. The miso soup and salad both tasted off to us as well. I usually really enjoy miso soup, but I couldn't eat more than a couple of bites. My sushi rolls were just okay and my husband felt the same way about his chicken teriyaki meal. It was the kind of meal that made me wonder if I was going to have stomach issues later on in the day. 

I would NOT return and I would NOT recommend it. We were really disappointed."}
{"text":"Always good food, good price.    Not the fanciest place, but exerpience is always good.    Even to go food is always packed up neatly, nicely and always accurate.    Would deinitely reccomend."}
{"text":"Hostess was rude and inattentive, however our waiter was fantastic! Food wasn't the best I've ever had, but edible."}
{"text":"Pacific east is excellent for it's convenient location and reasonable prices. The place always has customers and a great ambiance. The sushi is very fresh, and the lunch menu is perfect - 3 rolls, soup, and salad for around $15. Take out is perfect if you're on the go - overall, great family-run business."}
{"text":"One of the better Japanese restaurants in the area.  Two criticisms- they need to cook the onions longer for the bento box items and the water for the hot tea is insanely too hot.  You can't even it drink it for a good 10 minutes.  Staff is friendly and the service is prompt.  The Coventry location has a better menu."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey for sushi that falls apart and doesn't taste that good."}
{"text":"Okay, this sushi was incredible. I frequent B spot and was actually going to go there for dinner but the wait was long so I left. As I was walking to my car, I passed this gem and decided to try it. I am SO glad I did! 

I was starved when I got there so I had to order an appetizer. I got the Yozu Tuna I believe it's called. I do not like roe and did not realize it came on top so I spooned that off BUT regardless it was delicious. The grapefruit flavor with the tuna was delicious and unexpected. Then I ordered two rolls - the Westfield Roll and the Manhattan Roll. Both of which were amazing. The Manhattan Roll I'd say is generally better but I could have done without the mass amount of sauce on top. I LOVED the Westfield Roll. ..  the spicy tuna was incredible. The tuna there is excellent compared to other places. Plus, the rolls are HUGE. Like really really huge. I ate probably half of each roll and took some to -go. This place is a million time better than sushi rock and much much more clean. The sushi also doesn't take forever. 

My service was also very good. The place was pretty jam packed but I was able to order my appetizer and meal promptly (probably helped I was by myself) and was attended to very often. I cannot wait to go back and try some other things off the delicious looking menu!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi place in Cleveland!! The sushi is always so fresh and the service is always great! I also have never had a Spicy Tuna or a Philadelphia that tastes as great as theirs!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place before I moved to town and definitely didn't disappoint. Freshest sushi I've ever had. And really good service (for a sushi place). I can't wait to try out the original. But the color of the tuna and salmon were second to none. Sushi done right! Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"It was okay, service was pretty good, but I wasn't overly impressed with the food. Maybe I didn't order the right thing, but it was a pretty simple stir-fry, but was not especially flavorful."}
{"text":"I don't know if it smelled fishy as someone else said. Maybe I smell bad and just don't know. This is one of my favorite places to go for lunch. They have a special called \"Lunch Box\" and it really continues to make me happy. It comes with a side of chicken or salmon in a teriyaki or other kind of sauce, four pieces of california roll, miso soup, rice and a spring roll. All of this for $8.50. Or you can get two kinds of sushi rolls for $6.95. The staff there is really friendly every time."}
{"text":"This place serves great quality food and it's just delicious.  My husband and I were seated promptly and drink orders were immediately taken.  The staff is extremely patient, kind and knowledgeable.  There were able to answer all of my questions and even offered suggestions catered to my taste.

The sushi is fantastic.  Why 4 stars if I was so impressed?  I wish their menu as a bit more detailed.  I felt I would not have had to ask so many questions if there were more descriptive with their items.  Mostly on the sushi.  Their soups were fantastic and well described, although I wasn't sure what the base of their broth was.  It didn't taste like Miso, but it didn't take vegi based either.  

Overall, the esthetics were great.  The place was clean and neat.  The service was top notch.  I can't complain on anything.  Yes, it's pricey, but I'd go back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place!  We have tried every sushi restaurant in Cleveland and this is by far our favorite. The staff is always wonderful, great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials and super fresh fish.  I had the shrimp tempura lunch, which was a generous size for the price and came with tempura vegetables, soup, salad and rice.  Add some hot sauce, and it was great!  

My boyfriend got the sushi and sashimi box and it was great.  Large prices of fresh fish, a california roll, and soup and salad as well.  

I just wish they had the Malaysian menu here like they do in Coventry."}
{"text":"Two stars is probably being generous.

I've been a customer for a couple of years, primarily because of it's  proximity to Pepper Pike, and will never visit this place again after my experience this evening.

To echo other reviews, parking at Eton is horrific, the manager (assuming that the rude, uncaring woman at the hostess stand is indeed the manager)  and waitstaff are less than interested in your business, and the food/sushi is poorer quality than the location in Coventry (presumably operated by a different part of the family that cares about service and food quality).

This evening I managed to arrive at a time where there was room at the sushi bar, but was told that there would be at least a half-hour wait for a chair (?). Upon pointing out that there were empty chairs at some of the tables, I was informed that they weren't available for the sushi bar. 

After digesting this news for a few minutes and taking mental count of empty chairs, (5), I decided to leave for the location on Coventry.  

To leave with a quote from a previous review - \"We'll im fed up with this location and have decided NEVER AGAIN. If you are reading this, dont be lazy and drive your tush over to the pacific east on coventry where the hostesses are much friendlier and food worth eating. \"

Amen, brother."}
{"text":"very good sushi on the east side. Definitely in my top 5 in Cleveland."}
{"text":"To be fair, my review is based upon carry out experiences only. 

I have gotten carry out 3 separate times and have not been disappointed. The sushi wash fresh, rolls were tight (lose rolls fall apart), and flavorful. 

I will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Traveling through the area, I was looking for something that I had not had in a while and prayed that it would be delicious: sushi came to mind. 

Saw this place while driving down Chagrin and decided to stop for lunch.  I sat at the bar. The service was very attentive and everyone was very friendly. 

I ordered the Sushu & Sashimi Lunch Special. The fish was very fresh and really good. The rice was also soft and a little sticky the way that it is supposed to be. It was all very delicious.  The sashimi was cut thick and the sushi was also cut thick and the portions were both fresh and generous. 

The only complaint that I have is that fresh, raw fish should be served cold. Although everything was still delicious, the fish was a bit closer to room temperature and that took away from the experience. However, all in all, it is probably one of the better sushi places that I have eaten at in a long time. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this place. Great authentic sushi! My favorite roll would be the Manhattan roll. Everything is fresh and the staff is very nice. It is a small and cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wow, there are so many amazing things about this restaurant. Aside from the delicious sushi to noodle dishes, the service was some of the best I've experienced. Especially the super cool awesome waiters, shoutout to Gavin!!!! If you're in the area there's also so many cool shops, including my fave Trader Joe's, in the area so if you need to walk off all that food there's plenty to do!"}
{"text":"This place has really good sushi but it is kind of expensive. 

The people are nice and they'll bring you an extra deep dish if you want to totally submerge your nigiri in soya sauce. Here's a trick you can try: ask for an extra gob of the green horseradish sauce which you swill around in your bowl. It dissolves and makes this sort of mud sauce that is hot and salty and will clobber you when you dip your raw fish in it. Its not like the horsey sauce at Arby's which is for less sophisticated palates than ours.

Another good idea to try when you're done and are really hungry, roll up some of those ginger slices and dunk them in your sauce and it just about tastes like sushi without that rubbery bite to it. You get the good taste and the punch in the palate without paying $2.50 for a bite of food.

I also like the freshwater eel that is cooked and has this brown unagi sauce on it and man is it good. I could eat these little bastards all night long providing I had infinite cash, infinite beer and was like running on a treadmill while I ate. No, that's weird. Forget that last part. 

Any of the specialty rolls are great too. You can get these giant rolls that take two bites to get one of the chunks down which can be a hassle but it is so good. I can't say enough good things about this place or the awesome sushi you can get here.

Don't be shy asking for extra condiments like ginger and green stuff because let's face it, a sushi chef in Solon doesn't really care if you're a connosieur or a face-jammer. Yours and my money works just like the guy's who pairs his sashimi with Asahi because the astringency of Sapporo interferes with the umami sensation of raw tuna.

Don't go there hungry, though or you'll be jonesing for a burger an hour later."}

For one, the parking is horrible. Unless you can snag a free space across the ways at the local shady market or shady gas stations, you can forget getting to this restaurant. (-1 point)

Even though I made a reservation for 5, we still had to wait at least 2 hours to be seated. This wasnt entirely their fault however. For one, we went on a Saturday night and two, my friend was handicapped so he needed specific seating. That certainly wasnt going to happen quickly especially since the place isnt wheel chair friendly. The interior is tight. I mean, VERY TIGHT. There is no passing on wheels without asking people to stand up and move their seat. I had to make my friend come in on his crutches. (-2 bad interior & bad for handicaps)

The service was great. I absolutely loved my waiter. I tipped her because she was so kind and sweet, not so much for the food. (+1)

OMG the food. I forgot the name of my dish, but what i ordered was rice and veggies. I guess i shouldn't have expected much. But damn. It was as bland as boxed mashed potatoes without seasoning nor butter. The rice was bland, the veggies were bland. I mean, Chipotle makes better rice and veggies then this place. My other friend ordered sushi which totaled 12.99. When he got his plate, he was pretty pissed to see that it was only 6 pieces of sushi and it didnt even look that special. You could buy that from giant eagle for half the price! (-1)

The highlight of the day was the Bubble Tea. They have the best bubble tea I have ever tasted in my entire life. Everyone got something different and i loved them all. (+1)  

Long story short, only come here for Bubble Tea then leave."}
