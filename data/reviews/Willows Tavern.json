{"text":"A little bar on the top of Lake Mendota that's been around for 40 years. They have a pretty robust liquor selection and make a damn fine Old Fashioned.  If you found yourself at this bar having no idea where you were, you could at least feel confidant you were in Wisconsin because:  * Wood paneling... everywhere  * TWO shuffleboard tables  * Fish Fry & Walleye breakfasts  * Meat raffle"}
{"text":"I live less than a mile away, and have went there 4 times in 10 years. Every time it is unfriendly, hostile or dank. Not a happy place. Hit any other bar in area."}
{"text":"The Willows Tavern is a bar; that said they have two pool tables for $1 per play and really good old fashioned's. Babe and I went there for a birthday party on Saturday afternoon. The BBQ ground beef and baked beans they provided were just plain good. The bar tenders were nice and the other patrons were amicable. Any place that is easy going filled with regular folks drinking libations and relaxing, deserves a minimum of 4 stars in my book."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a Sunday Bloody Mary and learned that they have a small kitchen, offering a monthly breakfast fish fry brunch on the last Sunday of the month and a  Friday night fish fry. I can't recall the frequency of the Friday night fish fry, but don't think it was weekly. The review was meant initially for the Bloody as I'd hoped to get a good small town version of this classic cocktail but I was disappointed. The bar itself was rebuilt a few years back and the patrons there were happy to tell us all about the history of the original building and the evolution of the current one. The bartender was a vibrant, highly energetic woman, full of character. I didn't get a look at the menu but while we were there we saw someone order a melty, grilled sandwich on marbled bread that looked pretty decent. Several patrons were busy playing pool, watching sports on the tv's and plugging some kind of gambling machines. This bar could most certainly hold a large number of people, there were lots of tables.   Cons: the Bloody Mary was made from Zing Zang, about the best premade mix out there but it's just that- a premade mix and NOT from scratch. No interesting goodies in the bloody.   Pros: $1.50 microbrew taps on Sunday!!! Whaaat?!? Yes! And my chaser was a full size 12 oz beer, fantastic. I also liked that my Bloody was in a short and not a pint glass. That's a personal pro, I recognize that."}
