{"text":"I came home after a long and stressful week  and to be surprised with an amazing dinner . Talk about knocking it out of the ballpark. The food my wife picked up from My Secret Kitchen was fresh tasty incredible ingredients and pleasure to the eyes. We are loyal and excited to enjoy are next meal. Amazing Amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Although off the highway a few miles, it was a breath of fresh air and well worth the drive to this culinary kitchen of delicious unique homemade salads and fresh specialty sandwiches and pastas. I had one of the specials: veal Parmesan sandwich on fresh-baked crusty bread. Homemade hot pepper sauce was offered and my husband loved it! I tried the smoked tomato jam on a cracker and bought a jar to take home. My don's chicken cutlet with homemade mashed potatoes was also a big hit, as were the delectable cookies and other caramel desserts. Friendly owner greeted us and made us feel very welcome. Would make a special stop there the next time going to Toronto."}

{"text":"Simply AMAZING. Ordered catering for my son's First Communion and My Greek mother thought the food was fantastic and that is all you need to know about how delicious the food is here!!!!!! Will use them again and again. Thank you My Secret Kitchen for helping me:)))"}
{"text":"A Plus place!  Beautiful food.  BEAUTIFUL!  Great prices!  GREAT!  Half price day old frozen entrees, best deal in town, ie 2 huge pieces of delish veal parm for $6!  DAILY if I could.  I only tried them once but can't wait to go back and try EVERYTHING!  MY SECRET KITCHEN IS MY NEW PLACE TO BE.  Fresh pasta and everything.  I haven't been this excited for food in a while."}
{"text":"I had My Secret Kitchen cater birthday party at my home for about 25 people. My five star rating says it all. First, Stephanie is amazing to deal with. She made some great suggestions and coordinating the details was super easy. Everything was delivered exactly the way we arranged. Now the food - let me just say WOW. We served the food - which was the perfect temperature - and I didn't even have a chance to try it before a friend came over to say, \"Have you tried the veal?? I had 5 pieces already!!\" I had to tell him to ease off the food so everyone else could fill their plates too. We went with \"The Italian\" with Italian relatives coming over. They were equally  impressed and several people wanted to know who the caterer was. I will say the veal was amazing, the chicken was delicious, and the pasta sauce was perfection. Quantities were generous. We got a couple of appetizers which were delicious as well. The next day my husband and I were thinking about what event we can have next just so we can use My Secret Kitchen to cater. Whatever it is, I will go with them for sure."}
{"text":"My Secret Kitchen has one of the largest selections of fresh and vegan salads in Port Credit. I would definitely recommend the raw zucchini noodles with the curry coconut mango dressing. The layers of sweet, salty, tangy, and spicy flavours made it refreshing. I ordered the grilled lemongrass chicken banh mi as well and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches, pasta and a variety of options to choose from. Stephanie (owner) is very friendly and puts customers first by maintaining delicious quality food! Definitely recommend checking this place out"}
{"text":"Just happened to passed by this shop and realize they just opened recently. The store is nicely layout and clean, they have a good selection of vegan/vegetarian options and if you are not vegetarian they also have quite a few selection of dishes and pre made entree with meat as well. I tried their zucchini salad, beat salad and their chickpea curry. They are all freshly made and with good flavour but the zucchini salad is the star. I will certainly return to try few more things and on the day when I'm in a hurry and just grab a pre made dinner. It is a little gem in the port credit area. Highly recommended."}
