{"text":"We're lucky that this family run sushi and ramen joint just opened up in the neighbourhood! The sashimi pieces are nice and big and the presentation of all their dishes is delightful! The service was friendly and prompt. Can't wait to try the ramen next!"}
{"text":"This is a real good place, my order was correct and the woman helping us was cute too, the prices are very good compared to the others with crowds, this is more hidden and calm, no canadian hipsters, family friendly, family owned, felt like i was back at home, i dont know what the other guy was crying about on his review, im glad i had to check this one out, also that other guy works for another sushi spot, so im sure he wants to destroy competition, thats not so friendly sir, either way, loved this place, check it out, thanks for all that sushi for a low price, gracias from mexico and usa"}
{"text":"April 25, 2018  I'm dating this review because, despite the one-star rating, I really, really want Cho's Sushi to succeed. I'm going to give it a month to get stuff figured out, then come back and hopefully edit my review to a much higher score.  Until then, I have to review Cho's Sushi based on my first visit there, which was an unmitigated disaster.   A timeline:  6:05: We arrive and seat ourselves.  6:10: We hear someone at the next table complain that they didn't order the dish that was brought to them.  6:15: The sole server comes to our table to take our order. We order three sushi rolls, a beef yakisoba, vegetable tempura, and a miso soup. As the server steps away from our table, she's intercepted by someone from another table, who tells her that their can of Coke is frozen solid.  6:16-6:38: Every five minutes, someone emerges from the back of the restaurant, hands a single dish to the server, gives her a lengthy explanation, then disappears into the kitchen. Our two young children watch mournfully as the server carries the dish past us to another table. Meanwhile, several takeout customers arrive.  6:39: Seafood yakisoba arrives. (We ordered beef.)  6:41: The power goes out. (This isn't the restaurant's fault -- the whole neighborhood was affected.)  6:46: The power comes back on.  6:52: Our single small bowl of miso soup arrives.  6:53-7:07: Some takeout customers leave after receiving their food, but more arrive, and start milling about the dining room.  7:08: One of our three rolls arrives. It has, to be charitable, a disappointing fish-to-avocado ratio. (See photo.)  7:12: It's our kids' bedtime, so we ask for our bill. In the hour and seven minutes since we entered the restaurant, we've received a bowl of miso soup, a single sushi roll, and the wrong yakisoba.  7:19: Bill paid, we leave.  Look, I get it -- running a restaurant is *hard*. I hate to beat up on this place, and I really want it to succeed. We'll be back in June to see if they've improved. But in the meanwhile, give Cho's Sushi a wide berth while they practice on unwitting non-Yelpers."}
