{"text":"This one of the very few Authentic south indian restaurant in scarborough. Food is amazing. Price is very reasonable. Big portion compare to other south indian restaurant. Defiantly my new favourite :)"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant with minimal décor, but serving up amazing food! This place was recommend by a friend who knows what authentic Indian food should taste like. The portion sizes were big. I split the Sambar Rice & Ven Pongal- I cannot say enough about the wonderful flavours! All the food being served looked phenomenal and I highly recommend Subiksha to anyone with high standards.  Lots of parking available."}
{"text":"This restaurant in a strip mall has very good vegetarian south Indian food from Tamil Nadu - dosa, puri, idlies etc. Their menu is not large (considerably smaller than what is on their website) and the restaurant is quite  plain in decor (although clean). However, their food is excellent and authentic and reasonably priced (you get 3 chutneys & sambar with the masala dosa.) My south Indian son raves about their food and says it is better than Udupi Palace on Gerrard Street. Takeout prices are even cheaper. Note: They are closed Mondays but open until 10 pm. Recommended"}
{"text":"Low key seems to be the right key to this girl's heart. On a slow Saturday morning, we decided to venture out to parts unknown in our neighborhood. Much to my surprise, a little hidden shop that I've so frequently overlooked, definitely exceeded my expectations in the most pleasant of ways. Subiksha is minimalistic in its décor and presentation, but when it comes to their food, it's everything but. Packed full of flavor and savoury goodness, they redefined my standards of dosas- perhaps, dare I say that this is definitely the best Dosas I've ever had.

The shop's small dining area is barely big enough to accommodate for their overflowing patrons. Popping with locals, we were lucky to snatch a seat as we entered. Bared walls and beaten furniture aside, the wait staff were lovely, even at the busiest of times. Though I had to say, they only have a very limited numbers of menus to go around, and had to wait a bit for it to make its rounds. They are little picture or descriptions to go by, I felt slightly overwhelmed by the large offerings. However, I did find out that their online website not only have the menu listed, but all the items are accompanied by pictures for the novice dinners, like myself. 

I ordered the Ghee Roast Masala dosa (with added cheese of course) and a paratha served with masala, along with a Madras Coffee and tea. The food came out impressively fast and hot. Dosa was paper thin and crisp as can be. The ghee and cheese added a layer of depth that I quite enjoyed. I loved that the Masala (although too carb laden even for me) was flavourful but not overly salty, and definitely filled me up to max itis inducing level. The lightness, evenness, and crispiness of the dosa hit all the right notes. 

The paratha was also very delicious. Flakey, buttery, and soft with a crispy exterior all rolled in one. Each of the accompanying sides was very carb heavy and will leave you quite full. We packed 50% of the meal home for later snackage. 

The tea and coffee were awesome as well, fragranced with cardamom and various spices. A definite must try. Strong bold taste that added quite a caffeine kick (take it from someone that drinks Vietnamese coffee in place of water). You should try to pull the drinks yourself. Be quick and nibble to not spill, transfer the liquid from one cup to another to add some body and foaminess to the drinks, surprisingly, by doing so it did transform the drinks quite nicely and cooled it down quicker.

Overall, hands down this place has got it all, great food at an amazing price with no added pressure of looking good while eating. It was quite fun to eat everything with our hands (even though after multiple washing and lotioning up, the strong fragrance of the spices was still lingering), just remember to wash up prior and following the meal. We will definitely frequent this joint more often, it's well worth the try."}
{"text":"*Please note: this is a vegetarian restaurant only*

Came here as a friend recommended this place and gf was craving Indian for a while therefore we decide to try this new place.  The decor of the restaurant is plain, however clean, at 2pm it is packed with people it's usually a good sign, we sat down and the waitress hand us our menu, the price on the menu is very affordable IMO, however as the waitress explains the restaurant is newly opened, the menu currently does not have any pictures.  That is fine, as we were recommended dosa and poori from our friend, we ordered both of them and asked the waitress to recommend one more to us (since we have 3 people), we ended up with protta, we also ordered  the dessert and masala tea.

The food came out fast including the dessert, and here's my comments:

Dosa:
It tastes great, crispy, freshly made, like a giant spring roll with flavors to it, in addition, there are few sauces for u to choose for dipping purpose, my favorite out of the 3 dish

Poori:
Thin crust, but soft and fresh, this is perfect for dipping sauces, I am like the variety of sauces they provide, as well as the taste

Protta:
It looks and taste totally like Chinese oil pancake, and very filling, I believe this is also great with dipping sauces, especially the tomato sauce which seems to be homemade?

Dessert:
It has a gooey texture to it, and a bit on the sweet side, however this is a dessert I never seen in other Indian restaurants, that being said, I only have visited handful of Indian restaurants therefore perhaps it's a common dish in many restaurants?

Masala tea:
Downside is you have to pull the tea yourself, I asked the waitress twice to realize I need to pour from one cup to the other, which is exactly how we see southern Asian restaurants perform the pull milk tea in front of u, except in here you do it yourself, BUT for 1.50 I am not complaining at all, not to mention the tea taste pretty good as well

This restaurant definitely have some rooms to improve like decor, but definitely a recommendation for the price and taste"}
{"text":"The dosas were made to perfection. I tried the Rava Masala dosa and it was phenomenal. This dosa is not listed on the menu, so just ask the server if it's available.

My boyfriend had the ghee dosa and he said it was good. Nice and crunchy :). 

The one thing that prevented me from giving 5 stars was the sambar. I have had better sambar at other locations, but it was not horrible. 

I am definitely going back for more :) ."}
{"text":"Nondescript place, very bare bones - tables, chairs, and that's about it - but this is the place I would take out-of-town guests for a dosa. First, it's walking distance from a subway, Get off at Kennedy, then walk underground towards the community centre. After emerging at that centre, keep walking east for 10 minutes, then when you get to a cruddy little outdoor mall on the south side of Eglinton, Subiksha is there somewhere in the middle of it. Make sure you have a camera to take a photo, because their dosa are huge and beautiful, quite the sight on the platter. As well, they are delicious. There are four wonderful condiments included, colour coordinated and tasting great. The taste at Subiksha is authentic. Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Decent south indian foods for cheaper prices  in scarborough.."}
{"text":"One of my favorite South Indian vegetarian restaurant! Pure vegetarian, very delicious. Parotta (layers like in Tamilnadu)and kurma is a must try dish here. Mysore masala dosa, gun powder dosa( note these are spicy), curd vada, filter coffee are very tasty. If you are looking for authentic South Indian vegetarian(Madras style) food, this place is a must try. Place is small but taste is great"}
{"text":"It was my first time having dosas and after reading the few but HIGHLY rated reviews about Subiksha, I knew this was the spot to get authentic & good valued dosa. 

//Venue & Service//
When you walk in, you choose a table to sit and they'll bring over menus. Once you're ready, you go up to the cashier to order & pay, then they will bring your food to your table. We were fortunate to have an Indian family sitting nearby that overheard us freaking out about not knowing what to order. So we went with what they strongly recommended:
1) Masala Dosa $8.99
2) The Vegetarian Sampler Platter $11.99 
3) Madras Coffee $2.99

There's also a sink at the side for you to wash up after devouring your meal with your hands ! 

//The Food//
MASALA DOSA- The dosa was so crisp on the exterior but had a slight softer chewier layer underneath. In the center, it had a delicious potato stuffing. It was served with 3 chutneys & sambar. My favourite was the coriander mint chutney & the orange-coloured chilli chutney. 
VEGETARIAN SAMPLER PLATTER - With a mountain of rice and pappadam (crispy thin white flatbread), you had a wide variety of additional small dishes to eat with. I especially loved the spinach curry and the cabbage dish. They also had a small dessert of the savoury Medu Vada (mini donut) and sweet Mysore Pak (yellow block of ghee). 
MADRAS COFFEE- this little cup of filtered coffee is amazing. Coming from someone that doesn't like coffee, this was frothy, light, and sweet. 

//Overall//
I would come back to this humble little restaurant in a heart beat for some authentic vegetarian South Indian cuisine!!"}
