{"text":"Ordered petty much everything - salad, pizza, pasta, steak, dessert... See photos for food order

Quality is above average, but I found the food overpriced.  Location is just a local family restaurant style-like within a small plaza.  We were seated at a 2 person table in a dark corner even we made reservation for our table of 3.  When the restaurant got busier, our table is basically ignored.  We had to chase after them for food or dessert that came late.  There were flies were we were eating too...

I would not return again based on the overall experience."}
{"text":"Bad bad place for any function cerebration be careful people , they tell one price up front then 
charge much more at the end .
I will not recommend it to nobody.
Place too small service too slow food not enough
Charge for things you didn't asked for break upfront contract."}
{"text":"My wife and I were recently invited to a good friend/neighbour's 60th b day at Il Castello. There was quite a number of us who were there and the ambiance for the size of the crowd was very nice.   The place is quite immaculate both in the eating area and the rest rooms.  Usually if the bathrooms are sloppy I know the rest will be not so great.  But this place is spotless.  Very nice variety of good quality anti pasta and very nice wine and drinks.  Most people loved the rice balls and sauce and my chicken was delicious. You could even ask for more!  My wife had salmon but somehow got tilappia I think but the wife of my buddy told the staff and everything was fixed pronto.   After the meal we all had some grappa and excellent espresso and I went to the bar to get some water.  Wow... even the water was good.  So many restaurants just pour you something out of the tap... drinkable yes but not tasty.   They actually filter their water and it was as close to reverse osmosis as I have had at a restaurant.   Although this sounds like a minor thing, it is actually quite significant.  It is these details that make a great restaurant.  We would certainly go back.  Nice location,  great food and service and very pleasant staff.  What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I was surprised to see that there are so many bad reviews for Castello, I love this place!!  Been here for lunch more than a few times while I'm in the area and haven't had a bad experience yet.  Love the food, love the staff. I usually try to come on Tuesdays for their $9.99 pizza special (I come from Scarborough and the drive is absolutely worth it). The last time I came they had an in-house special Lasagna that wasn't advertised and was recommended by the server, I was afraid it would be too heavy for lunch but it was delightfully light, made with very thin pasta and in a word - delicious.  The lighting is perfect here for intimate gatherings, and the decor is beautiful.  Would absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"Overpriced even with Groupon voucher. We were first dinner of the evening arriving late for our reservation by 30 minutes ended up leaving 7:40pm for slightly over 2 hrs dinning.  We ordered 2 fettuccine cremosa  and one penne Alla vodka and calamari fritti. For dessert we had futarto and teramisou and ginger ale and ice tea. Bill was over $108 before voucher. Taxes and tip was $50. But our server had issue with our Groupon voucher and lost what we gave her earlier.  My son like the penne with rosa  sauce though I thought it was a bit too al dente. We enjoyed the dessert more than appetizer and entrée. Over all disappointed so we won't give it another try. There was one fly bothering us too for such a fine dinning environment truly disappointing. BTW voucher cost us $39 which should cover one appetizer and two entrée and one dessert but when they were punching it in their system credit was $32/entree but the entrée we ordered was $22/dish so it cause a huge confusion. I just wanted to pay and leave as my kids were sleepy. Not very fun at all."}
{"text":"I came here last night for the first time as my friend and I both got $25 vouchers from attending the bridal show! It wasn't too busy .. our reservation was at 7:30pm and there were a few parties there when I had arrived. Food was authentic Italian. It was also my birthday so my friend surprised me with balloons, cupcakes, and gifts! The place was really nice - lots of amazing photos wer taken! The food was delicious. We started off with bruschetta which came in 4 pieces for $7!! What a steal!! I couldn't stop eating them I ate 3 out of the 4 LOL. For entree I got the gnocchi which was a three cheese gnocchi and omg it was delicious and extremely filling. The gnocchi was cooked just perfectly and t had bits of prosciutto in it which added to the texture as it was crunchy. My friend got a seafood plate in tomato pesto sauce (I forget what it's called) and I haven't tried it any but my friend said it was amazing. She could not stop raving about it. It was filled with pure seafood - clams, crab legs, etc. (I don't really eat seafood). My friend doesn't really finish her plate most of the time we go out but this time she cleaned it!! 

Anyway, the food was delicious ... but the best part I really liked about this place was their service and the people that worked there/owners. They were amazing!! Mary and Olympia were their names. And must I say.. Olympia is amazing at taking photos!! She also has an amazing sense of humour lol. And Mary was great too!! We had actual conversations and got to know her a bit about her family and life!! It's places with people likes these that show they really care about their customers!! 

I will definitely come back again and hope to see them again!!"}
{"text":"This family-run restaurant, one of the largest in Woodbridge, is multi-functional, and reflects the cuisine and style of Carnello (near Rome). Better than a home-cooked meal, dining here is about the quality and the flavour more than any fancy presentation. The menu reads, \"there is no love more sincere than the love of food.\" Homemade pasta in tomato basil sauce, and rigatoni with porcini mushrooms, prociutto and tomato sauce, are simple delicious plates of pasta. \"Did you enjoy your pasta?\" we're asked. We nod an obvious \"yes\" in appreciation. Panko crusted truffle infused risotto balls with tomato and fresh herbs are a decadent mouthful, while the the veal chop, marinated in Amarone and drizzled in rosemary sauce, is hearty and flavourful succulence. A plate of crisp fennel is offered to cleanse the palate. Its the pure ingredients and the love in their preparation that makes all the difference here."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars.

Absolutely the worst garbage Italian food I have ever tasted. Came here with a big group of people and all everyone could talk about was how bad the food is. 

Vegetables are obviously frozen and not fresh. Chicken looked as white as paper and was rubbery and disgusting. Sauce on the chicken was lemony and tangy as hell. Desert wasn't awful but was not fresh. 

Nothing is good about this place besides the decor. It is expensive, food is terrible and service is mediocre!

AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!"}
{"text":"I wanted to share my experience as I had high expectations of this place, but I was let down by Castello staff.

I had been looking for a venue to hold my friends babyshower and came upon this place. It was beautiful, the food was good, price was good and I was looking forward to bring everyone together.  Mary whom I spoke to was also very pleasant.

I put a deposit down a few weeks prior to the event to hold the spot, which at the time was the party room and I was anticipating 20 ppl.  Fast forward to the week of the event. I had called everyday from Sunday to Thursday and left a voicemail as I wanted to confirm attendees and clarify a few things regarding food preferences and games.  I did not receive a call until friday, at which point I was left a voicemail while at work. Not even 15 min apart she called again to confirm leaving the same voicemail.  So I return the call, at which point I am told I can no longer have the party room as they have a bigger group booked and I had a few cancellations ( 15 incl. Children)

I was a little disappointed, but I understood the reasoning. The female on the phone seemed rude (josie or Joanne)and abrupt when I inquired about games and one of my games were cancelled as a result of being a safety issue. This also I was disappointed, but saw it from a liability standpoint.

Coming to the day of the event, this is where our group was very let down.  We had the time booked from 12-4.  We set up our decorations and only had 1 table to work with, so we requested to have another one for gifts.  They were kind enough to accommodate this.  My guests arrived and we started eating around 1230. Everything was fine, up until another large group started coming into the same area we were.  It was 3 pm at this time and we were in the midst of having cake and opening presents.  

This is when I felt we were thought of as unworthy guests, as one of the staff literally threw our gifts onto where the cake was and took the table away.  When I confronted her, she said well you didn't need that table anyway.  I told her our gifts were on that table. She then said, oh well I can put it back up if you like.

First of all, you already took and down and your asking after. What's the point.??  To add to this this same staff member was going to charge me adult price on an infant.  She even went back to confirm with another staff member.

During this time some of the staff were trying to clean our table and rush us out by removing things from our table including guests thank you gifts.  It seemed the group who came in around 3 had overbooked and now the staff wanted us to leave.  As a group we felt disrespected and as if we were not worthy of the service as a another larger party had showed up.

Sorry for making you read this if you get this far....but I felt my experience might help if you decide to book a group here.  Make sure its a big group because it seems this staff place does not put their priority in service just profit.  

I was hoping to do other events here in the future, but after that experience I will not be returning and will be looking at other venues to give my business to. #disappointed"}
{"text":"This place does more catering and events than its operations as a restaurant.  I've been to an event there and had a good time.  You typically accept a lower standard of food, when being served in a large group.  

There is a a smaller front area in the front which is designated for the day to day restaurant.  Problem is the food in the restaurant is on par with the event catered food.

Don't order the mussels, they are overcooked and not fresh.  We got a seafood linguine special.  The seafood was not fresh and had a chewy texture.  The veal chop was cooked properly and fairly tasty."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant about 5 times, it's hit or miss- I find when you go and they are not busy like midweek you get amazing service/food/portions for the value on menu. But I have been 2 times when it was super busy and service was slow, food portions were very small for cost of menu- 
I still will return as the taste is there! just I will pick midweek slower times- the last a visited they renovated and it looks much more inviting"}
{"text":"The pasta is delicious... But we didn't get the bread :s... And i started to wonder if this is an Italian Restaurant or not :s

- Pasta 10/10
- Meat menu 8/10, definitely this is no their forte
- Dessert 10/10, has most Italian places, they really know how to make desserts
- Service 8/10, even when the day i got there it was a party reserved, and the service on our table was pretty good and kind of fast.
- the Bad Experience: they placed our table right beside of the guy who sing for the restaurant, or the show man.. And it was really laud.. My friend and I couldn't talk a word during the whole dinner... That was really annoying. They should leave the stage for him and not tables for dinner.
And the last thing again... NO BREAD!!! We had to order bruchetas instead :s

I'll recommend this place for sure to my other friends.. But to ensure a good experience, ask them if there is a party reservation, if yes, then ask them to sit you a bit far from them."}
{"text":"Overall 2.5 stars.

I came with my XO with a group buy coupon.  There were about 5 tables including ours.  The appetizers and desserts were fresh and tasted good.  (See I am so tactful that I don't mention the main courses)."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here on a groupon and should have had my friend check first before buying it.
Very slow service.  Appetizer was calamari with spicy shrimp cocktail sauce from our of the jar not spicy tomatoe sauce.   Veal was nice but meal was cold.  We asked to sub pasta side for veggies they said no and surcharge $7.95.  Pasta was over cooked. Bread was extremely hard but my company was great!  That was the highlight of my meal!  Waiting for geese cake is taking forever!   Try Visantos it is far better!"}
