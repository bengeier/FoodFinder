{"text":"Went there as part of a Meet-up.  Great tasting burgers, really good pastrami.  Great employees...clean.    Meet up was made up of nice people so we hung out a long time and not rushed."}
{"text":"Can't blame the cashier for not getting our order correct or for not getting my food delivered to my table. Management there had the cashier taking orders and attempting to deliver food to the tables. Won't be going back. Drove to the other side of town to end up not even eating after 30 minutes ended up getting a refund. Disgusting thing was when I went to get a refund my food was waiting to be delivered (uncovered)."}
{"text":"We used to dine here all the time.  It has really gone down hill.  We came in on July 30th and dined in.  They completely turned off their air conditioner to save on cost.  We were burning up.  We asked the girls at the counter if the A/C was working in the back for them and they said no.  This might be against health codes to have no A/C.    The sign was torned down outside and it was very ghetto looking inside with the bad paint job.  We asked the girls at the counter why everything went down hill and all they could tell us was that the business was taken over by the son.    We ordered a turkey sandwich and the chef made me a tuna sandwich.  We overheard another table getting the wrong order as well.  We looked at our receipt and Daisy took our order right but for some reason, the chef got it wrong.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious!! I only give reviews to those who deserve it & this place was the best burger place here in Las Vegas! I come from California so it's really hard to find a great burger place here in Vegas! I will for sure be a returning customer! The Avocado Bacon Cheeseburger was just an absolute amazing burger, the fries are to die for! Lol take it from me I usually don't try new places but this place was amazing!! Definitely recommend this to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Best sauce/dressings in Las Vegas, kind of reminds me of the sauces from California . Burgers loved by the whole family. Chili cheese fries always on point . Worth the Price"}
{"text":"Great Burgers and more. Found this lil diamond in the  rough... totally hooked. If you don't know what to order, get the Pastrami Burger.... freakin' fantastic burger."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and I love it!!!! The staff was amazing. I wish I would have gotten  the lady's name who took my drive thru order so that she could be recognized. Her customer service was more than great. I let her know it was my first time and she told me what was on everything I ordered without me having to ask. I can't get enough. Best burger I've EVER eaten...and the chicken salad was so delicious my 2 year old ate half!!!! Round of applause Mega Tom's!!!! Ill def be back!!!!!!!! Thank you!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was there yesterday with my kids and the cashier was rude.  Our hamburgers were cold so I said something about it.  They brought me a burger that ended up having 2 hairs on it.  I then had to speak to the manager which supposedly was not there but them 3 minutes later came out.  I didn't ask for my money back or more food because this happened to me it was not planned. What a horrible experience!"}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LSDJRatxW2Q They were on dirty dining when i went to go enter. A lady and her camera crew told us they were so many demerits 46!! mold on the ground. The cook who worked there didn't use gloves to make the food. Expired food, I walked back into my car. Not coming back here again. If i could give this place no stars i would."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a weekend. Definitely not the greatest part of town but nothing to fear. I'm from Los Angeles so my needs and expectations for a beefy pastrami and smothered chili cheese fries were high. We went to the drive thru and checked out the menu for a bit. We got the a hamburger, pastrami (with extra mustard and pickles) with an order of chili cheese fries all under $20.   When we finally started to eat and I must say the chili cheese fries reminded me of home. The pastrami had nice flavor but little meat and they didn't add my extra mustard and pickles like I requested, bummer! The hamburger was simple but flavorful and not overwhelming. Hit the spot ;)"}
{"text":"Tom's was recommended by my brother, who said they had burgers like the So Cal neighborhood burger joints (we call them ghetto burgers).  Having fond memories of the burger joint in Valinda from my high school and college days, I was excited when I heard this news.  Living on the southwest side of Las Vegas, Tom's is a bit of a trek since it's in North Las Vegas but we were willing to give it a shot.   Now I have two criteria that test the legitimacy of any \"ghetto burger\" place...whether or not they have Orange Bang, a neighborhood staple, and the quality of their chili cheese fries.  Looking forward to a cup of Orange Bang the size of my head, I was highly disappointed to find out that Tom's didn't have Orange Bang...one strike against!  We proceeded to order Tom's classic cheeseburger, a pastrami burger, and an order of chili cheese fries. The cheeseburger and pastrami burger tasted like those found in Cali and were pretty good. However, I wasn't impressed at all with the chili cheese fries.  The chili was just average and was seasoned a bit too heavily with cumin. Plus, the French fries in the Cali spots are usually on the thicker side but Tom's uses thinner fries that get soggy much quicker....strike two against!! Lastly, Tom's is a bit on the pricey side for what you get. For the two burgers, chili cheese fries, and a large drink, we paid almost $18.  This is around what you would pay in Cali but the portions are much larger, so there is less value for the money with Tom's......strike three against!!   If you live close by and like So Cali style charbroiled ghetto burgers, then you may enjoy Tom's, but for me, it's just not worth the drive from the other side of town."}
{"text":"No stars!! Found a long disgusting hair in my food.. When I went in for a refund they proceeded to tell me that I ate too much of the food.. I would have liked to have finished my meal.. Minus the hair.. Jerome.. What a dick!!"}
{"text":"Got lunch here today on advice of coworkers. Came in with high expectations, but left genuinely disappointed.   Couple things I liked about Tom's:  - Clean - Got to see 30 minutes worth of Mars Needs Mom on their wide screen TVs - Serves jamaica and horchata  That said,   felt that the cheeseburger combo was a little overpriced. Maybe because they cook it fresh or because they use the word \"gourmet\" on the front door to describe their food, point is I can deal with the price if only the burger wasn't a little on the bland side. Bigger complaint were that the fries were soft/limp like they were not cooked enough. The only crisp fries were overcooked. Paid extra for jamaica but warned no free refills. Last issue I kind of understand, but due to the first two points I feel like mentioning it (plus symmetry).  Then again why trust me? I prefer McDonald's fries over In-n-Out's fresh cuts (most of the time) so my opinion shouldn't amount to much."}
{"text":"The greek salad is very good! It will run you about 9 bucks if you want chicken on it, you do get alot for your money though!it also comes with some amazing pita bread i love to dip into my leftover dressing!"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite  place to eat they have the best food I've eatten at this restaurant  since  I was a little  girl and they had a restaurant  in Los Angeles, CA my family and I almost had their hole menu the best food ever."}
{"text":"Yes!!!! My kind of pastrami sandwich!!! Loved it! Definitely bomb!!! Orgasm in my mouth! Flavored are all on point! Mustard and pickles comes with lots of pastrami!"}
{"text":"good quik service burgers are pretty good and not too pricey was pretty busy inside and out and they got all our food in no time and was warm not cold food...  super clean inside and clean restrooms"}
{"text":"I eat here at least twice a month. It's either the chicken salad or the double cheese burger. The french fries are also really good. Club sandwich is pretty good too. The milk shakes are so amazing. Staff is friendly. All in all I am really glad to have found this place. Been coming here for about two years now."}
{"text":"Flavorless burger and onion rings. No server or hostess to make sure I was ok o4 had any questions. There is a mirrored window employees can watch customers in the dining room, very creepy. That should be reversed to allow the customer to see the kitchen, unless you have something to hide. Even the napkins are super cheap. My table was in disrepair. \"Tom's gourmet fast food dining\" (their logo) has 2 out of four descriptors right. It was fast, and it was food."}
{"text":"This place is slightly slow... but worth the wait. Love the avocado burger."}
{"text":"Just get the pastrami burger the way it comes with cheese, and substitute fried zucchini for the fries for an extra 2 or $3 and you will not be disappointed. The zucchini comes with a pretty big side of ranch and the ranch is delicious"}
{"text":"Love this place ! Such great variety of food and amazing quality, totally worth the price. Great customer service everyone is so friendly and helpful even the owner is hands on with his own business which I find amazing."}
{"text":"Love the Classic Taste of TOMS burgers reminds me of the good old days of fast food cheese burgers."}
{"text":"My last experience was one of the most upsetting ones. I order two bacon avocado burgers, no tomatoe or pickles only to receive a burger with tomatoes, pickles and no bacon. I also ordered a Toms burger only to find out that that burger had avocado in it? Are you serious? That burger doesn't come with avocado!!! I went through the drive through only to come home and find  out my whole order was wrong. When I called the place up I spoke to a girl working there and asked to be credited for it  her response was that \"the owner\" would not credit me unless I brought the items back and they would correct it. I drove across town for your damn burgers, so you want me to keep wasting my time, and gas to correct something you got wrong? So you want me to bring my burgers back so you can take off the tomatoes and pickles and add the bacon? Isn't that unsanitary? You would probably spit in my burger!  Greatly disappointed, I was a loyal customer, Not Anymore! Spare yourself the trouble and money and go eat somewhere else.  I would give you no stars if I could."}
{"text":"?7:00????????????????????? ??????????????????????? ???????????????????????????? ????????????"}
{"text":"I'm from south central LA and  I've been looking for a burger joint like the ones that you would find back home.  There is one called \"TOMS\" right on MLK and Figueroa and it has always had bomb food. I can name soo many more burger joints back home but neccessary when: I finally found one just like at home, there burgers have this smell and taste that is so unique.  One bite into one of these bad boys and you can't stop until it's disappeaerd.  Thank you Mega Toms, each visit is like going back home.  Your food is the bomb!!!!!"}
{"text":"So I looked through most of the reviews before we went and I have to say they must be reading these. Just about every negative thing was pretty much fixed.  The place was exactly what we we're looking for which was one of those corner or hole in the wall burger places that are randomly scattered across California. The burger was pretty good, bun wasn't dried out or anything and the patty was that distinct taste that you'd know if you were looking for it. The chili cheese fries had melted cheese and tasted good. The real gem was the fried zucchini that I've been craving for a long long time as no other place makes it, except Farmer Boys and it's a terrible half cooked insult. The regular fries were pretty good too.  We even made a mistake with the order and they fixed it for no charge even though it was our mistake. I would absolutely return as long as they don't mess with the formula."}
{"text":"Excellent tasting food. Worth the drive from S. Vegas. Had steak sandwich and as a do burrito.  Hmmm. Prices in their menu are no the same as in their Web site but it made up for taste"}
{"text":"Just like Tam's in Cali! We go often! Always a treat! The inside is under construction but the service remains the same! The staff is always friendly and my food is always good! Gained weight with this place tho! Definitely not for those dieting!"}
{"text":"Menudo on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday!  I've seen the signs, and I finally did it and tried the menudo. It was different than what I grew up eating where cow stomach always had a little more chew on it. I am open to different types of food and quite enjoyed the way MegaTom's cooked theirs. It had more of a collagen or cooked tendon texture to it, but the soup was quite tasty. I can't handle super spicy, so I was very happy when I tried the soup, it was tasty, and the extra spice was in a small container to add in if I wanted to. The tortillas were excellent, nice and warm and soft. The serving portion is also huge."}
{"text":"We finally found a burger that taste like a burger from California, now we don't have to wait for our next trip! It hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Love it!! Charbroiled burgers omg so good!!! I felt like I was in a momma papa place like the ones they have in Cali.. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Worst place I've been too . Never will I return. I enter to a dirty restaurant , only thing nice about the place is the cashier , treated me with respect and I appreciated it , I ordered a chesseburger and some chili fries , the burger felt like it had been sitting around and the fries were extreamly cold , the person I was with ordered French toast , when they arrived it looked like it was placed in the freezer , it was so cold the butter did not even melt when it touched with the French toast , I was trynna not to complain but saw my partner was eat nor enjoying their food so when I told the lady about it she returned the food but seconds later he owner came out flying from the back with the biggest attitude ever . Saying he checked the cameras and saw that we were eating the food with no problem which was a lie , my partner tried eating a bit but gave up after she felt uncomfortable eating it , he also claimed that we were only complaining so we can eat for free , I told him to keep the money from the French toast because I did not want his money back if he was going to be so rude about it . After that he went to the cash register and basically threw it to his employees to hand it back to us . Never have I felt soo disrespected in a restaurant , for a second I felt like the owner wanted to physically assault me . I would NEVER tell someone to head to this restaurant . The owner is very pathetic and I hope his attitude changes or else I don't see his business ever progressing which it shouldn't since the horrible service it gives out. I seriously wish I could rate this with no stars , 1 star is a gift ."}
{"text":"Second time I have been here. First time was good. This time the food was sub par. Food with no flavor. Onion rings just tasteless. Cheeseburger again no flavor. Not worth the drive."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for a delicious burger and fries meal without the In-N-Out wait (and chaos). I've been here at least 8 times in the past year, and they never disappoint. The fries are exceptionally good, and I always leave with a full stomach.  Note: The drive-thru isn't fast, so I would recommend eating inside where there are (2) flat screen TV's."}
{"text":"I have been to Tom's like 3-4 times, and didn't enjoy the burgers I have had. I don't remember if I got one with cheese on it or not, but it seemed a bit dry and boring. I also did get a breakfast item once there and am not sure if i liked it. I just ordered carne asada fries and a grilled chicken salad tonight.. The carne asada fries tasted good( it has the grilled flavor),  there is some mix of chopped avacado and tomatoe on the side I liked it but its basic.I don't feel the plate is loaded with meat but there is enough there but for the price just a bit more meat would be impressive. As for the grilled chicken salad, it is served on top of iceberg lettuce with some slices of bell pepper, hard boiled egg, tomatoes and  a little bit of shredded carrots with a side of a bit of pita bread. Total I paid like almost $17. The food for price just doesn't make me satisfied I feel it could be better, but some people are so picky maybe they can't dress up the food well ( like the people that don't like onions or certain spices) So usually, I just go to Tom's once in a while when I don't want to take a long drive to Wendy's, Mc Donald's or Carls Jr. Tom's Burgers right by my house and has a good selection of items to choose from"}
{"text":"Love this place because they give a discount for my work and they got great food love the steak sandwiches"}
{"text":"Love this spot! Well their burgers/sandwiches haven't really tried anything els or heard anything. Be prepared food takes some time to get because it's always fresh. Well worth it !!"}
{"text":"I love their food everything we've tasted so far has been absolutely amazing their customer service isn't bad either"}
{"text":"-10 stars!!! Rude ass biotch! I will NEVER come back here again! Service is everything to me and it's customers like me are the reason why you have a job or this place is even in business! Act like she's annoyed or not in a good mood. Maybe if she greeted customers with a hello or thank you her English would improve significantly!!!!  Please excuse the cuss words but that's how I'm feeling and thoroughly annoyed. Whether I spend $3.00 or $30.00 I work hard everyday and decide to spend it in your establishment but you wanna be rude? Never again!!!!  I never give horrible reviews like this but I expect descent service when I'm spending money at your business. Period no exceptions cuz I have bad days too but my patients will never know it!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty turkey burger .  Combo w drink and fries in 5 bucks ...just want the burger .. 5 bucks"}
{"text":"After a long night of public skating at the ol' Fiesta Rancho, I was hangry for some grub. While not being so impressed with the options available at the Fiesta, a quick search on the Yelp app brought me over to Mega Tom's, and I have to agree with the majority on this one, the food is pretty good!  Even though the name implies that it is basically a burger joint, Mega Tom's serves a wide variety of foods including breakfast, Mexican, dinner entrees, as well as burgers and sandwiches. They also have a drive thru if you want to grab some food to go. And, they are open really late.  The first time I came here I tried the Mega Tom burger. This is pretty much a standard cheeseburger with all the works. I really liked the taste of the burger. It had that greasy spoon diner taste to it, and it brought back some fond memories. The lettuce and tomato were really fresh and crisp. I liked the bun that they used as well. It was soft, but still held its shape while eating the burger, but I thought it could have been toasted slightly more.  On my next visit, I went on to try the world famous pastrami sandwich. This was probably my favorite thing I've tried here. The pastrami they use is amazing! It's very tender, moist, and melty. I also liked the fact that they used a not-so-lean cut of meat. Because ladies and gents.. Fat is flava! The spicy brown mustard and sour pickles complimented the sandwich wonderfully. Even though I thought the bread was ok, I thought, like the hamburger bun, should have been toasted more.  This place reminds me of greasy spoon diner food that I grew up on the East coast. Everything was really well prepared and the service was good. I will definitely be back whenever I am over on this side of town."}
{"text":"The food is alright. Drive thru takes forever and mostly every time I go their milkshake machine is down."}
{"text":"I love toms famous burgers out in california its a to go place when I go out there. So when I heard there was one in vegas called mega toms burgers I had to try it the service is great they are very friendly the food taste just as good as the one in california the chili cheese fries were very delicous and the double cheeseburger was even better the chicken strips were okay some were harder then others but still okay I hate that when I got them I got them as a meal so I had more food then I already intended to eat.  The vanilla milk shake was good and tasted just like you would expect a shake to taste overall the food was good and I was really full which was my intention and I plan on coming back whenever I get a chance."}
{"text":"It was good. But not the greatest. Fast food definitely. Got the chili cheese fries because of the reviews. Might've just been an off night because it had a \"watery\" taste to it. My boyfriend did like the pastrami burger though."}
{"text":"Stopped in during lunch time with my co-workers to give Mega's Tom's a try.  Prioer to walking inside, be sure to lock (double check) your car doors.  The menu offers hence the name, many different burgers, sandwiches, breakfast and a \"South of the border\" options. I went with a bacon, avocado burger combo with fries and a drink included.  The food was fresh and delicious.  Everyone in the group was very happy  MTB's and so was I."}
{"text":"Amazing! Best burger in Vegas for the price.. Mega Tom burger, fries and drink for $6! Excellent"}
{"text":"Never again. I used to tell people about this place and how the pastrami sandwich was worth driving for. Not anymore. I have noticed the quality of all the food here changing and not for the better. They started out using only American cheese on the pastrami sandwiches and then started using.. well.... I'll just call it white cheese. The white cheese has no flavor! Seriously the pastrami sandwich on my last few visits was so incredibly greasy and disgusting. When I order a pastrami sandwich combo I do expect that I will receive a full combo. I ask for cherry pepsi and they give me regular pepsi. The meal is supposed to include fries and they weren't in my bag. I was just left with what should have been a really good pastrami sandwich but instead was a pile of fatty grease. I decided to try their breakfast this last time and while it did taste good it wasn't what I ordered and items were missing yet again from my bag. Where was the cheese I paid extra for on my eggs and spuds? Where the hell was the french toast that was supposed to come with it?? I have regularly used the drive thru in the past and not had any problems so I don't know what's happened but after me giving them more chances than they deserved I am done."}
{"text":"My BF spotted this place a month ago but never stopped in. We were in the area the other day and decided to stop in and look at the menu. We ended up dining in and I had the Bacon Avocado Burger Combo (fries and drink included) and BF had the Rib Eye Steak Dinner. The burger was big and fries were golden and crispy.. yum! I didn't taste the steak, but it came with a side salad, veges, toast, and choice of baked potato or fries for $9.99. Prices aren't bad. We'll be back to try more of their items."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers and chili cheese fries. Breakfast is ok for a drive-thru as well.  They need to clean their iced tea machine though, tastes dirty and burnt."}
{"text":"If I could have rated this place three and a half stars I would've. Let's get the bad news out of the way. Mega Tom's Burgers can be a hit or miss, and I thinks it's due to customer service or who ever is in the kitchen at the moment. When it comes to customer service I personally don't know what to expect when going to Tom's, it's either going to be the lovely personality of an opinionated cashier that has suggestions on certain food items to try(rare) or the girl that over charges your credit card three times(true story) and is just there until a better job comes along. First of all let me say the prices set the expectations of the food. I am a foodie and a cook, and in my opinion there is no such thing as \"too expensive\" when it comes to great food. With that being said some of the prices are TOO EXPENSIVE for certain items on the menu. The menu is enormous! The pastrami is quite distasteful for a place that promotes specializing in making great pastrami sandwiches. The burgers are, good, but keep it simple, nothing more than cheese, bacon, lettuce and tomato. The breakfast burrito's are good and the Greek Salads with pita bread are tasteful as well. Their pita bread is actually great. What makes a great place to eat is having an item on your menu that taste better than any place near by that serves the same item, and Tom has done that with two items. The Turkey Burger and there house Ranch dressing. I can promise Tom's has the best ranch dressing in the world. I live in Summerlin and there have been plenty of occasions where I've drove across town just to get an order of fries and ranch, sometimes two trips a day. If you're into to Turkey burgers then you know to find a good turkey burger is like a finding diamond in the rough, well welcome to the rough. Tom's burgers are good, but the turkey burgers are the best Las Vegas has to offer, and I'm still searching. Overall Tom's is a place where you find something you love and stick to what you know. I'm sure if they get the pastrami right, shave the prices by a few pennies and make sure the customer service is consistent this could easily be the go to eatery of Las Vegas for locals and tourist alike."}
{"text":"Really screwed up and shady you have NO signs up at the drive through order sign or the window about your new 3% \"surcharge fee\" on the over all total of the bill. You only have a little sign that says cash discount. No credit card company does a surcharge on food. So it looks like your business is finding a way of screwing over customers with shady business."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a place like this since moving to Las Vegas. I finally was recommended to come here by a former cali resident. Explain to me how a dinner for 2 ended up being 40 dollars. I ordered a burger and fries, my girl friend ordered a gyro nothing special. We were shocked, the only thing we did was upgrade to chili cheese fries. The food was good not great, the ranch was incredible.   I am so happy i found what i was looking for but for the price and quality not happy. I will probably come here when I am missing food from cali but not as often as I ate this food while living there."}
{"text":"Everytime I drive by here I want to give it a try...I wish I kept driving. Soooooo overpriced and the food was not great.  We decided to dine in and the restaurant was like an oven, it was unbearably hot and made our meal miserable.  It is not fun to eat chili burgers indoors with no breeze while sweating profusely.  The chili here was horrible!  My husband and I laughed at how hard it is to make a chili that has almost no flavor.  Oh well...now we know and can skip Toms in the future."}
{"text":"My first and my last I ordered extra meat and paid for it on both a pastrami burger and a Philly steak the cook argued with the cashier saying that the receipt had no extra meat on it but then looks up at me and says there's extra me on there how the f*** did it change without you even touching the burger or the Philly cheesesteak. Plus when I was like just give me back my money there girl get me $2.50 because she was so frazzled by the situation that she was just like oh no I just charge you for or I gave you back the money for a regular one first and last time definitely not a good spot"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to come for lunch with my coworkers. The food is good and the staff is amazing. They are friendly and tend to remember what we order when we come in like 3 times a week. I recommend this place for a great meal. America, Octavia and Tania are great employees."}
{"text":"We visited the one in Barstow California on a vacation and then found out that there was a Mega Tom's in my area. I was thrilled, to say the least.  I've had many different things here, but I love their burgers and chicken fingers. Their fries are good, but you almost have to eat them first because they tend to get cold quickly.   The staff isn't always the friendliest, but they're almost always busy when I go in. There are a few great employees there that go out of their way to accommodate requests for picky people such as myself.   Their food is reasonably priced, but has gone up a but since I started going. A meal here can set you back between $9-15 per person, depending on what you order."}
{"text":"I went for pastrami chilli cheese fries and a pastrami burger. These both were pretty good and I'm glad that they open early."}
{"text":"First time here and it was alright. Not bad, but not amazing. It was \"aight\". My west burger could have been better (thin piece of meat, bacon not crispy, onion rings were okay. Barbecue sauce wasn't the best, BUT, I've had way worse and way better. Bread bun seemed like it's been sitting since it was falling apart). I also got the chili cheese fries and they were whatever as well. Not bad but not great (cheese wasn't melted, but sprinkled on upon serving, chili had small pieces of meat and some fat. Lacked true flavor but again, it's not bad) They have banana peppers, and hot sauces and you can grab as much as you'd like. Restrooms were clean. Diner was clean. Ladder was out.  It was average. I think this would be a great place to eat after a night out or if you're just really hungry, or if you're nearby and need a quick bite. Cashier girl was friendly enough so \"A\" for service! They claim they have the best breakfast burritos in Vegas, so I may come back to try them.  This is definitely a 3 star place, in my opinion. I'll update if I come back."}
{"text":"Managememt apparently has no problem with homeless people being in their restaurant harassing customers.  I've had homeless people hit me up for money and food before at a restaurant entry, but I've  never had one follow me inside to the register and continue to harass me as I'm ordering. Until today...  When my sandwich arrived another homeless person rolled his wheelchair next to my table to ask me if I was going to eat the other half of my sandwich.    I get that it isn't the most affluent part of town, but management needs to set some boundaries or people like me will not come back no matter how good their pastrami is."}
{"text":"It is rare when I find myself on the north side of town. On occasion I do happen to drive through. I try to avoid it after dark at all costs since it is not the best area. I was a bit surprised when I saw this little gem, there are a lot of empty spaces in the shopping center but they were busy enough that I decided to give them a try.  When I pulled up to the drive through , I was amazed at the huge menu. Reminded me of home sweet home (California). I wanted to sample everything off the menu but I had to practice self control. I ended up with the chili cheese burger combo and boy it did not disappoint. I gobbled that combo up within 5 minutes and was left wanting more, so what do you do when that happens? You go back for more!  I went back the following morning to sample their breakfast. Steak and eggs, pancakes, and the pastrami burger. Oh and the sauce, don't let me forget about their burger sauce, it is amazing, definitely gives the burgers a great taste!It all was very good, the hash was very crispy but it was too plain, that is my only complain. Other than that, everything else was very good. Definitely worth the drive across town in my opinion."}
{"text":"Don't eat here ! It's disgusting, it was on Las Vegas dirty dining here's the link https://youtu.be/LSDJRatxW2Q"}
{"text":"I usually frequent Tom's Burgers whenever I want a burger or pastrami along with an order of their yummy french-fried zucchini, however today?  At the front counter inside I was told that their deep fryer has been out of order for the last 3 days, so no crispy zucchini with lunch for me today.  I am really disappointed in an establishment that doesn't repair or replace the things in their business which makes them money.  I had to decide whether to go to 5 Guys or Farmer Boys for a burger or eat Mexican food.  I hope I don't have to wait much longer to get my Tom's Burger fix. . ."}
{"text":"This place reminded me of the mom and pop shops that are on every street corner in LA. Boasting a large diverse menu of greasy diner food, as well as Mexican fare, this place was sure to satisfy my needs. Unfortunately this was not the case. Womp, womp.  To start, the interior is grungy. The tables are almost always dirty as well as the floor. The workers were not very friendly and they are stingy with the drinks. I hate when soda fountains are behind the counter. My boyfriend drinks A LOT of liquid, and everytime he needed a refill we argued about who was going up there to ask for another.   The quality of the food was meh. I had a pastrami and it was soo stringy. Bf had the chili cheese fries that were mediocre at best. The chili is def. from a can, and the shredded cheese they put on top was not even melted. At least TRY and put out a presentable dish. One time I had their carne asada burrito and it was sooooo delicious, I told my bf it was the best burrito I ever had. Well that was a one time thing because the next time I had it I nearly spit the meat out. I can't see this place staying open for very much longer."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas checking out the downtown area on a Saturday night. Before going back to the strip, my friends and I were in the mood for a good ol fashion burger joint. Mega Toms is just that type of place. My Philli cheese steak was good, my friend's pastrami sandwich was on point, and my other friend had no complaints about his bacon burger. The fried mushrooms were good, but the fried zucchini was very addicting! They have bottomless soda with your combo meals and the food portions are going to fill you. The staff was really cool, nice atmosphere with the tv, and plenty of everything available on the menu. The only thing I noticed is this place is more expensive than the local burger joints where I live. $10-13 combo meals compared to the $8-9 combos for the same food I eat my local joint. But I'd still eat here again next time I'm in Vegas and want that burger joint food taste."}
{"text":"It's impossible to find a good non-chain burger here in Vegas. Tom's is pretty good, not great. In So Cal there's a joint lke this on every corner. Here Tom has a corner on the market. It must be why he is over priced. I also dislike the location. I didnt enjoy the view of the ghetto from my window seat."}
{"text":"Ordered the Western combo with chili cheese fries.... It's a little more expensive than LA but it taste just like Tom's/Tams/Tom's Jr in LA!!! I'll definitely comeback when I'm feeling homesick lol"}
{"text":"On Sunday, 9/10/17 between 8:20-8:30am I stopped by for a Menudo before heading into work. The young lady that attended me in drive thru by the name of Ruby took my order, I paid her with a $20 bill, she took a few min to come back to the window with my order. I drove off because i was running late them realized I never recieved my change $11.xx back. I called immediately and informed them I didn't get my change, she stated she gave me my change and I was lying, I informed her I didnt even get a reciept for my order. I let her know I'd be back at 1:30 during my lunch to speak to her manager, she said she didn't know when he would be there. Sure enough he wasn't there, so I returned at 8pm, Spoke to the manager, he said the videos were very blurry so he couldnt make out if I recieved my change, but he'd count out the till and if it was over he'd give me a call and my change. 3 days later NOTHING! I'm not the only person at my job this has happened too, others have had their debit cards ran for more than the purchase amount. I didn't ever think I'd have a bad experience with this business. I'll never go back and others from my job have stopped going there for the same reasons. Bad experiences... This review is for the Lake Mead/Simmons location in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Great staff friendly environment the food is amazing. I come here often especially for the bacon avacado cheese burger omg it's fire lol y'all gotta try it. This is a go to place for good burgers !!"}
{"text":"Not sure if management changed or new owners but it's definitely different, and an extra .82 cents for a transaction fee, really??? Then they offer a discount for paying cash, and the fries I once loved (steak fries) are gone. Now it's the crappy frozen regular fries. Why change a good thing."}
{"text":"I go here often, food is always fresh and scrumptious! They seem to have everything on the menu to pick from so from breakfast lunch or dinner this is definitely a place worth checking out! It's close enough to home and pricing is fare for such big portions! Always ask for a side of your favorite dip, you will not be disappointed! Thank you for being so convenient and having such good food!!"}
{"text":"Love the food. Salsa is amazing. Have to get here earlier by 1100 to get me a sausage breakfast burrito. If that is ad good as Barstow's then I will eat here often. Nick I'm glad you built these stores. 5 stars today."}
{"text":"Food was good. I got a cheeseburger it tasted fresh. They messed up our order by not putting cheese on one of the burgers and then wanted us to pay extra for their mistake. I was surprised they didn't just fix the mistake seeing as how it was their fault. Good portion sizes and friendly staff. Just wish they would have fixed their mistake."}
{"text":"For my first time at this place, not a bad experience., Service was fine..food tested good and all atmosphere felt cool!"}
{"text":"I ordered the steak and eggs with a side of hash browns never got my eggs extra hash brown called to speak to manager and the receptionist only took my name and said she'll tell him we'll see how that goes"}
{"text":"One of the better burger joints in town. I have eaten there over a dozen times in the past 2 years. Breakfast is great and at a great price especially the burritos. Lunch burgers and pastrami are awesome!! Even the chicken breast salad will fill you up. BLT is average and one time my burger tasted like it had been sitting for quite a while. Everything else has been great!!"}
{"text":"I am originally for a suburb of Los Angleles called Carson,  where they had some of the best small Mom & Pop short order burger joints,...... Apollos, Carson Burgers, Ted's Burgers and Yellow Basket and more along those lines another place pretty famous called Tommy's Burgers or as the locals call it, \"Tommy's\"  When this place opened up the smell reminded me of being back home so I ordered a double cheeseburger combo with fried zucchini and instantly was taken back.  An extra large menu choice with great prices, so if your headed west on Lake Mead Blvd maybe to do some bowling at the Texas or just heading out to the Wal-mart, make a quick stop here and get your grind on."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Haven't tried anything else. Definitely not fast food. Takes a while to get your order but so far the wait has been worth it."}
{"text":"The fries were good and crispy..the burger was a bit of a let down. I felt like my bacon was thicker than the party itself..I was a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"There burgers are good if you like them well done let them know there usually a little pink in the center. The pastrami and lamb gyro are good as well."}
{"text":"I finally found it!!!!  A mom and pop burger joint in las vegas that absolutely kills it.  My favorite restaurants on the fast food side of things are local joints similar to what I grew up with in Pasadena, CA.  This place has all the right elements to match up with any of those places in socal and is much needed here in vegas.  The kitchen has a huge glass window facing right into the dining room, and everything was super clean.  It also has a drive through!  The menu is extensive with things like homemade croissant sandwiches and breakfast burritos for breakfast.  Along with carne asada burritos and gyros for lunch and dinner.  I got the chili cheese fries and a pastrami cheese burger, because how a place does these two items is a make or break deal for me.  They were spectacular.  The chili was beanless, with crispy fries.  The cheese was a  nice light cheddar blend on top not aged too much to dominate the dish.  The pastrami was a little thick for what I am used to, but the charbroiled cheeseburger it came on and the fresh tomato, onion, and lettuce with thousand island dressing was perfect. The combination was excellent.  I am so stoked las vegas finally has a place like this, and it's open till 11PM.  I will be eating here a lot.  Give this place a try if you're considering going to five guys, in and out, or fatburger, you won't be disappointed.........  I gotta try one of their breakfast burritos next."}
{"text":"They charge for any dressing with your combo most of the time. Why??? Anyways is close to home."}
{"text":"This was a Mega Fail! I came in on thursday afternoon at 1 pm. Im assuming that I was just missing the lunch crowd so getting my food should not take long. At first glance there were two things that stood out to me. One was that some of the tables were not cleaned up meaning there were plates and leftover food from previous customers not to mention the floor looks a bit filthy. Second was that the giant oversized menu that sits above the counter is a bit intimidating. So many choices. To me that is either not good because consistency might be an issue or they might be so good that anything you order is that good!  So based off of the cashier's recommendation, I got their most popular item which was the Pastrami Sandwich Combo ($11.19) which comes with fries and a drink. The sandwich itself is pretty big. If I wasnt really hungry, I probably would only ate half of it. The pastrami was a bit chewy and more on the salty side. Now I know pastrami is naturally salty but this was a bit much. The fries were just your basic medium cut frozen fries. Nothing to write home about.   At first I thought this was the only location but after looking at their to go menu, it looks like they have 2 other locations in California. One in Apple Valley and the other in Barstow. I have been to both towns and I dont recall seeing a Mega Tom's at either place.   Overall, I was not impressed at all with their pastrami and how dirty the floors were. This is where the too much selections on thier menu thing might be their downfall. The good news is that you get free refills and they didnt charge me for adding regular and grilled onions to my sandwich. Btw, on the Yelp listing it says they are open 24 hours. That is wrong. The hours are everyday 7 am to 10 pm dine in and 7 am to 11 pm drive thru. For now 2 stars it is. I will update this review accordingly based on somethin different I will try next time im in the area.  Yelp 2016 Review #2 \"The Mega means a lot of food choices!\" 575 overall"}
{"text":"Wow now they're charging 4% for using your card that some crap all right food for the price I won't be back hope everybody sees this better have cash because they want to keep your money on your credit"}
{"text":"Not in yhe best neighbor hoodbut really good food. We've tried burgers, fries and the grilled chicken sandwhich. Grilled chicken was nice and juicy. Cant wait to go back and try other items."}
{"text":"The pastrami sandwich and fried zucchini was all I tried and I was satisfied. I would definitely visit this place again. I don't know how the sit done dining is because I ordered through the drive thru."}
{"text":"Well Tom i live 3 blocks away. And as you can see i checked in 16 times. What is going on? The food is going down hill bad. You have to keep caring. Or you wont have a business. I see your working today. (Yes tom himself) and you let burnt hashbrowns and under cooked french toast. Steak now with steak and eggs is paper thin. Im so disappointed. My family is visiting from Washington and we sit here disappointed."}
{"text":"So I just came to this place to get my niece a bite to eat before I picked her up from school. It was convenient because I didn't know the area too well. I should have just went to McDonald's. Chicken was so small for .99 cents each and of was so dry!!! I almost choked on it. I paid almost $10 for fries and 4 tiny pieces of dry chicken. Should have just looked at the map for another fast food restaurant that's actually much better. I'm so disappointed. I guess I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Just what you expect good food and clean bathroom the closest you will get to a cali burger stand here in Vegas"}
{"text":"I got the ultimate combo (this thing is a monster! 3 patties!) the girl at the counter was very nice, and the dining room is empty at 11:40 am, but the drive thru had some cars in it. I think I made the right choice of coming inside since there are only 2 people working, and they're having trouble running the window.  The burger was great! Fries were ok, and the soda was a little flat, but I'll come back and order again. Do yourself a favor and avoid the drive thru..."}
{"text":"This is a joke.. My second review to give this place another chance and they failed.. Got 2 double cheeseburger meals but the cook wasn't paying attention and made one burger with two top buns and mines had 2 bottom buns like really.. Ruined the burger and made it dry for mine! Never returning... Sad."}
{"text":"Tom's is awesome. That's all there is to it. There is NO burger like a Southern California Style Burger. All these restaurants are family owned by Greeks and man do they have the recipe for burgers!!! From the best bread (especially made for them), to the meat (also ground for them and spiced like no other) to the construction of the burger!!! The fries are so delicious (even cold no kiddin') and the orders are huge!"}
{"text":"Same charbroiled burgers from my childhood.  Complete with super hot crispy fries and fresh lettuce, tomato & onions.  Bonus points for the yellow chile peppers!  Can't wait to come back and try the Pastrami.  Need more Tom's locations in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some breakfast on our way to Utah. I would rate 4.5 stars for this place. Breakfast burritos were cooked perfect and everything tasted good. Young lady working the front did a great job and was very friendly. This place was pretty clean and seems new but in a rough area. Thanks mega Tom's!"}
{"text":"We were super excited to find out that Toms opened up in Las Vegas we normally go to the one in Barstow. First, I wait 5 minutes to have order taken. Second, clerk can't seem to get my order right.. on top of a 4.% charge for using my debit card. Third, forgets to bring out drinks and Ranch. Fourth, I had to get up and get my own drinks while clerk was helping yet another customer.   When I finally get to eat my Pastrami sandwich it was dipped in some unknown grease. The sandwiches had hardly any meat in it.   If you have ever been to a Toms the sandwiches are fat and full of meat.., that's why we don't care about cost,  but after paying 12.00 for my sandwich with little meat.., we will not be going back! Dining room filthy, restroom filthy  I will just continue to buy mine from Barstow."}
{"text":"Love it! Reminds me tom's/tam's from back home in like the spots in South Central LA!   Cons: the price was a bit higher being that it's Vegas..."}
{"text":"Just like LA!!! Bomb.com don't hesitate just go!!! Got a double bacon cheeseburger its was on fire!"}
{"text":"Ok so at work yesterday we ordered Mega Tom's. I had them once before when I ate there the chicken fingers were good but small. But to yesterday's order,l which was set for delivery. I ordered a Pastrami burger with a side of zucchini sticks and a Pepsi to drink.The burger was quite tasty even though I asked for no lettuce, tomato or onion even asked for Swiss and received American the drink was flat and tasted like diet, and the zucchini were little mushy rubbery pieces. We also ordered  tacos and chili cheese fries.  When orders are set to go, you think all the condiments would be included especially if food is bull of flavor like the majority was. Tacos had no salsa or sour cream just chicken with cheese on soft corn tortillas. The chili cheese fries were like a huge box of mess, chili was blan and very gross. I will try again only because I was told their salads are good. So for now if you venture to eat here, eat in and enjoy blan food, or try a salad. If anybody would like me to review somewhere feel free to reach out and let's see where I end up next...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both ordered the pastrami sandwich. First of, the service was great and the cashier was friendly and nice. They bring out the food for you. My pastrami sandwich came with fries and a drink for about 11 bucks. I expected that, since I pay that in California.   For Vegas standards, the pastrami was good, but there really isn't much competition out here. I live about 9 miles away from this location, so I was stoked about this place. I wouldn't drive out here again to get my pastrami fix, because capriottis  is down the street that satisfies my cravings enough. The pastrami was a little dry and wasn't as flavorful, but the bread was soft and delicious. I give this place 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"The quality of the food and service has really changed here. I have been coming here since they opened and things just aren't the same. The pastrami sandwich is greasy and fatty compared to what it used to be, which was really good. The last couple of times there have been items missing from my order. Not only was there items missing from my order this time, but the food wasn't even how I ordered it. I ordered the french toast breakfast which comes with eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns and toast. I paid extra for cheese to be put on the hash browns and scrambled eggs. I placed my order at the drive-thru and when I got to the window, I asked for some jelly for my toast and she said she'd put some in the bag. After I got the food, I pulled over to a more deserted part of the small shopping center to grub. When I opened the container the food was in, I noticed there wasn't any of the cheese I paid extra for on my scrambled eggs or hash browns and there also wasn't any jelly in the bag for my toast. I didn't want to go back inside over cheese and jelly even tough it was frustrating. I just went ahead and ate. The bacon I have to say was delicious. The eggs could have been mixed better so there wasn't any white in them, but they were average. I only had a couple bites of the hash browns they were very greasy and soggy on the bottom. I didn't mess with the toast or sausage and noticed after I had eaten the eggs and bacon that I had no french toast!   OK that's it! The last couple of times items have been missing from my order and now it's happened again. It was about more than cheese and jelly at this point and I decided to go inside. As I waited in the line there was a couple customers ahead of me. The customer at the register was in a wheelchair and had a service dog with her. The lady at the register was so rude to her! I was almost in tears at the way she was treating her. The lady told this customer that her dog needed to not bother any customers and she needed to take her food and leave. In the time I was there I never once saw the service dog go near any customers or do anything other than look after his owner. When the customer went to pay, the lady working told her that it was hard to reach so far over the counter to get her money. Really? Didn't your parents teach you about providing service regardless if you are at work or not? I really wish there was something I could have done, but the customer kindly took her food that she paid for just like the customers before her and after her did and went on her way. Then when it was my turn, the same rude lady accused me of not being a customer and instead of being someone who just wanted a free meal. Say what? I have eaten here several times and this was the same lady who helped me at the drive-thru maybe 10 minutes prior. She refused to give me the french toast and told me to just \"have a nice day\" instead because she couldn't do anything for me. I'd be sadder if the food were still good food, but it's not.  This business stole from me by having me pay for items they didn't give me and refused to correct it which is more than enough to never come back, but the way I saw the one lady treating disabled customers was enough for me to never come back."}
{"text":"They don't even deserve a star , I ordered through door dash. Placed an order for 3 toms burger combos & 1 bacon avocado burger. When I got my food the burger was missing the avocado ! Called & spoke to the rudest person ever. I told her my situation & she was like \"no we put the avocado , we made sure\" I told her \"the cook didn't put the avocado\" she said \"the cook is the owner & he said he put it !\" I then told her why would I lie about an avocado ?! That rude person just hung up the phone on me! So rude !!! I just wanted to let them know that they're cook wasn't doing their job & just cause it was the owner, He's too perfect to not forget someone's avocado.. maybe if you did your jobs right you would have more customers & the owner wouldn't have to cook. Then you could hire a real cook & better staff! This is what I get from ordering from a burger place in the wrong side of town. I should just order closer to my home & not give my money to small businesses like toms."}
{"text":"Best food in town! Always smiling when I come here! Try the carne asada fries! Cheff Raul makes them really good!"}
{"text":"Got to drive thru place my order after waiting more than 30 min people honking I got to the window n ask me to repeat my order because they didn't got it so my food was not ready and couldn't even apologize"}
{"text":"Hungry for lunch during a recent trip to Vegas, I found this place using the Yelp App.  It's not in a good area of Las Vegas, but it is relatively new in a nice building.  After browsing the menu and chatting with the talkative cashier, I decided to order the Double Bacon Cheeseburger combo w/Fries and Large Soda, $9.93. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mega-toms-burgers-north-las-vegas?select=zHrIN1vHvJqa4HaSS9z5nw#zHrIN1vHvJqa4HaSS9z5nw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mega-toms-burgers-north-las-vegas?select=KqWlebWdZjsGJ7JyAnoMNg#KqWlebWdZjsGJ7JyAnoMNg  It took a little while for them to make the Burger, which is a good sign.  They brought it out to my table and I dug into it.  The Burger was pretty good, not bad.  Fries were OK.  Overall, I'd rate it 3.5 Stars but I'm rounding up because of the friendly staff here.  They were all pretty cool and helpful.  I'd come back to try their Mega Burger...wasn't that hungry that day.  Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"Got a double cheeseburger combo- wow! AmaZing menu, friendly drive- thru experience. Worth the calories- fries were crispy and delish!"}
{"text":"Interesting variety of food. Good tasting, and a nice stop when you've been driving a few hours from LA to Vegas."}
{"text":"First time here.  Food was good, but burger was awful thin for the price, and my order was wrong.  I would have taken it back,  but because of the 15 minute wait, I didn't have time.  Onion rings were great."}
{"text":"I give it a 3 1/2 stars.  Greasy goodness!    Mega Tom's is not a place I was familiar with until I saw reviews on Yelp.  Apparently they have quite a few of them in Cali, and they have a pretty big following.  I guess it only makes sense since we in LV are neighbors that eventually a Mega Tom's Burgers would show up on our side of the state line.  Fair warning, be alert if you go visit Mega Tom's after the sun goes down!  Not that I can't get along in the near ghetto area (or have any issues with it), I just don't want you to think the surroundings are all roses & potpourri.  It's a lower income area so please, be respectful of the people around you.  You never know!  A knife in the kidney or a punch to the face can't be that fun.  And no, I would never make fun of the ghetto, as a college student I lived in a little apartment for 4 years near the badlands of UNLV (Flamingo & Spencer, anyone?) and I've been within throwing distance of gunshots, stabbings, and robberies.    With that, Mega Tom's is nice inside.  Clean and tidy for the most part.  Their menu is large are pretty scattered, so it's good if you're as indecisive as I am sometimes when it comes to eating.  There's a little bit for everyone.  Like, total randomness for everyone.    For our first visit to Mega Tom's we stuck with what they are popular for, burgers and sandwiches.  The wifey got the Mushroom Burger which she liked at first, until she bit into a large glob of warm mayo.  Ha Ha!  Don't ask me why, but she hates heated mayo on just about anything!  Ruined her appetite.  She liked the burger and the mushrooms with cheese, but the warm mayo set it over the top for her.  Way too greasy!  She ended up leaving the other half for me.  The little one had the Bacon Burger which she loved.  Burger.  Cheese.  Bacon.  Then another slice of Bacon.  And some lettuce and tomato for good measure.  She finished just about all of it.  Again, only complaint was that it was a little greasy.  I had the Club Sandwich (I love them so) and I was surprised.  It was of good quality.  The bread was toasty, the bacon was crispy, the lettuce and tomato were fresh, and there was a good amount of mayo on it for lubrication.  The ham and turkey were supermarket cold cut quality, but I can't ding them too much for that since it's not exactly fancy eats.  Overall a decent sandwich.  My only complaint?  Greasy!  The onion rings and fries that came with my sandwich were on the slippery side.  Yep, extra napkins needed for cleanup.  We even opted for an extra order of onion rings and oh boy were those greasy too.  Either the oil needs changing or the folks at Mega Tom's need a better way to drain the excess grease!  As you well know, greasy food can leave and unsettling feeling in your tummy.  We all had that afterwards.  I really think we were just on grease overload is all.  If we took out the fries and onion rings, we would have probably been OK and enjoyed our meal more.  Best part about Mega Tom's Burgers?  The prices!  All the combos we had were in the $6 - $8 range each.  Cheap eats for the masses!  And it looks like we will probably try here again soon, their breakfast and dinner plates look interesting, and lots of folks say their Mexican food is on par too.  We'll just get less fries and onion rings next time.  Visit Mega Tom's Burgers...home of (Greasy) Gourmet Fast Food Dining!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are awesome.  Fried Zucchini is the best in town.  Onion rings are good.  Breakfast plates are a great deal - quick, fresh, and better than IHOP.  Values items are good - bean and cheese values burrito beats any taco chain.  They are always busy and the food is good.  It's not a fancy place and it's in the hood, but it's one of my favorites.  Some menu items like pastami sandwiches are kind of expensive, but the portions are large."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise Tom's was for me today. I had driven by it several times but today was the first time I had the chance to stop. I was unsure going in what I would take away from my experience. There are Tom's in my home town (or similar places at least). Those places are hit and miss. Sometimes great food. Sometimes average. Other times substandard. Mega Tom's though, brilliant. Courteous and professional staff. A clean restaurant. Awesome food. I got a pastrami burger and fries. I was shocked at how big the burger was. One of the biggest I have had. It was very filling. It was fesh too. No heat lamps here. The fries were great too. Thick cut and tender. A little bit of malt vinegar is the only thing that could make those fried potatos better. I'll be sure to come back again."}
{"text":"Ive recently moved to this neighborhood and the food was excellent. I ordered the bacon avocado burger and a BLTA. I actually used DoorDash to pick it up and deliver the food. The only parts can think of to change would be to allow customers the choose their temperature of their burgers. I was called by DoorDash and explained only well done is available. Also the iceberg lettuce is standard on the BLT, but I think there's shredded lettuce on the burger. Not a big deal and I'm sure it would be used if a costumer would ask for a substitute. Overall great food and will return."}
{"text":"BAD location  Busiest neighbor is a liqour store.  So get your food and run.. And by the way.. Will not return there.. They charge a \"Fee\" if you use a debit card.. Did not know til i looked at my receipt since no one at the drive thru said anything.. RIDICULOUS!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fried mushrooms are amazing. Service was decent. Although I ordered cheese fries when I received my order the cheese wasn't melted and the fries weren't even hot. That was the only negative I had. Besides that everything else is delish !"}
{"text":"Great burgers (avacado bacon burger, pastrami burger) and a really good breakfast. There will be some wait time for your food as they make it, so maybe calling in advance is a good idea!"}
{"text":"Been remodeled since my last visit, looks fresh and clean... The service was great, the employee who helped me was very friendly & professional. I had the Garden Burger combo. It was tasty, with lettuce, tomato, onion.  Crispy hot fries. Love the small banana peppers, that are free. Over all, fast, friendly tasty burger."}
{"text":"I can't believe after the great post I put a couple weeks ago, they would actually go back to the high prices. This is very disturbing to me.  The manager is just greedy.  Luckly I go back to california every month or so. It was nice knowing you Toms.  Good luck with business as i'm going to assume a drop in customers.  Update a review if management decides to not be money hungry,  Ok, ill be nice, you get my point!"}
{"text":"This place is so good, it reminds me of all the great burger spots in Cali! We had a burger combo with zucchini fries and a chicken west combo with chili cheese fries. Both were really good. Prices are decent, we paid 21.00 for both meals with upgrades. I will defiantly be back again! It's a must try if you like Cali burger spots!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places I see myself frequenting despite the fact that the service is shitty. But I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since people who work in fast food tend to have shitty attitudes anyway. Sucks for you.  The food is thick, greasy, juicy, and throbbing. It's nice to take a break from the big chains and taste frozen food from Costco cooked for you.   Now I have another therapeutic option instead of smoking crack or posting dramatic quotes on Instagram."}
{"text":"The service was horrible...I got my burgers and had to wait for 20 minutes to get my shakes.  By the time we got home the burgers were soggy and cold!  Too much bun...no flavor...not so good!  When I came back and asked for my money back because I couldn't wait longer for the shakes the girl had quite the attitude!  I don't get the reviews on the quality of this place...really there was nothing that stood out.  Fries were fries..kinda bland in fact...the burgers had HUGE buns on them so the ratio of meat to bun was way off...the shakes were good...not wait 20 minutes good but they were tasty.  Not a must have place...really a disappointment!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and gotten the cheese quesadilla plate (it comes with rice re-fried beans, a couple of crispy fried tortilla chips and a fried jalepeno). The quesadilla is a really nice size and I probably would have been full with just that for lunch. It is crispy and I like to dunk it into my re-fried beans and scoop up big mouthfuls of goodness. I'll be honest and admit I rarely eat my rice, but when I tried it, it was good. The best unexpected part is the jalepeno. The crispy skin and the juice inside is delicious and adds some pizazz if you squeeze it over your food. If you want more of a Mex-Americano style meal, they will exchange the re-fried beans and rice for fries. You would initially think the fries are nothing special, but then you bite into them. They are hot and crispy. None of that floppy, fast food, lukewarm fries you would find elsewhere.   On one of my other visits, I ordered the french toast for breakfast and it was great. You get several triangles that are crispy on the outside and soft when you bite into them. They give you butter and syrup. Although, I love sweets, I cannot handle a lot of sweets first thing in the morning. Not a problem with the french toast. It is not too sweet and still taste great with just butter, which is how I ate mine.   Last but not least, the young ladies working are always friendly and customer service is very important to me. Definitely stop by if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I just tried this place yesterday and I thought the burger I had was great. I will definitely be hitting this place up again"}
{"text":"To quote George St Pierre, \"AY YAM NUTE EEMPREZZED\". My meal was slightly mediocre, but not quite bad. I don't think anything was made in house....it tasted like all the food came from a food service company. $11 for a combo meal from a fast food restaurant is high, so my expectations were raised, and sadly, I was disappointed. The only reason I tried this place was because I didn't have the time to drive the 5 miles to in n out (which would have been both better and cheaper). I also felt slightly obligated to come here because I used their restroom a few weeks ago without purchasing anything......let's call ourselves even.....crappy food in return for.....well, you know. I can't see myself returning."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim. I was hungry and it was on my way. BIG MISTAKE.  There were about 8 tables being used, about half the restaurant. two guys walk in, walk up to each table and start blabbing about headphones they are trying to sell.  Next, A lady walks in and before ordering, tells the lady behind the counter that she is pissed at the world and is going to shoot some girl. She says this a few times,  Then my burger comes. It was simply horrible. I really don't think the burger was really beef. It seemed like some processed something-or-other. Two bites was enough for me.  On the good side, The fries were good!  I have no desire to ever visit this place again"}
{"text":"I got excited when I found a burger joint in las Vegas been out here three months. From la n this food was very expensive for the quality of the food n proportions were small. The fries weren't cooked all the way through n onions rings was like they got skinny paper onions n battered them up. No good n I love burgers. I did like the WiFi n tv's n how they brought the food out. But I wouldn't go here if ur in need or a good burger"}
{"text":"Another \"As I Eat Review\" So far the ordering experience was fine but the restaurant is filthy. I ordered a pastrami chili cheese burger and the wife ordered a club sandwich combo.  Fries are ok, thick cut. 4 out of 10. Onion rings taste old. 3 out of 10. Club sandwich is pretty good The ham stinks though. 7 out of 10. Pastrami Chili Cheese Burger is decent. 6 out off 10. It might have been better if the cook actually put the cheese on it though. I would've had them fix it,  but i didn't notice until i was halfwayt hrough the burger. I tested the customer service by mentioning to my friend that they forgot the cheese, in front of an employee and she looked at me and then quickly turned away and rolled her eyes....i thought that terrible attitude, along with the dirty floors and table  was enough reason to stay away from here"}
{"text":"This is nothing like the hamburger spots in LA. I got a breakfast burrito & it was awful. Just greasy & didn't even taste like it had any salt or other seasonings. I thought ok u have salsa & peppers that will make it better, wrong! How do you even make salsa with no taste! I will not be going back & wasting my money."}
{"text":"I used to work next to this place at the Murrieta, Ca location.  I would frequent it quit often and it was very good!  When I saw there was one in Vegas, I thought \"hallelujah\" they have the best french fries ever!  I went on a weekday at about 9ish in the morning.  I ordered the breakfast special with eggs, pancakes, toast and hash browns.  I also ordered a coffee, a side of french fries and a side of ranch dressing.  I had a YELP check in discount on my phone app, but did not use it because the counter girl in the drive thru made me feel un-welcomed and I cowered down.  My order was ready pretty quickly and I drove off.  On the drive, I decided to sneak into those amazing fries and could not wait until I got to my destination.  Those crispy, crunch, fries I was craving were nothing more than limp and grease! Sigh, major disgusting disappointment.    Got home, and I had \"no hash brownns and no toast\" in my order.  Stupid me for not checking over my 13.00 order.  My coffee was good and so were the eggs, can't go wrong with eggs right?  However, the pancakes were the most disgusting thing I have ever seen.  They were a brown/red color.  They tasted like they were cooked on a greaser that had NEVER been cleaned.  I have never in my life tasted a bad pancake, I didn't even know that was possible.  But guess what Mega Tom's Burgers made that possible.    I will never go back, and recommend anyone to not go back either.  Not only was I jipped food, what I was given went straight to the dog."}
{"text":"This place is really good I have been driving past it so many times and finally I went in. I ordered the avocado burger I was really big and tasty. The order took some time, but it was well worth the wait. I will be going back soon to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers  in Las Vegas with out having to get a second mortgage. Been here several times over the last few years."}
{"text":"Alright so I been coming here since this place first opened here, and when it did it really tasted like some bomb place back in LA in La Puente, really awesome knowing it not too far from me. The last year or so the place has def had a drawback since those those. To start with they are on the corner of Simmons and lake Mead accross the street from 7/11. The area is not that great and there's always people creeping around that plaza. The place is a burger joint so chilli cheese fries breakfast and some sandwiches are all about the place. But the service has really dropped lately, it usually takes pretty long to get through the drive through. The food at least that I have had is definitely a 4 star just the service is not that strong and the time efficiency really hurts then. Overall the burgers here are the most charbroiled taste in most of the spots that arent a big chain and I love their chilli cheese fries"}
{"text":"It always sucks when you have a bad experience somewhere.  This place was one of my favorites.  I am a contractor and we built a new building right down the street from here.  Some of my employees told me how great the place was and I tried it and agreed.  Fast forward a few months and I stopped by last week for something small to snack on.  I used my debit card and was charged for using it.  (They never did that before). Then I asked for a side of ranch to go with my fries and was told that was an additional charge. (Again something they never did before). I asked the lady when they started with all of this and she told me she's been there since the day they opened and that's always been their policy.  I told her I went there weekly for almost a year and never encountered that.  She told me I was wrong and didn't know what I was talking about.  It sucks that a bad experience like that will ruin how you feel about the business.  The place was my go to spot for a while and now I don't think I will go back.  I'm not going to a 1 Star because the food has always been good and the service usually was too."}
{"text":"This place has terrible staff. They have terrible attitudes. They hang up in your face.. the manager is never on shift. And they always get my order wrong! Today I've had enough"}
{"text":"Food was GOOD, but not great...just \"ok\" in my book.  I went with the Pastrami Burger Combo ($7.99). Burger was ok, a bit overcooked and fairly thin. The Pastrami was a little mellow...not too much flavor here, but the SAUCE is great! It's good overall, but again, not great in my book.   The standard fries are a bit boring.  You've all had something like these before...nothing good or bad about them, just very lightly seasoned and forgettable.  Chili Cheese Fries ($4.99). Pet peeve of mine is when the cheese isn't even MELTED on top...and is still cold from the fridge. Chili was a bit SWEET too. Just ok. Fries were run of the mill...just average.  I paid extra for the Horchata, and it was good.  It's an additional charge on top of the burger combo, and I don't think they offered free refills.  Maybe the other stuff on the menu is better, but since it said \"burgers\" in the name, I was hoping that's what they specialized in :(  Doubt I will be back"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. The location is in deep North Las Vegas (non-yuppie chow town) so put into consideration what time would be best not to get shot and what not...so, I'd say before 2pm. Went here last night and it's a good thing football was on TV so everyone's at home.  Their menu is pretty busy. They have burgers, fries, sammies, Greek salad, Mexican food, etc. They have combos in secret code and you probably have to be a regular to know what those codes are. I had a few bites of their pastrami burger and chili cheese fries, and an horchata. I might say the burger was pretty tasty and the party wasn't dry. The lettuce they put on the burger was green and fresh (way better than wilted fast food chain lettuce). Their pastrami is what I call \"beginners pastrami\" which is great for non-pastrami lovers like me. It tastes milder than the average pastrami.  This is a no none sense type of place. You pick what you want, go up to the counter to place your order - if you ask questions they roll their eyes at you, take a number and have a seat, they bring your food to your table, you eat and you leave. What happens in between leaving the restaurant and walking to your car may vary."}
{"text":"I had an issue with my card after buying one of my beloved Garden burgers. The manager researched the problem and dealt with it accordingly. He even apologized for the mishap. Kudos to Toms for having an intelligent, responsible management staff, I wish I knew his name. Thank you manager at Toms. Also, have I mentioned The Garden burger with cheese wrapped in lettuce (no bun) is awesome? This place is a trek for me from Summerlin but I make the drive for that specific burger."}
{"text":"You know a place where you can get a steak dinner or a french toast breakfast with actual eggs at a drive thru? Now you do. Mega Tom's Burgers offers inside seating as well as one of the better drive thrus.  Better not just because you can get the full menu and the food is good, but also because they don't often make mistakes.  The only complaint I have is that the owner gave me a discount card when they first opened.  It has become so difficult to get them to honor it over the past few months that I gave up trying.  Typically, that would be cause for me to stop using a place, but I can see the owner is trying. I know the economy is making it difficult. They lowered their prices which I thought were good anyway. So, I save myself the frustration and I don't try to use the card. It might expire at the end of the year, which is at the end of this month anyway.  At least it is just the end of the year and the card and not the end of the world which so many thought would happen on the 21st. For me the 21st was the end of school, which meant the beginning of vacation and freedom. So take that you Mayans! Back to Tom's.  The food is good.  For 10 bucks, you can get a full dinner.  They even ask how you want your steak cooked.  I love the steak and egg sandwich.  I'm partial to the pork chop dinner - 3 chops which is a crazy good deal, with baked potato or fries, veg, and a legit salad.  Better than McGarbage right? I like the fired chicken, but it needs more chicken.  Now, I'm just being spoiled I guess, It's a drive thru and you're thinking junk or meat, but do treat yourself to a salad.  Really fantastic.  i've had the chicken and the tuna. They are huge and delicious.   The pastrami is also good, but too spicy for me, cause I'm a food wimp. There, i've admitted it!"}
{"text":"I just moved out here from California and have been trying to find a good charbroiled burger place and I have finally found it. Me and my bf wanted to find something to eat near Texas station and found that this was nearby. Their burgers are delicious  I had a bacon cheeseburger and it reminded me of all the burger places back home. Their French fries could of been crispier but maybe it was an off day. But I think I found my burger place here in my new home."}
{"text":"Very good burger, fries were good and the deep fried mushrooms were awesome. And let's not forget great prices, service on the other hand wasn't very pleasant."}
{"text":"We got the pastrami meal and the meat was very flavorful buy you got wayyyyyyy to much fat it need to be trimmed badly."}
{"text":"The daughter brought home the fried fish and we were surprised.  You know you you can poke on a rubber ball and it pops back out? That was the bettered fish. We couldn't help but open it up and found the size of the fish to be about a third of the size of the coating. There were two other fried fish pieces that were also ridiculous but the size of the fish was a tad larger. We won't be buying fried fish from here. I guess this is why they aren't called Mega Tom's Fish. I included photos."}
{"text":"I wanted to stop and get something to eat. So i checked hrs and it said it was still open tell 11 pm great. So we stopped both doors locked. So i called asked why they was closed when the sigh says 11 pm. Well I was told by very rudky lobby was closed at 10 pm and drive thru 11 pm. If u going to have a business state correct hrs that u are going to be open."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Great prices and lunch time specials are great as well! The cooks do a great job and prep looks great."}
{"text":"It sounded so good. I guess I should have had my first warning from the super large menu at the drive through.  Fast food places can't possibly do so many different items very well.  The burger was better than a McD's burger in terms of appearing to be real meat but it was overcooked but had a touch of salty flavor.  The ingredients appeared fresh but were slopped all over the burger so they were falling out the side covered in wayyyyy too much sauce.  There was simply no way to eat this without a mess.  It didn't help that the bun was a flat soggy goo. Maybe I should have tried some of the other items that people are raving about.  The indigestion I suffered afterwards reminds me why I stopped eating fast food to begin with.  The service was also pretty bad. My food was ready and in a bag on the counter and sat there for 5 minutes while the drive through guy took care of the only walk in customer in the restaurant. Finally the prep cook had to give it to me."}
{"text":"I have been driving by this place on my way into work and finally found an opportunity to grab a cheeseburger here. Outstanding, home-style that reminded me of Steakburger. Thank goodness for good reviews because I may have never stopped to try it out otherwise."}
{"text":"My friend happens to live near this place, but she never tried it. So we decided to go late one night. The food was amazing! I ordered a caesar salad with grilled chicken, not expecting much. It was loaded with feta cheese chunks of tomatoes, olives, cucumber, and plenty of Veggies. I forgot to mention the delicious juicy grilled chicken . I thought $8.99 was a bit pricy for the salad but for the amount of food they put in, it was worth it. The service was amazing as well. I had called to check what time they were open and the gentlemen who answered the phone was very friendly. The service in the restaurant was good too. The gentlemen at the counter was very friendly. We ordered to go and the other gentlemen behind the counter brought us our order out to our seats. We accidentally had left the restaurant thinking we had both of our orders, and then one of the associates came chasing after us letting us know that we still had another order. I definitely recommend this restaurant. Food and service were both great! I can't wait to try other item on the menu!"}
{"text":"I got a bacon cheeseburger, and wasn't too thrilled with the meat or the buns. The fries were actually good however.   Their menu selection is wide and you'd find something here. I would go back for the fries but that's about it."}
{"text":"This the fourth time we come here this mth and I swear I'm sitting in the car in the drive thru for the last 30min we have officially turned off the car... it takes a eternity to get your food...."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today because I pass by it on my way to and from work.  The place was a little busy and it was clean and presentable.  As for the menu, there was so much to choose from.  From burgers to egg sandwiches to tacos to fish and chips.  I ordered the charbroiled chicken supreme without bacon combo meal, to go. Pleasantly surprised!!! The quality of the food was better than expected. The fries were PERFECTLY cooked and crispy. A generous amount was in the bag. The chicken was well seasoned and cooked properly. The sandwich comes with avocado and Man did it come with avocado!!!! I love avocados and was expecting a couple of slices like most places would serve but it seemed like it came with an entire avocado. Thick piece of tomato. The bun was warm as well.  Also, I asked alot of questions when I got there and the staff was very pleasant and seemed to really like their jobs which makes a difference in how you are being served. Very friendly and helpful. Offered me refills and didn't charge. I will def go back and tell my friends!!!"}
{"text":"This review is on behalf of Mega Toms on Lake Mead and Simmons in Las Vegas Nevada. I just received my food and spent 40 dollars for my family and I. I ordered my child the chicken strips and fries the chicken strips are littler than an ant I was pissed and so was she. I ordered the chilli cheese fries the chilli was horrible it tastes like canned chilli which im pretty sure it is just a horrible taste and flavor i tell you what the only thing good here was the ranch dressing im so serious stay far away from this place this place is completely garbage for real i would not recommend this place to the Devil im extremely pissed off they give you a huge container with no food this place is a waste of time period DO NOT GO HERE. Im telling you you will regret it."}
{"text":"No lies, I'm a fan. I discovered Mega Toms when I was on one of my patented food binges. The location is pretty nowhere, it's up in north town behind the drive in and not exactly something you'd expect to come across. Inside though, the location is beautiful. The menu is pretty extensive with burgers, burritos sandwiches and actual entrees. The variety is certainly nice. I've been here multiple times and I've changed every time. **The Good*** Pastrami burger  They have horchata and Jamaica  Workers generally seem to like working there   ***the bad***** They charge extra for Jamaica or horchata, which is the first I've ever seen of that anywhere The only two times I've had the drive thru, the wait times were absolutely ridiculous  The fries zucchini was extremely meh  Overall, I like the place and wish the had more locations"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a co-worker and food was good. Very clean and food was fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Well I needed a burger. I had gone past my normal time of consumption and I needed a burger, now. Well Tom's looked like a nice place - I'm going through the drive-thru. I have to say as far as drive-thrus go this is a five star drive thru. The Person was nice, attentive, patient, and took my order easily. I had a the pastrami Burger and I have to say as far as fast-food burgers go that's was very nice and the fries were excellent. So I liked it as far as restaurants go it's still just a 3 star restaurant but with a five star drive thru"}
