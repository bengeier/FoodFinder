{"text":"For 8 bucks you can get a basic sushi roll, your choice of ramen or udon, miso and a salad! The more complicated rolls will cost a little more. Ive ordered the ($8) spicy tuna my first time the ($12) las vegas roll the next. Both were yummy! The salad come with this tasty creamy dressing on it. The miso was flavorful. The Ramen noodles were kind of soggy but we did get our food delivered which took about 45 minutes to an hour. For the price all was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I ordered one of the lunch specials at $8, which included an entree, your choice of ramen or udon soup, miso soup w/ a small salad. Not bad at all, especially since I ordered a salmon dish. I also ordered a crunchy roll for $5, for the price I definitely cannot complain. This place is very close to my work and the delivery was very prompt. They did have a $5 delivery fee which I thought was a bit pricey not including tip. But you can't beat the convenience. Will def be coming back for sure! Great for a light healthy lunch!"}
{"text":"Great food and large portions for the price. One of their $12 specials gets you 6 pieces of nigiri sushi with udon soup, miso soup and access to the salad bar!"}
{"text":"Good sushi purple rice convenient location by the university  Weird toppings on the rolls but overall good flavor"}
{"text":"Whenever I have the craving for sushi this is the first place I think about. There staff are friendly and welcoming. I always have a wonderful experience when I come here"}
{"text":"Place was amazing. We had all you can eat sushi and every dish was even better than the next. We had four large guys at an all you can eat buffet and there was always food at the table. The sushi chef took on our challenge and destroyed us so we bought him a beer or three."}
{"text":"this place is right next to unlv so I came to try it out and it's really Gooooood the place is chill and the workers are aside from that the food is well done and I plan to come here more"}
{"text":"The California roll was the best!! They had such a variety of meals; was definitely worth $8 (the special). I will definitely be coming here!"}
{"text":"Great food! But if you want refills, ice in your water, or wasabi/ginger, you'll have to ask every time because it won't automatically be brought out. But they bring all of your stuff out fast, so it all balances out. Swaggy Dog roll and salmon teriyaki are yummy!"}
{"text":"Red devil roll was amazing and had beautiful presentation. The udon could have been better but I don't regret ordering it. My favorite part of course was the salad bar :) it's definitely a good place for some good cheap sushi."}
{"text":"Clean environment, great music, and really good food. I would recommend coming to Oodolee. They also great specials throughout the day and are located in a great spot for UNLV students."}
{"text":"Got the $100 set menu and it was such a good deal! Really fresh sashimi platter. Perfect for 3 or 4 ppl. Def. coming back again! they also gave us free shots and mochi(:"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my entire order! I ordered online and gave me the option for 'ASAP' or 20min increments... I was 10 min away so i ordered for ASAP! (Which I figured the food would take about 15-20minutes to make) so i called about 5 minutes after ordering to make sure my order went through and was told it would be ready in 30-40 minutes. Showed up to pick it up 30 minutes later and they hadnt even started with the order! There was 2 other 'ToGo' orders ahead that were being worked on! (Which those customers were upset for the long wait as well) Food was basically ready an hour after placing order! When I told the employee that it was taking too long and he had said 30-40min he said \"yea i know has it been that long yet\" i said yes it has its been about an hour! No apology Nothing! The food itself was not good at all! Ive had store bought sushi taste better than that! Looked very effortless...Maybe because they were in a hurry who knows. Would not recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Such a cute local place! Delicious food & great service! Plus it's super affordable. There is a huge menu full of discounts that you can get pretty much all day. Plenty f space and perfect for a late night dinner or to stop in for a quick lunch break. Would definitely recommend stopping in and trying it out!"}
{"text":"Greeted and seated immediately. After ordering, the food came in an appropriate time frame. I had the bento boxes which were large portions, however a little on the saltier side. Aside from that, the udon and California roll that I ordered was great. The purple rice caught me by surprise, but the food was good. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"awesome serivce!!! i go here all the time i love it!!!! burrito roll is amazing."}
{"text":"So today I changed my groove from Yamasushi around the corner and decided to give oodolee a try, too my surprise it beat my expectations, yama always has at least an hour wait. There was no wait here now I did come here at 10:30 on a Thursday night...so which was great because we had fast service.  They also have some different choices that Yama doesn't offer.  Now I ordered a bunch of the specialty rolls which were all delicious especially the baked scallops...what I really liked was the purple rice, doesn't taste any different to me but made a big difference in presentation of the food. I highly recommend u give this place a try.  I would rank this place in the top sushi spots in Vegas for sure.  -Alex"}
{"text":"For the low prices, this is a really nice sushi restaurant! Went with some friends for lunch a couple of times and the portions were always huge. It's near the university too (like--right besides it) so it's a pretty convenient place. Waiters were sweet and the restaurant is clean. I've tried the tuna tataki and unagi roll; both were delicious. There's also all you can eat here.  If you're not a fan of crab, make sure to mention this to the waiter! They have imitation crab inside their rolls, but they're glad to switch it out for you!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and I have to say, it blows Yama away. Sat at the bar and the service was great. Had sashimi (super good), the Kuso Roll, and the Ninja Roll (my favorite!). The rolls were really generous. They had a great rice to sushi ratio. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So da gooooooooooooood :3'................soo da yaaas. Food is good. Music is good. Pretty relaxing place"}
{"text":"Until I discovered Oodolee Sushi, I didn't think a restaurant existed that offers affordable, QUALITY, DELICIOUS sushi DELIVERED right to our door! Not only is the food amazing, but the service is fast and great every time. When we order baked rolls for delivery they are always still warm when they arrive at our door. LOVE this place and will continue to order from them weekly."}
{"text":"Came at 9PM on a weeknight and the food was great, and service was quick. The spicy mayo on the sushi rolls is spicier than most other places I've tried.  But it's a great place. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great service. Felt like a king when i walked in. Very grateful to come to a place were they respect you in a nice manner. Will tell everyone in las vegas and out of state to come by.   ALL YOU CAN EAT doesnt get better than that. The food taste like it was made from a god of the universe. Every bite i took my mouth wanted more."}
{"text":"Our new favorite AYCE spot! They use purple rice in all of their sushi rolls. A must-haves spider, shaggy dawg, firecracker, serenade, toro, uni, and volcano with baked salmon. This place is a must try for all you sushi lover!"}
{"text":"My family and I love ordering food from here. They deliver, even though we aren't very close to their location. Their food is always amazing and well worth the price!"}
{"text":"Delicious and great service! Very clean and cute restaurant and diverse menu. Sad I haven't tried it sooner, will be back!"}
{"text":"I got the spicy pork and ramen. Prices are fair. The food is good and comes with free miso soup. Location is close to unlv in the Chipotle Plaza."}
{"text":"Good sushi, cheap food. Unlv discount  10% off. Awesome place to go with friends and family. Staff nice"}
{"text":"Hands down the best hole in the wall sushi grill place off the strip. Cozy friend and family environment with 5 star quality food from hard at work chefs you can see. Worth the drive wherever you are believe me. And the all you can eat special is a deal !!!!"}
{"text":"As I entered the restaurant, I was greeted by many of the employees. My server Sharon was welcoming. I liked that there were lunch deals starting with $8 meals of a choice of one dish and ramen. The food was very pleasant and I had nothing to complain about. Also, the wait for the food was not that long. Overall, good experience for a good price!"}
{"text":"Oodolee is the best place you can go for lunch. Their lunch special is only like 8 bucks! You basically get a full course meal with eight bucks. This includes salad, soup, and an entree! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go to on my lunch breaks at UNLV. I live on the other side of town but I even came out of my way to come eat here. I introduced my friends to this place and they also love it!!"}
{"text":"Some of best Poke soup. Spicy with lasting flavor. Not just hot. All the rolls are on point from the traditional to the specialty rolls. Staff is courteous and attentive and they have this Yuzu Sake Aladdin bottle that is to die for. If you're near UNLV and you have a hankering for some sushi just walk across the street and be treated to some excellence."}
{"text":"My first time here. Great service. Great food. The portion size of special was incredibly large. I ordered the chicken teriyaki with ramen. The taste of the chicken teriyaki was unique and flavorful. The ramen was spicy, delicious, and full of vegetables. My sister ordered the #8. OMG! It was fantastic! The tempura was perfectly fried and crisp. The middle one was soooooooo delicious and is our favorite!  We're definite coming back. The food and service are great!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Ordered delivery and got it in 45 minutes. Purple rice throws you off.  Ordered the California roll because it's simple. It was just a mix with tiny bits of crab in it. Hardly any cucumber or avocado and the cucumber that was there was not crunchy at all, but completely mushy.   Also ordered the banana tempura. Mushy and bizarre taste. Only could take two bites.  Overall slow service and terrible food."}
{"text":"I love this place! I like coming here for their special menu. Very reasonable price too! It comes with your choice of sushi served with miso soup and with ramen or udon. I highly recommend. Yummmm."}
{"text":"Ordered the 1 item bento with Karage. The food was great as usual and fulfilling for the cost."}
{"text":"good food with great deals!  the service is very attentive as well!  must try the lunch special"}
{"text":"It is a good place to eat. The food is delicious and cheap! Compare to school, I would like to eat here!!!"}
{"text":"I was so pleased to find this sushi place near my new home.  It became an instant favorite of mine.  The quality of the food is amazing and I love the purple rice.  The service was also very nice."}
{"text":"Very very slow. Took about 10mins just to get a glass of water. About 25mins after I ordered some rolls all I got was 2 pieces of sushi. Food was ok but I'll never come here again just cause of how it it takes"}
{"text":"This is some of the best Ramen and the BBQ short ribs are delicious for really cheap. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Sushi cheap eat! Their lunch special definitely filled me up; it came with miso, a very generous bowl of spicy Ramen and 3 very tasty nigiri pieces. They use a purple grain of rice that adds an interesting aesthetic to the sushi. The sushi itself isn't mind-blowing but the quality is definitely a notch above its price. They have an all you can eat dinner option that I'd like to try. Again, not amazing sushi but for the price to quality ratio and presentation, I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place earns zero stars to be honest. horrible service. Raw fish was warm which was nasty. Thank god i didn't get sick from it. They use this purple rice which was nasty and i just didn't understand the taste. The place wasn't busy at all but then me and my friend waited 30 minutes for two rolls. Horrible horrible horrible! Don't waste your money on this place. Kaizen, sakana,& kaya are still my top favorites lol"}
{"text":"I love the all you can eat sushi here! The rice to fish ratio was perfect. The fish was of great quality. definitely coming back here"}
{"text":"A great dinner special selection and for an awesome price! Also very tastey seaweed bar."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely horrible. As someone from Hawaii and lived in Okinawa for three years, I can say their sushi is by far the worst I've ever tasted in my life. The purple rice is different but nothing to to rave about. Their udon noodles were poorly cooked, the sauce on their sushi was bland, and the shrimp tempura was mushy. Wish I could give it a half star."}
{"text":"Our delivery driver was so quick! And really nice too. Our food was so delicious! I wasn't all that hungry, but I ate every bite."}
{"text":"Food is great and reasonably priced. The purple rice threw me off at first but don't let looks fool you -- their Fire Cracker roll is my new favorite !!"}
{"text":"The dungeness crab was so big! Also, sushi and sashimi are fresh and delicious! I liked pork katsu and Oodolee slush"}
{"text":"Great sushi and open late! Udon is amazing, ramen is great but spicy so be careful! Bento boxes are super full and really good too!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and prompt, the service was cordial and helpful, The music's good, and the atmosphere is really friendly, Awesome Sushi place!"}
{"text":"Really great food! Their happy hour is awesome. They use purple rice but it's really great. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the sushi here at the new restaurant! also theres a discount for unlv students and the convenient location is a plus. i would really recommend people coming in a group of at least four since the chef gives a complimentary dungeness crab"}
{"text":"IT's very delicious ! I\"ll come back ! Salad is quite good, bento box tastes good as well, I'm pretty that I'll come back another time."}
{"text":"I love there portion size and the price is decant. There tempura is really good, love the sushi here too it's a must eat at place ;)"}
{"text":"It's hard to find good All-You-Can-Eat sushi places, but this is my first visit and it won't be the last! DELICIOUS! I love that the rice is purple and that the waiters are very attentive and kind. I feel like I might become a shameless regular!"}
{"text":"The food is very well cooked. Yum! Very good environment and service! We had a good experience here. I strongly recommend this Japanese food restaurant!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Best deal for sushi around. The all you can eat special is awesome. Come hungry."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! Sushi is top notch, and service was amazing. Chefs were pumping out the orders and we couldn't keep up with the food coming in. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch !!! They give you lots of food for just $10 !!! Food taste yummy ;)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to eat here after having a tiring day of college. College hurts the brain but Oodolee soothes it. Miso soothing haha!!"}
{"text":"Great vibes. Good times. Good people. GREAT DRINKS TOO! I got a strawberry sake and boy was it delicious! Great times !"}
{"text":"Wanted to surprise my girlfriend for a special occasion with some delivery and know that sushi is her favorite so I went about looking for the best sushi place that I could find that also delivered. Found this through yelp and ordered 35$ of food. My girlfriend said she really enjoyed it however it tasted slightly off. For the next couple of hours she became incredibly sick to her stomach and proceeded to throw up multiple times that day. While I can't say it with absolute certainty, I am almost positive that the sushi we received was bad in some way or another. It was the only thing that my girlfriend had eaten that day since she never eats breakfast and became too sick for dinner afterwards. When I called them later that night after I had gotten off work they seemed very flustered and unsympathetic. Additionally, no manager was present. Overall a very negative experience for me."}
{"text":"All shushi are amazing taste very very very good ? U must come and try the fresh sea food here ? ???? ????"}
{"text":"Adorable hidden gem across from UNLV.   So glad we found it. We ordered 2 bento boxes and took advantage of their yummy salad bar. Service was quick and attentive. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"At the time of this review, the overall rating of this place was 4 stars, which is why my husband & I decided to eat here for dinner. But don't let that fool you because this restaurant bribes patrons to write a good review for a free roll (more below).  We walked in around 7:30 pm this past Thursday night. It was pretty empty with only 2 tables. We were seated at a booth & given menus. After browsing through the menus (make sure to also check out the meal specials that are in a display sign on the table), we ended up ordering:  Happy Hour Skewer Special, 3 for $5 (Happy Hour: Monday- Saturday, 7- 10 pm) Chicken Skewer- Ordered 2 of these. I was actually surprised with the amount of chicken I got for each skewer. The chicken had a good grilled taste. Because I had already filled up on the other food we ordered, I only had 1 of them & took the 2nd one to go.  Spicy Pork Skewer- Ordered 1 of these. My husband ate this & thought it was good.   Las Vegas Roll, $8 prior to tax (on Happy Hour Menu)- This roll was made with purple rice, which is a nice change from white. I liked the crunchy fried garlic on top of this & thought this was good. I was surprised with the amount of pieces this came with. This cut roll was pretty filling. I liked the sauces on this roll.  Shaggy Dawg Roll, $9 prior to tax (Happy Hour Menu)- This roll is also made with purple rice. Imitation crab is cut & draped over the rice that looked like a dog with long, shaggy hair (thus the name I suppose). Just like the Las Vegas roll, there was also a number of pieces that came in this cut roll. It was also filling. Although I did like the sauce on this roll, there is sirarracha sauce on top in case you don't do spicy like me (yes it was spicy for me so I stopped eating it).  LS12: Yellow Tail Roll with Ramen, $10 prior to tax- Originally my husband ordered a udon entrée, but changed it to this entrée after I saw the meal special menu on the table (which was pushed to the very back of the table, against the wall). You can order this meal special with udon instead if you do not want ramen. Anyways, this meal special also comes with a bowl of miso soup & a salad, which is quite a lot of food for $10.   The yellow tail roll comes with 8 pieces & also made with purple rice. But it was not rolled tightly and started to break down. I thought this roll was good.   The ramen was spicy (although the menu did not specify that it would be) and tasted like your typical ramen that you could get at the store and cook at home. But for $10, we weren't surprised by that.   For the salad, when I asked the server about that, she told us that it is self serve (there is a small salad bar at the bar). I wished the server who took our order (another server) would have told us this before hand. So my husband got up & plated a salad & gave it to me (I am such a salad fan). I was happy to see that they had the dark green leafys, but some of it was a little soggy & wished it was a little more fresh.  --------------------- (Total= $34.57, after tax, prior to tip)  Originally I was charged incorrectly & had to ask a server to fix it (our original server left for the evening). She fixed the error & said the other server had rung us up wrong.  Service was lacking. I also did not like that when we gave our server our order in the beginning that she saying 'what else' after each item. I thought that was kind of odd because we ordered quite a lot of items for just the 2 of us. Another thing that really bothered me was our server had brought over 1 of those small condiment dishes that has 1 compartment for ginger & the other for wasabi, the ginger was so measly & skimpy. The wasabi was just a few small little pieces instead of a larger amount. Not that I eat wasabi, but my husband & I thought it was odd to be given such an incredibly skimpy amount. Also what bothered & annoyed me was that with 2 people sitting at this table, she did not bother to bring us 2 of these condiment dishes. So when my husband asked for another 1, she asked 'for the sauce?' My husband said yes & so she brought me a large bowl instead. Why would I need a large bowl to dip my sushi in? Especially when she acknowledged that we need it for the sushi. This sever is either new or just wasn't thinking about what she was doing on this shift.   Although the food is good (and some of it being average), the server was much to be desired. I honestly would NEVER come back here.   By the way, about all of those 5 star reviews, there is a small sign on each table \"To our valued customers, if you are happy with our food and service, you will get a free menu item\", which you can choose from California roll, cucumber maki, salmon skin, spicy tuna Philadelphia, vegetable maki. In order to receive your free item, the review must be posted and shown to an employee (limit 2/ table). Being that this place is close to UNLV, this targets poor, hungry college students who would take advantage of this deal."}
{"text":"Great food. I recommend Shaggy Dawg and Las Vegas roll. Don't forget to try Ramen but less spicy :)..."}
{"text":"The quality of this place is consistently good, I love coming here. Order the two item bento it's awsome"}
{"text":"Great value for delicious food! As a student at UNLV, this is a place I stop by regularly. Lunch specials are great deals!  Ramen, sushi, bbq, lots of options here."}
{"text":"Bento boxes are cheap & delicious! Friendly service. Especially affordable & convenient for UNLV students. Definitely coming back with my friends. 10/10, I recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, decent price, they even surprised me with an early delivery!  UPDATE: I had them the following day and I was even more impressed."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! I have never physically been but I have ordered takeout off of my eat24 app dozens of times to both home and work. The sushi is extremely fresh and amazing. They've never forgotten a single thing and the food always arrives within the quoted time. I love the purple rice, such a fun little touch! I would recommend ordering here to anyone! Delicious food and amazing delivery service."}
{"text":"This place is super delicious and the service is amazing!! You have to check it out!! The five stars are there for a reason!! Good hours! And the sushi is so soft and just melts like it's supposed to!"}
{"text":"Awesome prices with awesome serving sizes. The servers are very tentative and constantly refilling empty drinks."}
{"text":"We tried this place and the food was decently priced and tasted great. Would come back again when we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not fresh . Albacore was frozen . Fish taste very fishy . Prices r high for poor quality. I won't be back"}
{"text":"I am so impressed with this place! I have ordered twice now with Eat 24 and I am blown away by the portions of food you recieve for such a low price. I ordered the Bento box with Chicken Curry and Katsu. They were so tasty but it also came with Miso soup,Salad,Gyoza,California roll and Veggie Tempura for $10. Such a great deal and Amazing flavor with everything in this Bento box. This is my new Favorite place to order from!! Just wish they had one close to my house so I could order it for dinner as well."}
{"text":"Tons of value! I recommend the 1 or 2 item bento for 8 or 10 dollars respectively! The box they serve it in is like a foot long by 5 inches. It's huge!"}
{"text":"My favorite place close to campus.  Generous specials,  fresh fish and excellent creations.   This is a great little spot for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, it looked amazing on the menu and the Yelp reviews were great. We were the first customers shortly after 11am and my boyfriend ordered the all you can eat menu and I ordered the $10 special crunch roll and udon noodles. After about 15 min they brought out two rolls for my boyfriend, we assumed they were the two that he ordered however he brought a third roll and found that they had originally given us the wrong roll, they gave us a yellowtail instead of caterpillar. Another 15 min goes by and other customers are getting all their rolls and soups, mind u I ordered just one roll and one soup and I got nothing. On top of that my boyfriend had ordered the oyster as part of his appetizer and they came out an hour after we arrived and they gave it to him last, the waiter seemed very new and didn't know how to answer one question without asking someone else. They seemed to have only one cook as the service was the worst and slowest I have ever experienced in my life. We were visiting from Orange County, ca and we will never come back here. And on top of that, the food was mediocre and they didn't provide any hot sauce salt and never checked on us to see if we were okay. Never again."}
{"text":"The service was nice and the food was filling but it wasnt anything special. But what itt lacks in any special qualities it makes up in atmosphere. Its small and intimate with really cool rice and music. Also the miso bowls are interesting.  Its set up like a normal japanese restaurant that gives you miso before the meal and they have a salad bar so that by the end of your meal you'll definitely be full. The menu is large and they have takoyaki which is hard to find so if you want a slightly different japanese dining experience come here."}
{"text":"Had Special menu, Ramen and spicy tuna roll, Udon and salmon teriyaki and added a california roll.  They use Korean style purple rice for rolls.  Ramen came with an egg.  Tasted like Shin Ramyun.  Salmon teriyaki was like a meal itself.  No problems overall.  Hoping for dessert."}
{"text":"Decent place to eat at if you're in the university area. They have an all-day special menu from 8$-12$. I ordered the salmon teriyaki with udon , miso soup and salad. I like that they serve purple rice here."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! I had the opportunity to come to Odolee. They have a really good value, especially with their special menu. Teriyaki salmon with salad, miso soup, and ramen for $8? It's not only fulfilling and inexpensive, but the food was also delicious. Service was fairly good as well. I will definitely be coming back in the near future!  Update: I still love coming here. Their specials are still one of the better deals in the surrounding area. :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. My friend suggested we meet for lunch since it was close by to her place of work. When I first walked in, it resembled that of a typical Korean restaurant. You look over to the sushi chefs and they're both Korean, and they're playing Korean music videos on the TV screens haha   The menu looked pretty good. They have an all day lunch special basically from open to close and its either 8-10-12 dollars depending on what you would like to get. The portions are huge too. I wanted to get a sushi roll as well but my friend advised me against it.. Good thing she did because I couldn't even finish my special! It comes with whatever dish you order, obviously, a ramen or using which is pretty big, and a miso soup. There is also  salad already on the plate. So yeah, the servings are pretty friendly too.   I got the katsu whish was really good. It wasn't sooo fried to the point where all the meat has disappeared. They also didn't smother the sauce all over the katsu which I really liked - it was just enough. My friend got the salmon and it was also very delicious. We both ended up getting the udon which was yummy! I'm.pretty sure the ramen would've been a good choice too.  They also have an AYCE option which is cool. The staff is very friendly and they also deliver!! Definitely check this place out people!!"}
{"text":"Can I not put a star here at all? I ordered through Eat24 for delivery in a hotel room and they delivered the food at the front desk without even saying who is it for and of course front desk wouldnt know who to call. 2 HOURS still no food. After contacting Eat24 thats when I knew that the food is already delivered and they did not even call to let us know. Who would wanna eat a COLD miso soup?? Of course i got a refund! Bad service!! And they forged signature too on their receipt!! Tsk tsk!!"}
{"text":"As always, the lunch is special is on point. Miso soup, salad bar, sushi roll and spicy korean ramen. They have all you can eat, but the lunch special is enough."}
{"text":"Really great specials! The ramen was good and the food I got was more than I expected for the $8 special! The $8 special I got consisted of miso soup, salad, ramen, pork katsu and rice. Definitely recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Tasty! Fresh and cant beat the prices! Their special menu is good! Salad bar is awesome"}
{"text":"Love the purple rice, Philadelphia roll is superb, the seaweed salad is delectable, and the staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the firecracker roll. It's a must try! Came on a busy time so service was slower than usual, but still worth it."}
{"text":"The food is really good and nicely priced, which as a college student I really like. I had the crunch roll with the udon and I really enjoyed both of them. My order also came with miso soup and there's a salad bar. Definitely coming back if I'm at school craving some sushi or udon!"}
{"text":"Oodolee is the best place to go for lunch social ever. Only $8 with free salad, a choice of ramen or udon, and a variety of meat and rice combo to choose from. More than that, lunch special applies for the whole day! So hurry and come try this place out!"}
{"text":"Food here was delicious and big portions for a great price.   Ordered the 3 portion combo for $12 and Combo E for $10 and the Las Vegas roll $8 (tasted amazing) with my boyfriend. They have happy hour Mon-Sat 7pm-11pm. Also, all the sushi is served with black rice which is my favorite. (Tastes like regular rice but it's purple and healthier for you).  The large strawberry sake (rice wine) is a big portion, so if you are just two people the small should be enough.   Would definitely come back here! ;)"}
{"text":"Very Nice wait staff. Ordered the Spider Roll it was great ! I would come again! :) Happy Sushing!"}
{"text":"Great value for the meal! When you get the $8 special, you get an entree, soup, salad, and another menu item."}
{"text":"It's a great deal, 8 bucks for a 4 course meal.   This place does a lot of food very cheaply, the food delivered isn't the best quality but it's good enough.  I go there frequently and order the specials or happy hour specials. There really isn't any kind of ambience or personality to the restaurant. Service staff seems to change constantly, which means inconsistent service, sometimes good sometimes bad.  I definitely recommend it for a late night bite with friends, it's a good chill place with acceptable food.  The salad bar can surprise you."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about, honestly. Maybe drunk college kids come in for a cheap meal...but the thing is...it's not cheap.  I ordered delivery from Yelp. I ordered one udon soup, yellow tail sashami, one roll with mango, and an order of gyzoa.   The udon soup was fine. Ediable. Good broth. The noodles were good. Shrimp tempura tasted fine, but was soggy. Tons and tons of broccoli. Kind of offputting. The gyzoa was mushy on the inside in a way I've never experienced before. Still tasted okay. The yellowtail sashami was actually pretty good. Thick, fresh tasting. The mango roll I got was gross. TONS OF imitation crab, no scallops at all, the mango tasted like fish and the salmon and dried and not fresh at ALL.   All this for like 53 dollars lol. I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great food. Love the ramen. Definitely will come again soon Recommended for everyone. Very cheap good on  my wallet"}
{"text":"Very bad service!!!!  Food served 30 mins after we got a table. Soup takes more than 30 mins then to find out that the cook forgot to make the soup!!! Never come back here. Food not good as well."}
{"text":"The food and the service was good. I was able to eat a decent meal for only 8 dollars. Also, it is not that busy in the afternoons. So, you don't have to worry about not having a place to sit."}
{"text":"So I have been swayed into loving this place. My friends and I were going to go to Roberto's but that wasn't a unanimous decision. We can't here instead. I wasn't all the way for it until they brought out the complimentary miso soup and then our food arrived. The teriyaki special is so delicious and the ramen that it comes with is such a large serving. Everything is yummy and the server is the sweetest. I'm probably going to be late for work for this, but eh my days going way better because this place."}
{"text":"Good service! The food is really good and the 8$ dinner meals are a really good deal!!!  Also gives a student discount. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and not expensive. And the portion is enough too.I had the lunch special with ramen and spider roll."}
{"text":"Super nice place. The staff are great and friendly. As soon as you go in everyone greets you with a smile. The food is awesome and authentic."}
{"text":"Nope I didn't enjoy this place at all!!!!! It's 2am and j finally stop throwing up and i ate there around 6pm and with in the hour got sick like a dog... On top of that If you order all you can eat and leave 2 pieces on the table they will tell you straight up if you don't eat those two pieces we have to charge you for it smh that's so stupid ... And I don't think rice should be purple ever ... They were very slow and didn't pay attention .. Never will I ever eat here again !!!!"}
{"text":"This is very creative sushi.  We ordered it pretty late, close to midnight and it was delicious!  It's definitely unique compared to most sushi places in town.  As a person who probably eats sushi twice a week this is a cool spot.  The Heat Roll & Burrito Roll were my favorite."}
{"text":"This place is great. Decently priced with generous portions! It's walking distance from campus and they  provide fast service. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This places is really  nice and clean I love the sushi that this people make I go there  all the the time to have a good lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"The grilled steak is great. The only thing is that they don't have pictures of food item. I'll come again."}
{"text":"The special menu is so delicious and good amount of food for a great price. Definitely coming back. Also the employees are very nice."}
{"text":"Food is great,  especially considering the price.  The server was helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Good service with friendly price. I order $12 special plate with soup and all you can eat salad."}
{"text":"The ramean was to spicey to eat. Neither of us were able to eat it. We like spicey food. We didn't ask for it spicey. No refund was offered."}
{"text":"Excellent service is just a part of this restaurant the sushi is to die for. We're visiting from California and were making this our new stop every time! Sushi is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Gah, I have been here twice and I have truly enjoyed their specials. They have sushi roll specials the come with salad and miso soup. The staff serves food in a timely manner and the layout is pretty nice.  The first time I came, I was one of two people out of a party of 5 that actually ate. The other members just ordered drinks. During this stay, we had a meeting the lasted way too long and the staff did not mind that we loitered. I know they want to keep their customers happy and I like how they allowed non-eating members to join us at the table.   The second time I came, everyone in my party was hungry. We were seated at a table that was a little too squished on the left hand corner of the business. The service was well and the food was pretty good. My husband and I both bought a sushi roll combo (the Vegas and Burrito roll). This was not as great as other sushi restaurants we have ordered from because the rolls felt a little heavy, but it was definitely on par with fast food sushi joints like Jaburritos.  Alright, here is the kicker that dropped it down from 4 stars. My friend actually killed a baby roach that was crawling on the wall near our table. We don't want to say that this play is infested with roaches, but I am a bit disturbed by it. After that happened my husband couldn't even eat any more of the food. We didn't box it up and I am not honestly sure if we will come back.  I suppose I could have mentioned it to the staff, but we didn't want to cause a seen over a potential anomaly roach. There are just way to many places to go to than to put up with bugs or even wonder about them."}
{"text":"They give a lot of food for the price for the lunch special, it's well worth it. And it's not just quantity, it tastes pretty good too. And it's close enough to the university, so I recommend it to all fellow poor college students that want a balanced meal"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great & cheap place to eat near UNLV this is the place to go. It's very clean and their quick & friendly service is beyond what I expected. The food is good and the prices are very reasonable. I'll definitely be coming back to Oodolee."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite sushi bar in vegas! Your choice of ramen or u don't soup as well as a bowl of miso  soup. A fresh salad bar with your lunch special and a roll of your choice. All this for $8"}
{"text":"Very close to the campus. It has some great deals. Self-serve salads are offered which has lettuce, seaweed, and cucumber. The service is really fast."}
{"text":"This place tastes amazing and the food is delicious. I really like the terrayaki chicken. It so good. I really enjoy this place and the ambience. It a good place for a group of friends to eat. Everyone very sweet staff wise. We got complimentary miso soup"}
{"text":"Okay as an avid sushi eater who has eaten at many different places, I must say this restaurant has the best sushi I have ever had! The Las Vegas roll was truly incredible! They have purple rice which is pretty cool. The service was super fast! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great prices and yummy food. Offers UNLV student discounts. Definitely check it out! :)"}
{"text":"This place is great! $8 for a roll, soup, noodles, and all you can eat salad! And if you write a Yelp review you get a free roll. Clean place with good prices. Staff is also very nice  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered pork katsu and ramen today for only $8! I enjoyed the service and food tasted delicious! :) Love it!"}
{"text":"Worst ramen ever. Like the kind you get in the asian grocery with the plastic wrapper. Same thing but 12 dollars. Lame."}
{"text":"So pleased to find a delicious sushi place for an affordable price while we were here in Vegas! We had been living off of American food for the past week and were craving fresh fish, and I'm glad we found this place.   We ordered the different sashimi combos, the Las Vegas roll, and the tempura udon. The fish was fresh and tasty, the udon well-made, and the roll was ok. The purple rice lent an interesting taste to the dishes.  Service was excellent - very pleasant and helpful. :) definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The special menu is such a deal! Salad, ramen/udon and a full course for under $10! :D close to unlv so perfect for students!"}
{"text":"I seriously cannot say enough good things about this place! From their PURPLE rice and fresh ingredients to their friendly waitstaff, I will keep returning for sure. Not sure if they're still running the promotion, but my first time here they gave me a Dungeness crab. A WHOLE CRAB. For free! On top of my already super fresh and delicious dinner! Mind = blown. Have I mentioned their lunch specials? I just got a yellowtail roll, a bowl of shrimp tempura udon, salad bar, miso soup, and green tea for $10. They have other specials starting at $8. These specials run from 11-4 (I think) every weekday! I never want to leave this place!"}
{"text":"We ordered a large bento box and baked roll for home delivery.  Both beef dishes has really cheap and dried beef with a lot of gristle. it looked like they also marinated it upon order, the beef had no internal flavor, it was so dry! The portions were also very small. Our miso coup had 2 pieces of tofu also.  The baked roll was actually pretty well done. So I guess they have a sushi chef or a different person handling this. So well done to them.  Kinda ruined our valentines day and after paying $30 with tip, thankfully I can say I will never eat here again. It's cheap eats for high prices."}
{"text":"My first time being here and I am stuffed with only 8$! What an incredible deal. The food is pretty good, the pork katsu was good just a little cool. Overall great for you buck."}
{"text":"We go to many sushi places and this one was the worst!! The waitress was nice but the quality of the sushi was disgusting. My husband eats raw and his food tasted old and super chewy. I only eat cooked sushi and it tasted refrigerated and had plastic on it. We have bad stomachaches, never again"}
{"text":"We saw this place near us on Eat24 and decided to run over for some AYCE.  One cool point of the restaurant is the purple rice. They use a certain wild rice that is healthier than white rice which makes it quite different than normal sushi joints! The nigiri is super yummy and their tempura ice cream is awesome! They also have specials if you don't feel like all you can eat! Being right near UNLV gives some perks as well! We will definitely be back! The server who helped us was super sweet and answered any questions we had!  If they keep this up, we may become regulars! :)"}
{"text":"Good place to eat if you're in the UNLV area and they have a \"odolee special menu\" which I recommend for just eating for lunch or dinner since they are open till midnight or if you're in the area and want all you can eat then they have the same price as everywhere else. Also their rice is purple which is just a healthier option for rice in Korea"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has 4 stars.. everything about this was wrong! Come on Yelp peeps, you have let me down on this one. It's cool they try to use black rice for the healthier option, but they should give people the option to choose instead of automatically assuming its ok to substitute regular sushi rice. The salmon in my roll, tasted ridiculously fishy.. it was pretty gross. The nigiri... the fish all tasted like cardboard.. like it was frozen in cardboard... then defrosted... completely disgusting. The fish were also cut improperly.. no-no. Never again. Toodeloo, Oodolee."}
{"text":"I have never written a review. Good or bad. Just not my style. Thank god I ordered through GrubHub. They added points because this restaurant refused to refund my order, I felt it necessary to express my concern because they are not going to express concern for their own customers.  *i didn't call the restaurant because GrubHub says to call them so they can deal with it. Had I know this was some sort of procedure I would have happily called the restaurant.  *I got purple rice. Even if that's a thing it's weird and it looks like Barney took a crap in it.   *their reasoning for not refunding my food was because of assumptions they made like I \"must have eaten it\" and \"didn't return it to the store\" while working 9-5 having to be a college student afterwards... or \"I didn't call them\"... (which has already been explained as grubhub requests you to contact them) soooooo Here's a picture of your uneaten food in the trash....??  *It had a strong aftertaste of banana. It was like warm and just overall not good.   I hope your customer service warms up a bit. I am very easy going and this could have been an easy call to express concern regarding your business but your complete brush off kind of pissed me off.  Show more interest in your customers feedback. They make or break you..."}
{"text":"I've always hear about this place and finally got the chance to try it! Customer service seems really nice and the combos and specials are pretty good deals. Checking into Yelp gets you a free roll/entree. It's a pretty good place for lunch"}
{"text":"Second time coming here, and have now made it a point to come here whenever I'm in town. The amount of good food you get for the price is unmatched!"}
{"text":"Yikes. How can people give this place a good rating? We came in and nobody was there, and the service was so horrible. Our servers were so confused with our orders each time. The sushi rice was mixed with forbidden rice so it looked purple and the tempura was awful."}
{"text":"Big portion for not a lot. Food was great. The salmon in the bento box was delicious. The salad bar is small but adorable and delicious."}
{"text":"Horrible. The cooks took way too long. The fish is old and I felt like I wasted time and money. Don't go here. Please. I never write posts about places and I had to. It's seriously awful food."}
{"text":"I live near UNLV so it's very convenient for me to go here and have sushi. The sushi is fresh and well done. Not much to complain about other dishes as they are all decent. The miso soup is also good.   All in all, not the most mind-blowing Jiro-like sushi experience ever, but it's convenient for UNLV and the food is good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not terrible but if you're going to splurge on all you can eat sushi this is not the place to do it. The specials seem like a great deal for lunch but the sushi was definitely sub-par. The fish was fresh-ish, I'm not concerned about getting sick or anything but defiantly NOT the freshness I expect. Also they use a ton of rice and a TON of SUPER creamy crab inside of the California roll based rolls so if ends up being a big creamy, gummy mouthful (not so appealing). Even the Mochi wasn't good, frozen way too hard and the rice late was hard."}
{"text":"Needing a quick, small bite before heading to a show at Ham Hall on the UNLV campus, I found myself at Oodolee Sushi and Grill. This was back in early June and it wasn't much cooler inside than it was outside. The first thing going through my head was, \"I hope they're able to keep their fish cool.\" Because warm sushi is flat out gross.  I opted for their Sushi Combo 'A' ($12). Tuna, salmon, albacore, white fish, and shrimp nigiri with a spicy tuna roll. They use a mixture of white and forbidden rice, giving it a pinkish color. Personally, it didn't look that appetizing, and it tasted of low quality fish and disappointment. The albacore was the best of the bunch, while everything else was largely forgettable."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite all you can eat sushi place in Las Vegas. The quality of fish is amazing. They have really great and quick service. It is worth driving into the city from Henderson."}
{"text":"My worst fears for this place have become a reality! I will NOT be returning. *gasp* On my recent visit I brought some family from out of town to show off what I thought to be an awesome eatery until.... I saw a cockroach!!! My family immediately told our waitress and she killed it but did not seem very surprised which was unnerving. We were already eating and at that point we could not eat anymore, being that we always pay regardless of any circumstances, we asked for the check and paid. With no effort from the business to apologize or pay notice to the unfortunate event that took place I was so let down and extremely embarrassed. I wanted to take a picture but I was in such shock and lost my appetite so did not think of doing so. My hope in writing this review is to inform and make aware that we may have only seen one cockroach but those that we don't may be many.   Note: THE ONLY REASON THEY HAVE SUCH GREAT REVIEWS IS BECAUSE THEY OFFER FREE FOOD FOR A REVIEW THAT YOU MUST SHOW YOUR WAITER"}
{"text":"good sushi, good location for student. U can have free deserts when u write yalp . Place not small"}
{"text":"Great food, and Great service! They are open until midnight so if you are someone that knows they got the midnight munches, they will hook you up! It's also conveniently located next to the UNLV."}
{"text":"This place is very delicious with great prices and they close at midnight which is just great!! It is definitely a must to stop by at!"}
{"text":"First time here! Very convenient location near the university. It's a great change of venue from the busier sushi restaurants. Friendly staff and great atmosphere! Price and menu options are pretty diverse and budget friendly especially for college students!  Will definitely come back here again in the future!"}
{"text":"Didn't do the all you can eat, but the food was delicious!   My friends order the bento box and they were bigger than we imagined.    Get the baked scallop! And try to the green crunch if you're in the avocado mood!   Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! Fast service and very good price! Their sushis are authentic with the purple rice, have not seen that anywhere else - simply unique! Thanks for the good quality of food you guys always offer! Must try, thanks oodolee sushi and grill! Super fast delivery with EAT24, GrubHub or Online Restaurants!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi for $19 but it's not a buffet set-up. It's order as you go, off a menu. Everything's made to order, fresh. Huge, 2 page menu- good variety to choose from - from udon, nigiri, rolls, tempura and desert. Great value. Friendly, welcoming Nd clean establishment. Would return."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this restaurant with Eat24 at least 4 times now in the last 2 weeks. Their strength would be in their sushi! Their fish is so fresh, I did not expect such high quality from a delivery restaurant. The quality is up there with fine dining sushi restaurants but their prices are like the cheap hole in the wall sushi joint! It's the perfect combo of high quality and low prices for sushi.  *they do use purple rice, not that it makes a difference in taste... So it will look odd, but I've actually grown quite fond of it!  Weakness: their beef teriyaki, short ribs, and ramen are less than average. The meats were extraordinarily fatty, and the ramen first came with little broth and the second time came with a watered down broth. The combo of beef teriyaki and ramen, however, only cost $10, so it's a really good deal.  I have no idea where this place is located but should I want to go out for sushi, this place will be top on my list."}
{"text":"I went here to have AYCE sushi with one of my friends visiting from California. It wasn't really that busy around lunchtime, but when we entered we were greeted by the staff in a cheerful manner. We were then promptly seated by the waitress and given the menus.  The price for AYCE isn't bad; it's cheaper than other sushi places around the area. It's probably a good marketing strategy because it's right across from UNLV and I feel like most of the clientele are college students.   I liked the sushi rolls, but I've honestly had better. The rolls were made with purple rice, which is a unique twist to sushi because I've never seen that done before. The rolls that I enjoyed here were the Las Vegas and the Spider rolls.  There were other rolls that weren't as good like the Hawaii roll, which is a basic California roll topped with tuna. I know, I know... some people don't classify a California roll as sushi, but I didn't want to get anything too crazy. When this roll came out, I noticed the tuna on top was darker in color than normal. The discoloration made me feel that the fish used in the roll wasn't fresh. Total appetite killer.  I think the little side orders of food (listed under the \"Starter\" section of the AYCE menu) were better than the rolls, in my opinion. Definitely try the baked scallop and the baked green mussel. The baked scallop had a creamy, soft texture. It's rich in flavor and can fill you up easily. The baked mussels were probably the best baked mussels I've had in a while! They're packed with flavor and they practically melted in my mouth.  I think this place is average. If you're balling on a budget and are craving AYCE sushi, then this is your spot. Some of the rolls were a hit or miss, but overall Oodolee is just okay."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick place to grab a bite to eat while waiting for our flight to go home. Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Good food & quick service!! Super nice server"}
{"text":"THE ONLY REASON THEY HAVE GOOD REVIEWS IS BECAUSE THEY OFFER A FREE DESSERT IF YOU SHOW THEM YOUR YELP REVIEW.  When we went is was an hour before closing. They must have mentioned the fact that they were closing about 4 times. Even someone who appeared to be the owner or manager went to our table to tell us they were closing! My friend and I literally ordered only 2 rolls, which were both terrible. They put too much stuff on their rolls. Instead of all the flavors coming together, I couldn't even eat more than one piece. $14 per roll that weren't even good. I will NEVER come back to this place."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go if you're tired of on campus food.  Great food. 10/10 with rice. Would eat again"}
{"text":"Came here on a lunch break with my coworkers after a long morning and the lunch special menu definitely eased the tedious Tuesday work day. From customer service to the quality of food and the greatly priced menu, everything was a deserved 5 star! My personal favorite is the salmon teriyaki along with the open salad bar that's included with the order. I'm all about the healthy life style and this meal was the perfect balance!"}
{"text":"Discovered this cute place by accident when I was visiting UNLV. Foods have quite authentic taste (speaking as a half Japanese and half Chinese..) and I really enjoyed it! They also have many creative soju and sake that look very delicious (strawberry flavor and Yuzu flavor). A perfect place for weekend or after work/class gathering with friends!"}
{"text":"Grilled meats and katsu were dry and over-cooked. Disappointing and not worth the price."}
{"text":"Decent pricing and portions, fast service. However, waitress dropped food on the tray and tried to play it off by walking back to the kitchen and 2 seconds later coming back and saying that she \"fried us a new piece of calamari\" Clearly, she went back there and put it on a new plate and walked right back out. Other than that, I would come back again. Also a plus that they deliver."}
{"text":"Sorry, but the food just wasn't that good.  The cgicken tereyaki was good, but i wouldnt judge a sushi place by thqy.  Most of the fish looked kinda colorless.  It was a bit disconcerning.  Granted it was a Sunday night, not a good night for sushi  in less than a prime place.  I didn't even eat some of if as it was grayish in color.  I've  had a sort of icky feeling since last night. I'd  look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Happened to walk by this place and was pleasantly surprised. Great food (they have a salad bar too), good prices, and BIG portions. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, awesome K pop videos/music, spacious and the food was tasty.  The price is very reasonable for the quality! For all you waiting in line for 45 minutes at the all u can eat sushi place on flamingo ( I'm not giving out the name)...suckers!!!"}
{"text":"Truly excellent service. The staff was very pleasant and quick to serve. The food was also delicious and very reasonably priced.  I've been to almost every sushi place in the valley and can say without doubt that this ranks among the best of them.   Well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Combo D--5 nigiri and a specialty roll of your choice.  Very good food at a very good price. (With a drink, my order came to just over $15.)"}
{"text":"Very nice place.  Clean, quick service, and very tasty spicy tuna poke salad.  I will update when I get another chance to eat here, as this was a quick stop for a snack.   I will definitely repeat.  They are open to customizing food for those that like very spicy food."}
{"text":"We all ordered something off of the Oodolee special menu. Here are the highlights: Fresh salad bar. That's a plus, especially with fresh greens, seaweed salad, and fruits.    Spider Roll: it's made of soft shell crab. Also has avocado, eel sauce, sprouts. A little too much eel sauce but still one of the better spider rolls I've had.  Salmon teriyaki: the simplicity and cleanliness of the food presentation was really appealing. I really like how the salmon was cooked. Skin was crispy and so good to eat. Devoured it in minutes.  Hamachi Kama: grilled fish collar.  Amazingly good. No sauce needed. Definitely would order again. I'm a fan now.   Tonkotsu plate: Nice and crispy with an interesting sauce. However, the fried katsu gets a bit rich after a while.  Ramen: super hot and spicy. I added the shredded cabbage that came with my salmon plate and it tasted better.  If you like spicy, this is for you.   Udon: kind of standard, but nice with vegetables and an added shrimp tempura.  Service is superb. Our server is really nice and cute.  Very reasonable price, considering the sizeable portions. Happy hour Mon to Sat 7PM to 11PM.  They're also streaming my now favorite cool Korean pop music while having our delicious dinner,  What else can one ask for? We're all happy, full and satisfied.  Thumbs up!!! Yeah!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. The combos And specials are pretty cheap and you get a good bang for your buck. There's not a lot of other options around school but you can't go wrong. And a salad bar! Definitely coming back:)"}
{"text":"Love Oodolee~ come here many times for lunch after classes.  Good pricing for lunch with good proportions~!"}
{"text":"Great food, service, and price ! Give it a try ! I had the beef teriyaki lunch special and plan on coming back ..."}
{"text":"I did not have their AYCE but they had a good special for a light supper... we had combination sushi with choice of udon or ramen for only $8 or $10 or $12, depending on what type of sushi you choose. It was a bargain and the food was good! It is located right across Maryland from the UNLV campus where we had a conference, so we just walked across the street to have our dinner before going back to our conference activities."}
{"text":"Came here by chance because the other sushi place we had intended to go had a crazy long wait and was pleasantly surprised by everything.  All you can eat includes so much!  The tuna poke salad and sashimi salad were great!  Service was incredibly fast and the staff was nice.  We had 5 specialty rolls and a few other more basic items and not a bad comment could be said about any of them. The Las Vegas special roll was my favorite.  Definitely coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"It's my first time here and I'm impressed by the cleanliness of this restaurant. Our server Yongwoo was very welcoming and made our visit very enjoyable. The food was great and there is happy hour from 7-11 pm everyday except Sunday."}
{"text":"As a graduate student, I am always looking for a decent meal at a pocket-friendly price. Oodolee has provided just that! Now, it's reasonable to ask, \"why don't you just eat more dollar menu?\" We're students, not animals. The sushi is fresh, the miso is perfectly hot, and the ramen has been on point every single time. I typically don't enjoy the egg added to Japanese soups. The ones included in the broth are fluffy and the furthest thing from vile. So glad that we have a place so close to campus... It's just a walk away!"}
{"text":"Great service, great deal!! 8$ for sushi and choice of udon or ramen!! All u can eat salad bar too!! Try the ginger dressing! Its amazing!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials! Tons of a food for cheap, a must for the strapped diner! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Really good, I like that they have purple rice. If you go to UNLV their lunch special is definitely worth a try id say it's worth it even for the salad bar. You even get food for writing a review!  Also the quality of fish and rice is surprisingly so good. I would recommend this to my mother."}
{"text":"Very professional! This business does well to treat their customers right. We had a mix up and did not specify that we wanted AYCE which we later found out has different portion sizes than the entree size. They have bomb sushi and its AYCE. Their rice is purple, don't know, don't care, but it's so tasty! Maybe I do want to know.   The point is, the place has standards and they keep them. I like this place even when it comes to the funky bathroom decor. I like these kind of places that are central, funky and primarily have bomb food! Will definitely be back and will recommend as always. Thank you oodles Oodolee!  ¡Viva la AYCE!"}
{"text":"The burrito roll was rich and tasty, boyfriend really likes the Raman (spicy); we had a great experience tonight.  Enjoyed some happy hour items and one of the specials with roll/raman Do yourself a favor- try the stuffed mushrooms! Loved them!  Service was good.  AND* Their dinner menu DOES have sushi roll ingredients...maybe just the lunch menu doesn't."}
{"text":"The customer service was great. I enjoyed the special menu. The food is totally worth the price. I highly recommend coming here to eat."}
{"text":"We tried the Philadelphia, Las Vegas, volcano and California rolls. As well as the ramen and udon. All are delicious and are large size portions (8 pieces per roll)"}
{"text":"Not a fan at all.   First it took over a hour for our food to be delivered. I ordered miso soup with clams all but 1 clam was under cooked completely closed. Our shrimp/ calamari tempura was soggy, and the rolls we ordered was just ok. Why only 1 star? Cause for $64 dollars we should've got more than 8 pieces of calamari, my clams should've been open and this meal shouldn't have forced me to go eat at Burger King afterwards."}
{"text":"I love this place.Fast service and purple rice for sushi and complimentary 5 salads.Prices are amazing."}
{"text":"The BBQ short ribs is good. The Bento Box is great! :) I like the California Roll and Combo A for three is enough. The salad bar has seaweed salad! Besides, this restaurant is really close to UNLV, great place for students."}
{"text":"I went again today, because like I said:  This is my new go-to sushi place.  Boy was I wrong.  I have no idea what the hell happened from a month ago where I first went versus today.  I had TERRIBLE service.  I was extremely baffled.  It started out horrible right from the beginning.   Our waiter brought over the water, but didn't bring any straws.  I asked for a straw right when he brought the water.  Do you know when I received from straw?  Five minutes later.    It just went down hill from there.  Half of the things we ordered didn't even get to the table, but it was definitely listed on the check.  My brother ordered a tempura udon and waited almost forty minutes for it to come out.  Once it was out, the waiter dropped the spoon in the soup and picked it out with his hand.  Another waiter then brought it over to my brother.  I told my brother not to eat it because of what I saw.  I then had it taken back.  Our water glasses were pretty much empty the entire time we were there.  I had to scream across the restaurant to get attention from one of the water to have my water glass filled.  They were pretty much messing around and having conversations with each other instead of doing their jobs.  THEY LITERALLY STARED AT MY WATER CUP CONTINUOUSLY AND TOTALLY DISREGARDED THE FACT THAT IT WAS EMPTY.   You know what the funny part is?  There were a few people that came in thirty minutes after we got there, yelling about writing a yelp review for a free dessert.  And guess what the wait staff did?  Yes, they ended up spending most of their time making sure that they got their food in a timely matter and that their water glasses was filled.  Ridiculous.    NEVER going back ever again.  HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE STAFF.  NEVER AGAIN.  I didn't tip, nor do I feel bad about it.  I was so distraught about the entire situation, I wanted to go to the kitchen and get my own food and go to the POS to pay my own bill.  HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE."}
{"text":"I wonder how others rate this place so high.  First, the service is good . Our server is new and she's forgetful. But she is kind and serve with smiles. I can always forgive nice people. But if you are rude and with an attitude, I will make it hard for you as well.  We came in around noon for $19.99 all you can eat sushi. They weren't busy at the time, only 4 tables, and we were the only one getting all you can eat. After we placed the order, it took 10 minutes for the first item to come and half of our order never came.   Please look at the photos I post, the quality of the fish is very bad. You can tell that the fish are dried, the glossy oil is gone. And the taste is average . We order all of their sushi items, and yes, they were dried.  I would recommend this place to anyone. There are many better places around."}
{"text":"My goto sushi place close to home. They are very generous with the sashimi - thick, fresh slices that melt in your mouth like butter.  We made it just in time to still get the lunch AYCE special. As much as I'd love to eat my money's worth, the rolls are huge and very filling. I got two half-rolls in and some Albacore before I was stuffed. Jim barely finished two rolls. They were both absolutely amazing, next time we'll just order the rolls so we can take the leftovers home!"}
{"text":"This place is good, AYCE, very tasty strawberry rice wine. Starts filling up about 8pm. Live crab and clams. 1 hour limit to eating but much was accomplished in 1 hour. Kids had a great time. Very good poke salad. Yummy, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Literally the best sushi I've eaten wasn't expecting this place and I am one to complain or not review average this place is bomb ass don't f-n cheap out buy the special rolls they are special for a reason shhhh it    Is great"}
{"text":"First time here for lunch. Got the $8 special with salad, miso soup, entree, and a ramen or udon. GREAT deal for the price. Food is great! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I came in about 9 right before they closed. They were super nice and servers were friendly. It reminds me of an old pizza parlor so it had a very casual vibe which I liked.  I got three rolls in the $24 all you can eat(cheaper to do that vs buying the rolls separately): First was the Kamikaze. It had a good helping of fish and a nice chunk of jalapeño. I generally don't like tempura rolls but this one had a really light tempura and wasn't over breaded.  Second was the Red devil. Sooooo good. I like that they weren't afraid to pile on the sriracha.  Third, was my favorite. The Ninja. The albacore melts in your mouth and all the flavors worked well together. The garlic chip on top felt weird on my teeth but was a good addition to the roll.  Next time in I'm in Vegas I'll definitely be back and I would definitely recommend to friends traveling there. Close to the strip(need to drive though) and had a good amount of parking available. Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving sushi but were stuck at work so this place was the closest one and like it says deliver so why not try it. Its near where we work but too lazy to go and drive coz of the traffic near unlv. But yeah its fast and Idk why but the rice is purple lol  I never seen that before but its pretty lol. Hopefully taste good."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times this semester, and have had no bad experiences. The waitress was very nice when she sat us down and when we gave her our order. The price is definitely a plus, because they offer an entree with your choice of spicy ramen or spicy udon for $8. Though the soup has been hit or miss. It's a nice little place worth checking out. All you can eat sushi lunch is $20 and dinner is $24. Be sure to check out the happy hour from 7pm-11pm. Sake!"}
{"text":"This place is my go-to for sushi when I'm on campus. It beats the over priced sushi they serve at UNLV. It's a lot fresher too. I love their purple rice & complimentary salad (I always get seaweed) Kai is a sweetheart! Highly recommend if you're in the area"}
{"text":"I have come ti this place a couple Of times and it's always good,nice poéticos and they use wild rice!!! I had to Post this because for 8dls i hoy a trip to The salad bar, miso with seafood and 3 nigiri!'bn yes You Heard right 8 dls!!!! And its all premium"}
{"text":"Dine-in or Delivery... I like the Spicy Korean Ramen. I always get a special roll or teriyaki salmon that includes this as a combo. Salad bar is simple but delicious (the only seaweed salad I like). Usually empty or not a lot of people dinning when I go, but I like the quiet. This place is decent for the price (cheap). Sometimes better than others."}
{"text":"Good service and good value with half price all you can eat sushi for kids, many yummy options!  4 banana rating from the kids!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The special here is incredible. 8-10-12 special all day contains choice of sushi roll, ramen soup, salad and miso. You have to check it out! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! Best deal for ramen and sushi. Perfect place to come for lunch. I come here so much that the waitress knows my order!"}
{"text":"We wanted some sushi that delivered to our hotel. This location had a bunch of reviews and good star rating so we figured there was no way we wouldn't enjoy the food. We were wrong. The only positive thing was the delivery man. He was courteous and on time. The food was not what we had hoped. They were over soaked in sauces and the ingredients didn't taste fresh. Even the simple ones like spicy tuna and Philadelphia roll were off and those are hard to mess up. I stopped eating less than half way thru because it was just that bad. I threw up a little of it this morning too. Yuck.   I figured the calamari would at least be decent. They were in sticks and tasted like fish sticks. Very disappointing. The restaurant did provide ample ginger, wasabi, soy and chopsticks. Because of their delivery man and the well packed order, they get two stars instead of one, otherwise it was a no Bueno experience. My husband felt the same.   Also, they charge $6 for delivery."}
{"text":"Great place, really good food and best value! Happy hour and value menu till late almost every day."}
{"text":"Good food for a good price. They have lunch/dinner specials from $8-12. Good customer service and they are really nice. The restaurant's interior design is pretty nice to, very comfortable and clean. And they do delivery! So order up  We will definitely dine in again."}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi , the items on a menu are not what actually is served. A baked scallop roll is served cold. Yuck. Specialty rolls promise several  fishes only deliver measly imitation crab mixed with sweet sauces. Ewww that's not sushi. That's why it was completely empty when I went on a Friday night. I would never come back."}
{"text":"I like that this restaurant has vegetarian options. They have a vegetable roll and tofu as an appetizer. Both were very good. Would recommend! Go here!"}
{"text":"I just had lunch here with a friend. I loved how close it was to UNLV and the sushi was really fresh. I loved the salmon nigirii. The ramen was different and a little too spicy for me. I just recently went again with my boyfriend and every customer seemed to be having problems. The wait time for food was long and most of the food orders were wrong or things were missing. The quality of the food was still good, but the customer service was abominable. The complaints that they received were ignored and it took us 30 minutes to get served."}
{"text":"I asked them to make me a custom roll and they did it perfectly! Service was really good too. I asked lots of questions about the menu and the waiter was able to answer them with no hesitation."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Great sushi, salad, and service!!! I love the rice they use in the sushi rolls. Plus, they have Scottish Salmon which is the bomb! I'm glad I yelped this place. Highly recommend as a sushi stop. The staff is very friendly and polite."}
{"text":"the fish was fresh, the rice is purple and tasty, and the prices are great.  it's a good place for students to come and eat."}
{"text":"It was really good and affordable! I definitely would recommend it and best of all it's near UNLV."}
{"text":"This place has very delicious ramen and udon, their teriyaki chicken was very appetizing and I do recommend this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service and great food. Recommend this place to everyone. Cheap lunch specials and bento boxes. Never been to a place this great."}
{"text":"Its so awesome!! I love this place!!!! Sushi is super bomb and the price is right!!! :) its so worth it"}
{"text":"Pretty good and reasonably priced, the menu is kinda weird, needs to be better organized.but  food is really good"}
{"text":"High quality sushi at a good price and really good service, especially for a business so close to UNLV.  Definitely one of my favorite spots to come for lunch now.  They have a bunch of reasonably priced combos for whatever you may feel like eating."}
{"text":"Good food and delicious dessert!!! Love this place~  Great deal at the lunch special!"}
{"text":"The food was great; the service was a little lacking. Perhaps it was a cultural thing; but it took a long time for them to take our order, get the food out, get us our check, etc."}
{"text":"This joint deserves negative stars!! Grey rice, slimy fish, rancid ginger and edemame that looked like it was somebody's half eaten leftovers!! BEWARE."}
{"text":"Have been ordering from Oodolee for about a year now! Had it delivered to me first without even going to the restaurant first, and was immediately impressed. A lot of people are shocked by the purple rice but I liked it. Favorite place to go in Vegas, and I suggest this sushi restaurant to other fans of fish that are friends of mine!"}
{"text":"The prices are awesome, the food is delicious. I would definitely take a girl here for a date."}
{"text":"I love eating here! It's cheap and it's closeby. I love getting the lunch specials here. They give you so much for a small price and thats pretty great for being a broke college student. I usually get lunch special 3 which is salmon, tun and yellowfish sashimi with miso, salad and ramen. All for only $8."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago and the service was awesome. The food was fresh and it's definitely one of my favorite sushi places. Recommend to any sushi lover!"}
{"text":"I do understand that they do offer free food with a good review but this place is honestly A1. I had the all you can eat lunch and there were no weird rules and limits. Just finish most of it. Which is easy to do so because of how delicious it is. Would eat here again."}
{"text":"I love coming here! The music is always great and the people are always so nice. The first time i came here my stomach was so happy i just had to come back the next. I recommend the special menu. Filling and affordable."}
{"text":"I should've known this place was going to be bad when they offer you free food to give them a good review. My teriyaki chicken was called the rice was weird the Ramen was good, but the udon was not."}
{"text":"Needed a last minute sushi restaurant with an AYCE and short wait. This had four stars so we took a chance.  There was no wait. We were the only ones there. We were seated and served by a very reserved, soft spoken, seemingly very shy boy who didn't know anything about the menu or its items.  All sushi places we've been to (many) minimize the portion sizes when doing AYCE sushi versus ordering ala carte, so we (wrongfully) assumed this was the case. I ordered a fried jalapeño, which is usually 2 jalapeños/ 4 halves at most. They gave me 10 halves. A full sized appetizer. Since we like ordering large amounts at one time, it was too late once we realized they don't hold back on portions.  ALL of the tempura (shrimp, calamari) comes with tempura vegetables whether you like it or not. The shrimp tempura was fine but the coating seemed damp? I didn't personally have the calamari but my friend hated it. It was overcooked and very rubbery.  The rolls are huge and don't come in half sizes. We were told they'd be 8 pieces but I think I counted at least 12.  Key note is that the rice is purple. They apparently use black rice and white rice and the result is that it dyes all of it purple. While it is very off putting at first, we couldn't taste a difference.  Dumb Notes: I hated their chopsticks. Seemed very cheap as they had splinters, and I couldn't grip them well enough to eat with. They provide a thing with ginger on one side and wasabi on the other but nothing for soy sauce. I know most people mix their soy sauce with wasabi, but I am not that kind of person. When we asked for Coke, he said okay and gave us Pepsi.  Would we go here again? Probably not."}
{"text":"This place is the best!!! We haven't had a good sushi place across from Unlv in a long time and this place is amazing   The sushi for all you can is eat, The quality of the food is great  And the servers are all so nice, the owner I think brought us ice cold napkins since she saw us dying from the heat outside   DEF TRY THIS PLACE IT IS THE BEST"}
{"text":"I actually think I kinda like this place... minus the ramen. Their AYCE sushi is $23.99. I'll probably pass on that. But as far as sushi meals for cheap this is a great place to snag something quick. They have a specials menu that I suggest buying from. There's an $8, $10, and $12 option. All of which come with miso soup and salad. They actually have a salad bar so you can choose what type of lettuce and dressing your like. It's also got different sides like cucumber and shredded cabbage. (I love the cucumber with vinegar!!!!!) My meal was $10 for some yellowtail sushi, ramen (spicy but no flavor, but the egg was bomb), and ayce salad and cucumber. I liked it for the price. Wouldn't come here unless I was in the area and actually craving some quick Asian food."}
