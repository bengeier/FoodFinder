{"text":"My family and I stopped at this place (first time) for dinner before going shopping at the outlets nearby. We were so excited to see that they have an AWESOME patio!! It's large and mostly shaded (in the evening at least). Service was excellent, food was excellent. Margaritas were excellent. $7.50 for a very large, very excellently-made Margarita (and actually I think they were on special and cheaper when we got them!!). Kid's menu was even good and my non-Mexican food eating son really enjoyed his hamburger. Great queso too btw. Honestly, we live about 45 mins from here and I would consider driving here any night-- that's how much we enjoyed our dinner."}
{"text":"Every time I visit the food is great and the service is friendly! The food comes out crispy when needed and delicious and hot. And the servers smile everytime I am there.  I get turned off when servers don't smile.... I hope that makes sense."}
{"text":"We had the fajitas. A bit more expensive than most places, but worth it.  Not only generous portion,  but really good.   The only negative we had was they do not cut the food enough. Meat not sliced through so you end up with big piece that should have been 3. Lettuce not cut enough either. Big wedges almost that don't fit a fajita. Onions too."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever.  Awful margaritas, service was so slow and our food orders were so messed up.  Complete nightmare.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"One star is way too much for this disgusting restaurant. I visited El Camino based on the yelp reviews while visiting the area and I was obviously bamboozled. The service was horrendous (waited 10 minutes for the waiter to come after being seated and only saw him one more time when he dropped off my meal.  Tried the queso and it was disgusting. Watery, flavorless and gross.  Tried the enchilada sampler and it was also disgusting. Only made it thru the second bite before asking to speak to a manager.  The beans were the most awful I've ever had.  To top it all off, the whole establishment was filthy, musty and smelled like feet.  I do want to commend the manager I spoke to with my complaints. He was quick to offer an apology and only charged me for my iced tea and the queso."}
{"text":"How do you say \"sterilize EVERYTHING and I'll be back tomorrow\" in Espanol?  Food was bland and boring, everything I touched was sticky or wet. Parking lot was apparently designed while on peyote. I lived in Tijuana in 1984, this place is very legit. No strippers in sight so I'm takin my appetite and pesos elsewhere amigo. I didn't know I was germaphobic until I realized I was rubbing Purel all the way up to my elbows."}
{"text":"We love El Camino!  We come about 3 times a month! The service is fast and friendly and the food is always great! We also love their outside patio when the weather is nice! I always get their steak fajita super burrito, it's my fave!"}
{"text":"We stopped for a late lunch here before going to the aurora outlet mall on a Sunday. It was our first time and certainly won't be our last! The food was so fresh and delicious, the lunch portion was really dinner like. Service was prompt and warm. The restaurant is clean and has a lovely Mexican flare. We are a little drive away from the mall, but we know that when we come shopping, this will be one of our must stops! Twow thumbs up for El Camino!"}
{"text":"First things first, the decoration in this restaurant is wonderful. Very open, very honeys. The most beautiful Mexican restaurant I've been to hands down.  Chips and salsa were nice, nothing special. Friend ordered the chicken burrito lunch combo, massive plate of food, cooked to perfection and delightful in her own words. My order was the spinach burrito, with guacamole salad substituted for the rice. Spinach was seasoned well, and the chile con queso on top was incredible. Guacamole was just a bit bland, but still good. Refried beans were wonderful.  Service was incredibly fast, and immensely friendly. I will be returning here, and hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Average Mexican food. Salsa was soupy. Chips seemed like there store bought. My wife thought her shrimp tacos were very good. My skillet ranchero was poor. Was supposed to be an 8 oz ribeye but was thin and tough. Margaritas were excellent."}
{"text":"It's hard to miss El Camino, sitting in bright orange splendor at the corner of Route 43 and Bissell Road.    If you've been to one Mexican place in Ohio, you've probably been to them all, but here are the bullet points about El Camino, in no particular order:  * Clean * $1.99 margaritas at lunch * fresh chicken used in entrees * salsa at first seems like tomato sauce plus, then grows on you with its bite  Need more convincing to skip over after a visit to the Aurora Farms Outlets?  Didn't think so."}
{"text":"Best Mexican around, period!  We love this place and when we  get the urge for Mexican Food, this is our go to spot.  Fish Tacos are awesome , and fried Ice Cream is to die for .  Have tried several combo plates as well, can't go wrong with El Camino!"}
{"text":"Outstanding frozen margarita.  Chips and salsa excellent.  The burrito grande is excellent and satisfying.  Someone else ordered a burritio the size of a house.  I want that the next time.  I usually reserve going to a Mexican restaurant when I want either a delicious Margarita or when I'm very hungry.  This place serves that need well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried El Camino because of a $7 off coupon we recieved in the mail. The atmosphere is fun and cozy and the food is delicious. We split an order of queso and each ordered the quesadilla fajita. We were extremely satisified and certainly didn't go home hungry!!"}
{"text":"Yay, good Mexican close to home! We tried El Camino the other night for the first time since moving to Aurora. We got take out as we had a sleeping baby upstairs. We loved it! My husband is super picky about his carnitas and thought it was really good. My chimichangas had big chunks of shredded beef and chicken in them. So yummy. Great guac. Can't speak to the margs, but I'm sure we'll be hitting them up this summer to try those!  EDITED 8/1/16: We used to really enjoy this restaurant. However, we usually get takeout due to having an active toddler, and this restaurant is atrocious for takeout service. I just got done waiting, for about the fourth time in a row, for over an hour for a take-out order that they told me to pick up in 15 to 20 minutes. I got several apologies from the young girl hostessing, but enough is enough. It seems that they put their takeout orders on the back burner so that they can serve their dining room much more efficiently. There is no reason for what we order that it should take an hour. We won't be ordering from them anymore."}
{"text":"I like it.  I've been there several times and have had a few different items.  It's not authentic.  It's MexAmerican- in particular, MexOhiocan.  But that's ok.  I like Americanized Mexican food too.  I go to Taco Bell a couple of times per month. Me gusta los nachos.  I got chili rojo, cost about $13.  I had enough food for lunch and dinner. Their table salsa is way too mild- I've had spicier breakfast cereal.  But they keep hotter sauce in the back.  Just flag down your waiter and say, \"Senior! Esto no es caliente. Por favor graba mi trasero.\" I'd love to see some authentic dishes on the menu there.  They do have some traditional items by name but they're not prepared properly- they taste pretty good though.  For example: I had their carnitas once. I didn't watch them make it, but it just tasted like seasoned, boiled pork butt to me.  Pork butt is right but it should be marinated in citrus and seasonings, then fried in manteca using a copper kettle or a large Dutch oven. I also noticed several of their beef dishes used steak cuts that wouldn't typically be used in Mexican cooking.  First, you wouldn't find whole steaks- they'd be chopped or diced. And second, they wouldn't use a rib eye, they'd use skirt steak, flank steak, milanessa.  And for those of you that think cheese smothered burritos are authentic Mexican- you will not find cheese smothered burritos in Mexico.  You probably won't even find a burrito outside of your hotel resort."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food.  Charro beans are delicious and a nice change from refried beans.  Love the fajita burrito.  Prices are reasonable and great margaritas.  Service is always friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I am definetly a fan of this place! The food is amazing and tastes authentic. The servers were nice and I went during lunch and dinner and the place was not that busy. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Four stars because of FAST service and good food. Basic, but a nice atmosphere and great frozen margaritas"}
{"text":"At this time their website isn't great, but they do have a Facebook page.   What has Aurora been missing?  Solid tasty Mexican food.  I don't mind driving for good food, but now that this place is in my own backyard...I'm a fan.    Located where Vito's used to be, it is the bright orange building.  It's a very busy place, and with the small parking lot it makes is inconvenient to get in.  But once in, it's worth it.  The prices are reasonable, the food is tasty and the portions are enough for you take take home.    Now I can't fault people for their lack of knowledge of Mexican food, but on numerous occasions I've sat near people who needed a detailed explanation of the food.  This in turn causes slightly slower service than usual."}
{"text":"This place is a must for Happy Hour.  They also have specials every day of the week.  Mondays are half price tacos -- a great deal for broke people and taco connoisseurs alike.  The service is reliable and friendly and the food is amazingly consistent.  But it's the margaritas that are really the best.  I keep coming back to this place, not because of it being close to work, but because of the multitude of highlights this place never ceases to deliver.  That said, if you're downtown and are looking for a change of pace, check out Camino.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Place looked filthy and the bathrooms were.  Had the Enchilada Monterrey with chicken.. 4 hours later I was throwing up.  Went there because of the high ratings on Yelp and was tremendously disappointed.  Either I had the wrong place or people who eat here regularly don't know what a good Mexican restaurant is... or cleanliness for that matter."}
{"text":"I found this place while visiting the area and looking for a decent margarita.  I came here a few nights, and every time I went, I opted for frozen margaritas, El Cantina has a pretty good selection of flavors, and they were delicious!  I had the mango, the strawberry banana, the azul (blue curacao), and the \"Coronarita\" (basically a traditionally flavored margarita with a bottle of Corona sitting upside down in it, slowly leaking in.) Every one of the margaritas I had were delicious, very strong, and a nice smooth texture.  The food was your basic run of the mill Mexican fare, nothing too amazing, but definitely tasty, service was friendly and fast, will be coming back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Need some lunch with a kick and slap in the culinary belly? Try the Fajitas steak lunch combo or the Nachos el Camino! The service is fast and friendly and the music is genuine, but not overbearing.  El Camino is by far the best Mexican in NE Ohio - that I've discovered as of yet!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. I got the chille verde e rojo with stewed pork that was wonderfully seasoned, with a good spice level.  My husband had a chimichanga and tamale with seasoned rice that he loved as well. This has been our second time here, and the service has been excellent both times. In fact, I was pouring on the hot sauce and the waiter walked over and handed me their house-made hot sauce which was tasty.  They gave me extra chips (even though I'm sure they knew I'd have to take it home since I had eaten way too many as an appetizer at that point :) I had their fajitas before here as well, which smells and tastes amazing.  The table next to us got it and I would have been jealous if I hadn't been so full.  Sorry for the lack of photos; I was starving and couldn't wait... Great (LARGE) portion sizes that just means an extra meal tomorrow :) The Mexican music is quite uplifting as well."}
{"text":"pretty cool little place. From the leather-bound 10lb menu's to the wonderful service to the authentic food. Our pitchers of frozen margaritas had enough alcohol to be just settling on top of the slushy goodness. Very exceptional for a location in Ohio. Love going here and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Food good, service great but guys, please for the love of god make a better margarita. It's your signature drink and it's terrible. Way to sour and pre made mix. I'd go there more if you just started to make margaritas better and used better fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Amazing  place !! Great food and great service !! Roberto made sure we had a great time !! Wines were excellent recommend Shiraz for red wine lovers !! Fajathitas were awesome both 42 & 46 on the menu are highly recommended !!  Thx  DR MD"}
{"text":"I really like this Mexican restaurant. The food is great and the staff are very friendly. The prices are reasonable and they have some of the best chicken chimichangas. I would definitely recommend anyone in the area to try this place, it is lively and I always enjoy my meal."}
{"text":"You can tell this is a local favorite. There were \"regulars\" mixed among first timers. The service staff were all really polite and attentive, which is hard to come by at most Mexican restaurants. I LOVED the salsa and chips. My favorite thus far!  Carnitas- big plate, generous serving of pork. It really could use more of a guacamole salad instead of the too oniony pico.  My husband and MIL both LOVED their plates with no complaints. I would say we were very satisfied with the meal and would go again if we are ever in the area."}
{"text":"Greatfood. The pitcher was well worth it,the skinny was delicious. The food was hot and very authentic. This is will be our fab when well ish at the outlet mall."}
{"text":"The servers are on and off  with being friendly which is the only thing negative I have to say-it's just hit or miss I suppose and it doesn't turn us off from coming.  The food is really good and generous portions for the price.  The prices are very reasonable and the chips and salsa are good.  Very authentic Mexican feel. We don't live that close but when we are in the area we always stop here.  Usually when we go to the Aurora Outlets.  Definitely a thumbs-up from us!  In the summertime they have an outside patio which is nice."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican place in the area.  The food is always very fresh and tasty.  The service is wonderful and the prices are reasonable.  We will continue to be customers.  My only complaint is that on one occasion my wife and I were in the Bar area and there was an infant in there that was very fussy and making a ton of noise.  We have kids at home and was just wanting a break.  It also looked like the child was either a close friend's child of the restaurant staff or one of the staff's kids because everyone was stopping to say hello, do baby talk, peek-a-boo's and etc...  Point is- Love kids and understand fussing children.  Just put them to bed before 10 pm and keep them out of the damn bar."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican considering the dearth of decent restaurants in this area.  Ordered the shrimp taco special (3) served with rice and refried beans. The tacos were excellent with a generous amount of garlic shrimp. The spicy pineapple sauce accompanying it was very good and added just enough heat to the sweet shrimp. Also ordered a pork tamale and and was happy to have it served lightly sauced and not smothered in cheese like many places prepare.  Service was very good and I recommend dining here if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Good menu, lots of option.  Bit more expensive than other local mexican,  but not really any better.   Good lunch specials."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, fast, convenient, El Camino serves the typical Mexican food menu that we've all come to expect in the US. Nothing unique or innovative going on here, which makes it accessible and affordable for most people. The location is convenient for residents of Solon, Twinsburg, Streetsboro, and Bainbridge. I wouldn't recommend traveling over 20 minutes to dine here because you probably have a similar place closer to you. But, if you're in the area (at the outlets maybe), stop in, you'll be happy."}
{"text":"Another meal and yet another visit to El Camino which has began to mean El Delicious, well to me at least. My stomach was growling so loudly as I entered the door, that people probably thought I brought a dog along.  I ordered a new favorite: grilled chicken with poblano sauce. A few bites later, I was once again in Mexican heaven (which I imagine to be sitting on a white sanded beach surrounded by 77 piña coladas). I have a feeling I'll be back..."}
{"text":"During the holidays Mexican really hits the spot.   Fresh chips and salsa greated us before our seats were warm. To complement the salsa we added some quesso. I decided to get the El Camino which is a sampler of everything they have to offer. The plates came out fast and the were too hot to handle.  The beef taco was nice. The bean tostata was good. The pork tamales were amazing. The beef enchiladas were great.  The poblano pepper was exceptional."}
{"text":"I ate here on an internet coupon, because otherwise it is quite far for me to go. But I've been back a couple times -- in fact, whenever I am in the general area -- because of one amazing item on the menu....the Tortilla soup.   It is completely amazing. It is worth a drive out here just to have it. It's unlike any similar tortilla soup I have ever had. Delicious broth. LOADS of fresh tender chicken and tortillas. But the topper is you get a big plate of pica gallo, rice and a lime to squeeze into the soup. This takes from simply \"delicious chicken soup\" into the stratosphere.  Other food items were good to above average. It is a typical Mexican place, located in an old tudor home painted NEON orange so you can't miss it! Affordable prices. I had tacos (chicken and beef) which were very good; the chicken (as in the soup) is fresh and homemade, not the prepackaged strips one often gets today. My husband had a taco salad that was very good, and the tortilla \"bowl\" had literally been fried to order -- good enough he ate every bit of it. We did not get a chance to try desert, maybe next time.  But honest to god, come for the soup. Even if you get nothing else. It's almost a meal in itself anyways. AAA+++"}
{"text":"We had the Saturday margarita special, the margaritas weren't as good as I expected, compared to other Mexican places we frequent. But the food was pretty good and came out really fast."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced decent Mexican fare.....they are quick to bring you your food but then tend to forget about you...takes a long time to get the check"}
{"text":"Food bland service horrid. Waiter messed up the order and then never checked on us again. Being from Texas this \"Mexican\" food was not good."}
{"text":"We go here frequently. They have the best Mexican food in is area by farmers! Oh and they drinks are excellent! They are always friendly. I love the salsa. It always taste so fresh. We never have to wait long if at all and everyone is always smiling. The service is fast and we never leave feeling like we will red a snack later. Most often, the owner is there and he pretty much knows us by now.  if you are ever in the area or just want some delicious Mexican food, this is he place to go hands down! Get the Mango Margarita!"}
{"text":"I don't do a lot of review updates, but after recent experiences here, I felt the need to do so.  This place is getting better.  Service has improved greatly.  The menu is still large and features a large number of seafood entrees.  The margaritas are amazing.  The Texano margaritas are strong and flavorful.  They are just the right thing to drink at the end of a long week.  The Queso Fundido appetizer is special.  Their fajitas are among the best that I have every ordered.  Nice variety, well seasoned, large portions.  They have a large amount of classic Tex Mex items on the menu, and most are very good.  Their patio is great on a warm, sunny day.  It is a great place for small or large groups.  The only knock has nothing to do with the restaurant staff.  Be prepared, especially if you eat indoors, to deal with families with small children.  I have experienced it myself on several occasions, usually early in the day.  Overall, this place has elevated itself to being my favorite Mexican restaurant in northeast Ohio."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food and seems to be very authentic with the menu. Nice little patio you can sit outside on a nice day or night. Only been here once with my 10 year son and he liked it too. Service was good. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not really much to say.  Came here on a Sunday evening after a day at Wildwater Kingdom.  the service was quick and prompt, however the food was a bit of a letdown.  Big menu, a little overpriced and low quality food.  I wouldnt say anything really struck me as great.  Nice patio"}
{"text":"We like the food here, service is always friendly and pretty quick. I think it's a decent value.   Not more to say, typical Mexican style restaurant."}
{"text":"Great margaritas, and at $1.99 for lunch, you can't go wrong!  We've never had a bad meal here yet, and the servers are always very friendly which compliments the quick delivery of your meal nicely!  Try the fajitas!  Every one of the fajita dishes is awesome and you're guaranteed to have to take some home!"}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, delicious, and exactly the type of comfort food I need every now and then. I usually come during lunch, so it's never very crowded and the chips always hot and fresh out of the chip maker. The lunch portions are so huge that I can't imagine what the dinner portions are like!  Word of warning: if you come for lunch and need to be functional at work that afternoon, don't get a margarita. You won't be sober after you finish it!"}
{"text":"Was kind of let down was excited to try based off the Yelp reviews. The service was fast and friendly but the salsa and guac had virtually no flavor our fajitas were just ok. Nothing extraordinary. Don't know if I'd completely rule this place out, but I doubt if I'd go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"I was with a friend on a day trip to Ohio when we decided that we couldn't wait to get back to Pittsburgh to eat. This restaurant seemed like it was in the middle of nowhere but I saw that it had good rating so I decided to take a gamble.  The staff was really nice and pleasant. Our waiter was really helpful and also pretty funny which is always appreciated. I ordered chimichangas because i needed them to survived and devoured every bike. The dish came with two, small chimis with one chicken, one beef with your standard side of rice. The chicken chimichanga was tasty but the beef was even better! While I doubt I'll be back in Aurora anytime soon, I would totally go there again when it is warmer and the patio was open!"}
{"text":"First restaurant I went to when I moved here good was average Mexican fair, large portions, well cooked, margaritas were strong, service ok. A good value B+ overall."}
{"text":"They have the best Mexican food! They have a friendly staff and fast service .. The food is delicious. We always get the bean dip. It's the best we've ever had .. Everything we have tried on the menu we have been very pleased with!"}
{"text":"A splendid backwoods cantina serving up sizzling, decadent veggie fajitas, and currently outfitted with a staggering array of Halloween decorations, El Camino is a marvelous stopover for any spice-seeker on a journey through the Aurora countryside. The service is swift and the complementary chips are just salty enough to satisfy without sending partons scuttling for their water pitchers. The salsa, a sweet hot blend, is ideal mixed with a glob of the queso, which is, at $5 itself, an unholy delight, best consumed before it cools completely. At least one guest was seen eating it by the spoonful. The tortillas, unlike their cheesy counterpart, are lackluster, however...managing to be both oddly brittle and moist at the same time. The prudent diner would do well to simply sift her fajita fixings into a salad formation and forgo them altogether. The fajitas, of the zucchini and onion variety, are spicy but not overwhelming. Try a margarita too, at the bar in the back. They are rather utilitarian, but sometimes this is a blue collar blessing. Simple, easy, tart, and strong. Something Malcolm Lowery's Consul might have ordered as a midday pick-me-up. In sum, it's difficult to miss this vivid Mexican beacon burgeoned up from the unassuming countryside. Wander in among the cobwebs, Frankensteins, and shimmering ghouls this season. Help yourself to zippy salsa and margs. Avoid the tortillas. You'll be a happy camper."}
{"text":"I ordered the #18 Lunch special, the Burrito de Fajitas, a soft tortilla stuffed with steak fajitas and then topped with chile con queso. Served with Mexican rice and charro beans. Also had some of their Mexican soup and the standard tortilla chips and salsa. It was all delicious. The Dr. Pepper tasted perfect. The server was great. I would love to return and order the Burrito de Fajitas covered in chile con queso again. Excellent."}
{"text":"Best place for Mexican food in the area. This is our goto place when we have a hankering for fajitas and chips & salsa. They are very fast and prompt with their service . This is the kids favorite place to eat. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and Mexican food.  The staff and managment are very friendly. Highly recommended. A+++++"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Enchiladas and chips were fresh and tasty.  The rice was not salty and the food arrived at the speed of light, with friendly service that was prompt.  One of the best Mexican places I've been to."}
{"text":"Mango margarita was not very good.  Burritos were ok.  Salsa looked good, but was a \"taste\" disappointment.  I'm from out-of-town, but wouldn't go back if I lived here.   Surely there's better Mexican food in Cleveland"}
{"text":"I was looking for some good Mexican food when the name of this restaurant popped up on my screen. They have a very cozy and comfortable ambiance and the staff is friendly. The food was delicious and we ended up overstuffing our tummies. Definitely worth a visit.."}
{"text":"For a part of town almost void of Mexican food this new addition is a welcome neighbor. Associated with Si Senor it has similar menu, food and service.  The service is quick and the servers are knowledge. Friendly and helpful the language barrier is not an issue. Food may have been sitting under a warming lamp or the sauce pre-made, as the nachos were a bit soggy. Nicely located on a corner with easy accessibility. Decor was beautiful, resembles true  mexican decor. Very clean. Bathrooms showed the age of the building, not the fault of the current restaurant. Would recommend to any resident of the area looking for good food and a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Good food, fast service. The drinks are huge with just the right amount of alcohol. Servers are friendly and knowledgeable"}
{"text":"Tonight we were going to do bbq & chose Mexican instead. I am So glad we did!!! Started with the Seafood Nachos- delicious & crispy. I had the Patron Fajitas- a mix of chicken, steak, chorizo & carnitas. Moist & delicious with a nice crispness to the peppers & onions. Shrimp enchiladas had a great tasting sauce & had a nice authentic taste. My husband is very picky about his Mexican food & was highly impressed. I Will Definitely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Decent mexican food for Ohio! i had a fish salad and it was pretty good! I feel like things are a tad overpriced..but not bad. The chips and salsa are delicious and overall I would eat here again! Plus workers are super nice and it is just fun."}
{"text":"I've been to El Camino quite a few times for happy hour and once for dinner. I would stick to happy hour. The prices are great, the margaritas are great, and the chips and salsa is great. It's a fun place for a girl's night out or a low key fun date night. The food is pretty good. I've had beef enchiladas and the cheese dip appetizer (which I wouldn't get again).   The place is always packed around dinner time with a loud fun atmosphere. One thing that sucks though is the service. It's always slow and occasionally the servers are rude. I once sat at the bar for probably 10-15 minutes with no one even coming up to me."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town! The happy hour is amazing, with many drinks to choose from and it's pretty much all day from open until 6pm every week day. The food tasted great and the staff were friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. I ordered the lunch fajitas. They arrived on the plate with the rice, beans and condiments. Half the reason I order fajitas is to enjoy the smell of them as they are served steaming on the hot cast iron skillet. The onions and peppers were undercooked, the tomatoes were rather large to fit in a tortilla and the chicken was dry. To top things off, after I was served, I was completely ignored. Not once did my waiter come ask me how everything was. He was too busy sitting at the bar watching Tru TV laughing out loud as idiots hurt themselves doing stupid tricks. I had to interrupt him to get my check. Not planning on ever going back."}
{"text":"Do you want great Mexican food? Go to El Camino.  It's that simple.  I like anything that looks, smells, or sounds Mexican.  You really can get a varied experience from fast food to tex-mex to authentic.  Well, El Camino really does everything well in the authentic realm.  Margaritas are typically good, and sometimes expensive.  The menu has everything you'd expect out of a Mexican joint, with good prices and fast service.  Chips and salsa? Included.  Taco meat isn't overly oily (thank god) and carnitas is done right.  The staff is always incredibly friendly and accommodating.  In fact, we went on Mother's Day one year and even got a free meal!  Wasn't even advertised but they really appreciate their customers."}
{"text":"This place was right by the hotel I am staying. It is off the chain!!!  Truly authentic Mexican food! Yummy sauce, quesadilla was so good!!  I'm in impressed. Please stop by and have a margarita on the rocks. They carry a punch and super yummy."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food, especially for this area. Great service too."}
{"text":"Very tasty Mexican food! Endless chips and salsa. Crazy awesome margaritas and even crazier are the sangaritas. If you dont like colors, good food, or Spanish culture don't go to this restaurant. If you are normal and do like these things you will have a great time."}
{"text":"Always are go-to when heading to or from the Aurora outlets. Great food, waiters are super friendly, good parking, and good prices. Would drive here rather than nearby Abuelos.   Ordered fajitas and enchiladas - so tasty. Spice level was great! Fresh and hot!"}
{"text":"Just thinking about this place's queso makes me hungry.  I just moved here from California and was afraid I'd miss legit Mexican food, this place makes up for it.  The white queso and chips and margaritas are awesome, plus every dish they have is just good quality food.  I love their enchiladas and my boyfriend loves their Popeyes pollo, but everything we have tried so far has been delicious.    We come here at least once a week and they always take care great of us, the wait staff is super genuine and attentive!    Excited to take my mom here when she visits this summer, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"It's funny... El Camino is just a couple of letters shy of one of my favorite Mexican places to eat... El CamPESino.  The PES is one of the few things different about the two, if you ask me.  They really do remind me of each other greatly - however those little differences there is what separates me from giving them a 4, instead of a 5, like El Camp.  The chips and salsa are a delight - both times they were piping hot and perfectly fresh - the salsa is not very spicy but a nice well rounded flavor and not too chunky.  The queso is fantastic!  Its a queso blanco, not too thick but not super runny... it has a consistency you will not want to pass up.  It's smooth and creamy and if you dip a little into the salsa and then into the cheese... it's a wonderful blend.  This queso very much reminds me of the dip at El Camp.  The cheese that does not, however, is the shredded for tacos, let's say.  El Camp has the better cheese when it comes to that, hands down.  It's fluffier there and smooth and silky and so so good.  This white cheese shred was not horrible by any means, but it wasn't my favorite.  I had a chicken and shredded beef chimichange (one of each) with rice, beans and a ranchero sauce, guac and sour cream.  I would definitely recommend it as a very filling dish, and topped with all the good stuff without paying extra for it.  Great flavor, super fresh, meats well shredded and easy to chew, and superb texture of the chimichanga exterior - not too crispy but not soggy either, which I sometimes find is a hard perfect balance for restaurants to reach.  El Camino nailed it.  Like I said, VERY similar to El Camp, if you're familiar with that restaurant.  Lunch specials are a DEAL!  Beers are about $3.50 for a nice Mexican variety.  There's live music on Wednesdays, and food specials on their board just about every day.  I'd definitely give this little casa styled restaurant, on the corner of North Bissell and S.R. 43, a try!"}

I guess people don't know better here in Ohio. If you want the runs go ahead and eat this garbage. Sorry, but how can the place be run by a Hispanic staff and get away with that food.. Come on now."}
