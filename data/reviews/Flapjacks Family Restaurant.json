{"text":"We looked this place up and although it was out of the way we were both glad we drove the extra distance.  

My girlfriend had the much acclaimed banana bread French toast which was original and deserving of a 4 star rating. I had the open face roast beef sandwich which was also good. 

This place will not wow you with flavours but it's comfort food that will not let you down. The staff was friendly, and welcoming - no complaints.

It was on the show \"You Gotta Eat Here\", and even though the host has average taste - he was on par this time.

Grab a side of peameal bacon it's different than the average place and really really good."}

It's a breakfast place, with an emphasis on the pancakes.  I was kinda hoping to stop here on the way back from the cottage as well, but the timing didn't work."}

{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to have breakfast. The fiancé and I have had to give ourselves a limit of 1 visit per month because we would honestly go every weekend. First of all, the staff is just great! They remember your face, and with us they even know what drinks we like to be served when we arrive. It really has that small town feel of a breakfast place. Love it! Second, the food is delicious, and the portions are great! They have gluten free pancakes and they can be made apple, raspberry, blueberry, strawberry, banana or chocolate chip. I personally like to get banana chocolate chip. My fiancé always gets the steak and eggs and its always a good cut of meat, cooked well and served piping hot. The toast is fresh baked bread, the orange juice is freshly squeezed and the jams are also homemade. Basically you can't go wrong! The prices are slightly cheaper than Cora's and well worth the drive out into caledon!"}
