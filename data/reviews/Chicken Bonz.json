{"text":"Had to give this place a try, wont ever go back! They have a list of flavor sauces which is WHACK and their 2 hottest sauces DAMN HOT & DAMN MISTAKE is WEAKSAUCE!!! Better off going to Buffalo Wild Wings!"}
{"text":"First time here and I loved this place. We got a wings combo and a boneless wings combo ($7.99 each). The boneless wings were actually more like chicken tenders, but they were meaty and delicious. White meat chicken, fresh, and the batter was good. The hot sauce was similar to a franks sauce - definitely hit the spot.  The regular wings (Bonz) were a good size and tasted fresh. I thought it was just as good as Buffalo Wild Wings if not better. Nice and crisp on the outside. However the honey bbq sauce is better at BWW's. Still good though.  The fries were cut super thin which I liked. They were well seasoned and crispy. I'll definitely be back to try their other sauces and sides.  The restaurant is quite small on the inside, but it has some cool decor and a fun, casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Cashier was friendly but all I wanted was the salad bar with grilled chicken, the cook was mad we wanted grilled chicken and gave a loud UGH sound when we asked for it and then he yells from the back are you sure you want \"grilled\"? We said yes we don't eat fried and he says well then its going to take twice as long and we said that's fine, but then he just gave attitude and turned around. Definitely didn't stick around to see what he was going to do to our food!! Will NEVER return!!"}
{"text":"Good food.. Went on a Sunday for the game and was nice wasn't that busy which was good cause I could hear the game. My man ate over 35 wigs they have an all you can eat 12.95 well worth it"}
{"text":"The wings were pretty good and they are the full size. But they were all out of the $1 beer they advertise. If you get the unlimited wings, it takes about 10-15min to get the next order so preorder. The service was questionable. I had to ask permission if we can eat there after the girl rolled her eyes at us when I asked her a question."}
{"text":"Ya gotta love Chicken Bonz.  Now I say this because for the first time in a long time a place has provided me with a great wing experience.... Not just once but on several occasions.  Chicken Bonz has some of the best wings I've had in a while and they are crispy, large wings that don't disappoint.  When you walk in there is a huge menu board that you order from at the front counter.  The girl I ordered from was very nice and energetic (I wish I remembered her name, sorry).  And she also served us or food.  The ambiance of the place is laid back and almost feels like a college bar esk type of place.  We got the wings and they were at a good temp, large and crispy (just the way I like them).  Oh and the sweet potatoe tots are AWESOME!!!!! They make a mean sweet tea and the TV's were on ESPN.  So all in all it was a great experience...    So if you have one by you or your craving some seriously good wings look the place up!"}
{"text":"Meh ... I really have had better. I will say the service was good and when you order a combo plate, they will give you a \"kids\" portion if you need it for free.  My husband and I ordered the boneless wings and I never thought I would say this, but I would rather go to BWW. The boneless wings at Chicken Bonz where too large (more of a strip than wing), the chicken was chewy and the breading/batter didn't stay on the wing.  If I ever venture back, it will be for the bone-in wings and I do not eat bone-in wings. :-)"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times.  The food is always fresh and the cashier/ food runner is really, really nice and hardworking.  I have been a few times when my fries were served cold...but they are always quick to remake them.  I give them 4 stars out of 5 because of the video game machines that kids tend to go crazy on (making a very loud disturbance for other customers)."}
{"text":"The lemon pepper fingers are delicious! I recommend asking for extra lemon pepper seasoning because its that good!"}
{"text":"If you love fried chicken & chicken wings, you'll enjoy this place! I decided to check this place out when I had a craving for some chicken wings and honestly BWW just doesn't do it for me. Ironically, this location was across the street from BWW so thought eh what the heck, I'll try it.   Once we arrived it was dead! However, that didn't discourage me from trying this place. Looking at the menu, the AYCE is the best deal. At first, I was a little confused on how the process worked since the hostess/cashier/waitress really didn't explain it. But in the end I was ok with it. After an hour, then service picked up.  So enough with the fluff, let's get down to business. These little suckers are huge! Seriously the first basket with 10 pieces will get you full. Make sure to split the order with 2 flavors so you can sample at least 2 different sauces. After the first basket, each basket comes with 5. And nothing says awesome like $1 PBR to wash down the wings. For a minute there, I felt like I was a competitive eater as I raced to beat the 12-yr old kid that kept eating wings. Unfortunately I paid for it after 30 some wings.  We seriously tried every flavor - sesame soy started off good but by the 3 wing, I need something to drink. It became salty and the sauce was thick. The Garlic Parm wasn't bad but honestly just tasted like fried chicken. I love sweet chili but they didn't put enough sauce on these suckers. Remember folks, if chicken is battered and deep fried, more sauce is needed than usual especially when the sauce is thin. The hot sauces were pretty similiar to Hooters. Overall, if you're a fan of Hooters, you'll enjoy this place. It's quieter, $1 beers and big screens to keep you entertained. Plus as Stephanie mentioned freshly brewed tea!"}
{"text":"This is a long overdue review for the place we call Bonz! I have made my way here about 5 times now and just keep wanting to come back. Every time I step foot in here I leave full and happy!  How can you go wrong with all you can eat chicken wings and frys. They typically keep them coming fast unless its a busy night. They seem to always be understaffed but never lack on the quality of there food and service with a smile. I have had the opportunity to have a different server every time I have gone and each one of them have been helpful, thoughtful, fast, and caring with a smile on there face ready to bring us more and more.   They have a good variety of wings to choose from. So far I think the best is there Sweet Chilli and oriental, Those are my top 2 and you can never go wrong with the spicy BBQ and yes every time I go there my last basket is the Damn Mistake. No joke that's what the flavor is called and yes every time its a damn mistake that I order them because they can really kick your ..... anyway,   The family style restaurant has a great theme and comfortable environment to have a beer and eat some wings."}
{"text":"If want fresh chicken wings and fingers this is the place to go.!!   They put raising canes to shame. By far the best chicken place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I think this might be one of the better wing places in the valley honestly.  The wings here are large and in charge, and I like that they don't over-batter them.  They always seem to come out crispy, and not drowned in sauce, which is a plus for me.  I don't care that they don't have like 20 flavors like BWs, because their sauces are tasty and they run the spice gamut.  Service is friendly, and fast, and I like that they have rolls of paper towels on the tables, and give you wet naps to clean up when you're done eating.  Also a big fan of their boneless \"wings\", which are gigantic."}
{"text":"This place Sucks overall  I went for the 10 wing deal, got home ate about 6 then tossed the rest. I hate feeling obligated to eat something  I don't like,  considering the price I paid; this was one of those times.   Cons - wings are jumbo size and not cooked thoroughly - they charge for watered down ranch - the sauce taste like shit   Pros - service was ok  Too bad this place sucks because I like eating good wings especially if it's close to home."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best place for wings, look no further. With the friendly staff, great food, and incredible all-you-can-eat, Bonz has it all.  Football, beer, and endless wings....need I say more?"}
{"text":"All you can eat for $12.95? You can't beat that.  You walk in and you're immediately greeted by the person at the counter.  The wings are large and very fulfilling.  All you can eat might even be too much. If you don't wanna miss the big game, you can rest assured, it'll be on one of the many tvs.  The service there is outstanding.  A group of my friends and I all ordered all-you-can-eat wings, and when we inevitably couldn't finish the rest, they let us take them home. Score! I never understood why a restaurant wouldn't allow you to take home your leftovers. They're gonna be thrown away anyway! Needless to say, I will be frequenting this place for years to come."}
{"text":"I luv the wings @ chicken bonz and the services are over the top.  Taylor was great and suggested the teri-q sauce to me.  I'm a total fan now!"}
{"text":"Chicken wings are big!!! Flavors are good too. I love this place coz u can get unlimited sweet tea lol"}
{"text":"Their wings are huge which is a plus! The flavors are ok, it's kinda like Wing Stop knock off style. They do offer all you can eat wings for like $12.00. All you can eat fries are $2.00 extra. With the all you can eat wings, it starts off as a order of 10pc then goes to orders of 5 thereafter which was pointless for myself because I went thru wings like a granny on air supply."}
{"text":"I got to give this place props.  They have great wings and all you can eat, plus dollar beers.   There salad bar is great and always fresh. I love there damn mistake sauce and then if you can't handle it for a dollar you can get the antidote.  But that's for little girls  If you like a nice atmosphere great food cheap beer give this place a shot  On a side note tailor always takes great care of me and my friends.  She makes sure me beer glass is always full.  You have to love that.  She is great ask for her is you want great service at a fast food restaurant"}
{"text":"As someone from Buffalo, I had some high hopes for this place, as I am always looking to get good wings, plus I live around the corner from here so I was again hoping for the best. Now I have not been inside their yet, this review is for a catered lunch from my work by them.   Ultimately my biggest problem was with the wings, the tenders were decent and so were some of the sauces, but the wings were not like chicken wings, they were breaded a bit which from containers they were catered in, made them soft. Truthfully, I would compare this chicken wing more to KFC than to Buffalo Wild Wings. They are big like Buffalo wings, and the chicken itself was fine quality, but the breading ruined them terribly considering them as chicken wings. Not sure if my work ordered them like that but it was definitely no good.  Maybe I will walk in and try the place and see if they can up a star. $1 beers might do that :)"}
{"text":"This is the greatest place great cook!  All u can eat...  Good staff!  Me and a group of friends come every Thursday!!!  Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Great wings all the time. The all you can eat is always available and well worth it. Wings are big and juicy. Don't pass it up! Service is good. Staff is friendly.  Please please please do NOT change the name to Meat, Chix, & Weiners....Terrible name, not good for family, feels like you're trying to copy that other big-name wing place, I would not recommend friends or family to a place with that name...gonna lose a few regulars. While I was in there, every customer had a complaint about the name change. Stop it before it is too late. Don't fix something that isn't broken!"}
{"text":"First time great wings and a variety of flavors.I think when going to this place I expected too much. What you get here is simple. Wings, tenders and burgers. Gave an extra star due to the fact they had shoe string fires which always sways my reviews. The wings are larger than your average place like Wing Stop or Buffalo Wild Wings. I will be back to try the various flavors that most places don't have. Felt like the wings I made at home. That's why I gave such few stars. I like to go out and be wowed. Not this time but it is a place worth checking out. You never know you might enjoy it a lot more than I did."}
{"text":"This restaurant turned into \"Meat Chix and Weiners\" and has frankly gone straight down the tubes.  Different menu, horrible chicken, new sauces with odd flavors."}
{"text":"Fantastic sauces. Those who prefer Buffalo Wild have never had wings in New England. Meaty, tasty boned wings, huge boneless portions. Sauces are actually hot and well portioned."}
{"text":"Had a groupon for this place so the Mrs. and I ventured here after church today. I was impressed overall. Clean inside and looked new despite being around for a few years. Staff was friendly and helpful. I got a the 6 wing combo. They had no issues with getting multiple sauces which is a rarity in this day and age. My wife ordered the 2 wing with salad combo. They have a salad bar which we thought to be an original concept for a joint like this.   The food is good. I got the Garlic Parmesan wings which is a sort of dry rub. Usually not a huge fan of the dry wings but there were definitely a cut above the rest and I would gladly order again. Ordered Hot wings also which were typical. Wing sizes are large in comparison to a Buffalo Wild Wings. I'd say prices are competitive with other wings joints if not better given the size of the bird. Fries are of the shoestring variety and were excellent. Fountain drinks were easily accessible to patrons and the much-coveted Mr. Pibb was available. Punch cards are given which ensures future visits for this duo.   Overall a great place and some of the better wings in Las Vegas that I've had. Will have to do the AYCE soon."}
{"text":"SO after passing by this place several times, we decided to check it out. If you order the boneless chicken, a 10 piece should feed a family of three or even four if you order it with a large french fries. Theres really nothing special about this place. We had the garlic chili sauce with ours. They give you two little containers with every order of 10. The fries were really salty. Service was fast and sweet tea was really good. I dont think I would go there again. It didnt WOW me. =)"}
{"text":"Had never been here before. Bought a groupon, and now I am sorry I did not buy more. This place was really good.  We ordered the Chicken bonzlelezz picnic basket. The Tenders were crunchy and perfectly seasoned. They have a good selection of sauces. My favorite was the sweet barbecue. The coleslaw was crunchy and tasty. Not all mayo. The beans were a huge hit. Not too crazy about the fries. I prefer crunchy fries. The young woman at the register was nice and helpful. A real sweet person. We had so many questions. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Love Chicken Bonz when in the mood for good wings.  This place is directly across the street from another chain (BWW), and I haven't been in the other since they opened.  Simply a better product.  Good wings and $1 drafts of Blue Moon?  Good 'nuf for me!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food and cool staff, especially the cooks. Very cool guys. Ive ate there over 10 times and never had a complaint. The fries are my favorite thing. Beats mcdonalds fries hands down all day!"}
{"text":"Walked in with my boy and told the server that it was out first time.  She happily broke down the menu for us.  We decided to go with the chicken tender combo for $7.95 that included fries and a drink.  I went with the sesame soy sauce and the boy went with honey bbq.  They have a salad bar that it seemed like a lot of the other customers were enjoying.  Upon our orders arrival I was impressed by the overall size of the tenders.  They were  cooked with just the right amount of crunch and the chicken was moist and tasty.  My recommendations are if coming for lunch come early.  My other one is avoid the ranch dressing.  It is was to loose to cling to wings or tenders."}
{"text":"Came here for wings, but there's no way to get wings gluten free. I could have gotten a burger or salad but the place is named Chicken Bonz. I don't want a burger or a salad I want chicken wings.   I did try a sweet potato tater tot which was passable, but not special.   Won't be here again."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst chicken on earth!! First of all, they servin them  tuff  BIG steroid chicken wings!! The garlic Parmesan had no flavor at all!! The lemon pepper was okay, just couldn't get past how big and tuff these wings were!! It was like a turkey drum stick!!! The only thing that was really good were the shoe string French fries and salad bar...your best bet is to stick with wing stop!!!"}
{"text":"First came in it was empty server/cashier she was nice and helpful she stuck around to see our reaction to the hottest wing \"damn mistake\" not as hot as I thought but it is a lingering HOT nice that they have an antidote though lol some of the flavors are a bit dry it is worth the all you can eat but for me I wouldn't need all you can eat next time cause it's a big size chicken overall something about the flavors won't bring me back for a crave but for a social."}
{"text":"3 of us were planning to go to burger bar inside mandalay bay.  but we missed the exit as there was construction and somehow ended up on the 215....and when we got off we saw Chicken Bonz....  So instead of fighting the traffic onto the strip we decided to try it out.  Price wasn't too bad...all you can eat wings for like $13.  I had the garlic parmesan which seemed a little bland.  Then I tried the Hot Wings...and it was kind of spicy....not too bad.  The ranch was a bit watery...  As the others mentioned these are the big wing versions.....so you get a lot of meat.  I personally prefer the small crispy kind...  For the price it isn't bad....but it just didnt do it for me...."}
{"text":"Chicken wings are not cooked and still had some feathers on them.. Very gross, still recovering from food poison from this place."}
{"text":"Bad!!!   I was a loyal Chicken Bonz customer at the original location on Sunset, then they became Chicken Shack. I was excited to see this Chicken Bonz because it is much closer to my House than the original, but I was sadly disappointed, The chicken is plain and the ranch is terrible! I now drive to Chicken Shack in Henderson to get my fix. Way better food!"}
{"text":"what a disappointment, i didn't want to risk the AYCE so i decided to go with a combo meal.  6 wings, fries and a drink for 7.95 plus extra for ranch.  As soon as they charged extra for ranch i should have known.    The wings were big, but nothing special at all.  i had the parm garlic wings and it was just wings with parmesan cheese sprinkled on it. my friend had hot bbq and the sauce was nothing memorable.  i would recommend wingstop of buffalo wild wings for sure over this place."}
{"text":"Allyoucaneat wings!! Ok, now that I have your attention. I wasn't kidding about AYCE. It's about 12 bucks per person. And the wings must've came from baby turkeys, because they're unbelievably huge!! So, if you ever felt like you weren't getting enough.. Try chicken bonz.   It's kinda hidden in the industrial area of south Decatur. So keep an eye out for it. I only give it four stars because some of the wings were dry inside. At least they have those shoestring fries. But they do charge extra for more ranch -__-  Overall I await the day to take all my big guy cousins who are madly in love with anything wings."}
{"text":"My coworker and i stopped by here for lunch today, and were very dissapointed...first off i ordered the 5 piece boneless wings, which are actually just chicken fingers. I am a huge fan of garlic Parmesan sauce so, naturally i ordered them in this. But the term sauce is a overstatement. Its not really sauce at all, more like a dry seasoning just sprinkled over them, even the bone-in wings were dry...not what i expect from a \"sauce\". The chicken was as dry as the vegas heat. No flavor whatsoever. I would not recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Best wings I've had yet. I'd recommend getting with bones as they taste better than the boneless (we got both and noticed a difference). Favorites were mild with ranch, honey BBQ, and spicy honey BBQ."}
{"text":"I have to wholly recommend this place. It blows most wings you have tried in your life out of the water. The deal for endless wings is great ($12.99 all you can eat).   The wings come breaded and fried, never cold or nasty-tasting.  They are very crispy and have a great texture. There are several sauces: regular wing sauce with varying degrees of spice and a few other ones (Honey BBQ, teriyaki, sweet chili garlic, sweet and sour, etc.). The regular wing sauces come with a nice buttermilk ranch as well, not the mayo-based sauce other places might serve. The wings are very big and meaty, not very tiny. They give you bigger portions in your first round and afterwards shrink it down. Not exactly what some may like, but it is all-you-can-eat  and it is less wasteful in case you overestimated your appetite.   I have to also recommend the fries. They come very crispy and thin. These have to be among the best tasting fries I've had as well. They don't give you sauce for these fries, you have to get it over at the condiments counter but the side benefit is they also serve fry sauce and in case you want to dip it in ranch, there usually is enough left afterwards for dipping. There is a drink fountain (Coke-based) and a tea machine for those who would rather partake in that instead.   Normally, the service for this place is decent; my only complaint is that sometimes the waiters can screw up the sauce you have, but bringing it up with them usually fixes the problem. I have to commend the employees (an older brunette and a young cook with a buzz cut) that worked yesterday. Although it was very busy and understaffed, they did not lose their cool and kept the service with a smile. I hope the managers do, however, at least adequately staff the place for the busier times. It's not fair to the customers, nor is it to them, who have to bear the grunt of it."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best chicken wings. I go there a lot for lunch and order the \"Bonzless\" with honey bar-b-que sauce. I've also taken the family and the kids love 'em. And we all know how kids can  picky about food. They have a variety of sauces from mild to damn hot. And they got some great chili there too."}
{"text":"We had dinner here a couple of weeks ago after driving by this location so many times and seeing the AYCE sign for chicken wings.   I ordered the AYCE, while the wife ordered a combo plate. According to the menu, kids can eat free for each combo plate that is ordered by an adult (BOGO): should've paid more attention to the receipt since we were charged for the kid's meals.   They have draft beer for $1 plus .08 tax.   The chicken wings with bones are huge. I can normally polish off an 18 piece wing order from KFC. This ACYE meal gives you 12 wings that are really big and meaty. when you start digging down the basket, the wings to get a bit smaller and some are the size of the KFC ones, but when you can keep ordering them, who cares. I ordered the med. hot sauce for the wings to see how they rate their hotness....it wasn't really that hot, but then again I like hot and spicy food.   The other rule about the ACYE wings is you are not allowed to share them with your table mates.   Overall, we enjoyed the wings. They were juicy, and just a bit salty. Not sure if that is because they are brining their wings or its in their batter.   There's a salad bar with some type of signage that indicated no salad refills: we watched someone refill her serving container 4 times and nothing was said by staff.   We will come here again, but make sure you bring a good appetite, since I could not eat anymore and the price for a dozen wings is a dollar or two cheaper that the ACYE."}
{"text":"Being wing lovers, we have been searching for a good wing place closer to our house. So naturally, we had to check out this place. The problem, though, is that we are specifically hot wing lovers. For wings, this place gets 4-5 stars. For hot wings, it gets 3 stars.  We ordered the hot (with a side of damn hot), sweet chili garlic, and parmesan wings. And, of course, a side of fries with chili.  The parmesan wings were the best of the three. The texture is amazing! Super crispy and meaty. But alas, they are not hot wings.  The sweet chili garlic wings were pretty good. Great flavor with a subtle kick. But the sauce isn't very thick. (And we like our wings very saucy.)  The hot wings were great at first bite. The sauce is really, really good. It is actually hot - the perfect amount of spiciness and kick. But the sauce made the texture all off. The wings were almost soggy.  Major props for the damn hot sauce. Definitely very, very hot. And with a delicious flavor.  The wings themselves were quite good. Good size and meatiness, and good quality.  The ranch and blue cheese were above average, but not great. And neither went very well with the sweet chili garlic and parmesan. (And wings, for us, just must be dipped.)  The fries were excellent. Shoestring-style that were cooked just right. The chili was ok - decent, but I probably wouldn't get chili on the fries again.  The prices are very reasonable and they actually have all-you-can-eat wings, which, of course, is a great deal.  All in all, great wings, but not great hot wings. I will definitely be back again when I have a craving for non-hot wings. The texture of the parmesan wings was fantastic. Very different from other wings I have had and very enjoyable.   But, alas, I tend to always crave hot wings. And while the hot sauce was good, it destroyed the great texture and the dipping sauces weren't up to par. So the search for excellent hot wings near our house continues.   But again, really great regular wings - so we will be back for those."}
{"text":"I came here for the all you can eat wings and to watch a NBA game. The whole experience was one of the worst I've had at any restaurant in life. First off the wait in the line must have been 20 minutes just to get our order in. I felt worst for others who came in later when the line was even longer and had to wait about 35 minutes before they put in their order and sat down. Secondly, the AC was broken and the room was sweltering like a sauna. Next, there were only two workers in the whole place to serve about 30 customers...one waitress/cashier and one cook. There was confusion and the service was extremely slow.  How the all you can eat works is you order a first batch of 10 wings for ~$13, then after that you can order 5 wings at a time for refills. This would be decent if the wait wasn't so long between each order and receiving them. In terms of the food, the wings are about average. None of the flavors blew me away and each seemed to have some flaw. For example, the lemon pepper was way too salty.   This place is nothing spectacular. Avoid if possible."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything to write....this isn't as good as it's cracked up to be. I have had better luck at Chills or Applebes. I would avoid this place. Try either Wing Stop or the Wing Grill and Cafe."}
{"text":"We used to come here all the time for the great wings and equally great service. After a while,  the food started being not so good,  so we stopped going. Went back today after a long hiatus and I must say that I'm very disappointed in the service. My husband ordered the all you can eat wings, like he has many times before. It took forever for someone to even come back to our table and finally ask if we were ok. My husband had to ask for a refill (never had to do that before) and finally got more wings. The waitress then asked if he wanted her to put another order in and he said yes. Needless to say it was another long wait before he got his additional order of wings. This used to be one of out favorite places. Now, due to the shoddy service, I'm not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"$1 beer and $12.95 for AYCE wings. I am sold.  You can call this a small sports bar that happens to sell chicken or a chicken place that happens to sell beer.  They have a few small screen TVs and doesn't hold a lot of people.  But it does serve some pretty good chicken tenders which looked like were made from actual chicken meat not the processed stuff.  The wings were so and so but I guess you could compare them to Buffalo Wild Wings which is right across the street.  That's tough but I would probably come here versus BWW just because I perfer small businesses. Friendly service, chill environment, and some arcade machines, I'm a fan.  This is a solid 3.5 rating place."}
{"text":"The first attempt to try the all you can eat chicken wings did not go well. The restaurant smelled like nasty sewer! I asked the lady why does the place smell like this. She commented that they did some drainage and the sewer is unfortunately located in front of the restaurant... Literally in front of the entrance. At that time, I had to leave and did not try the wings because I could not stand the rancid aroma of the sewer!   Today, I gave them a chance and figured that it would be okay since it has been weeks from my last attempt. All you can eat wings is about $13 and they serve you 10 wings first and you can order more at 5 at a time.   One thing I hate about chicken wings if it's breaded and it sure was. It was greasy and I still ate it. I asked for my next 5 wings to be plain with no breading, had several hairs on the wings and it tasted unlikely. The hot sauce was watery and not like any others.  I managed to eat 1 1/2 more and left like a speeding bullet with just one thing on my mind.... Buffalo wild wings .48 cents Tuesdays! So now I'm at buffalo wild wings to satisfy my craving and with a lot of regrets from chicken bonz!"}
{"text":"They refill the drinks, they pickup your empty baskets and the bonzless strips are pretty big! The five strip combo should be enough food for almost anyone. The WiFi sometimes works but is nice that they offer it. There are many large televisions showing sports, so that is good if you want to catch a game and some wings. Taylor is so excellent at this location. She's the reason I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Hot diggity...I LOVE the chicken wings here! I was a bit unsure about this place since it got so many bad reviews, but I walked in and was greeted by the girls behind the counter almost immediately... I'm thinking... \"ok..no sign of mean attitude..yet?\" Hrm..Still I had my guard up, and it took a while for me to pick what sauces and combo I wanted but the girls explained all the flavors and I choose: Hot, Sweet Chili and Honey BBQ.. no regrets! OoOh so good! Wings came out piping hot and so crispy but the meat was seasoned perfectly and juicy too *dROol*  While I was there, I managed to strike a conversation with the server and I guess they have a new management so all of the girls are relatively new hires and really sweet. They must have gotten rid of that girl everyone's been complaining about, YIKES!   I'm glad I gave this place a shot, hot wings, good service, and a low key place to hang out with friends over beer & sports WOoHOO! No more paying $$$$ for cold wings at LV happy hour joints!!"}
{"text":"I just don't like the walk-in, order at the counter, then sit down and wait for your food to come out. It's just weird to me. The dude working was nice enough though and we were using our Groupon. We got salad bar, chicken tenders, buffalo chicken wings and lemon pepper wings.  I LOVE lemon pepper wings and they do them right here! A nice LEMONY and PEPPERY dry rub on the wings! NOM!!!"}
{"text":"Thought that this place was good. Walked in and was able to order right away and then make a salad. The salad bar is small, but stocked with fresh fares. I ordered the garlic parm chicken and was told that this is a rub that they put on the chicken after its done cooking. Got my food fast, and got to say I wasn't impressed with the flavors of this particular rub. I love it at BWW, but that is a wet sauce. I will try them again because they had a good variety and the prices were not bad."}
{"text":"We ventured in on V-day and there was maybe 4 other customers with us.  The girl behind the counter was very nice. We used a group-on deal and she was happy to have us there.  We ordered wings and beers with their salad bar.   The salad bar is not something I would rave about and would get 2 stars.  Iceberg lettuce that is slightly wilted...you can see that it has been there for half the day in not cool enough coolers.  The toppings were good and the dressing was fine... Something you would get at a work dining hall.   We sat down and drank our beers, the place looks fun and I love the décor.  We got 12 wings that were Sweet chili garlic and Hot. Both were good wings but nothing to go wild about. I would come back for the wings because the price is good. The beer is cheap."}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken wings in town. They are so large that I can barely maintain my grasp without them falling out of my hand because of the weight. I have been to the location on Decatur twice and this one is equally fantastic. We ordered 37 wings, large fries, and 2 ranches which came out to about $45 dollars. However, because of their special that was announced on Yelp this week, I got 50% off my meal.   The wings: we ordered 4 flavors and my favorite were lemon pepper and damn hot. The lemon pepper was exceptional and WAY better than Wing Stop's where it tastes a lot like oil with a hint of lemon. This lemon pepper really has a zing from the lemon and is as refreshing and light as a deep fried chicken wing could be. The damn hot was a solid spicy buffalo sauce and really isn't that hot. The fries were thin and delicious while the ranch made an excellent side-kick for the wings.   My only qualm is that it is definitely pricey (without promotions) and that my two orders of wings (25+12) didn't come with ranch. I will definitely come back to this location when the wing craving hits."}
{"text":"The wings here are DELISH!  We will definitely be back. It's refreshing to see an owner of an establishment stopping by their customers tables just to introduce themselves and check to make sure everything was to their liking. The guy that took our order was super friendly as well and explained how things worked when we told him it was our first time there.  My 11 year old daughter is really picky about her wings and said these were better than B-Dubs across the street."}
{"text":"I love a good restaurant with that homey mom&pop feel to it.   I know that Chicken Bonz is a franchise with another location across town (Sunset and Decatur), but this place definitely felt like a home away from home for  the bustling crowd of guests crammed in the tiny restaurant's eating space. Everyone seemed to know each other, the staff was friendly and remembered you by your face and not your order, and the food was fantastic as well.  Not to mention that they have a standing special of all you can eat chicken wings for $11.99 and all you can eat boneless chicken wings on Mondays (or Tuesdays..? Pardon my poor memory).  I went to this place with my teenage cousins and teenage brother and found it to be exactly the kind of place that a bunch of teenagers from the Green Valley HS area would frequent on a weekly basis. I don't blame them either.  For the price, the food is plentiful, tasty, and creative.  Not to mention that the actual chicken wings looked like they came from chickens that weight lifted and did steroids. Those things were huge! Four pieces usually don't mean a lot of meat for one person, but even for someone with practiced hearty appetite like myself, those four pieces filled me fine and dandy.   Also, in case anyone was wondering, the chili cheese were great! The chili is mighty flavorful and the fries are crispy and almost shoestring-like. As a self-proclaimed fanatic of anything chili-cheesed, these rank pretty high on my list. If you're not in the mood for chicken limbs, I'd say these would be a great alternative."}
{"text":"My brother and I tried this for the first time a few weeks ago and it was love at first bite. Since we wanted to try as many flavors as possible, we went for the all-you-can-eat special for $13 each. As noted in other reviews, the wings were FANTASTIC and ENORMOUS! I have never seen such massive wings in my entire life. My favorite flavors were the Teriyaki, hot and sweet chili - simply irresistible. Service was really good too, but possibly because it wasn't very packed on a Friday night.   My only complaint is the size of the first basket you are served with the all-you-can-eat special. There were literally 10-15 gigantic wings in this first basket. Given the size of the wings, it was extremely tough to get through this basket in order to make a pass at all the other flavors I wanted to try - sort of defeating the purpose of all-you-can-eat, in my opinion. To add on, each additional basket has at least 6-7 massive wings which further limits the ability to try all the flavors you want. Maybe that's their intention so you have to come back again to try the other flavors? Seems totally unnecessary to me. This is a great product, so no need to pull any tactics to reel potentially repeat customers in.  Anyway, I have wanted to go back again for the all-you-can-eat special but I'm not sure if I can stomach the massive first basket again - no matter how ridiculously tasty they are."}
{"text":"I love love love chicken wings, I basically order them whenever I go out if I can. If I was stuck on a deserted island and a genie  said \"You may have one food infinitely until you are rescued.\" ...I would reply \"chicken wings\"  ...So rolling with my two favorite ladies going to the SW to see a friend last Saturday the 2nd, and searched yelp for CHICKEN WINGS BURGERS in SW Nevada. Chicken Bonz came up as number 1 most reviewed for the SW.  So after we hit my friends, we went over to Chickn Bonz on Durango and Warm Springs. It's kinda hidden from the street as your going east to west on warm springs, so look for it behind a jack in the box I think it was.  Anyway, pulled up about 8pm on a Saturday night, got out of vehicle and.... fell in love instantly....with the sign i read.  ALL YOU CAN EAT CHICKEN WINGS - $12.95  Really!!? REALLY?!?! YIPPEE KI YEAAAAAAAA MOFO!  *ahem*  Anyway, proceeded inside, nice sports barish atmosphere with neon signs, and cool memorabilia on the wall, not a big sports fan so didn't really pay attention. Few video games, and nicely decorated. Ordered our food from the smokin' hot counter girl, that was mutli-tasking like a mofo. Good size crowd taking up most of the tables, got our pitcher, and chilled for about 10 minutes till we got our food. The girls ordered a juicy looking burger that they shared, totally enjoying the texas toast used as a bun instead of the normal McD's bun. Nice. For the AYCE you get 10 to start, and have to order in increments of 5 after that.   Ordered the Garlic Salsa somethin somethin at the counter of the about 10-12 different flavors they had. I can't remember because the counter girl was hot and I was distracted.   Anyway, I was expecting tiny little wings like you get at Hooters (I go for the wings) and l and behold, good size pieces of  wings filling up the little tray basket. slathered in my choice sauce. The cool counter person working by herself came up and apologized for it taking a little longer than expected, but she was single handedly handling the entire front by herself with about 15-20 customers on the floor, and about 8 in line AND asnwering the phone, and rocking getting everybody's order in. I worked retail/food the last 11 years and give her kudos, she even managed to compliment my homegirl's tattoo in the middle of all of it!  The wings filled me up surprisingly quick, convinced we were going to sit there for at least two hours  (my homegirls know I love wings) I ended up ordering just one more set of wings and I was content, fat and happy after just 15 wings. I was not surprised with the good size delicious wings, and threw in the  towel at 15. My friends were surprised I was done too. I only tasted the Garlic Chili and Teriyaki, but will go back to try the other ones.   Had a definitely enjoyable experience, wish the place was a little bigger, as far as choice of seating, but perfectly good time eating some wings.  I live in the north, but will drive down to the SW just for the service, atmosphere and great experience I had with my friends at this location, even though there's another one I guess 10 minutes away from where I live. (I asked the counter girl)  Good Job Chicken Bonz! and Good job Smokin hottie Counter Girl!  I shall return- 4 Stars for food and atmospher+ 1 Star Bonus for our server and overall hotness-making it 5 stars.   *Poof*"}
{"text":"Yes! finally I got to try Chicken Bonz. And it was close to my house. Recently opened (within the past week), I came home from work to find a menu and coupon for a free order of sweet potato tots under my door. That definitely gets me in.  I got take out. Free tots and 12 bone in wings. They have a bunch of flavors like different heat level buffalo sauces and some new flavors like sweet chili garlic. I got Honey BBQ and Oriental sesame.   These wings were great for bone in. Tons of meat on the bone, crispy, and both flavors were great. The tots were crispy and good.   I want to go back and try their all you can eat wing deal. They also have boneless wings and burgers on the menu. http://www.chickenbonz.com/menu.html They also have free wi-fi.   They are right across the street from a Buffalo Wild Wings but I hope they do good."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this venue is still known as \"Chicken Bonz\" as they had some weird long name on a banner out front.  I made an inquiry to the cashier about the All-You-Can-Eat and she said as a company they had to move it to Thursday only because they would run out of food and were in danger of going out of business!  That was a little disappointing to here, but  I settled with 12 wings.  They came out pretty fast, although the cashier is also the food runner so I can see if the place got any busier how much of a bottleneck that would create.  The wing quality was OK, it hit the spot since I was hungry, but I don't think they were as good as Buffalo Wild Wings and the price point is too similar to give up the B-Dubs experience.  I'll have to inquiry at the Warm Springs/Durango location to see if this is all-you-can-eat death is true!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Obviously fried chicken isn't the healthiest food on earth, but once a month I get that craving for good fried chicken. Their chicken is great, doesn't seem too fatty, and their sides are excellent too. A+"}
{"text":"Went with the rommate for lunch on tuesday. Dumb lucked out way into AYCE strips, they have wings every day, but the strips are only on tuesday.  There was a table of 14 construction workers, the lady at the counter apologized and said they'd do their best to get our order out in a timely fashion.   The AYCE starts off with 5 strips and the sauce of your choice, and then 3 strips and a sauce each time after that. The AYCE fries add on for $1 were good. The first batch was iffy, but the 2nd batch was much better, ask for some Xtra seasoned salt.  The Strips were decent sized, my only major complaint is that the sauces are served on the sides not tossed on the strips, but all in all it was good.  A great little place serving up some good chicken at a decent price, hard to beat. Plus they have $1 beers"}
{"text":"The wings were quite good but I found the chicken tenders to be dry even with them tossed in the sauce. The salad bar is pretty basic but for $7.99 6 wing and salad bar combo,  I was FULL.  Unfortunately the Saturday night we came here they seemed understaffed. The cashier was not old enough to pour beer so we had to skip it. I'd ask if the cook could come out and do it but he was super busy. They must have had someone call in sick cause just having the two of them seemed ridiculous.  I wondered where the manager or owner of the shop was to let this restaurant die a slow death without anyone to pour beer! There were quite a few tables that were dirty and needed to be cleared. I don't know why patrons don't do it themselves but with that said, restaurant management should have someone do it so the rest of the patrons don't have to sit in a dirty dining room.  I can't say I'd rush back here based on my first experience but the food was decent."}
{"text":"I stopped in here to pick up some lunch, the service was poor, I think the two employees were dating and fighting, keep your personal business at home!!!  ok i ordered a 5 piece to go and im almost positive that i was given the wrong thing, i ordered the spicy garlic one  and i got some pieces of chicken with what tasted like a asian sweet and sour sauce on the side. what the hell is that? i did not finish my meal and i will not be returning again. the only reason the got 2 stars instead of 1 is because the fries were delicious"}
{"text":"Wooooo chicken fingahs!  Pretty legit place for fingers and fries. There used to be a Chicken Bonz over on Sunset in Green Valley, but it has since become Chicken Shack, and Chicken Bonz was reborn right of the 215 on Decatur.  This place serves up reallllllly bomb chicken fingers, with a bunch of sauces that will satisfy even the pickiest of chicken connoisseurs. They also have regular bone in wings, and burgers (I don't know why I guess some people don't want chicken?).  Its a pretty interesting place, there are a couple of arcade machines set-up which definitely earns the place points because it takes a while to get the food sometimes. It seems to be a mom n pop kind of place so they do go the extra mile to make sure you are happy. Unlike Chicken Shack, there isn't a extra charge for a side of ranch which for me is a huge pet peeve.   If your in this part of town and craving good chicken stop by! Its worth it."}
{"text":"I used to be, for a very long time, a huge fan of Buffalo Wild Wings and would go there at least once or twice a week! But when a group of friends and I decided to grab lunch there, I immediately lost interest in BWW's!  The atmosphere is a fun, bar-like style with four or five flat screens covering the walls and a \"big ass fan.\"  Now for the most important part--the food. Obviously chicken wings,(Bonz), are their specialty as well as chicken tenders, (Bonzless). The chicken is freakin delicious! It's got to be some of the best chicken for a place of it's kind in Vegas. They have twelve different sauces ranging from Lemon Pepper to Damn Mistake, which you can have as a dipping sauce or have your chicken tossed in it.  If you aren't a fan of chicken, or simply not in the mood for it, Chicken Bonz also offers really unique burgers served on Texas Toast! Another popular choice is the salad bar, for those of you who don't like tasty animals....   The prices are very reasonable. A 5 piece bonz or bonzless combo, with fries and a drink, is $7.95, a burger with fries and a drink is $6.95-8.95, depending on the size, and the salad bar is $4.95 for one time through.   Chicken Bonz is definitely a great place to have a bite to eat with your friends and enjoy some delicious food!"}
{"text":"quick service great wings, great deals on food"}
{"text":"This would have been a 2-star review if it was solely based on the food. Unfortunately, the food was only part of the problem.  I went here last weekend with a friend on his recommendation. Right after he ordered and sat down the girls behind the counter began snickering and making fun of him. They didn't realize I was with him until I rather angrily brought up that he was my friend, then they shut up.   The food itself? Its mediocre as hell. I ordered the 6 wing and fries combo and what I got was wings that were barely sauced, overly breaded and that tasted almost metallic. The fries were straight out of the frozen food section at Sams Club and tasted like sticks of styrofoam. And after waiting nearly 20 minutes for WINGS and FRIES, the food was lukewarm. If you keep me waiting, the food had damn well better be hot when I get it.  One more note: the server (I noticed) was avoiding us and the group that was seated  behind us (minorities), but was going out of her way to attend to the white frat boys on the patio every five minutes. Read into that what you will.   I will NEVER go back to Chicken Bonz again."}
{"text":"We are so happy to have this chicken wing place near us.  We have been wanting to try it since we saw it recently.  So we decided it would be a good place for a Sunday lunch (I know, it makes no sense.)  The waitresses were super friendly, the service was quick.  I ordered the salad bar, it's limited choices and only allows one trip through but it's cheap.  The boy ordered 2 different types of wings, garlic parm and hot, as well as their sweet tater tots.  We weren't disappointed in anything.  The salad bar is limited but that's ok with me and the dressings were good.  I love wings that are \"dry\" and still moist and tasty.  The garlic parm wings were just that.  Tasty, moist and crispy.  The hot wings were hot, we are kind of crazy about spice, but not super hot.  They have two levels higher so I can imagine if you want to cry and sweat there is that opportunity, we'll try it next time.  The tater tots were really good and flavorful as well.    It was the day after st. patty's day, so I will give them a pass but there was no beer left at all.  That was too bad.  But all in all it was a great experience and we will be going back.  Love it!"}
{"text":"We purchased the groupon that says it expires by a certain date, we went on that date because like most groupons it expires after that. When I went to the cashier to use it she nicely tried to explain to me that it expired and another man that worked there RUDELY told me it expires before that date not through that day. Then tries to degrade me saying it was only $6 like I was being cheap. That was not the point of using the groupon since I had never been there before, that groupon opened my eyes that it was there and we eat out alot. i had to step out of line and almost started crying because of this rude employee. I told him I wasn't arguing with him and he walked away. He was rude to another group of men sitting by us so I know he is just an unhappy person. We debated even eating there, but did, since I've always wanted to try it. Food was pretty good which is why the 2 stars and the cashier was a nice woman but it's a shame this one experience will never get me into another chicken bonz anywhere because no one deserves to be treated like that."}
{"text":"It was my first time ever going here. The food was really good. My aunt brought me here. Apparently the name hasn't been changed on Yelp yet but its now called Meat, Chix, and Weiners. I got a 12 piece chicken finger with honey bbq sauce. I wasnt a big fan of the sauce but the fingers came out steaming hot and were way better then Raising Canes in my opinion. I highly recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Came here for the BOGO when you check in with the Yelp app, if it wasn't for that then I would be quite disappointed.   6 wings, some fries and a drink for a price of $7.99, ouchie! Not that bad when you get 12 wings, a lot of fries, and two drinks for $7.99. Went with the flavors that I usually order from Wing Stop which were lemon pepper and honey BBQ, not bad, but not going to pull me away from Wing Stop or Buffalo Wild Wings anytime soon. I did notice that the wings were slightly bigger.  Parking and service was as good as it gets for a chicken wing joint.   Anyways come back if the BOGO is available, but if not tread water carefully."}
{"text":"Ok this place conflicts me so much...  Me and the bf went here one night and I was conflicted if i liked the place or not lol, I ordered the bone in parmesan chicken wings with fries and a drink. I must say I love how big the chicken wings are and the way they fry them is delicious but i wasn't a fan of how they do the parmesan they just sprinkle it on so half of the wings were just plan because the parmesan wasn't sticking to it. I usually go to wing stop and i love the way the do there parmesan wings its more like a sauce rather then just throwing it on so if chicken bonz had wingstops parmesan sauce they would have been alot better. I'm not a fan of their fries either there thin and tasteless.   I thought this place was ok and its a bit pricey I'm not sure if I would return here I might just stick with my wing stop and call it a day."}
{"text":"Changed owners and the name. Epic fail! Prices have almost doubled as has the wait time."}
{"text":"Chicken wings? How can you say no! You just can't go wrong with chicken wings. Hi five to them for providing an awesome 20% check in discount. I just ordered a simple 5 piece bone in chicken parmesan deal. No combo. Total came to $4.95 after the discount.   The chicken was awesome! A nice crisp outer crunch and a tender juicy center. How many bites does it take to get to the bone? I'll never know...  The only downside was that the 2 offerings I was looking forward to wasn't delivered. They had free wifi, but I couldn't connect. $1 draft beer! I was so stoked, but alas, they were tapped out (no pun intended!) Figures. $1 beer was just too good to be true. Why offer $1 beer for people to look forward to and then be out of beer. Big sad face to that!  Here's are a few offerings I noticed as well:  75 cents extra for ranch or blue cheese (but that's a given I think any chicken wing joint charges for sauce)  $12.95 for all you can eat chicken wings  $7.50-$8.00 for a 5 piece chicken wing combo depending if it's bone in or out  Burgers come with fries and are made with Texas toast for buns.  Flat screens to watch that game you had just placed a bet for. I know that's a big plus for all you sports fans!  It's a very hip little joint to go to if you want to grab a good bite to eat alone or with friends!"}
{"text":"I like that there is a more local alternative to Buffalo Wild Wings, I'll always try to go local over a nationwide.  In this case however, I think I'll take BWW.  I have been here on a couple of occasions and have felt deflated after each attempt.  The batter is slightly soggy and the atmosphere is quite dank and vacant feeling, even with people there.  There's much better alternatives out there."}
{"text":"As a fried chicken /hot wing fan I highly recommend this place to any chicken lover. Their wings are huge. I've been in a wing eating contest where I ate almost 40 wings. Whenever I go to chicken bonz I can never finish more than 18  even if I want to."}
{"text":"A surprise for sure! I suppose it helps when you have zero expectations going in for a meal and you come out full, not broke, and with leftovers!  This place has mixed ambiance.  Part sports bar, part family friendly, part salad bar? Odd.    The salad bar is what you would expect: basic romaine lettuce and a myriad of toppings.  Pleasantly surprised by how clean and fresh everything was.  It could be vastly improved with a nice spring mix in place of the bland romaine; alas, die hard salad bar fans would likely disagree.  We had wings, fingers and sweet potato tots.  We tried two different flavors of sauce.  It was nice that they were on the side so you could pick and choose and dip or not dip.  Chicken was very good.  Tots were tasty.    A nice neighborhood spot to hit for a quick dinner with the fam.  Nothing to blow your mind but plenty to fill your belly without breaking the bank.    I'd go again!"}
{"text":"12.00 bucks all you can eat wings is pretty cool. Service was alright. The taste the wings I would give a 4/10, their wings have a different taste idk what it is but I didnt like it. I prefer hooters, buy 20 get 20 wings at hooters on Tuesday's."}
{"text":"I wouldn't want to mess with the chickens that these wings came from. They're gigantic. It's like they did a few leg presses before they met the butcher.  Thanks to my handy Yelp app, I was able to get a \"buy one get one free\" combo just by checking in for the first time. Pretty slick. Came up to around $10 total for two 8 piece combos. You're able to choose from a variety of wet or dry sauces for your wings. We went with the following:  -Garlic Parmesean: Fried to perfection, with a delightful crisp. Not too greasy either. Goes awesomely with the bleu cheese. -Teriyaki: Pretty much what you'd expect from the name. Standard teriyaki wing sauce. If this is your thing, it's not bad. I'm not the biggest fan of dousing my wings with teriyaki. -Sesame: Loved the sweet glaze on these wings. Adds a unique twist. Good choice if you're not a fan of dipping the wings in ranch or bleu cheese, since these wings are great on their own.  The skinny fries that these combos came with were also a pretty nice complement to the wings. Dipping them into the bleu cheese was fatteningly satisfying enough to fulfill any of my manly instincts. Plus, with the walls surrounded by gigantic TVs on every corner, it's a great place to check out a game.    Note: One thing that stood out to me were the All You Can Eat Wings for $12.95, which I'm definitely going to take advantage of on the next visit. Get this deal while a game is going on and you're good to go."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of traditional chicken wings and haven't tried them here, but I do really enjoy their boneless wings. The chicken is always freshly breaded and fried to order. The fries are good too, skinny and crisp. And the value is outstanding, for like 7 bucks you get 5 really large boneless wings and fries. I love when a place specializes in one item and does just that item and does it well... This is one of those places, give it a try."}
{"text":"Discovered this place a few weeks ago, I have only had their chicken fingers, but  they are awesome! The fingers battered kind of like \"raising canes,\" but they offer hot sauces and ranch, and canes does not. I have been here 3 or 4 times, and the service was always great and fast. I would give this place 5 stars, but the ranch dressing is a little on the watery side, but still very good."}
{"text":"Very good meaty chicken wings seasoned well and great size for ur money. Sweat potato tots are very good just need a dipping daises will be going back for sure"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never reviewed Chicken Bonz!  I am way behind on my yelping!  I wish they offered a 8 wing option, because that is my magic number.  6 and I feel unsatisfied,  and 12, well, I physically cannot do 12, no matter how hard I try and I really wish I could!  I normally get Honey BBQ and Sweet Chili Garlic. That sweet chili garlic, well, great, I am drooling now like Pavlov's dog. I don't loooove the honey bbq, but I don't do buffalo sauce and I don't like a lot of spice.  Because they are breaded, they get soggy really fast, we used to get our bonz to go, but they are 100x better if you eat in. Even our 5 minute drive home ruins them.  Get the sweet potato tots and extra ranch - then drink the ranch.   My complaint, the darn red neon sign in there.  It's awful, and triggers my migraines."}
{"text":"AYCE chicken wings for $12.95! I'm in chicken heaven!!! I love chicken wings! Had this place bookmarked for a while and finally got to try it out this past weekend. here's how it works:  10 wings per person for 1st order 5 wings per person for orders after that You can order as much as you want Pick and mix sauces. Lemon Pepper and Garlic Parmesan are the only 2 dry rubs. Order up front first, then the waitress will come around and take your order every time after that.  The Lemon Pepper is my favorite. They have a Cayenne garlic Parmesan flavor too, my second favorite. Blue cheese or ranch dipping sauce. The wings are pretty big compared to the wings in the SGV. They have a soda fountain so free refills as well. $1 beer gets you a small cup of beer on certain brand. Others are $1.50.   They also have combos you can order if AYCE is not your thing. They take pre-order if you're planning a party. The boyfriend and I ate 15 wings each. Well worth my money!"}
{"text":"So, I came to this place a few months back for the 1st time, and just like some of the bad reviews I saw I felt the service was a little slow and not very friendly.  There was only 1 person taking orders and serving the food to the customers eating there.  Wasn't impressed at all.  Yesterday, a co-worker wanted to try the place, and I had a coupon to use, so I decided to go again, warning my friend that it may take a while to get our grub.  I am glad I went back!    This time the place was full of customers, everyone was smiling and the vibe felt way better.  The cute little girl taking orders was friendly and helpful with our order, there were two gentlemen helping throughout the main restaurant area that were friendly and talkative and helpful as we waited for our order.  Seems like the fixed the earlier issues and are now on the right pace.  Well Done!!  I now look forward to going back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in the neighborhood looking for something to eat and saw Chicken Bonz and thought we'd check it out.   First off the staff was very friendly and welcoming and since it was our first time explained all our options for us.  My girlfriend got a six piece \"bonz\" (wings) combo and I got the 5 piece \"bonzless\" (chicken strips) combo.  My strips were pretty bland and I tried the wings but I felt like I could get better out of a frozen dinner.  Not worth the money when there's a Buffalo Wild Wings across the street."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place. Classier than I thought. Grilled chicken is good and so are the sauces. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Bomb ass place! Great food,  $1 draft beers kids eat free with adult combo plus 20% off with check-in how can you go wrong with this place?! Btw Jill is awesome!"}
{"text":"Right when you walk into the place, your hit with a strange smell... Like dirty mop.  I got used to it after awhile though.  Anyway, the place itself was cool. Clean and I really liked the decorations. Lots of cool stuff to look at.  Its also pretty roomy with plenty of places to sit.  We got the chicken wings with bone and chicken fingers combo meals.  The wings were big! I got the garlic parmesan wings (thinking it would be like wing stops).  It was actually just plain wings with parmesan cheese on top of it.  It wasn't anything special I'd say.  My boyfriend got the chicken fingers with bbq sauce.  I think that the fingers are comparable to cane's.  The bbq sauce was kinda weak in my opinion... very watery.  Other than that, the fingers were moist and cooked well.  I really liked the fries that came with the meal - but thats because I really like shoe string fries.  Overall, I think this place is medium - neither great or bad.  I would probably come back if I wanted wings real quick."}
{"text":"I tried 3 different things on the menu to try their range. First, the chili cheese fries were awesome.  They are the only thing that might redeem this place. I tried their cheeseburger.  Eh, it's okay.  About as good as you can expect for a place that specializes in chicken.  Last, I tried their boneless chicken.  Chicken fingers that are overcooked, dry, and have thick breading that is tasteless. I tried 3 sauces: sweet chili, ranch, and bleu cheese.  Seriously, the bleu cheese tastes like mayo (and nothing like bleu cheese), the ranch tastes like cole slaw (and nothing like ranch), and I couldn't stomach the sweet chili after smelling the rancid sauce.  I think I'll go back to get some chili cheese fries on my way to Farmer Bros or KFC."}
{"text":"Best chicken wings I have had in a real long time. They were meaty and crisp but not loaded with excess fried batter. Bon has about nine flavors and I recommend all of them save for the lemon pepper.   So if you're looking to pig out on chicken wings or if you just want to a couple you can not go wrong with Chicken Bonz"}
{"text":"I had the AYCE on a tuesday night with a bud light lime for ~15.  - Service was hardworking. It seemed like they had one cashier that was taking and waiting on orders and one cook. Service was very slow. I would wait 15min just to get in my refill order. At times, orders would get mixed up. Easy solution would be to hire another waiter.  - Too hot. Not the chicken, it's pretty tolerable. The restaurant has one huge fan. A group of customers had to complain just to have them turn on the AC.  - Chicken wings were pretty delicious. My favorite is lemon pepper and garlic parmesan. Although, that is always my favorite, regardless where I go. Lemon pepper is a bit too salty. Damn hot is a bit deceiving initially. It takes a few or so chickens to make it a mistake. haha. I didn't try damn mistake.  - Boneless chicken is dry. Don't waste stomach space for it. Buffalo sauce is a dip. how lame.  - Sweet tea is too sweet. Sweeter than Mcdonalds. It takes A LOT of ice to make it cold also.  - I'd come back, but probably to their other location."}
{"text":"Awesome wing place! You really cannot beat all-you-can-eat wings with a drink for around $15!! Everyone was really friendly, we were checked on to make sure everything was ok AND our wing refills came out FAST! Check out the Asian sesame wings... Just awesome.   The table next to us was having some chicken fingers and they looked juicy and almost as big as half a chicken breast...I will try them out next time. Oh and if you are in the mood for a beer, you can get a cold one for $1. Come check them out."}
{"text":"I've had better wings but this place gets some props for the wings being cooked perfectly and not greasy.  I usually just make my own wings at home in the deep fryer but I've been wanting to try Chicken Bonz since they opened here in Vegas ( I am so over Buffalo Wild Wings and have been for a while) (Wing Stop is okay for a quick craving fix). The service was excellent, helped us through the menu since it was our first time, and made sure we were doing alright while we were there.  We got a large fry which was bigger than the 2 of us needed, loved them, thin and crispy, good taste, not greasy. We got 25 wings to split which they allowed us to get with 4 different sauces (BBW eat your heart out). Parmesan garlic were okay a little dry and not alot of taste, hot was okay with good heat and okay taste, spicy bbq were pretty good, and the sweet chili garlic were both of our favorite...would definitely get those again. Prices are alright, the 1$ Bud draft is a kick ass deal. We would go back again, especially to try out some more flavors."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Wings are spiced perfectly!  Sauces are good...prices are super affordable!! Waaaaaayy better than Buffalo Wild Wings by far!!  Really family friendly too!!! :-)"}
{"text":"We popped in for dinner and were very happy with the customer service. The girl taking our order was very pleasant and had a great demeanor and our waitress was really on top of things as well.  Food wise we think it's OK but nothing spectacular. The wings really reminded me of Hooters' wings in size, texture of breading and flavor, I had the \"hot\". The wife enjoyed the salad bar and added grilled chicken breasts which were extremely bland and had no seasoning.  $1 for a 12oz beer ain't too shabby and the service was great. Will we be back? Possibly, but at least we now know what to expect going in... Decent wings, cheap beer and good service."}
{"text":"I've been on the fence for a while about this place but m going to give it a mild endorsement.  The \"bonzless\" tenders are cooked to a perfect texture and coated in a crisp batter that stands up equally well on its own and with sauce.  As is my tendency, I go for the spiciest sauce - the Damn Mistake, which packs a real sting to the face. It's not vision quest hallucination sweaty spicy like Thai peppers but this is among the spiciest non-novelty wing sauce I've tasted. As noted elsewhere, the sauce is served in the side.  Their fries are surprisingly good - very thin, crisp shoestrings that retain a nice snap even once they're cool. They're salty and seasoned flavorfully.  $1 gets you your choice of a draft Bud or an orange creamsicle to put out the fire.  They do AYCE wings for $12.95 daiy, AYCE bonzless Tuesdays. I guess AYCE fries are a buck.  The salad bar is pretty sad looking. But let's get real. You're at a wing joint, the only veggies you have any business eating are dunked in blue cheese or ranch.  Much better than Raising Cane's, incidentally, if a little pricier."}
{"text":"I love some good chicken wings and they have not lost the chicken wing fight in my opinion this review update is definitely more about the Manager or Owner that was at this location the other night. We go to this location quite a bit and always order the all you can eat wings and add a single basket of all your can eat fries for the table and have never had an issue. This time while eating the Mangager/Owner walked by while we were eating and just stared at our table like we ha killed someone or something which I found odd until the awesome waitress came over and said hey sorry guys but he  saw that you all are sharing the basket of fries so he is not going to refill them for you if you want a refill. Here is what struck me wrong.   1. If you are the owner or manager or just the big cheese on duty at the time... YOU HANDLE IT. don't send the poor waitress to tell YOUR customers that you have some crappy rule that nobody knows about and basically tell them that you are taking the extra money they paid for AYCE fries and keeping it because you want to be a D#$k  2. Post a sign that says you can not share the fries.  I'm pretty sure we had been told by a different waitress that we could order one basket and share them amongst the table. But maybe that is why she doesn't work there anymore, the fry Nazi must of gotten ahold of her.   3. Don't stand at the kitchen entrance when we are leaving with that dumb smirk on your face and say, \" Have a great night\" I am not a person that angers easily but I have to say that last shot while we are on the way out is ridiculous.   This has been our go to chicken wing joint and this whole incident really bothered me. It is not because we wanted more fries it was just the principle of the thing.  He could have walked over and said hey guys I'm sorry but we don't allow sharing of the AYCE fries so if you want to kick in the other $2 I can continue to refill it for you. but that is obviously not how it went down."}
{"text":"The plan was to make homemade teriyaki portabello sandwiches for dinner and on the drive home I realized that i was tired and did not want to cook today.. So I turned to the never fail you Yelp searching for something good to eat. Guess what happened, I found Chicken Bonz...  I happen to enjoy a good wing every now and again and decided that this was a perfect fit for what my taste buds happen to be asking for, something spicy, crunchy, tasty and all around amazing.   If your still with me this is where the fun began, we drove over to C. Bonz and when we arrived the place was packed, and I mean no place to sit and 4 person deep line packed. After taking in how busy this place was we started scanning the menu, I see that 12 wings are roughly $12 but on the special little chalkboard below the menu i see scribbled in chalk that every day is all you can eat wing day for $11.99, You better believe Mr. Raymond went for the AYCE for 11.99. I ordered the Hot BBQ which was really good but did not have the kick that I was expecting. This wings happen to be huge and the atmosphere was okay. Some of the clientele seemed a little shady but as long as they do not try to snag my wings it's all good.   Obviously I enjoyed this place and yes i would go back but here is the breakdown of good and bad.  Good: 1. The chicken wings are on steroids and are gigantic 2. They are cooked just right and had the perfect amount of sauce  3. The $11.99 Price point is Money!! not in literal terms people. 4. The service was awesome, as in friendly  Bad/ Downside:  1. It took FOREVER to get our food 2. You have to pay for any ranch or dipping sauce there is non included 3. The dining area is small- I don't know that this is a bad thing..  My star rating of 4 stars is all due to the quality of the wings. The one star loss was due to the long wait for the wings when initially ordered.   Overall, I say YES... Try this place at least once, this is a great alternative to your normal cookie cutter Buffalo Wild Wings type place.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I never thought I was able to eat 35 wings in one sitting but apparently I am!  Maybe I'll add that to my resume in the future.    I am on board with everyone else's opinion.  It's a 3 star place!  No more, no less.  $14 or whatever it is for all you can eat wings is reasonable.  $1 drafts are nice as well.   It's great they don't charge a ridiculous price for celery like Buffalo Wild Wings or Hooters who charge somewhere around $3 for ranch and celery.  81 cents here.  I am boring and don't care about the teriyaki, bbq or parmesan garlic wings.  I just want 'em hot."}
{"text":"Extremely random visit to Chicken Bonz yesterday afternoon and it was pretty tasty! We had the lemon pepper and garlic parmesan, super deelish. We were going to do the all you can eat, but weren't quite sure how we'd like them. The all you can eat is so worth it, $12.95 for all you can eat is a great deal! The wings were enormous and the blue cheese tasted like they made it fresh!! Huge chunks of blue cheese and creamy..Definitely will be heading back there for some more."}
{"text":"I so wanted to love this place. We are from San Diego and we are use to Dirty Birds which have TONS of sauce options. First I was thrown off because I don't like my wings breaded. However, the size of the wings were good and my husbands chicken fingers were HUGE. I wish they had more flavors."}
