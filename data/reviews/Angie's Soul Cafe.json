{"text":"Hey Stopped in here to grab a late lunch, I ordered the Fish Sandwich with Fries and a giant mason jar full of lemonade, The food was great the fish was crispy and delicious, the staff was incredible, they were super helpful and friendly, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland for the Joint College of Bishops annual congress, and we ate at Angie's practically every day. The food was good and the servers were kind & accommodating. Service was a little slower when the place was full, but that's to be expected. Will definitely be eating there again when we're back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Very tasty!  One person in our party had smothered pork chops.  Another had salmon crochet.  Both had Mac and cheese.  One had collards the other had cabbage. I had the Salisbury steak, pintos and mash potatoes.  Everything was delicious.  Customer service was excellent.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The banana pudding is the best I've ever had!! And I've had a lot of banana pudding!! And hey have cool aid. The irks wasn't my fav but they swapped it out- that's customer service."}
{"text":"Meatloaf is Tuesday special. We ordered an additional dinner as well. The food was excellent. I prepared a small dish of leftovers for my lunch. After I warmed it in  1 of the kitchenette at my place of work. 1 of my fellow co- workers came over and Asked was that my dinner smelling so very delicious."}
{"text":"It's a shame that your food can be so good and receive such terrible customer service from the females in this establishment. They all acted if they could care less about their jobs and forget giving the paying customers some real attention. Get some women with some personality! We visited from out of town and the carpet was darker inside than the dirt outside. How does the whole interior carpet get that dirty and that be acceptable to the owners and the Health Department? UNACCEPTABLE! Sorry, but papers strewn in your foyer was the first clue that you don't pay attention to neatness or cleanliness. First impressions go a long way. Your customers deserve better."}
{"text":"I have been going to Angie's for a while. The food was yummy when I first started going. I would get the veggie meal and things were smooth. Problem #1 The foods with juice such as greens, cabbage, green beans and yams aren't separated from the corn muffin which makes it soggy. When I told the staff to wrap it separate she got an attitude and told me that it doesn't get wet. #2 The customer service is horrible, a man was selling the cashier a necklace while she was ringing me out. Wouldn't ya know it, she stopped to exam the jewelry and make an offer all the while acting as though I wasn't a paying customer. He then came back with the ok to sell and she proceeded to purchase with me still waiting to be cashed out. I finally had to interrupt so that I could finish my transaction. He apologized BUT THE WORKER just chuckled like it was no biggie. #3 Food isn't consistent, one day the yams are slamming and they next time they are subpar. The black eye peas were good the first few times then they started to taste as if sugar was being added O and let's talk about the reason I really came back for the last time, my daughters order was screwed up days prior to that so she was owed a free meal. Moral of the story... if you want to support them, be ok with being annoyed, sub par customer service and lightweight being  mistreated. Peace  Update Feb '18: I believe in giving peeps another chance, sometimes even multiple chances but yikes... I wasn't sure if I walked into a restaurant or club, the music was super loud and the service was well....slooooooooooow. I just wanted some pie!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing. Everyone was so nice and helpful. It was basically like walking into a place & everyone working there is instantly your best friend. The macaroni & cheese was kind of slimy, though & bland. Maybe it was just an off day. The food was prepared in a timely manner. The collard greens were excellent as was the chicken, mashed potatoes & catfish. The catfish was probably the best part of the whole meal. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"What can I say? This place is NICE! Stopped here for dinner while on travel for work.  Took a minute to find the place as it moved from the area I knew it was in. The new spot is bigger and the only thing it really lacks is decent parking.  The food was great! I had meatloaf and it was good. I also had yams and greens. The cornbread was good too. For dessert I had my usual, sweet potato pie, and it was decent (a little cold, but good).  The topper was the look in a mason jar!  Yeah I'm coming back before I go!"}
{"text":"Great food! Sweet tea was a bit too sweet, but everything else is very good.  Smothered chicken was delicioous along with the Mac & Cheese, cabbage and lemon cake.  All vegetables are cooked with no meat but seasoned very well.  This place is what soul food taste like.....a Cleveland staple!"}
{"text":"Short...ordered chicken wings and fries with sauce.  Wasn't fan of the BBQ sauce, didn't like the fries nor the chicken wings."}
{"text":"I haven't been in year's I see why the service is slow, where staff this short, it's 2:00 it's dirty and nasty tables not clean. The cashier is slow the corn bread  hard warm up from microwave  the greens are always tuff. The Mac cheese hard over cook the bottom of pan, webstern ribs was tender not hot Luke warm been sitting in warmer a long time. The Kool aid is Good. This is why I don't come to Angie's"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a group of six. The staff was friendly and the service was quick. My only issue was that the food wasn't great. I ordered fried chicken mac and cheese and cabbage. None of it was bad, but none of it was great either."}
{"text":"The only reason they get 1 star is because no stars isn't an option. I was served old chicken that tasted refried, an extreme dry waffle and burnt Mac n cheese. This place was a complete waste of time!"}
{"text":"Tight chicken slam. Didn't get to meet Angie herself but from what I gather she likes to party."}
{"text":"My husband picked up 2 dinners, on his way home from work, on a Friday evening.  We both ordered the catfish dinner, which included 2 large catfish fillets, cooked and seasoned perfectly and 2 sides, we both opted for fries and coleslaw.  He also ordered a side of spaghetti.  The coleslaw definitely tasted better than it looked.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  The fries were hand-cut, which is always a plus.  I even tasted the spaghetti, which was tasty too.  I would definitely return to Angie's."}
{"text":"Attention all...this is a famous \"Brandon's Five Star Rating\", of the highest caliber. I ate here for the first time this Sunday afternoon. It is now my favorite restaurant in Cleveland.  I've been a bit disillusioned with Yelp lately, having to read a bit too much about Melt, some dude named Symon, stuff that's \"handcrafted\" and all that garbage that can occasionally make normal people nauseous.  I cured that today.   Angie's Soul Food Cafe.  Located on the Southwest corner of Superior and East 39th Street, this place is a true gem that should be cultivated and cherished. I've been looking for a place like this since I moved back last August.  Walking in, I was surprised by the inside. Not fancy, but meticulously clean and spacious. The floors are nicely polished wood, with standard formica-type tables. The ceilings are soaring high, and covered with the old tin coating. There are two separate dining areas; I ended up in the one where the ordering station is, with a great view out the gigantic front window of the train trestle and the newly blooming trees taking over the abandoned buildings and lots. It teared me up with memories of the Bronx and Greenpoint, Brooklyn.  I was instructed to head over to the register when I was ready with my order, which took a moment to figure out as it was my inaugural visit. They have your standard southern fare and sides. Everyone who works there is friendly and allow you to take your time.  I had the 2 piece fried chicken meal, which you can get with one ($6) or two ($8) sides. I got two sides, collard greens and candied yams.  The chicken was about as spot-on as you can imagine, crispy on the outside and somehow juicy on the inside. The yams were Of God, cut in cubes and set inside a sweet sauce that you can mush together to make a dish that could be served as a dessert. The collard greens were exactly as I like them (which not everyone would agree with), plain in a bit of their own juices. I know some folks like them with ham hocks, which I don't.   They gave me two pieces of cornbread, and I ordered a bottled rootbeer to wash it down. I still haven't eaten the cornbread. That's for tonight's snack.  They also have assorted cakes and sweet potato pie. I didn't have nearly enough room to try any of them...but they looked homemade.  And what do you know? The bathrooms are spotless.  So yeah, I've found my new spot in Cleveland. It's as if my life is completely coming together.   But...isn't that what southern soul food all about? Bringing things (people) together?  There's parking on the front of the building (a restored century building) or on the side. The only way I can *possibly* think of improving the place is to put up a bike rack.   This place is perfection. Though, I can't imagine that we'll see the owners of Angie's on TV anytime soon....they're too busy feeding the hardworking people of Cleveland with reasonably priced, exceptionally tasting food."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in awhile so I decided to try it today. The food was ok. Nothing to necessarily complain about but also nothing to make me want to go back. Luckily it wasn't too salty this time, I guess it depends on the cook. I had the veggie dinner (just sides) and I was so looking forward to the Mac n cheese.... it was just ok. Black eye peas and rice was good. The greens will be going on the garbage. The 3 stars are for the service the staff was awesome. I snapped a pic before I tossed it."}
{"text":"So par for the course of not so great soulfood in Cleveland.  Black people and my people from the South/Southern US this is not the business. Find a Black church cooking meals they might do better. This food is very take it or leave it and they do not know how to manage food allergies so goodluck with that. I ordered grilled chicken with no gravy. It is not worth $8.00."}
{"text":"Had chicken and waffles before and it was decent. My man got the kool aid last time and it was straight sugar water."}
{"text":"Very good soulfood. Try either the Catfish or smoothered chicken. The best sides are the mac and cheese and yams. Greens on point as well. Their meatloaf will also melt in your mouth. Food is always fesh and good, but only thing keeping them from a 5 star rating was the rude lady at the register with glasses who's an older woman. I treated my girlfriend and mother for Mother's day weekend and when we placed our orders and they asked about the deserts she replied to them rudely and was short.   I would've left out if not for being hungry at the time. Then she proceeded to treat I guess \"regulars\" or people she knew like angels. Our money spent the same as theirs. She also lied to me after me giving her a big bill she says they don't have change in the register with a straight face trying to guilt me into telling her to keep the change and forcing me to leave her a tip. I just stood her out and she pulled change from the suppossedly no change register smh....  Here's a tip for you lady treat people with respect, b/c you never know who they are, what they do, and who or what they know. Our server Damion was good and him plus the food saved our experience and this rating."}
{"text":"Umm, yes please.   This was the most satisfying meal I've had in a long, long time. (I've been tending to my diet lately...)   This is an \"order at the counter\" kind of place, but these lovely ladies will bring you your food. And let me tell you, they're sweeties!   I ordered the tilapia, which came with two filets, breaded and fried in a cornmeal based breading. Yes! No fishy taste, very light, crunchy and flakey in the center. I tried pouring some hot sauce over 'em and they were even then they were good.   The larger sized entrees come with two sides, so I ordered the green beans, mac n cheese and the collard greens. Yes, I got an extra side because I couldn't decide. The green beans were just eh, the mac'n cheese wasn't really my type. I like a rich, creamy sauce, not the baked kind. These noodles had seen better days, trust me. But for those of you who love baked mac, this would be right up your alley. But those collard greens? Oh man, those are good stuff. I know a lot of folks like them with more bacon-y, porky and salty taste, but these were perfect for me. I added them into each bite of tilapia.   My dinning companions also ordered some luscious items for us to try. DO NOT skip on the oxtails. The order is small and they're a little pricey, but you'll thank me. These luscious, tender pieces of beef will make you swoon. Speaking of swooning, coming from a gal who literally hates yams, these bad boys were life-altering. As in, I know only like yams if they're from Angie's. It tastes like they're in this cinnamon-y, honey and brown sugar infused sauce... just trust me here. Even if you don't like sweets (like me) you'll think these are delicious.   We didn't get to taste the corn bread, which I assumed came with every meal, but I suppose not. Oh well. I can't wait to come back to try more! Get it, Angies!"}
{"text":"Great service,A group of friends came to try it out, not disappointed, great food, oxtails delicious, black eyed peas, great, catfish yummy, sweet tea just right, served in a mason jar. Fried chicken and waffles average but still good, the server was very good, friendly prompt. Everyone working seemed happy, read other reviews and well some people need to just eat McDonald's crap.bring y your appetite and enjoy this place."}
{"text":"We ordered Beef tips and a Fried Catfish \"sandwich\" and were told that we'd get cornbread on the side. The beef tips were not great, it felt like they had been sitting in the tray all day. They weren't fresh and they good enought that we would order them again. The collards were kind of good, sweet with bacon, but again it tasted like they had been sitting there for a while. The Fried catfish \"sandwich\" was really just a piece of fried fish (which on it's own was seasoned well) and 2 slices of bread... thats ridiculous. On top of it all, we didn't get any cornbread. I don't know whether they ran out, or whether they decided that a slice of bread counts as cornbread (the beef tips also came with a slice of bread) but it was really disappointing. The dishes both came with fries which were standard and probably the best part of the meal  I would still like to go to the Angie's on Superior Ave to compare, but I'm not in a rush after that experience"}
{"text":"Terrible service at 1:50pm today! I ordered the western ribs with fried corn and mash. I paid and tipped before i got my meal. So I'm patiently waiting as they take other orders. 15 mins go by and I'm still waiting. I asked how long will it be for my food? She stated that \"she's about to make it\" for her to come back to be 15 mins later to tell me you don't have the ribs. Very disappointed in the lack of customer service!"}
{"text":"We tasted several things, the best of the bunch was the yummy Oxtail Soup, delicious and flavorful. But even on a bad day, salmon is pink and doesn't smell like tuna. So much for the Salmon Croquettes. Mac and Cheese was good, Blackeyed Peas were plain, and the Catfish Sandwich, slivers of breaded and fried catfish piled onto white bread didn't knock any socks off. Verdict - just ok, won't be back."}
{"text":"I really really love the food here, but you have to be willing to deal with the inefficient operation they have in place.  It never fails, if I come in or trying placing an order on the phone, I will wait forever to get my food.  I try to visit during lunch hours, but I don't have an entire hour to wait for the food.  The service is so poor that even though I love the food, I just can't bear being treated like my time is not valued.  Very sad as they could do so much more business and I don't think they even realize how inefficient they are.  For example, they use an iPad to take orders, but no one seems to really know how to use it, as a result they orders aren't correct.  Also, their process for packaging an order requires steps that should have been done as part of prep for the day, then you won't have people waiting an additional 10-15 minutes just to package an order that took 20 minutes to prepare."}
{"text":"Look, this isn't gourmet food. It's soul food. It's meant to comfort. The food served here is done in the same preparation as the owner's momma taught her momma. Generations of love are built into each bite.   When our group arrived, one of the staff members helped guide us through the menu and history of their franchise. We must've stuck out as newbies. This was confirmed when others came in and the ladies behind the counter addressed each of them by name. This is a place that seems to thrive on repeat business.   Through our entire time here, the staff was overly accommodating and friendly. We even compared ethnic differences between the way our family made oxtails and short ribs versus the way they did things. It really was a productive conversation. It was also nice to see them take the time in this hurried world to chat with us. Everything about the hospitality was genuine and warm.   On this night I ordered the fried chicken dinner. Dark meat and three pieces of it. For sides I chose the macaroni and cheese along with the candied yams. Everything seems to be made ahead of time and is sitting in chaffing dishes. The time it takes to prepare your dinner takes no time at all. Everything was great and will most certainly come back to try the rest of the menu. Only next time, I'll make a point to save room for dessert. The sweet potato pie looked divine."}
{"text":"The gate keeper of any food establishment working with the customers should be at a minimum cordial....NOT. I'm a firm believer that if you don't like what you do, do something else, somewhere else, trust, YOU will not be missed.  Nasty attitude is not why I go to Angie's, but boy does it make the difference in the entire experience."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on a Saturday around mid-afternoon. There was a steady stream of customers with four staff members visible, for service. Unfortunately, most of the tables were dirty and un-bussed so I sat at the only empty four top table available after ordering. The empty table I sat at did not feel clean either. The food I ordered arrived later than I had expected for the amount of customers they had. My smothered pork chop dinner included collared greens and rice (with gravy). The pork chops tasted dry and chewy while the sauce it was smothered in was too salty for me. The rice was very bland and the collard greens were just adequate. My dining partner enjoyed her fried catfish sandwich though. She said the fish was well seasoned although her French fries were stone cold and unappetizing. I'm not sure I would return to try their other offerings. The best thing about my meal was their home made Kool Aid! I would recommend that if you were to visit."}
{"text":"Great soul food spot. Catfish sandwich was great, served on fresh & soft slices of wheat bread. Came w/ homemade French fries, which could have been fried longer. Looking forward to stopping back in to try out some of the side dishes."}
{"text":"I loved the food at the original Angie's and was happy to see one open nearby.    I've gone three times (I really wanted this to work!) and tried different dishes. The baked chicken was tough and tasted like yesterdays' chicken warmed over. The gravy is out of a can. The greens the first time were good but a half of cup was $4.00. the second time they were tough and tasteless.  The sweet potatoes were ok but it's hard to mess up a sweet potato. Marconi and cheese was consistently good. The fried chicken pieces are small and not freshly fried.The portions of all dishes are small and the prices too high.    I suspect they cook the food at one of their other restaurants and warm it up at this site.  Small portions, high prices, gravy suspicious for being canned, warmed over food.  I am so disappointed."}
{"text":"This won't become my go to fried chicken place, mostly because the chicken pieces are tiny. That said, I would likely go back to try some of the other dinners thanks to a good experience with the sides and overall good taste.   Good: +Friendly service +Mac and cheese is very, very cheesy. Good enough to order again, even though the noodles were limp. +Crispy fries +Beef tips are quite tender +Greens had good texture +The dressing had a nice meaty flavor to it. I think they make it primarily from corn bread and would personally prefer if it had more regular bread chunks in it to give it a bit more chew.  Bad: -Brown gravy is too salty. I love salty foods. I hardly ever call anything salty, but this gravy was too salty for me. It almost ruined the beef tip experience. -They make a traditional 'home-made' style fried chicken with good flavor, but the chicken pieces are comically small. Rachel asked: \"Is that a normal drumstick or a piece of a wing?\""}
{"text":"Friendly folks serving great soul food.  Had some chicken dumplings with mac and cheese, both hearty and filling.  Portions are very generous and I had more than enough food to last me for two meals.  The only nit picky thing about Angie's is that I wish some of their items were available all the time (like chicken and waffles, etc.)."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. No, I wanted to LOVE this place. But like was even too much for me to muster. When I used to live in Boston, I used to frequent this place on the edge of Boston proper and Roxbury, called Bob, the Chef's. It was awesome. The last time I went, when visiting a few years ago, the place had been sold and become all hipster and trendy. I visited Atlanta a couple of years after that and got some great southern/soul food, and I've found some good places in the DC aarea. But since moving back to Cleveland some years ago, I have contented myself with Hot Sauce William's place. Then I saw something about Angie's and thought, why not?  Why not? Because it wa a great disappointment. The place was easy enough to find, with parking out front on a Sunday afternoon. I have a bum knee so I can take advantage of HP parking.once you get to the entrance, though, somebody like me was taking my life in my hands. There are several steps from the sidewalk level to the entry door, and it's not a friendly stairway. The hand rail is practically pulling out of the wall, and one of the steps is missing a good sized chunk off the front edge. I have a feeling the height of each step may not meet code.  Once you get inside, ordering s a little hectic. I was getting food to go so I decided to try a few different entrees and sides, as well as some desserts.   I ordered the fried pork chops with mashed potatoes, no gravy on the chops. The pork chop was VERY thin and definitely overcooked. Shoe leather? Check. The breading was good, though, and the mashed potatoes and gravy were cafeteria acceptable. The cole slaw was nice, but not special  The braised short ribs snack pack was good. The meat literally fell off the bone, and I liked the sauce. Some may find it too sweet, but I enjoyed it. I got the peppery candied yams as a side and, like the other meals, the dish was accompanied by a cornbread muffin. Again, nothing special but solid!  The last entree I got was an all white meat chicken and dressing dinner, with the ubiquitous corn muffin and white rice. I had requested the gravy on the side. The woman who prepared my serving didn't get the message and when she realized her mistake she was going to make a new one but I told her I'd take it as is.   I got home and opened the styrofoam clamshell container for the chicken and dressing. Judging by the sizes of the two main portions under the gravy, I thought it was a decent meal. But I was wrong. I had mistaken the chicken for the dressing, and vice versa. For $11, including the cornbread, the dressing and one side, I was extremely disappointed -no, confounded- by the tiny piece of chicken that accompanied a gargantuan serving of dressing.  Seriously, I figured maybe there should have been two pieces and they forgot the larger piece (breast), the gravy was okay. In fact it may have been the best thing I got, possibly tied with the cole slaw. The dressing was very disappointing. It didn't seem to be a traditional bread-based dressing (stuffing) so I really had nothing to compare it to. Except maybe a scoop of sand you somehow got in your mouth. It was very gritty and grainy, and not at all enjoyable. To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  Finally, the desserts. After seeing the list of offerings online, I was looking forward to some sweet potato pie and a couple of flavors of cake. They were not selling either of the two cakes I wanted: red velvet  and yellow w/chocolate frosting. So I settled for the neapolitan with chocolate frosting and the German chocolate cake. In addition to a flattened slice of sweet potato pie, I got the individual size whole apple pie. The sweet potato, despite its smushed appearance, was very good. The cakes both looked and tasted like they'd been made two or more days ahead of time. I stuck the apple pie in the freezer so I could enjoy it at a later time. It looks like the best choice out of the bunch.  Overall, I feel I'm being generous with two stars. The pork chops were nearly inedible, the chicken was such a small portion (with so many bones!) the sides were nothing spectacular, the desserts were disappointing, and the one special request I had asked for, the chicken gravy on the side (because I knew I wab't going to eat it that day) was not fulfilled.   Food 1-2 stars Service 2 stars Ambience - there wasn't any Entering/exiting 1star for a dangerous outdoor stairway  Will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Food is great, but if you are on a time schedule, you are out of luck. The \"lead\" cashier lacks drive and the ability to understand technology."}
{"text":"OMG!! Hands down thee BEST soulfood in Cleveland!! I got the fried chicken,mac n cheese & sweet potatoes...every bite was a bite of sheer Heaven!! We did have to wait for my fried chicken, but it was a breast & that takes time to cook properly when made to order!! It was so tender & juicy inside and so nice & crispy outside....the way it should be!! The mac n cheese was absolutely delicious!! I was so happy the chicken & mac n cheese weren't overly seasoned...which can happen a LOT at soul food spots. The sweet potatoes were perfect & NOT canned like most spots try to pass off.  My friends & I all ordered different meals....then we all tried ea others!! Their rib tips & rice were the bomb dignity!! The catfish & fries were the best I have had at a restaurant in over a decade!!  You will not mind the wait for all the deliciousness heading your way at Angie's!!!  I plan on being a regular here & so do my friends I was dining with!!    Let me say the food was so daggone great here that I had to call my mama who was born & raised in the South to tell her how great the food is & where I will grabbing us dinner to go from & bringing it to 2 counties away next time I see her LOL!!   Über Eats now delivers food from Angie's too folks!! Cannot tell you how happy I am that I can order from there on days I have my grandsons & don't wanna drive!!   The only problem I have with Angie's... deciding what I am ordering next visit!! It's a Sophie's Choice kinda decision!!!   Rock On Angie's!!!"}
{"text":"Best if you call your order in first....if not you will be waiting. I ordered 2 chicken wing dinners which took 50 min to prepare. Sauce on the side equaled a 1/2 cup (shot cup) of sauce to sauce maybe one wing. Hopefully the Truck is better...."}
{"text":"I love this place the food is great and it's always fast friendly service. If you want to dine in they have a nice size dining room. The prices are very reasonable they don't charge you 20 dollars for a chicken dinner like some places. My favorite is the fried pork chop dinner with greens and black eyed peas . The pork chops are so tasty, and the greens I don't even use hot sauce which I traditionally do ! So check em out if your in the area , I must mention these jars of cool aid they sell and desserts that really tops off the meal ! Thanks for the great food Angie's!!!!"}
{"text":"The food tast good except for the portion size and the price they charge for a entree their at Angie's would be better if the they would reconsider their pricing and the portion size. Me and my wife tried the the smothered chicken and their was only two pieces of chicken in the meal for 10.00$ it almost made me feel like I was cheated."}
{"text":"I loveeee Angies.  It's a quick and easy opportunity to grab delicious home-cooked food for dinner.    I almost always get something \"smothered\" because their various gravy's are absolutely delicious!  The mac and cheese is hearty and cheddery, the okra is crisp, the potatoes are smooth, I mean, honestly, all the sides are great!    Lastly, I wanted to suggest that everyone try a jar of Kool-Aid.  It's glowing ecto colors radiate from their cooler.  It's a nostalgic way to wash down dinner (and for me at least, you cut it with a LOT of water so it goes a long way!)."}
