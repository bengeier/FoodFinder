{"text":"This is undoubtedly the best Chinese food available in the Madison/Hanover area. I love the Sesame Shrimp, which is not actually on the dinner menu, but they don't blink twice if you ask for it. Sweet and Sour Shrimp (or Pork) also delicious. A number of tasty vegetarian options as well. Surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Delicious and relatively cheap chinese food. Met the owner who was great. Pretty much as good as it gets for good food in Madison, Indiana. The ambience leaves something to be desired, but definitely try the beef and broccoli."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in this area! The restaurant owner is extremely nice to customers. I have been there many times and always enjoyed their service. Their sizzling rice soup is so great that i always order.  Also you can taste that they use very fresh ingredients in their foods (shrimps are big!). If you can speak Chinese or knows Chinese dish name- talk to the owner directly and they may be able to prepare for u. Their Ma Po Tou fu is the best i have had in the country! Also great place to have dinner or lunch after a hike at the Cliffty Fall state park!"}
{"text":"Came here after Regatta and would have rather had Ohio River Waste Water from the Power Plant.  DON'T GO!  Warm food, bugs, dirty glasses...need I say more?"}
{"text":"Potstickers are great. Wontons are hard and bland. The orange chicken was ok and bourbon chicken was ok but the empress chicken was great. Big portions and chicken fried rice is very good. Egg drop soup was not good so pass on it. Service was good for only having one person waiting all the tables."}
{"text":"I've always had attentive service here and very well made dishes.  Love the hot and sour soup and crab Rangoon.  Mains are plenty big enough, usually can't finish on my own.  Just wish the place was busier more regularly."}
{"text":"The absolute best Chinese place in Madison!  They give you big portions and the price is reasonable.  They could probably update the seating a bit, as the chairs are starting to get a bit creaky, but I'm more than willing to deal with a creaky chair for the food!"}
{"text":"For Chinese food this is the best bar none
I have been a customer for 35 years. First the one in Louisville and now this one in Madison 
The food is always great and good portions 
The service is friendly 

I try hot and sour soup at every Chinese restaurant I go to and Empress sets the standard  
My go to is Mongolian beef or Kung pao chicken  but everything I have had is amazing and full of flavor

You will never leave hungry or disappointed"}
{"text":"Very Solid Chinese fair.  I am partial to sesame anything here, especially the beef.   Great egg rolls and wontons.  We order about once or twice a month, usually in a fit of what's for dinner ... 
The owner likes to greet everyone and service is fast.  Carry out orders will ask you how fast rather than suggesting a time.   This is the best on the hilltop!!"}
{"text":"So while this may be the best choice for fake mainland Chinese food, it doesn't mean it's good.  One time my roommate found a cockroach in her food.  They didn't blink an eye, they just replaced the dish.  Never apologized nor comp-ed it.  Just replaced it.  Probably just shoved it off the plate and gave it back to her.  At the very least, comp the meal!
The only reason for the one star?  Because you can't give any less and because they made me pork eggplant.  It's not on the menu but if you ask, they'll make it.  None of it tastes all that great but what do you expect from small-town midwest Chinese restaurant?"}
{"text":"This is by far the best chinese restaurant in Madison and probably the surrounding towns.  The atmosphere is great and the owners are very nice people.  You can order off of the menu or request special dishes.  If they can make it and they have the ingredients, I'm sure they can make it as good as anyone."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in Madison and competes with big city Chinese restaurants.  This is quality delicious Chinese cuisine prepared consistently and properly.  They use fresh ingredients in their dishes with homemade sauces.  They will also adjust the spiciness of the spicy dishes to your request.   
Potstickers are great, the mu shu is the real deal, handmade lo mein noodles, stir fried tofu, sesame chicken are my go to dishes.  Think I'm heading there for lunch now!  They have great lunch dishes with entree, soup, and egg roll!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food ever. Very fresh and top notch. Owner is very friendly and personable. Try the hot and sour soup. I love Chinese food and have tried to find an equal all over the country and have not found any comparison."}
{"text":"Hate to disagree with all of these 4 and 5 star reviews, but I did not have a good experience here.  Maybe they were off their game.  Ordered Sesame chicken which looked to be batter dipped - way too much breading.  The chicken had cartilage and gristle - could not eat several pieces.  Fried rice was nothing special.  A member of our party had tofu Pad Thai - the noodles were big and flat, and the dish greasy.  The wait staff was overwhelmed at 60% capacity and everything was slow - seating, service, payment.  The only thing that I thought was solid was the Wonton soup.  Just not a good experience."}
