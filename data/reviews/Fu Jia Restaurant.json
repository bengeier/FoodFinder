{"text":"Surrounded by 3 other chinese restaurant in a perimeter of less than 10 meters, Fu Jia was courageous enough to open its door late last year. However, unlike the other restaurants that offers a cuisine that has been done time and time again, Fu Jia offer a beautiful and delicious northeast chinese cuisine. Think spice, texture and flavors that are unfortunately not present enough in this area. Yes the place and the sign looks like nothing, but please don't be fooled, take a chance and take a seat, and you will be surprised."}
{"text":"This is a small, clean restaurant. It looks like the cook and waitress might be a couple, so probably family owned. They understand very little English, probably also very little French.  I went there twice. The first time I learned that they had no beer, but I could bring my own. The second time I brought beer, and it was politely opened and a glass provided.  Both times I went, there were other tables with Chinese speaking people enjoying food.  Both times I ordered spicy fish dishes with steamed rice on the side. Both times the fish was fresh and tasty. The food was excellent. I have nothing at all bad to say against it, and will go back a third time, while I'm in Montreal.  Not a fancy place. It's an old style restaurant, and reminds me if places I liked in the 70s and 80s. The food is what makes it worth going."}
{"text":"J'aime! Tr√®s bon! Se sont des vrai repas chinois.   La seule chose que je n'aime pas de cette resto, c'est l'odeur de la friture des repas. Il manque d'aire frais dans cette restaurant."}
{"text":"Very small place. Clean! Owners were very friendly. Spoke broken English. The kitchen sounded like they have the right equipment with hi pressure flame for Wok. Service was fast, food was hot, food was delicious ! A little different from the norm as tibia North Eastern cuisine. Nice change !"}
{"text":"Small new place with some ugly decoration but if you have been looking for authentic North-East Chinese food, this is the place! Plates are not expensive ($8-12, most of them cost $8) and the Yuxiangrousi (????) is amazing."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant specializing in Northeastern Chinese dishes. I really enjoyed these dishes and I think they are authentic."}
{"text":"This place is small and cozy ran by a Chinese couple from Dalian city, Liaoning province. The specialties are Northeastern cuisines. Those features darken color from soy sauce. Among those the popular dishes are stews with chicken&mushroom or pork&pickle cabbage.   There is also a dish called menzi(???, a pan fried semi -transparent cake made from sweet potatoes starch, pan fried with seafood. The cake has no flavour but the thicken sauce covered is tasty, and we simply like the chewy texture of menzi which can be rarely found in any other cuisine. This is a dish from my hometown, and I always order it.  Some other dishes I can recommend is tofu curd with pepper , potato slices, and spicy fish.  Be aware, some dishes may have the same name with the ones from Cantonese restaurant but the taste or presentation may be different. After all, the Chinese cuisines are so deep and wide."}
