{"text":"Green and guacamole salsas were good and pretty hot! Grilled Asada plate was tasty and very good.  Sides were grilled nopales (cactus) calabicitas (squash) Rice n beans for only $10.50 You can't beat it for the price. Loud music and ambience did affect my rating.  I Support local small businesses with good products. Ill go back."}
{"text":"I enjoy and love this restaurant it makes me feel at home. The staff is always very sweet and kind. The food is dynamite. As I write this NOW waiting for the restaurant to open up now!! Give your taste buds a party."}
{"text":"Tacos were good. They give you a green salsa that is hot but delicious! I love spicy food and that salsa itself makes me want to go back! The salsa is an add on so the food doesn't come spicy. Definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"This place is on point. Great service. Great atmosphere. And the tacos are out of this world. Do yourself a favor and stop in. If you're looking for a 3 Star Michelin guidebook, move on. If you're looking for kickass tacos with sides and a drink for under $20, this is your place."}
{"text":"Most excellent Mexican food. Margarita is a little sweet but still great. Chips come with a wide variety of salsa right to your table!"}
{"text":"So, unfortunately I can't write a review on the food because I can't bring myself to enter the building. My family loves Mexican food and would love to support a small locally owned restaurant. I drive by this spot literally 4 times a day, every weekday. 9 times out of 10 there are sketchy tweeker looking folks literally camped out next to the door with chairs...sleeping bags etc. I'm not sure if they are just local squatters or if the owners are helping them out but it has kept us from giving it a try."}
{"text":"This place has the best al pastor tacos! Very aunthenic. The staff is friendly but knowing Spanish will help. Just do yourself a favor and order the tacos."}
{"text":"We ordered through grub hub and could not be more disappointed. The order arrived almost over an hour later (taco, enchilada, burrito and supposed to be two orders of rice and beans). When the my arrived we were missing the extra order along with any utensils to eat it with. We called the restaurant and asked to speak with someone about it and they HUNG UP on us the first time. I called back and a manger with broken English told me I'd have to call grub hub to get a refund. Terrible customer service and cold food upon delivery. I wouldn't even give this place a chance, there are plenty of others of others in the area!"}
{"text":"I went in for a quick bite but that salsa kept me sitting down. Holy smokes, there salsas are FANTASTIC! Be ware, the heat of the salsa slowly creeps up!  I ordered the shredded beef torta which was just ok. I think the beef could of had more flavor but it was very tender. Granted, that's my first torta since I usually stick to tacos and enchiladas. I do want to come back on a taco Tuesday since tacos are only $1! The prices are just insane.   Decor wise it's very simple and nothing fancy. Definition of whole in the wall, but who gives a shit on decor if the food is this good!"}
{"text":"Portions generous...waitress friendly...various salsas delicious...very reasonable prices...but the general flavor of the food was mediocre at best. I ordered a red chile burrito and expected a lil more than what i got. I mos def have an appreciation for the different styles that different restaurants have to offer, BUT...I expected my burrito to be filled mainly with red chile pork/beef and NOT with fillers such as spanish rice complete with diced carrots. At this time also, they are not set to serve beer. Another lil whomp whomp whomp!"}
{"text":"I love pastor tacos ...and heard good things about this place so we went and had to wait 5 min for the cook to finish his phone call...the pastor tacos were so nasty ..they dont marinate the meat at all, its plain pork ..they taste like carnitas tacos ..the asada meat had a aweful taste ,and charged me 2.50 for each mini taco...stay away from this dump ...even my friends said ive never hve wrote on yelp but i need to warn people to stay away....."}
{"text":"Their meat is delicious and the prices are unbeatable! What a random hidden gem in Phoenix. Not far from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport right off the 202! On Monday's & Tuesday's can get $1 tacos!"}
{"text":"Omg!!!! The best tacos al carbon  in Phoenix  I keep  coming back with my family and  the old man master taco  knows what he's doing  the best!! Mr ciro"}
{"text":"This is my go-to taco place. Charcoal roasted meats fantastic! I have eaten here around 7 times now and have never been disappoint. Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Tacos de pastor (marinated pork) so good!! The asada tacos are also tasty. Rice is questionable only because when we came the first time, it was NOT good and we stopped coming. We started up again because they have dollar tacos Mondays and Tuesdays so we decided to try them. Sooo good. But I'm afraid to order the rice again so I don't know. But I think they changed chefs since...  My husband also tried the torta de pastor and liked it. The beans are good. I did try a sope de chile verde which didn't really look like a sope, more like a bigger taco. Lol. It was ok."}
{"text":"This place is strange. If you want food cooked in a parking lot behind a store next to dumpsters then this is your place. Yeah that's right, that's really how it's set up. They are also rude. Don't believe any good review on here, they're either crazy or friends of the owner if they give it a good review. I don't know how they can even pass a health inspection."}
{"text":"We love this place as I stated in my previous review.  However, I finally feel compelled to update because the salsa - so effing face burning hot that it is nearly inedible.  I mean for real.  And I like hot food.  They don't have even one selection that isn't flaming hot.    Otherwise OMG the tacos are amazing."}
{"text":"I wish we lived close to keep coming back. If you are passing through you should stop at Ciros tacos. My boys loved it and the margarita was de-lish!"}
