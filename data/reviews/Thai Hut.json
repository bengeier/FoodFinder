{"text":"Just had lunch at Thai Hut with my fellow co worker who insisted on trying a new place. Got to Thai Hut, menu was pretty simple to choose from.  We got our food pretty quick.  I had the yellow curry chicken. It was mediocre at best. My colleague's Beef panang tasted pretty bland. Chicken was prepared probably in advance as it was not as hot as we had hoped. Prices for downtown is reasonable and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Just eat the drunken noodles and the peanut sauce. Just do it. I love this place, although I do agree that it isn't quite as good as it was a few years ago. It's still the best druken noodles and peanut sauce in my book."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout of Tom kah Kai and spring rolls. Quick service, excellent flavors. Thai hut is family run and the flavors are authentic and rich. Haven't had the chance to dine in yet but if the takeout is any indication, the service and food should be excellent."}
{"text":"The Thai Hut is aptly named; it could definitely fit into a hut.  It is a tiny, homey restaurant with friendly staff and an unobtrusive atmosphere.  I love curries of all kinds, so I was pleased to find their curries delicious.  The red curry is a little more spicy than flavorful, but the green curry has a perfect ratio, and the massaman is absolutely delicious.  Everyone should try it once.  Their edamame, chicken satay and fried dumplings make great appetizers, and the serving size isn't humongous like most restaurants' appetizers.  The scallion pancakes don't come with peanut sauce like most places serve them, but they're still a good choice."}
{"text":"My new favorite Lakewood Thai place! So yummy! Use to go to Thai Kitchen but it has lost something after the change in ownership. The chicken basil is so good. I also got the tofu triangles and they were super fresh and delicious. Service is always super friendly and helpful. I've only ever gotten take out but the place looks quite clean."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Not the physical place, of course--it's a former Sambo's (not Pizza Hut, Clintus M.) with much of the interior sporting the same fake walnut and orange Plexiglas decor from the the 70s.  The fish tank is a nice touch but otherwise the dated decor has only been worsened by the addition of the usual oriental-restaurant-on-a-budget kitsch.  If you're looking for atmosphere, stay away. However, if you're looking for a broad variety of good Thai food cooked to your liking at a very reasonable price, come on in and pull up one of the leatherette bar stools.  Start out with an order of spring rolls (deep fried and served with a slightly sweet sauce) or fresh rolls (shrimp, rice noodles and vegetables wrapped in rice paper and served cold with peanut sauce).   Save room for curry or one of the standard entrees, which are generously portioned and can be cooked to your spiciness preference.  All are made with your choice of chicken, beef, pork, or tofu so carnivores and vegetarians both have a range of options.  The yellow curry is mild yet richly flavored while the Panang curry has more of a bite but none of the harshness than can mar some spicy foods.  I've enjoyed all the entrees that I've sampled but am partial to the stir-fry ginger (shredded ginger sauteed with onions, bell pepper, green onions, and carrots) and the stir-fry eggplant (eggplant with chopped bell pepper, onions, garlic, and fresh basil).  Again, each comes with your choice of meat or tofu.  The chef's special menu has some delightful options as well, including 3-Curry Salmon (just as described) and Ultimate Asparagus (asparagus stir-fried with shrimp, chicken, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, and scallions in a brown garlic sauce). Don't worry about saving room for dessert, though, unless you have a special place in your palate for sweet, thick finishes to your meal.  Better to linger over a second bottle of Thai beer or a glass of sweet Thai iced tea.   I read that some Yelpers have had trouble with the service here, but I have always found it to be at least adequate and often quite friendly.  They've even made sure I was offered something to drink while waiting for takeout and occupying counter space that could have gone to a sit-down diner who would have tipped more.  Maybe I've just been extraordinarily lucky or perhaps my standards are simply different.  In any case, don't come for the service or the decor--come for the food.  Barring that, call in a takeout order and it will be waiting for you within 10 minutes.  Then you can hurry home and enjoy exactly the style and service to which you are accustomed."}
{"text":"Easily here once a week for lunch or grabbing Drunken Noodles to go.  Very large portions and lots of spicy keep me happy.  Usually can split it into two meals so they great service will bring you a to go container."}
{"text":"Atmosphere:  This restaurant is well-lit and tidy.  It's tiny, though (there are only 8 tables or so), which could possibly be an issue during peak hours.  Service:  Staff was knowledgeable about the menu and VERY friendly.  Food arrived promptly and piping hot.  Menu:  As far as Thai food goes, nothing's missing here.  I enjoyed the \"Excited Chicken,\" which is described as \"sauteed tender white meat of chicken with fresh mixed vegetables in spicy sauce.\"  It came with white rice, obviously, and everything was great.  The level of spiciness is noted beside each dish.  Regarding price, lunch is $7ish and dinner is $9ish.  Portions are generous.  Random Fact:  They carry both Pepsi and Coke products.    All in all, I had a great experience here!  Take-out is also an option, which I definitely plan to take advantage of.  Hours: Mon - Sat:  11am-10pm Sunday:  4pm-10pm"}
{"text":"Great food, the seating is a little cramped, but if you're ordering take out it is amazing, best thai spot in lakewood"}
{"text":"Noodles were lumped together. Chicken and pork were over cooked. There were Only three tiny shrimp in the dish and the brown sauce was as sweet as pancake syrup. Very dissappointed in this place. Won't return due to very Bad food."}
{"text":"Overpriced, just mediocre Thai food.  If the plates were 7$ instead of 11$, they'd get 3 stars from me.  I feel like I've had the best of the best in Chicago and in San Francisco, and now I'm a spoiled jerk about Thai food, because I can be.   And this place is unfortunately on the lower rungs.  Too bad too, because its one of the only 3 Thai places in the area."}
{"text":"I just had a great meal here! I had planned to go the Thai Kitchen because of the great reviews there, but it wasn't open until 4 pm. They had just opened at this location in Lakewood on June 1 because they sold their other location which had been vandalized. The restaurant is run by a Thai couple who are from Thailand. According to the owner this is smaller than the other location. The seating area is very clean and there are only about 8 tables.  I had Shrimp Five Nuts which came with Rice and was a very light and tasty dish. Anything with nuts and I'm hooked, I enjoyed the crunch of the nuts very much. This dish was cooked perfectly. For desert the owner told me they didn't have any of the rice or custards ready (They are hiring more help so that shouldn't be an issue in the future), but she said they had some fresh Mango and home aid Coconut Ice Cream. I asked her for a little of each and it really hit the spot. For my drink I had Thai Tea which was great and I believe it had Coconut Milk in it.  Another reviewer stated. \"When I go to these places, the extras count. Service, attitude, decor, little freebies, all make a difference. And Thai Hut rocks on that count.\" Well I can tell you that statement is still true at their new location and can add friendliness to all of those previously stated.  For my Vegetarian and Vegan friends they do have Vegetarian and Vegan friendly meals. The Vegetarian meals are listed on the menu but you must request the Vegan meals since some of the Vegetarian dishes are made with Chicken Stock. Also, all the meals that are spicy are indicated on the menu which I was thankful since I can't eat things that are very spicy.  I definitively would go back to this Restaurant."}
{"text":"rude service and no vegan options. they didn't even try to offer mediocre service. wow. maybe it was just a bad day.. but i'd never bother to go back or suggest the place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is my third business trip to Phoenix in the past year, but I had not yet eaten at any restaurants that wasn't a chain of some sort. I knew that Phoenix had more to offer than chain cuisine, so tonight I decided to look for some Thai options that were fairly close to my downtown hotel.   I had actually noticed Thai Hut on my way in from the airport, but I wasn't sure what to think about it. It appeared to be an old fast food restaurant and while the best Thai is often served from holes-in-the-wall, I decided to hit up Phoenix yelpers for some advice.   Recent reviews seemed more positive than negative, so I jumped in my rental and headed on in.   I was greeted warmly and immediately by one of the staff, and offered a seat at the counter while I looked over the menu. While I was tempted to try something exotic, I opted for Pad Ga Prau with Chicken and an order of \"fresh\" rolls - these are two dishes I typically order up in Portland and the standard by which I judge which Thai restaurants make it into my favorites category.   My takeout came within minutes and the bill came to about $18 which was a couple dollars more than I pay in Portland for the same two dishes, but then I remembered about sales tax.  The fresh rolls were fat and delicious and I liked that they had both shrimp and tofu in them. They also gave me two sauces for them, which was a nice touch. My only (minor) complaint was that the rolls didn't stay together very well and I made a bit of a mess while eating them.   The Pad Ga Prau was made with ground chicken, which I prefer to versions made with the bigger pieces of chicken. It tasted pretty much like a standard interpretation of the dish, nothing mind-blowing, but definitely tasty and definitely worth a repeat visit on my next trip here. A solid Thai place and I imagine, very convenient for anyone who lives or works downtown. Bonus points for being walking distance from the light rail."}
{"text":"Doesn't disappoint. Lunch specials are awesome, entrees are fantastic. We always order extra to take home and their staff is very attentive and friendly to our family."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place while starving and at the office. Nothing is better than finding  a great Thai place and boy have I been blessed in Phoenix.   The \"Pad Cee Eew\" (spelled a million different ways) was good. I choice tofu - lots of little pieces, chopped chinese broccoli, lots of egg...the noodles broke up a little too smal for my liking. It had a great fresh taste, though a few bites were a litle too wok-smokey for my taste. The sauce was good but not as savory and rich as I have found at Pink Pepper and Thai-Rama  - though still very enjoyable. I had crazy insane hunger so went ninja with the chopsticks and ate the entire plate.  My dinner partner had the beef drunken noodles - loads of food and very tasty. The thai tea totaly ruled, the service was great , and other than the odd diner 60's diner feel and homeless folks at the nearby gasstation that might cause some to gasp in horror, the place was great. A total find in \"upper\" downtown!"}
{"text":"This is our Thai standby whenever we go to Phoenix. Good food, prompt service and it's right across from the art museum. The coffee is also good. Particularly like the eggplant dish."}
{"text":"To my surprise, the owner's of Thai Hut are the original owners from Thai Orchid, who came out of retirement to open this little place.  Great food, great prices and a quaint location make for a great meal!"}
{"text":"This place has lots of potential. It's in such a great location and has those nice big windows (bullet holes and all!). It felt like it needed a good cleaning and some sprucing up though. I love the diner counter, so that has to stay.   The food was okay. I ordered Pad See Ew which had very good flavor, but very few noodles. It was mostly chicken and egg with a few noodles thrown in. My husband ordered Pad Thai, mostly because I made him. I'm trying to find the best Pad Thai in Phoenix, but I really wanted the Pad See Ew tonight. It's not the best I've had and I don't think I would order it again. I think next time I'll try one of the curries."}
{"text":"I go here often for lunch, I get Pad Thai or the fried rice or the soup. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was the second time I have been here to pick up some takeout since it's right around the corner, but will never be coming back.  My roommate and I became ill last night about 5 hours after eating here.  This was definitely food poisoning.  We were both up all night sick as heck....  I will spare the details.  We both had to call in sick to work today as well!  I have already filed a complaint with the Board of Health...  Also, check out the picture that someone posted on here of their storage area.  Had I seen that I would never have set foot near this place.  Beware!!!!!"}
{"text":"YES yes yes. Authentic, flavorful, and quaint. In Cleveland's top 5 Thai food restaurants for sure. Endless vegan and GFree selections. Can't go wrong with their green curry."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this place, and I finally decided to try it out.   My Husband and I ordered the Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles, Pineapple Fried Rice, and Pad Ga Pow, (we were on a Thai binge).  The bill came out to $60 bucks.    To start, we didn't even eat in to experience the service, but the take out service was even terrible.  She didn't even hand us the food, she just pointed to the food on the counter and said, \"It's over there.\"  Yes, can you believe that?  I mean I don't even think the the Fedex or UPS guy would appreciate that and they pick up for a living!  Now to the food, it was not good.  The only decent item was the Pineapple fried rice, everything else was too sweet, they didn't balance out the flavors at all.    Thai Hut, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"love this place! the food is consistent, fast, fresh. i live less than 3 minutes away and it's my go-to thai restaurant for take-out. i've tried all the thai places downtown, frankly the others are not good.  i have been to thailand - yes eventually you get sick of eating thai food around day 9 -  this place is spot on for authentic flavors in the downtown area.  i tend to eat like an 80 year old woman - eating the same things over and over again. but i've tried a handful of dishes here: love the curry dishes i've had - yellow, green and red. the tom kha kai soup looks like nothing special but is so tasty. yummy springrolls. the pepper steak, stir-fry eggplant with beef, and of course the old standard - chicken pad thai. delish!   don't let the sketch look of the building deceive you, inside they are kind and have table linens and traditional decor and always fresh roses everywhere! it's usually packed for lunch and dinner for a reason. because i live so close I always go the take-out route and love having left overs for a good feed for a couple of days.   give it a go.  \"thankyoubuhbyyyyyye\""}
{"text":"The worst Thai food. The red curry had a lot grease on top. But the red curry barely had the flavor of red curry. It cost me almost $11 for just the curry which is expensive compared to other restaurant. Not coming back again. I prefer to make the drive to Scottsdale to Lao's Thai for good Thai food."}
{"text":"Went in as a group of eight and a child. Sat us out in front area in dark. Finally turned lights on. First thing you notice is the bullet hole and cracked glass in front. Ordered food and waiter brought 1/2 the drinks. He forgot the others. Food served to 2-3 of us at a time. Others had to wait. Just as we started eating a cockroach (Brown German) ran over my niece's hand.  Killed it and tried to go on with meal. I ordered Pineapple Fried Rice with Shrimp. Shrimp looked great on outside but was raw in the middle. I bit into lukewarm clear gray mush. I will say Spring Rolls were very good. Waiter very unconcerned with issues. I will not be returning"}
{"text":"Mostly I am a fan because Thai Hut is close to where I live - but I do enjoy their food too. I recommend the green curry with tofu.  Thai iced tea is a winner too.  I prefer getting food as take out - I'm not so into the actual location.  The atmosphere just doesn't add much to the experience."}
{"text":"My bf loved the soup (Tom young goong). I got the pad thai the first time, which was good.. even tho I'm not a noodle person.   The second time I got the yellow curry, and everyone on here says it's not spicy enough... um.. it was SO SPICY I couldn't even eat it. I threw almost all of it away. Had an awesome flavor, but I'm not a spice person.  I can barely handle hot fries.   Other than that it was good. Idk wtf ppl on here are b#tching abt..  The thai iced tea was amazing.    I'd go again, bc we live down the street. But I'll ask them for the MOST MILD yellow curry ever. I wish I could have eaten it bc it was soooo goood. Better than papaya thai in Tempe,  which is my fave.  ** edit: got the yellow curry again, but MILD this time. And I was right.... it was BOMB. so of course I order it like every single time I eat here. Which is kinda alot. Lol"}
{"text":"Went  here recently.  I came here once for lunch, and it wasn't memorable, but the dinner was really good.  Enjoyed the Pra-ram, along with some of my friends dishes as well.  The curry is really good, and quite spicy.  The Thai iced coffee was tasty and strong.  Service was friendly.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of good Thai food - this was not one of those times. Without a doubt the worst panang curry I've ever had. What a disappointment. It was a bland, watered down mess. The vegetables were limp and soggy. Not to mention I got carry out and the damn thing leaked all over the place.   Go elsewhere if you are looking for good Thai."}
{"text":"Very small portions and very over priced for mideocer food. My tamarind duck was not what I had expected. I had duck before but, I don't know what it is but does not taste like duck."}
{"text":"Surprised! This is the best ever Thai food in Cleveland area! Strongly recommend it if you also love spicy Thai food!"}
{"text":"Thai iced tea with Tom yum seafood soup Excellent must try if your a seafood lover !   Very nice staff :)"}
{"text":"Went here with the whole family and we saw three roaches running around on the floor and  walls before the appetizers came out. We didn't eat the food and quickly left."}
{"text":"Pad thai was not good.  The soup was fine.  The spring rolls were fine.  I see most people have a good experience, but we did not."}
{"text":"the food is great, I've been eating here for over a year. sadly, they do use a microwave, and I will not be eating here again.  it's not worth the price if they're microwaving food."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood restaurant just down the street from us, we moved here 6 months ago and try to eat at Thai Hut about twice a month.   My wife and I love coming to Thai Hut because not only for the great location right off Central Ave & McDowell, inside an old greasy-spoon diner, but also because they serve delicious Thai food with fresh ingredients at a great price."}
{"text":"I love this place.  My co-workers and I go here at least a couple of times a month for lunch.  The food and service are excellent and you can get out of there for around $10 for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch.  I like the curry dishes and all of the are good.  I can't speak to how great the other choices are. The lunch special is a good price and the quantity is good, but the speed at which the food comes out is WOW fast.  I get food faster here that in a drive thru and it healthy too."}
{"text":"Yes there are new owners - and they got it more than right!  The tastes and heat (if you want it are back). The lunch items are full of authentic flavor, attractive presentation, with fresh ingrediants. The chicken and vegetables are perfectly cooked - and the owner is friendly.  I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Dined-in for dinner this past Saturday (1 week ago) with my wife after reading great reviews.  Small place, 5-6 tables I think, but very pleasant.  A few take-out orders were picked-up while we were there.  There were two other dine-in parties at the time.  Great service from the sole waiter.  Pretty funny how one guy insisted that he wanted \"10 stars\" of spiciness with his dish, then of course his head was being blown off.   The waiter & the kitchen were very accomodating.  The waiter was very patient, bringing his dish back two times with lesser levels of heat.  Obviously, this created waste for the restaurant, but they could not have been nicer about it.  In fact, everyone in the restaurant was getting a laugh from the situation.  We started by splitting an appetizer of a pair of spring rolls (one each).  They were perfect:  thin, transluscent rice wrapper, really fresh vegetables inside, and neatly wrapped with a whole fresh basil leaf showing through the outer layer.  Some kind of clear sauce drizzled on top.  Delicious.  Next, we each had a not-too-big bowl of Tom Ka Gai (sorry if I misspelled).  Killer good.  Finally, my wife had the Pad Thai, and it was very good.  Seems to me it was up to par, but maybe not better than other good Pad Thai I've had.  (Definitely not disappointing.)  I had some kind of chicken dish with \"five nuts\".  The five are peanuts, cashews, pine nuts, macadamia nuts and chestnuts.  Really good.  I decided to have it over the complimentary white rice.  A good move.  What really struck me was how much I enjoyed the chestnuts.  The way they were cooked, they had smooth, creamy centers.  Surprised me how much I liked them, and the entire dish was what you often hope for when you eat out:  unusual but delicious.  The entire meal was very reasonable.  $30-35.  I would certainly go here again.  The 4 to 5 star ratings are justified.  I only rate it conservatively with 4 stars because I have not been to a lot of Thai restaurants in the last 5 years.  But I'm coming here again.  As you might suspect, no alcohol served here, and I don't know if you can BYO."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago we were headed to a play @ the Phoenix Theatre, since it was a bit early we decided to try this place. Unquestionably, I was a little apprehensive thinking that we might be late for the play, in addition I had several other Thai food experiences that weren't to pleasant. However, the waitress took our order and less than 3 or 4 minutes she served our meal. Needless to say, I was totally impressed with my selection the Yellow Curry Chicken meal was fantastic  the rest of my friends and my partner, ordered differently which allowed us to flavor from each meal.  Furthermore, their menu is very extensive and not bad prices for the food portions. The atmosphere and service was very nice, once again if you're expecting The Ritz  Carlton you need to move on, the staff was accommodating to me & to all of my friends . Lastly, since then we have become regular patrons to this establishment, even though there's a bit of miscommunication at times on account of the language, but that's to be expected.  In conclusion, the high quality of the food speaks for  it self."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall, but the food is consistently good and nicely presented. Always one woman serving and one gentleman cooking. You have to go through the kitchen to get to the single bathroom. Seating capacity is 12 people total. They do a lot of takeout. Relaxing music playing"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time to satisfy a pregnancy craving for Pad Thai. I don't know if they forgot to ask how spicy I wanted it or just assumed because I was pregnant I didn't want it spicy but I ended up with a plain lack luster plate of something I can't even call Pad Thai. The noodles were skinnier then regular pad Thai noodles and the taste was quite bland. I am giving it two stars because the waitresses were nice and attentive. But I wouldn't ever return, not for Pad Thai at least."}
{"text":"mmmmm  I love this place.  When I didnt have a tv this was always a destination for some good tube watching/ beer drinking/ thai eating.  It isn't too loud, like some other trendy thai places that play music and have their air conditioning too high.  Also it is authentic, also unlike some trendy places (pf changs/ pei wei etc).  The diner style stmosphere is charming, and you can sit at the bar if youd like.  They also have a huge room, which I have never actually seen used.  I guess one could conceivably hold a large gathering here.    The portions are enourmous, and there are a ton of options.  For some reason, I cant break away from my favorite, vegetarian delight.  the sauce is so good, i always ask for extra.     You will likley leave full.  only downside here is that the lunch isn't as good, way less options, but pretty fast."}
{"text":"Dang dang dang dang dang!  I know Pad Thai is not the most popular dish in Thailand, but it's awfully popular here.  I ordered the pad thai, and my first reaction was that it tasted bland and SALTY. That's  a new one. I poured some of the spring roll dipping sauce over it and spritzed a couple lime wedges, but it was still so boring. I asked for all chicken, and when I opened it up I counted 8 small dry wedges of chicken in the WHOLE dish. The noodles were not too greasy, which was nice, and they looked beautiful. But after picking out the chicken pieces I just couldn't eat it. The aforementioned spring rolls were starchy and tasted like they had been fried in old oil. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"The red curry chicken is delicious!  This is a great lunch spot. It's in an old converted diner, so it has a very unique feel to it. I cozied up to the bar, and was happy to have hot, tasty soup and an egg roll immediately placed in front of me when they brought me a menu. For a drink I ordered an iced tea, which was a flavored brew, not your run-of-the-mill fare often served at quick lunch spots.  The red curry chicken is delicious! Oh, did I already say that? The main course was served extremely promptly, and the entire dish was wonderful. Great cuts of chicken, mouth-watering sauce, fresh vegetables.   I was really impressed with the speed of service, too, which would make this a great spot to hit if you need a great meal in a hurry."}
{"text":"I wanted to take the wife to try some Thai food for the first time and we just happen to be downtown. So I did a quick search on google maps (via iPhone) and found Thai Hut. Now I will admit that from the looks on the outside my first impression was it may not be the best place to take her for her first time. It's literally an old Pizza Hut dine-in restaurant, hence where they probably came up with the name.  But once we got inside those thoughts all went away. The interior was very clean and nicely decorated. The menu was very neat and well organized. Best of all my wife's first impression was good.  We ordered the Spicy Noodles (drunkin noodles), Orange Chicken, and some steamed vegetables for the kids. The food came out very quickly and the plate presentation was excellent. Everything tasted fantastic. My wife actually liked my dish better than her's.  The prices are what you would expect for that type of food and in the central Phoenix area. I will definitely recommend this place if you're a fan of Thai food."}
{"text":"Simply amazing!!! Shrimp pad thai on that pink sauce is to die for.cheap healthy yummy food.btw i order the same dish everytime so that tells u a lot!!!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping for better, stopped in for some quick Pad Thai take out before heading to class at the ASU downtown campus. To be honest, the portion size is just ok, but why this review is only getting 2 stars is because I ordered and paid for extra shrimp... I got a total of 7, I also asked for it to be spicy, its sweet, actually its to sweet and i'm very disapointed over all. I may give it another shot if pei wei is extremly busy otherwise I get what i pay for their."}
{"text":"I got green curry takeout, and it was really mediocre. I'd consider trying it again, but my current favorite Thai place in the area is Banana Blossom."}
{"text":"This place is so strange looking but the food was great. It seems to be a diner that was converted into a Thai place but all the original diner furniture and stuff is still there.  The food was delicious, though, despite the weird setting. I had the drunken noodle lunch special and my friend had the red curry. Both were hot, fresh, and had a wide variety of vegetables which was very nice. The drunken noodles had the perfect amount of seasoning and slightly charred, smoky tasting noodles, while the red curry was bright and the Thai hot really was spicy. Thai iced tea was also nice and a good accompaniment to all the flavors going on in our meal.  I will try it again for sure if I am in the area."}
{"text":"I've been fortunate enough to travel to Thailand twice.  It's a beguiling place.  The most remarkable thing about Thailand is the friendliness of its people.  Everyone smiles in Thailand, regardless of how humble their circumstances may be.  Thai Hut is a sheer delight because it reminds me of the best of Thailand.  The staff at this restaurant is always smiling and their happiness is infectious.    The setting for the restaurant has a fun and funky vibe.  It looks like Flo's Diner was redecorated by Thom Filicia with decor from the Suan Lum Night Bazzar in Bangkok and a Mid-century Modern reproduction house.  The choice of location on McDowell across from the Phoenix Art Museum is great.    Whether or not the food at Thai Hut is authentic is a moot point.  In Thailand I tasted a wide variety of even the most basic dishes such as Tom Kha Kai soup and Larb.  It all depended on the chef and their given preparations and quirks.  What sets the food in Thailand apart from what you will generally find in the US is the level of spice.  The food in Thailand varies in heat intensity from Nuclear Hot to Surface of the Sun Hot.  I've seen Thai folks enthusiastically devour Tom Yum soup that was so hot it made them weep.  I've also tasted a dish spiced with pepper-infused vinegar that was so hot it literally took my breath away along with some taste buds.     With all that said, the food at Thai Hut is great with an appropriate amount of spice for the average Phoenician's palate.  My favorite soup is Tom Kha Kai and the Thai Hut version is luscious due to all the silky coconut milk they use.  It makes a great start to a meal.  The standby Sa-Tay appetizer is delicious as the chicken is spiced with curry before grilling and the peanut sauce is delightfully sweet.  I believe the sauce is enriched with coconut milk.  The Fresh Rolls are also very tasty, but the BF does not like that they include large pieces of green onion in them.  He pulls out the green onion pieces before enjoying his Fresh Rolls and all is good again for us at Thai Hut.  Thai Hut offers a variety of entrees and all have proven to be tasty.  The Cashew Nut dish offers up a mix of sauteed cashews, onions, green peppers and your choice of protein in a savory sauce.  The sauce balances well with the cashews and it brings out their natural sweetness.  The Pineapple Fried Rice is a delicious choice that includes lovely chunks of fresh pineapple and cashews.  The Ultimate Asparagus dish comes from the Chef's Special section of the menu.  It offers fresh asparagus stir-fried with shrimp and chicken in a savory brown garlic sauce.  I totally understand why it's in the Chef's Special section as it's delightful.    The Thai Iced Tea is also appropriately sweet and the milk is a nice respite from the spice in the dishes.  Thai Hut also offers its menu at a very wallet-friendly price point.  I used to enjoy Wild Thaiger, but it has become too expensive for what it is.  Thai Hut offers better food at about half the price.  Thai Hut has knocked Wild Thaiger off as my standard Thai restaurant.  Thai Hut offers take out and we placed a large order of Sa-Tay and Fresh Rolls for our Tacky Tiki Gay Pride Brunch and the proprietors were very accommodating."}
{"text":"I eat Thai food like 3 or 4 days a week.  Thai Hut is a good place if you're looking for a cheap, quick lunch.  There is a good selection of lunch menu items.  Check out the gra pao chicken.  Service is hit or miss.  Definitely not my favorite Thai in town, but it remains a go-to spot for me during weekday lunches."}
{"text":"Almost perfect! 4* b/ I always seem to spend like $20 here on one meal.  My favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix though.  I am 24/7 craving the soup with the cilantro and chicken in it...holy crap, the broth is amazing and it is colorless...but super flavorful. If you like cilantro you have to try it.  Also, I love the restaurant and how it looks like an ex-diner. I hate the fact that at a lot of the booths either you or your guest is forced to look at the atrocious glowing walking couple that is on the East side of the PHX art museum..it is so annoying..so disproportionate... too languid a pace...anyways..    Also, the best dream I have ever had (I know, I know, everyone hates dream stories including myself but this is good) is that I fell asleep inside thai hut during lunch, and they let me sleep..then to top it off sent me home with chicken fried rice..  this place rules!"}
{"text":"It looks like a converted diner.. Bet they improved it from 4 years ago.. Not bad better than a new it was before..  Its okay"}
{"text":"Worst Thai I've ever had in Phoenix. The beef in the Thai beef salad was worse than gnawing on rubber bands. The tom yum soup was on the bland side, and the spicy noodles were slightly mushy from being overlooked. The sticky rice with mangoes was not great but the best of what we had. I was really hoping this love would be good since I just moved in the neighborhood. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"When one is denied gnocchi, one makes do with massuman curry...  THE SCENE: ----------- Mr. K reads on Yelp sometime this pm, \"EVERYONE! PASTA BAR IS OPEN!\"  \"Holy ish!\" he thinks. \"Finally!\"   Mr. K doesn't think any further. He takes action.  * Zing! *  Mr. K shows up downtown in his Batmobile. He is ready. And hungry.  And....walks up to the place next door to Sens which looks like some cool-looking bar/restaurant, but nowhere near ready to open.   Mr. K feels punked (and now pissed at himself that he didn't bother walking further down the hallway, even thought he thought, \"Huh, I wonder what's down the hallway...\")  Never mind pasta now. Mr. K is irate and starving. And decides it's time to finally hit Thai Hut.  Mr. K parks at a far spot on Walgreen's lot (even though he knows he shouldn't) because he needed to head to Burton-Barr after. He marches towards Thai Hut with conviction, but then he walks through the Cancer Survivor sculpture garden and gets distracted, takes out his camera, and lies down on the sidewalk trying to get a good angle at some of the pieces. Patrons within Thai Hut are staring at him, as if he is mad. And maybe he is. Who knows.  20 minutes elapse. Mr. K realizes his stomach is growling. \"Eat, you bastard!\" it says. And so Mr. K puts his cameras away and heads towards Thai Hut and opens the door....  * Boom! *   \"And Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiyaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii will always love youuuuuohhhhhandaiiiiiiiii will always looove youuuuuuuuu...\"  Seriously. That's what Mr.K hears the moment he sets his foot in.   Mr. K observes the scene before him. It is an obvious former diner, as if it was inherited from that 70's sitcom \"Alice\". But now with random Thai bits here and there, including the obligatory \"Thailand\" tourism poster. No pictures of the King and Queen though. Hmm....  Whitney has now disappeared and it's \"Heart & Soul\" by T'Pau Apparently they've got the station on Lite Rock/\"The Quiet Storm\"/Adult Soft Hits or something. I get it.  Friendly hostess seats me at a booth and it's onto the food...  THE FOOD: --------- It's late lunchtime, and there is obvious hunger. But how much is too much for one guy? What the hey. Mr. K was denied pasta. He deserves to be consoled by an appetizer.   \"Chicken satay and beef massuman curry, Thai spicy please.\"  Verdict:  The chicken satay itself was pretty good, but the peanut sauce and the cucumber salad were missing a little something. Mr. K doesn't know what. What's Thai for \"oomph?\" The dish was served nicely, though.  * Break between appetizer and entree blesses the establishment with the sounds of Jon Secada (\"Just Another Day\"), Christopher Cross (\"Arthur's Theme - The Best That You Can Do\"), and then it's onto a CD with some favorite Thai pop hits! *  So...the beef massuman curry. Presented nicely in a bowl and looked appetizing, although the mound of rice just sitting by itself in the middle of a large plate was a tad odd. No worries. Because hunger trumps aesthetics. Unfortunately, the curry didn't have the heat that was expected (Mr. K sad face), but with a bit of dried chili flakes and chopped Thai green chilis, a solution. Yes. The curry was still tasty and very generous in its portion size: the amount of beef, peanuts, potatoes, etc. Mr. K initially thought half of the dish was going to be dinner, but he ate the whole thing,   * As meal ends, CD goes back to radio, for Peter Cetera's \"The Glory of Love\". Mr. K ponders doing The Crane in his booth *  Both dishes together come up to around $19-something with tax. A too-yellow fortune cookie accompanies the bill. Mr. K loves eating fortune cookies but this looks slightly radioactive. Ignore.  SERVICE: -------------- Surprised at all the complaints about bad service. Maybe the Thai Hutters read Yelp, because Mr. K was treated like a Bollywood superstar.   Ok, maybe more like a key grip, but they were still very friendly and efficient.  SO MR. K DIDN'T HAVE PASTABAR.  HOW DOES HE FEEL NOW?: -------------- Pasta shmasta. That can wait. He definitely doesn't feel lunch was squandered. Thai Hut would rank somewhere in the middle of the Thai joints he's been to in Phoenix (and in the immediate vicinity, it was better than Wild Thaiger but a step below Thai Elephant).  WOULD HE EAT THERE AGAIN? -------------------------------------------- Sure. He definitely wouldn't avoid it.  ANYTHING ELSE? ------------------------- Had Thai Hut been just south of I-10, it would be in the perfect location to be the casual late night Thai restaurant so many people have been craving for. Or maybe what Mr. K is craving for. Heck, even at their current location, if they stayed open til midnight (or 2 am on weekends) and enough people knew about it,  they could be doing really well for themselves.   As for Pastabar, Mr. K thanks it for being hidden from plain view and not open at lunch anyway.   For today was the day Whitney gave him a grand entrance, and \"More Than Words\" fluttered in the air as he left.  ***.49"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food. I'm not sure I've had better in the Cleveland area; however, I can't remember the last time I tried another Thai restaurant around here. Oh yeah, Ty Fun. Hmm, it's not as good as Ty Fun, but it's about half the price and you get a ton of food. It's just a different experience.   I've never dined in, just gotten takeout. I am almost always the one and only person in here when I get the food. Like some other \"hole in the wall\" (i.e., authentic) family-owned restaurants, it feels like you're going into someone's home. They look up from their book or crossword puzzle, consider who you are, go to the back to get an already tied-up bag of food, quietly tell you how much it is, and then go back to what they were doing. I have a feeling the service would be a little awkward for dine-in. But takeout is fine, and it's always ready quickly, and it's cheap."}
{"text":"I have been here several times since they first opened.  I have never been overly impressed.   But, this time was really bad. I went early in the day at the beginning of the lunch, so they were not too busy. Food was so so and i never got a refill of hot tea until i had to ask for it.    The worst part was the service. Lots of personnel chatter between the servers.   One of the girls were putting make up on (in the Dinning Room) and another was on her computer.  This is just not what you do in the dinning room of a restaurant.   While ignoring your customers/  There are so many good choices for Thai. I won't be back here. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Definitely go for lunch! They have you in and out in under half hour and offer a delicious soup and spring roll while you wait for your meal.  The Thai iced coffee is the best in town.  The yellow curry is delicious and filling. You may have to roll yourself to your car after lunch.   If you happen to go at dinner time, try the chicken wing appetizer, the sauce is super flavorful and delicious!   This place used to be Mel's Diner or something like that about 4 years ago, I wish they would invest a little to update the decor."}
{"text":"Worst take out experience of my life! Wanted some pad thai, called, ordered it, came in: thats where my nightmare began. The american girl working the front of the house was clearly hired in to help with the language barrier, but she may have had a learning dissability? Not sure, but she was highly under qualified for this position. Our order had not ever been put in with the cooks, I was completely cool with it (even though I was starving when I placed the order, my fault not hers). So I told my friend, it takes 5 minutes to make, its fine. While waiting, we learned that she gave away another customers food to the wrong customer and screwed that up too. Then, we get our food (15 minutes later) only to find out there is no chicken in it (we both ordered chicken and shrimp pad thai, spicy, one with no nuts). So they remake it again (had my food within 5 minutes this time) only to find out, they didn't make it spicy. The idiot forgot to tell them spicy. Now I'm fuming pissed! Just give it to me, I'll take it. An hour later from when I ordered it, I ate my pad thai; it was gross. I've had better at a hibachi restaurant. Barely any chicken, not all shrimp was deveined, equal ratio or rotten bean sprouts to noodles. Ewwww, getting sick again just thinking about it. You would think they told us on the house after all that waiting and mistakes, but no, they made us pay. Clearly I caught them on a really busy, bad day, but to ask for money from an visibly upset patron is just ludacris. I can't deal!"}
{"text":"I passed by this place many times never giving it a chance because it looked like a run-down place taken over by new owners. Boy was I wrong. I've been missing out! This place has great food for the price without question. Never mind the building or decor. The food portions are generous and the food itself is very near authentic cuisine. It's one of those secret places that few people know about. You can waste your money on all the other Thai places that would rather focus on decor or presentation, but if you want real Thai for real value, this is the place to go. On top of all that, the service is great! They're attentive, courteous, knowledgeable about the food, and very friendly. Support local businesses!  Btw, for those that live near the light rail, it's only a short ride away."}
{"text":"I was so happy to hear Thai Hut was open again.  I like to consider myself a connoisseur of tofu pad thai... And I think the one I had last night give Thai Kitchen a run for its money.  It was absolutely delicious.  The place is tiny and it was a quiet night.  Only one other couple was there on a Thursday evening.  I hope their business continues to re-build because the food is SO good, and SO inexpensive.  I grabbed a to-go menu, and definitely plan on ordering some take-out when I have my next craving for pad thai.  I may even get crazy and try something new one of these days.  Maybe."}
{"text":"i used to eat at thai hut for lunch when it was in Mesa on Alma School and Baseline. Now it is in Central PHX in an old diner which is a really wild setting for a thai restaurant.  unfortunately the quality of the food does not seem to have transferred perfectly. the dishes are tasty but they lack something really delightful.  the service is somewhat short and borderline rude at times. i am not sure what the cause is for this but i dont appreciate it. for me eating out is all about the service. so be nice and happy that i am choosing to eat there instead of somewhere else or at home.  the biggest dissapointment was the peanut sauce which looked like gravy from a can and tasted a bit off.  since it is located right next to the phx art museum i will probably be back, but only cause of its proximity."}
{"text":"The tofu or chicken fried rice is a solid lunch and very tasty.  Unlike their neighbor Blue Fin, they don't have their chicken cooking forever on a grill and drying out.  Their tofu has an excellent firmness and is almost chicken-like in texture.  I'm happy they got rid of the minimum charge for credit cards.  I used to barely make it when I ordered a soda too, but I've since given that up.    They have parking out back and are excellent at getting you in and out on your lunch break.  Waitresses are very efficient!  You get used to the converted diner decor after a while, honestly!  They do really need to repair the banquettes (booth seats) properly though!"}
{"text":"My favorite pad see ew!  Drunken noodles rock my world as well."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in Arizona looks like an old Denny's and they kept the breakfast counter but the soup was so good I completely forgot about the weird atmosphere try it you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"The service here is always pretty bad. The service is rude and inattentive on a regular basis, but last night takes the cake.   So last night Mark J and I are cruising around downttown/midtown wondering what is open (and tasty) at 9 PM on a Saturday night. We spy a sign on Thai Hut's door = OPEN TILL 10 PM. Score!  We go in and sit down. A few minutes after we order drinks (and the waiter brings us the wrong drinks, btw) we get news that two more of our friends will be joining us. A waitress approaches us to take our order, but we tell her it will be a few more minutes because we are waiting for two more people to arrive.  The waitress comes back in a few minutes to try to take our order again. We tell her we are still waiting. The waitress comes back and informs us the kitchen is closing in 10 minutes so we have to order soon.  It's 9:22 PM.   Us: \"But we thought you are open till 10PM?\"  Her: \"The kichen closes in 10 minutes.\"  Us: So you really close at 9:30 then?\"  (waitress puts on nervous smile)  Her: (paraphrasing) \"We don't want to rush you, but the asshole behind the counter  - who may or may not be the owner - does not want to earn your business, has no regard for customers and wants you to hurry the fuck up and get out\"  Us: WTF?  She walks away - comes back 60 seconds later, I shit you not  Her: \"The kitchen closes in 5 minutes\"  Me: (in my mind) \"Listen bitch...\"  One of our friends arrives. She brings him a menu and pretty much tells us we MUST order right away.  (paraphase)  All of us: \"peace the F out, biatch.\"  So we left.  It is now 9:30 PM. The waitress lost her tip and Thai Hut lost my desire to ever eat there again.  This sucks."}
{"text":"We were in search of Thai or Chinese on Christmas Eve night, and stopped into Thai Hut.  I actually have been avoiding this place since reading some reviews describing some downright atrocious service as of late.  However, we stopped in at 9.05 (the sign said closed at 9.00) and were told as long as we ordered take-out it was okay.  Now, I've worked long enough in the restaurant industry to feel incredibly guilty about ordering even ten minutes BEFORE the official closing time.  I have been the victim of a (wonderful but demanding ) restaurant owner who stayed open 10, 20, 30 minutes past when you thought you'd be long gone and well on your way towards an evening of lord knows what.  However, about 7 other people came in after us, which made me feel (almost all) better.    We had planned on having a beer at the counter but decided to make it quick.  Our fried rice was delish, though mine was a little bit brown (too much oil???).  At any rate, it tasted fantastic.    Maybe the quality of service depends on who is in charge?  This time it was a very no-nonsense woman."}
{"text":"I've been going here for many years, very solid, a little random Thai place where I've never left unhappy. It's all about the Thai Love - even their rice is lovely."}
{"text":"Went here to order pick up and I was very unhappy with what I ordered. I got the green curry with shrimp what I got was a green cloudy watery bland concoction. It cost $12 and had a total of 4 shrimp with tails... I hate it when the do that. Please excuse me as I pull the rear end off my crustaceans as they are scaly and inedible. The murky green \"sauce\" was very runny and had no flavor. It was also cloudy... reason being... MINUTE RICE. I am not kidding you. I know minute rice when I see it. It's too soft, flavorless, doesn't stick together, and is rectangular instead of coming to a point at the end of the grain. Isn't green curry supposed to be spicy!?!?! It wasn't. This was the worst Thai food I have ever had hands down. I will never order from there again."}
{"text":"So I've been to Thai Hut several times, and have been a fan since day one. I was stuck on the Drunken Noodles with Chicken, but decided to try their Pad Thai one day. Boy am I happy I did, this is my favorite version of the dish I've had so far!  I'm definitely not a Thai food afficianado, but this is the best I've had. The one drawback is you don't get to order the amount of spice you want, like in a more traditional Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm I luv this restaurant and it makes me feel like I'm back in the Bay. The outside doesn't look that inviting but it doesn't matter. The lunch special is a good deal and super quick. I took the vookies to their first thai experience which consist of a 7,9 and a baby and they ate it all up (minus the baby of course). That's telling pretty much cuz that age is all abt a quesadilla. Overall enjoyable quality family outing.   Had the thai coffee (could use more cafe less leche but that's a preference)  Sum brothy vegetarian soup which comes w/the special (good & I add the thai chili collection, ask for chili tray)  Spring rolls (kids loved them, but I'm not a fan I was expecting Vietnamese style equipped w/lettuce,carrots, etc w/a sweet savory dipping sauce but um no so my bad)  Chix pad thai (normally I never order this dish bcus I want to explore the complexities of thai food but I let my dad order. this was so tasty, damn good amount of all the ingredients and flavors)  Shrimp Red Curry (love the mild shuttle spices and creamy coconut w/bamboo & green beans. Trust choice)  Orange chix (for the kiddos. Basic orange chix seemed a lil saucy to me but kids had no complaints)"}
{"text":"The curry here is great and it is one of my favorites when I am on this side of town for lunch. This resturant used to be near Baseline and Alma school where Palee's Crown is now located until they moved to their current location. I have eaten at both locations and it has always been very good.  I order my food hot but not Thai hot and it is always spiced perfectly for my taste."}
{"text":"First off i have to say that today's lunch here was very refreshing was so happy to finally find a Thai Rest that was so friggin good. Almost as good as my beloved Pong Sri In NYC China Town.I've learned over the years that if they can make a simple dish of Phad Thai and Chicken with yellow curry,It's all good with me.So as i ordered the the above mentioned they served a bowl of soup and a spring roll with my order,was very happy with it good flavors and staff was really great.Then it was time for the main dish and i was really impressed with how fast it came out and flavor-full it was.Infact i was so pleased that i ordered a second helping of Phad Thai for late nite noshing.Being from NJ/NY area where food is the King i have to say again that i will be back and others should go here as well.I traveled over 40 miles from Maricopa (Pinal County) to come eat here.There's no such thing as too far to go for a great meal.I've been real disappointed so far with alot of the restaurants we've visited.Adios Amigos"}
{"text":"I had the worst Thai food at this restaurant. The meal was so salty that it was inedible. When I mentioned it to the waitress, she didn't appear to care. She simply asked if I had ordered that meal before--No, but I definitely wouldn't eat there again!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite Thai place in Phoenix. Don't be fooled by the semi-authentic (see: and streamlined) Thai Basil/ Thai Rama chains--- Thai Hut, although not as nice looking as those places, has better food, better prices, and better service. A vast menu of mostly traditional Thai fare-- they lack the weirder stuff you'd find in Thai Town in LA and a lot of the soups and Boat Noodles, but for the most part, Thai Hut gets the job done. My most favorite thing on the menu is surprisingly their spring rolls. They're addicting and we always order two orders at a time. Good pad see ew, and decent pad thai. Great lunch specials and free parking!   My major gripe though: all the Thai places downtown are closed on Sundays. That could never fly here in LA."}
{"text":"Since my first review, I've probably gone to Thai Hut maybe 20 times or so. I was on a real kick for a while there, going once or twice a week, and the shine still has not worn off. I love this place even more.  Their food even made a convert of my girlfriend. She had tried Thai food once and hated it. After dining at Thai Hut, she now suggests we go there, and often.  Since my first visit, I have also dined at Chanpen and Erawan, and they don't hold a candle to Thai Hut. It's still my favorite by miles.  Dammit. Now I'm craving their Pad Kee Mao again!"}
{"text":"Not so much....   I also had green curry, which I have had 200 times at other places.  It did not taste right.  I went there yesterday and I'm still cringing today.   It might just be what I ordered, but Thai places should absolutely be judged by the curry... it's a staple... it's what a lot of people order."}
{"text":"I've been going to Thai Hut at least monthly for nearly 2 years now. I've never eaten inside, we always just go there and pick-up the lunch order to go. I've travelled to Thailand on several occasions and to me this is the more \"authentic-tasting\" Thai food than Thai Elephant (though I like them too). Plus, everyone that works here appears to be THAI. Thai Elephant cooks are usually Mexicans. I'm not saying Mexicans aren't allowed to cook THAI food, but Thai Hut gets the nod for authenticity in my opinion.   The dishes are very good, though can be bland at times. I'm tempted to say that their style of Thai food could be thought of as \"Bangkok-style\" where dishes are usually more bland than say from Isaan or other parts of Thailand, which tend to use more peppers and spices.  The Ginger Chicken & Pepper Steak are my favorite dishes here. The Thai spring rolls are also quite tasty. Staff are generally friendly, but sometimes when the waitresses see us comin' I think they know we are only doing take-out, so no tip for you!  Yes, as others have commented, the previous restaurant in this building was one of those 50-style dinners, but they have a nice assortment of Thai decorations that the atmosphere is pretty cool, though casual."}
{"text":"Our server was very unfriendly and unwelcoming. I felt like I should have apologized for being there.  The food was very sweet ... the soup, spring roll, garden delight ... all too sweet. Nothing was spicy!  Overpriced for the quality of food and service.   I highly recommend you go to Thai Rama on Camelback if you want good Thai food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Yummmmmy! This was really good. I had the fresh spring rolls which tasted great. I just wish that they didn't cut them into pieces. I had the Sizzling beef which had a really good savory taste. I wish I had more room in my tummy for more food. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Thai Hut did not live up to the hype.  Maybe we didn't order properly, but eh.  We went on a Thursday evening, and it was moderately busy.  The waitstaff was prompt and attentive, and the foodservice was quick.  The place has a slightly gungy, dirty feel though.  Just enough to be \"ew\" but not so gross that we had to leave.  It smelled like cleaning solution, which gives me mixed feelings.  I ordered the yellow curry with tofu.  It was weird.  Thai cooks are famous for their ability make tofu spectacular, but that ability was not used in this dish.  The tofu was cut into chunks and added to the sauce - not rocket science, and certainly not a great preparation of tofu.  There were carrots and \"potatos\" in the mix as well.  I call them \"potatos\" because I wasnt sure if they were just undercooked or if they were some other, unidentified vegetable.  I would not order this dish again.  My husband had the spicy fried rice with tofu - it was definitely spicy, the tofu was prepared in the same way, and it had that terrible greasyness that bad fried rice sometimes has.    We also had fried spring rolls.  They were the highlight of the meal - Small, light and crispy, they were really really good.    I don't think that I would go back to Thai Hut.  We have not found our downtown Thai place yet."}
{"text":"A very tiny place with a cozy atmosphere, this has probably the best Thai food on the West side of town.  The dishes are flavorful if not excessively hot; sadly, their Thai Iced Teas (which I adore) tend to be a little on the watery side.  But their curries are rich and tasty, and the variety is decent.  Plus, it's a cheap night out, and the staff are almost always friendly.  We go here a fair amount."}
{"text":"There's not many Thai places in Lakewood, and having lived in Cleveland Heights, we got spoiled by the number of great Asian places there ... But when we feel the need for Thai, this is our first choice.  The Hut's been around for years, but it is currently owned by the former owners of Thai Orchid in Mayfield, which I used to enjoy.  Straight-forward menu, and good value for the price.  The Pad Thai is a little sweeter than some other places, but tasty nonetheless.  In a similar vein, the Pad See U is a little less sweet than some other places (just had some in Chicago last weekend that was surprisingly sweet), but hits the spot.  We also had the Massaman Curry with tofu, which was good, with a little hit of heat at the very end, and the deep fried veggie rolls, which were really good!  It's a small storefront near Birdtown, with a modest dining room, but it's a great take-out option when you're craving some Thai good!"}
{"text":"We had been meaning to go here for years, every time we drove by it was super busy, so we figured this place had to be awesome. When we finally were able to go I was very underwhelmed, in fact I was kinda disappointed. My favorite Thai dish is curry and so my fiancé and I ordered two different kinds of curry so we could share. He said he liked it, I on the other hand thought that the Mussuman curry was too potato-y and not as flavorful as I had hoped, the red curry had a little more flavor but was still lacking, both were too spicy for my tastes. I am used to being asked what level of spice I want but it seemed that that was already chosen for you on the menu. The fried wonton was alright but the Thai iced tea was delicious. I am told that I should have gone for lunch, apparently the prices are better and makes up for the mediocre flavor."}
{"text":"Thai Hut was on my 'to-try' list for sometime now, I was in the neighborhood today so I popped in for lunch.  The restaurant has an odd vibe, it's clean but tired, yet they throw these big plasma TVs on the wall...The menu has a bit of a soup-nazi type of feel to it (NO SUBSTITUTIONS!!  NO TO-GO CUPS FOR POP!! DISHES PREPARED WITH LISTED HEAT LEVEL ONLY!!  YOU BLOW, YOU GO!! okay that last one I made up :) I ordered the lunch special of Pad C U chicken and it was decent, I would have appreciated a little more basil, but overall not too bad.  That and a glass of crappy pine-sol (a.k.a. Diet Pepsi) was just over ten bucks.  And remember kids-the smaller the pepper, the bigger the punch!! I would probably return to Thai Hut if I was in the neighborhood again, I'd like to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"spicy fried rice (my latest favorite) or drunken noodles are to die for."}
{"text":"Never had Thai food before so I can't compare it to anything but the chili duck and Tom yum soup were great. Sauce seemed a little watered down but like I said, not sure if Thai food is always like that."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Hands down best Thai food and restaurant experience we've had in a long time .  Usually, there is one amazing thing on the menu . Not here - so far we have loved everything we have tried . The tea , fire duck entree , the beef salad , chicken kra pow , Thai rolls , and many more !! If you are a Lakewood local , this will be a weekly go to place . The interior is quiet and the staff leave you alone to enjoy the peace . Lastly , the prices are reasonable compared to some Thai and Indian restaurants . We enjoyed our double entree , single app meal with tea for $26. (There was enough food for three )"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some yellow curry and to try somewhere new.   Mom got the pad thai and I got chicken yellow curry.   I wasn't crazy about my mom's pad thai and either was she.   My yellow curry was not what I'm used to. The broth was not creamy, sweet, or coconutty. It was very bland, watered down, and very thin (like a soup). I will say there was ample veggies of all different kinds and we both ended up eating all of our food."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here and I love it. The pad Thai is amazing. I work close by so I will be back."}
{"text":"I have been on a hunt for the best Pad See Ew since I lived in LA. This is AMAZING. A million times better than Thai Kitchen down the road. Thai how it should be done! Plus, really nice staff!"}
{"text":"Yes, the decor is very tacky and there was a filthy fishtank behind me that looked like it needed a good cleaning.  However, it did have a nice hole-in-the-wall ambience in that it was laidback and not busy at all, we were seated immediately and there were only 2 other parties that were there. The tops of the tables/seating areas were clean. It has a pretty typically long menu - I narrowed in on the chicken satay and it was pretty good with a nice dipping sauce. My husband got a curry dish that he liked. So, the food was A-OK, as was the service, but they might want to update their building - both inside and outside, if they want to compete with all the great restaurants in the Central Phoenix area. Especially because they are in a great location right across from the Phoenix Art Museum and adjacent to Giant Coffee. They are excluding possible patrons who might be uncomfortable going inside."}
{"text":"I blindly Yelped a Thai restaurant on my way home and this came up the closest. When I called to order for pick up the man who answered the phone seemed confused and then he proceeded to put me on hold for quite awhile. I just assumed the restaurant was busy. He eventually came back to take my order (pad thai noodle with tofu and sticky rice with mango) just as I was about ready to hang up.  I got to the place about 15 minutes later and to my surprise it was completely empty. Maybe the rush left in the previous 15 minutes before I had arrived? No one there seemed busy at all. One of the employees at the entrance was holding her baby, whilst charging her phone and using it, the cooks were joking around in the back, there was even a guy crouched down on the floor laughing with one of the employees. What?! I paid for my food and left this interesting Thai restaurant/diner looking place.   When I got home, I noticed the food was well packaged and that was the best part. The food was good, but not great. They also added HUGE chunks of chicken to my order, instead of the original tofu I had asked for, but I can't really complain since it was almost closing when I ordered. I hate being, \"that\" customer. The sticky rice was alright too.     Overall, this place was just ok. It's a little overpriced in my opinion and an incredibly interesting experience. Maybe I'll be back, maybe I won't."}
{"text":"If you like to eat garbage and be treated like garbage in a place with the ambiance of a shady locksmith storefront, this is the place for you. Worst Thai place in Lakewood."}
{"text":"I came in today on my lunch ordered a #6. Veggies with rice and peanut sauce. By far this was so gross. I asked if I can get something else and the owner actually told me no and if I wanted something else I would have to pay for both. I was absolutely baffled. She said that if I didn't want it they would have to throw the food away! Yeah duh!  I will never come to this place again. Horrible customer service. I hope this place close down! It's not worth it and a waste of money. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. by the way it's bullet holes on the window and Nats flying! Gross.  I wish I could give this place NO stars. Just dirty"}
{"text":"I guess I have been spoiled by eating at the Thai Kitchen, because their food can not compare; I was not impressed AT ALL. The curry chicken was watered down and lacked any real flavor. Both soups we had were okay, but my husband did not like his; He didn't even finish his food and that's not like him! sorry Thai Hut, you were friendly, but I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"omg this place is so good. I got the Panang Curry which is possibly a perfect dish. My son got the Pad Thai and loved it as well."}
{"text":"Thai food is my latest obsession and I have been on the chase for the best for the past month and a half after eating at Swaddee's in Flagstaff (see my review for that one).  My friend Ayesha (also on Yelp), is a Thai food expert and she recommended this one over some of the others recommended by Yelp.    As a creature of habit, I love to order Pad Won Sen (glass noodles), wherever I go.  I am a sucker for a plate of really great and really tasty PWS.  While, the best to be had is definitely at Swaddee's, I would have to say that Thai Hut's Pad Won Sen is second best.  It has way more flavor than the PWS that I tried at Thai Orchid in Goodyear or 75 Thai in Maryvale."}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant five stars three years ago, especially because I loved the garlic pepper chicken, but since then, the restaurant has gone downhill physically, and now, I'm sad to say, gastronomically. The restaurant had been falling into disrepair for years, but I was willing to put up with it for the food. Today, though, I pulled past three huge potholes into a spot with a puddle of what looked like toxic waste, sat down on a booth seat with two big tears in the upholstery, and was served the worst garlic pepper chicken they've ever presented me with. Instead of their usual work of art with a balance of cabbage, broccoli, carrots, and chicken, I got a pile of overcooked chicken with a little bit of cabbage, a few broccoli florets, and carrots off to the side.  I told the waitress when I got there that they needed to fix their parking lot, but no one ever asked me how the food was. After I paid $38 for lunch for two, when the waitress said \"see you later,\" I wanted to say \"or not.\" I mean, if it's going to be this run down, this expensive, and this bad, I hope they do something to fix it; otherwise, they may as well go out of business."}
{"text":"Warning! Certain dishes are very spicy. I know you're thinking \"well it's because it's thai, man\". Just know that when they ask you if you want it \"Thai hot\" or \"regular hot\" that you answer carefully. I would recommend going with a conservative answer the first time. I'm a fan of habaneros and jalapenos. I like anything spicy. I just went for it. WOW! Kablam! Three things that I've had over there. Pad Thai...pretty good, no spice (of course). Drunken Noodles...freaking awesome, a little spice to them. Hot and sour soup...Don't eat it in front of people who don't know you. You might lose control over your sinuses. I get this for sinus or upper respiratory infections. Everything I've ordered has been good and reasonably priced. Healthy sized portions. Everyone I've gone with left happy. The waitresses are very nice."}
{"text":"Spicy, cheap and friendly!  I ordered the pad thai 8/10 heat and it scolded me...in a very good way."}
{"text":"I didn't like what I ordered due to personal taste (nothing wrong with the food).  I have never had a coconut milk based curry before.  It was fun to try something new, but the green chicken curry is not for me.  I should have stuck with my usual Ginger Chicken.  The bowl of soup and the roll that came with the lunch special were very good.  The Thai Iced Tea had a tea milk orangish flavor to it.  It was weird tasting on its own, but enhanced the flavors of the food and cooled my mouth from the spiciness.  I would not hesitate to return and try something else.  Also, I found the staff very friendly and in general happy people to have customers."}
{"text":"What a surprise this place was! Absolutely beautiful and delicious fresh typhoon :-) very friendly staff very clean little café style restaurant. I usually use them for takeout and have yet to come across one dishthat I have not fallen in love with.  If you love Thai then this is the place for you :-)"}
{"text":"Finally a decent downtown Thai food place with good lunch prices. Actually, the first decent mom and pop restaurant serving an Asian cuisine I've been to downtown.  This place is a godsend from the over-priced likes of Wild Thaiger and Fate. It features really tasty and authentic lunch specials which run 6.95 and come with a small soup and a spring roll. I got a Pad Khing which was absolutely delicious and spicy. It's been a long time since I've had that dish that good.  I also really like the diner experience for a small lunch. The only downer is that if you go with more then four people you will likely be sat in this attached dining room which has an awkward company-sponsored-increase-teamwork-dinner vibe. Although it still has the groovy 70s brown and orange lamps that are throughout the restaurant, which are a highlight fo' sho'.  The thai iced tea rawked my world too. Milkier then usual, but delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious. Probably one of the better Asian restaurants in town. The dishes I've tried have been pretty authentic to what I ate in Chiang Mai. Best yet is the sweet and sour sauce is homemade and not that nasty too sweet red gunk everyplace else has."}
{"text":"THE BEST THAI IN LAKEWOOD! the service is amazing, as well as the food! If you haven't checked it out, go now!"}
{"text":"Don't for get to check out this awesome Thai spot. It has a 50's diner look and feel. The service is super fast and friendly. I didn't see a jukebox, but it would be perfect. Or maybe Karaoke with my pad thai. Tight!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  We eat here every Saturday as long as we are in town.  My husband eats here during the week too!  Weekday lunches are a great deal and quick!  The veggie soup is delicious.  The golden wings - Delicious... chicken satay is good too.  For an entree... we always get Pad Prik King chicken or sometimes shrimp but its always always delicious!  Have been trying to find a thai place with this dish closer to home (east valley) but haven't found one yet!  Service is terrific!  FYI for those of you who just order Pad Thai... it is very sweet here so if you don't like it sweet... order something else.  Other things we've tried that were good... pepper steak - very good - just dont eat a lot of red meat, massamum curry with chicken good... also we order everything medium to thai hot... like very spicy!"}
{"text":"Two for the Hut...I know, Im harsh..Im from the Bay Area...And Pad Thai..with shrimp...should taste like shrimp... I mean, it looked like shrimp...and it was horrid... The noodles were overcooked... the sauce wasnt saucy enough... But a star for effort... I like the soup, whatever it is, thats served prior to ordering, however note..its NOTED that you will be charged if YOU DONT place an order for that soup and fried egg roll IMMEDIATELY placed before you AS SOON as you sit... What if I dont want either??? I also ordered a chicken fried rice... It had a strong taste of coconut, too many onions and once again, overcooked rice... But the staff is nice, prompt... and on their game... So I cant go any lower than 2.. Just not feeling the need to order those two things if I do decide to visit the Hut again..."}
{"text":"I finally tired another dish. The Panag Curry with tofu. It was great too. Rich thick curry crisp veggies and tons of flavor.  One thing I am upset with its the new $1 fee to use a credit card for bills that are less than $10. So get a drink or bring cash..."}
{"text":"The food is great! The ambiance is really nice. I love all the plants, even if some are fact. The spicy is SPICY! It's awesome. Go here, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Little raggedy hut across from the Phx Art Museum /Theater...very clean plus points on that"}
{"text":"Excellent, prompt service and wonderful food!  The massaman curry was a thing of beauty.  Definitely worth a try if you like Thai food.  I will be returning."}
{"text":"This is the absolute WORST Thai food I have -ever- had. I ordered the chicken Pad See U, and it was just a watered-down tasteless mess with barely three scraps of chicken in the whole dish. If this wasn't take-out, I would have asked for something else with flavor or just left without paying. I couldn't even finish it as take-out, it was so appalling. This was an absolutely HORRIBLE bland mess of an excuse for Thai food. Literally choose ANY other Thai restaurant and you'll find better food than here. Absolutely NOT recommended."}
{"text":"Ok... since moving to Phoenix I've been on a desperate search for a moderately priced great Thai restaurant. This isn't it.... the staff was very pleasant, the place was cute and almost diner like, the menu prices were fantasic, however the food was shit. Normally I think it's pretty tough to screw up Thai food, but they managed. I'll continue my search....   Avoid the \"Fresh Rolls\" here.... bad news...."}
{"text":"We've been here for lunch about three times in the last year. Sampled most of their curry dishes and have been pleased. Spring rolls are yummy. Good place to get a quick bite. Not the place I would want to go for my date night dinner since the ambiance is lacking but, not shabby for lunch, take out, or a quick Thai food fix."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never written a review for this place!! This is right in my neighborhood. The servers know what my partner and I like to order and call me the girl who eats too many fresh rolls...i.e. I go here a lot.   Ok. So the food is good. I love this building and the fact that incorporate the cheesy/mocking factor of calling themselves the Thai Hut (set in an old pizza hut type building) is perpetually hilarious to me.   The servers are arguably the best part of this place. There are two women that wait on us consistently. Both are funny, dynamic, and appropriately upbeat (you don't want a server that is too cheery...it's creepy...that's a hard job...they should be just a little bit jaded).   I always order the fresh rolls (usually two orders...and yes I eat them all)...and split an entree with my partner. Of everything I've tried I'd say my top two are the Pra Ram with tofu and the Clay Pot Shrimp both are absolutely delectable.   Word to the wise...the Thai Iced Tea (if you've never had thai iced tea) is SUPER sweet. Like grinding your teeth with pure sugar sweet. It's intense. So be prepared if you order that.   Oh and they should be getting their liquor license in the next month or so if they already haven't."}
{"text":"We originally thought this was a diner of some sort, but when we walked in we quickly realized it was Thai! The employees were friendly and the location was great, being right by the art museum. I had the pad see we, and wasn't thrilled as it had a very different Smokey flavor that took away from the more sweet flavor this dish usually has. The pad Tai however was pretty good.   Atmosphere: 3/10 Food: 6/10 Service: 6/10 Price: 7/10"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends from work and it was not a good experience. The satay and sample apps were OK but the main dishes were all kind of bland. I covered mine in hot sauce and it was still bland.  The service was not good either. The size of the plates did not fit the table and we have to help the server kind of move everything around but it was tough since everything came out at the same time."}
{"text":"We drove in from LA for spring training.  Had a free evening and the old Pizza Hut remake looked interesting.  To our great surprise, we had one of the best Thai meals in a long time.  Once you get inside, you'll forget this used to be an old Pizza Hut and you'll be transported to a bit of Southeast  Asia.  Good food, good service...and the price is great.  I loved the eggplant with beef and the Pad See Yew (spelled differently).  Was going to go again, but they close on Sundays...boo.  Don't know if it's consistently this good, but for our one night in Phoenix, we were pleasantly surprised.  Definitely worth a try if you're looking for good Thai food.  You don't necessarily have to have a lot of heat in your food because they have plenty of dishes for chili-adverse people like me but it's there for those that need the heat.  The food presentation and description will remind you of Chinese cuisine, but the flavors are unique and delicious...and definitely NOT Chinese.  The Thai fried rice is definitely more than a side dish...it's a meal in itself.  Try this place and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We drive past this place all the time, there are always ample people seated on the front window and a Singha sign hangs proudly proclaiming \"Don't worry, we have cold beer to wash that red curry down with\".  The restaurant is undoubtedly set in a 50s style diner which has been overhauled with the appropriate amount of asian-inspired chachkies. The juxtaposition of 50's style polynesian inspired fixtures, a bubbling fish tank and the smell of curry is just like being in Bankok...almost.  Our table for two was promptly seated at twenty to nine, they close early so make this a first stop on your night out in CenPho.  The food was outstanding: Chicken Satay with a delicious peanut sauce, skewered and grilled as one would expect.  The Tom Yum Soup with chicken, fresh mushrooms and an ample amount of fresh lemon-grass was when we knew we had a winner. The broth was tangy and the floating, dried red chilis made a perfect contribution to the flavors.  The Red Chicken Curry with green beans and bell peppers and Pad Thai with Chicken and Shrimp were also outstanding. Portions are generous so beware!  All of this was paired masterfully with a crisp Singha beer or two, the faint taste of fromaldahide only found in Asain beers lets you know you've just had an authentic experience.  That Hut is highly recommended for their authentic food, great tastes and value."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is less than desirable.  Every time I go I feel like the servers just cant wait until you leave.  The servers sit up at the bar and speak to each other in Thai and watch TV which is fine unless you need a refill.  They close after lunch in the middle of the day so call and see what time they open for dinner."}
{"text":"Love the food!! Tom Kha Kai is very good!! We also order Pad Kee Mow & Pad Thai, they're very good too. They just re-opened the bussiness with a new owner & new staff. The service & the price pretty good & reasonable. Nice & clean. Suggest to try!!"}
{"text":"I'd describe this place as a modest but charming American-style diner that serves good Thai food. The owners would probably protest that they've stuck Thailand posters up everywhere to give it a more Thai feel, but I'm not trying to insult them. I got a good vibe as I sat here for lunch with a friend, and it's the same vibe you get at a cozy, urban American diner. What's wrong with that?  Most of the tables are lined up against huge windows that overlook McDowell Street and its downtown Phoenix traffic, which makes things interesting. We were seated at the infamous bullethole window, which also made things interesting. We probably spent some 5 minutes just on discussing those 2 bulletholes. The windows appear to be bullet-proof, because the bullets apparently didn't penetrate them. They just dented them, if you can imagine that. When did they get there? If before Thai Hut bought this location, why didn't they bother removing them? Why does it appear that one bullet was shot from the outside and one from the inside? Does this mean that someone shot into the interior from outside, and someone inside shot back? WTF?  While we pondered the mystery of the bulletholes, our food arrived and we were very pleased. I also forgot to mention that the moment you sit down, at least for lunch, they bring you a free spring roll and cup of soup. What a nice touch."}
{"text":"Placeholder rating. The lady is very nice and the food is great and reasonably priced. Super lucky to live a few blocks away from here. Pad Thai is awesome but Thai Kitchen down the street definitely is overall better and more authentic."}
{"text":"By far, this is the best Thai restaurant. We travel a lot and have eaten Thai in almost every state that we visit. We have eaten Thai in 8 states.  The food is consistent as is the service. We do eat here often and the servers know us and our beverage of choice. Even if it has been a month since we have been there, they know what we want and where we like to sit.  The food is of good quality and is consistently good. We have never gone in there and had a bad meal. We often order the same meals and every single time, they taste the same. That's hard for a restaurant to do, but they pull it off.  The building is not the fanciest building but it is great for people watching as it sits on McDowell next to the Cancer Survivor's Park and it is all windows.  This is another restaurant that as friends and family come to visit from the mid-west, we will be frequenting. It is our favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't let the long, slim, dining room and strange neon signs deter you... Yes, the decor and architecture is a little strange, but the food is so flavorful and the service SO FAST and friendly, you will be so thankful you tried our luck on this unique little place.   Coconut curries are my favorite, and while the prices are not cheap, it is comparable to everything else in the area... especially for the large portions that will easily feed two people or make for great left-overs!"}
{"text":"Indelible pieces of lemongrass/ ginger in soup -1 Heard microwave being used -1 Everything else good!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch the other order extra spicy drunken noodles, the flavor was wonderful and the spice level just right!"}
{"text":"Good fast lunch specials.  Reliable friendly service.  I do wish it was a bit more customized.  i.e. you sit down, everyone gets the eggrolls and soup.  etc etc.  But overral for a fast lunch (not nearly as fancy as Wile Thaiger or even Thai Basil) you can't go wrong.  This is a good casual lunch space for co-workers.  I wouldn't try taking any clients to this place as it still looks like an old diner, complete with vinyl booths for lunch under 8 dollars it's a great place."}
{"text":"I went with my husband for lunch and it was delicious thay have lunch specials for good price and really good service."}
{"text":"Little Thai restaurant in what looks like a reformed diner. News plays on a flatscreen television on the far side of the bar and it wasn't busy at all [I have late lunch so it's to be expected].  I don't know if I've ever seen so many 'rules and regulations' on a menu in my life.. $2.00 for a meat substitution..? My friend ordered the pad thai and paid $2.00 for three 'overcooked and nasty' shrimp.  I ordered the pad thai as well with a tofu substitution. We also got a chicken fried rice to try. The lunch special veggie soup and roll arrived and the roll was tasty but the soup was extremely salty. Our food arrived and we dug in. My pad thai wasn't bad, but it wasn't spicy in the least [I guess I should have ordered it more spicy, my fault] and I prefer a thicker sauce personally. The portion was smaller than pad thai I've ordered from other places but honestly, it worked for me because I don't eat full portions anyways. The fried rice was ...different. Not the typical certainly and I've never had Thai fried rice before. I didn't really like it but I don't know if that is personal taste or the restaurant's fault.   I will say that my stomach started churning after I got home and still is, and the longer I take to write this review, the more sick I feel. Coincidence? I'm not sure.. but I do know I ordered pad thai, not MiraLAX.  Staff is alright, food is alright. I, however, am not alright."}
{"text":"The restaurant appears to be under new ownership. The menu seems smaller and the prices seem higher. The portions seem small for the price. The flavor was great.   On a completely silly note, they no longer do the cool twisty thing with straw wrappers here. I miss my old Thai Hut. I hope they hit their stride soon!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner tonight, which was my second visit, the first being a few months ago for lunch.   Thai Hut is pretty good. I am making a tiny comparison to Thai Elephant based on price and location, but I like different things about both places.  I like the quick service at Thai Hut, even at lunch when it gets busy. The first time, I had the Pad Cee Ew (and completely butchered that spelling, but they don't have an online menu! I tried to find the proper spelling.) It was ok, but a little bland. My friend had the drunken noodles and they were awesome. Tonight I had the Yellow Curry Chicken and it was very good. Also the Thai Iced Teas were decent.   Dinner was a little more pricey than I would have liked (only based on similiar places and portion sizes) but their lunch prices are spot on."}
{"text":"Dirty. Slow and unfriendly service.  Food wasn't bad but I felt sick thinking of how dirty their kitchen might have been based on the restaurant's cleanliness.  Should have gone elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was over the moon excited when I saw crispy pad Thai on the menu....crispy pad Thai is super hard to find outside of Chicago or Boston.   And I have been dreaming of this dish for about 8 years...so Thai Hut had some pretty big shoes to fill due to my lofty expectations.  Sadly, it did not live up to my expectations.  I asked for no egg and it did have egg.  There were barely any bean sprouts, and the few that were present were soggy and cooked, I prefer them fresh and crisp.  There were also no peanuts and I adore peanuts on any pad Thai.  These elements are what differentiates the dish from mee krob (also, dear to my heart).  The portion was  large and the noodles were nicely fried crisp.  However, the sauce didn't evenly coat the noodles and the flavor was not that great.  They also did not ask about my spice level.  Still I give them props that they even have this on their menu.  The Thai iced coffee was really nice, tasty and refreshing.  My water was also refilled frequently.  This place needs a makeover big time.  The ceiling needs replacing and has extensive water stains and damage.  They do have a separate room for parties.  I would prob. come back, but I would prob. try a massaman next time.  2.5 stars overall....."}
{"text":"OMG - another great Thai find in Phoenix!  Thanks to the other Yelp reviews, I've been wanting to try 'Thai Hut' for the last few weeks.  So, when Liz M. and I were deciding where to meet for dinner, I suggested it... I think we were both pretty impressed!  It's centrally located right at 1st street and McDowell and the cutest little diner with amazing service and delicious food... The menu has a variety of options to choose from with lighter fare (fresh rolls, soups, and salads) to more traditional Thai fare (curry dishes, noodle dishes, fried rice, and more) and of course desserts that sound oh so good!  Liz and I started with the fresh rolls (cold hand wrapped and filled with vermicelli noodles, shrimp, tofu, bean sprouts, cucumbers and green onions).  They were served with both a creamy peanut and a tangy sweet sauce for dipping.  I mixed the sauces together and savored every bite... Then we shared the pad thai and the stir fry eggplant.  Instead of adding chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, or tofu to the eggplant dish, we had them add more veggies and it was perfect!  Service was great... our waitress checked on us several times and kept my water glass full at all times.  We were too full for dessert this time.  I guess that's reason enough to return... as if I needed a reason ;)  ****One more thing - Thai Hut offers take out - it even says on the menu that 'phone orders are welcome.'  I'm sure I'll take advantage of that sometime as well!"}
{"text":"Disappointing dinner. We used to go there with the previous Owners but the first time since they changed ownership.. We had the hot pot sour coconut soup (Thom Kha Gai). The soup had no taste and after eating half of it, we found a dead fly into it.  It was disgusting."}
{"text":"Disclosure: I've never dined in, but who cares!  I like Thai food, but I LOVE Great Thai Food.  Guess which kind you'll find at the Thai Hut?  I usually have such a hard time finding a Thai restaurant that makes the food spicy enough.  However, if you ask properly, and are persistent enough you can have your food made at nuclear temperatures.  Trust me, you may blow a thermal crumpler ala Santa's sled in the movie Elf.  Treat yourself, ask for the spring rolls made in the clear rice paper wrapping.  I always forget what it's called but when I order it that way it's always what I want."}
{"text":"Thai Hut falls somewhere in the spectrum of 3 to 4 stars.  I really am not an expert on Thai food and usually count on my gf to order something I'll like, but several things make Thai Hut stand out:  1) Location is ideal and near the art museum in the restaurant dead-zone of McDowell.  Odd, that.  2) Charming building   3) Fantastic, family oriented service  4) Pad Thai is the best I've had in my limited experience (take it FWIW)  5) Thai tea, um, fooking delicious  6) CHEAP  Besides, where else ya gonna go before hitting up the Goyas?"}
{"text":"It has been a hell of a work week and  Friday could not have come any sooner. This week was rough especially with the announcement that we are officially in a recession and the ambiguity was hitting me from all sides. Man, did I need some distraction from all my worries. So the BF (Bacon) and I decided on Thai but wanted to venture out from the norm and we are very glad we did.   The Thai Hut exceeded our expectations. We were a little skeptical at first with so many lackluster reviews but we hit the jackpot on our night. This place has a great vibe! We were seated immediately and staff was beyond courteous and attentive.  We were approached by a few staff members which gave us the feeling of true teamwork.  Our server was attentive and even sparked up some conversation throughout our meal.   We started with a hot pot of Chicken Tom Kha Kai and this soup hit the spot. My worries were vanishing with every spoonful. They say Chicken Soup will cure a cold and that Menudo will feed a hangover. Well, I now believe Tom Kha Kai is the cure for the blues because it sure made me happy! For our main dish we shared the Red Chicken Curry. A little heavy on the red and green peppers but very tasty and was the perfect match with the soup.   So we will definitely  be back and will be sharing this place with some of our closest friends. I've already made lunch plans for next Wednesday."}
{"text":"Ok, my lunch buddy got me to try this place.  It was OK for me.  I ordered the Pad Cee Eew.  The noodles were too soft.  They fell apart before I got to taste them.  Maybe I need to try another dish next time."}
{"text":"We love this place. The food comes out quick and is delicious. Watch out how hot you want it. They can make your food melt your face. The Drunken noodles rule.   It's a great place to eat before watching the Derby Dames play at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum."}
{"text":"We went again last night.  I like the if you go between 3 and 6 pm 2 for 1 beers, hell yes!  Finally had the Pad Thai, it was good, not the best I have ever had (in Thailand) but a good Pad Thai.  Honestly, they put TOO MUCH chicken in it!  But how can anybody complain on something like that?  I can't, I just took it home for the pups, they like spicy food :)  The fried bananas and ice cream dessert is good, I am going to request they put honey on the bananas next time, and I'll BYO just in case they don't have it ;)"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for moderately priced Thai food.  I feel like its a cuisine that lends itself to being done well cheaply, so I'm also interested in seeking it out.  On my last visit to PHX, I fell in love with Thai Hut.  Don't get me wrong, while I've sampled many a Thai restaurant in my day, I'll admit to not having the most sensitive of palates. I want my food cheap, tasty and really spicy.  I want to go one level under your top level of spice and still taste something other than burning.  Here's where TH stuck the landing, which earned it an automatic four out of five.  The topper?  The decor.  OK, maybe just exclusively  the lamps.  I felt like I was in a diner in Blade Runner.  Its exactly the kind of just off futuristic thing that was once contemporary that makes me smile.  We're a resident of PHX, Thai Hut would go near the top of my restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"Might be my new favorite Thai place. Try the crispy pad Thai! Thai tea is super yummy. And the spring rolls!  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I like the Thai Hut because it is safe Thai eating. They have some of the more adventurous authentic Thai, and then they have what I ALWAYS get - The Garden Delight with beef. Just basically vegetables and beef cooked in a marinade. They always have plenty of servers on hand and I've never been disappointed. There's just some little sparkle that it seems to be missing.  I struggled between giving it a 3 or a 4, but I settled on a 3 because they could definitely improve the atmosphere a little bit and parking sucks. They are really close to the light rail now though, just get off at McDowell/Central and walk one block east on McDowell."}
{"text":"What a surprise we had the drunken noodles and we would give this a 10.  Place was clean and the service was excellent.   If your looking for elegant this is not the place, however if your a foodie then this is the place for you.  Very large portions too.  This is right across the street from the Phoenix theatre.  Dinner AND a show"}
{"text":"The service is good but the food.... Mediocre. Thai Lahna is a lot better. All the food is disturbingly sweet. I ordered some curry.... not a bowl of fucking froot loops. I thought Thai was supposed to be spicy?  The food is not authentic. I went once.... and won't be back.  The Green Curry at Pei Wei is better. How sad is that?"}
{"text":"Excellent.  Best red curry I've ever had...and I've tried dozens."}
{"text":"Thai Hut is reopened under new management. The food is quite good, though the service was a little...perplexed? Just took a long time to get things and a bit disorganized. There were lots of interesting-looking items on the menu, enough to pull me out of my curry routine. I am looking forward to exploring the menu."}
{"text":"Service and food here is better than the majority of high end hip restaurants in town. You can usually walk in, order and be out of here in under 30 minutes and the food and pricing is excellent.   Had the the spicy noodles and fried banana for a dessert and was awesome.   Love it every time."}
{"text":"I was quite pleased with my dinner at Thai Hut!  I have had this place on my 'to-do' list for awhile and was pleasantly surprised.  The fact that it is a hut appeals to me for some reason- and the actual decor only adds to it.  I like it, it is ever so endearing!  I look forward to going back and sitting at the silver bar (an inviting spot for someone dining alone).  The water was served with a lime.  I'm a lemon girl, but I can appreciate the change in pace.  I ordered up the pad prik sod with chicken and asked for it to be extra spicy.  It was fantastically spicy- I had to blow my nose several times.  I'm a strong believer in the mantra \"If my nose isn't running, it isn't spicy enough\" so I was quite happy with the intensity.  My friend had the spicy noodles with tofu and was also happy with her meal.  She mentioned that the tofu wasn't as good once it cooled down, but it seems like a tofu issue rather than a preparation issue.  Our server was an adorable little girl who was very attentive.  She was generous with the water refills, which is ideal when your nose is running.  She also helped my indecisive friend out by offering up a list of the more popular dishes.    I have no real complaints.  I'll be back, you little hut, you!"}
{"text":"Just had the chicken panang. I will say I was craving a good thai meal but even as hungry as I was and ready for Thai, the food was OK. The sauce was flavorful but thin and watery. The vegetables were tasty but the chicken was some what tough. Let's face it though...I will go back because there aren't that many choices in town and it was good enough to finish. The portion size was just right I thought."}
{"text":"It's a great start when you know Thai people are running a Thai restaurant. Every dish I have had so far is on point and tastes great, and even addicting to some extent. I cannot stop ordering the beef noodle soup during lunch time. Some inconsistencies in the beef and noodle portion but it's soo good I can't help myself. Their noodle dishes are also well made, with a generous portion of meat unless most other places where you get a plate of noodles with a minimal serving of protein. I will be trying out more items during my lunchtime. Parking is ample, which is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"This place is gem behind the Central Phoenix library and next to Walgreens. They have great lunch specials that are worth a visit. My favorite dish so far is the spicy noodles. The noodles were flavorful and pretty darn spicy, just how they should be. If you're in the mood for some authentic Thai food, you gotta give this place a try."}
{"text":"Outdated interior and plastic seats, but this is my favorite Thai food in PHX. Seems like it may be family owned and service is good. Fairly priced and good central location."}
{"text":"i did a double dip at thai hut in one week. i couldn't help myself. extremely generous portions (enough for two people) at reasonable prices, fast, efficient service, and just enough tacky asian feel to suck me in.  the coconut curry chicken was amazing. not too sweet either (as it can be made). came with a large plate of rice. pad ped with chicken could have be a notch spicier (ask for thai hot when you order so you can feel your intestines burn) but the red curry paste it came in was extremely tasty. this also came with rice.  my next visit (to go, ready in just 10 minutes) was an order of their spicy fried rice with chicken. it came with sliced peppers (hold the onions) and was just spicy enough for me. delicious.  best thai food in phoenix."}
{"text":"Sadly, the food was just okay.  I asked for not spicy and it came out spicy.  Soup was bland.  They charge for extra rice -- really a turnoff.  Outdated and worn out store. They must have an air conditioning problem because there were floor fans everywhere and they didn't look temporary.  A plethora of negative signs:  \"Bathrooms only for patrons.\" \"If you don't order an entree you still have to pay for the (small) egg roll and (boring) soup.\"  \"We can refuse service to anyone.\"  Makes me question their wisdom for having a restaurant in this part of town.   I live down the street so I am not knocking the area just wondering why they are here if they have to post offensive signs."}
{"text":"We call this place \"Thai Denny's\" because it's housed in what looks like a cheap-o diner from the 70's.  It's quaint and sitting next to the street gives you a nice view of the interesting folks walking along McDowell and the incessant Phx Art Museum display of the people walking on forever.  Anyway, I'm giving this place five stars...NOT because it's the best Thai food I've ever had, but because this place is CONSISTENTLY good, no matter what I order.  And it's relatively cheap...the lunch specials are cheap, but yet the portions are large.  The dinner's are pretty cheap too.  The waitstaff is constantly filling up our water glasses...we joke and say they're \"water ninjas\" because sometimes our water glasses get filled without us even knowing how...they're THAT good.  All the curries here rock, the pad thai is great, the Tom Yum soup is good.  No matter what we order, it comes out in light-speed timing, it's tasty, and we're happy."}
{"text":"i love asian food- i also love spicy food and decent portions and thai hut gives me all of that.  the service is excellent and the drunken noodles with tofu are amazing. i get it thai hot and it is plenty spicy! i've also had their green curry, which was excellent. there are a few places in tempe that i like better, but it's the best in central phoenix, imo"}
{"text":"Drunken noodles were delish. Loved the lunch special that comes with a free soup and roll. The Thai iced tea was a bit overwhelming with delicious flavor, I had to water it down, but if you love sweet you'll love it full flavor. Lunch time prices were pretty reasonable and service wasn't as friendly as one would want but they were on point. I'll will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Picked up takeout after work for dinner. The tofu pad Thai was amazing! I especially liked the amount of crushed peanuts on my dish an the way the tofu was prepared. My only complaint was that the dipping sauce for the vegetable spring rolls was a big vinegary"}
{"text":"Probably one of the most underrated establishments in Phoenix. They have the best green curry and drunken noodles, hands down!!! Soups are awesome, prices are awesome, service is awesome.: the only thing that kind of is sad is that they are not open on Sunday!! Bad for me, but good for them!! Everybody needs a little rest some times!!    More often than not we order pick up from here-- but it is usually ready in 15min and is not a sacrifice of quality vs in restaurant dining!! A+++!!!"}
{"text":"I've only been once to the Thai Hut, and it was after the Museum visit, as it's right across the street. Combine two cranky parents and two tired kids and it could have been an unpleasant dinner. But Thai Hut servers were very accomodating, the food was delicious and they were friendly about my kids checking out the fish and stuff... I'd go back again, for sure."}
{"text":"Food portions were gigantic and flavorless. Service was absolutely despicable. The server was sitting there texting on her phone, charging me 3 dollars for hot water and a tea-bag, and I was just sitting there, staring out the bullet holes in the glass windows, wishing I could have gone to Wild Thaiger."}
{"text":"I LOVE YOU THAI HUT!!! :)  i must admit, yesterday was sunday and you were closed  so i cheated on you with the thai elephant.  i now realize that even though it was delicious and fun, YOU are the only one who can satisfy my red curry needs. will you please forgive me?? TLA Riana  p.s if you start opening on sunday i promise to make it worth your while."}
{"text":"It was ok but I've had better I guess everyone cooks it different... The servings wasn't that big for what I paid but I'd try it again"}
{"text":"Terrible pad Thai. We got the chicken and veggie pad Thai to go - no one was in there when we picked up the food and I can understand why. Chicken was chewy and hard - Veggies were soggy and the flavoring was awful - almost had a fish taste to it.  I barely took down a few bites before throwing it all out"}
{"text":"This place is great!  The food is very tasty.  The prices are low and the staff is really nice.  I really enjoy going there for lunch because they serve you a spring roll and soup as soon as you walk in.    They have the best spring rolls I've ever had!  Their dinner menu has a lot of good dishes to choose from.    I also liked that it is set in a diner atmosphere."}
{"text":"I come here often and it's always good food and the family that run it are very nice. I started coming here a few months ago when it rained really hard and I needed a refuge. Since then, I stop by to eat during lunch and sometimes after work."}
{"text":"Okay just letting anyone know there is pei wei not even half a mile down the street. I can only judge the pad tai but I am not a fan at all . it tasted like just noodles if I'm being honest and compared to a pei wei, you are better off paying a lower price and getting a better attempt. The chicken was a little chewy , the sauce was very minimum and even the shrimp needed to be cook in sauce. Hey but noodles were cooked fine. The place looks cool diner setting and the people working there are nice but man , I can not recommend their food. At least off the pad tai. Other items on their menu may be better."}
{"text":"Things taste different closer to closing time.  Especially when you decide to mop floors with heavy pine scented de-greaser.  I can never look at green curry the same thanks to the resin flavored background competition that wharfed my senses on this visit.  I hasve to admit, it started out promising as the tom yum soup was delivered promptly and heated and with bowls to share with others.  Some translation issues existed and may explain why my thai tea arrived as a dessert tea versus fresh iced tea.  Another matter of interpretation is the meaning of a cup versus a bowl of soup.  A small negotiation was made to include some cashews in the meal choice of my friend who thought they'd go lovely with beef and broccoli.   The agreement hiked the price up a bit but in the end he was satisfied with the food.  I did like the fact that we were given water and it was refilled often and there seemed to be a decide"}
{"text":"DON'T TRY TO USE YOUR COUPON HERE. We were dying for Thai food and found this restaurant [that we had never heard of before] in the Entertainment Book. We read the positive reviews and drove all the way over there to find out they do not honor their coupon. Maybe they think they are getting free advertising by having their restaurant in the book so people will check them out and stay anyway, but we did not because of the principle. The place was empty except for two employees sitting at a table. I guess they did not want our business and now have lost it in the future as well, because of their false advertising."}
{"text":"I've gone back since and tried the hot and spicy noodles and think they're great, much better than the curry I tried. I've had the pad thai and they make it way too sweet. They need to learn subtlety with the coconut milk. I'm staying at 2 stars. The food is not bad, but it's certainly not even close to my favorite Thai restaurant in the valley."}
{"text":"I love Thai Hut! My favorite Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"9/22/10  Finally ventured away from green curry today and tried two new (to me!) dishes: #57 Egg Noodle Soup BBQ Pork ($9.95) and #36 Stir-fry Eggplant ($9.95).  Since I was planning on taking most of the noodle soup home, I didn't want the noodles to thicken up from the broth, so I asked for the soup entree to be \"dry.\"  When the dish arrived w/ a little broth, I initially was disappointed.  That is, until I tried the broth!  What was I thinking?  The broth tasted so good!  I also loved the bbq pork w/ the egg noodles.  I loved the combo so much, I finished the entire serving!  I'm definitely going to order this one the next time I visit!  :)  The stir-fried eggplant entree was also very tasty.  My only complaint is that it was very greasy.  OK, I did have a second complaint-- why can't I order this dish w/ an accompaniment of egg noodles instead of rice?  I CAN'T eat rice!  I even told them to charge me for it, in case it was a question of substitution (which some places frown upon), but I wasn't given that option, either :(  Oh well... I decided I'd sulk a bit and then reward myself w/ some coconut ice cream.  While their ice cream still tasted good, my stomach can't take it anymore... Wonder if they've changed the recipe?  Today wasn't the first time I couldn't keep it down.  Too greasy, I think."}
{"text":"Well, well well.  If it isn't Thai Hut. So, Thai Hut, you're feeling your oats.  Maybe your starting to make some money? Getting those bills paid? Your ends are meeting pretty well these days?  I noticed you don't need homeless sign twirlers any more. Nice. Where did they go?  Well since things are going well, you should start shitting on the very people that you rely on, your customers.  Sorry folks. When Yelpers hang out together you get multiple reviews of the same experience.  Here is my version, albeit filtered through my own version of life called Mark-O-Vision.   So, Jenn H. and I are kicking it old school.  You know collars popped, pants pegged,  and my Cubbies hat cocked all sideways and shit.  Like 90210 meets Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo.    At first we were going to go to IHOP to get our french toast on.  We pulled up to IHOP and noticed that the recent tornado that had ripped through Phoenix had rendered any and all hopes of getting an internationally inspired breakfast meal moot.  Will nobody come to Phoenix's aid and help these poor desert dwellers out?  \"George Bush hates pancakes!\"  So we decided on the next best thing open a little after 9pm at night, Thai Hut.  When we pulled up we were even a little worried that we were to late, but the sign said 10pm.  Score! (Ah, how cute.  Jenn and I wrote the same thing about how late they are open. Score indeed.)  So we sit and order drinks.  I wanted water and an Ice Tea.  What I got was a water and a Thai Ice Tea.  Nice up-sale!  Oh well, it comes with a cute little straw hat thingy so I spend the next few minutes turning it into a little snake and forgot the mishap.  Then we are told that we have ten minutes to place our order.  What? What? Why? The sign says.... For a full and mostly accurate transcription on the dialogue see Jenn H's review. I think she left out a lot of the \"Boiy'z\", \"Dooodes\", \"Bro-dawgs\", \"For Shiz's\",  and Samuel Jackson quotes that we constantly pepper our conversions with.  But, you can just add any one of the aforementioned on to any of the lines of dialogue she used to get a really accurate feel for the conversion. For example: Us: \"But we thought you are open till 10PM, Bro-Dawg?\"  So to make a short story longer.  We were either forced to order right then and there even though we still had at least thirty minutes left until the posted closing time or leave.   So we left.  WE felt completely rushed and unappreciated.  Why would someone turn away business?  I could understand if we showed up late or even if we had Andy Dick with us.  But just throwing us out because you all wanted to get home a little early and, I don't know, play Jenga makes no sense.  It wasn't like the place was empty either.  There was a dude that looked just like Jason Mewes at the very next table yucking it up with his head banging wife/woman.  When we told the lady that we were leaving she looked at us and said \"No, problem.\"  Not in a cute Jamaican t-shirt kind of way, but in a snarky \"oh, thank god\" kind of way.  Doodes! That is horseshit.  Why even post your hours if you are not going to at least pretend to keep those hours? I even had to pay for the Thai Iced Tea I did not order.  It is going to take a head wound induced bought of amnesia in order to get me to come back to this place."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for mom and pop places and this is one of them. Quaint setting with knick knacks from Thailand. The woman who cooks is so nice. The meals hit the spot when you have a Thai craving, particularly the Thai ice tea, that's like crack in liquid form. The ingredients are always fresh and she finally put on some music. It's a hidden gem in Lakewood."}
{"text":"This place is good. Nothing about it really stands out (well, if you're really picky about how a place looks it's pretty run down), but the food is fine.   I like Thai food, but I'm also pretty easy to please with it. I came here with two friends and we ordered Pad Thai, a fried rice (I forget which one), and a curry (I can't remember which one, but it was similar to a Panang). We also started with some fresh rolls. This is probably a pretty basic selection of Thai food, and like I said, it all tasted good. None of it stood out as the \"best\" (or \"worst\" for that matter) Thai food I've ever had.   The restaurant was empty when we came (I was surprised because it was about 7 o'clock on First Fridays). Our waitress was friendly, but a little slow. However, once we ordered our meal the food came super fast.   They serve beer and wine only here as far as alcohol goes. We were gonna order a bottle of wine to split amongst the three of us. They don't have a whole lot of choices (and you wouldn't expect a place like this to), and it's mostly really cheap stuff that you wouldn't normally expect to see on a menu to order by the bottle at a restaurant, but the waitress informed us they were out of a few wines, so we got beer instead. Again, not a lot of choices, and it's mostly the cheap stuff, but they do offer two Thai beers, which we tried. I had one that tasted similar Asahi. It was fine.   This place is definitely a little run down (and quite honestly, not the cleanest looking place...but not disgustingly dirty). It looks like it used to be an old-timey diner.  I would come back here if someone suggested it, but I know there's other Thai places downtown that I would like to try first. I will say, the prices here are very reasonable. Most dishes are about ten dollars, and they're good sized portions."}
{"text":"I just love this place!  The food is tasty and very reasonably priced and the service is always fast and very friendly :-)"}
{"text":"I'm officially addicted to Thai Hut!  House fried rice or Basil Chicken fried rice is awesome! 2 pepper icons on the menu is exactly what it should be: nice and spicy but not overwhelming.  I've been going in there a couple times a week.  Really nice lady cooking, and I usually don't even call ahead and I have my food in 5-10 min.  Try it!"}
{"text":"After a long day at the Rally downtown this weekend we decided to try something new for dinner.  The group I was with are all fans of Thai and we all have said we wanted to try Thai Hut because it was a new local business in the heartbeat of downtown.  It is a little strange that it looks like it used to be a dinner and it could have been a little more clean however.... The food was very good.  I had the traditional Pad Thai.  It was very tasty and seasoned just right.  We also tried the spring rolls and they were very good as well.   My friend said something that made me curious.  He said that his orange chicken was the best he has ever had.  Now I know my orange chicken so even though I didn't try his I  will get it next time I go.    If you are in the downtown area and looking for good Thai food check it out.  Like I said its not the most glamorous place, but it does represent good Thai food."}
{"text":"Incredible. This place is perfect family owned very authentic. The man cooks while the wife serves. The food is amazing and you can bring your own booze!!"}
{"text":"I've liked Thai Hut since I found it. Though I can't rate all the menu items, I absolutely love the spring rolls and there homemade sweet and sour sauce. Yes, they make there own and one of the few places in Phoenix that doesn't serve that nasty bright pink stuff most places have. It also can be a bit on the spicy side, it varies a bit every time I've gone.  A real good dish (can't remember the name of it exactly) I think is pag ga pow (the only thing I ever order besides the rolls). Its finely chopped chicken with garlic and basil, also when I went there with a group, though everyone stated they liked there dish they all tried a sample of mine and kept on sampling till I had to defend my meal with a fork."}
{"text":"Okay, eating Thai food in what seems to be an old diner is kinda weird.  But after getting off of long flights, my mother and I needed some kind of Asian food and quick.  The GPS was taking us to a sushi joint when we drove by this place and we immediately switched gears.  I give these guys major kudos for the portion size.  Seriously, I felt like I was still in Texas with such an enormous plate full of pad thai sitting in front of me.  And it was delicious--plenty of peanuts, the noodles were perfectly cooked, and they didn't skimp on the meat.  My mom's soup had to be improvised since they'd run out of octopus.  They asked her if she wanted to change her order or just double up on the shrimp and she chose the latter.  Sure, it was tasty, but she was really disappointed.  The fried spring rolls were okay, but they were tiny and not piping hot.  This was a nice way for us to start our trip and the food hit the spot.  It came out quickly and the service was quite friendly (though not quite professional).  I'm all about supporting the mom-and-pop shops and when the kids are working for the parents, I feel for them even more (been there, done that).  With a better parking lot and some remodeling to get rid of the weird diner feel, this place will continue to attract more and more clients."}
{"text":"Thai hut is a nothing-special Thai restaurant.  The weirdness of the dine-in experience we had the other night will guarantee that if we do go back, it will be for take-out only.  It wasn't unfriendly, it wasn't bad service, it was just.....uncomfortable. The feeling during our meal was kind of like being an awkward teenager in a room full of unfamiliar people. It was eerily quiet - put some music on please! And it was quite small so although the server was quite nice and competent, it was as if she was hearing our every word and watching our every fork-full. Awkward.  The food was pretty good, but nothing spectacular.  I had the Pad Thai and Sean had the Thai Hut Combo which has mango, beef, tofu and veggies. Pad Thai was 3-star, combo 4-star. The noodle dishes at Minh-Anh in Gordon Square are far better. If you are in the mood for Thai and want something quick in Lakewood, this is a good option but I highly recommend take-out."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I love supporting local businesses, but we were underwhelmed by our first carryout order experience here.  My husband had chicken pad Thai, which he said was good but nothing special. I had vegan pad Thai (an extra 75 cents) with extra vegetables ($1) that was not good at all - I paid to have extra veggies and there were seriously like 4 broccoli spears in my dish. I can't imagine what a normal serving of vegetables would have looked like. We also ordered veggie spring rolls, which tasted like spring rolls we have had elsewhere - good, nothing amazing.  We are going to try this restaurant one more time to sample something other than Pad Thai. Will post an updated review when we do."}
{"text":"I have to be honest; I found Thai Hut average at BEST. I may not be an expert, but Thai is my favorite food (I eat it at least once a week) and I recently spent 10 days in Thailand, so I have had my fair share and I certainly know a good meal when one is put in front of me... and no such thing happened here at Thai Hut.   My food and my hot tea were lukewarm-bordering-on-cold, the flavor in the Tom Kah soup was minimal and completely overpowered by the chili flakes they put on the top (fist time I have ever seen that) and the yellow curry, while traditional, left a lot to be desired in both the taste and the consistency (very soupy).  The service was okay, but certainly not friendly. I actually even felt uncomfortable at times.  With all the other Thai places in the area (Thai Elephant, Wild Thaiger, Thai Basil) I have no reason to make it back to Thai Hut.   Sowwweeee!"}
{"text":"Garnish?    Yes, Garnish!!!  Seriously, when was the last time you had a lunch for $7 with a carrot flower and carrot \"shoestrings\" on the side of your plate?      The food is good, sure it might not be the best in the world, but it's very good for Thai .  Service is quick and attentive so it's a great place for lunch.  Large and filling portions. A simple yet comprehensive lunch menu.  I thought the Hut part of \"Thai Hut\" always seemed kind of dumb but once you come here it makes sense.  It's the original diner on the inside which makes it feel comfortable and  inviting.  The big picture windows and fun to look out on McDowell and check out the passers by"}
{"text":"Nice place. I had level 8 it was hot and spicy I feel great after it I recommend this place. Most def"}
{"text":"I am glad this place is now in my neighborhood, it is great to have Thai food so close to downtown. The restaurant is a former greasy spoon American style diner, complete with a counter and booths, the kind of place you would picture Mel and Flo. The food is really good, not the best Thai food I have ever had, but still really good. And the prices aren't bad, either. The staff is friendly and helpful and, of course, almost all Thai. They seem genuinely happy to have you visit and have your business. The serve a great Tom Yum soup. The menu has traditional Thai dishes as well as some Chinese and like most Thai restaurants you can choose your meat or tofu. The place is great. Give it a try."}
{"text":"The immediate surroundings are creepy, but the food is good and quick, so when we're running short of time before going to theater this is a good choice. In my case, usually the food is either too spicy or not spicy enough, but no one else I've gone with has had that problem. I pretty much stick to the tofu curries."}
{"text":"It's okay, but there certainly is better Thai available in the area.  Had the drunken noodles and masaman curry. Noodles where bland and gummy and needed a healthy dose of Sirracha. Curry was just okay but they screwed up the order (ordered only veg, came with chicken and tofu). To top it off the service was super slow and spotty. The place was busy though so maybe I didn't order the right stuff."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I pass it on my way to work every day, and finally I had a chance to try it out after months of intending to.   The good: There were only two people working, but they handled a large lunch rush pretty efficiently. I like it that they bring out a complimentary spring roll and soup while you wait for them to take your order. The food came out pretty quickly considering the crowd, and they took my money at the end with no undue delay--maybe a little too fast as I discuss below.  The bad: The food was bland. I assume it was catering to American tastes, but when I asked for it to be spiced up (which the menu indicated was an option), I was told that they would give me peppers on the side. Service was not friendly, but not exactly unfriendly either. They could have benefited from one or two extra servers. They also seemed like they were in a big hurry for us to leave, though the crowd was thinning by the time we were done. I'll cut them slack on this one, since it was lunch and I am sure most people are in a hurry.   My wife and shared the Thai Hut Chicken Noodles and Pad Thai. The former tasted eerily of Campbell's Chicken and Noodle soup with some of the broth removed, while the latter was no better than the ready-to-eat version that they sell at Fresh and Easy. I'm spoiled living where I do in Tempe, so close to about a dozen really good Thai places, so your mileage may vary.   I like the diner-like appearance of the place. It's almost like a Waffle House, only with Thai cuisine (or at least, the watered-down, Americanized version of it. I also appreciate the speed for the lunch crowd. But in all, I was not too impressed."}
{"text":"As some of you might know, it is my mission to try every Thai place in the Phoenix metro area. (I've got a Yelp list going of the places I've been so far.) I've been pretty happy with a lot of the restaurants I've tried, and it's been fun to experience different preparation methods and flavor profiles. I've already tried the two other places along Central (Thai Elephant and Wild Thaiger), so last night, I thought it would be fun to call up Thai Hut and get some food to go (and enjoy at home with several rum and Diet Coke concoctions). My overall impression: Thai Hut's food isn't as complex or high-quality as the food at Swaddee or Thai Lahna and the atmosphere certainly isn't as fun and upscale as that at Wild Thaiger or Malee's, but it is solid Thai food that won't disappoint if you're having a craving. You know, kind of like your stand-by Chinese place.   We tried the Pad Thai, Panang curry, and some eggplant/tofu sautee. All three dishes came out to $30. We ordered the first two dishes medium and were really happy with how spicy they turned out. They're definitely not afraid to respect your spice wishes (unlike some places - Thai Elephant comes to mind - where our request for spicy was apparently interpreted as our not knowing what the hell we were talking about and actually wanting things gringo-mild), which I respect. The Pad Thai was a little strange-tasting, I must say. It had a strong curry flavor, which was odd - not bad, just odd. The Panang curry was pretty flavorful, but not as complex as the ones at Swaddee, Thai Lahna, or Wild Thaiger. The eggplant dish was actually my favorite. The tofu was absolutely delicious (and I usually only like fried tofu). One major complaint, though - it was ridiculously greasy. Actually, all of the dishes were a bit greasy and heavy.   I won't fault Thai Hut for being a little greasy, though. Everything was just good enough to really hit the spot and to satisfy my craving for spicy Thai food, and it felt like Asian comfort food in that sense. I used to order from my favorite Chinese take-out place again and again even though it was greasy and not the most flavorful and I felt a little twinge of regret after each meal from there. Similarly, despite its not being the lightest or most flavorful Thai I've had, I won't hesitate to return to Thai Hut for some take-out or a quick, satisfying meal."}
{"text":"No frills storefront location with absolutely delicious Mom and Pop Thai food. They have some outstanding dishes that aren't on every other menu, so if your tastes run more exotic that Pad Thai, give these guys a chance."}
{"text":"Not great food, there is clearly better Thai around, but the service that I received today was so notably rude and unprofessional that I would never again even consider this place. The woman we interacted with refused to take responsibility for errors in their online menu (we were polite, would have taken a remake of the food or a refund), even forcing my husband to speak with the online ordering company rather than have a civil conversation and make it right herself. It was absurd. We walked out without any resolution, after having two unpleasant conversations."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch today, just kind of on a whim. I'd never been in the old Marvin's Garden diner, but it didnt seem like much could have changed. Hell, the booths even have signs saying you can't sit there as a single between 11-2, lol.  When I walked in the side door, a woman looked at me and held up one finger, so I nodded yes I'm alone. She put a menu down at the counter and had a bowl of celery soup and an egg roll before I got there. Pretty good start. I took a glance at the menu and ordered the cashew nut chicken and it came within 5 minutes. The place definitely seemed to have perfected the \"quick lunch\" concept. The service was flawless from start to finish, as well. Everything I had, including the usually bland celery soup was delicious. The cashew nut chicken being probably my favorite asian dish I've had in quite some time. It all seemed very light and on the healthy side as well.  I ended up with a bill of $7.33 which for the amount of food, and the quality of food, and the quality of service, I was very pleased with. They are doing a lot of things right here, and I think this will be a very successful restaurant in the Midtown dining scene. I only hope the best for them as it really is great."}
{"text":"Went here to pick up my takeout. Restaurant wasn't the cleanest looking inside. The food was meh and it left me and the old lady feeling ill for the rest of the night. Must have been some bad meat or something.   Stay away!"}
{"text":"Just had a great meal here. The restaurant is tiny (7 tables) but feels cozy, not over crowded. The whole place feels clean and nicely decorated.   I was the only person in the restaurant, but it was 8pm on a Thursday. There was someone else picking up an order when I first arrived, but besides that it was just me. I had red curry with tofu and pumpkin, the curry was not too spicy (and I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food) but really tasty. There were a bunch of seasonal pumpkin specials for October, but none of them were quite what I want. I asked to add pumpkin to the red curry instead, and it was perfect. I also had a Thai iced tea, which was just the right amount of tea and sweetened condensed milk.   I also got an order of mango and sticky rice to go, the rice was a tad bit saltier than I would have liked but the mango was perfect. I'd definitely recommend Thai Hut. With tip my meal was about $20."}
{"text":"Worst Pad Thai yet. Tasted like a dollop of Skippy peanut butter had been added AND they actually substituted parsley for cilantro!"}
{"text":"Desperate to grab some dinner on my way back to my hotel in Downtown Phoenix, I decided on what was closest, Thai Hut. Oh I wished I drove to Wild Thaiger instead. (Wild Thaiger had better Yelp reviews but was further away).   I gave them a two instead of a one because they made the fried rice correctly but the Pad Thai was awful, super wet and not at all Pad Thai. The Orange Chicken was so scarce for the $10 they charged for it. I was completely disappointed."}
{"text":"Blech.  This place appears to have changed ownership some time in the past few months, and the food has gone way down hill.   The biggest shock has been to see what's happened to my favorite Cashew Nut Chicken, which has been turned from a light, bright, flavorful dish into nothing more than an oily mush.   I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"When Rickie mentioned going to the Thai Hut, I thought, that's funny, I'm really not in the market for neckwear. Then we drove by and it looked so cute. Like a Thai diner with lots of booths lining the windows which overlook McDowell around 3rd Ave. Obviously not a lot of money or design when into the reincarnation, but the energy of the room and the super friendly staff warmed me instantly. I swear the server telepathically took our app order as the spring rolls arrived to the table, hot and crispy, before I had even squeezed the lemon in my water. Along with the chicken satay, they were both good, not out of this world however. Rickie's \"chicken noodle\" soup was flavorful, yet the chicken was hella funky. Oddly shaped bland, poached peices of poultry particularly unpleasant. The sizzling beef was Thairiffic. Really. Thairiffic. My obligatory phad thai, although missing the tofu, was very dee lish. Prices were affordable. No beer however and that made me sad. I mean I was just costume shopping at Easley's and really could have used a large Thai cerveza. Rickie loved his Thai iced tea (me? not a fan of that beverage...sort of tastes like lawn clippings and cream). The service is outstanding...attentive, friendly and efficient. That pushes them from 3 to 4 stars easily. Great energy, good food, smiling staff. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there tonight and ran into someone who went there because of the our Yelp reviews!  He recognized me from my picture!  Rock on, Yelpers and Yelpites.  I had the Wild Boar Basil, scallion pancake and chicken coconut soup again.  Stole some of my friend's Thai style cashew chicken.  Oh, the pineapple soaked up the red sauce and made me happy.  Happy happy.  Joy joy.  Stole some of my daughter's Pad thai.  Meh-- it was mushy and only ok. It's nowhere near the great quality of the rice-on-the-side dishes.    My dear daughter had to use the bathroom, which is at the back of the kitchen, so I got a chance to scope out the back.  The kitchen is clean and tidy.  Very nice.  It makes me feel good about eating what is prepared there.  The staff deserves immediate cannonization.  They were gracious to the world's most annoying customer.  A woman with the most annoying accent on the planet grilled the poor waiter on each and every ingrediant in each and every dish.  She complained that everything had soy sauce in it, because she's sensitive to it.  She wondered why there were peanuts and if he could guarantee that peanuts would not touch anything she was going to eat, because she was sensitive to it.  She requested that they change their recipes so nothing contained oil.  I'm not sure if she was sensitive to that, but I wouldn't doubt it.  The complaints when on and on and on.  The waiter/cook was kind and accomodating and offered to do anything for her.  She ended up with what looked like a plate of steamed vegetables.  In a Thai restauraunt.  Oy.  You just have to know how to talk to people."}
{"text":"Come here ALL THE TIME - food is consistently very good at a great price!  Even the veggie soup is super flavorful.  Spring rolls are always hot & not greasy - staff is super friendly too.   If you are a snob about ambience you won't  like it - it is super casual and it is about the food not the curtains or tablecloths."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on a mid-week work lunch. I would not go to Thai Hut for dinner (not much of a vibe), but if you work downtown and want to splurge on a quick Thai lunch - this is your spot. It's speedy fast. There's a nice list of lunch specials to choose from and you'll have your soup and spring roll the minute you sit down and a gigantic drink (so you're never waiting on refills). I've never walked away unhappy. The food is tasty and the price is right."}
{"text":"Well, I really wanted to try to find a good Thai place near my new house. This isn't it. Not even close. The curry (panang w/chicken for me, masaman w/tofu for the wife) looked more like a canned beef stew than curry. Both were a weird brown thick slop with chunks of brownish stuff in it. They both looked exactly the same. The also tasted sweet with a good touch of heat. I had friends at another table who ordered entrees and they looked much better than my curry. I am giving 2 stars only because the staff was really nice and helpful. If not, it would have only been 1 star."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the BEST pad thai in Lakewood. And I believe me, I have tried them all. Theirs is good no matter how much spice you order. I have tried every level and actually prefer non spiced here. I believe the spice can mask the flavors and freshness of a lower quality dish which this place does not need.   I usually get my food to go, and the lady remembers me and my exact order every time.. Veggie Pad Thai with extra tofu.  My only issue, they are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Been going here regularly for years. Never had a bad meal or service. Yeah i've had better Thai food but not in Phx(LA SF & Vegas come to mind) I respect Yelpers but I'm at a loss for the wide range of reviews. Maybe the owners know us or maybe we're lucky but we'll keep coming back"}
{"text":"I've come here for lunch a few times and it's pretty decent. I like the soup and egg roll they serve you with each lunch order. Their dishes are okay but her more flavorful when you add the Thai spices. I'll keep coming back here from time to time because prices are reasonable and haven't had a bad experience yet."}
{"text":"Thai Hut went under new management within the past year. The food is excellent. I would like to warn the general public, the spice level is high. The lady there felt bad for me because I was defintely phased by it. She brought out some Thai iced tea that really helped. She was such a pleasure to speak with. My brethren has stated that Thai Kitchen down the street has lost its glory and touch. This is true since their management has changed and their quality slipped. A lot of folks jumped on the Thai Kitchen bandwagon lately. I urge you to try Thai Hut. The food is great. The service is perfect and it just a nice quaint place to grab some dinner. I came here with my brother and father and we all enjoyed ourselves. I have some leftovers for dinner tonight and cannot wait to get home and eat them."}
{"text":"As I've said with other Thai places they all seem the same to me. This one was just as good as the last place I have been to that served Thai. The waitress was very friendly. She was able to explain the menu items (e.g., the differences among all the curries). This is a very small place, aside from my friend and I there were two other parties here and only two empty tables. Definitely a nice local place to frequent with meter parking right in front or on the side street (meters only need to be paid M-F 8a-6p). They do take away orders as well if you want something when you leave."}
{"text":"It was walking distance from AZ Opera and we were hungry so decided to pay a visit.  Pleasantly surprised - it was nice, clean place and really good food.  The service was great and very responsive. It was a tad warm and the reason was that it is a huge place so cooling doesn't work the same in all parts of the restaurant.  The server did ask if we were hot and wanted to move.  Guess we were too lazy."}
{"text":"OH NO.  New owners.  The lunch special choices have been reduced.  The spring roll was not included in the special the day we had ours only a very lemony soup. Only 1/2 of our table ate their soup.  Most didn't care for it.     Food was good and a bit fresher than in the past, but service was HORRID. We were there for AN HOUR.  Hoping it is just going through growing pains.  We will try once more before putting it on our 'do not go- do not pass go... just a no go' list.    We liked this for a 'quick' good meal.  It's was a sloooow good meal.  Doesn't work for lunch for me."}
{"text":"Have you ever gotten an orgasm from peanuts?  No?  Well, I just did. Number 27.  Medium hot.  Went with Robert M & Bacon for dinner tonight and we each got a dish to share.  Started with the fried tofu.  Bland.  the sauces were watery.  Also got shrimp rolls.  Yummy. In all, we had a red curry (#26) which was good, but it seemed as if the green beans had been frozen then cooked.  Also, the #34, medium spicy.  Had a peanut taste, a little sweet.  And then: #27.  (angels singing) Now, I don't know the names of any dishes.  I always order by number.  When it came to the table, I drooled all over my white shirt.  And, well, something else in my white panties.  Amazing! Service was quick and friendly.  I love that it's RIGHT ON McDowell.  Tables face the street, which you don't get very often here in the PHX. My leftovers are in the fridge.  Since I'm single and need the *ahem* effects of #27, I'll be having it before bed.  As a snack.  To get ready for bed.  #27.  Marry me.  I'll be the first person to marry a number."}
{"text":"After months of suggesting Thai Hut for take-out, I am finally fulfilled! I have been wanting to come back and eat but being the good wife, we have gone to other Thai places to satisy my husband. By this point, I finally put my foot down and said \"DO NOT try to talk me out of Thai Hut!!!\" (True story, ask my husband.) I pretty much only get one thing here, the garlic pepper chicken ($10). Considering I HATE pepper in my food, this dish is delicious to me (hence why I am loyal to it). It is chopped chicken mixed with cabbage, broccoli, carrots with a nice garlicky broth. They give a pile of white rice with it, too, which is just perfect. If I put my mind to it, I can EASILY polish off most of this dish. Well, maybe the lunch size which is still a good portion. With the lunch, I can make a second meal. With a dinner, I had plenty for dinner and was able to split the rest into two lunches. Sweet! Garlic pepper chicken two more meals????? It doesn't get any better than that. If you have a chance to eat-in, try and score a window table facing McDowell...great people watching and views of the city streets. I just love it!"}
{"text":"This is a very busy location with nice service but the food quality if quite low.  Since I have lived in Thailand over a year, I know what a proper Thai food should taste like minus ingredients that they can get from the Asian markets here (As a former restauranteur myself-I know this is a huge challenge for all of us here in the USA).  The drunken noodle had too much soy sauce in it and the dish had too much corn starch which made the sauce very sticky.  Chicken broth for the coating of the dish should be light to bring out the true color of the vegetable and meat but not looking like a goo.  Thai hot was given but it is rather ordinary in my eyes..The service is very nice but I definitely weight more on the food as far as the whole experience is concerned..There are much better alternatives close by."}
{"text":"I love the food but this place seems to be in a bad area. Saw b-b holes in the glass windows. I feel bad for the owners because this could be a really nice place. The Waitresses are sweet and very approachable.  The funny thing is when they ask how hot I want the meal, I always say \"suicide hot\". I have yet to be disappointed by this place."}
{"text":"Best Thai food around Cleveland. Just finished our second visit and we are already planning what we are getting next time. The Thai puffs are delicious. The Fire Duck and garlic chicken were fantastic as well. They. Will make it as spicy as you want."}
{"text":"Per ROTD from dear friend Amy D, I wound up at Thai Hut for a lunch date with mi mami. I personally love Thai food, the perk to growing up in Cali and having friends from all over the world. My mom, she is a tough cookie to please, but she said I could choose, so Thai it was!  I tried getting myself #27, as Amy had a boombastic-orgasmic, but apparently #27 was proposed to by Amy last night, so it was not available for lunch, only for dinner. :-/  Nonetheless, my mom had the Garden Delight and she added the shrimp. She loved it! I had the Yellow Curry Chicken, as the waitress said it was the closest thing to #27. I got some crushed peanuts, cause I am single and I gotta get them anyway I can! Both these items came from the lunch menu, $7.95 includes a little soup, spring roll, and steamed rice. Of course, I had to have my Thai iced tea. I liked this place, and love that it is so close to Downtown ASU, which will make it my new Tues or Thurs spot. My mom also got the coconut ice cream, she said it was good!"}
{"text":"Nice place for a no-frills dinner. We went there around 8:30 on a Saturday night, and there were just four other diners, excluding us, though while we ate, quite a few people came in for to-go orders. I got the Thai red curry which came with steamed white rice and my friend got the cashew chicken, which also came with steamed white rice. I liked my order better because it was not very spicy, and had gravy to mop up the rice with. My friend's dish had whole cashews, which I thought didn't blend into the whole dish. Also, our dishes were rather cold. I would have liked them hotter (temperature). Oh, and one more thing....I wish the waitress would have served us with a smile.  The bill came to $21 for us, before tip, which isn't too bad for a dinner for two.   Tip: They accept to-go orders half an hour after they close (9:30 on Saturdays). How cool is that!"}
{"text":"When I heard that Thai Hut reopened last year, I nearly barfed from the total joy I felt. Years ago, I lived just a couple of blocks from this tiny storefront, and I ate takeout Pad Se Ew at least twice a week. I always found Thai Hut to be much better than its further-east-on-Madison counterpart, Thai Kitchen, and hoped that the reopened restaurant would live up to that standard. I'm happy to say it has.  The Pad Se Ew is just as flavorful as I remember, and loaded with delicious stuff: tons of tofu, greens, and Chinese broccoli, all mixed in with thick, chewy rice noodles. The curries are perfectly spiced, and the tamarind duck rocks my world.   A few cons, though: the food at times can be a bit greasy. Half of the appetizers are delicious (curry puffs, oh dear god!); the other half are just boring (sweet potato fries? whatever). The hours are kind of inconvenient. I know I'm one of the few working until 9pm on weeknights, but still... 9:30 is not that much later, and if they stayed open until then, they'd get my business at least once a week instead of once a month. Later hours on the weekend would also be a plus.   The service has always been very good whenever I eat-in, and they are very polite when picking up.   Overall, Thai Hut is a great neighborhood spot. Go, eat, be happy."}
{"text":"I'm very picky about Thai food.  My first experience with it was at a restaurant owned by a Thai woman (the cook) who would never let anyone in the kitchen with her (no assistants, no family, nada) and was prone to throwing temper tantrums that would cause her husband (ex-military and the only waiter) to have to shut down the place for the night.  Thai Hut unfortunately doesn't live up to that first experience, but there's a much smaller chance that the restaurant will close down while you're waiting for your meal to arrive, so it has that going for it.  We had the Tom Kha Gai, which was tasty, with the perfect twangy afterbite that a good Tom Kha Gai has.  Our Green Curry, however, was lackluster and bland.  We actually ended up pouring some of the Tom Kha Gai into our Green Curry, which worked out really well.  We also tried some form of crispy Pad Thai (not sure of the name), which was decent.  Never had that type of noodle before, though, so I had nothing to compare it to.  Overall, the environment was an odd combination of bar and sterile fast-food-chain (plasticy booths) and the food was variable.  Not bad, but not a life-changing experience."}
{"text":"Great service, fantastic food, each and every time. Takeout is just as great, although getting a noodle soup to go isn't as good as an experience as eating it in.  Very friendly.  Seems family owned/operated, but I'm not sure.  I've been here many times over the past few years."}
{"text":"Mom and Pop Thai place in Lakewood.  Love the atmosphere.   Brought my middle school aged daughter here because she is adventurous.   She ordered the duck and appreciated how special it felt to eat in a restaurant so small it felt like home. She chose it again when we were out with some of her friends and they had a good time, too.   I have had better pad Thai but it was enjoyable.  The choo Che  and red curry were not  best I have had but it was still good and I didn't have to drive all the way to Asia town.   You walk through the kitchen to get to the restroom and it was huge compared to the seating area.   Funny since it was just an elderly couple cooking.  They smiled and waved.  Kitchen was spotlessly clean."}
{"text":"The pad thai I like! Ive only done carry out, and I only get pad thai, because it is delicious. It doesn't really get better than here. They cook fast! I placed an order over the phone, the lady said 20 min, it was ready in 10 min. And when I got there I decided to order another pad thai and it was ready in less than 10 min.   I would eat in if I really needed to. Its not the greatest atmosphere, and the cooks are the servers, and theres nothing wrong with that. I just like an experience when I eat in...  None-the-less,  Thai Hut, is DELICIOUS, FAST, and AFFORDABLE. A must try for Lakewood."}
{"text":"It was soooo good! I don't like Asian food, and I am not a big fan of spring rolls. BUT this place has the best! A friend years ago told me to try it and I didn't until today. I wish I would have gone before!!"}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland. Hole in the wall restaurant that is very intimate. Husband and wife establishment. Food is AUTHENTIC thai. Not greasy but flavorful. Next time visiting Cleveland will be back again."}
{"text":"The boy and I really like Thai food. Well... we really like ALL food... but especially Thai. We have been to all of the bigger names. This place is super non-descript. In fact, we had a hard time even finding it (hint - its on the South side of Madison Ave).   When you walk in, it has that perfect divey feel... you know, the one that makes you think your meal is either a) going to give you food poisoning or b) be the most authentic meal you've had. Luckily for us, it was the latter.   The place might have had carpet - and dusty plants in the window. And, the \"server\" might have also been the chef. I don't really know. Don't worry too much about it. The food makes up for the decor.    They also asked me to pick my spiciness level no a scale of 1-10. I really like spicy, so I went with a 6... BIG mistake. A 6 is like death fire!!! It was still good... but my sinuses were cleared for a month after that.   The boy had Pad Thai and I had green curry. Both were amazing.   The woman who I presume owned it was very sweet and attentive. This is our favorite Thai in CLE. I'm hoping it stays nondescript because they only have 3-4 tables. It would be a shame to have to wait. ;)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Lakewood Thai place. I like to dine in, it's quaint and quiet, the lady who takes orders is very polite. I love the Pad Thai here, it's flavorful with sweet and sour flavors and will make it to desired heat level and it tastes fresh! The spring rolls are perfect and I like the dipping sauce it's sweet and sour at the right level. The chicken on stick is amazing (although small) with a great texture and they serve it with the most delicious sauces one peanut and the other sweet/sour with bits of cucumber. This is what I order here and I have yet to find a place where these dishes are equal or better and I've tried every Thai place in Lakewood. Other than here I prefer Ty Fun."}
{"text":"Can anyone tell me how to get a 1/2 star. I've been to the \"Hut\" twice now and wish I could find out how to use a 1/2 star.   4 stars for food but I have to close my eyes so I don't have an acid flashback of a Denny's in LA after seeing Pink Floyd in I think 72.  We got an appetizer of the Chicken Satay....here is why I need to figure out 1/2 stars. This was the very best!!!!! I mean really, really good!   Wife had and I shared the # 58 and #68, I think. One was red curry with beef and it was 3.5. The other dish was a dish with a flat noodle, Chinese Broccoli and chicken. Out of this world. When I first saw the plate, I thought \"Gonna have leftovers tomorrow\" which is always a good thing. No leftovers on what ever that was. It was scrum delicious. Sandra K says she loves that kinda Wok burnt flavor that you get only with oriental cooking.  We topped it off by sharing a cup of homemade coconut ice cream and it was a perfect dessert to top off the dinner.  I wanted to have \"Pla\" like I get at Malee's but they don't make that, but I suggest that to Bee, one of the owners. I commented on the name \"Hut\" which to me is not endearing, but she has good memories of how they got their name. Hut to me is just not too endearing, but then again, I have been to some cutesy Thai named places to be very underwhelmed with the food.  So here goes; Food....4 and it can go to 4.5 Atmosphere and with a mouthful of wide noodles and eyes closed 4.5 Service.....3.5 Value and Price   4  Happy eating"}
{"text":"the first time i stepped into this building was 20 years ago, i believe it was called Marven Gardens and it was a diner. i had grits. i was 8.   many years and many diners have come and gone. never a \"real\" restaurant in that time. so Thai Hut goes up and I've been told its delish.   everyone there is full of smiles and greet you when you enter the door with a hand sign of \"how many people?\", 2 fingers up, you nod, and your seated. simple. words are overrated anyways.   slide into a booth and within a few minutes you have very large cups of water and someone taking your drink order. our waitress had the cutest face, reminded me of Raven Simone from the Cosby show.   Pad Thai is pretty good, the Pad Cee Eww was good, a little light on the sauce. pepper steak was good. the ginger dish from the specialties is very good. sauce is thin. but the flavor is there.  all the vegetables in their dishes are crisp and very bright. no mushy vegetables.  everything I've had is good...except, the orange chicken. avoid at all costs. I'm used to a sauce made from orange or mandarin peals. this orange chicken is...flavored with a Hi-C reduction or Tang. its fucking sick. i got it for take out. almost killed me. i will never make that mistake again.     i will certainly keep going back."}
