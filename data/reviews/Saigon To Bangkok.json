{"text":"My husband and son and I ate here for the first time this past weekend.  The atmosphere is much better than we expected--the whole feel is more upscale than many Asian restaurants, with plenty of authentic decorations.  
The crab rangoons were among the best we've ever had.  The chicken satay appetizers were \"OK\"--other Thai places I've been serve more than just two skewers, but they were still pretty good.  Not as much flavor as they could have had.
My son (age 10) really liked the grilled beef entree.  It came with noodles.  The meat was very tasty, but the noodles were thick and served cold--kind of like eating worms.  Not good, but maybe this is commonly done--we just didn't like that.  Many good veggies with it, though.
My husband had the chicken pad thai and liked it--a generous serving.  Now, to my dish... I wanted to try pho since I'd never had it.  With my current cold/cough I was eager for a hot soup to soothe me.  Being adventurous, I tried the Pho Dac Biet (a combination pho.)  Big mistake!  It came with tendon and tripe--or \"cow stomach\" as I learned.  The odor from the broth even made it through my congestion.... I couldn't \"stomach\" it!  I picked around and tried to eat some noodles and greens, but kept scooping out chunks of bumpy stomach lining and tendons.  Not exactly appetizing, at least for me.  So BE CAREFUL!  I guess I was ignorant in my adventure, but I really wish I had tried the plain chicken pho.  
The servers were excellent and very friendly.  I would try it again but would order something safer next time."}
{"text":"Excellent place compared to other Thai places in town. Unfortunately, they don't get much business every time I'm there (hopefully they stay open!).

Most/all places \"Americanize\" the dishes, so if it comes out too sweet, not spicy enough, etc. they are always willing to alter it as long as you ask. That's true for any place I imagine. So if it was just OK the first time, try changing it and go again.

FYI when you get something at \"1-spicey\" that means they put in 1 pepper. Each new level means that many peppers (the hot Thai peppers). So obviously, 1 pepper/spice rating in a cup of soup will be much worse than a 2-level in a large entree.

If you like mango with sweet sticky rice dessert, I like it at this place the most."}
{"text":"FYI: The restaurant is now called Bangkok Thai.

Sweetie and I came here for a pho fix. We also had spring rolls and the papaya salad. This has been our only C-U pho so far, so our only comparisons are the California Bay Area and Chicago. The pho broth is a little sweet, a little less anise-y than we are used to, and the pho itself is pretty skimpy on the meat. Sweetie had the beef balls and said they were ok.  The green papaya salad was good; we asked for a lot of spice and they made it quite tastily spicy.  All in all an ok experience, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Have tried 3 dishes and several appetizers and they were all really tasty. I can't say I know much about Thai for but everything I have ordered has been delicious and the service is second to none. The owner often waits on customers himself and his kind, helpful attitude and attentive service really make the experience. It is now called Bangkok Thai. If you like this type of food at all you should really try this place out."}
{"text":"We ate here last night after stopping by Friar Tuck's. We had a bottle of wine with us, and the waitress offered to uncork it for us (for free!). We had gotten it for later though, so we didn't end up drinking wine with our meal, but we think we'll be back to do this in the near future.

I ordered Asparagus Stir Fry, and my fiance ordered Pad Thai. I really liked my dish; the only complaint I would have is that the sauce, after eating it for a while, tasted salty. The Pad Thai was tasty too, though it wasn't my fave. It had a flavor that I wasn't expecting (although the waitress told us that it tasted different than most Pad Thais).

The staff was really friendly and nice, we enjoyed our time here, and will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Bangkok Thai has delicious Thai and Vietnamese food. I tried the pho, green and red curries, and pad thai. All were tasty. 

The portions were large. Price was very reasonable.

Eating at Bangkok Thai was very satisfying. I recommend it."}
{"text":"This review is for this restaurant in its previous incarnation in Iowa City. I'm just hoping it gets a lot of support in the University of Illinois neighborhood, and wanted the new customers to know how sorely Kim and her family restaurant were missed in the University of Iowa community! Tragically, the little restaurant that they had so recently and lovingly redecorated, was lost in the Flood of June 2008. We often ate simple satisfying pho meals there, and a void is left in Iowa City. We were glad to hear that they'd relocated closer to extended family, and wish them well!"}
{"text":"Best Pho I have had in the 217.  Rolled in for lunch on a Tuesday.  Kinda taken back when you see a big spot with no one in it.   Whatever.  I rocked the basic Pho, and rocked it well.  Good service, nice vibe."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight for carry out and I can't think of a time that I've had better Thai food. I got a #28. I don't remember what it was called but it had carrots, green beans and eggplant. I ordered it with beef and holy moly! Good food. They left out my daughter's \"kids fried rice,\" which was too bad and we didn't realize it until we got home.  However, she is 3 and didn't mind, so crisis averted."}
{"text":"I like to consider this restaurant one of my little eating secrets.  I eat here frequently, but have only managed to make it through a few menu items.  I've been impressed by everything I've ordered, as well as the bites I've stolen from my friends' plates.  Four+ stars for the tofu pad thai, pho, ginger chicken (very gingery), and curries.  Once I tried #B31 (noodles with sweet/spicy sauce and stir fried beef) though, I couldn't bring myself to order anything else.  It is delicious.  

For appetizers, I love the spring rolls (they come with a yummy peanut sauce), but the Vietnamese pancake is really something special.  My friends like the Thai iced tea, and I love the homemade limeade.  Ask your server for recommendations, everyone there is very friendly and can give you details about all of the menu items.  The owner (I think?) is a real character, she's always happy to see you and loves to recommend new menu items you might like (and once she knows you, she can also tell you which ones won't be quite your thing).  The last time I brought a big group in, I asked her to surprise my husband and I with something she knew we'd like.  I ended up with a spicy shrimp dish, and my husband got \"chef seafood special\".  Still no word on whether the special will be offered as part of the menu, but it was very tasty and included several types of seafood (some that we couldn't identify, but all were yummy).  Her young daughter is also very friendly and super-cute (I think she's about 5 or 6).  If you're lucky, she'll stop by your table for a chat and to bring you your check.  

The atmosphere is clean, quiet, and much nicer than I expected, given the strip-mall store front.  Dress is casual, prices are reasonable, and service is usually very fast (but I've never been there when it's crowded).  Give it a try, it's a nice escape from the overcrowded Prospect-area chains."}
{"text":"Food
The quality of the ingredients was ok, but the quality of the cooking in both presentation and taste was amazing. 

Atmosphere
The location next to a movie theatre and giant desert of a parking lot isn't great. Inside kinda looks a bit tacky, but in that kinda charming kitsch way that lower end asian restaurants often go for."}
{"text":"This evening my husband and I decided to check out this Saigon replacement, to see how it compares with the previous restaurant and other pho offerings in the area.

My husband had the Hutieu Nam-Yang, which is described as \"special cambodia style chewy noodle soup.\" I had the Pho Ga, or chicken pho, basically. We also split an order of Banh Xeo, or Vietnamese pancakes. 

To be clear, the noodles in the Hutieu Nam-Yang are not chewy, but it can (and was) interpreted this way, so you have been warned. The chewiness really comes from the seafood that has been cooked in the food, especially squid. My husband enjoyed the broth especially, and said that he thought this pho was on par with his favorite place in town: Thara Thai.

The Pho Ga was tasty, although I prefer broths that are slightly more floral, so the TT still has my vote. Our Vietnamese pancake, by the way, was awesome.

I am not sure who our server was this evening, but she was very nice and hopeful that we would come back. I think we definitely will!"}
{"text":"Closed permanently. 

See photos taken February 19, 2013."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers Viet and Thai food.  We tried only Viet food, but everything we ordered was great.  We ordered the Viet spring rolls, Pho, and Pork Chops.  Everything was great, and came out very quickly.  Compared to other Viet places I've been to in the past, I found their food to be tasty and on par.  As other people have commented, the atmosphere is clean and nicely decorated.  Will come here again in the future."}
{"text":"Our first try since the recent change in management. Seated by a very cute 6-year-old hostess. Started with Vietnamese egg rolls and rice pancake. Both delicious, but had to ask for more lettuce to wrap the pancake.

Main courses were both off the specials board. My wife's was barbecue chicken lemon grass -- grilled chicken breast with excellent flavor. Mine was sole clay pot -- wonderfully delicate tender sole. The sauce was slightly saltier than optimal, but still quite tasty. I also had lemonade (limeade), which was very nice, though somewhat sweeter than I'd probably make for myself. If made with carbonated water, it would have been a big win. We will certainly be returning here soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty good thai food in Champaign.  All of mostly got pho which was pretty good - sweet broth than i'm used to.  I got the egg noodle with bbq pork and it was really really tasty.  Usually bbq pork is dry (atleast the ones i've eaten in chicago) but this was not the case at all.  Plus the broth was really flavorful after a night of bar-crawling.  It's a bit more expensive than what i'm used to.  $15 for soup and thai iced coffee.  Coffee was delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm waffling between three and four stars on this one... Although we had excellent service, I think I'm going to go with my gut and stick with three.

My boyfriend and I ordered an appetizer of crab rangoons, which were kind of boring.  Too much cream cheese, not enough crab/krab.  Half were burned, and the other half weren't heated all the way through.  Our waitress explained that \"some were from yesterday's batch.\" (?)  Ooookay.  I wish we would have gone with the spring rolls!

But my Pho Ga (a dish I'd never had before) was hot, comforting, and delicious.  I would certainly order it again, although the waitress said that they use beef broth (pho bo) and just add chicken, while a traditional pho ga is made with chicken broth.  My boyfriend ordered the Pad Kee Mao, which was way different than he'd ever had it anywhere else.  At every Thai restaurant we've been to, Pad Kee Mao is served spicy, but not here.  He had to ask for it to be made spicy.  (And boy, was it!)  I think he enjoyed it, but he said it just didn't taste like Pad Kee Mao.  If we return, I think we'll both stick to the Viet side of the menu!"}
