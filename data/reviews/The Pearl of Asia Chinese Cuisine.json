{"text":"Previously known as the Oriental Century Chinese Restaurant. Much better service after management changed hands.  Today my family and I trekked out in our snow gear to have some hearty dim sum.   We ordered the following: Shrimp Cheung Fun (Rice Noodle Roll)  Har Gow (Shrimp Dumpling) x 2 - the Dumpling wrapper was too thick for my liking.  Beef Tripe - overcooked and mushy. Tripe should have a bit of a crunch to it.  Chicken Feet w/ Bean Sauce x 2 - By far the best chicken feet I've had. Very-well marinated and intense in flavor! You can tell by the depth of the color that it was going to be Mmmmm.....  Chinese Beef Meatballs - not particularly tasty  Egg White Custard x 2 - Not oversteamed but they don't quite have the consistency right. A Chinese egg white custard be firm but still be wobbly. With that said, although the custard was a little too firm, the creaminess factor was not compromised.  Calamari - nice color to them. It means they're using fresh oil to fry them in.  Spinach-Scallop Dumpling Cake - It was cold. Wasn't fresh. I've had this before, and it was good when it was fresh and warm.  But today it was just not good!  Osmanthus Longan Pudding - Very light and refreshing. Like drinking an iced tea on a hot summer day. The Longan and goji berries really accent the Osmanthus.   Other things we ordered but I did t try: Bean Curd Roll Deep Fried Taro Pastry (Salty)  All in all $44 including tip for 4 people. I'll be back."}

{"text":"The Pearl of Asia Chinese Cuisine is runned by the same people from the Ruby Restaurant http://www.yelp.ca/biz/ruby-chinese-restaurant-ltd-scarborough. So if you frequent Ruby Restaurant before, you will see familar faces working here.  We were here on a weekday for normal dim sum. So the place was not crowded at all. If you still want to experienced the old Chinese dim sum with people pushing the carts, this is the place to go. Though if you are in a rush, the waiter staff can just take your orders and order the dim sum directly from the kitchen for you. This is a option, since you might sit there for ages before something that you want to eat pushed by you!  The food is ok... standard dim sum items.   Best value is to come for early morning or afternoon tea where all items are for $2.20. However, right now they have 10% discount extra at all time.  They accepts Visa and Mastercard."}
