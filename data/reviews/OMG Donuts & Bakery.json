{"text":"Great staff, good coffee and excellent doughnuts.  

They are good sized doughnuts that are not overly sweet.  The fillings are tasty and the variety is nice.  They patiently helped us out even though it was closing time.  Recommended."}
{"text":"My daughter & I enjoy donuts and seek out donut shops locally and whenever we travel. We were happy to find OMG tucked away in a small shopping center. We were cheerfully greeted when we entered. There was a wide variety of flavors, some cereal themed and even some topped with bacon. We tried the glazed (plain & chocolate iced), a Smores, raspberry filled and a cinnamon bun. The donuts were light, fresh, and airy with a fantastic yeasty flavor. I love that they will fill your donut \"on demand\" with chocolate, raspberry, strawberry or lemon filling. The cinnamon bun was huge and took 2 sessions to finish. Prices were reasonable too! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located off Concord Mills Blvd, their Donuts are fresh and so yummy! Love that you can make your own by adding the filing you want."}
{"text":"I love donuts and this place does not disappoint!   The dough is delicious and soft and they fill it with different things right in front of you so you really get to create your own!"}
{"text":"Pretty yummy donuts ! I came on a rainy Saturday afternoon and I just knew the would be closed because they ran out of donuts but to my surprise they were open. I was immediately greeted by a sweet young lady. As I thought, most of the selection for the day had been sold but I was able to get some donuts. I like the donuts but they are a little too thick for my liking. The concept is cute though and the icings are good. I think everyone should at least try it once."}
{"text":"Ok, so...these are just about the best donuts I've ever eaten!! There are \"fillable\" donuts that can be filled on the spot! The maple-bacon is over the charts delicious! Then the Apple fritter is huge, delicious and it's a for sure purchase every time! The lemon fill is so tart and lucious! Bavarian cream is to die for!! Very reasonable pricing. Donuts are big, not scrimpy at all."}
{"text":"First came across OMG when I ate at the nextdoor Mexican restaurant (great as well).  The bakery was closed because they had sold out early!  Immediately, I knew I had to come back and try it out.  Today was the day.  From the moment I walked in, the smell of fresh donuts was intoxicating.  The selection was robust, but it wasn't until I selected a few cream filled donuts did I find something truly unique and remarkable.  The jelly/cream filled donuts are empty!  Keep reading...  Empty, because you get to pick the filling they put inside!!!  I ordered 2 chocolate covered with Bavarian cream, 1 strawberry shortcake with strawberry jelly, and an oreo with chocolate filling.  There were others to choose from, but I needed a reason to convince the family that we missed a few and needed to go back really soon.

I guess I should tell you about the taste...  maybe the lightest and fluffiest donut I've ever eaten.  Easily the best donut in Cabarrus County, if not all of North Carolina."}
{"text":"Excellent light, fluffy doughnuts! The girls working were awesome and helpful. Such a happy place! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If I was to judge this place solely on the flavor and quality of the donuts it would be an instant five star rating. Though this was my first visit to the physical location I've had a couple of opportunities to try some of their treats as a good friend of mine frequents this place. I have previously tried both the fruity pebbles and cookies and creme donuts and today I tried a regular glazed \"long john\" and all have been delicious. The style of their donuts is a chewy doughy kind of consistency, think an original glazed from Krispy Kreme but a little denser (and arguably better depending on your taste.) I truly enjoy the products sold here. So why the three star review? Well there were a couple of issues that held me back from higher praise. The first isn't really their fault, but I feel it's worth mentioning. The location is in a teeny tiny strip mall near Great Wolf Lodge, and while the inside of the building does have some decent room, the parking lot does not. I assume a bit of the extra traffic was for today being National Donut Day, or maybe they are simply just that popular, but there wasn't a spot to be found. I had to park at the gas station nearby and walk over. My second and more serious complaint was lack of product. They simply didn't have any donuts. They have two six foot long glass cases with four shelves each, on a good day there is probably enough room for several hundred donuts in there. This morning they had less than ten individual donuts in that whole space, with maybe five or six more on a rack behind the counter. When I got up to the counter I picked my two from the meager selection and asked what was up. They said that someone was in the back making more but it would be about fifteen minutes until they came out and she didn't know what variety they were working on. That isn't a crazy amount of time but unfortunately I had somewhere to be and couldn't stay. Just kind of put a damper on what I hoped would be such a wonderful experience. I plan to return soon for another attempt as the donuts are worth it in my opinion. I'd like to give these folks a higher rating so I hope the next visit goes smoother."}
{"text":"Wife loves this place, wish they had bagels *wink wink* but yeah, the donuts are great here. Always taste fresh."}
{"text":"These donuts are amazing.  Taste fresh and delicious.  My son ate his entire donut before we got home... We will be back and will tell our family who is coming from out of town!!!"}
{"text":"Neat little spot near Concord Mills. My first time grabbing donuts on this side of town. It's behind the Wendy's in a little strip mall. The space itself is very cute and open, with plenty of little tables to sit and enjoy your goodies.  I'm not sure what it's like early in the morning, since we went at around 2pm on a rainy Saturday. There were still about 8-10 don't flavors to choose from. We tried a half dozen, getting an apple fritter, Oreo, peanut butter, strawberry glazed, plain glazed and bacon. They aren't as extravagantly decorated as some of Charlotte's donut spots but they are tasty! With some of them, you can infuse certain creams into them, which is a nice creative touch. There's vanilla, chocolate, lemon, strawberry and Bavarian cream flavors to choose from. The workers were all very friendly, and gave us a free donut
Hole to enjoy while we paid. The donut holes are 6 for $.95!"}
{"text":"I have always liked bacon maple donuts but I CRAVE these! I don't know if anyone else's will ever compare. They are AMAZING! Everything else is great too but I just always get the perfect donut, my kids and hubby get all the rest."}
{"text":"Husband was told to go here by a work colleague, and as I, his loving wife, was still recovering from a potluck hangover with girlfriends from the night before, he decided donuts were an acceptable Sunday brunch. He brought home a mixed dozen, all of which were fresh, but my favorite was the strawberry filling. These are larger than Krispy Kreme or Dunkin Donuts, and they're soft and chewy with delightfully crispy edges. The donut itself is not overly sweet, but their glazes are more than enough to compensate. Very reminiscent of old fashioned yeast donut shops. Pretty sure you'd be the star of fellowship hour if you showed up with these. ( If that still goes on. I dunno if Jesus has banned gluten yet.)"}
{"text":"This.place.is.AWESOME. Best donuts I've ever tasted. Not your ordinary donut, the taste is indescribable. You'll just have to find out for yourself!! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Made to order gourmet donuts... need I say more!? This place is unique and the quality is top notch. If you are looking for something special to bring to a gathering, OMG is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Best apple fritters in Charlotte! And you get to pick your own filling for some varieties. This is my new favorite donut shop... My waistline is in trouble."}
{"text":"I honestly didn't think I'd find a donut that would rival the donut place that allows you to drizzle and dip and crumble...well, they've done it!

This was my second attempt at trying this place. The first time was thwarted because of Concord Mills mall traffic. I decided it wasn't worth sitting in the traffic. 

Well, if I knew then what I know now...what traffic?!?! I need donuts, dammit!

I walk in after an hour on the treadmill at the gym and I was hit with the aroma of donuts, it was like what I think My Heaven would smell like. Cuz there are no calories, fat or carbs in Heaven...not My Heaven!

I'm standing there and I see canisters of Bavarian cream, vanilla and chocolate cream, strawberry,...all fillings I could choose to put in those yummy looking donuts.

I ordered a cinnamon roll and vanilla frosted with sprinkles for my son and an apple fritter for myself. That fritter is so huge I felt a surge of guilt even considering getting another donut to fill with the Bavarian cream. Have you ever had Bavarian cream? You want to lather yourself in it. So I didn't get it, but I am going to next time.

I couldn't wait to get home. Before I was even in front of the mall, I took a piece of the apple fritter and bit into it. My exact words were...'Oh My God!' Then I looked like a wide-eyed emoji because it hit me that's the name of the bakery!!! So you guys obviously picked the perfect name. It was lightly crispy on the outside and just YUMMYLICIOUS on the inside! Ugh, that fritter was freakin incredible!

Seriously, these are THE BEST donuts! I even stole a small bite of my son's donuts. And I'm having a craving as I type so I may be there tomorrow after the gym again.

Not too many places get 5 stars on my first visit. So you MUST try this place. I'll probably be there when you arrive. If I'm not inside, I'll likely have my face pressed against the outside window trying to maintain my composure."}
{"text":"Pastry donuts at their finest! The glaze is buttery and sweet. Apple fritters are delicious. Grab a cup of their coffee and a donut- you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I having been driving by this place for weeks, fighting the temptation to stop until a hot Sunday afternoon after a 4 hour drive....I felt I deserved to waste a few calories.  They were out of a few flavors but folk were still pouring in to get whatever they had left.  They stuff your donuts to order as they have the fillings as you come in and you can pick your filling and they just make it happen while you watch, sweet!   They also have an area to sit if you'd like.

I'm simple with my donuts, so I opted for chocolate and cinnamon/sugar.  The donuts are larger than most which makes them a bit too doughy for me.  The chocolate just didn't do it for me, but the cinnamon sugar was ok.  I probably should've wasted my calories on pizza or something, but the staff and location are nice, but parking was a little tight."}
{"text":"Finally found good donuts north of Charlotte! They are doughy and the staff is friendly.. highly recommended. We loved the cinnamon roll, cinnamon sugar, and the Oreo filled with vanilla crepe. Yum! They are more of the classic doughnut as opposed to the lighter tiny doughnuts like you get at Duck Donuts.. equally tasty, just bigger and fluffier! Also a great value! $10 for 6 huge donuts and a large coffee :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! You can't go wrong with anything you order here. Their strawberry donuts, which has real strawberry's in the icing, are unforgettable! Drop by for a tasty whole or donut of your choice, but be quick! Once their sold out for the day that's it!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, but not the best I've had. I wouldn't drive that far again for them. 
I like wake n bake better in Carolina Beach. 
I thought the chocolate frosting was a little off.
Just remembered..there were eggs shells in the doughnuts!!"}
{"text":"The best donuts around !  The Bavarian creme  / Boston creme are very good . The best I have had !! Friendly staff and very clean inside !"}
{"text":"\"OH MY GOSH\" were the first words that came out of my mouth after the first bite. Yeah, very cliche but this place is one of my new favorite donut shops!

The shop isn't much to look at from the outside, but the inside is cute and open. They have a couple of instagram worthy walls. Ample seating. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Great selection of donuts.

I ordered an iced Vietnamese coffee and a dozen variety:
Glazed
Blueberry
Strawberry fruity pebbles
Smores
Chocolate twist
Strawberry shortcake with vanilla filling (your choice of filling)

Again, these donuts were amazing! The dough was soft and perfect. The frosting was neither too sweet nor too heavy. My favorite of the six was actually the glazed. The iced Vietnamese coffee was strong yet refreshing. Not too sweet either. My entire order was under $13! This was a pleasant surprised because I'm used to spending double that for \"gourmet donuts.\" Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Hats off to the hard-working folks at OMG Donuts as sweet magic must be in their DNA. Truly unique donuts that are the perfect treat at the end of the week, I could definitely see myself making this a TGIF present at the end of the week! I had a quick LOL at all of the funny coffee mugs displayed on the wall as you walk in...

...OK alphabet soup over! I was going to try and put an acronym in every sentence and after 10 minutes of writing it seemed really silly! On a more serious note I'm really happy with this place and the fact that they are just off the main Concord Mills strip. They are to donuts what Blaze Pizza is to pies: Custom!

Custom? Yes, Custom! The first case of donuts as you walk in are all fill-able with your choice of Strawberry, Raspberry, Bavarian Creme, and Vanilla (I swear I know I'm missing one). This \"fill on demand\" method of selling donuts is awesome! While the donuts are already super fresh, the filling being left out until your ready keeps the pastry structure from getting 'congealed' and maintaining as much of texture as possible.

While there are a lot of new donut places popping up all around the Charlotte area, I'm glad to have one that has a nice, doughy, yeasty donut. While a lot of places tout a cake-like batter or a very crispy exterior, OMG had an all around \"full package\" profile with a softer, chewier donut. Imagine Krispy Kreme, only better... so much better.

Wide variety of flavors that are always changing, they're sure to have something you're going to love from the first visit. Unlike a lot of places around here, they're making donuts throughout the day, and stay open during their entire business hours, not just when they run out!

A real winner here, no wonder I'm fat!"}
{"text":"We stop by on November 4.  When I opened  the door, the bakery scent was intoxicating. I was like a kid in a candy store. The best part is the donuts was exactly what I expected. One word delicious."}
{"text":"OMG or should I say OH SWEET BABY JESUS these are some of the best donuts I have ever tasted. Pleasant staff, cozy store, and crowed full of people. We are traveling from Florida due to hurricane Irma and our hotel is located across the street, we had heard good things about this place. It did not disappoint, will definitely be going back before we head back to Florida."}
{"text":"I hadn't planned on stopping here initially, but I grabbed a quick bite at JITB, from across the street, before the auto show and as I was headed to Charlotte Speedway, I saw in the corner of my eye that there were donuts. Naturally, I had to check it out. What can I say? I stop for donuts. 

The shop is cute. There isn't much seating available. Parking was packed! Anyway, let's talk donuts. The donuts are so, so fresh. They fill them as you order. There are filling machines with various flavors ranging from cream to jelly. 

My mind, actually my mouth, is/was blown away by the perfection that these fluffy, delicious pillows of greatness have attained. Seriously! I'm a bit of a donut aficionado. I've had donuts/doughnuts from all over the world. The ones here are nearly perfect.

They have three levels of donuts: Oh, Oh My, and Oh My Goodness. The fancy ones are the OMG, like the s'mores. The original glazed is just Oh, but what an Oh it is! I got 18 donuts total to share with the guys at the auto show. Donuts for those who make donuts. Drifting car joke. You probably didn't get it.

Jokes aside, these donuts are an absolute must when you are in the area. They are so good!"}
{"text":"Best donuts ever!! Such a great variety and so good! My favorite is the cookies & cream one. Pretty good prices too. Got half a dozen donuts of Oh and Oh My for 8$!"}
{"text":"OMG! I love these donuts. So stop #3 on my donut crawl and this was my second time at this place. I recently went a few weeks ago after seeing it as a Hot New Business in my area. I stopped in after work around 4:30 and there was literally only 3 donuts left, I was a little disappointed but really enjoyed the maple pecan donut I ordered so I promised I would be back but at an earlier time the next time. 
Don't be surprised if you visit during the winter and its hard to get the front door open, supposedly the concrete on the side walk in front of the store swells and rises when it is really cold. The door barely opening did not stop me from getting in to get some donuts.
Coming in on a Saturday around 5pm I was nervous there would be a lack of options to choose from but surprisingly they were well stocked with a variety of donuts. I mean they have all kinds of donuts, chocolate frosting with all kinds of toppings, vanilla frosting with all kinds of toppings, apple fritters, donuts that are fillable with choices of jelly or crème fillings, cinnamon buns, so much!
 I was really excited and indecisive on my selection. I ordered another maple pecan donut but it was great last time, we ordered a plain glazed donut but chose to fill it will strawberry jelly and we ordered an apple fritter. 
The donuts are yeast donuts and they are good size but very light in the inside. The frosting is not overly sweet on the donuts which I love and I find it hard to eat more than 1 donut so I have leftovers for a snack later.
I don't know what it is about these donuts but I have become a fan, I love them!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to buy a couple of donuts but unfortunately they were all sold out in the early afternoon. Unfortunately someone had ordered a ridiculous amount of donuts and they sold everything they had. Oh well. It happens I guess. The only thing they had left was apple fritters so I bought one of those and OMG is right!!  That apple fritter was AMAZING!! Hopefully the next time I visit they will have donuts that I can try."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The donuts are fresh, and the selection is vast, and the prices are VERY reasonable. The only downfall is that they have been running out of donuts, but I know that it is because more people are finding out about this gem. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Amazing!! Amazing!! Everything is sooooo fresh and yummy! We couldn't just get one dozen we got two. Owner super friendly and sweet. They have all different and unique flavors maple bacon, fruity pebbles, strawberry shortcake, peanut butter, glazed, almond chocolate , custard, strawberry, raspberry, cream & lemon filling is your choice what you want. If you haven't been there you must!!"}
{"text":"O. M. G. I think these are the best donuts I've ever had! They taste so homemade and fresh. My favorite is the long john with vanilla stuffing. Oh yeah, you get to choose your donuts AND choose the filling and watch them stuff them! It's a very cute, Instagram worthy, shop and they have specialty (OMG) donuts too like Reese's cup, coconut, strawberry shortcake, brownie, maple bacon etc. You have got to try these donuts!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited OMG Donuts while in Charlotte for a wedding. We LOVED the variety and unique flavored donuts available and the staff was super friendly! We had such a hard time deciding on which donut to get. He opted for a custom filled one, you can choose from chocolate, cream, fruit etc for many different iced donuts. I couldn't resist the Resse's topped chocolate iced one. We loved the donuts, but after a wedding hangover wished they had better coffee. This place would get 10 billion stars if they served fresh local coffee, espresso and latte options. But regardless, we will be coming back for sweets, just with coffee already in hand!"}
{"text":"I don't eat donuts often but these are amazing! My husband and I took my daughter for a treat and ended up buying a dozen donuts. I had the chocolate bar with Bavarian creme inside. It was delicious  The Kona coffee was good as well. Will be back to treat myself!"}
{"text":"Food: Best donuts in concord, at least in my opinion. I've tried a lot of different things and they're all pretty good. My least favorite donut was the fruity pebbles donut. And my favorite is the filled chocolate glazed. If you like filling definitely get a filled donut. They're the best. The coffee is also great with a very pleasant smell. Although they often run out of some of their things by the end of the day. 
Service: The service is great and they make you feel appreciated as a regular customer. 
Atmosphere: The location is pretty nice. And the seating is good. Always clean and lots of seating and tables."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a coworker and wanted to check it out, since I didn't live too far away. Having visited , I can tell they are up to something good. This visit, I just got a dozen doughnut holes for less than $3. Today they had plain and cinnamon sugar. Both were very tasty and light . Some of the larger doughnuts under the glass were Oreo and Strawberry Shortcake to name a few. The team behind the counter were very friendly and the business itself accepts Apple Pay ."}
{"text":"I try to stop by at least twice a month and get a dozen assorted to take to work. Everyone I work with absolutely loves them. One of my coworkers says they are the best donuts he has ever had. I love the fact that you choose which filling you want in all of the filled ones. That way I can order them the way I like them and they are not soggy from the filling sitting in them. My absolute favorite is the strawberry topped with strawberry filling, it is wonderful. We also have tried the apple fritters and they are very good. Not only do they have good food but I also get the iced coffee with extra caramel and it is very good. Lastly they are so much bigger than other donuts."}
{"text":"Great donuts and pastries.  The apple fritters are the best I have had in years. The croissants are huge and buttery and won't break the bank.  This is the only donut shop that fills with your request of fillings.  What a great idea."}
{"text":"This place gets a five star from me!  Reminds me of a place back home in Erie PA only the size is so much bigger!! I tell everyone about this place."}
{"text":"This was one of the new places in my area. I decided to check it out....

My Donuts: I went around 3:30 PM, to my surprise there were not a lot of donuts to pick from (see video)... maybe  because it was near closing time (just guessing). My son had the regular maple which was REALLY GOOD!! I also had the strawberry crunch with filling and the Oreo with filling. All was good not great but good. I love how you get to pick your own filling 

Next visit: hopefully I get to try other flavors when they have more options. I will definitely go back 

Inside: small inside more like a lounge spot, it pretty cool. I can see my friends and I or my daughter and I going to hang out"}
{"text":"Yummy donuts and so fun to customize the fillings! The Bavarian cream was amazing and I don't typically enjoy cream filling. 

The staff was great and the inside was clean and cute. I enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"OMG is right on. Best donuts in Concord. Fresh & great selection. Super nice staff.  Only problem is that it is too convenient to my house"}
{"text":"Wow! Really fresh donuts, fillings inserted to order! Great place for donuts and coffee, inviting atmosphere!
Faye from Boston"}
{"text":"HOLY SHIT!  When I say these donuts are THEE BOMB??!   They are Huge... Soft.... Light...  Airy... and have absolutely NO Greasy aftertaste!  NONE!  ZERO!  OMG!   

I bought 18 donuts for $24.  I took 12 to the office.   all i heard was OMG.... OMG...  The other 6 were for the house but only 2 actually survived the trip back home soooo... yeah.   I suggest you put these in the trunk or else they may not make it to their destination.   You've been warned!

 The fat girl inside of me wishes OMG! would stay open later in the evenings.  That would prevent me from eating Dunkin Donuts.  But I declare that I will never eat Duck Donuts again!   (Krispy Kreme was never an option)"}
{"text":"I'm struggling to now see if OMG is my favorite rather than Duck Donuts. Awesome donuts"}
{"text":"My new favorite donuts in the area! The size of the donuts is great and the selection of flavors is almost overwhelming. My favorite part is the ability to pick your donut and filling to customize to your tastes. I love lemon filled and Boston Creme donuts and I am always able to make a good combination to fill my craving. My only complaint is I wish they were open longer hours. I love to have donuts for dessert so I have to make the effort to stop early on the weekends."}
{"text":"Being new to the Charlotte area and in dire need of a good donut fix, I began my search for an east coast alternative to a Randy's Donuts in LA or Voodoo Donuts in Portland. \"Dunkin' Donuts is the bomb!\" I was told. \"You'd probably really like Krispy Kreme..\" 
BLASPHEMY!
I think the fine folks here at OMG are on to something good. I enjoyed the selection of gourmet style donuts they had to offer but my heart races for the classics. They make a mean glazed donut and the vanilla frosted rainbow sprinkle almost made me giggle in delight. Let's see where this goes, so far it looks promising."}
{"text":"This was not one of my favorite donut spots by far. The donuts were very basic. They were not fresh..a lot of new donut places make your donuts hot and ready right in front of you so that can be hard to compete with. I will say the service was great and the donuts are large but they honestly looked and taste like something I would buy at the gas station."}
{"text":"I have been to Kristy Kreme (many times), I have been to Duck Donuts (good, but can be greasy), and I have even been to Voodoo Donuts in Portland,OR. None of them compare with OMG Donuts! The donuts are extremely fresh and fluffy, a great selection of creatively topped ones, and the option to custom fill donuts, including Long Johns! The glazed beat Krispy Kreme hands down--bigger, just as fresh, and less money! The staff is also very friendly and helpful. On top of all that, the coffee is excellent as well! There is even a kids corner where young kids can play while parents order breakfast! We will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"This place has apparently only been around for ~8 months or so, but their donuts are incredible! They're right next to the shopping area with Harley Davidson and BJs Wholesale Club, and a bit hidden away if you don't know where to look. Staff are very friendly, and I compare them to the likes of OBX's Duck Donuts...except this place is better because they're yeast donuts! Definitely will visit again and recommend to friends and family!"}
{"text":"I had no idea that OMG was so close to me. I've passed by this on the way to concord mills a million times. It's located behind a bunch of stuff so I'm assuming it does not receive the notoriety it deserves. 

Anywho, I arrived while one other person was in there so I was able to take my time and peruse the display case. There was not as much variety as I expected but enough for me. I chose a vanilla fruity pebble, original glaze, Oreo, Reese's and maple pecan. Half a dozen was $9.. it hurt the cheap place in my heart but my fat side was satisfied.

The doughnuts are thick, soft and yummy. I LOVEDD the Oreo doughnut and I will be going back for that one. They have a filling station with different flavors that I did not explore. If you're into that, it's available.

The employees are friendly and the space is clean. I definitely had a lot of excitement about going here and it did not quite meet the expectations I created in my head which may or may not be my fault but I still enjoyed my doughnuts. Give this place a try then walk it off in the mall!"}
{"text":"These doughnuts are very good. The only reason there are four instead of five stars is bc they have no cake doughnuts. Maybe they will in the future since they just opened. Either way, these doughnuts are large, light, flavorful, and affordable. I can't see a reason to go to DD or KK if you're close to this place. The store is clean and neat and the staff is pleasant. You can choose your fillings for your doughnuts and they have interesting toppings like strawberry shortcake, Oreo, and maple bacon."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm getting the Holy Ghost every time I am in here.  GOOD LAWD!!!! These donuts are sublime.  SUBLIME!  I've just tried the Boston Creme.  They fill it right in front of you.  It's delicious.  

I love the glazed donuts and typically get these.  They are 50% less fattening if you mash it down flat.  Less matter, less calories.  .  Scientific fact.  Lol.  

Please go to OMG, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The absolute best doughnuts you'll ever have, no joke! Everything is homemade and incredible. They have little machines that pump your doughnuts with filling right in front of you...anything from strawberry to mocha and several other flavors. Go for it!"}
{"text":"I rarely eat sweets, but today I tried OMG Donuts.  Now I am in love.  Two donut holes is plenty.  Super yummy."}
{"text":"OMG!!! What an awesome place. I got a plain doughnut and it was so good. I felt like the doughnut had just been made. If you like filling like raspberry  or Bavarian cream they will fill it for you right as you order. They have  apple fritters, eclairs and other pastries too. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"These donuts are actually too good!!!   If you want to lose weight, do not go here.  You will be dreaming of these delicious (and huge) donuts.  Good coffee and tons of options."}
{"text":"These are the best donuts in town. Nice little treat on Saturday morning to start the weekend off right."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd cry because of a donut. These donuts are truly remarkable. The cinnamon sugar twist donut made me feel like I was back in Greece eating a donut with my Pappou (grandfather) God rest his soul. The owners are so incredibly pleasant too. I've been twice in one week (yes my sweet tooth has been a bit out of control) I've been to the same businesses two in one week around Concord Mills. Anyways, I'll be back and I can't wait to try their coffee. My birthday is in June (yes, months away) and I'm thinking I'll ask for donuts. OMG is right... !"}
{"text":"I was so excited to find a donut boutique in Concord.  We recently moved from Richmond where donut shops with eclectic flavors have been a trend for years (Sugar Shack!!!), and we've been disappointed there was nothing like that in the Charlotte area.  Now there is!!!!
The decor is very minimalist, but who really stays to eat in a donut shop? The staff were happy and friendly. 

One thing that wowed us was that you can customize your fillings, and they will pipe it in in front of you.  I've never seen that before. 

We got a dozen.  A few standouts: the chocolate with vanilla icing in the center, the m&m's ones (with vanilla or chocolate icing), the strawberry with vanilla center, the Smores.  They were all light, fluffy, and decadent.  The chocolate used is super rich.  

My only feedback is they should have way more flavors, and switch them up weekly. They have a permanent menu board.  People love exotic flavored donuts.  It keeps them coming back.  

I was pleasantly surprised with this place, and will be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in today for the first time. I typically eat extremely healthy but my first job ever was working at a Greek diner/donut shop so I get excited to try to find donuts that can even come close to those fresh, mom & pop donuts. OMG's glazed are the closest to those awesome donuts of my memory. They were REALLY good. We also had an apple fritter and they are BIG and pretty good as well. I love that there was a sort of crust on the apple fritter and this place is the only place since the diner who has had that on a fritter. The chunks of apple were big and flavorful. I felt that the glaze was a bit too sweet for it but it was still  delicious. My husband had a large Kona coffee($1.65 for 16 oz cup) and said it was really good. The coffee is self serve and had 4 options. Sumatra, Kona, a French roast and a decaf Kona. 

The young girl who waited on us was really friendly and sweet. I asked to try a sample of the white cream filling and she was really nice about it. We will definitely be back but considering that I try to keep sweets to a minimum (Thank you middle age!! ) it won't be nearly as often as I would like."}
{"text":"Everything here was great, but the maple bacon was my favorite! They are not to sweet and the best part if you can pick you own filling for any doughnut!! 

P.S they have Vietnamese coffee!"}
{"text":"OMG is right!  So much better than any of the chains in the area!  

I used to work in a Shipley Donut in high school.  I've eaten donuts my entire life.  

These were fresh.  Tasty.  And I got to pick the filling in my chocolate covered.  Outstanding white cream!

Highly recommend to race car fans."}
{"text":"We stopped by here around 10 am on a Saturday morning and waited in the line with anticipation. I had my heart set on an apple fritter but they told me it would be a little wait until they had more. We were on our way out of town, so I didn't have time to wait. I opted for a long glazed donut with bavarian cream. My husband for a cookies and cream covered donut with fresh filling, as well. We both loved it our donuts and are excited to come back again! The negatives for me were them being out of the fritter and napkins (I think they just got caught in the rush and didn't have time to restock) but they were minor compared to the amazingly fresh and tasty donut!"}
{"text":"This little donut shop has it going on. They have a large variety of unique donuts along with Classics. My favorite here is the Apple fritters. Come early when they open and normally fritters still be hot."}
{"text":"No complaints here. We enjoyed every morsel!  This was our first visit. OMG is located close to the Great Wolf Lodge. We decided to try them out on our last day of vacation. So glad we did. The donuts are so good! We ordered vanilla icing with sprinkles, maple flavored icing with pecan topping, an apple fritter and a brownie."}
{"text":"I'm on my donut quest to find the best donuts in my area so I stopped by OMG Donuts and bakery to check out the goodness.

I came early enough to see fresh donuts being brought in from the back, and they looked scrumptious! 

I ordered half a dozen donuts so I could share them with the family and get their opinion! Well we all agree that the donuts are slightly larger than other donut shops, and they are fresh but they skimp on the toppings and the filling (which by the way wasn't even visible with six bites into the donut)! 
Oh yes and they charge more for the OMG selections; If I'm paying $1.55 for one doughnut there shouldn't be any skimping on the toppings! 

Over all the location was clean and the donuts are good, but a smile and a nice greeting in the morning would be very much appreciated!"}
{"text":"While I wasn't really impressed with the donut selection. From what I'm gathering they are known for the creams and jellies they fill them with and filled donuts aren't my thing. I will tell you that I haven't had a Cinamon Twist so good in a long time.  And I got a fritter for my mother in law and she went on and on about it for the rest of the morning. So based on it's close proximity to me and the dang on cinnamon twists, I will frequent often.  The gentleman ahead of me in line did warn me that I could become addicted..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The donuts are thick and super soft. They bake them throughout the day, so they are served super fresh. They have donuts that you can have filled with a filling of your choice. They also have other pastries like apple fritters (the best I've ever had) and brownies. The donuts are also very affordable."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best doughnuts I have had anywhere. So excited to have such an authentic place like this in Concord! Since visiting one week after their opening, I have stopped by 4 mornings on my way in to the office. My coworkers honestly beg me to stop more often! They prefer these doughnuts over any of the Charlotte shops. 

Please do not skip their coffee - I had the Sumatra roast yesterday and it was the perfect match with our 1/2 dozen. Quality coffee is hard to find in Concord so I am delighted to see their options (need to find out where the beans come from.) I am looking forward to trying their cold-brewed options soon. 

I always get there at opening (6:30), and have had to wait for them to bring out the doughnuts a couple times; but they seem to be getting better at having everything ready to go. I would stop more often if they would opened at 6:00 or 6:15; as 6:30 puts me in too much of a time crunch. The ladies running the show have always been kind and appreciative of my business. 

I am very impressed with the selection, quality and value this bakery provides. Prices are reasonable for the product. The doughnuts are large and simply delicious! I love supporting local businesses and this shop makes it so easy!"}
{"text":"My first visit here was not too impressive, many of their bakery products were all finished for the day. This was around 2:00pm So I have to come earlier another day hopefully to experience the cream filled goodness I have been reading about in the other reviews."}
{"text":"These are the best donuts we have ever had! We go here almost weekly to get a half dozen...my favorite is cinnamon sugar and my husband's favorite is s'mores."}
{"text":"The donuts are delicious, and with a very fast and friendly service I'd have to give this place an A+!"}
{"text":"Best donuts!  Great variety, including getting to pick your own filling.  The vanilla fruity pebble and maple pecan are my faves!  Becoming a weekend ritual. :)"}
{"text":"After indulging at bakeries that offer all kinds of exotic flavors in donut form, it's refreshing to enjoy something similar to our childhood. Not that it makes the choice any easier, however. OMG offers a nice selection of flavors and toppings. There are round and long donuts available for custom fillings, which I think is fun. I chose vanilla and chocolate this time, but I'll give the fruit fillings a shot in the future.

All the donuts were light, fluffy and sweet. Nothing heavy or oversized. The apple fritters looked tempting, and I overheard other patrons enjoying theirs, and I plan to do the same when I return. Great place, and surprisingly roomy for a bakery."}
