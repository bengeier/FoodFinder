{"text":"My wife and I came in for an early dinner about a week after the opening. The place looks great, the staff was friendly. The food was kind of hit or miss in places, but overall everything was good.

First up, if you're not drinking booze, I'm not sure they're quite prepared. The iced tea was barely more than lightly flavored water. I'm not sure if teas get refilled gratis...mine was never touched after I finished it about 3/4ths of the way through the meal.

We had a half order of the Monk Fries as an appetizer. This came out quickly, and was very tasty. The toppings were in good proportion to the volume of fries, which were well cooked. We're looking forward to trying some of the other options.

For the main meal, my wife had the standard cheeseburger. She was very pleased with it. She opted for a side salad instead of fries/chips, and had no complaints. 

I had the black and blue burger - I was really happy with it. The medium rare I requested was, indeed, served medium rare. There was plenty of cheese (a rare thing for a black&blue) and the bacon was flavorful. 

My side was tater tots - and these were probably the most disappointing part of my meal. They appeared to be fresh from the frier, but the centers were still ice cold.  

We thought about desert, but we were already taking leftovers home due to the generous portions. 

So...in summary:
The burgers are great. The monk fries are definitely worth trying. 
The problems we had with the meal we're willing to chock up to \"they just opened, give them a little time to find their rhythm.\" 

We're local, so we'll likely give them another try soon."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Any restaurant that offers cheescurds and tater tots as a side is fine by me. It has a sports bar atmosphere but is still great for families. The only reason for the four stars is poor service. But it had just opened so I'm sure they will iron out the wait staff and that will be just as excellent as the food."}
{"text":"Nice local chain bar/restaurant. Decent food and service. They always offer a dining coupon online and in local mailers. However you must print these off as they do not have the \"capability\" of redeeming these online. I'm not quite sure what this process is as it is a free coupon, but if you want to use them it must be done the old fashioned way."}
{"text":"The first time I came here it was on a Friday night, and even though the place was packed we were seated right away. 

I love the variety of dishes they have on the menu, from burgers and bar food to a decent selection of salads, to comfort foods like mac and cheese. I have been here several times now, and have tried multiple menu items, and each time the food was great. 

The service has always been great the few times we have been there. All of our servers have been helpful & accommodating, and the hosts/hostesses at the front of the restaurant have always been attentive and friendly. The servers we have had have always been willing to give great recommendations for the menu and make any changes to our order if anyone in our party had specific requests.

They have a decent beer menu (could have a few more options, maybe a few more local options, like Verona's Hop Haus.) but I would suggest getting their own ale, the \"47\". It has a great flavor, and pairs well with just about anything on the menu (if you're worried about that type of thing).

It's nice to have another restaurant option in Verona! Verona is growing and more and more options are becoming available to us finally, and it's fantastic."}
{"text":"Come see the staff here... It's the atmosphere that makes the place.  Food is standard bar food but the staff makes the grade here.  Josh, John and Greg we're introducing themselves to many different patrons. Nice change.  Make people feel welcome."}
{"text":"Tonight was my second time at this location. Both times, the food was very good. Although it was busy, we were seated quickly and the service was very prompt. They have a decent draft beer selection, and even more in bottles. The restaurant is very clean and modern. I had the Santa Fe chicken wrap without the ranch. I really enjoyed it! The avocado in the wrap was enough to make it creamy without the heavy ranch dressing. My husband had the pulled pork sandwich. All very good. I would go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Picked up a Cobb salad at Monks in Verona since it's right by my work. I love all of monk's food but I especially love getting my salads from there especially for takeout! They separate the chicken which is great so it doesn't get the lettuce soggy and they used mixed greens instead of iceberg which just makes it feel like a better quality salad overall. Plus their ranch is made in house and is one of my favorites. Once you have Ranch made from scratch it's hard to go back to Kraft!"}
{"text":"For what it is, I'm giving it five stars. 

When I heard Monk's was coming to Verona (I've been to their Middleton location) I was wondering if Verona really needs another bar/burger place. And the while answer is no, Monk's delivered above expectations and is now one of the better local options for casual pub food and drink. And this was during their first week after opening, let's hope the consistency holds!

The pros: although the scope of the menu is limited (sandwiches, wraps, salads, etc) there are lots of options to choose from, and when I go back I'll have something else I'll want to try. Portion sizes were VERY generous, you will definitely leave full (or with a to go box). The service was great, especially considering it was the opening week and the place was packed. There are lots of TVs with good views from every seat, and the decor has finally been updated to something modern after many previous restaurants trying to make do with the same tacky furnishings (if you're familiar with the location, you know what I mean).

Cons (and I'm being picky here): the tap beer selection is too limited, I hope they will offer a few more beers that will make it easier for me to hang out with friends and enjoy a beverage while watching some games (gentle suggestion, it would be awesome if they could bring in some brews from Hop Haus Verona!). The other knock against the menu--I upgraded to \"Monkey fries\" because it sounded interesting, but in the end the added cheese sauce just made the fries soggy.

TLDR, Monk's looks like it will finally beat the curse of failed restaurants at this location! Solid pub food, now they just need to bring in a few more tap beers!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for just some drinks and snack,  The reason I mark 4 star is just because I did not really dine here.

We had a couple of beers and a screw driver.  The bartender was very friendly and nice and cheerful.  The food was fresh and good.

My wife and I really enjoyed the place and definitely go back in near future."}
{"text":"Monk's is a very loud sports bar. I went on a busy Friday night and we waited about 15 minutes to be seated. They estimated 20-30 minutes so we were happy with the 15 minute wait. They have a ample seating in the waiting area, so that's nice. We were seated on the edge of the bar and it was very loud! The food was good enough but nothing exceptional. I actually prefer Culver's burgers and cheese curds. I'd maybe go back for drinks and appetizers.

Tip: The waiter didn't ask how we'd like our burgers cooked so if you have a strong preference, remember to tell them!"}
{"text":"Went for the Impossible Burger and it did not disappoint! My only complaint is that the bun is not vegan also. I ate the burger with no bun because of this--I would love to have the full burger experience and enjoy the bun as well. Josh (at the bar) was very attentive and seemed very excited that the vegan option was available. Overall, I enjoyed my experience and the food--I'm going back for lunch today!"}
{"text":"I don't get the name.
Like, I really wanted this to be a Trappist restaurant with beer brewed by men of the cloth or something, and ooh! What if all the food was served by guys in vestments or something? And they chanted while you ate? That would be cool. Maybe a little sacrilegious, but it's not like it's Hooters or something, right?

Whatever.

This is a run-of-the-mill sports bar. The food is run-of-the-mill.  The drinks are run-of-the-mill. The service is run-of-the-mill.

DUDE! What about a mill-themed bar? Like in a foundry or something and you could grind your own grain to make your burger bun or the like.

Dammit, I'm a genius. Get on that, Michelle."}
{"text":"I was really hoping for a great burger joint in Verona. Sadly, Monk's does not fill the void. Sure there a re some interesting choices. But the meat to bun ratio is so lacking in the meat department, that all you can taste is bread. Granted, you can get an additional patty. But I just didn't think the food was worth the price."}
{"text":"When my husband and I were deciding what kind of takeout to get, and as a vegan household, our options are super limited, he thought to search area restaurants for any that served the Impossible Burger (we've been wanting to try it for a while). We've never been to Monk's but when we saw they offer this I-can't-believe-it's-not-burger option, we had to try it and boy, was it life-changing. No really. It's been almost 2 years since I've had meat and switched my diet to no animal products and biting into this burger took me back. I thought it was a real beef burger. Smells like one, looks, like one, tastes like one. We are going to be regular customers now!!! Thank you so so so much for bringing this burger to Verona and offering an alternative to beef. These are definitely the burgers of the future!! Give them a try if you haven't and thanks for cooking it well with some tasty fries!"}
{"text":"If I watched sports, I'd want to watch them here. Everywhere you look there's a TV screen, literally the only place they don't have a screen is in the men's room. I don't know if I could watch TV while I'm doing my business. Anyways, food was solid. I had the burger and fries; fast friendly service."}
{"text":"The monster burger is probably the best burger  I've ever had.  I would definitely recommend it. The fries were ok. A little soggy. Maybe choose the chips if you want crispy. The California chicken sandwich was good but quite small for the price. When the chicken filet is half the size of the bun, it's too small.  If you drink water Bring your own because it's so bad here we could not drink it. Swimming pool comes to mind. The chocolate chip cookie dessert was good."}
{"text":"Manager needs training in customer service practices. He was happy to give our party a hard time over a 3-day expired coupon. It would have been one thing if he stated the policy, but instead he said it was impossible to do a manager override to accept the coupon, which he later admitted was not true. The problem lies within the untruthful explanation.  Poor manager service at this location, would not recommend. Our waitress was great, however."}
{"text":"My husband and 2 kids went here on a Friday night to check out the new Monk's. It was very clean and the staff was courteous, our server Kent was great! I had the 'it's all Gouda burger' and my husband had the chicken tender wrap, both were delicious. Huge portions and piles of fries. My only complaint is about the children's menu. We paid $6.00 for a kids meal, not including a drink. Both kids ordered a lemonade which came in a small covered kids cup, we paid $2.50 per drink. The kids meal was now $8.50. Come on Monks, that price is a little steep. All in all, great food and service, but the kids menu needs some changes!"}
{"text":"We ordered spicy cauliflower appetizer that came out cold. How do you get a battered and deep fried appetizer that was like warm in minutes- my guess -everything fried is previously fried and baked or microwaved to warm up. My entree was a buffalo chicken wrap. Same situation with the breaded chicken - cold and dry like an old chicken finger that was warmed up. My friend ordered the brisket sandwich also with cold meat and dry cold and old tasting onion petals. They charged us 50 cents a piece for extra sauce which was really needed for the fries which also seemed not freshly fried and dry. This place either has money problems or lazy cooks- skip this place for very underwhelming food."}
{"text":"Eat there once had the mac-cheese and chicken strips it was wonderful .  Will go back soon"}
{"text":"Our waitress Crystal may have been the rudest waitress I've ever had. I had a problem with my burger (it was super well done I asked for medium rare). When I informed her of this she simply said \"oh, sorry about that\" and walked away. Didn't offer to get me a new one or anything. I later asked to speak with the manager (she said he wasn't available, looked real snotty and walked off). I paid the bill and left, I won't be going back there again. Other then that the appetizers we're great and the atmosphere was nice. To bad one bad employee can ruin an experience for me and my friends."}
{"text":"This is the fourth Monk's location we have dined at over the years. Being the newest it lacks the charm of the downtown Dell's original location. We were in the Verona area and decided to stop in for lunch. 

It was pretty quiet on a Thursday afternoon. The staff were all friendly and the service good.  I ordered the Gouda burger and it was excellent.  The chipotle mayo gave it a nice kick. The bun was super fresh and soft. It really made the burger. The taco salad was just okay- nothing special. The prices were pretty typical for a Wisconsin tavern-like restaurant. 

Not sure how busy this place is on weekends but I would return for a burger."}
{"text":"Passed by many times but this time we stopped. Service was good, waitress friendly. We just had a appetizer but was very filling and the drinks were refreshing"}
