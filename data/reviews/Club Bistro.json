{"text":"Survives by the convenience factor and lack of competition.  It is overpriced and quality has been fastidiously trimmed to the bare minimum - in freshness of produce, quality of meat, filler to substance ratio, lack of pricier ingredients or accoutrements that you would expect, etc.  Not sure what's up with their choices in bread either.  They use Breadworks but then choose the wrong type of bread - not sandwich friendly bread - it's weird.  It is convenient and not bad enough to avoid on principle."}
{"text":"Horrendous restaurant... Overpriced, mediocre food. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"A hidden jem within SoPointe. Homemade sandwiches and fresh toppings galore. Clean, fresh and plenty of sides to choose from. A great American/Greek style shop. I love the favor the foods have. Not your cookie cutter chain= Family owned. Open for Breakfast but have not tried yet. The chicken & portobello sandwich wa very tasty & filling."}
{"text":"Great food and able to cater on short notice. I get great compliments on the food. The delivery driver is very kind."}
