{"text":"Really good sandwiches, friendly service
even though it's not full service, word of advice, eat it on a table, take out in the park means a lot of the toppings are being squeezed out into the wrapper...good thing I have no shame and didn't let any of it go to waste!  Messy sandwich means good sandwich!"}
{"text":"Muy sabroso, los precios accesibles y de buen tamaño las tortas. Yo he comido las de cochinita y la de milaneza y las dos deliciosas. Tienen el sabor de México."}
{"text":"It was rather disappointing for the price point and hype. Had the pablana torta which was not good, it had a pasty/mealy texture (you would never know its chicken) and the flavour was quite bland. Also had the del chavo torta which was much better with flavourful ham and nicely melted cheese, the optional pickled jalapeños made it good. their hot sauce is adobe which is stupid because the smokey flavour doesnt go with most of the sandwich options. For the price point, however, I still didn't think it was worth it. The elotes were terrible, water-logged corn from sitting in hot water bath for too long, queso and spices were not enough to save it... again, for $4.75 it was such a rip off and a disappointment. 
The torta bread itself is the best thing about the place (love Blackbird bakery). 

Will not recommend to anyone, not worth it."}
{"text":"This is what a torta taste like! Is not a sandwich - you gotta first know that, so don't expect the bred to be \"toasted\" cause it shouldn't be, someone mentioned below that they should use some pickles... why? Tortas don't have pickles traditionally.... also the churros are delicious and the amount of sugar is how it is supposed to be! This is your traditional torta and if you have ever been to Mexico and tried one you will know that. Also, I don't find it pricey, the meat needs to be prepped and is not as easy as it looks, it not your typical torontonian sandwich place where they use prepacked meat and throw it there. You gotta know also that this bread is probably specially made for this restaurant, I have never been able to find the telera bread in Canada, this for sure adds to the price, but completely worth it, it is the best torta in town!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite sandwich place in Toronto. Unique sandwiches that are reasonably priced and DELICIOUS. I love sitting at the bar by the window and people-watching. I've taken a few friends here over the past year and they all love it. Would highly recommend to anyone needing a bite to eat in Kensington!"}
{"text":"There was no line-up to order when I arrived on a Friday evening and quite a few empty seats.  Ordered a combo of the Cubana sandwich w esquites, to go.  

My timing was perfect, as there was no one waiting to pick-up, and a group came in to order right after me.  Took about 10 minutes to pick up my order, and there was a line up to the door when I left.

The sandwich was good, but nothing out of this world, esp. at $12.  The bun was over toasted at the ends which fell off like a cracker, at first bite.  Definitely a messy sandwich.  The side of esquites ($4 in a combo) was good;  kinda like having mexican street corn, without having to deal withe the cob.  They let you choose either crema or mayo as topping;  crema all the way!!

Overall, I would say the tortas I've had at King's Tacos (impatiently waiting for them to re-open at their new location) are better, in my opinion.  

One plus is that they take credit card!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.   I was excited to see this place in Kensington, and have been wanting to try it a few times.  I have been here twice now.  The first time I went I got a sandwich (The Pepito) and I have to say it was waaaaaaay too salty.  Almost inedible too salty.  We washed it down with a nice refreshing Horchata which was nice.  My second visit I ordered churros.  They were taking awhile, so I walked across the street and ordered Moo Frites.  After ordering, waiting, and receiving my order for Moo Frites I walked back over to Torteria San Cosme and the churros were surprisingly STILL not ready.   We had to get going, and we let them know and asked for them in a to go container.   The churros suddenly appeared.  They were hot and fresh and not bad tasting.  They are served with a caramel type sauce, that didn't seem to go all that well with the churros.  The churros themselves were good.  The owner does seem very nice, but so far I haven't had a great dining experience here."}
{"text":"The Tortas are really good but the place is a bit pricey and you end up questioning whether the torta was worth it for this price. If they were a bit cheaper, I would definitely would have given a 5/5."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch on a Saturday. It was quite busy but turn over was quick so don't get intimidated by the crowded patio. 

We ordered a huevero, cubana and some churros.
Here is where it gets tricky: whether you would like these sandwiches depends on what you like about sandwiches. I found that the bread was too soft (I.e  not sufficiently toasted) and that combined with the ingredients in the huevero made that sandwich lack texture. It was also rather bland. The cubana was rescued partially by  the pork but also insufficiently roared and could have used a pickle. Finally, the churros were way overseasoned with sugar. However they do make a good hot chocolate."}
{"text":"Ordered Pollo Con Mole. Sandwich was fine if a little overpriced at $11+. Bread from the bakery is nice, but I was left with bread and sauce on a couple of bites - a little more chicken would have been nice especially for the price. I had to wait 15 minutes for my sandwich even though it wasn't particularly busy. The biggest problem I could see is that they only have room on the griddle for one cook, even though there are 4 or 5 other staff milling about not doing a whole lot. Not entirely sure I would return again considering the cost and wait time. I could be persuaded otherwise."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican sandwiches.

Had the vegetarian one 4/5
Had the pollo mole 4.5/5"}
{"text":"A corrido song on the background

Santo Cosme......

A good experience starts the moment you walk in.

Music they nailed it. Brings up the energy. 

The tortas are great but the assembly stills need a street touch and a more bold ingredients dynamic presence. The cooks need some more vibe they too shy. Street food is about the show.

Street fare gets as funky as the vendor stays longer on the market. It really represents a craft where the torta or taco along with the food master feel like a single entity genuine to its purpose. 

Little things make for big outputs....

Will come back in 4 months to see the transformation.

My advise to the owner: You got a street food establishment dont you? Make your staff yell at each other like they mean in Spanish.

 This will add so much energy.... just walk in to Guu Izakaya you will get my point."}
{"text":"Ordered the pepito torta, esquites, and a cup of horchata.  Would recommend skipping the thin, dry beef of the pepito, and opting for the pork dishes instead which looked a lot better.

I didn't find the esquites to be particularly flavourful, and they seemed to be seeping out a lot of liquid (the kind that typically comes from canned veggies).  The horchata was pretty heavy on the cinnamon, which I liked.

I didn't hate this place, but I can't really find a particularly good reason to come back, either."}
{"text":"Best Tortas I ever had in a long long time.
As Mexican is hard to find authentic Mexican food in Canada. This is exactly as the best Tortas place in Mexico. The quality of ingredient was excellent.
I had Torta Cubana and my wife Torta de Milanesa.
I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Torteria San Cosme took me by surprise! It's a game of deception really... All the pictures made the sandwich look nice and big and mouthwatering. But when we got our order, it was much smaller (still mouthwatering) - wonk wonk :P  But but but... Once we finished our meal, I was so freakin full (and it tasted Amazing), I needed to walk it off. 

I have passed by TSC a few times already after a few visits to Kensington for some other food trekking. So when a friend said she wanted to try this place, I gladly tagged along for our office Fat Friday lunch. We got in after 1pm and the place wasn't so busy. It was bright and clean with lots of seating.

We ordered and split the sammies:
- Pepito (steak). OMG! It's eye-openingly Yummy! Everything was seasoned well.
- Cubano. How can you go wrong with pork on pork on pork.
- Esquites. I love esquites cuz I'm too lazy to eat the elotes, and TSC does them right.
We were planning to get some churos after but like I said... We were crazy full.

The price point is a bit high for Kensington so I can't give them full stars. But I am definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu.

4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Having been to Central America, I ate several Tortas and when I came here, it brought back some memories. The line moved quite quickly and in an organized fashion.  I ordered the Cubana sandwich. It took about 10 minutes to be prepared.  The sandwich was very tasty each made with a delicious combination of ingredients, but for the $13 price point, I think you could get better value elsewhere. The sandwich was not very big and actually had to go somewhere after to fully satisfy my hunger."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat at Kensington Market and decided on this spot because of an article we saw. 

We got the cochinita (pulled pork, elote, and one of the sandwiches that came with meatballs (i forgot the name).  The cochinita was SO GOOD, I would definitely recommend it! The pulled pork was cooked very nicely and the flavor was amazing. My boyfriend ate the meatball one, which was just okay. It's nothing special, I would recommend the cochinita or trying something else on the menu. 

The elote, in my opinion, wasn't that great. The corn didn't taste like it was cooked at all, and it lacked any flavor other than the cheese. Usually I'm all for elote, but I wouldn't get this again."}
{"text":"When I'm always at Kensington Market, I always see this place filled with people on the corner of Baldwin and Kensington. I finally came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was still packed when I arrived around 2pm. 

It is an interesting place as the decor really gives it a Mexican street vendor vibe. I ordered the Pepito sandwich which contained steak in it. It took a while to make the sandwich (roughly 8 minutes) and they called my number when it was ready. Seats may be hard to find and it is only stool seating. The washroom is not part of their restaurant so they recommend you use it at your own risk.

At first, the sandwich did not look too appealing. But after one bite, they convinced me that it is one tasty sandwich. The steak meat was seasoned perfectly and it pairs well with the panela cheese and guacamole. I love the taste of the sautéed onions and the uniqueness of the bread really puts the sandwich together. Overall, it exceeded my expectations. 

I definitely will be back one day when I am passing thru Kensington Market and try a different sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a good sammy and this place is serving them up! 

I went with the Cochinita. So Good you guys. I can never turn down really good pulled pork- and this was just that. I was starving when i went here and I was so full when I left just from having this one sandwich. 100% worth the 10.50 price tag.

Also this place is the bessst for people watching. Huge windows on the corner looking into the market. I'm not a creep it's just fun to see who's out and about! 

Love this new addition to Kensington- Totally coming back for seconds."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while and finally ducked in for lunch with a friend.

My first thought was - this place is beautiful! Bright colours on the walls, beautiful tiled floor - it reminded me of Cuba. I normally don't care about the aesthetic of the place but this one really stuck out to me.

Food - I ordered the cochinita - pulled pork with fried plantains and refritos - so incredibly juicy, and the fried plantains didn't make the sandwich greasy at all. My friend ordered the nopales sandwich which had a serious kick to it!

We also got the paitas con chile on the side - because all sandwiches should be eaten with chips. The papitas were good but I wish the hot sauce was hotter.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place isn't good for take out. The tortas took a while to make and when I opened them they looked thrown together. The flavors were okay. Nothing spectacular. I had the cubana and milanesa. The ham on the cubana was dry and overall it was salty. The saving grace were the avocados. I will be going back to give this place another chance. I think it would be better to dine in. It's a beautiful restaurant on the corner with big windows that allow you to see people outside."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. 
Kid friendly atmosphere (though it's all bar seating). 
I personally love the rice milk drink, very refreshing. 
Will have to give all their sandwiches a try; a big list to finish off. 
The servers are fairly helpfull and friendly."}
{"text":"I got the steak sandwich, bread was really nice and good amount of avocado and caramelized onions. I also really liked the fried cheese on it. The refried beans also added to the creamyness of the sandwich. Overall, pretty tasty but I do think this place is overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the older lady behind the cash taking orders was rude and dismissive. I came here on a lunch date and she yelled at me when I asked for water. I was mortified. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"Randomly wandered into this place in Kensington Market and ordered the Pepitas Torta which was a steak sandwich with avocado and caramelized onions. Amazing. My mouth is watering just writing this! Will definitely be back! Cool, busy vibe as well."}
{"text":"A solid Cubana torta. Meat was tender and decent flavor. Bacon was a bit fatty for me. Definitely needed the chipotle and then the avocado and tomato to balance. Wish it was a little more traditional style with pickles but I get the direction they were going. Love the Mexican Squirt Soda in glass bottles."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place because it looks very authentic. I ordered the cochinita, and my boyfriend ordered the Milanesa. For the cochinita, the meat was seasoned well, but it seemed like they skimped on all the other ingredients. There were barely any pickled onions, and they put all but two small plantains on the entire sandwich (which was fairly large). The texture of the torta was nice and fluffy, but it still seemed like it was lacking something... it definitely could have used more flavor. I also got the elotes, which fell flat for me. The corn itself tasted off, and the cheese was a bit too sour for me. I was expecting a warm, cheesy, flavorful elote, but the flavor was....unpleasant. As for the Milanesa, I didn't taste much seasoning at all. I was hoping to use some hot sauce to spice up the flavor, but the \"hot sauce\" they had was essentially just salsa, and not spicy at all. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a colourful Mexican eatery in Kensington Market that doesn't do tacos!! The interior feels like an outdoor Mexican street food stall. 

I've been several times and never had a bad sandwich (torta) here ever!! The Milanesa ($10.25) has breaded chicken and manchego cheese, the Pepito ($10.50) has a  seared flat iron steak with panela. My favourite is the Cubana ($10.50) with smoked ham and adobo pork with melted gouda and topped with sliced avocado, tomatoes, chipotle sauce and spicy dijon. While it's not the Miami style Cuban you may expect, it's still a tasty alternative!! 

They have imported Mexican soft drinks and aguas frescas - various house made flavoured drinks."}
{"text":"2.5*

A lot pricey for just a sandwich. They are made fresh which I like, but it also takes a long time and the tortas are like... not unexpectedly delicious.  They are actually exactly what is expected of a torta but marked up by 30%.

It's not bad... but I really question the people who think that a 12$ torta was one of the best things they experienced in life...."}
{"text":"Delicious Huevo sandwich.  Definitely different than other breakfast sandwich and so delicious with the eggs cooked in tomato meat sauce with chorizo and bacon goodness! Superb and so filling. I packed half to go!"}
{"text":"Not good. The pulled pork was sloppy and too hot with no flavor. There was supposed to be plantain, but all I could find was one slimy piece in the corner of the sandwich. The bread was hard. The corn was over cooked and not grilled...with a funny taste..like it had been in the steamer for 3 days. And the music!!! It was SO LOUD we couldn't carry on a conversation. I was looking for lunch, not a dance party. We asked them to turn it down and they did for 5 minutes and then jacked it back up. Won't be back. Gross place."}
{"text":"best tortas in toronto. I am mexican and these tortas tastes exactly as they taste in a mexican torteria. Ask for a pepito"}
{"text":"I've recently stopped by here in the past month and gotten some food and both experiences weren't great. The food is incredibly overpriced but super low quality. I picked up some chips and guacamole, I paid $6 and I barely got any guac. They gave me a small sandwich bag full of chips too. 
I decided to try again and snagged an elote. I paid $7 for something I couldn't even eat. the corn cob was smaller than my hand. The kernels were so hard, it was inedible and there was hardly any toppings on it. It was so disappointing and gross. I contacted the restaurant about it and they never responded. I'd say just save your money and don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Amazing food served up quick with somewhat steep prices (maybe it was the USD to CAD conversion though). Ordered the Pepito with a side of elote and a michelada. A previous reviewer noted that the (cheese?) was sour on the elote. The elote was sour, but my experience was that the sourness came from the added lime, which was certainly expected."}
{"text":"They are built over the grave of the late Kensington's.

Essentially what Melissa F. said. 
The food is not bad. But it sure isn't great either. Average I would say. 
It tastes exactly how it looks. 

Pricey for just a sandwich (it should have a side, like seriously, anything. Lay's potato chips. Just... something)

They are made fresh. Takes a while. 
They don't call out your order number that loud so you need to be on your toes. 

That being said, they're still better than what Kensington's became."}
{"text":"Loved the bread..had a breakfast style thing it was huge...almost too busy in terms of follings salsa avocado cheese egg spice sausage ham bacon and potato seems a bit more than what i may have been looking for. It would be fair to say the portion is ample as it was very shareable.  I'd go back but maybe try something less everything"}
{"text":"This place has seriously pretty decor and the hand painted signs on the windows is a typography lovers dream. The bright mural on the wall is also amazing. The whole place is bright and colourful and the large windows are great for people watching.

Came here on a weekday night around 6.30pm, it was fairly quiet only 2-3 other people eating. But other times I walk by and it looks busy. I got the poblana sandwich ( I cant resist mole and cotija cheese) The serving size was good, felt a bit expensive. But the bread was nice and crunch, there was a good amount of chicken and the mole was nutty, and cheese is always good.

The staff were nice and the front counter has lots of mexican candies and snacks for sale. Its a great addition to kensington market!"}
{"text":"Food is 5
Price is 2
Service is 2

The tortas themselves were really good. However they took 35 minutes to make 1. That's insane!!!! My cactus torta with cheese and eggs was $17. That's a bit steep for a Mexican burger. Much better snackier options available in the area. Just walk and explore a little."}
{"text":"The food is good, but all the portions are now smaller. Drink cups are packed with ice, and then filled well short of the brim. The pickled peppers are now by request only, and the portions smaller. It's good, but it use to be better. Now you get less for more."}
{"text":"Nice but not amazing...Nice tortas. Not very expensive.
The tortas are good but its not an amazing place."}
{"text":"Hours said 7...
Walked in at 545, rude girl yelled something about not coming in.. Music so loud couldn't make it out, another guy mumbled something about being closed. 
Bad experience. Waste of time."}
{"text":"Giving this place 4 stars based off of the service; when I walked in I was standing at the register for over 2 minutes before a man directly behind the counter acknowledged me, he seemed to be very out of it. I noticed one woman was waiting for a very long time and she asked them about her order and they seemed to be confused because it got lost amongst everything so they were very disorganized. After I placed my order the worker showed me the iPad so I could select a tip and I selected the highest available, 15% but kind of regret it because no employees acknowledged me, the food took awhile to come out and I brought all my dishes back up to the counter to be washed so no \"serving\" was really going on at this restaraunt. I was very excited to eat here because I love elotes so I ordered that and tried the esquites too, both were very delicious. My boyfriend had the cubana sandwich and was very pleased with that and said it was very delicious, so the food did not disappoint only the service did."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with my last visit. I ate here about 4 or 5 times over a couple months when it first opened and was BLOWN away. I was really excited to be in the area again so I could have San Cosme. I ordered my usual Albondigas torta and Jamaica drink. I was disappointed with my very first bite. I noticed that the albondiga (meatball) was no longer a thick slice, that it was so thin, about 1/4 inch thick only. The avocado slice was non-existent and practically disintegrated into the bread because the slice was so thin. I always looked forward to the avocado in this sandwich because it contrasted so nicely with the sauce and chiles. This brings me to the sauce. There was none. There was so little that the whole torta was dry. When this place first opened the sauce and juices in this sandwich would run down my hands. I was so incredibly disappointed this time. I didn't even finish. Now that the word is out and it's gained popularity, it has decided to cut corners by being skimpy with their ingredients. So disappointing. I will not be back and I will stop recommending this place to friends."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of tortas. Other than the food being slightly too sugary, I have no complaints. The problem is the cost. At over $12 for a small sandwich (no sides or drink included) that won't fill you up, I can't justify coming here again. I'll come back if they lower their prices to $8 or so for a sandwich, which is far more reasonable. This is Kensington market. There are loads of great places that don't charge nearly as much."}
{"text":"Just read through some of the reviews that were left here about San Cosme and I'm honestly a little shocked. Perhaps I came in with lower expectations, so I ended up coming out of it quite a happy camper!

My boyfriend was meeting some friends for lunch so I had to make my own lunch plans. I had seen this place open not too long ago through my Kensington strolls, and noticed the colourful interior through the large windows wrapping around the restaurant.

Upon entering, I couldn't take my eyes off the rainbow of colours coming off of different coloured soda cans, Mexican candies, and drinks. I was pretty overwhelmed by the menu because there were a lot of words that I couldn't exactly decipher on my own. Not to worry though, the staff were plenty pleasant and willing to assist me. 

I ordered the huevo torta - it was around lunch time but I hadn't had breakfast yet so this fit the bill (think scrambled eggs, bacon, chorizo, avocado, cheese tomato). I was in awe at how delicious it was! It was greasy side (I think it was the huge slab of melty cheese... yummm...), but the flavours worked so well together and the grease probably added to it... some bacon and chorizo juice dripping down your sandwich never hurt nobody ;)

The portions were also huge and the huevo was quite filling, only ate half and packed the other half for the bf to try.

Ambience: 4/5
Cost: 3.5/5
Food: 5/5
Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"Seriously?! Almost $13 for this pathetic looking and not-great tasting sandwich. Not to mention I paid extra for avocado which I discovered they forgot once I got home. Totally ruined my evening."}
{"text":"This place consistently has a small line inside; likely due to them making the sandwiches to order. It takes awhile. Don't expect to come in and have your sandwich ready in a few min.

The times I've been here, I've enjoyed the meat and bun. I'm definitely not a mexican sandwich expert but the flavours are always enjoyable, fresh, and a good experience overall. Would recommend checking this out as I'm not sure where else you can find these in downtown."}
{"text":"This place makes a good sandwich in beef, pork, and other varieties. It is definitely worth a try. Of the dozen or so Mexican/quasi-Mexican places in Kensington Market, you will find yet another wrinkle here.

San Cosme also offers a bit of new and trendy raz-ma-taz to a Kensington Market that has grown a bit tired of late. Actually, quite a bit tired.

While the sandwich is good, add a Coke and you're at $16.39. No chips or nothing else included. What adds insult to injury is that when you pay with a credit card, you are immediately given options to make a 15, 20, or 25% tip or other. Well, you wait in line to order, get your own napkins, and clear your own plate. There is no service. Why force people to choose \"other\" and type in zero or some other amount when your are not giving service? 

I realize there are plenty of people in Toronto with money to burn. Yet feeling pressured into a 15% or more tip with no service is a bit much. There are lots of other places in Kensington Market where you can have a good and more substantive lunch for less than 20$."}
{"text":"I had the Pulled Pork sandwich and Tamarind fruit juice. It was very satisfying and filling. Induced a food coma. They did not skimp on the meat, it actually drips down your fingers so be prepared. The Tamarind juice was just right. I am not a fan of sandwiches but this was good. The bread was just right . I will go back to try the rest.

Seating is around a table and they have purse hooks. Very nice."}
{"text":"As part of a Kensington Market food tour, we stopped at this street food shop where our guide ordered cactus tortas for us!  NOPALES consists of Cactus, panela cheese, refritos, avocado, and salsa verde and shockingly was quite good especially adding a very little bit of their hot pepper sauce on top. Just in case, we had a milk-based drink to wash it down.  The torta was warm and soft, and went well with the fresh contents.  We didn't miss having meat in the sandwich, it was so good and filling."}
{"text":"Amazing food, well worth a try. You feel like you're on vacation in Mexico. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are very unique since Mexican sandwich places are not very common.  I have only been here two times. The sandwiches were better on my first visit then my second visit.  The sandwiches were so good on my first visit, I returned again the next week, however during that visit I found sandwich filling to be very sparse and all I tasted was bread."}
{"text":"Walked by today for late lunch. I got the COCHINITA PIBIL (Tangy pork, refritos, habanero onions, plaintains) and Jamaica (hibiscus blossom) drink. The sandwich was wonderful. I got take out and it lasted until I got home. The plaintains were cooked nicely and the pork was seasoned well. Bread is buttered and grilled, so it's toasted and crunchy. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great place, food is delicious and the personal very nice. A good place to grab some food and continue exploring the hood! The only bad thing is that you can't get a beer to pair it with the tortas."}
{"text":"If you're looking for tortas in the area this place is okay. I had the adobada torta and the meat was well cooked and the bread was crispy, however, I felt that the meal lacked overall flavor. I also got elotes which was just 'aight'. The reason why I give it three stars is because I wouldn't want to come here again. It was just good and thats it, which is why I was disappointed. 

Do I recommend trying the place out. Yes. But is it worth the drive? Perhaps not."}
{"text":"So I know nothing about how a torta is supposed to be, but these were pretty decent. I went with my beau, and we got a good variety of things: one cactus torta, one steak torta, a Caesar salad, the beans, and the corn in a bowl. He had the jamaica agua fresca, as is his wont. We had churros. The best things: steak torta, beans, corn in a bowl, and churros. These things I would order again. The other two, despite the novelty of eating cactus, I would not get again. The salad was so salty as to be inedible. The cactus torta was also too salty. Note: I am a salt fiend. The jamaica agua fresca was watery. 

The churros - man, these were good. They were a crispy, less doughy kind, and there was a bit of caramel on the side for dipping - not enough, in my opinion. 

The beans were nice and smoky and seemed to be cooked with some bacon and tomatoes. The corn is lime-y, and there's a bit of cheese and a slight spicy kick. The corn is served in a bit of liquid, which might not be everyone's thing, but I found it tasty. 

Steak torta: guac, cheese, fried steak - what's not to love? 

If you get the good stuff, it's more like a 4/5. If you factor in the stuff I didn't like as much, it's more of a 3/5.

It's counter service. Staff are quite friendly, and it's colourful inside - a nice change in tone from Kensington's (the coffee shop that used to be at that spot), and a nice addition to the neighbourhood. But be warned: it may be pretty hot inside. It was 18º outside when we went, and it was an oven in San Cosme. Bathrooms are shared with Dirty Bird; they are (predictably?) dirty, stinky, etc. But I've seen way worse."}
{"text":"Best horchata in town !! I live in Richmond Hill and I travel all the way downtown just to have their horchata ! It never disappoints."}
{"text":"Muy buenas tortas, casi se sienten como en México, aunque el pan no sea exactamente una telera el sabor se parece mucho.
Está un poco caro para lo que es y la verdad las \"papas\" con guacamole dejan un poco que desear.
Lo peor son los baños, el día que fui estaban asquerosos y solo por eso dan ganas de no regresar.
La mejor torta es la de milanesa."}
{"text":"i've only been once to torteria san cosme, but i still remember what a great sandwich i had. it's great to have a non-taco place in kensington. looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"Wow what a treat! I'm always looking for authentic Mexican food and this is very very close. Definitely the best torta I've had in Canada. I ordered the Pepito, a steak sandwich with beans, guacamole and a slab of panela cheese. The bread was crusty but not dry, the steak flavourful and tender. The creaminess of the guac and beans did a good job of balancing the textures of the bread and beef. And the beans were spot on - they tasted just like my dad's (i.e real Mexican cooking). What a nice balance of flavours, though my sandwich could've used some lime and hot sauce haha.

All in all a great spot for a great meal. I'll be back and I'll be recommending this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Came here purposely to tr the churos. Came here around 1:30pm on Sat and was crowded. Took about 10 mins for the churros (guess they were focus on making sandwiches more). It was freshlt made, tasted good but I had better. Quite expensive for the few pieces."}
{"text":"Right in the heart of Kensington Market, this Mexican sandwich place gives off a cool 50s diner vibe. Got the Cubana which has meat, meat, and more meat, namely smoked ham, adobo pork, and bacon. It also has chipotle, avocado, and tomato. The bread was fresh and the meat was salty as it should be. The sweetness of the added ketchup rounded out the flavors nicely. At over $10 +tax, it's a little pricey for the portion size, but a great option to try at least once. Tables and seating is very limited save for a high table and countertops and some stools. Best way to get here is Spadina, College, or Dundas streetcars."}
{"text":"Torteria San Cosme does realllyyyy awesome tortas, or mexican sandwiches. We stopped in for lunch on a Friday, and it was packed! Always a good sign. We ordered the Pepito and added cheese ($10.50 + $1.95 for the cheese) and the del pueblo with adobo pork ($8.95). There was a lunch special for the del pueblo, so we got the esquites (corn niblets with some delicious cream and cheese) and a can of pop as well. 

We were really pleased with the food here! The sandwiches are served piping hot. The bread is very nice - it isn't too thick that it overpowers the sandwich. We were both huge fans of the adobo pork. It was simple, but delicious. The pepito was also good, but I wouldn't add the cheese next time. I know - who doesn't like cheese on their sandwich? Weird, I know, but the cheese was super thick, overpowering, and honestly quite flavourless. The steak was nice and tender. I also love that San Cosme serves a housemade pepper mix and hot sauce on the side. Make sure you don't miss those, especially if you like a kick! 

The price for the pepito (especially with the disappointing cheese) was a bit steep, but we will be back for the del pueblo and to try some other tortas!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the overall experience. Food only would be a 4/5.
We went on the first weekend it was open, crazy line-up and it took almost 30 minutes to get our food.. which wasn't horrible had it not been for the severe lack of ventilation inside. I do hope they'd gotten it fixed since then. We smelled like smoke for the entire day, and it was hard to breathe in there.
Service was friendly, the girl at the counter did a wonderful job, she did not rush and made friendly chats. I thought that was smart to even out the snaking line. 
We got the Pepito which was a steak torta, with guac and panella cheese. My favourite is the crusty bread, which eventually got soggy but still held up the ingredients pretty well. Perhaps, I found Panella cheese to be too heavy and chewy for my liking but it's personal preference. Overall, a solid sandwich. 
My favourite however is the Esquites (!! my mouth is watering just thinking about it).. which is a bowl of stewed corn. It was creamy, soupy, sweet and savoury at the same time. I personally am a huge fan of anything corn and creamy.
I would skip the house made chips, nothing really special and some have gone stale probably from sitting out too long.
I would go back to try their breakfast torta one day.. hopefully the line isn't so crazy and ventilation fixed!"}
{"text":"Torteria San Cosme isn't your average takeout spot for Mexican cuisine. For starters, they don't sell tacos, burritos, quesadillas, or any of the typical Mexican dishes sold at other fast food joints. They specialize in tortas, which are basically street style sandwiches that are served on flat bread.

My first visit here was an interesting experience. I arrived early (before 11:30am) and was surprised that there was no lineup, as I've seen it when they're extremely busy and packed.

I've never had a torta before and wasn't sure how the Pollo Con Mole would taste, but it was one of the less expensive options ($10.50). I figured chicken would be a safe bet. The sauce they used on my sandwich tasted different than any other I've tasted. It was an interesting combination of flavours and I enjoyed it. I'd have to try more of their sandwiches and sides before they make a full impression on me.

The upside to San Cosme is the atmosphere and newness of this location in a prime downtown neighbourhood. The music and liveliness go well with the food. 

The downside is that you have to come minutes after opening or before closing if you want to beat the crowds. They're definitely not going to be one of Chinatown's best-kept secrets. 

The menu is also really pricey. I elected not to get a side order because I didn't want to fork out $20 without knowing the quality of the food they serve. Aside from that though, I'd encourage anyone to give this place a try at least once."}
{"text":"Torteria San Cosme Mini-Hack: How to devour a torta (Mexican flatbread sandwich) in Kensington:

1) Timing: This ain't Uncle Tetsu; there's no need to be first in line. The place opens at 12:00 noon and there's usually about a 15-20-or-so-people rush. So come by at 1 pm and there should be no line. But don't delay either, they do sell out quick.

2) Food: order the Cubana ($12), a sandwich made with pan teleras, a type of savory bread traditionally made in Mexico and is a variation of the baguette. It's furnished with smoked ham, slow roasted pork, gouda, avocado, tomatoes, chipotle sauce and spicy dijon mustard. For those who don't like spicy, hold the dijon. For a mini-snack while you wait, order their homemade potato chips that are garnished with lemon juice and hot sauce (not even that hot, more sweet).

3) Grab A Seat: While the staff prepare your sandwich, grab some complimentary water, napkins, and cutlery and snag a seat facing the street -this is the perfect people-watching lookout... If you're feeling adventurous, get some pickled jalapeños from the large bowl to spice up your sandwich. The venue is colourful, spacious, modern with street-food style furnishings.

4) Price: With a price point of $10-12/sandwhich, it may or may not be a competitor for their neighbours Seven Lives ($10 for 2 tacos) and Rasta Pasta ($5-6/small jerk chicken with rice). However, their sandwiches are reminiscent of the very high quality sandwiches from Three Little Pigs but with a chockfull of Mexican-inspired flavours. 

Torteria San Cosme is a Mexico City-style street food hub at 181 Baldwin St, at the corner of Baldwin and Kensington Avenue. If you're looking for a new place to eat in 2016 while in Kensington Market, eat here. It's a colourful, modern lunch spot - and with lots of seating. A must visit while you're in the Market!"}
{"text":"In Kensington Market, they are one of the culinary highlights, though it is a brick and mortar location rather than a street cart like many other food options around, meaning you will be able to find some seating. Once ordering, it was super hot inside and verrry slow, but we were in no rush. 

They are a torta spot, a mexican sandwich. We went with the adobada, which features steak, cheese, onion, and avocado. A classic combo that's hard to beat. My quick take: get it."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday aiming for when they first open in the morning.  And I'm glad we did, because it was almost full seating wise, with a short lineup at the cash.  You order at the cash and you sit anywhere you can find a spot.  I gave my hubby my order and found the last couple of stools available.  It felt like an eternity before he was able to pay.  There were maybe 2 people in front of him?  He came back and told me that he would give the order, then the cashier would repeat the order very slowly, and my hubby confirmed the order, then the cashier would then punch in the order, the cashier would then get drinks, then tell my hubby the total, hubby would then pay.  Everything just felt like it was moving in slow motion.  We ordered a horchata, a raspberry drink, a cubana, albondigas, and a pollo con mole.

The horchata was delicious.  Best horchata i've ever had.  It was thick and creamy with the perfect amount of spices in there.  The raspberry drink actually turned out to be watermelon drink.  I just took one sip, but it was good, tasted like fresh watermelon blended.

The cubana sandwich was our favourite.  It had the most amount of flavour.  We ordered this one because other reviews said it was a must order.  The cubana has smoked ham, adobo pork, bacon, gouda, avocado, mustard, and tomato.

The albondigas I wasn't a fan of, not because I didn't like the flavours, but because i'm not a fan of meatball/sausages to begin with.  The hubby for some reason loves those kinds of sandwiches.  The albondigas has beef pork meatballs, morita tomato salsa, chihuahua cheese, avocado and roasted jalapeños.  Because of the jalapeños, there was a bit of a kick.

I usually love chicken mole, but this one was really bland for me.  I don't know if it was because the cubana had so much flavour, so it make the mole sauce taste bland, or if it was just under seasoned.  The poll con mole had chicken, mole, crema, cotija cheese, and red onions."}
{"text":"What makes a good torta? The bread! And San Cosme gets it right. Unfortunately it falls short in some other respects. I ended up going with the al pastor which wasn't done off of a spit, despite the drawing of the special at the front counter. Feeling a little bit swindled after watching them pull a piece out of the fridge and throw it on the flat top, I tried to stay positive. Upon getting the sandwich, my fears came true. The pastor lacked the crispy outside and lack acid to bring out its flavor. And while the bread was high quality, I wish it was grilled a little longer and had more texture. Lastly, the horchata had a lot of sediment and wasn't enjoyable and the jamaica was quite watered down."}
{"text":"San Cosme is one of my favourite lunch spots in Kensington. The food and atmosphere are both great, and the tortas are a nice change up from Toronto's ubiquitous tacos.

I had the steak torta (pepito) on a previous visit. The texture is right and there's a good balance between meat and toppings. The bread is particularly good; i think the bun comes from Blackbird across the street. There's not a lot of deep beefy flavour but everything tastes really good. The Cubana with ham is good as well.

My one quibble with the tortas is that, while delicious, everything is very mild. I'm looking for a little bit more intensity of flavour. Hot sauce and pickled jalapenos, available as condiments, are highly recommended, especially the jalapenos.

An under the radar pick, which I tried on my last visit, are the flautas. Fried, rolled tortillas with chicken or cheese inside, served with red or green salsa and cheese on top. Really tasty, and the tortillas maintain crispness despite the sauce on top.

The place tends to be packed on weekends, but usually there's room during the week for lunch. Definitely a spot that deserves repeated visits."}
{"text":"The first time I had the birria (goat stew), which was on special. It was delicious in every way - tangy, spicy, slightly gelatinous with a  good amount of meat in it.

I decided the next time to try a torta - after all, the place is called *Torteria* San Cosme - and ordered the cochinita pibil. Each one of the components was good, but the proportions/assembly were all off (e.g. bread/meat ratio was off; not every ingredient ended up in every bite), resulting in a sandwich that was *almost* very good, but not quite. These problems could've been overcome by some really good, hot salsa, but their chipotle salsa is too tomato-y and not particularly hot.

Oh -- and I've had much better tortas for much less money."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. Had the Cuban sandwich and it was beyond great. Delicious bread, there was the right amount of filling without overstuffing the sandwich. 
My wife and I shared one sandwich and one tamarind drink and that was enough for the two of us for lunch. Don't let its size fool you, it's pretty filling. I do like all the little treats from Mexico that line the shelves as well. The tomato was fresh and the place was clean. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Super yummy lunch in Kensington. The pulled pork(topped w plantains!) and chicken mole were killer. Full of flavour each was unique. Must add the pickled jalapeño for an extra kick."}
{"text":"I've been hearing nothing but raves for the food here in the short time it's been open, so I just knew I'd be stopping by sooner or later.

I arrived around 1:00 on a Friday and the joint was packed. The lineup to order was pretty much to the back of the tiny restaurant and it was as slow moving a line as I can easily recall. (It didn't help that the cashier was indulging many folks' questions and requests for substitutions; look, when you've got this many people waiting to order, it's not inappropriate to adopt the stern tone of the Soup Nazi.)

After what felt like hours, our order was placed and we received the food a short time later. I went with the Cochinita sandwich (Yucatan pulled pork, habanero pickled onion, fried plaintain, refritos) and I'll admit that it was worth the wait.

The pulled pork was tender and flavorful, and the remainder of the condiments proved a perfect accompaniment (I probably could've used just a tad less refried beans, however). The sandwich was also put together really well; given the insane crush of people, I was expecting a hastily-assembled mess but this was a picture-perfect concoction.

I also tried the papitas con chile (house potato chips, lime, chile piquin, salasa picante). These were much, much less successful. The house potato chips were bland and uninspired, and the only sauce I could detect was the salsa picante, which seemed to consist primarily of vinegar. I ate a few and threw the rest away."}
{"text":"I was excited to try out the Poblano torta but was extremely disappointed when I took my first bite. The torta and the everything together was so bland. I was so confused if the chicken was missing salt or just any sort of flavour. 

Blergh - ate it anyway since I paid close to $12 for a lunch sandwich and the bread/torta itself was delicious."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a Monday evening just after 5; ordered the Pollo Con Mole to go.  Place was empty when I went in, and it took almost 25 minutes before I was out of there with sandwich in hand.
The whole time I was waiting, several employees were in the kitchen, but only one appeared to be getting the sandwiches out.  I couldn't help thinking of the sloth in 'Zootopia'.

When I finally tasted the sandwich, it was disappointing.  The sandwich was dry, the bread tasted mealy and stale. I believe it must have been a day old at least.  The was not enough sauce and the mole was very bland.  Chicken itself was flavourless.  

For what is basically $12 dollar sandwich, after taxes, I expect more thought, care and effort and much better ingredients.  I have to say it doesn't even compare well with a generic fast food chain burger. 

Very disappointing result on a street with so many great alternatives.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love plantains, so when I heard there was a plantain burger here, I had to try it!

The cochinita is made of pulled pork, habanera, pickled onions, and plantains. There were only 3 pieces of sliced plantains in it, but I guess you can't stack that many in a burger any ways! The pulled pork was great. 

This place has a very fun and colorful vibe, it's a great place to grab lunch."}
{"text":"As a Mexican-american, I will go ahead and vouch for this place. Very legit. Yeah it is a little pricy but the food is great.

I got the torta poblana. The mole was not spicy at all, the horchata was good and the music was cool too !!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars.

I love sandwiches (and bread really) so this was a win in my book.

WAIT: Came on a Monday afternoon around 1pm and there was no wait.  We ordered right away, waited about 5 minutes and then got our food.

ATMOSPHERE: The inside looks like a typical Mexican taqueria with elaborate tile and an open kitchen where you can see them cooking.  There are high tables that is basically one long bench type with stools and then another high table that faces the window.  It's pretty small inside so I could see it getting crowded.

FOOD: Got the torta or sandwich.

DEL PUEBLO - adobo pork, mayo, mustard, tomato, avocado, onion. pretty simple but very good.  Next time I might try a different meat because the pork was a TAD dry in some instances.  I'd also add cheese next time for more flavor and moisture.  The bread was so crusty and delicious, slightly buttered and toasted.  The avocado + mayo helped to add some creaminess to the sandwich.  It's a pretty big size and can easily be shared between 2 people or if you can eat a lot, just by yourself.  I love tortas and this was one of the top I've had.

Overall, definitely worth trying if you like tortas."}
{"text":"Was here Sunday early afternoon, this place is packed. Limited seating. However really brightly decorated! We got stools along the window which was pretty nice. I really enjoyed my Cubana, but my friend's sandwich was even better (I think it started with a P). We also got horchata (milk/cinnamon) and tamarind (tropical fruit) drinks, recommended. Will come back to try other things."}
