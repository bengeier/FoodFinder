{"text":"This food court food is heavenly delicious! I am here three times in three days ---that's how good this seafood place this Yunmo"}
{"text":"I got the fish & chips, which for just over $12 was: two large but mediocre pieces of fish, a heap of admittedly pretty good fries, some unnecessary and below average salad (would've liked coleslaw but they didn't seem to have it when I was there?), and no drink. Not really worth it in my opinion, I felt kinda gross after eating there (and I didn't finish all the food)."}
{"text":"I'm on the edge about this restaurant. It is located in the food court in Eaton Center. I. Have eaten at the Aqua Lunch at Place Vertu in Saint-Laurent which is excellent. Better fish, better fries but about 20% more expensive. 

When the gentleman behind the counter took my order he asked what kind of salad I wanted as a side dish. Since I have never been offered salad at the Place Vertu franchise, I asked if they were owned by the same entity. I was informed that one had nothing to do with the other.

I ordered the fish and chips which includes a salad (I chose spinach and cabbage) and also a small soft drink. The cost without tip was $12.08 which is a pretty good value for the amount of food they serve you.

The fish itself were several small pieces of cod, slightly greasy, most of the batter being crispy but some soggy as well. The crispy parts were really good but the taste of the fish was lost in the batter. The fries were sub par. Nothing special. Not greasy but soggy. The spinach salad was great!

If the weather is good for a short walk without freezing or melting then there is a Brit and Fish on McGill street a short walk away which is probably the best fish and chips in the city. However, if you're craving fish and chips and don't want to take a short hike to get some then Aqua Lunch will suffice.

The establishment was very clean and the employees were exceptionally friendly."}
{"text":"A mall food court stand that serves whole Red snapper? What?

But I guess this mall is no ordinary mall and this kiosk is no ordinary food court stand either. Among the thirty odd stands at Eaton, this is the only one that made me stop and consider. The woman at the counter gave me a sample of their breaded fillet and that sealed the deal. The fish was moist and tender, and the breading was very light and delicately seasoned. I almost couldn't believe I was eating fried fish.

They serve all their plates with a fountain drink and sides a la carte. I got roasted root vegetables and curried potatoes with coleslaw and beets. That woman seriously piled them on the plate, which itself was enormous. Then the line cook in the back laid four huge strips of fish on top. The total price came to be ~$12, and it could have fed a small family. The sides were great too. The curried potatoes were spicy and not mealy. The coleslaw was crispy and prepared with vinaigrette instead of mayonnaise.

It's not like it was the best seafood ever, but it definitely rivaled the fish and chips served at the many respectable Irish pubs I've been to. What a wonderful, delicious surprise!"}
