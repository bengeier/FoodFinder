{"text":"Sorry guys but your buffet breakfast is not up to par. First of all 40 bucks for a family of 4 with 2 kids under 10 is a little pricy. Everything tastes reheated (which it is). Pancakes were hard as rocks. Bacon was tasteless and paper thin. Soggy toast. Not the best way to kick off your morning. That said, atmosphere and staff are nice.  This is simply a review of their buffet breakfast please take into consideration this is a pizza joint.  Keep working at it guys. Your pizza is still awesome!"}
