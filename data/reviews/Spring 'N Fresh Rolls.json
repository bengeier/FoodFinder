{"text":"This is by far the worst vietnamese food i have ever had. I ordered a green curry chicken, chicken congee, pork and beef vermicelli and an order of spring rolls. The curry had the consistency and flavor of green food colored water and the congee was basically water with rice, cilantro and a few chili flakes. The vermicelli wasn't half bad but the meat didn't taste the freshest....not a big deal in comparison to the rest of the food. The spring rolls were the standard frozen type but the nuk mam ( dipping sauce) it came with was tasty. Overall, i would recommend avoiding this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their beef brisket pho. However I wasn't fond of their spring rolls and their chicken pad Thai."}
{"text":"I could never understand why people would rave about pho and hunt around the city for its hidden pho-gems.  Then I tried the pho here. The broth is so flavourful and the owner has a secret recipe for chili-sauce -- he refuses to reveal the recipe or sell the sauce -- which makes all the food at this restaurant even more delicious. The Thai food isn't the best I've had in the city, but it's top three and you can't beat the price. Plus, the cutest family runs this place and keeps it impeccably clean. I'm always happy to give them my money."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! They are new to the area and have been soooo yummy in the last 4 times we've been there. Friendly and professional when I've asked about their dishes. Affordable, family-friendly,clean and free parking is a bonus. I am not a food connoisseur by any means, but this place is awesome! We also share our love of this food with Pho Saigon across the street. They are both always friendly and yummy.    I wanted to share my experience as I think it's important to share good experiences with local businesses. Hope this helps!!"}
{"text":"The service here is great. I really wanted to like this place. It's run by a nice family. After you order they bring out your utensils in a jug of hot water for sanitizing.   I ordered one of their Thai dessert drinks and that was really yummy. I ordered a bowl of pho and the broth was lacking in flavour. The beans sprouts it came with were fresh. It was a good portion size. Price was on the higher end compared to other Vietnamese restaurants.   Even though this restaurant had a lot of good aspects, I had to deduct stars because the broth for pho is one of the most important things for a Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Disrespecful, Dirty, Slow, Racist, Carelesss, Dangerous to sum up my experiance why i will never go here  I came here the first time after they changed the name from Kripsy Rolls. this was in 2006-2010 and went there decent amount time and every time we came in there they would always ask if we are in the right place, and said that indian/Hakka restaurant is next door. I didn't think much of it than but after awhile I understood what was going on. I felt it was racism, and they say we're in the wrong place every time we went in there. Imagine walking into a restaurant with your family and having the people ask you if your in the right place. I came here because I heard they had the best pho in town, and it was good.   So they changed the name, to Spring N Fresh Rolls and I thought it would be different. The venue looked dated, I peered in the kitchen and it looked like it needed a washing and cluttered I could see a huge rusty pot, on the stove top hoping that my food wasn't cooked in there.   . I ordered the Chicken roll, calamari, and beef and chicken noodle soup. I asked them not to put any tomatoes because I had sever allergies to tomatoes. They said okay   They bring the food, and it was decent, the soup was good, the calamari and rolls were dried. My lips were cut and I thought it was from the calamri. When we finished service was slow, and we were the only one in the restaurant near closing. When I got home my body broke out in hives and my tongue was severely bleeding. There was tomatoes in the food. and my body went in anaphylactic shock. It was either from the dip or chicken roll. My body is still hurting while I'm writing this review.   This was a terrible experience, and the lack of care I could only imagine if my allergy was even more severe what would've happened to me. It baffles me how a restaurant can make such a careless mistake. And the mistake was made because of the lack of care they have place in our food, and their customers. Would never go there."}
{"text":"Came here twice now and I gotta say they deserve more customers, they serve both viet and thai food, and the same server both times gave us amazing service.  We ordered the pho, and the grilled chicken dish and spring rolls. The portion sizes are HUGE compared to regular pho sizes, at least the biggest size you can get in Scarborough. The grilled chicken dish came with a fried egg, salad, rice and soup on the side too.  They have an opening special which is 20% off your order if it exceeds 25$, so after my bills came to 21$ which was nice.   I remember before spring n fresh there was another pho place that was awful, I'm afraid some people may get the 2 confused.  So my point is give it a try!"}
{"text":"Appears to be under new management as I remember it being called another name.   Lay out is clean, and service really friendly.   Liked how they provide your utensils in a pitcher with hot water, sort of as a reminder that you are receiving clean utensils.   Food was super tasty. Arrived hot, fresh and well laid out.  Portions were more than enough. Usually I would have a lot of rice on my plate, but happy to see that the meat empowered the plate. My only con would be that they didn't provide the fish sauce with my meal but I'm sure I could hold off on the extra 1000mg of sodium it contains.   Prices are very reasonable and consistent with what Vietnamese restaurants are charging nowadays.    I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Hot soup and tasty fresh rolls - great for  cold winter day."}
{"text":"We arrived in this restaurant hoping to enjoy some good food and of course expected a friendly environment. None of the servers smiled. We requested no peppers on our meal and we were told it's not possible to do that. This makes me think that they had prepared it already and would reheat it and serve it. I asked for extra sauce and they refused that too. Both our dishes were extremely salty and our rice was burnt. Both orders of rice had brown on them!! If you are looking for a good meal and good service go next door to Hakka Legend. They make their food fresh and accommodate all requests. It's also not high in sodium and a smile from a server will definitely make your experience better. I will not return to Spring 'N Fresh."}
{"text":"Pro. Friendly staff. Clean establishment.   Cons. Pho portions are less than average and pricey."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but poor quality food. Spring rolls taste like they are from frozen section. Pho broth is flavorless and masked by overly salty."}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service. The staff there are very friendly and attentive. Portions are big and reasonably priced. Only feed back is the batter on the coconut shrimp is a little hard. Other than that excellent food!"}
{"text":"Giving 5 stars for what it is  Affordable, massive portions of food, and decent/quick service.   Get your Viet fix for pho and bun here. Two sizes of pho, regular and large. Both are massive and can be shared.   The pork chop with fried egg and rice was delicious.   Pho had tons of noodles and reasonable amount of beef  Spring rolls were awesome. Large and crispy  At the time they had a promotion where if you spent $12 per person, you get a free drink (only available until August 2018 I think). I got Thai coffee which was very good, and wife got lime juice which was refreshing, she found it sweet.   Oh and very reasonable prices. Regular pho is below the double digit mark.   Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"5 stars cuz the chicken vermicelli was a huge portion and everything was flavourful it was busy at lunch time and I am sure that they are regularly packed with people. I ordered a thai iced tea to go but because I asked for less sugar... I can really taste the difference and it tastes like water. For this location, maybe it's best that no customization is requested. Looking forward to my next meal here, whenever that might be. A must try!"}
{"text":"My sister and I had lunch here and had a wonderful experience.   The service was friendly and the food arrived at a reasonable time. I had the chicken vermicelli which was amazing. The portion was big, the vegetables were fresh and the chicken was excellently seasoned. My sister had the chicken pad Thai and she really enjoyed it as well.   We are definitely thinking of coming back soon."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant where you order food and it will fill you up and satisfy you with the serving! I'm a pescetarian and i enjoy having various meals to choose from. Second time on this place and still loving the food! Great service and super yummy!! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"First time ever getting utensils brought out in a pitcher full of boiling water. I have a few kids and they brought out scissors as well.  The restaurant itself looks very clean and some parts have been renovated and some areas only received a new coat of paint.   We ordered the house special pho, chicken and shrimp fried rice, and Vietnamese spring rolls. None of the 3 items stood out versus all of the other Vietnamese restaurants out there.  That's not to say that they were bad, but just the same as others.   I would rate the food average, 2.5-3 stars and the a bonus 0.5-1 stars for the cleanliness."}
{"text":"I went here to enjoy Vietnamese food 5 days a week. I found that food in here in the best Vietnamese cuisine in Toronto. Especially Spring rolls and Fresh rolls, Pho and Bun are delicious too. This is my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Soup is good (rare beef noodle pho and tom yum) ate them serve time, rice paper spring roll is amazing as ways. Main meal (chicken and rice) cooked good, rice is cooked perfect, chicken is bland (needs more spices or sauce) little flavour. They always serve jasmine tea and food comes out quick.  Good little place with parking beside it for a quick and cheap meal."}
{"text":"I have been here many times to eat Pho. The portion is huge and the taste is mediocre. This time I got Chicken chilli dry and rice. Although it said dry, it wasn't dry at all plus the chicken was fried and almost tasted like kungpao chicken.   $8.95 for lunch special, comes with a free drink."}
{"text":"Thai, Chinese both? Some places need to stick to one and improve. Short answer.   Neg  The cold springs where as big as my fist. Noodles dish was a corn starch soup. Similar to the sea food dish. The fried chicken was no different than a buffet style fair. The table ware all brought to us in jugs filled with hot water, something seems wrong here. All the cleaning supplies nap sacks belongings left out on a table behind us for all to see.  Pos  The fried rice was fine. Deep fried spring was good. The mango vegetable dish tasty. Nice mirrors! x4"}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????ok????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Holy MSG!!! Now before you throw your hands up in disbelief I am going throw you a disclaimer; I don't have anything against MSG. Actually, I think it's a very useful flavour enhancer in moderation of course. I usually don't get bothered by it too much as I am Asian myself and we're quite used to it. However, this is really something else. Even a miracle additive like MSG does have it's limits and when you do get pass that threshold, your food starts tasting a little surreal. And this was my experience.  The soup tastes super concentrated, beyond flavour comprehension. The vermicelli can be dismissed and stay away from the very tempting (deliciously sounding) pumpkin curry soup; that stuff made me gagged a little - seriously.  I don't know what to say really but I do have one big question; how does a place like this even exist???"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. Came here with my family when they first opened.. Thought the food was okay...  the pho portion and price was fine but the soup tastes a bit light and different. slightly bland./ The fried foods were not cooked well. coconut shrimp overfried and a bit burnt and hard, I also ordered the pork chops with broken rice which was soso. Let's say I've had better. The service was nice and we got an opening discount. But overall, think they need to improve the way they cook fried foods and appetizers. The pro is their staff are very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Have to say im pretty disappointed that i have to find a new pho place to go to.  I think they may have changed owners and chefs because this place has gone downhill pretty quickly.  The pho broth isnt as beefy anymore.  The meat tastes like it was freezer burned and just thrown into the bowl.  The service was sub-par and i got sick after eating there so hopefully they will do something about it.  Definitely the loss of a great gem in that neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place seems to change names often. We tried the pad Thai, vermicelli, deep fried tofu and a rice dish that included pork, chicken and beef. The food ranged from average to good. We will need to visit again to try the pho however the rice dish did come with a small bowl of soup which was the pho broth - very salty so makes me weary of the actual bowl of pho.  Service was average at best. You order yourself on paper and the food eventually comes and then you ask for the bill. Atmosphere was pleasant and clean."}
{"text":"The first time that I came here was a couple years ago and it was pretty empty. Fast-forward to now, the restaurant was filled with customers, and it looked like some were regulars. I decided to give this place another try after finding out they've changed and expanded their menu. We ordered the house special pho, spicy beef pho, Thai green curry, and chicken spring rolls. I was disappointed when I tasted the broth for both phos as it lacked flavour. However, the portions were very generous. The Thai green curry had a watery consistency, which wasn't what I expected. My favourite dish from here was the chicken spring rolls which were fried fresh. Overall, I probably won't return here as I've had better pho and curry but it seems the locals around here enjoy it."}
{"text":"After catching a movie at Eglinton town Center we decided to try this place after reading the reviews here on Yelp. It didn't disappoint!  The Menu is extensive, offering Vietnamese, Thai and Chinese cuisine and the restaurant is very clean. Service is quick and courteous.   After placing our order the served us free green tea, and our cutlery/chopsticks were delivered in a pitcher half filled with steaming hot water. This was the first thing that impressed me.    The food was fantastic. We started with the authentic fried Vietnamese spring rolls, and the fresh shrimp rolls. Both were fantastic in freshness, size and flavour. We also ordered the beef, pork, chicken and fried egg on rice, which came with a clear chicken stock soup. All meats were seasoned well. The soup was just a tad too salty for me though. We also ordered Beef Pho. It was fantastic with a good amount of beef, noodles and the bean sprouts.   We noticed several families in the restaurant who ordered the hot pot. It looked really good with very fresh ingredients.   I'd like to try this one day.   Our overall impression was good. The prices  are higher than a lot of places, but the food quality, cleanliness and good service made up for it.   We will definitely return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I eat here often, due to the delicious food, quick and friendly service and great options for vegetarians.   There's something to suit everyone's tastebuds and spice level on the menu - and did I mention how incredibly nice the family and servers are????  I give this place 5 stars x2!!!"}
{"text":"A lot of confusion at this newly opened Vietnamese and Thai restaurant Spring 'n Fresh Rolls. As I was standing near the door waiting to be acknowledged.  The feel is authentic enough as a lot of Vietnamese speaking patrons and the side veggie that goes with whatever at the next tables were the freshest I seen in GTA.  Goi Cuon Bo Ga ($5.50) Grilled Chicken Roll as a snack since I am going to have dinner in 90 minute or so was perfect.  Grand Opening Special till June 30 for dine in but you need to order $25 pre tax... I guess I need to with some one..  Cash or Interac only!"}
{"text":"Great service - friendly, receptive Very clean - they even brought the utensils submerged in a pitcher of hot water to kill germs! Food - typical, good but not amazing  Worth a try! Will be revisiting :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by to dine in at this Vietnamese restaurant and was pleasantly surprised with the quality and quantity of their food. It used to be called Crispy Roll a while ago and we hadn't been in since - probably different owners, not sure. We had the fresh beef rolls and the grilled beef with noodle dishes - both were as expected - fresh, well prepared and served by attentive wait staff.  Will visit again if in the area!"}
