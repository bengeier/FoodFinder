{"text":"I had lunch here this afternoon for the first time. My companion and I thought that they had a buffet. Nope. That was disappointing - we like being able to try lots of dishes. Hopefully, they add a buffet at some point. 
Although that was disappointing, the food definitely was not. It was some of the best Indian food I've ever had. We had the veggie appetizer platter - the samosas in particular were great! We also had the aloo vindaloo and the paneer karahi, both at a spice level of 8/10. The spice level was perfect - both of our mouths were burning just right. The spices in and the flavor of the paneer karahi were incredible. The green peppers in it were cooked perfectly - still a little crisp. The naan was also delicious. It was crispier than others that I've had before, which I really enjoyed. I wish that I'd had room to try dessert. Kheer is one of my favorites and they have a mango one that sounds really good.
Overall, my companion and I were very impressed. The heat of the dishes was perfect. The food was delicious. Great first visit - more to come!"}
{"text":"This was overall the best Indian place in pittsburgh and I would put it in step above udipi. Unfortunately they appear to be closed indefinately.  I really hope they can get they're doors open again soon. I went there recently and it was closed. We debated going to another restraunt in the area however there are simply none in the same league regardless of type of food. Good luck getting the doors back open guys!"}
{"text":"The good here is fantastic, however, if you're getting take-out make sure you got the right order and everything you need.  At least three times now they forgot to give me rice.  Also, their hours don't always match up with what's on their website and they don't always answer their phone.   So don't order online and if you really want to order just keep calling back.  The food is worth their odd behavior."}
{"text":"Food was very good - tried a variety, including a thali.  The \"easy on the spice\" folks were happy with their bland food, and the \"Bring it on\" spice person was also happy.  So.. the food would get 4-5 stars.

The service is beyond mediocre.  The servers ignored us when we sat down, barely engaged when they took our order.  We were ignored most of the time - received water only when we asked for it, no chutneys with breads, certainly no check to make sure everything was ok, etc.  We could not even get a server to pay attention when we were trying to pay our bill and leave.  It's really unfortunate ... because if the service was on a par with the food, we would be going back!"}
{"text":"I placed an online order of  Malai chicken and goat biriyani.   

They promptly called me after 30 minutes to inform me that the order is ready.  So I went and picked up the food which was packed and ready.  Service was okay.  

Malai Chicken was very delicious and had the right level of spice and tenderness.  Just perfect

Biriyani was very average.   I does not taste like DUM biriyani.  For me it tasted like pepper fried rice with a hint of pudina and rose essence.   

I'm planning to try other dishes before judging this place."}
{"text":"Have been back several times for both in restaurant meals and several more takeout meals. All have been excellent. Best Indian I have been to in the Pittsburgh region.

My understanding is there has been a fire here and they are closed.
We are wishing the best outcome for the Kohinoor owners and employees.
We also hope you do open again in Monroeville."}
{"text":"One of the other reviewers said the service was beyond mediocre. That is being generous. The service is friendly when it occurs which was close to never. The place was not particularly clean appearing and the ambiance was non-existent. 

The food was just plain OK. Not really good but not bad either. 

I went once and don't intend to return. Very uninspiring overall.."}
{"text":"I CALLED THEM TODAY AND THEY ARE CLOSED, INDEFINITELY. The woman told me they need a new tax number if they want to reopen. (They had a fire a few months ago, were closed for a while, reopened, but have now closed again, this time indefinitely. http://www.pgplate.com/forks-blog/845-kohinoor-closed-due-to-fire).

I hope they reopen soon."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this Place, Food taste great, presentation is okay but flavor is really on point. I love how I can taste the pop of fresh herbs like cilantro and cumin. 

I';ve been here twice and both times I left full and happy. We ordered the malai chicken, aloo chat, and chili chicken which were all awesome. Strangely enough the chili chicken tasted like Chinese food but it was still good. 

Location is kind of bad. It's connected to that cheap motel in monroeville called the sunrise inn. not sure if they own the motel along with the restaurant but regardless I have had no bad experience with the food here.

Our waitress Jennifer was very accommodating making sure we had everything we needed and checking up on us frequently. I really appreciate the service here and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Okay, I have quite a number of co-workers from the Indian sub-continent.  They are excellent cooks and represent various parts of India.  So, I'm a little spoiled when I go to local restaurants and the food isn't up to par.

Kohinoor is that exceptional restaurant!  OMG! The bread basket alone will induce fits of breadgasm and make one wish that they were in the Tandoori oven that the breads were baked in.  My inner carb child was definitely satisfied with the breadbasket that we were served,

The chicken tandoori was was unlike any that I have tasted in the tri-state area and is the best that I have tasted, EVER!  Most tandoori chicken relies upon the spices to carry it along the pathway to tandoori heaven.  The Kohinoor's tandoori chicken had various distinct flavor elements that would make a mere mortal drool!  Salty, savory, smoky!  What's not to like?  The crispy edges could induce one to search for the chicken in the daylight with a flashlight in order to find that dish!

Now to the downside....  PLAN  on spending half of your time on planet Earth getting your food..  I was a part of a party of three and it took us over an hour to receive one of dishes that we ordered.  We ordered 2 appetizers and three main dishes and we actually received 2 of the main dishes before the appetizers and waited an eternity for our food.  BE PREPARED TO WAIT FOR YOUR FOOD!

That being said, the food is superb and delicious!"}
