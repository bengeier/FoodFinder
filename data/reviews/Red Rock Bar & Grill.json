{"text":"I'm giving the Red Rock five stars and believe me I don't do that often! My wife and I have stopped in here three different times for a evening or late supper and each time it has been excellent. After a horrible experience at another restaurant we decided to give the Red Rock a try. We only discovered it while getting a haircut  nearby.   Service: 5 star (our waitress was excellent, friendly and attentive) Ambiance: 4 stars (casual setting, not noisy or too crowded) Cleanliness:  4 stars (appeared to be clean) Food: 5 star (fish & chips, steak sand., wings, salad's, all excellent) Price: 5 star (excellent value for excellent food, supper & drinks for two for under $40.)"}
{"text":"Red Rock is like your everyday Albertan neighbourhood pub; it has a bunch of VLTs, it's small and trying to look neat, and it attracts locals on Saturday afternoon to read newspapers and sip on cheap draft. But Red Rock also serves pretty decent food.  It has a Greek-themed menu, which struck all of us as odd at the begining. But the food was good and at a reasonable price. The waitress told me later they serve \"Mr. Greeks\" greek food, which put it all into perspective. The lasgana I had was alright, but my girlfriend loved the souvlaki chicken wrap.  Not a bad place, all in all, and the prices are really quite moderate for good food."}
{"text":"Went for appetizers at Red Rock on Tuesday, July 29th. We were pleasantly surprised to find out it was wing night, so we ordered 4 different flavours of wings for our table. The decor had changed a little since my last visit and was really well set out with nice tables and chairs. Also, the old style \"VLT wall\" had been reconfigured to make for a more inviting lay out. The quality of the wings was wonderful. They were a decent size and were also cooked perfectly to be crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle, as well as just the right level of seasoning. I have to knock off one star, as the server was a bit of a space cadet. She almost had to be hand-held through the ordering process, rather than be our guide. Hopefully she was newer and just needs to build up some skills and speed. We will still come back."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood pub that has had regulars coming here for decades. We did not even know that it was here - it is tucked into the back of the same strip mall as the medical centre. We had no idea what to expect walking in but were happy to see the outdoor banner advertising Mon-Fri Happy Hour 4pm-7pm! Whoohoo! Domestic beer on sale for $4 bottle or draft, $4 well drinks (vodka, gin, rye, etc) or white\red house wine. We went on a Fri evening at 5pm or so and the place was half full. The staff was friendly, the place was clean enough (even the washrooms), the menu was varied and the music was 80's metal\rock (too heavy I think but it is what it is). Apparently, this place underwent new management and a new chef so if you have been here before and did not like it, maybe it would be worth a second look. I was told that they were famous for their pizzas. People were ordering them and many were seen going out the door for takeout. I went for the vegetarian pizza and hubby went for his fave bar meal, a burger and fries opting for the Bourbon BBQ burger. The burger looked ok when it arrived but the bun was too thin on the bottom and fell apart bite 1. The patty itself was way overcooked with a black bottom. $13. My 8 inch pizza was a better value at the same price, really hearty, thick, full of fresh toppings with good quality cheese on top, tangy sauce on the side. I detected nothing frozen. It did take quite a while to come out so do not order pizza if in a hurry. Hubby is not picky but would never get a burger here again (fries were good though and served hot). His beer was cold and my house white wine was surprisingly tasty and refreshing. The VLTS nearby us looked fun and me being from Ont, was a different concept in a bar. I did watch a guy win $2200 right before my eyes! The place was a bit 'rough' and will not be a regular hang out for us. I am no prude but literally all you could hear every second word from tables all around us were Fbombs and vulgar type chat. There is a pool table and dart boards. Staff was open to hearing about the food and only stated they would take the comments good and bad to the chef. Not a place for kids whatsoever. I would grab a pizza for take out in the future but that is about it."}
{"text":"The Red Rock Bar and Grill wouldn't be my first choice of pubs.  It's a fine establishment with all the offerings of a regular pub, but there's just something about this place that makes it my last choice of Crowfoot pubs.    Perhaps it's because there isn't much space to walk around what with all the tables and chairs, VLT's and pool tables.  Or maybe it's because the lighting is too bright and the TV's are too loud.  It could also be because the couple of times I've been there the patrons have been rowdy and rude.  We're all there for the same reason, to have some drinks with friends, but it seems like the regulars think they run the place.  They move their chairs around so you can't squeeze by, they crowd the pool tables, and they give you funny looks when you try to make your way through the maze to the bathrooms.  The staff, on the other hand, is usually pretty nice.  They seem to manoeuvre their way easily through all the people and chairs to serve you.  My hat goes off to them for being calm and collected while working this place.  I've only ever eaten the wings from Red Rock, and those were not disappointing.  They allow you to mix up different flavours to suit your own taste.  We usually get teriyaki-hot wings, which are a nice blend of sweet and spicy.  Just delicious.  I suppose I haven't given Red Rock the credit it deserves, but my experiences there haven't been the best.  If all the other Crowfoot pubs are too full, then I'll try hitting the Red Rock, but otherwise, I try to steer clear of the mayhem."}
{"text":"We go here quite often for dinner.  Their beef dip is really good.  Onion rings are excellent.  Fish & chips are excellent as well.  Most of their food is very good.  It has become our regular haunt for dinner.  We keep coming back because of the food but sometimes the service is very good too."}
