{"text":"GRANDPA'S PIZZA IS the best pizza in the Maryvale area! I know there's another pizzeria right across from this place but hands down every time I would choose GRANDPA'S PIZZA. I highly recommend dining in as well. I've been to several pizzerias in the west valley but as a local this is the place to eat. They have specials for their pizza and wings. The wings are a must! I've been dining here for 10 years now and each time the pizza is absolutely superb."}
{"text":"Best wings so crispy pizza is good too , only downside is that it's a small place couple tables and can get crowded and hot also a long wait so we order in advance and eat in"}
{"text":"I give them a 5 because the food is delicious! !! You gave to try their wings so good. I have to say it was a really long  wait time on a  sunday football day  tho"}
{"text":"I wanted to try a pizza spot that's not apart of the food chain.. The customer service was good.. But, all 45 wings were bad. Husband throw up immediately after eating them at work.. First impressions mean everything.. I'll never go again."}
{"text":"So this is my first time here. When we got done ordering. I went to go get me something to drink, and When I go to drink it. It was like a warm hot. So I told the guy and said why is this soda machine is giving me warm hot drink? And his reply was \"that's what the ice for\" and my reply was well I don't put ice in my drink. And it should be already cold when I'm getting the drink. And he didn't say something."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are on point! Would recommend the wings! Best mom and pop pizza spot in town"}
{"text":"When I went it was dirty. The first time I went a few years ago it was dirty. Needs a major overhaul as far as looks go. Walking in looks literally like someone slapped a restaurant together with some pallets. Now the food...if you like sour tomato sauce in all the food, then this is your place. None of the employees seem to care and they are all wearing street cloths. Doesn't anyone care? If I'm coming to your restaurant to support you, give me a reason to come back. I've been here twice and never have I felt welcome. Poor food with poor atmosphere and employees that don't care makes it strike 3 for me."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! I waited 45 min for a pizza and 24 wings just to find out there was a \"mistake\" on my order but then was told no one made my order! It was my first time at this place and I live literally 5 min away. I could have been a potential regular here. My kids love pizza so it could have been great business for the owner. They only had one table dining in when I placed my order so to find out they \"forgot\" to make my food more than upset me! They even had 4 other people come in and leave with their food. When asked  if I would receive something to potentially come back they clearly said No and when I spoke to the owner over the phone he made little effort to make me a happy customer. Needless to say I will never attempt to go back. Don't waste your time or money at careless places like these!"}
{"text":"Ordered wings tonight, they were the worst I've ever ate!!! This is usually the go spot for wings but I dont know what happened tonight. We always order medium. The sauce tasted discussing. It didnt even sauce the wings."}
{"text":"Grandpas Pizza!

Been coming here for years although it's been quite a while since I last came in. Not much has changed.

Customer service is good and their prices are very fair. They have a few different beers on Tap and a few others available in Bottle. They also have some good deals that vary by the day.

As for the food the pizza and wings are always fresh so they do take a while to come out. If you order wings I recommend ordering them extra crispy if you don't like your wings too soggy as they put a good amount of sauce. 

Customer service is not bad and there is plenty of seating. You can also call in and order for pick up.


-Also even though they do have a sign that gives you a warning, their Hot Wings are HOT so if you don't like spicy food all that much I recommend going with the mild or medium."}
{"text":"We had buying pizza and wings from Grandpa's for the past 6 years. The past 3 years they have really gone down hill. The dough for the pizza has lost it taste and texture. The wings were the best in town but they did something to the sauce. Half of the time we got burnt wings. Dry with no taste. I am sorry but you want to keep your customers coming back for more then go back the way you used to make your orders. This saving and trying to make money on gross food will just put you out of business!! Go back to the original way of doing your food!!"}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza, nice and crispy. Let me not forget to tell you it's greasy. Wings are also crispy which I love.  TVs available so you can watch the games which my boys like.  Not to much to this place its older building.  Service is good. You order they bring it to your table and you  get you own drinks."}
{"text":"The wings here are always on point, not sure about the other food served here. Staff is always nice. Always a great deal being advertised."}
{"text":"They take for ever to do the food but the wings are great good place been going there for years"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a couple years and now I remember why. The pizza was super hard and wings were burnt and had zero taste. I remember coming as a teenager and everything was really tasty but now I guess it went downhill. To make matters worse the customer is horrible they all look unhappy and they charge you a service fee to use your card."}
{"text":"This is one of the best wing spots I've been to. The traditional medium wings (my go-to) are AMAZING. There's so much flavor and they're just spicy enough without being overwhelming. I always order them extra crispy and they always deliver. My wings are always spicy and crunchy, just how I like them. Must try!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh!!! I freaking love grandpas!!!!!  Lol the pizza is so good here. 

You order food, I always get the large pepperoni pizza and 25 wings (medium) comes out to like $33 bucks I think with a drink. You sit down, the wings are hot so be careful. You get the ranch because it's freaking amazing there. Then you get the pizza, a good amount of cheese, marinara sauce, and pepperoni. But what gets my attention is the crust/Dough they make. And they have cheap beer on my days off! It's my favorite pizza/wings/beer combo ever."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a long time over the years,the pizza and wing are always good .The service(staff)and the wait is horrible,called in a order Over the weekend was told it would be ready in 30min arrived and they said it would be another 10min .waited and waited and was told it would be another 10min ending waiting 1 hour overall for one pizza and a order of wings.The guy at the front desk had no sense of urgency .I'm kind of reconsidering  finding a new pizza spot."}
{"text":"The cashier was very friendly. The wings are awesome, they're not the small wimpy ones, these wings are big and have a lot of meat on them. They're not stingy with their wing sauce, or ranch. Having a paper towels on every table is very convenient. Place is a little too small, so it gets crowded easily."}
{"text":"Friend came in the door with a couple of slices, I opened the lid and said \"Wow! Where'd you get this great pizza!\" Said he got it at a place called \"Grandpa's Pizza\". This is your ordinary NYC style, thin greasy delicious pizza. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"The place has great food I love the staff in the afternoon, but the young staff at night are very rude and almost racist if you're not Hispanic.  I have been going since a kid but since this new young staff has been there it's been terrible. I would NOT RECOMMEND their business."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for a minute! We would drive out of our way to eat some good wangs! Beers are nice and very cold and goes down real good while eating pizza & wings.  The locations is shady but sometimes thats where the good food is!"}
{"text":"I've been coming for many many years and they have the best wings. The only bad thing about this place is their costumer service. They are not friendly. You are never greeted when you enter the door. I only come here for the wings."}
{"text":"First off, I have to say that the food was general good, but not worth the price that I paid for.  

I arrived at this place at around 8:15pm; note that this place closes at 9pm and I mean 9PM SHARP.  When I first walked in, there was absolutely no one there, but the workers themselves, which I thought was good thing, since me and my family would have the place to ourselves, but it also came to mind, that this might be a bad sign, but whatever I proceeded in nonetheless. l happend to Order one large pepperoni pizza in combination with 25 wings and 4 drinks, it all came out to about $35.  I then proceeded to the soda dispenser and come to find out all the sodas and juices had no syrup or too much carbonation, it seemed like pepsi was the only drink that was working.  As for all the other drinks, Dr. Pepper, Tropicana fruit punch, Orange Soda etc... they were all not tasting good. The pizza was served right out of the oven, it was very hot, just how I like it, the pizza crust was very tasty, but the cheese, pepperoni, and sauce were mediocre. The wings had a good amount of meat on them and were very good in my opinion, this was the better part of the meal.  But what got me is that once I was done eating, I proceed to the restroom to wash my hands, even though they do provide for every table a roll of paper towels instead of your conventional napkin dispenser.  Which I did like, since chicken wings can get messy at times.  Once I arrived at the restroom, it definitely needed a re-model and even though it was clean, the tile was beyond gone, as well as the head boards, the trash can which was suppose to be white was in fact brown and hand nick and knacks all over it. Not to include the tagging that completely filled the restroom, but I can't really blame the restaurant for that.  The best thing about it though that it did not smell at all.  Once I finished washing my hands, I was just watching the game back at the booth, Suns Vs Trail Blazers, note that it is about 855pm, and we were pretty much done I was just waiting on the girls to finish their food, and still not one other body came into the restaurant during the whole time I was their. Right as soon as it turned 9pm, one of the workers just flicked a switch and BOOM, the tv cable box was shut right off. and they literally kicked us out, I mean the guy was pretty nice about it, but never in my life have been kicked out of a restaurant like that, note that me and my family were the only customers they had within the last 45 minutes."}
{"text":"There pizza & wings are AMAZE!! I looooove eating here for lunch it's takes a bit for the pizza to cook but over all it's great!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Grandpa's pizza for easily over 10 years now. Even through different owners they've always kept the same amazing recipes for their pizza and wings. The only thing that's changed is that now they charge for extra ranch. Is ranch REALLY that expensive to make that you have to charge 1.00 more if I need it for my pizza AND my wings?! The place is just a small hold in the wall so I wouldn't recommend it for large parties but it's perfect for a chill spot to watch a game and have some beer without breaking the bank or dealing with too many people. The staff are not the friendliest and I feel like they hate their job but they've never outwardly rude or make bad food so I'll keep going back"}
{"text":"This was awful pizza. Ordered a large supreme and it had next to no meat veggies on it. They were out of mushrooms, so I expected more veggies on it. There were miniscule amounts of yellow pepper, red onion and olives. That was it for veggies. The crust on a frozen pizza was better than the crust on this one. It was very hot in the restaurant, I assume they had evaporative cooling as it was very humid in there. The eating area was dirty, both the floor and booths. Definitely won't go there again, a waste of $17 for a pizza."}
{"text":"Starving after the Phoenix Good Sam 500. Looked up good pizza places and Grandpa's Pizza popped up. Love trying local places so we stopped in. Let me just say YUMMMMMMMM! The pizza was cooked perfectly the wings were nice and crisp and the staff was super friendly. Will come back next time we come into town."}
{"text":"Their pizza and wings not to mention the pitchers of beer with ice cold frosty mugs are oooooo so good. First off the pizza is definatley a mom n pop pizza. I am not a fan of pizza hut, dominoes, little cesars, papa johns or any of the others. This pizza is very VERY good and the crust is wonderful. The wings are the best, Hot are to hot for my liking and yes I eat tapatio and serano chilis. But the hot is pretty hot. If you are going to eat 5-8 wings the hot is good but we usually order 50 and that is just to much so we go with the medium. They have a wonderful flavor to them. I have recommended this place to all of my family and friends and even strangers!!! There prices are good. I believe the combos are something like this one large one topping and 25 wings about $25 and then you can do two pizzas and upto 50 wings in a combo for about 40$$  :) Happy eating"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place out after reading the reviews here on Yelp but I was less than thrilled about both their pizza and wings. The pizza tasted as if it had come from my freezer. It had very little sauce and very little cheese. Completely flavorless in my opinion. The crust was plain and there was a lot of it. 

I tried both the medium and hot wings and was as equally displeased with both. The hot weren't hot at all and tasted too much of Tabasco sauce. The medium were, in my opinion, mild but had a slightly better taste than the hot ones. The only thing that was a plus for the wings was the fact that they were a good size and were indeed meaty. 

I won't be ordering pizza from here again. I've had much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"The wings here are delicious I would recommend getting mild but nothing hotter then mild or else it will taste like Tabasco sauce. Other then that this place is okay the pizza is okay they have other items on their meal menu but I never had it just their pizza and wings the service here is okay they don't seem to happy but they get the job done the bathroom doesn't look to clean sometimes it doesn't have soap or paper towels to dry your hands. And it looks like they could clean up seems like it's been a while since they last cleaned it but they have an A rating from inspection posted in the front so I guess it's not to bad I give a 4 stars for the awesome wings and okay service but if they were a bit friendlier and if it was a little cleaner and had soap and hand towels in the bathroom it would get a 5!"}
{"text":"I only go here for wings. Customer service and wait aren't so great, but if you want wings, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!!!! Pizza is always fresh and hot. Crust is delicious. Service is fast and friendly"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a teenager. Love the pizza and the wings are so good especially with the ranch they have omg"}
{"text":"The pizza was great and the wings were the best I've ever had. The guys working didn't have the best customer service, but the food is worth a bit of attitude."}
