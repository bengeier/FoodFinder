{"text":"Great local dive. Typical bar food but otherwise good and decent price"}
{"text":"Good service, easy parking, great food. Buddy does a nice job with a place that has lots of room and is easy to get too."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend to try out. There are a lot of chain restaurants in Monroe, and I like to try things that are off the beaten path so to speak. This restaurant/bar was pretty good. Fried food and sandwiches are the main items on the menu. I had the philly cheesesteak with onion rings which was good. I also tried the fried corn nuggets which were delicious!! I recommend getting those as an appetizer on their own. My friends had a crab cake wrap which they liked, a chicken sandwich smothered in cheese, bacon and mushrooms (anything smothered in cheese and bacon tastes good), and a chicken tender basket. The place is huge, so if you have a big group, this is a good place to go! Also, bottled beers are around $2.50 or $3.00 each."}
{"text":"Came for lunch b/c reviews said good wings.  Waited close to an hour for our food.  They were not that busy, but EVERYONE that ordered after us had their food before us.

Wings sucked, burger was decent, chicken wrap was good.

Service and kitchen were slow as hell... Will not return"}
{"text":"Food is really good, used to go more often when he was is in Wingate food was always fresh and good. Still good food with a variety to choose from."}
{"text":"Being new to Monroe i was thrilled to discover this place so close to my home.
Prime rib sandwich is GREAT.  Plan to make a weekly visit to Buddy's."}
{"text":"This place is very near my home and one of the few places in downtown that are open past 6.  As such, I end up there fairly regularly even though it's mostly fried bar food, which isn't my very favorite food choice!

The drinks are good, their fried pickles are really good and the banging shrimp is what really keeps me coming back.  I'm a pescaterian so there are less options for me, which I am not surprised by.  I DO wish their salads had a little more to them with good lettuces and toppings but considering where they are located, I shouldn't be surprised that the fried items are their strength

This place has a great and friendly environment and they do have music and other entertainme .  If you are in Monre and crave a sports bar, this is much better than BW on 74 and worth taking the detour!"}
{"text":"Great place - a live music venue with good food, drink and service!!  Extensive menu with something for everyone.  Don't miss the Thursday night musicians open jam to hear some of the best local talent around."}
{"text":"Discovered this gem yesterday and was so glad I did!  Recommended by locals my friends and I were eager to check it out. A bar, a pool hall, a  restaurant area are all part if the Buddy's Point experience. The menu offered a a wide variety of options. Much of the menu is prepared on site and popular items such as the prime rib sell out quickly. Given that the food is both delicious and very reasonably priced that's not a surprise. The service was excellent and our waitress answered our numerous questions patiently and knowkedgeably. I definitely plan to make Buddy's Point a regular eating destination."}
{"text":"Ventured out here Friday night looking for more local places in our new home town. I was disappointed that they didn't have the crab cakes, but the chicken philly sandwich was good. Fried corn and corn nuggets were good..  DH was disappointed that the BBQ plate wasn't \"piled high\" like the menu described.  We would go back. Our waitress was attentive and kept drinks coming and filled."}
{"text":"First time at this place. Bartenders were very friendly. Food was just OK. I had the blue burger and it was dry and only came with burger,cheese and bun. Had to ask for onions lettuse and tomatoe. Frys were hot and yummy. Food came pretty quick."}
{"text":"This is a decent sports bar in the heart of Monroe. The portions are huge and it's really hard to figure out which fresh side you want with your meal (onions rings, chips, fries, okra, etc.). This place is NOT fancy, but the food is solid and the drinks are affordable. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Extra parking across the street, including a big shade tree to park under if it's hot out."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant; great service, delicious food, reasonable prices, clean bathroom, cool signs and pool area, will be back if I ever return to this town!  Recommend the corn nuggets and cheeseburgers."}
{"text":"We came for the trivia and stayed for the \"beverages\".  Their prices were very reasonable, $2.50 - $3.00 for a bottle is not bad at all.  I had the Corn Fritters with my beverages.  The flavor was excellent, I just wish there were more of them.  I guess that says something! Someone else had the Chicken Mardi Gras which looked good (if a little basic), but what do you want? It's a bar!"}
{"text":"We found this on Yelp on a business trip.  This place is some of the best food I've had in a good while.  Bangin shrimp is awesome!  Waitresses extremely friendly!  We are a ton, drank more than a few... And was still cheaper than the mediocre steak place we are the night before.  I will be back every time I am in the area."}
{"text":"This place needs \"Bar Rescue\" and seems to attract the upper-lower and lower-middle class crowd. I had one drink, a Jack and Coke, and it was so watered down that I quietly finished it, paid and left. NEVER going back."}
{"text":"Hi this is jacks 8 year old son JAXON. Out of all the barbecue places this is my second best. My first best is bonfire I mean you agree with me right folks! Their hot dogs are so good, there bacon cheese fries are the bomb! If you have been there you know they have a few pool tables I don't remember how much. They also have a bowling game and fighting game and another game. It's awesome! They also have a dance floor so if they play music, you dance and wing it.Thats why you should try Buddy's Point. This is Jacks 8 year  old son Jaxon if you didn't know jack has a 12 year old son too!!!!"}
{"text":"Surprised my husband - he was expecting a dive. Food was really good - husband said best PoBoy he has had. Plenty of parking - good bar, and sandwiches were great!!"}
{"text":"What a great place!  The owner is unbelievable. Great fried pickles. Cheeseburger quesadilla was awesome."}
{"text":"Solid service, spectacular Flounder.  Never given 5 stars - 4 is quite special. Go get you some."}
{"text":"This is the place for wings! Have not found another restaurant that even comes close to
Buddy's wings. We always go during lunch time; service has always been great. Went for dinner once and I ordered the flounder filet; my goodness the fish was bigger than my plate and it tasted wonderful. My hubby, kids and I all ate some and we still had leftovers to take home.The owner Buddy is such a wonderful gentlemen, he was always walking around checking on everyone. He would talk as if you were an old friend. Have not been in awhile hope to get back soon."}
{"text":"Nice place! Service was awesome since it appeared the server was also the bartender. She was great though. Food was good too. Only down side is my fries were just a little over cooked. The dessert was very good too! It's a cheesecake wrapped in a pastry type tortilla and fried. It's called the original cheesecake Xangos."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from the midwest so we really struggle finding a fun joint to eat and drink at.  But at Buddy's we have a GREAT time and feel right at home!  Buddy is a super guy and he's always there to shake your hand and make sure you're enjoying yourself.  So glad to find a top-notch outfit in NC!"}
