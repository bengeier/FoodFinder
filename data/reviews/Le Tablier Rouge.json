{"text":"This was a bad dining experience because of the food.

The location on Fleury street is gorgeous: it's in a quiet and hip part of town, and they have a small patio. They also have a nice assortment of microbrewery beers in bottles, and a smaller variety on tap.

My friends and I ordered 2 poutines and 4 burgers.

The bacon & onion poutine was decent, but it was also drenched in sauce. Even after we ate all the fries, there was so much leftover sauce. Very \"soupy\". Also, very little bacon.

The second \"braised beef\" poutine was terrible: the beef was cooked, NOT braised. When we brought this up to the waiter, he apologized saying they had run out of beef for braising earlier in the day.

He should have told us the beef was not braised, instead of attempting to pass it off, and hoping we wouldn't notice. For this he did not charge us for this poutine.

The hamburger patty (7$) was small, dry, flavorless, had too much mustard, and it was served with one measly slice of tomato (see imagery).

Hoping to get on our good side, at the end, the waiter offered us a plate of cold cuts (homemade capicola, which was average) and a free desert for the group: homemade donuts with a flambé sauce. Saddly, the alcohol from the flambé had not fully burnt, and there was a strong taste of alcohol. 

Lastly, despite the restaurant not being crowded, we waited over 30 minutes for our meal. Mind you this was for an order of 4 burgers and 2 poutines.

The waiter tried to explain himself on the issue of the \"brazed beef\", the lack of tomato in my burger, and excess poutine sauce. He was kind enough to try to address our grievances, but he could not make for what was overall a poor dining experience, and disappointing, pricey food.

Stay away."}
{"text":"Burgers are made fresh.  Had the cheese stuffed one, added bacon and it was awesome.  Wifey had the 'Sophistique' and it was a huge success... again.
Great place, simple ambiance, noise level reasonable so you can actually have a conversation.  The owner even came to serve us and asked what we thought... look nowhere else."}
{"text":"Finally got to try le tablier rouge the other day while wandering by myself in that area. 
It is based in ahuntsic in the north of Montreal along Fleury street .

By the look , the restaurant looks like a dinner type filled with small tables and a small counter that serves take out meals , as well as a variety of meats , cheeses and salads.

Anywho, as for the order , I had a burger and a poutine . Burger was pretty average considering I had high expectations because of the many reviews discussed on urban spoon . Nonetheless , the meat still tastes fresh and it's obvious they have a beef of high quality. 

The poutine was exceptional , although it is not for everyone considering the meat chosen(forgot the name) , and that it sort of tastes like spicy meat sauce. It is indeed not for everyone cause the fries are served soft due to the sauce,but I do believe that it is very original and different of other places that serve poutine across the city. A big note , I did the mistake to take the poutine by myself which I didn't finish and thereby had to bring home as takeout for late dinner (easily fees two or three person) .

To conclude , I do believe that this place is worth a visit and I will gladly return to try the other items of their menu , such as their hot dogs or insane sandwich that made me salivate from the look of the menu .

Enjoy fellow Yelpers , it is worth the moving up north of the island."}
{"text":"Très difficile de classer cet endroit entre une boucherie, un restaurant ou un bar!

L'endroit est bien décoré et les tables massives faites d'immenses troncs d'arbres sont entourées de bûches qui nous servent de chaises.

On peut y arrêter pour prendre tout simplement une bière en écoutant le hockey ou encore y aller pour manger un souper complet.

Le menu est évidemment surtout constitué de viande donc burgers, charcuteries et saucisses sont à l'honneur. Sans être extrêmement originaux, les burgers sont faits avec une viande de première qualité et est hachée sur place, ce qui en fait tout un délice!

Finalement, il ne faut pas s'étonner de voir plusieurs passants s'arrêter au comptoir boucherie simplement pour récupérer une pièce de viande et repartir!

Un endroit à essayer absolument.

À retenir:
Si vous ne trouvez rien qui vous intéresse sur le menu, vous pouvez choisir une viande au comptoir boucherie et on la coupe et la cuit spécialement pour vous! Incroyable!"}
{"text":"Très bon service. Portions généreuses.  

J'ai aimé mon hamburger et ma poutine. Franchement, ca vaut la peine de faire un détour pour y aller"}
{"text":"To start we had a platter of homemade cold cuts served with their homemade pickled eggplant.  Key word here: HOMEMADE... Everything is done in house.  This is one of the best burgers I had in a long time.  No BS, no funny exotic ingredients, just a simple freshly made delicious burger... As it should be!  As a side, we had freshly made fries with the house exclusive fried pepperoni chips.  A must try for any foodie!  This place is also a butcher shop, so if you want to pick up a fresh cut of meat, a meat pie or anything with meat, you'll be glad to know they got you covered.  This is a great place to catch the game while enjoying a nice meal and a cold beer!  I'll be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"It was a warm sunny day and we decided to go eat a quick bite. We work near Fleury street and decided to go to one of the restaurants on Fleury. We settled on Le Tablier Rouge. It had burgers and sandwiches. I ordered a cheeseburger and we ordered a basket of fries for the table. Others ordered poutine and panini. The fries were so  greasy and disgusting, I think the oil was used, the fries had a certain smell to it. The burger didn't even taste like meat, and the beef patty had split in three, like if it was falling appart. Let's talk about the ambiance, its very small and rustic. The tables are made from tree trunks and the chairs are also tree trunks. It's kinda cool but after 10 minutes on those stools it becomes really rough on the behind. All in all I would not go back, the owner was really nice, but the food was left to be desired."}
{"text":"Je suis assez mitigé sur cette place à la fois boucherie, bar, restaurant, épicerie. Le coin pour manger assis est sympa. Grosse table très épaisse en tranche de tronc d'arbre, quant aux assises elles sont du même acabit.  Les produits servis sont frais. Nous avons mangé à deux un burger, une salade, un panini à la saucisse thaï, des frites et deux cafés. Les frites étaient grasse et trop cuites, le panini bon mais trop gras, le burger était pas mauvais mais la viande un peu trop cuite. La salade était bonne mais sans plus. Les expressos étaient bons. 
Pour synthétiser, les produits sont de bonnes qualités,mais la cuisine manque de professionnalisme.

Pour finir, c'est un bon endroit pour passer des soirées de match (5$ le burger avec frites. 5$ la pinte), ou l'on vient pour passer un bon moment entre potes, mais pas spécialement pour très bien manger. 
Le service est de bonne qualité et très courtois."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I'll be harsh with Le Tablier Rouge but I cannot give it an honest 1 star. Come in and read my tale...

The visit started with me reserving my seats for 8:15 PM off the Yelp app. I receive confirmation of my reservation and even a text message to confirm my reservation an hour or two before I get there. Sounds good right? WRONG!!! When we got there, guess what? Our reservation wasn't respected. In fact, the place has about 25 seats... for about 4 tables! Why do you accept reservations? On top of that, they happen to be playing the hockey game (my surprise). They quickly set us up with a small wobbly table, some foldout chairs place us between tables and we make-do. Welp, that's a fun start!

Next up, we'll talk about the service because that dictated how and when we got our food. She initially ignores us mostly because one of my friends made an off-comment about why even allow reservations. It's clear from the start the single waitress is extremely busy and is well over her head. I ask her if we can get menus and she's rude and is pretty much \"yeah whatever.\" We laugh at the situation, eventually she comes back and provides us menu.

I went with the Sloppy Joe Burger and fried pepperoni. Our table also went with the Italian sausage sandwich, poutine and a cheeseburger and fries. The food managed to arrive about 30 minutes later and it was disappointing. 

Let's break it down :

- The Sloppy Joe burger is smaller than expected. It was good but nothing great, I was famished so I scarfed that down.

- The fried pepperoni looks NOTHING like the previous pictures. NOTHING. First of all, most were burnt from being fried too long making many of them tasteless. It should be slightly fried to achieve what you want to do. All I tasted was burnt. Some were black.

- The poutine wasn't edible as the amount of salt in it was staggering. OVERKILL!

- My friend's fries were decent but once again, very salty as well. Her burger however was even smaller than my Sloppy Joe and held ingredients she didn't initially want. After some discussion with the waitress, the food was brought back to the kitchen, she waited over 20+ minutes to get it back.... to get the same issue once again. INCREDIBLE! At this point the waitress lost her cool and my friend just took the burger, we were finished eating at this point.

- However, we wanted to continue our dining experience, we craved the Queue de Castor (fried dough with Nutella) as the previous pictures looked amazing. End result was a $7 delicious Queue de Castor but clearly half as big as the previous pictures have indicated. Beware!

All in all, I wouldn't go back. Portions were small, weren't all that great. Service was lamentable and the whole reservation is an inside joke. If it wasn't for the queue de castor, I'd have put this down as a 1 star."}
{"text":"I don't like giving bad reviews, but wow this place didn't impress me very much.  I came here with my wife, she had a burger and fries and I had the Planches de charcuterie.  Now keep in mind the platter is 10.00, but all they put on the board was a few slices of super thin deli meats.  There were 3 meats and one of them was utterly unidentifiable (photo uploaded), not only that but it was obviously frozen as the meat came to the table ice cold and still had frost.  My wife ordered the cheese burger and the cheese that was inside the burger wasn't even melted.

As for the the look and feel of the place, it looks like it was initially designed well, but no one is taking care of it.  The walls in the bathroom were filthy, so this makes me worry what the kitchen may look like.  Don't think I will be going back here unfortunately as it's in a convenient location."}
{"text":"Bons prix, bon décor et pas trop loin du métro Sauvé. Le resto est aussi une boucherie et les burgers sont délicieux. La serveuse, bien que gentille, semblait un peu perdue. J'y retournerais sans hésiter!"}
{"text":"Les burgers sont fait maison et ne sont pas immangeable. J'ai été déçu par la qualité du pain qui était dur et difficile à manger. La viande était cependant de bonne qualité. Les frites sont faites comme je les aiment. La deco est magnifique et bien pensée. Le service fut un peu hésitant mais dans l'ensemble c'était correct. Je reviendrais peut être histoire d'en avoir vraiment le cur net car je suis resté sur ma fin (faim)."}
