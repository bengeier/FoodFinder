{"text":"Grilled Stickies and the Buffalo Chicken wrap are my two favorites.  I can't wait to get them again soon!!"}
{"text":"went here for my little one since he loves the \"Smiley\" commercials.  Wasn't really impressed.  My hubby liked his food.  Don't think I'd go back.  I'd rather go to Friendlys."}
{"text":"After a few incidents at this restaurant I will not be back. Today we went in and waited.....over 15 minutes after we were seated and no one came by to get out drink order. Two waitresses were just sitting in the back chatting. So we left. Before that it took them over an hour to cook a piece of chicken for one of the orders in our group. By the time we had gotten everyone else's food and had eaten, the chicken was still not done. Should have seen the signs then. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this place and they could do everyone else a favor and close down. Customer service sucks there."}
{"text":"The service was horrible, we waited about an hour on our food and once we got it it was ice cold except one dish that was so nuked it was rock hard. Most of the servers were just sitting around on their phones and one server had track marks all over her arms. The bathrooms were gross and i never seen employees wash their hands. Avoid this place like the plague!"}
{"text":"Good Friday was and always is good at this location their fish and Mac is always consistent and good. Service was very good the gentleman was very good at his job and the food was also very good. Keep up the good work there at the 51 location."}
{"text":"I only go here Tuesday mornings for the breakfast.  That's pretty good for the price.  Otherwise the food is bad.  Most of the waitresses are nice and friendly, but not that attentive.  You usually don't get refills on your drinks unless its coffee.  Its always been clean and tidy."}
{"text":"This Eat'n Park has great food and is my local Eat'n Park. The Original Smiley Stuff (t-shirts, mugs) area does not have any t-shirts. Pizza at this Eat'n Park is good. This is the best Eat'n Park I've been at!"}
{"text":"It's E&P. It's the same everywhere unless someone is having a bad day or the order is wrong.   The food is pretty consistent and even the pickiest of eaters can find something on their menu. Burgers seem to be the highlight of the menu right now. The late night menu gives patrons who dine after 8 a big bang for their buck charging a measly 2 bucks for a slice of pie among other happy hour type prices for other yummy bites.  While not 5-star, this chain is a hometown favorite and who could turn down a smiley face cookie?"}
{"text":"We had dinner here an got the saild bar all the plates where dirty I had to look through them to find a clean one told them about it an they told me they to care of it so I go back up same thing everything is dirty needless to say will never be back"}
{"text":"Went to eat and puke had dinner the meat loaf the others in the party had a hamburger the place is dirty the food was nasty greasy could not even eat the meat loaf the burger was so greasy the food was just plain nasty my fork and knife was so dirty  the food was bad I can't see how anyone could eat hear my god the place is nasty  how could anyone like this place ??? I wouldn't take my dog hear to eat if you go hear plan on at least 2-3 hours of your day in the rest room. Good luck ! This food chain will not be around much longer  I see they closed the one in streetsboro  hopefully they close the rest of them"}
{"text":"My friend from Pitt said that this chain is a huge part of Pittsburgh, as in it's where everyone goes when they have no where else to eat. She said it was like a Denny's and we were all just starving in the morning, so we said what the heck and headed there.  It really is just like a Denny's. Or maybe like a cross between that and Marie Calender's. They had a lot of pies and such, but my native friend warned me that they tasted bad. The server sat us right next to a hot buffet, and right then, I knew that I didn't even have look at the menu. It was only $7.99 for the hot brunch buffet, at least until 11:00 and we had gotten there at 10:30. The breakfast items consisted of yogurt, sausage, bacon, eggs, potato cakes, hash browns, apple pie poppers, fried cream cheese corn bites, oatmeal, and some other things that I can't remember. I was disappointed because I thought the corn things were chicken nuggets and the apple pie things were jalapeno poppers, but thinking back, considering it was breakfast, that should have been obvious...  The food tasted alright. Nothing particularly special or disgusting. What WAS great was that it switched to lunch about 15 minutes early so I got to eat the lunch buffet for the SAME PRICE. It added ham, mash potatoes, penne pasta, chili, stuffing and gravy, macaroni and cheese, and fried chicken. I was sad though that they took away the cream cheese bites and the potato cakes, because those tasted great. Considering the price and the relative quality of the food, I'd say that this place was a bargain. My friend's omelette looked okay, but I didn't try any of it because I was too busy with my own food.  My friend also insisted that we had to eat a Smiley cookie, which is what they are apparently known for. It tasted pretty meh..."}
{"text":"We come here often.  We always get the same. . . My husband and I order bacon cheeseburger and salad bar.  My 11 year old daughter orders burger and fries with gravy on the side.  Which never comes out right.  We go to the salad bar with only iceburg lettuce available, no Spinach or spring mix.  Female restocking without rotating anything .  Ask for some spinach and got an attitude.  No chili on salad bar.  Decided to try potato soup.  This particular location is not consistent on soups.  This potato soup was horrible.  Pushed it aside hated it.  Daughter says can I try it?  I say go ahead.  It was just going to be garbage.  Waitress stops by and tells my daughter she shouldn't be eating that.  You are not allowed to share.  This made my daughter feel like crap and wouldn't eat and made her cry.  Proceeded to tell us we we're wrong.  Well, I told her if the salad bar was stocked properly this problem wouldn't have been there.  SHE MADE MY DAUGHTER  CRY OVER SHITTY SOUP I DIDNT WANT TO EAT!!!!   And then proceeded to tell us how wrong we we're.  Again, my daughter felt guilty and cried.  Manager had no emotion and said what do you want???  Long story short left with a sad child and a free salad bar.  How do u question an eleven year old??????  Will NEVER return to an eat n park ever!!!!! HORRIBLE PLACE.  HORRIBLE, INSENSITIVE SERVER."}
{"text":"My sister ordered my food to go with her order. We got a $10 appetizer platter, and it had 3 onion rings, 3 half pretzels, 3 Mac n cheese bites and some chips. I've never been so disappointed in my life. Barely any portions and bad food. Never going back here"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this particular Eat n Park since I was a child. I even remember when you had to specify \"smoking or non-smoking\" when asking for a table! This one is newly remodeled and on a lazy Sunday evening, it was the place my boyfriend and I decided to stop at for dinner. The food is consistent. Nothing on their menu will blow your mind away, but it's always good. I usually the buffalo chicken wrap or the chicken fingers with fries and I ALWAYS get the salad bar. The salad bar is always fresh and has a decent variety of salad toppings, veggie sides, fruits and dinner rolls. You also can't go wrong with their potato or broccoli soup. The ranch at EnP is always delicious. Their strawberry lemonade is wonderful. The Oreo pie is divine. And last but certainly not least, the Smiley cookies are always a treat. It's impossible to leave EnP and not at least have 1 cookie, or splurge like we always do and grab an entire box to take home with you. Eat n' Park is a Pittsburgh favorite and will always have a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"Had a really good breakfast today here.   Server was cute and perky.  Food was well prepared."}
{"text":"Ok, since we could not find another place to eat.  My blueberry/wholegrain pancakes were somewhat grey and not very tasty.  The boys did not eat all their food, which makes me think that the flavor was just ok.  Denny's would be an upgrade."}
{"text":"Got seated by the manager waited 17 minutes until i got up to get a waitress. No kidding saw 4 wait staff go by and look at us and said nothing at least 3 times. It was not that busy maybe 20 people 5 wait staff and a manager. Food was good but service was not good. We felt like a zoo animals being looked at."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly enough every time I've come here, which isn't many times. The food tastes like it would come from a truck stop with no exit for 100 miles. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich from the menu here once and they gave me a Tyson chicken nugget covered in hot sauce. But hey, their iconic cookies are always great?"}
{"text":"Two things you should never do at Eat N Park. One is Eat. The other is Park. Unless by parking you mean, parking with a member of the opposite (or same) sex, and making out or even going all the way. Because that sounds like a great use of a decent parking lot.  Regrettably, I had to visit this place with some fans after a show here at Borders of Cuyahoga Falls when it was still in existence. I wish they would have taken me somewhere half decent.  The parking lot is about the only thing decent about Eat N Park. It's absolutely awful. Overpriced, and completely bland and generic, and usually puts you in the bathroom very frequently for several hours following the meal.  I should mention, I only rate national and global chains on a scale of 1-2. I rate family businesses on a scale of 3-5. Here is why:  Would you rather support the local family, or the multi national corporations and the rich men on yachts in the Carribbean? Why are the parking lots of the awesome local places usually half empty (or completely empty)? Why are the chains always so busy? Why can they afford to open so late and get all the TV advertising and all the prime intersection locations? Why are they always in shopping malls? Why go and support Denny's, Chilli's, TGIF, Olive Garden, or the horrendous Applebees? These places have systematically and coldly taken over the national food scene by using the cheapest ingredients, pre-packaged frozen systematic meals that are identical across the nation, overly high prices, rude underpaid servers on way less than minimum wage, and a ridiculously expensive mass brand advertising campaign that gets inside the heads of all the kids and the 20somethings and keeps them under the illusion that if it's not a brand name, it's not worth visiting. They spend all the money they should be investing in food and service, in advertising and cornering the market - the local places can't compete - and someday all we will be left with is the same chains serving the same food all over the world. That is our future. It's the way we're heading and you know it. Every time you eat at a bland national chain, you buy into that, you support that. Boycott chains. Support your local eateries. It's an embarrassment that generic brand national chains are even listed on a proper foodie website like Yelp, let alone getting 4 and 5 stars from so called foodies. Wake up, America, before we're all just batteries in the matrix."}
{"text":"Came here for the breakfast buffet. Every thing thing from the buffet was cold, the eggs, the potatoes, the French toast - COLD. The bacon was nothing short of raw. The food was not good AT ALL. I will never come back here again, friendly staff, clean place, but the breakfast buffet - just awful."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning with my 5 and 7 year old kids.  Service was extremely prompt and courteous.  Waitress brought our drinks and told me another woman would be waiting on us, she would let her know we were ready.  She was out IMMEDIATELY, took our order, and apologized for us having to wait.  The food was fresh (my daughter got pineapple and it was cut to order) and the food was out quickly.  Our drinks were never left empty and the waitress was excellent.  Very clean restaurant, excellent service, great food!  Best Eat N Park location I've been to in a while!"}
{"text":"Only redeeming factor here was our server Faith. She is awesome! She gets a full star.  That being said, the food was just food. No flavor at all. Had their \"award winning\" Superburger (copy of Big Boy burger) and it was bland. Lettuce was old, sauce while on the bun had no flavor. The burger itself was just ok. Fries were hot, but unseasoned, and unless that is done right out of the fryer, one has to rely on condiments.  Salad bar had a nice selection. This is the reason for star number two. I would say I would just get the salad bar option as a meal next time, but there won't be one.   This place is a one and done for me."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this eatn park my whole life and it is always a good experience.  They remodeled the restaurant in the past couple of years to make it more modern looking.  The addition of the drive through was also a nice touch.  Whether you are here for breakfast or a late night meal, the service is usually fast and the prices reasonable.  Eatn park's food is very good for the price you will pay.  Their Buffalo sauce is some of the best I have ever had, so the Buffalo chicken tenders or wrap is a favorite of mine.  They also have what I would say is the bet ranch in Pittsburgh.  The super burger is also another classic can't go wrong choice."}
{"text":"Eat N' Park is the type of restaurant where you can already sort of tell what's going to be good about it. They are big on the smiley cookies as well as the pies of the month. Those pies are delicious, and the strawberry one in particular stands out as one I have to have every so often.  Why the two stars then? Well, when I have to actually go in and Park N' Eat (bad pun intended), my experience is much different. I've been here several times over the years, and service has ranged from fine to nonexistent. I've never had mean servers, but I have had aloof ones. I remember a couple years ago I had to wait 30 minutes between being seated and having my order/drinks taken with family, then another 30 until the food arrived. That could be forgiven if the place was packed, but it was just about empty. It may not be fair to add that to my opinion since it was not recent, but it's those memories of a place that stick with you.  Onto the food, over the years the staple for the family and myself is the mile-high meatloaf. It helps that it's hard to screw up, but those have always been nice and hearty, not to mention filling. In recent months I have also had the chicken wraps. They are nothing special, though the buffalo one is much spicier than expected. I've had a couple of their seafood dishes as well, which I haven't cared for.  I would not go out of my way to eat here, especially with two buffets in walking distance of the place. If someone was in the area and knew exactly what they wanted from there, however, then I'd go, since if you know what to get and are able to be a bit patient, it can be a fine experience. If not, it's going to drag."}
{"text":"Always a great place with nice people, especially when Nicole is working.  She's cool!"}
{"text":"Yet another really good Eat n park. They have the Pumpkin Chai Lattes this month which are mouthwatering! We could have gone to our Banksville or Dormont locations, but Darren hadn't been here in a long time. I like their Nantucket Cod in particular. The server here was really sweet as well."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place in the world. I grew up at this location. Eat n Park is a well known Pittsburgh institution for diner type food. I have many fond memories of this place and many friends who have worked here.   Some of my favorite meals are the Super burger and fries, the house salad (with a side order of fries), and their chicken sandwich with sugar snap peas (and french fries).  They are also home to the smiley cookie. No trip to Eat n Park is complete without a smiley cookie."}
{"text":"Left after it took way too long to get drinks then was told only dinner option for me was spaghetti. Everything else had meat and their veggie burgers are awful."}
{"text":"It's an Eat'n Park so you know what you are going to get.      Service wasn't so hot this time and not sure why as they weren't busy.  I had a turkey club which had yellow American cheese so it looked weird.   Otherwise, it was a typical turkey club.  My husband had the chicken noodle soup, which is consistently good.    He had the sandwich special which was a tuna melt.  It was not a typical tuna melt.  It was a tuna sandwich with melted cheese.   Not what he was expecting at all.  He got the silver dollar pancakes and thought they had a good flavor."}
{"text":"We dropped in for Thursday breakfast at Eat 'n Park in Parma, the official home of the Smiley Cookies, which are hard sugar cookies frosted with smileys and peace symbols offered in several colors. Fresh baked pies made on the premises are also sold here. This location has a good sized carpeted clean dining room. At this location, the breakfast buffet is offered on Tuesdays and on the weekends. I've also dined at another location in Pittsburgh, where they offer buffets 24/7 on the weekends.   We were seated promptly in a comfortable booth and started out with hot coffees. My friend thought the coffee had a weird taste and told our server who brought out fresh brewed cup moments later. We ordered 2 Original Breakfast Smiles ($3.99 each on weekdays), which includes 2 eggs (we got egg beaters for a small $0.30 upcharge), 3 pieces of crispy bacon or sausage, and choice of hash browns, home fries, or potato pancakes, and toast. My friend was able to substitute potatoes for a fresh fruit cup at no extra charge. Breakfast was served to us in under 10 minutes. The food was pretty decent tasting, standard breakfast fare. The egg beaters were soft and fluffy, the sausage patties were firm and juicy, the bacon was crispy, and the deep fried potato pancakes were crispy and greasy. The fresh fruit cup had grapes, melon, and cantaloupe.  The service was good and we were offered and given refills on the hot coffee by our waiter and another waitress as they walked by our table. Before leaving, I did purchase a dozen frosted Smiley Cookies ($6.99) for the long road trip down I-71."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I love it. Buffet or eggs benedict - it's delicious. They decorate for the season and holidays. They also have merchandise for sale. Today, our waitress - Beth, was great. Thank you, Eat-n-Park!"}
{"text":"For a diner style restaurant, when all you're in the mood for is anything besides healthy food, eat n park is an excellent choice. Service is always fast and attentive, even when they're mobbed with groups.  During my trip to Pittsburgh, I ate at eat n park twice: dinner and brunch.  For dinner I had the buffalo chicken wrap which was great, and I'm convinced they have the best ranch dressing on the planet.  For Sunday brunch we were able to have a little breakfast and a little lunch at their brunch buffet. So much bang for your buck here.  I definitely recommend the Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"This is a cheap and decent place to take a family.  It isn't anything special, but you can get a good meal for a cheap price."}
{"text":"One of the best eat n parks I have been to. Always a pleasant experiance and is a great place for a late night meal or desert for people who work late."}
{"text":"My waitress was super nice. Food was quick and affordable. I dig the little chips that came with my appetizer."}
{"text":"Eat n Park is a Pittsburgh tradition. It is tried and true. It's a family tradition for a lot of families. It is a family friendly restaurant. The wait staff is usually nice. The restaurant is always clean. The food is where they waffle. One word-inconsistency. Sometimes, like yesterday, the chili is watery. Sometimes, like yesterday, my scrambled eggs were more fried than scrambled. My safe bets here are The Original Breakfast Smile and the Rosemary Chicken. Yesterday my safe bet of the Breakfast Smile wasn't consistent. I was bummed. The server was kind enough to check to see if there were biscuits left because I ordered breakfast at lunch time. I was able to get biscuits which was nice but my scrambled eggs were fried and not scrambled. Their seemed to be no seasoning on the eggs either. Scrambled eggs are not a tough dish to make. My hash browns were cooked well but again seemed to lack salt or pepper. My bacon was barely room temperature. It was the customer service we received from our waitress that got my review up to three stars. If it was solely based on food it was you have been a one star review."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this eat N Park recently while the one on Library road is under construction.  It is large inside and remodeled since I last frequented this location (1990's). Gone is the smoking section and they have a bar-height counter, near the waiting area, that has a large screen TV.  It also has a drive thru.  They get a lot of business during breakfast, but it moves fast so I haven't experienced long waits.  The food is on par with what you expect, which is good.  It's 11am but feels like noon since daylight savings just ended.  I'm still getting breakfast but my companion is getting lunch.  Might be an odd combination of smells!"}
{"text":"I had ordered a sugarfree apple pie 2 days prior to the pick up date. A young man (who I assumed was a manager) took my order. When I went to pick up the pie, no one knew anything about my order nor had they even had one ready and baked. I wish I had gotten the young man's name that took the order. I'm glad I didn't prepay for it too. This restaurant sure lost my business."}
{"text":"Before I came to Pittsburgh, I'd never heard of Eat n Park -- they certainly don't exist in Michigan, Wisconsin, or Illinois.  They're basically a regional diner chain: think Bob Evans or Denny's with local flair and you more or less have it.  They have two claims to fame: breakfast/brunch buffets and smiley cookies.  The buffets are standard fare, and the smiley cookies are big hits with the kids.  This particular Eat n Park is very popular: so popular that there was one time where we got seated but never served.  We ended up waiting for about 30 minutes, and then having to leave because it was time for church.  The waitstaff and the manager were mortified that it happened, and true to their word it never happened to us again -- and we've been there several times since.  We find this to have been an honest mistake, and it's always refreshing to see an establishment own up to its errors and strive for improvement.  Oh, word to the wise: feeding smiley cookies to your young children is probably a mistake.  Once the sugar high starts, your children will become miniature weapons of mass destruction, demolishing everything in their paths.  Your living room (and your pets) will probably never forgive you.  There.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"This month, EnP is offering up their Buffalo Chicken salad with a twist: they're adding waffle-cut sweet potatoes to them, and damn does it make a candied, caramelized difference, particularly when grilled onions become a factor. Drizzle on some ranch dressing, and I'm home, man. Give me some Dutch Apple Pie a la mode, and I'm floating towards Valhalla.   This EnP is one I hadn't been to in ages and ages, but Kay wanted her some EnP, so here we found ourselves on a Friday evening, and yes, the fact that I had yet to review this one played a role in our going. Our server Rachel was as bubbly as a bottle of seltzer water.   And that's all there is to say, really."}
{"text":"Short n sweet, I needed a place to hang out while waiting for the car dealership service center to open. Very nice ladies to chat with at the counter whom also happened to be the waitresses. Quick to refill the coffee cup, which is good coffee, not great and had a short stack of whole grain pancakes. Nutty flavor from the whole grains and oatmeal in the batter, maple syrup topped it off perfectly.   It's Eat N Park, no frills and a good hot breakfast under 6 bucks. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"We went in to try this place out for first time. Waited at the front podium while the hostess smoked her second cigarette out back. Finally seated. Sat there for quite a while. Finally ordered a coffee and of course they had to make it. Waited while the waitress helped other tables and ignored us. Then she blew us off completely and hurried to the back to smoke. WE WALKED OUT. WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE THAN DENNYS ON BROOK PARK. AVOID THIS RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"I've been going to ENP for over 50 years. Great selection of food for all ages. Waitresses are very friendly and accommodating. Prices have increased more then we'd like but we still try to go a couple times a month."}
{"text":"Good pan cakes good potatoes good bacon cleaner than Denny's slow service bad hash browns good coffee"}
{"text":"Eh, it was fine.  I ordered the $3.99 breakfast with one egg, sausage and home fries.  It tasted just like you'd expect.    The whole place seems open and clean and our waitress was attentive.    It's worth spending the $1.99 to get a piece of their pie of the month."}
{"text":"Nice place and the service is always friendly. Not fantastic as to where I crave it but not terrible as to where I'll never go back. A family eatery with a reasonable price. They always give cookies to the kids and this one was recently updated."}
