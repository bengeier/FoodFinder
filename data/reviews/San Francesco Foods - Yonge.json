{"text":"Got the crispy eggplant sandwich and it was no bueno. I thought it would be comparable to California Sandwiches but there is no comparison. California Sandwiches makes the best Italian sandwiches hands down. Not only are they larger and much more substantial, they are also cheaper and taste wise, they are phenomenal. If you're into good vegetarian Italian sandwiches, don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"Avoid the franchises, the quality of their execution is not on par with Clinton original location.  I've had both the veal sandwiches and panzerottis at different occasions and came up disappointed. The veal sandwiches was both pricey and dry, definitely undersauced. The panzerotti was too greasy, undersauced, and looked deformed. The grease was literally dripping in my car - seriously, could u not have provided a box instead of a paper bag?  WTFF!?  Are the staff properly trained?  Is a panzerotti supposed to look like that?  The franchises have imho ruined the brand's reputation."}
{"text":"If only all they were selling was ketchup....  First time at this chain/store.  I got the pulled pork sandwich, based on the staff recommendation.    The sandwich had a nice bun, a decent amount of meat, and probably the worst flavor for a pulled pork that I've ever had.  The fries were nice and hot, crispy coated, and salted beyond tolerance.  The ketchup though, was very nice.  The staff were friendly.  The pizza in the display box looked like it dated back to the store opening.  When all was said and done, I couldn't finish my food because it was disgusting, and now I'm still hungry.  Sad."}
{"text":"I've been aware of the chain for a bit but never made the time to visit. Now one has moved in down the street, and it was incredible.   It's obviously new so the store looks really nice and was still very clean.  Seating was a couple tables and a row of chairs at a bar looking out the window.   As for the food, I got the meatball sandwich, traditional poutine and a can of pop, while my girlfriend got the pulled pork sandwich, fries, and a can of pop too. All together it was around $28 after tax which I thought was pretty good for the amount of food we got. The food took a little bit longer then I expected, but the fries seemed fresh and hot so it may just have been the time to cook the fries to order, and it was definitely worth the small wait. The food was really tasty, the buns were very soft and fresh, the meatballs in my sandwich were moist and delicious, with a bit of a nice crispy exterior. The tomato sauce was flavorful and the cheese was melted and added a nice, almost creaminess to the sandwich. My girlfriend really enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich, she thought the meat was nice, and the free extra jalepenos added a lot of spice. Now the fries were a highlight of the meal, as I said above they came out fresh and hot, but most importantly, very crispy. Which brings me to the poutine which honestly, kind of surprised me in a positive way, it was amazing. Just to be clear I got the traditional poutine and not their specialty Italian Poutine. The gravy they use tasted perfect, the cheese melted well, and the fries held up the entire meal, basically my three requirements of a good poutine. The sandwiches were huge and to be honest it was too much food (although we finished it all!). It's not a complaint that it's a lot of food but I think next time I'll try their smaller size sandwiches.   Overall it was a great first experience here, really delicious food for a good price, and I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"To the best of my recollection, this was the worst food I have ever had in my life. Worst quality, worst taste, bad service."}
