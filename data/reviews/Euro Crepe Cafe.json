{"text":"I went here for crepes 1-2 years ago.  From what I remember it was okay.

This place is now closed March 2011."}
{"text":"When it comes to crepes, I like to keep the filling simple.  My favorite is lemon n' sugar.  

The Lemony Sweet Crepe, I ordered, had just the right amount of tartness and sugary sweet.  Listen, as soon as this puppy arrives, forget fork and knife, use your hands and eat it while it's warm.

If fruits filling is your thing, the modified Euro Dream with Peach, Strawberries, Banana with Chocolate Syrup was delicious as well.

Who knew?  They sell cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory.  For those who are crazy about this cheesecake company, no need to drive across the border for it.

Prefer lose leaf tea?  They have quite a few good selection here, 18 assorted flavors.  I tried the Jasmine tea.  It was lovely."}
{"text":"I'm certain that the Danforth has better to offer, while venturing out for brunch this morning crepes and eggs couldn't have sounded better however Euro Crepe Cafe fell a bit below my expectations. While the server was quite pleasant the offerings were less than appetizing at times, the crepes were fairly dry and the fillings were very bland. A little salt pepper and spice go a long way. Their winning combination was a handful of parsley and dry scrambled eggs. The bill itself was on the small side, but the portions followed accordingly, one egg per crepe and a fruit side consisting of a miniature watermelon slice. A pretty safe bet is anything with the fruit, or the crepe special; nutella and banana, both are pretty standard crepe fare. I'd bet you can find something better for breakfast."}
{"text":"Stopped here for the Sweet & Sticky crepe featured @ Taste of the Danforth and decided to opt inside the restaurant for a bigger portion. The Crepe was excellent and I would recommend trying that one, the only thing was they added too much hazelnut spread and it overtook some of the fruit flavors. 

There is little room inside to enjoy with a group so I would suggest going with one other or two at the very most. Service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"In search of a Cafe that would offer me and my 3 Musketeers some space to chat and enjoy Dessert near 9 pm, we arrived at this Euro Crepe Cafe which I have passed by multiple occasions where they really let you know they offer Cheesecake Factory products.  

For some weird reason, I find the interior looks like a hybrid between Symposium and Caffe Demetre.  A personal preference of course but I would have liked it either a bit brighter environment or classy.  There are small knick knacks Winter themed here and there, so there is enough visual displays to keep your mind interested during your stay.

Friendly waitress and the bigger fellow looked after us.  Bigger fellow was a bit more intimidating actually but he was just built that way.  Waitress took our orders and even modifications without any notepads and was very helpful in explanations of ingredients and options.  Example: Letting us know which Fruits are fresh and which are canned.

Cappuccino  -  Definitely a Cappuccino in the Euro sense which came fully foamed and had that bold Italian Roast flavour.

Strawberry Waffle, Lemony Sweet Crepe and Cheese Cake were all good and the first two are freshly made.  I liked the Strawberry Waffle more so than the Lemony Sweet Crepe.  As for Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake, it was pretty enjoyable and not as dense as some NY Cheesecake."}
{"text":"I think someone could open a restaurant and serve pastries bought at Costco or Walmart and do the same job. In addition it has zero charm, and absolutely nothing to recommend it.

The coffee was low-grade and the pastries (such as they are), insipid. Neither of the 2 ladies I was with was saying Gee Wiz.......

A place to forget...but its clean....."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and expected to be blown away by the promise of delicious panini. I ordered the Italian panini with a side salad and a latte. My panini was mediocre but my friend ordered the Greek panini which was much tastier.  I liked the sesame seed bread used but the salad was a dud. The whole thing came to $14 and truth be told I was a little disappointed with the meal as a whole.

I would maybe come back to try their desert crepes which looked delectable."}
{"text":"Our sever was nice, we sat on the patio, we had a crepe.  Nothing really stood out about this place.  The patio is a little small for the number of tables they have on it.  The crepe was a little eggy for my taste."}
{"text":"I just love the smell of freshly made crepes and waffles... Nothing beat a nice warm and toasty crepes on a cold winter night. 

It was not the aroma of crepes that brought us to Euro Crepe Cafe... walking aimlessly on Danforth looking for a dessert place that will makes everyone happy is not easy.... Nothing made the cut until we walked by Euro Crepe Cafe... 

At first I thought this place is closed... since there is no opening hours posted at the door and no sign saying that it is still opened.... the place is empty aside from a few people at the back of the restaurant chatting away... ended up they are the server and the cook... When I asked what time they open till... no one is sure... then they agreed that they open till 11 pm... (for sure is family owned! :P) 

All the staffs here are in their regular bum clothing... their dress code is hoodies and loose pants... how homey can we get?? The services though is quite decent and friendly. 

Strawberry Waffle with tons of fresh berries and 2 big scope of ice cream is good photo opp...though it looks better than it tasted but it is A-OK 

Lemony Sweet Crepe simple and tasty, with a really really lemony twist... my friend loved that... I steal a little piece but I have to say in order to have a fair review... he needed to let me have more! 

White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory is A-OK too... 

Good casual place for dessert and a coffee... and the Waffles are good to be shared!"}
