{"text":"Nice little place for breakfast. We go here on a regular basis for late breakfast. Have some gluten-free options and standards as well. Service isn't always the fastest but our waitress is always very nice, the food is consistently good, and you don't have to wait for a table. Nice to get a coffee or tea and chat while you wait for food. On nice days it's great to sit outside and people watch. Recommend the salmon potato hash and huevos rancheros."}
{"text":"I think they have great food here. I have never actually went in and sat down to order but when I ordered take out, on several occasions, the people answering the phone and that wait on you when you come in are always super friendly. The food is super good too. I've never had their eggs but all of their lunch items are delicious and great portions for the cost I think. It's a cute place inside."}
{"text":"Went the other day for breakfast and was taken aback by the prices. My friend convinced me to stay, but I should have listened to my gut. Got the huevos rancheros - very underwhelmed (even though it was starred as a 'favorite'... really??).  Salsa from a jar on the side. The cook's ringing of the dang bell in that place got on my nerves as did the way he talked to his staff. Service was fine - and got a few apologetic glances when the cook yelled again about something stupid.  Like the previous reviewer, I wanted another tortilla - 1 and a half flour tortillas... you'd think it would be easier to use two. My guess is cost cutting. What difference does 1/2 a tortilla make?? Any way, who cares. Won't be back. Oh- and I peered at the cooks supplies and recognized a lot of labels from Aldi's. Interesting!"}
{"text":"Great meal. Great service. Fresh, tasty breakfast. Chef even sent out complimentary banana bread. In town from Boston. Didn't expect to find food this good in the middle of a strip shopping center. Kudo's to the chef."}
{"text":"This was at least our 6th visit to Paper Gallos, and by far our worst experience, both with service and the food. We were there for almost 2 hours for brunch, and my girlfriends Popeyes's omelet was way over cooked and her toast was burnt on one side. I decided to try the fish tacos, and was disappointed. Something in them was very sour. Did not enjoy them at all. Since we waited for almost 1:30 hours for our food, we didn't complain. We wont be back."}
{"text":"What a shame, it was a beautiful morning.  Until we decided to eat here.  Service was SLOW... really SLOW.  Our coffee was Luke warm at best, and after refills it was still NOT HOT.  We waited almost 1 hour for our breakfast.  There was the wrong cheese on my friends breakfast sandwich.  I had asked for \"fresh\" egg whites (not the substitute kind) and was told she'd ask... never heard anything more.. breakfast came and I did got egg whites, so I assumed all was good.  UNTIL I received my bill... I was being charge an EXTRA $4 for my egg whites!!!  I went to pay my bill and asked the waitress why she didn't inform me of the extra charge (it is not listed on the menu) and she went to get the cook- who came out very defensive and ARROGANT... I told him I didn't think it was fair for me to pay extra since it was not listed on menu.  He argued with me telling me I would go to JAIL if I did not pay!!!  Are you serious????  I will never return here, and I urge fellow breakfast connoisseurs to go elsewhere for a more reasonable priced breakfast where they actually CARE about their customers!"}
{"text":"I will echo a number of the comments below.... service was HORRIBLE.  Took us 40 minutes to get breakfast and there was only one other table in the restaurant.  Portions were small. Food was just ok.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"We have eaten at PapaGallo three times and the food has been excellent each time.  My wife especially appreciates the gluten-free options.  Food prep can be very slow due to small kitchen and apparently only one cook.  On one occasion we got a server who was indifferent but on the other two visits servers were great.  If you're not in a hurry, this is a very good place for breakfasts and lunches."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful service. Apocalyptically slow service and laughably small portions. Avoid at all costs go to moes or Starbucks"}
{"text":"I have never written a negative Yelp review but I am now compelled to do so.  20 minutes for coffee, over and hour for food.  The service from the start was unfriendly, the food and check were delivered without a lone word.  I ordered the poached eggs with Hollandaise sauce.  The yolks were overcooked to the point of being dry.  Kill me.  The sauce was scant, thin and watery.  Two tables that came in after us were done and or had left before our food ever arrived.  Our menus were closed, signaling ready to order, before our coffee came.  No one bothered to ask us how our meals were.  A tremendous disappointment.  My wife and I are travelers and we eat out constantly.  Trust my street cred when I seriously recommend you explore other breakfast options in the area."}
{"text":"This was my fourth time going here and most definitely my last. I ordered the breakfast sandwich with just egg and bacon on it. My mother ordered a side of home fries and sausage. The fact that they only had four tables with customers including us, one would think they'd get their food within 15 minutes... Not this place. A regular came in with his two children at least 20 minutes after us and they were greeted so warmly. As we were there a half hour waiting for our food the older waitress brought the regular and his kids their food. Our waitress then comes over a few minutes after I witnessed that and asks \"Oh, did you say you wanted bacon on your sandwich?\" then answered herself \"Yeah, you did.\" before I could say yes and she went back into the kitchen. My mother and I decided we were leaving. I told the waitress \"We've been here 45 minutes and the guy you know over there got his food almost as soon as he walked in. We're leaving.\" She said she understood and the chef manning the kitchen was new. It was weird she said that when we were there a month and a half before and he was working with the owner. So we left and went down the street to Shouf's Cafe. Let me say if you want friendly and fast service go there. They were busy, but we were seated right away and had our food within 15 minutes of ordering. Papa Gallo is a complete disaster."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place.  They have gluten free options for breakfast which can be hard to find.  BUT every single time we got it takes such a long time to get the food.  There are up-charges that are never advised up front.  They offered fresh syrup for pancakes and I said yes to find out it was $3.00 extra per order for a small side of syrup.  I added sausage to our daughters pancake and it was a spicy sausage link, no one advised when ordering it was spicy and it was clearly for our child so we didn't eat it.    Breakfast for a family of 4 was close to $50.00 and it took us an hour to get food.  The food was ok, but not worth an hour wait or the cost.  It was the same the last time we had visited.  They are nice and the food is good, but it's just not worth the wait and price."}
{"text":"Had a real awful meal here.  Was excited based on the review and menu, which features huevos rancheros.  We both ordered huevos, the first order came out about 20 minutes before the second, turning a quick breakfast into an awkward ordeal where one of us was done ages before the other.  Both had the same traits -- eggs WAY over done (what's so hard about an over easy egg?), smothered in cheese and what seemed like ortega salsa.  Unaltered black beans straight from the can.  A couple corn tortillas underneath.  Totally lacking in inspiration and effort.    The equivalent of a 15th century artist who never saw a manatee sketching a picture based on oral accounts... wanting huevos and getting a sea monster..."}
{"text":"At the start, I'm a diner fan.  I really enjoy the morning experience at a breakfast place.  I've been a regular for years around the area but that all changed with the discovery of PapaGallo.  I'm hooked and I've introduced friends to the experience.  My biggest concern in raving is that too many others will decide to make this a favorite morning place.  Len, the chef and owner, goes out of his way to go above and beyond what's even on an impressive menu.  He seems to always be willing to create something new and a bit different than the usual.  The service is done by all with a friendly smile.....a perfect way to start the day!  The complaints re the wait time might be true for someone in a major rush.  Those people might do better with a sandwich from McDonalds.  If you want a great start to your day, this is definitely the place to start!"}
{"text":"Chef's Len and Craig are the best kept secret in town for lunch and breakfast. If you have not tried this place yet, you should. I always leave it to the chef to \"make me something\" and it's never a disappointment. Be sure to ask for Chef Craig's homemade bread pudding! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"My neighbors love this place so I thought I'd give it a try. I walked in and my first impressions were that it was virtually empty and really warm (temperature) inside.   The waitress came over quickly enough, but stumbled when asked a simple question about one of the items on the menu: How are the eggs prepared? No biggie.  Coffee was great, except that when I asked for a refill, I was told that the pot was empty and they were closing soon. That rubbed me the wrong way. She later took the coffee off my receipt, so... The food took 45 min to arrive. Unacceptable considering there was only one table occupied when I arrived.  Food was good, but did not wow me. I ordered the cannonball omelet. I am fairly certain they used regular breakfast sausage links instead of spicy sausage. The omelet was on the small side and came with one and a half pieces of toast. No potatoes.  $9.50. A bit high in my opinion.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try this restaurant for years. Went for breakfast on a Sunday. Closed Sunday.  Went last Saturday and it was awful. Awful food and awful service.  After waiting for our food for over 30 minutes I had an omelette that was burnt. What made it worse, was the omelette was $10 - plus the coffee was $3.50. I figured I would at least get some thick Italian bread as toast - nope, just regular bread. Not sure what makes this an 'Italian Cucina' either - there was nothing Italian about the food. That was a first and last for me!"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic... Asian chicken salad was above average"}
{"text":"Not a good experience. Service was slow and not attentive.  Food finally came out, which was incomplete. I ordered the beet and avocado salad which was one beet sliced, the avocado was missing. Told waitress who brought it back with 4 slices of avocado that were completely brown and soft not edible. $12.50 for a small crapy salad. This place is over priced and food is sub par!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place ! We often stop by on Saturday mornings following a workout. I always get the steak and eggs with a side of home fries and cinnamon toast. The Steak is a NY strip and it's always seasoned and prepared to perfection. We were there yesterday and getting our food didn't take long at all but the chef gave everyone there warm mini donuts to hold us over. I definitely recommend making this a breakfast spot that you check out."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service whether it's breakfast or lunch. Absolutely love eating here. Highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"God help you if you ask for an additional tortilla.  You will hear the chef bitch and moan."}
{"text":"I was tempted to try PapaGallo by Munch's review in the Post Gazette (http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sectionfront/life/munch-goes-to-papagallo-cucina-308978/) and decided to finally give it a try when a CBS local deal was available ($20 gift certificate for $10).   To say I was disappointed could be an understatement.  It didn't seem overly busy when I arrived at 8am so I'm not sure why there was such a problem with, well, everything.  My friend and I ordered the same thing: the Triple Berry Pancakes with sides of bacon and home fries.  Seems simple enough.  Or so we thought until we waited nearly an hour for our food.  And then when we finally did get our food, we each only got one pancake while the chef made more (we should have each received 2 with or order).  The bacon strips were all cooked together in one clump.  The potatoes were okay.  The pancakes, when we did finally get them, were really good.  Which is the only reason I gave two stars.  The service was atrocious.  There wasn't even a waitress when I first arrived.  I had only ordered a water to drink and my friend ordered a water and a coffee.  It seemed at times like the waitress was purposely avoiding our table as my friend had to practically get her own refills.  I don't know why our food order took so long, but no apology was ever made during our wait.  On our way out, after the longest breakfast ever and after we had paid our bill, both the chef and the waitress apologized.  But it felt like too little too late.  I would like to go back to try other items on the menu but I'm not sure I will based on this first experience."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went for brunch yesterday....very friendly server and chef...my fiancé had the steak sandwich and fries and I had the salmon hash...OMG...DELISH!!! Only complaints...service is slow when it comes to refilling coffee and getting food. It was fairly empty and it took a good 35 minutes for food, however it was well worth the wait..salmon was amazing ...poached eggs were a little overdone for me, but still good. Fiancé loved his sandwich . We will definitely be back and often"}
{"text":"I recently had lunch at Papa Gallo with my husband and daughter. I had heard some good things and some not so good things, but decided to try it for ourselves. I must say we were very disappointed with our experience. First when we walked in the door we were greeted very coldly by the receptionist who also happened to be our waitress. Her social skills were sorely lacking and quite frankly shouldn't really work with the public directly because her personality left a lot to desired. So obviously our first impression wasn't a very good one. We each ordered a soup/ sandwich combo which was alright, nothing special and the soup was lukewarm at best. Sad to say we won't be going back to Papa Gallo and certainly wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been to Papa Gallo a handful of times since they opened a few years ago the latest being on a recent Saturday afternoon with a friend. PG is only open for breakfast and lunch so I tend to stop by when I'm craving a hearty breakfast. The restaurant is small with only a few tables and booths.  In addition to the regular menu, they have daily specials written on a chalk board. The atmosphere is homey and reminescent of a simpler time when people would sit for hours reading a newspaper and drinking coffee over breakfast withot the distraction of cell phones, t.v.s and ipads. The owner/chef is friendly and frequently comes out to say hello and hold the door for you. The food has always been on the mark. My latest love, the triple berry pancakes. Light, fluffy and full of melt in your mouth warm berries. As always, the dishes are accompanied by a small fruit salad garnish. All in all, a great break from the crowded, fast paced breakfast joints like the Original Pancake House or Pamelas. Go to PG to sit back and enjoy your meal and your company."}
{"text":"An enjoyable breakfast and lunch experience.  Len, the owner and chef, always makes you feel welcome and does his best to cater to all of your needs.  Establishments of this type deserve the support of the dining public."}
{"text":"Disappointed by the service and food.  I wanted to try this place out after seeing a coupon in the mail.  Arrived to a completely empty restaraunt.  Not a suprise!  The service was horribly slow and food was so greasy.  Ordered a cup of coffee that was extremely watery.  As a group of 2, it took more than 40 minutes to get our food.  I got super greasy eggs and a rubbery pancake and it cost me more than $10!  The portions were pitifully small too. Dad got chorizo and eggs and was underwhelmed as well.  The entire time, the kitchen staff was talking about us and laughing.  Overall a bad expire ce and won't visit again. Overpriced and low quality.  Much better off going to a local Carnegie diner where there is good food, much better service, and portions are better for a much better price.  I'm not too suprised that this place was empty after my expirence."}
{"text":"Simply put, it's perfect. Affordable, fresh, friendly. The staff treats you like family and every dish we ordered was crafted with care. Len holds the helm in an open kitchen where he puts his heart and soul into truly delicious menu items as well as a rotating selection of blackboard specials. I would recommend this neighborhood treasure to anyone I've ever met ever. A truly special place that would only disappoint the disappointing. There is nothing wrong with this place, period. Well done!"}
{"text":"The relaxed friendliness and prices of a diner, the food quality of a fine restaurant.  This has become my favorite place for breakfast, although it is a 15 minute drive for me. Notice that almost all the negative reviews focus on slow service. This is not the place to go if you are in a hurry, but good food is worth waiting for. The chef cooks the food for each order completely from scratch. You won't see a pile of home fries or bacon on the griddle like you will at a diner. I have experienced nothing but prompt, attentive, and very friendly service from the wait staff. To paraphrase Alan Watts, you cannot save time, you can only spend it, and MacDonald's is a horrible place to spend time; spend it a PapaGallo Cucina instead! Despite one of the reviews I read, there are good vegetarian options on the menu; perhaps they were added after that review, I don't know. I have ordered three different vegetarian breakfast items straight from the menu, including the only decent Huevos Rancheros I have yet found in Pittsburgh. $3.50 for a side may seem excessive, but the menu prices are lower than you will find at Eat -n- Park, and the quality significantly better."}
{"text":"We decided to return and update our review while we're here. The food is still excellent,  but it does take time. Be prepared to wait 45 minutes after your order is placed before the food arrives."}
{"text":"Reviews were mostly good so we have it a try. The waitress seemed like she was having a bad day, and definitely did not want to wait on us. The food was okay, but definitely not worth the price. Coffee was eh.  Wouldn't recommend. I really love brunch so this was disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been trying local breakfast eateries recently. Hands down this was the best food, service, and atmosphere. First of all it's a PRETTY little restaurant decorated with a Tuscan theme that I would love in my own kitchen. We were greeted warmly and told to sit wherever we liked. They were not very busy so the service was quick and attentive. All food is made (exceptionally well) to order so it took some time and I suspect if they were busy you might have to wait a little longer fir your food. The good news is IT IS SO WORTH THE WAIT!!!! I ordered the Huevos Rancheros. They were beautifully plated and presented with a lovely fresh fruit garnish. Almost too pretty to eat, but the taste lived up to the visual! Two warm soft tortillas topped with two fully cooked (I like them this way but you can request, medium or soft or however you like your eggs) eggs, smothered in a delicious chunky salsa and topped with warm gooey melted Monterey Jack cheese. On the side, topping the folded second tortilla was a small (but perfect size) serving of spicy black beans. I left with a full and happy belly!   Oh and the other great thing? I have noticed that even the breakfast places with good food, usually have mediocre coffee at best, and some have downright awful coffee. PapaGallo Cucina coffee was quite good and I am a confirmed coffee snob!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the ambience is very comfortable. The pesto chicken panini is great . The downside is every time I have gone (3 times so far) the service has been painfully slow, even getting a server to come to the table once can take 20 minutes. This is for lunch, I've not been there for breakfast. But they are very pleasant people and once you get your food it is a good experience."}
{"text":"Wow! I am shocked at the bad experiences here. I've been there twice now for breakfast and both times were very good. I even took my mother in law after the first time because I was so excited I found a place that I thought she would like! I have a young toddler who can be a handful but they made sure that we were comfortable and happy, and their high chair was clean which is a big thing in itself for us. The chef who I think may also be the owner was SO sweet! Both times we went he made sure to acknowledge my little one. I do think that maybe they get busy quickly as they seemed to be trying to accommodate lunch pickup orders already and we were there around 10:30 or so. They seemed like a lot of their items for specials were cook-all-day type of things. I am a big fan of their huevos rancheros and my kid even enjoyed the black beans from it. My mother in law loved the veggie omelette."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of Bridgeville's GREATEST lil secrets !  I stopped in here for breakfast this morning ,And was pleasantly surprised. The Staff was very attentive and friendly. the food is out of this world ! Great little Italian Atmosphere. All Homemade dishes. Sheeesh , I'm talkin like I work here . LOL  The price's are a little on the high side ., but for what your getting , this is a great deal. Quality will always outweigh cheap in my book. Easy free parking , They even gave us FREE little cinnamon rolls fresh out of the oven !  5 Stars Here .I'll be back soon !"}
{"text":"A coworker and I stopped in to get a \"quick\" lunch. We waited 50 minutes for a reuben and fish tacos. There were 2 other tables seated in the entire place and 1 to go order on the front desk. Food was decent at best. Server was kind but the cook seriously needs to learn how to multitask. The order that we placed should have taken 15 minutes TOPS and that is pushing it. Will never be back."}
{"text":"I usually never review- I leave that up to my husband.  But this time I feel the need. I will say the food was good and fresh however so overpriced. I asked for tomatoes with my breakfast and was charged $3.50 for 2 measly slices. I don't mind paying extra- actually I usually expect it- but I think this was a little overpriced. Also, an up-charge to poach eggs? Really.  A small fruit cup - $3.50 - with 8 grapes, 2 blackberries and minced cantaloupe. Um? Where's the rest?!? For that reason, not worth the prices, we won't go back. Luckily we had a Groupon - which made it somewhat better."}
{"text":"This is my third time to this fresh little cafe and each time I go, I feel a disappointment. The menu is small, yet interesting and intriguing. I decided to try \"munch's\" recommendation ...the \"spicy\" omelet made with \"Italian sausage\" per the waitress and menu....and pepper jack cheese. To my dismay, sliced little breakfast sausage and mild cheese in a small omelet. The waitress was cute/sweet yet needs some coaching. She didn't offer anything else for her (or the chefs) mistake. High prices, small portions, very average food. For a good, hearty breakfast, go down the road a mile to Gab n Eat!!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch on a Friday with my mom. I ordered the half deli sandwich and a half ceaser salad while my mom ordered the eggs Benedict. It took 40 minuets for my meal to come. The waitress said that her meal was in its way. I finished my meal and just saw the cook start to crack the eggs for my Mom's meal. We were on a time crunch asked for the check. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Too expensive, very slow service, and only average food.  $16 for breakfast is just too much.  The home fries were very plain. Only about 5 or 6 customers but had to wait 40 minutes for food.  I will say that the \"popeye\" omelet was good, but it's not worth they wait or price."}
{"text":"The food was good but they a la carte you. $44 for 3 people for 2 breakfasts and a small salad (no drinks) plus tip.  I wish they would tell you there is an upcharge when they offer you something that later becomes an upcharge.  Doubt I'll go back.  If I do I will ask on every item if it's an up charge before they give it to me."}
{"text":"Just had the worst brunch I've ever had. French toast tasted like whatever it was cooked on hadn't been cleaned very well before they cooked the French toast on it. Everyone's portions were small and overpriced. $3 for fries on the side??? They tasted like they ordered them from McDonald's. Would have rather gone to Eat n Park considering the $60 check and the ~40 minute wait for our food. Kitchen Nightmares candidate anyone?"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch spot.   Love the decor, friendly staff and the chef/owner who isn't afraid of a special request.  The food is beyond amazing.  The flavors are well balanced and the portions are generous and filling.  This is a MUST GO."}
{"text":"There seem to be some polarized opinions on PapaGallo, which is a total bummer. Cute little breakfast/lunch spot, with daily specials and cookies and a welcoming atmosphere. The service was a little slow, but the waitress was super friendly and I was with good company so I hardly noticed.  The Greek salad blew away my expectations. The veggies were fresh and crisp, the tomatoes were sliced and grilled, and the dressing brought a comfortable balance to the rest of the medley (crumbled cheese, olives, etc.). Served with garlic bread to soak up anything left over on the plate.  I couldn't resist trying a peanut butter blossom, mostly because it had an unorthodox two(!) Hershey kisses on top. You should probably try one, too. You know, just to make sure."}
{"text":"This was not a good experience.  Went for lunch had a pay half certificate, put it on the table and ordered half an hour later a tiny wlittle burnt sandwich comes out $9.50 no sides couldn't even see the corned beef. The waitress waits until she brings the check and says oh by the way we canceled those we don't take them anymore never said a word before we ordered and the expiration date was Oct. 6th. Food was way overpriced and not good would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Good stuff but don't be in a hurry.  Have been here a few times since my last review and the kitchen usually has one and sometimes two people handling the cooking.  If you come in before eight the waitstaff is not there yet, just Chef Len.  Always get some fresh fruit with my order.  On my last visit had the Eggs Benedict which were perfect.  The waitress did apologize for them taking so long but I did not come in for a fast food meal and know it takes a while because a couple of people ordered just before me."}
{"text":"Stopped by Papa Gallo for the first time yesterday, and I definitely won't be back. We arrived right before 11, probably around 10:45ish. We were seated right away, but it took about a half hour for anyone to even acknowledge us, and we had to tell them we were ready to order. Around 12 a waitress stopped by to tell us she was going to check on our order, but she never did. Fast forward to 12:30, and we were still sitting there without our food so we left. Pretty disappointing, because the food looked & smelled good, but it's not worth going for the terrible service."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere!  We had been wanting to try Papas for almost a year, crazy schedules finally aligned.  Had the BEST fish tacos ever and their daily specials are great too.  We will be back, many items still to taste!"}
{"text":"Walked in, sat down at counter, was totally ignored for ten minutes.  Another person walked in, was greeted like a long lost family member and served within one minute as I was sitting there waiting.  Place is dirty and service is abysmal.  NEVER AGAIN...lost me forever"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!! I don't know my favorite part to start ... I guess it starts when you walk in the door... it immediately feels like home. You are greeted immediately with a warm smile and prompt service. I always like to sit at the bar looking into the kitchen.... and then you meet Len the owner and only chef I have seen here. Always always welcoming... smiling...i feel like calling him uncle Len lol. It's a wonderful experience.  ... and then! You open the menu and learn about specials of the day... there's much to choose from. ALWAYS made fresh and with love. Healthy... flavorful...DELICIOUS!! I highly highly recommended this place over and over."}
{"text":"Where has this gem been for the last seven years if my life?  Or should I say, where have I been.  My wife and I referred to this wonderful restaurant by a friend from church.  It was an awesome experience.  We arrived between breakfast and lunch.  The owner greeted use and we got to talking about the specials.  I had a Seared Salmon Hash with Poached Eggs.  I can't stop raving about how good it was.  My wife, who hates anything other than eggs and bacon, kept paoching my food.  So you know it was good.  Everything is made to order with fresh ingredients.  As we waited, the fragrance of the Salmon and Hash filled the area ...my mouth was watering and I wasn't disappointed in the least.  I'm thinking of going back for lunch today ...it was that good.  Great job Len!!!   Frank thanks for the referral."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very traditional Italian. I imagine what it is like somewhere in Tuscany. The waitress was really nice too and even though she was by herself always filled our coffee cups. I ordered a vegetable omelet, which was fresh and cooked perfectly. The taste was fantastic. The only problem was the size, as I was still hungry when I finished. The other issue? The price. A tiny bowl of fruit was $3.50. And a side of tomato slices for my wife, just two slices, was $3.50. That's a little much. The food, atmosphere, and service was great. The price however will probably prevent us from coming back."}
{"text":"NOT VEGAN OR VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY. Walk in and the smell of bacon greets you.  Really nothing on the menu is suitable for vegetarians.  I ordered the home fries, which were described on the menu as grilled potatoes, and lo and behold they turned out to be potatoes covered in pieces of bacon.   I told the staff I was a vegetarian, the cook politely offered to make me a new batch of potatoes, but everything is cooked on the same grill.   Ergo, the next batch of potatoes were infused with bacon grease and residual bacon bits.     They didn't offer an apology, or like any decent restaurant, comp the bacony potatoes, or apply a discount or coupon for future visit.  Nothing.  We were charged the full bill as if our meal was satisfactory.  Our return business was not important to them.  I also ordered a cinnamon roll and what I received was a cinnamon muffin.   There is a difference.  A cinnamon roll is a soft chewy rolled up magically delicious thing covered in lovely gooey icing that leaves your fingers sticky.  A cinnamon muffin is a dry, crispy, cinnamon flavored MUFFIN.   I thought perhaps they made a mistake so I mentioned that it was a cinnamon roll I had ordered and they said \"yes, we make it a cinnamon muffin\".  So why not put \"cinnamon muffin\" on the menu so I know what I'm getting into?   False advertising.     This was the worst breakfast I have ever had in my life.  Prior to this, the worst breakfast I'd ever had was in a dingy hostel in the worst part of Rome, in which the breakfast was fake juice and a crust of bread.   Well done, PapaGallo.  Also the obsession with rooster decor was a little creepy."}
{"text":"I paid $10 for two plain pancakes, The pancakes were extremely burned on the outside and doughy On the inside. It seems like this chef probably used to take pride in his food but probably stopped doing that a long time ago and now is just open for the sake of being open.  They will brag about how everything is \"homemade\" but who cares if it isn't good?  There is a first watch cafe less than a mile from here, I would suggest you go there for your breakfast instead."}
