{"text":"Subpar!!!  go to McD's instead... same food, but cheaper!!!   Took 20 min. to get food n only 6 tables seated while I was there!   WTF... ppl came in after me got served first!  What, burger n fries 2 complicated?!?"}
{"text":"On a quest to find a plate full of grease this morning, I stumbled into San Remo's. I was looking for a quick, no frills place to eat, have some coffee, sober up and this was the perfect place. They serve breakfast all day on the weekends and their breakfast is cheap. Like french toast, two eggs and two sausages for $4.95 cheap. Service was friendly, quick and I didn't even have to ask for a refill--thumbs up. I love that they have Teas Pete's at every table, I don't know why but that makes me happy.

All in all, a solid spot for a quick and cheap breakfast. This place reminds me of the the local diners I grew up going to with my parents and I love that feeling. In and out within 30 minutes and a  meal and coffee for under seven bones? Count me in for next time!"}
{"text":"The one thing about Charlotte that I miss. I loved our waitress who always knew me and my boyfriend were pulling up. She would have our favorite booth cleared off and our mountain dews ready for us. 

My absolute favorite things to order during the late night menu was the pita burger and breakfast (yes breakfast after midnight!) It's a bit quiet during the late night which is expected among most 24/7 diners. 

I also had the dinner menu before and it was just as lovely. 

If you want friendly faces and great food that is better then mcdonalds when your drunk at 2am, go here!"}
{"text":"We recently gave San Remo another shot. I scored a solid, inexpensive breakfast while JK had a decent chopped steak and salad with good house-made blue cheese dressing. Our waitress was competent, friendly and on top of refills throughout our meal. I'm not a fan of the flat screens in every corner, but that can be a plus when you're dining alone - also they reduced the volume on the one closest to us as we requested. San Remo will probably always be a bit of a dive, but that's not a bad thing. Hopefully we'll continue to see improvements here and there at this low-key diner."}
{"text":"Wonderful, regular old diner food. The coffee is always hot, and the breakfast is beautifully greasy. It's cheap and wonderful, and the servers are the usual sweet, kind of country diner servers you'd expect for a place like this.

I went there one night after an all-night insane tattoo session, and it was great. I had cheesy hash browns and hot chocolate at 4:30 in the morning. It is a happy memory.

I haven't been to San Remo in a while, but it's on my mind because I have a date coming up there tomorrow night. I'm stoked. I'm going to go fantasize about deep fried starches now."}
{"text":"Good ol' country style breakfast at an affordable price.  The servers are sweet older ladies with really sweet tea (which is the best).  I went with my sister and my brother-in-law and it I can attest that it is a perfect place for families.  I can't say that it is the best breakfast I have ever tasted, it's basically staple stuff, but the service and the prices make up for it.  I will go during the week the next time around, only because I want to avoid the huge church crowd."}
{"text":"I've grown up in Charlotte and have always gone to San Remos for late night or morning grub. They closed for a while, but they've reopened now under the same name. We thought we'd give it a whirl and see if it had improved any. We walked in and the setup is the same, but you can tell they've cleaned it up alot and repainted etc. I didn't recognize any of the employees, which was a good thing that gave me hope, but after we got our food, our enthusiasm quickly faded. Again, we tried to order simple things that would be a safe bet. I got a cheeseburger with fries and he got 2 eggs over medium, grits and sausage links. Neither were tasty. My burger was a charred frozen patty and the fries were terrible no matter how much ketchup and salt I applied. His eggs were alright, but the sausage links were horrible, gritty things. The tea was tasty, but despite me saying \"no lemons\" every time the waitress refilled my glass, she still kept adding them. sigh- I miss the San Remos of my youth."}
{"text":"San Remo is sandwiched right next to the Landmark (literally, they are probably separated by a few inches).  While they are about the same to get into, San Remo is a whole lot easier to park at and get out of because of a much larger lot (Landmark shares a tiny lot with several other stores).  The menu at San Remo is also a lot smaller than that at the Landmark, but the quality of the food is pretty similar.

When you look at the menu at San Remo, you're going to get a couple of pages.  The place is your typical restaurant, really, and there is nothing special about it.  The staff is generally nice, but it completely depends on who you get and what their day was like, so on that front it's no different than anywhere else you go.

I'll also agree with others who have posted in that it's completely about the starch.  Hash browns, biscuits, grits, gravy, you name it and you can get it (I've actually never been for anything but breakfast).  You can probably get most of those deep-fried.  It's a bit like Mel's Diner meets the Twilight Zone.  No matter what time you go, it seems dark.

The food itself is good, though you can feel it clogging your arteries as it goes down."}
{"text":"The omelet and hash browns were just a pile of warm calories but the biscuit was good and the service was friendly.
