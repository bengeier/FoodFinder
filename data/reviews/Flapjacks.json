{"text":"This place is amazing! We were out for a Sunday drive and thought we would give it a try based on the Yelp review history.  We weren't disappointed!  My husband ordered the Blueberry pancakes and I ordered the Mixed nut pancakes.  They were the lightest, fluffiest most amazing cakes I have ever had.  It isn't a big place, and however they move customers through at a steady rate.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I cook a better breakfast at home! Scrambled eggs not scrambled but baked in formed mold. Might have been substitute eggs with an oily taste? Flapjacks were made from a mix with water powder? Rosemary potatoes had no flavor...nothing had flavor. Friend asked for peanut butter on side which never came...
Cheap,easy,bland...worst breakfast at a breakfast place I've ever had."}
{"text":"We are staying at the inn at eagle mountain  and ventured into town for breakfast. We decided to try Flapjacks, despite the 3.5 star rating. The restaurant is very clean. We were seated right away by a very pleasant girl. She didn't take our drink order immediately, but went to the kitchen and came back with a small plate of sliced banana and Cheerios for our baby! I have never been to a restaurant where they did that. 
We ordered coffee, the house specialty pancake with apples and nuts, and the pecan French toast. All was great. The French toast had strawberries and banana on top. I have to say that the pancake was better. It's unlike any pancake I've ever had. When it comes out, it's really puffy, then flattens out a bit as it cools. It takes about 15 minutes to bake, yes bake. Don't order this if you are in a rush. Server warned of that beforehand.  
Excellent service. Great food. Good coffee and atmosphere. Would eat here again and definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I eat breakfast here every time I am in town. I love the baked pancakes. I have never found them anywhere else and they are delicious. They take awhile to prepare but they are worth the wait and you know they are always fresh."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst example of customer service and courtesy I've seen in AZ. Coming from Texas, we appreciate good service and great food hand-in-hand. I believe this place forgot that customers keep them in business. We waited against a wall while the waitresses didn't acknowledge us like we were lepars...we left fast and headed to Taps Grill!!! Hands down...we won't come back and will definitely share our experience!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! It was so delicious and the baked apple pancake was a must-have. You won't  be disappointed.  The service was excellent. They make you feel like family when you come in. Definitely stop in if you're  in the neighborhood,  or make a special trip."}
{"text":"Went to eat there the first time, the waitress was cleaning the table and stopped and started to serve other customers  instead of seating us down. Not professional at all."}
{"text":"I like sitting at the country.  I was a little disappointed that their gluten free menu did not include any type of pancakes or bread.  Great service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"BUSY!  Great service considering how slammed they were.  Food was good."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Fountin Hills bar none! Very busy on the weekends so plan to go early. Excellent service and a great selection of breakfast entree's"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  I'm a local and so I've tried all the breakfast joints in town. This one wins hands-down. I try to make it my destination every Saturday.  Everything you order here is divine.  They even make scrambled eggs taste like a fluffy little bite of heaven.  The staff is hilarious, witty, and hardworking.  It's a small restaurant and during the \"snow bird\" season can get very busy; you may have to wait to get a seat, but its so worth it!  Once in, sit back, relax, enjoy the witty repartee of the waitresses, the company your with and be amazed by the food.  In summer there is usually no waiting but the standard is still high!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to just take a drive out to Fountain Hills as it was a beautiful Arizona day. We saw Flapjacks on Yelp and the reviews seemed very good, so that became our destination. When we arrived the place was very crowded, which we took as a good sign. We waited a few minutes while they cleared a table and were seated. We were told that they would be closing soon so there would not be baked pancakes available to order. After what seemed like a long time, our orders were taken. I ordered pancakes, as I figured a place called Flapjacks would have to have really good pancakes. The time it took to receive our order was way too long. The service is amazingly slow. The server was very attentive, refilling coffee. Finally the food arrived. The pancakes were a major disappointment. Instead of fluffy and light, they were thin and chewy. I always am able to cut pancakes with a fork. These required a knife. 
NY wife had the French toast with bananas. She said it was delicious

When you only do one thing, breakfast, you should be really good at that one thing. Unfortunately, in my opinion, Flapjacks fails at that one thing. We would not return."}
{"text":"This is definitely the place for something a little different.  If you can find it .. don't listen to google maps ... Flapjacks is on the opposite side of the street!

My friend had the Banana Nut oven baked pancake and I had the Pecan Crusted french toast.  The oven-baked pancake was huge and the french toast was tasty.  The staff was very friendly and the owner came over to chat for a few minutes as well.  He is definitely passionate about his food!  My only complaint would be about the coffee cups .. they smelled like they might have been dried by a sour smelling dish towel.  Other than that, the food was good and definitely filling."}
{"text":"Went out with my wife and daughter. I had the jack combo (2 eggs, potatoes, sourdough, and ham), it was good, can't really mess that up. Coffee was great temp, I could drink it almost right away, not boiling hot. Daughter had kids meal with eggs and bacon. The server forgot to bring her apple juice until almost the end of the meal, we couldn't really get the server's attention as they seemed to be more concerned with other guests. My wife order the California omelet. Avocado was hard, not ripe, not edible. 

My rating comes mostly from the service, as the food was ok. The server seemed to be focused on many of the other guests. It seemed to be a very \"local\" spot, as the server looked like she knew many of the other guests. We weren't even finished ordering and the server tried to walk away twice. Forgot the apple juice. Barely came back to the table. When we were checking out, we mentioned, politely, that the avocado wasn't ripe. Instead of any sort of apology, the server said, \"ok, I'll tell them.\" And walked away again. 

I will not visit this place again, and I do not recommend this place unless you are a \"local\", then you will get plenty of good service."}
{"text":"Great food! Very nice staff! Everyone is welcoming and cheery ! The oven baked pancakes are crazy good!! If you are in fountain hills, this is THE place to breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Overated, Overpriced, and Underserved!  Pancakes and eggs are nothing special unless you count waiting 35 minutes for them.  To be clear..4 pancakes and 4 eggs over easy...35 minutes.  You would have a better experience at Dennys!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Friendly staff who really appreciate you showing up to eat, plus great food!  Nice combination that will bring us back many times in the months and years to come.

This is definitely a breakfast kind of place.  We arrived on Saturday in July about 9:30 and there was not wait at all.  I think the place had just cleared out.

I suggest that if you come at prime time, plan some shopping at the nearby Ace Hardware and supermarket if you can.  That'll make the time fly by until your turn to be seated arrives.

My wife ordered a skillet dish and I ordered an omelet.  Very, very tasty.  I'll try one of the pancakes next time.

{"text":"Try their lemon pancakes! Amazing! Their scramblers are awesome and we always have great service."}
{"text":"Some of my golfing buddies were visiting, and we were heading for We-Ko-Pa for a day of golfing.  It was an early tee time, so we decided to stop in Fountain Hills for breakfast. Since we are always trying to find a good breakfast, and aren't afraid to try new places, we decided to stop at Flapjacks. It is located in the Basha's shopping area, and not to difficult to find. 

Now we are all big breakfast people.  We like big country style  breakfasts - which we hope will get us through to Happy Hour time. Their menu was interesting, had a number of different choices, and we all ordered something different.  One of our group is a picky eater - actually he is a pain in the a**.  But the waitress was very nice and accommodating, and the food actually came as he had ordered it.  

That said, we were all slightly disappointed.  The servings were small and the food was average. The two pancakes that were included with the meals were very good, but only about twice the size of dollar pancakes.  There was nothing special or outstanding to recommend the place - and it is to far out of the way to make a special trip for breakfast unless you live in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"I keep coming back. My friend tells me, lets go to that place with the good omelets; my favorites are the pancakes. I took my husband here and he loves it! He then took his out of town friends here and  for the last month they had their \" breakfast club\" here several times. This is still my favorite place for Breakfast in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"Went to this quaint little restaurant this morning.  There was a line out the door (kinda).  I didn't notice the sign on the door that said to put our name on the sheet outside, we were 4th on the list and waited about 15 minutes and let me tell you it was worth it. I ordered an omelet with the rosemary potatoes and a side of sausage. The omelet was well proportioned with just the right amount of filling and the sausage was quite tasty. My wife ordered the oven baked cranberry and orange pancake and let me tell you it was out of this world. It's was not your ordinary pancake it was more like a souffle.  It came out to the table or was about 3 or 4 inches tall and settled into a bowl shape. The edges had a nice crispness and the center was not dense, perfectly cooked.  It filled the whole plate and smelled so good when it came out.  Fortunately my wife let me have some, she called it heaven on a plate. It was insanely delicious.  After we were done I mentioned to the server that it almost made me reach over and grab the leftovers from the table next to us. It was that good.  I think we will be eating there again on this vacation."}
{"text":"Yikes!  My husband and I were venturing early one morning in Fountain Hills, walking around the fountain and such. We decided to look for breakfast near us.  We heard great reviews about Flapjacks so we gave it a try but were severely disappointed.  Service was awful. We waited 45 minutes to get a table for 2. Then we had to wait 45 minutes for our food.  The famous pancake came out raw on the inside.  When we asked to move to another table because we were freezing by the door we got a condescending response of \"we have a strict no moving policy, where you sit is set in stone.\"  The only explanation I can think of is they serve the retired community and believe they can get away with being disrespectful of people's needs and time.  Truly ruined an otherwise wonderful day.  Should have gone to Chompie's."}
{"text":"Really, more like a 2 1/2 star rating. Hard to find. At the end of the  rear portion of a strip mall. Clean but not fancy or even pleasantly decorated inside. Bordered on dingy. We came Sunday morning about 8:30. They open at 7:30. As you arrive, you are supposed to put your name on a list outside. There is no sign explaining this to you. You find out after you come in and stand around for a while and then decide to seat yourself. Apparently that is verboten because only then does someone greet you and tell you the protocol. So you wait for your table even though there seem to be plenty of open ones. We got called in about 10 min. Not too bad. Then we wait for a waitress. After a while someone asks if you want coffee. That person tho, is NOT your waiter. The menu is basic, but ok. Omelettes, eggs, etc. They specialize in pancakes, esp. Dutch babies which look good. We ordered and then waited some more. The bottleneck appears to be the kitchen. The wait staff is earnest and friendly. When we finally got our food after about 30 min plus, it was nothing to write home about. Just ok. Our take, don't bother. There are LOTS better breakfast places in Fountain Hills Scottsdale."}
{"text":"First visit, a Tuesday morning, 9:45. Moderately busy. Seated quickly. Friendly wait staff. Black bug at bottom of water glass. Nice server said probably coffee grounds, but it had legs. Fresh water served promptly. Ordered two omelettes with toast, potatoes. Both omelettes tasty, but not hot. One served warm, one less than warm. Manhattan omelette with bacon contained only a few small specks of bacon; spinach and Jarlsberg cheese good. Greek omelette ingredients fine. Cold potatoes overcooked, shriveled, rubbery, inedible. Received rye toast instead of sourdough. Eventually received correct toast at end of meal, it was hottest food item. Pricey for the quality. We went there due to rave reviews, maybe just an off day, but I did notice other less than stellar reviews as well."}
{"text":"Today I am having a banana nut German pancakes with bacon and the service is good Definitely will be back to this place"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The service is great (once you have been seated) and the food is great! Their baked pancakes are definitely worth the 20+ minute wait! We know where we are going the next time were in the area!"}
{"text":"The Manhattan omelette was superb. They lost a star for having neither an espresso machine to make lattes nor having wi-fi. Both suggest to me they want me in and out. As a solo diner, in fact, that's how I felt. New to town, I'm looking for another breakfast place this morning."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Az. Have been to Flapjacks 5 times in the last three weeks and on weekdays and Saturday and Sunday. Each time, the food arrived hot - the toast too. Tried the Veggie Omelette with their homemade salsa and it was absolutely heavenly. Love their potatoes. Got their Apple Pancake which was extraordinary. Coffee was fresh, hot & great and I have to complement Kathy who has that constant smile, great energy; definitely spunky, fun and really took care of us. The other wait staff were I believe Rachel and Rachel who were also good and would refill our coffee cups as they walked by. There can be a wait on Saturday mornings but Kathy was on top of the sign up list and the diners were flowing in and out. Solo diners have the option to sit at the counter and enjoy the newspapers. Love this place. This is my go to breakfast place .  No more \" Hopping\" as I have definitely been in \"Dennyal\"."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and tried Flapjacks today for the first time.  We were very disappointed in the food and the slow service.  We also could not believe their \"no move table\" policy (that is not posted).  A group of 3 older persons came in and sat at the only table open, which was by the front door.  The waitress brought them water and a menu, but they had not even ordered their beverages yet.  In the meantime, two other tables opened up and they politely asked if they could move since it was so cold by the front door.  BTW, no one else was waiting for a table.  The waitress told them they have a \"no moving table\" policy.  One gentleman asked politely to see the manager - so another waitress (who must also be the manager) came to the table and repeated the same line with no apologies.  They said politely, \"I guess you do not want our business.\"  The group of 3 then left - and I do not blame them.  We also will not be going back, as Flapjacks is obviously not concerned about good customer relations."}
{"text":"A wonderful neighborhood family owned  restaurant where the breakfasts and the service are both outstanding.  This is probably the best breakfast within 20 miles! And if it's not Summer and you want to get in on a Sunday morning, I suggest you get there early!!"}
{"text":"Since moving here I've been here a few times ordering either a Greek, Napa, or California omelette and splitting either the French toast, Belgian waffles or the apple pecan baked pancake and the all you can drink pot of coffee. Every meal has been fresh, hot, filling and served with a huge smile from my favorite waitress Rachel. Food and service is very consistent and the place is always pretty crowded as the locals swarm to this place for Sat and Sun brunch.

If you're in the area try it as it's a cute little place to have breakfast at. If you want to beat the rush, get there early like before 9:00 AM so you're not having to wait outside on the small outside dining area."}
{"text":"Fun breakfast place with a nice menu.  Nothing fancy, but everything's good!"}
{"text":"Flapjacks is a great family restaurant for breakfast with a laid back quiet type environment. They have various specialty pancakes which require a little bit of extra time and love before they make it to your table. If you get there during busy times then you will have to wait for table to be cleared before you can be seated."}
{"text":"Rachel was so great! Best server ever. She was so attentive to us and our one year old son. The food was just what we needed after visiting the fountain one morning. Don't be a fool. Get the scrambled eggs (I didn't know you could have amazing scrambled eggs!) and pork sausage! So good!"}
{"text":"I was shocked to see the two star rating.  I recently moved here after living in San Francisco, CA and Liberty Lake Wa.  I actually make an effort to try pancakes anywhere and everywhere I can.  I had been on an uneventful search in The Scottsdale area, and yes I tried Butter's, then voila! Flapjacks! Up until now the best pancakes I had ever had was at a hole in a concrete tilt up on the Napa river in California.  It took me ten years to find that place.  Flapjacks has the best original pancake.  The extra expense for the Vermont maple syrup is well worth it!"}
{"text":"If you have a hunger for pancakes, go to this place.   The best.  Only complaint is coffee is just okay.  Wait staff energetic and fun."}
{"text":"Food is great! Servers and cooks are \"part time\" comedians! Had me dyin with the jokes that were flyin across the place. Nice chill scene!"}
{"text":"Whoever said this is just \"a slow version of Denny's\" is being ridiculous. This is a really comfortable, family-owned and operated cafe' with amazing pancakes. They have regular pancakes, but also these amazing German-style pancakes which are, as someone described elsewhere, a cross between a crepe, a buttermilk pancake and a souffle. They fill them with all kinds of things - you choose - like cranberry/orange or apple or pecan. I got the apple and it was kind of like an apple cake but more souffle-ish. No syrup necessary, but the syrup they do have is the real thing, not the corn syrup crap. We went on a Sunday morning around 11am and did not have to wait a minute for a table. The owners served coffee and made sure everyone was happy. If I lived in the Phoenix area, this would be a go-to spot for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast /brunch place. Not fancy at all but clean with fun service. I had lemon pecan pancakes with Manhattan omelet. My friend had the basic buttermilk pancakes with eggs & bacon. They are famous for the baked pancakes but we went mainstream this time.
It's a small place with friendly efficient service. Efficiency did not negate the great personality of our server."}
{"text":"Overpriced average food.  The staff is bossy and somewhat rude. The two eggs were inconsistent.  One was over easy and the other one was over hard.  Also the hash browns were cold."}
{"text":"We used to go to the breakfast place years ago and decided to go there today for Mother's Day. Three of us set off and arrived to find a reasonable group standing and waiting. We were fifth on a list with one group of nine ahead of us. We waited out from for the call to breakfast and suffered through milling around with other waiting including the group of 9 which consisted of 4 children under the age of five who were yelling and screaming and running around the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. 

We finally were office an outside table after waiting about 15 minutes and it took another 5-10 mins for the server to clear and clean off the table so we could sit down. Ordered coffee and reviewed the menu so that we could order when the coffee arrived given some tighter constraints. My wife ordered an apple pancake knowing it would take 20 mins but having plenty of time...we thought. As the time went by we could not hail a server (since we were outside) and I went to check on the now 30 min wait. Having been informed that it would be a while still my
Wife went to attend to other things and my son and I had our omelets. Unfortunately the  Rosemary potatoes were cold and my sons pancakes came out late. We took the apple pancake to go only to find out when we got home that it had nuts all over it (not ordered that way) and went right into the trash. 

As we neared the end of our meal outside we were surrounded by the cacophony of those waiting to eat as well as the pleasures of a young six year old throwing up several times off the sidewalk ten feet away (thanks to his mom and dad for the entertainment and crying of a child who was clearly sick but was still dragged here to brighten our day. 

Overall the service was average, food was below average and ambiance, well you get the picture. Doubt I will give them another chance to ruin a breakfast."}
{"text":"Great place, had the oven baked Apple pancake, girlfriend had the orange-cranberry pancake, both were really good, service was great, all the employees were smiling and friendly. Would definitely recommend. I will add that we got there around 8:30 and for a table right away, but it did start to get busy around 9, so you may want to show up early."}
{"text":"Flapjacks is a small restaurant in Fountain Hills. Small is really the key term. Our group of 8 waited for nearly 45-minutes for breakfast on a Saturday. Even with attentive/quick service, the restaurant was not large enough to accommodate their demand. 

Once inside, the decor was very basic. Really a no frills restaurant in the middle of a shopping center.

Nearly every member of our group ordered a California omelet. It was good, but not great. I choose to have pancakes on the side which were again good but not great. The pancakes flavor seemed a bit lacking, and the texture was not as tender as others I have had. By no means was the restaurant bad, it just was not great. 

If in Fountain Hills and not wanting to drive to Scottsdale for breakfast, I would recommend Flapjacks. However, if willing to drive, I would recommend other locations."}
{"text":"The only thing better than the food was the service. Very clean restaurant with extremely friendly staff. If your in from out of town like I was & not sure where to have your breakfast look no further this is your place. Already looking forward to tomorrow's breakfast visit. Extremely satisfied, defiantly would recommend."}
{"text":"Staying at the Casino in the middle of freaking nowhere? Yeah, me too. Don't have breakfast there, ask the super awesome people at the front desk for directions to this place.

What to order? Blueberry Almond Croissant French Toast with Maple Syrup... holy desert amazingness... and yes splurge for the maple syrup.  The owners were so cool and super involved in their business which I love. Since I told them I would be back the next morning, they saved my unused maple syrup just for me so I wouldn't have to buy another one the next day!

What's with the Flapjacks? Personally I think they're just really good pancakes. Where I come from Flapjacks are more like crepes but as far as pancakes go, pretty yummy.

What about eggs and stuff? The omelette I tried was good as it should be, but I wished I had ordered another french toast dish since that was so great. Eggs are good but I recommend sweet over savory here.

Other randomness...

1. They open at 7:30am. So if you're an early riser go kill some time first.

2. Order from the special menu. They are called specials for a good reason. They're special :-)

3. Coffee is yummy and they have real cream and Sugar in the Raw which I appreciate.

4. It's about 15 min. drive from the Casino here and its worth it. Especially since Casino breakfast is lame and waaaay overpriced."}
{"text":"Sterile environment with only a few knickknacks from Pier 1 Imports.  Food was average and portions were very small!  Price for two with a 20% tip was $26.  The wait was 40 minutes on a Sunday.  I'll eat Lucky Charms at home next time vs. Flap-Jack-Me-Off's."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of going to Flapjacks on Sunday during the Great Fair in Fountain Hills.  Wait was at least 4 times longer than we were told, tables were not cleaned promptly, customers sitting at tables just chatting while others waited to be seated.  Once we finally got seated it took forever for the waitress to take our order and even longer to get the food.  Omelets we underdone, trouble getting additional coffee, very little veggies in the veggie omelet, etc.  Just not a good experience and none of us would return.  They are not geared to serve a lot of people."}
{"text":"Excellent food! 
Ask for Rachel for your server, she is  
AWESOME!!!!!
Go here for breakfast or lunch. You won't be sorry"}
{"text":"The food here is very good, but overpriced.
We were told to sign in on a wait list, which I found redundant, because there were several empty tables available.  After a half hour, we were finally seated, and ordered our food, but never had our coffee, and water refilled.  The coffee is 2.25- at that price I better get a refill or two!  They need to hire more people, the servers seemed very rushed.  At least get some extra person to bus the tables."}
{"text":"We had one of the worst experiences in our long history of dining out this morning at flapjacks. My son was in town visiting us for a day from Los Angeles and we decided to take him out for breakfast. We were treated rudely, we were served the incorrect food, and when we ask to speak to the owner manager in order to register our dissatisfaction, she said that she was too busy to come out to talk to us and instead sent a waitress out to see what was bothering us. This was my second experience at Flapjacks, both of them were horrendous, and we will never eat there again and we highly recommend that you choose a different place for breakfast."}
{"text":"We found this gem in the rough via Yelp. We had the specialty baked pancakes. As they say on the menu, be prepared to wait - they take at least 20 minutes. If you have the time, you'll be rewarded.  Their iced chai latte tea is also excellent."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food at a reasonable price!  Sausage links are the best... also tasty baked pancakes!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place. It is fairly small with minimal decor and it doesnt do fancy but the presentation is more than plain. They change several menu items often and have the usual fare of eggs, pancakes, biscuits and gravey plus the breakfast meats. I really like the pecan crusted french toast which is served with fresh strawberries and bananas. The service staff is very friendly and engaging.
Lunch items are great too but go early as they are only open till 2 PM and dont serve it at all on Sunday."}
{"text":"Good customer service. The food was good. Just an odd atmosphere. Did not feel like a restaurant."}
{"text":"The baked pancakes are probably the best breakfast you may find in the Phoenix metro area."}
{"text":"Went to Arizona for a wedding(2 couples who rarely agree) and stayed in Fountain Hills. We all agreed baked pancakes were the best we ever ate......worth the 15/20 miniute wait to prepare.Service was wonderful. Ate there twice and wished I could have more.When back in Arizona I will get up early and tavel far to have breakfast here again."}
{"text":"Oh my god, the pancakes! 
I had the nutty German baked pancake. I don't think I will ever get anything that great in my mouth again. The service was on point, very friendly and have a sense of humor. The woman leading the kitchen greets those who walk in when she has a chance to breath over the hot stove. This I found pretty cool. I will definitely be returning and may even make the hour drive to the location for breakfast sooner than expected."}
{"text":"Beware of the hype.  If people are being honest, this place is a slow service version of Denny's.  My wife and I and my 17 month old baby drove out to Fountain Hills specifically to try this place and had to wait 45 minutes just to get our food.  It wasn't that busy, so something must have happened to one of our dishes or the order was forgotten.  When our food finally came, I thought we had been \"Punked\".  Very mediocre and over priced, but my primary disappointment is the lack of regard for my 17 month old daughter going nuts sitting in her high chair with nothing to eat.

I am tired of restaurants that don't understand the limitation of patience with young children.  I shouldn't be punished by a cranky baby, because a restaurant can't keep their act together.

Shame on you Flapjacks!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast places we've ever eaten at. Unbelievable pancakes and omelets. Found the place and ate there two mornings in a row. Would have gone back for lunch too but we weren't in the area. It's not fancy but for goodness sake go for the food."}
{"text":"The food here was prepared fresh & arrived quickly.  Our server was very friendly and accommodating to my son's little eccentricities. I found it a little strange that the lunch items were not available on Sunday, though they offered to bend the rules since they weren't very busy.  I found the menu, overall, to be a little limited - I'd like to have had a few more choices.  But if you're ok with just breakfast staples and great pancakes, then this is your kind of place.

We were looking for a quick breakfast with a smile before our long drive back to SoCal, and that's what we got!"}
{"text":"Oven baked pancake is a must try here!

I've been wanting to try here but they seemed to have a long wait anytime I came on weekend but finally they just happened to have a table available one weekend without any wait.

Rachael was our server and her exceptional service with friendliest smile made my experience here as five star. She even suggest how to best eat the left over at home. 

I had banana nut oven baked pancake and they were cooked so well, I didn't need butter or syrup. I would like to try apple one next time per suggestion from Rachel. Omelet sounded good too.

Happy to see a small family owned restaurant is doing well here. Glad to support them."}
{"text":"Overpriced for mediocre food
Recently placed an order to go and was sticker shocked
3 blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup $10.48
Nice profit margin for them but when feel ripped off you don't get repeat customer's"}
{"text":"OMG-This is my new favorite place for breakfast!  But I'm bummed it's in Arizona and I can only come here once a year when I'm in town for Spring Training. 

I had the turkey, brie, baby spinach & cranberry grilled cheese on 9-grain (yes, for breakfast).  It came with a shot glass of their tomato basil soup.  Wish I had more of that little gem. The sandwich was perfectly grilled; cheese was nice & melty but not so much that it dripped out. 

He had the blueberry nut croissant french toast.  It came with almonds but as he doesn't like almonds, the waitress suggested pecans and he was a very happy camper.  

Owner/chef cleaned the table & came out to chat later, coffee was perfect, wait staff was perfect, food was unbelievable.  Wish I could eat here every day."}
{"text":"So to start off this review would be no stars, but unfortunately I have to give at least one. The food is so boring and bland. I ordered a scramble and it looked like an omelet that was ran over by a semi truck there was no ingredients in it. You know the food is bad when I'd rather drink the Arizona tap water. I'm shocked that people eat here. Way over price for the amount of food and quality you don't get."}
{"text":"Excellent flapjacks...oven baked pancakes are outstanding.  People are so nice. A must when in fountain hills."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here several months ago and recall that is was very good. this time we stopped in for lunch. Turkey club, advertised as fresh sliced turkey breast and it is, so much better than tasteless sliced deli turkey. Spotless, friendly service. A limited lunch menu, good sized breakfast menu including some unusual specialties. Clearly they are concentrating on what they do best. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Just tried the breakfast spot. Was excellent! 

Small locally owned place...great service and food.

We shared a German pancake - will get this EVERY time we come....so good. I got the cheese omelette with Brie, Swiss and 2 other cheeses. Wonderful!  Will be back."}
{"text":"Came here based on yelp reviews. While the food was good the service was subpar. We signed in because that's what the sign on the window stated, but no server or host person to seat us. One server finally told us we don't need to sign in because it wasn't busy and we can sit wherever. Menu is small, but I prefer that to 4 page menus.

Our server barely paid us any attention. Took too long to get our food. She forgot the pure maple syrup I asked for and for $2.50 for a small bottle I wanted it for my pancakes. Bf had to get up to ask her for it because she didn't come by after dropping off our food. We finished our food and sat there talking for a bit before she even came by to clear plates and drop our bill. Service is why I'm only giving it 3 stars and why I wouldn't drive 40min again to eat here."}
{"text":"Apple Pancake was amazing. No syrup necessary. Biscuits & Gravy excellent, but served with green onions on top. Fruit was fresh, cold and yummy.  Canyon Omellette was tasty. 

Hours are 7:30 am to 1:00 pm ish. 

Price was reasonable. 

Wait staff was super friendly, but super busy.  Be patient and you will be rewarded!"}
{"text":"A tiny breakfast spot at the end of a small strip center near the famous fountain in Fountain Hills Arizona.

We arrived early (around 8, they open at 7:30) and there was a short wait (under 5 minutes).

Tip: just sign your name on the clip board located outside to get on the wait list.

We were excited to see the expansive choices and were immediately drawn to the baked German pancakes (allow 20 min). It ended up being a bit longer but it was well worth the wait.  I got mine with pecans and my wife got her's plain. They arrived crispy and delicious.  Definitely something different and something I'd get again.

The other thing that makes this place special is the bright and cheerful staff. They greet all warmly and deliver cheery efficient service.

Lots of regulars here which is also a good sign.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"I liked it but hubby thinks it's overpriced.  Food was very good, I had a veggie  omelette, nice and hot and chock full of veggies.  Service was excellent.  Nice little spot for breakfast.  Pancakes were light and fluffy, so they're true to the name.  If I can talk him into going back with me, we'll go again, some of those fancy pancake dishes look like they are worth trying out."}
{"text":"Came in today to grab breakfast after running a half marathon. 
As luck would have it, my youngest son was being difficult and in a mood. Thank God Rachel was our server. 
Let me start off and say the place was slammed due to the after half marathon crowd. 
My son refused to answer any questions but Rachel goofed with him and teased him to finally get him to respond with what he wanted. Once again, she was slammed but took time to get him to change his attitude. 
The food was amazing. I cannot speak more highly of the Pecan Waffles. 
But more importantly, I hope the owners realize what a gem they have in Rachel. 
I trail run the McDowell Mountains and I can promise you this will be my Saturday/Sunday post run breakfast going forward and I won't accept a table unless Rachel is serving us. 
Thank you personally to Rachel for taking the time to change the attitude of a grumpy 10 year old. It meant more to his parents than you probably are aware of"}
{"text":"Fabulous little spot.  Hubby had banana and nutella stuffed French toast and two perfectly cooked over easy eggs,  I'm not into sweet stuff for breakfast, but he loved it.  Me...I had the Manhattan omelet ....one of the best omelets I have ever had.  Not a big pancake fan, but the ones with my omelet were wonderful.  We're looking forward to enjoying more items on their menu before heading back to the rainy, but beautiful, northwest.  Service outstanding.  Definitely go to Flapjacks!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try flapjacks three weeks ago. We now have then at least once a week. From their oven baked pancakes, to their jarlsberg and avocado grilled cheese. Their breakfast/brunch is fabulous. Best we've had so far in fountain hills."}
{"text":"Flapjacks is great and the prices are super reasonable! I highly recommend the Napa Omelette, but like their name suggests, the pancakes are also fantastic. 

If you go on a Saturday or Sunday morning, be prepared to wait a little bit, but it was worth it. 

When we were there, there were only 2 waitresses working and also functioning as hostesses. This place is obviously very popular so may be time to invest in a couple more servers! Other than that, very good experience!"}
{"text":"Got there about 10:30 on a Saturday morning, maybe we were too late, don't know but the service was very, very slow.  They were busy, but I don't find that an excuse for slow service.  The food was OK, nothing specatular.  I would go back but try a little earlier next time just to see if the service is any better."}
{"text":"Came out to fountain hills as a staycation with my boyfriend & after looking at Yelp options for breakfast, this had the most positive reviews. And OMG I was in heaven. I got the oven baked pancakes, and yes this was my first time trying one! I got the apple one & I didn't need syrup or butter. It was pure perfection. The service was out of this world! My coffee was never empty, she was constantly topping it off, clearing plates, and asking if we needed anything else. The service was unbelievably amazing! Hard work and constant smiles made the atmosphere worth visiting again!"}
{"text":"We were in the area visiting friends and they took us here. We even came back again by ourselves it was soo good. We had their baked apple pancakes. Nothing like them !  YUM!!  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Can't be beat. Best food and service anywhere. No pics because we came right after our 5k and it was so good we scarfed it. The service was the most attentive and spot on you can get at any restaurant anywhere."}
{"text":"There was a wait the one (and only) time we visited this place.  I had the audacity apparently to ask the hostess/waitress how long the wait would be since there was no where to sit while customers waited.  Received a flippant answer.  We promptly left and will never return.  Had also received a coupon for the owner's new sister restaurant, Laura's Place, which we had planned to try at some point.  Promptly threw the coupon in the garbage as well.  No desire now to try either restaurant."}
{"text":"The service was mediocre at best, it wasn't too terribly busy and yet our server only came around a few times throughout our entire visit. I had my young son with me and granted he is a handful, but the server was not shy about making her dislike known about him. We waited a very long time for our food, we did order their famous baked pancakes which do take about 20 minutes, however we were never given the option to have the rest of our order brought out sooner. When the food did come out, the pancakes of course were piping hot, but the rest of the food, the eggs, ham, the potatoes were cold.  The potatoes are not tasty, I was not a fan of the eggs either. Although the pancake was delicious. Not somewhere I would go back to or particularly recommend."}
{"text":"OK little breakfast place.  Potatoes were excellent, everything else just ok.  Moderately busy and staff not that fast or organized."}
{"text":"Owner and cook really trying here, but presentation is completely off, roast beef \"special\" was dry, sauces are parochial, and manager did the post-meal plate-scrape on our table, right in front of us.

Did I mention that the presentation is completely off? Just look at the pics. Ugh. Haven't seen it this bad since 7th Avenue \"soul food\" fried-till-they-bounce de-presented plate presentations.

BYOB with no corkage fee. nice.

# Stuffed chicken breasts were the usual sterroid- and hormone-induced gargantuonomous meat hunks which are sadly the norm these days. Boring.
# \"Root vegetables\" were these sad little dried plantain-things

Little better than amateur home-made.

With the closure of the best french bakery in metro phoenix, Is there *any* proper restaurant in this part of town?

Sorry, Flapjacks. Stick to breakfast?"}
{"text":"This place is super clean.  Staff is super fun ... they will treat you like you're the neighbor that has lived next door for years. And most importantly the food is simple and DELICIOUS. Good home cooking"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here with a friend on a Sunday morning. The first words out of his mouth when we sat down was that his mother loved the Oven Baked Apple  Pancake. I didn't think anything of it until a waitress walked by with one shortly after we ordered.
     My response? \"That's a Pancake?\". Because it sure didn't look like your normal flapjack. It looked more like a souffle that had fallen slightly with apple and almonds on top with a little syrupy glaze. 
     I immediately regretted my choice, The Chorizo Scrambler. Which by the way was delicious. As were the 2 normal flapjacks that came with it. So soft and tender. They soaked up the syrup and melted in my mouth.
     All in all it was a wonderful meal.
     I would rate this a five if my scrambler portion was a little bigger for the money or it had another flapjack. My friend and I left a little hungry for spending what we did. Next time I'll get something extra.
     If you want a great meal, I'd say come here and love the food."}
{"text":"You can tell this is a very we'll run restaurant. Food is amazing, everyone is cheerful and friendly. It's worth the drive . Clean bathrooms!!!! I always bring my out of town company here."}
{"text":"Before we went to fountain hills, we looked online for a place to eat breakfast.  Flapjacks looked interesting so we went there.  I ordered the apple,nut, german pancake , and it was wonderful. My husband had the blueberry french toast and he really enjoyed it.  The waitress was friendly and even drew a map for us so we could find the casino nearby. When your traveling it's always nice to find a place you would want to come back to, and we definitely will."}
{"text":"We eat here every Sunday and just realized I haven't yelped about it. Awesome food. Great staff. A FH must!"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff and Laura, (the 
New owner) knows what she is doing!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating here's. The Olmert was very fluffy and rye toast was fine, but potatoes were mushy inside and weird gray toasty on The out side.  The service staff was very attentive, but the real downer here was the cook who was denigrating towards the waitresses.   She was apparently the boss as well, which just made it worse.  Never reprimand staff in front of others, much less in front of customers.

Easy here if it's most convenient, but I wouldn't go of way for it.   

The pancakes and German oven baked pancakes looked awesome.

But, the experience was mixed with the rudeness from manager to staff outstanding in the experience."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp!We got breakfast to go! First time eating here.  The food is heaven. I am a breakfast snob. I dunno what they do with their toast or where it comes from but it taste like it's delivered straight from heaven. The omelette was amazing to, not runny perfect egg, fillings and cheese amount. The side of breakfast potatoes were what I image crack is like just leaving you needing more to live your best life. If you want a tasty breakfast that will leave you talking about it to your coworkers for days, for all the right reasons. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Great for a no frills breakfast. Service is fine and the food is fresh and well cooked. Wished they had a more diverse menu, if you are looking for breakfast other than pancakes your options are limited."}
{"text":"Just a 15 minute drive down Shea Blvd. from the 101 in scenic Fountain Hills, this place is quite a find.   If you want fantastic food, hands-on owners who seem to love what they do and really care about their customers, then you have found a great place to head to.

Flapjacks is a small strip mall \"hometown\" place (Bashas' Plaza -  on the corner of the strip closest to La Montana).  

Two of us misunderstood that lunch hours during the week are to 2pm only during the winter.  We showed up a little after 1pm which was the current close time.  The owner graciously said we technically are closed, but don't worry we'd love to have you stay.  She told us the 2pm hours would be officially starting back very soon.  Genuinely nice and didn't rush us in the least.

Everything is delicious.  The German pancakes are huge and light and fluffy - leaving you happily filled but not with that overstuffed needing a coma nap feel after regular pancakes.   The apple walnut ones are my favorite so far.  And syrup is nice, but really not needed on these.

Specials on the board are always worth a try.  The Goat Cheese and Fig Grilled Cheese at lunch is surprisingly delicious and not too sweet.  Homemade soups are fantastic as is the coffee.

Saturday mornings can be a bit packed so be prepared for a little wait in a line out the door on a really busy day - but the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I always get the same thing, scrambled eggs, hashbrowns and chocolate chip pancakes. The best in the area as far as food and service!"}
{"text":"The staff was great, friendly, and attentive. Food was good reminder of Sunday family breakfasts."}
{"text":"Our meal was absolutely incredible at Flapjacks. I read online that we should be prepared to wait in line on a Saturday morning. We didn't need to. Had no problem getting a table for 8. The restaurant is located in a strip mall and is not that impressive to the eye. It's very clean and simple on the inside. They didn't have the blinds open at all, so I took the liberty of opening them slightly to let some natural light in. What the restaurant lacked in ambiance, they made up for in food and service. 
There was a list of specials on a chalk board that included a quiche of the day, a coconut pineapple oven baked pancake, pigs in a blanket, and blueberry almond croissant french toast (there were more but those are all I can remember off the top of my head). Everybody gave rave reviews on their dishes. According to the party the Pigs in a Blanket were awesome. The sausage was well cooked and seasoned, and the pancakes were light and not too sweet. The blueberry almond croissant french toast, which sounded like it would be sickly sweet, was well balanced and delicious. The palisades omelet was great, and the toast and potatoes were average and what you would expect them to be. The blueberry pancakes were \"delightful.\" 
My husband got the apple nut oven baked pancake. It came out fully puffed up and deflated as it got to the table. It was delicious (I stole more than a few bites), the apples were the perfect consistency and it was sweet enough that it didn't need syrup, but not so sweet that it was difficult to eat the whole thing. He also ordered a side of sausage, he said it was cold in the middle, and the waitress quickly brought it back to the kitchen and gave him a piping hot order. 

I ordered the greek omelet, made with egg whites. It was cooked to absolute perfection. It was perfectly stuffed and seasoned. I got the side of pancakes. They were light and fluffy. I put a little bit of butter on them and it was the perfect meal!


It was my Father in Law's Birthday and I offhandedly mentioned it to the waitress, when he was asking for raisins to be thrown into his old fashion oven pancake, not only did they throw in the raisins, but they also put a candle in his butter and sang to him. It was a very nice touch. The service was awesome. Two waitresses were constantly refilling coffee cups, water glasses, etc. It was noted several times that the coffee was great at our table as well. I had the Earl Grey tea. They served it already steeped in a teapot and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all they should pay us to eat here. We ordered the scrambles and I couldn't put enough salsa or salt & pepper to make them flavorful. With early reviews I was completely shocked that the food was so bland. Pancakes are nothing special either...plain  old buttermilk pancakes. Would not recommend this place.   I would have driven an extra half hour to Butters to have a complete experience and my taste buds to be happy."}
{"text":"Large portions and really good flapjacks. I will be going back. It gets really busy and crowed during the weekend."}
{"text":"First time here for breakfast this morning, able to walk in and sit down. Service was very attentive and friendly, ordered the Manhattan omelette and blueberry pancakes..Awesome! Would definitely make this my go to breakfast place! Hours are 7:30a to 1p would recommend coming early to walk in and get a table otherwise you might be waiting."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast, esp their German pancakes but a special treat is their Friday night dinners.  Always a selection of four entrees changed every week and wonderful service by owner, Laura and her capable and efficient staff.  Also two salad  and two dessert selections. Reasonably priced.  Bring your own favorite wine and only a $5 corkage fee.  Wife, I and guests have been their approx 5 times over last two months and will return while wintering in Fountain Hills, Az. Definitely a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST breakfast place in Fountain Hills! Location is very convenient, the food was very filling. Portions were very large and the staff are very friendly. We had an impatient little one with us, but our waitress was very understanding and joked around with us. Made me want to become a regular and a member of the lovely Flapjacks community . The baked pancakes were to die for and the Napa Omelette was well cooked and delicious, so glad we could find it through Yelp! We will definitely be returning. My only complaint would be that the food takes a while to come out."}
{"text":"I love this place! A small little family owned, pancake restaurant. Always great service and the German pancakes are worth the wait. Great atmosphere and the wait staff is great. The prices are moderate and most portion sizes are great. Just Great!"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere and service. Very friendly and great breakfast. I would surely come again. !!"}
{"text":"Whenever I travel I use Yelp to find a great place to eat and this place lives up to its reviews. I got the German pancake. It was amazing. So flavorful and they are right, it doesn't need any extra butter or syrup. If your looking for a small town feel kind of breakfast joint this is it. Can't wait to go again on my next visit to AZ."}
{"text":"very friendly staff and awesome puffed-up pancakes... what more could you wish for? we've been coming here for several years and have never been disappointed! the pancakes are oven-baked, crispy and puffy around the edges and soft inside, filled with delicious apple slices and a cinnamon-sugar glaze. yummy !! and the bacon is cooked beautifully, crispy and a bit smokey.
When we go with our dogs and sit outside they always bring a bowl of water for them"}
{"text":"We ordered two of the scramblers which took at least 35 minutes. They brought one out after waiting forever and said they had to remake the other one because it got stuck to the pan. I had added avocado to mine but there was just one small slice and it was brown. Ten to fifteen minutes later the rest of our order arrived. The food was not good at all.  They were not apologetic at all for our wait.  We will not return."}
{"text":"Flapjacks has the freshest breakfast and awesome service.  There is nothing bad on the menu. Great value!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a higher rating. I've been to flapjacks a few times now. 

My impression is this: for a no frills, simple \"taste of home\" breakfast stop, Flapjacks falls short in both pricing and presentation.

The prices are placed far too high for this places environment. The staff gives off a \"welcome home, come on in\" vibe-- as we step Into a simple, white walled environment. The food is GOOD breakfast food-- but why is this breakfast priced like a dinner at the Roaring Fork? The relationship between the pricing and the atmosphere/food is incoherent. 

It's not completely unworthy of attention-- but there are some major flaws to address before Flapjacks can achieve the success of an expertly constructed business."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast food joint. Fantastic German baked pancakes, but you must try the flapjacks (buttermilk pancakes). Croissant french toast is delectable, but you can't go wrong with the challah french toast either!

Great service and super accommodating!"}
{"text":"I love this place...I use to come all the time but now I work too much and don't get a chance to stop in but man is this place amazing....the rosemary potatoes are killer omelet selections are to die for and the specials are amazing...and did I mention that HUGE pancake thing they make well worth the wait and share it!!! :)"}
{"text":"First of all, I have to say that the staff has always been wonderful when we have been here.  This fall we were in for breakfast on my son's birthday and they made it very special for him.  The food has been great every time also.  
The only negatives are that on a few occasions the food has taken an exceedingly long time, and I wouldn't really say this was a brunch place because they close at 1 pm.  Unfortunately we like to eat out after church on Sunday but often times we don't get out until after 1 pm.  Wish they could stay open a little later on Sunday."}
{"text":"Walked into a nice little establishment here, people are very friendly and service is prompt. Gina our server recommended the omelettes, but i decided to get the german baked pancake instead. It was amazing good! A little pricey at 10 dollars for a cake, then I had to get some bacon cause it doesn't come with anything.... Oh well. Solid food, good service. No real complaints, I will come back if I'm in the area. I really enjoyed the baked german pancake"}
{"text":"Went to Flapjacks recently for breakfast and can say for certain we made the wrong choice. Food was very lackluster to say the least. Bacon underdone and cold, pancakes are not becoming of the restaurant namesake, omelettes were super basic, scramble wasn't really a scramble. To add to the disappointment, we had to ask for butter for the pancakes, jam for the toast, more creamer for coffee. Basic stuff that should be brought out right away. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. pictures are of the unfinished food. (And we were hungry!)"}
{"text":"Yummy German pancakes! A definite must-have. Unfortunately, they don't make their eggs and everything else as well as they do their pancakes. Gets really busy...especially on the weekends. Be prepared to wait 30 minutes or more for a table."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place for breakfast...a little pricy but good food & different food.  Anything they have on their menu is usually pretty good.  It is quite popular for a small place in Fountain Hills.  I do like eating there.  Awesome breakfasts."}
{"text":"I have passed by Flapjacks a bunch of times since moving here from San Diego but had never tried it until a few weeks ago. We have only been here for breakfast but the food is really good and the service outstanding.

Pancakes- light, fluffy, eggy pancakes. They are like crack, and are some of the best I have had at any restaurant. The nut pancakes are to die for too.

Omlettes- I prefer the manhattan with spinach, bacon, and jarlsberg. Light and fluffy eggs, plenty of bacon, but skimpy on the cheese. 

Dutch baby pancake- very good and very similar tot The Original Pancake House or home made. Haven't tried the specialty varieties but I hear they are good.

Coffee - better than most breakfast restaurants.

Service - outstanding. Very friendly, down home service. They are there to fill your coffee cup every few minutes or so."}
{"text":"We stopped by Flapjacks on our way up To Sedona after reading the Yelp reviews... the are right... this is a great place! We got there on a Sunday morning just after 8am and were seated right away, by the time we finished our meal there was quite a line waiting to be seating so I think we timed that one just perfect!

My husband had the baked apple pancake and the waitress was right, it was perfect without any syrup or butter added to it. I had the Greek Omlet which was tasty. My daughter (7 years old) had the special waffle - with crumbled oreos and chocolate sauce... she was in HEAVEN. I think that was her favorite meal of our entire AZ vacation!

Our waitress was super friendly, we will be back for sure next time we are in the area!"}
