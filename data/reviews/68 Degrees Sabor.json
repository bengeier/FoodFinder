{"text":"Food is great, but service is NO BUENO. They need to get friendly workers, the ladies there now are rude and mad. Especially the short big lady. We went in there again tonight and had to walk out. The big girl was in the back, came to the front right passed us, looked at us and turned away????  We weren't even acknowledged, Not a \"Buenas noches\"!! VERY BAD SERVICE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Raspados are delicious but service is wack.ladies in there are always mad and give really bad service.  It Would Be GREAT If SERVICE Was better."}
{"text":"AMAZING raspados! Workers may not speak English but what a perfect opportunity to practice your Spanish. Best guava raspado I've had in the past 8 yrs. The diablito is top notch! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I've ever been in.  Service is terrible, no English, took 45 min to make a Cuban, (which was so disgusting) and a shake and we were the only customers in the place.  Table was filthy,  I finally threw it all out and went to subway."}
