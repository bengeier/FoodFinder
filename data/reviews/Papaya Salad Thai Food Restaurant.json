{"text":"Incredibly fresh ingredients and very flavorful.  Had the summer rolls and Red curry with pork.  Both were excellent!"}
{"text":"Started with Crab Rangoon which is one of my faves but it was too sweet for my liking.  The shell was really good and crispy.   We ordered Siamese Chow Mein and Pad Thai.  Both were good but I ordered a 3 heat level on the Pad Thai and it was way too hot for me. Good service and nice clean restaurant. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Love the food here and service is kind. Last visit I ordered the massaman curry with shrimp - spicy level 8 - and it was delicious! Sweet potatoes are one of my favorite ingredients in the dish. Looking forward to trying other selections on the menu. Might step it up a notch and go with spicy level 9!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we tried this place. Very good selection. I had the Siamese Chow Mein with shrimp. Plenty of shrimp and the vegetables were nicely cooked but still firm with a tasty sauce.  Others in our party ordered spicy dishes. You get to order your level of spicy from one to ten.  We are so glad to have a Thai restaurant so close. We will be back."}
{"text":"We usually have to go to a place in Akron if we want Thai food. Not anymore. We ordered takeout of Pad Thai, Basil Rice w/ chicken, Drunken Noodles, and Crab Rangoon. If I had one criticism it was that the crab Rangoon didn't have much crab in it but everything else was excellent. Be careful when ordering your spicy level too. We ordered 3/10 and it was about at our limit. Most places we order 5/10 but we wanted to be careful since it was the first time we ordered here and we're glad we did. No more trips to Akron for Thai food!"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff and delicious food. Pad se ew with beef and Thai spring rolls. More than enough for two people. Excited to have a Thai restaurant so close."}
{"text":"Sooooo gooood love the papaya salad with pork.just perfect very clean and great service"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Friday night. There were only two other tables which is unfortunate since the food here is really good.  The waitstaff was attentive without being pushy. They were helpful with the menu (how spicy, ingredients, etc.) and knowledgeable about how the food was prepared.   I will definitely come back here and recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"So good! Our 1st time here & we'll be back! Spice level was perfect!  Red curry & Siamese chow mein!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Great service.  Very clean and fast.  Papaya salad was amazing.  We will definitely be back.  If there is one complaint it's that they served the food too quickly.  Appetizer then salad then entree all built up at the table spaced out only by a few minutes."}
{"text":"I think I found the diamond in the rough, the food was exceptional! I had the pineapple rice and it was flavorful and delicious. The crab rangoon was a very flavorful and creamy hands down the best in the area. I would recommend this place to anyone and I will be going back!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new place to try that served dumplings. I did my research and read the reviews before coming here. All seemed well. Well, I walked in on a Saturday night and there was only one other table there. Not a good sign. I ordered the steamed and fried dumplings and they did not look like dumplings at all. The stuffing was coming out of the top and the filling tasted like it had some sort of bread crumbs in it. The dumplings were bland and not flavorful. I ordered the drunken noodles and again, not much taste. The noodles were greasy and meat was very fatty. The ambiance was very quiet and there wasn't any music playing. The only pro is that the staff was very friendly. I am disappointed and definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"I adore Thai food, so I really wanted to love this place but food was so so. I ordered yellow curry and crab Rangoon. The curry was  ok , had nice spice but very watery and not a ton of flavor. The crab Rangoon had almost no crab or onion. Disappointed. For the price it was definitely not worth it. Will stick to my usual Thai place"}
{"text":"Four of us all got something different and absolutely loved every dish. Some of the best pad thai I've ever had and I'm obsessed.. such a clean, pleasant atmosphere and kind, accommodating service. Oh, and the Thai iced tea is next effing level."}
{"text":"Good food nvservice here !medium range menu prices, could be better! We may try it again."}
{"text":"We are from Columbus, and we're in the area for a concert. We stopped in before the show to have dinner. I have to say, Papaya had Some of the best Thai (Asian) food We had ever had. We had Crab Rangoon as an appetizer. They were fresh tasting and not greasy at all. I had chicken pad Thai. It had great flavor, tasted fresh, and had the right amount of heat. Yum! My wife had a Lo Mein dish  and loved it. We finished with fried bananas and ice cream. Amazing!!! If we are back in the area, we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My second time ordering takeout here, and this is my new favorite asian cuisine nearby! I cant wait to explore their menu more! I would highly recommend spring rolls (they are the best Ive had in awhile), the drunken noodles, and the pad thai. The wonton soup is very good as well, the filling they use is tender and delicious and the broth is light and savory. The variety of vegetables in their entrees are a huge plus to me, their appetizers are all delicious, and the service was great. No complaints with this establishment!"}
{"text":"Yes! I started with Pad See Ew and Pad Thai carry out. Both were delicious. The Pad See Ew noodles were a tad dry but the dish was still very flavorful. If I recall, I think I ordered it a level 6 and Pad Thai a 5, which was perfect for my younger teen. Curry is my go to any time, any where and I wanted to see how noodle dishes were before trying curry. So, we went and dined in.  We were pleasantly greeted and seated. We ordered steamed dumplings which I didn't love, but my kids tore them up. We ordered two dishes to share between three of us: Red curry with chicken (level 5) and Drunken Noodles (level 6). I could've gone warmer but my youngest doesn't like things spicy. Level 6 is perfect. When I tasted the curry, I heard a drum roll in my head. It was an instant \"hell yes!\". I was blown away and I mean it when I say curry is my thing. The Drunken Noodles were off the hook, too. Both dishes were full of flavor, color, texture, and taste. Both were also ample sized and we had some leftovers.   Our service was very attentive with water service, to-go box, and bill. Restroom was clean, too.    I highly recommend the newest, best gem in Cuyahoga Falls."}
{"text":"Wow is this place a hidden gem! Really tasty dishes, very reasonable prices and very kind and courteous service. What's not to like?!  It would be great if the had a liquor license to allow beer and wine; maybe down the road? Give this restaurant a try!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. Attentive and kind service. Great food. Decor is nice and inviting. Portions are big. Bubble Tea is outstanding. I love the vegan and vegetarian options. I had the drunken noodles the first night. We returned the next night and I had the red curry. Both were amazing. My son had Pad Thai with pork both nights. He had to take home a box both nights because it was so much."}
{"text":"Food was quite tasty on our first visit, so we returned tonight. We were greeted upon our arrival, seated and given menus and water. That was the extent of it. Sat there for over 10 minutes and no one else even acknowledged our presence. There were about 5 other tables and only 2 had food already. After being completely ignored, we decided to leave and take our business elsewhere. 6:15 on a Friday and they can't even serve their customers."}
{"text":"Their summer rolls are amazing and pho is pretty good too. Total comfort food. I love how their crab Rangoon has a slight sweetness to them. Please check them out! The servers are very polite and attentive too."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant three times for takeout, we have never been disappointed. Everything is tasty and the portions are big. My absolute favorite is the curry, all of it. As far as appetizers go I am hooked on the fried dumplings!!  Pho is very good and drunken noodle is tasty! The chicken fried rice is very good too! I'm sure all of it is good but these are the dishes that we have tried.  The customer service is great. The young lady who has always helped me is very polite and sweet."}
{"text":"Wonton soup, Chow mein, panang curry, pho... All delicious. The vegatbles are so fresh and every dish full of favour. Fabulous place. Our second visit and excellent both times."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is always fresh and the service is always prompt and friendly. I personally love the dumplings and have tried all the curries. Never been disappointed. The soups are also really great as well. It's nice to have a little diversity in food selection in the area. I would definitely recommend the stop or if you don't have time order some take out."}
{"text":"Excellent. Got the pad thai dinner and crab rangoon appetizer. All was delicious. The location is around the corner in the plaza, so don't give up when looking. It's worth it. They don't serve alcohol but that never bothers me for a meal. Very nice staff also."}
{"text":"I found this place looking around for new places to try so this place rose to the top. New Asian restaurants always pique my interest. The location isn't the best for business I feel but it's easy to get to.  The plan was to come here and try the Pho but I was very hesitant because Thai Pho isn't really the Pho I'm used to. Since my buddies were going to order the Pho, I let them try it out and got the Papaya Salad with shrimp. They actually turned an order of papaya salad into a whole meal which was very exciting to me. It came with fried pork or chicken and sticky rice! I opted for the pork and the server actually gave me an option of Thai style papaya salad or Lao style. I chose the Thai style as I've had plenty of papaya salad made by Laotian's.   My portion was decent but the sticky rice was horrible as far as portion size went. It's enough to make a palm size ball and that's it. It was pretty disappointing but the salad itself and pork was awesome. It's a great combo and I wished they gave you more sticky rice.  My buddies told me the Pho wasn't anything t special but it looked the norm. I find myself thinking about the papaya salad still!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout on a Saturday afternoon! Very happy with our choices and especially happy that it isn't Chinese inspired Thai dishes.. too many of those in the Akron area!  We ordered Pad kee mao and Rangoon. Friendly staff, cute and clean place! Hoping this place makes it. Nothing in that corner seems to survive! Can't wait to come back and try other dishes and sushi."}
{"text":"There are really no good Thai or Asian restaurants in the Cuyahoga Falls area. But that's changed with Papaya Salad opening. We tried the steamed dumplings, shrimp pad thai, springs rolls, mango sticky rice. Great prices and portions as well. A+"}
{"text":"I never write a review but this place is my first review...The place look clean and the foods are so delicious. I love their papaya salad cuz it comes with the meats and sticky rice just like Thai traditional style."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the Crab Rangoon as an appetizer, which was very good and I could tell it was made fresh (unlike the kind you get from most delivery places). Both of our meals were great: Chicken Pad Thai and Chow Mein. We like our food spicy, but the level 6 was not enough so next time we'll go to an 8 or 9.  Overall, the service was excellent - very friendly and attentive. We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out last night and everything was very good! We had the Shrimp Pad Thai, steamed dumplings, spring rolls, and mango sticky rice. So excited to have this place near by. Can't wait to try more!"}
