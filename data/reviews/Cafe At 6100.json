{"text":"Cafe 6100 serves good, basic comfort food. Love the BLT and burger and I hear the Greek Chicken special is delicious (Tues. I believe, and it runs out quickly). Breakfast is basic but good, as is the vegetable plate, which has many options. The staff is friendly and efficient and the space is clean with a relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"2 things that are going to make a lot of people quit going:

1) Prices continue to get higher, close to the point of why eat there unless you are swamped at work and work in the building and need to eat @ ur desk?...you could go to better places with better food and pay what they are charging now..i could literally drive/walk a few hundred yds to Panera and get a better salad for the same $

2) Along with this they are taking a lot of their sandwichs and removing side dishs so you have to buy them ala carte..so with a patty or wrap, where u used to get fries, now for the same price on the sandwich if u want fries u shell out an extra $2.49...So a wrap that used t have a side for $5.25 now would be $7.75..again i could go multiple places area southpark and get better for the same price or less

Also the help they have their are confused to say the least...trying to place a to go order, pay for it and pick it up is a chinese fire drill..I've seen better organized cock fights than their counter

while i give them props for vastly improvong the food from the last owners, they are losing the reason most people eat there: convenience....theres only so much folks will pay for convenience when better is only a short walk/drive from our building"}
{"text":"Cute little intimate cafe inside office complex.  Not fancy but friendly service and good food.  Menu is easy . Soups sandwiches and even a breakfast menu offered till 10ish each morning.
The cafe has nice table options and even bar seating. 
There were a handful of folks eating when I came in and the place was due to close in 10 minutes. 
All In all it was nice and the food was good. 
Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"I hate to say but I think they are overcharging people. I work close by so I've gotten breakfast a few times for there. The first time I thought maybe my math was off. The second time maybe they made a mistake. After the third time it's intentional. It's never a large amount but they are overcharging nonetheless. Pay attention to your bill."}
{"text":"Decent for a quick small meal. Friendly staff. 
As others said, prices going up will likely kill off all but the most time sensitive visitors."}
{"text":"My wife and I have enjoyed this place for many years. A true family owned and run diner experience. 

Breakfast - Chicken biscuits are solid. They use real chicken which is tough to find in some diners. Not sure if they have a coffee meter on all their coffee cups, but right when you are down to your last sip, there is Dee to fill it right back up. 

Lunch - we usually go with the large greek salad with grilled or breaded chicken. Really can't go wrong with either. They even make their own croutons and salad dressing. If you are in a sandwich mood, go with the chicken salad sandwich. 

Only complaint I have is, my wife and I have been going here for 3 years now and they just got a TV this year. Now I can catch the news in the mornings and catch March Madness or Golf without having to leave the building. Very nice.."}
