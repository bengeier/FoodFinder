{"text":"The service was very good. It is clean, the tables and linens. The food is good. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"got take-out.  We sat at the bar waiting for our food everyone was so nice offering us water and bread but we could see how overwhelmed the staff was. They were scrambling and the restaurant at 830 pm, was less than half full. We waited 40 min for our food.  The bruschetta  was fantastic, the green salad was pretty basic for 9$ tasted bagged but OK. My boyfriends pizza was very good, great actually but my pasta :(.  I ordered a grilled vegetable pasta with tomato sauce. The entire thing seemed leftover and was completely tasteless. I could tell the way the sauce (max 1 table spoon for a mound of pasta shoved into a tiny container) had absorbed into the  hard greasy noodles and how mushy the grilled veggies were . Leftover pasta shouldn't be served at a restaurant and to add insult, I think instead of re-frying  it with tomato sauce to make it half descent again, they just heated it up. I wouldn't have hesitated to send it back if we ate there. I would say for 17 $ I could have made it at home,  but honestly don't know If I could make it so poorly. If not leftover probably the worst carrying out of a pasta dish I have ever tasted, someone seriously dropped the ball.   I have to say though I saw other people getting pasta and theirs looked amazing so maybe I just had bad luck here. May give it another try because there isn't much in our area."}
{"text":"We just dined here for the first time this weekend.  The manager & staff were incredibly accommodating with my children's allergies.  Food was delicious too!  We will be back for more of that fresh gnocchi."}
{"text":"Ok Bistro. Great Gelato. Heavy on the Olive oil. Somewhat expensive Pizza and Pasta dishes.  Good Service not great."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a colleague the other day. I had their namesake salad which was tasty but expensive. My colleagues had the eggplant parmesan which was incredible. The atmosphere was pleasant but the restaurant smelled like burnt pizza the entire time we were there. I'm not sure if that was intentional. I definitely want to return to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Second visit here was much better! We had a different server, who was great. Personable, attentive and funny.   Really solid food again. 4 of us went for lunch, dishes included a pizza, a panini, salmon entree and I had rigatoni with wild boar bolognese sauce. Rich and tasty pasta, cooked perfectly, but after a while it was a bit one-note on the salty tomato side. Still very good. Had to ask for bread, which should be a standard table staple in an Italian restaurant.  The lemon gelato was great but my three coworkers all had pistachio and said it tasted 'weird and grainy'.  Not La Paloma quality for sure.  Warning: three of us had pop, $3 for a glass that was half ice.  When one of our glasses was empty, the server asked her if she'd like a refill, which she accepted.  She got charged a total of $6. I would interpret 'refill' as free. Didn't like that at all.  Fountain pop is cheap.  That aside, a solid 4 stars and we'll definitely pop in for lunch now and then. The patio is a great thing in the nice weather."}
{"text":"I was here on a Friday evening. My first clue should have been the lack of patrons at 7:30 pm . We ordered caprese  salad and fritti fritti as appetizers.  The lemon for the fritti fritti was old and dried out. The squid and shrimp was barely fried and not crispy. The cheese for the caprese salad was also old and rubbery.  Next we had papardalle with bolognese sauce and pizza diavalo.  The sauce on the pizza as well as the sauce on the pasta could have come from a can of chef boyardi.   The entire evening was very disappointing. The bright light in the evening was the wine. It mellowed the terrible food.   Hopefully the kitchen will get an overhaul. Until then there are plenty of other restaurants in the area to visit."}
{"text":"The service is great, I was never in need of anything such as refills on water, offers for another drink etc. I have the calamari fritti fritti every time I go here and it's amazing and made quickly every time. The squidink pasta is amazing, although I would recommend getting it without squid ink it makes the pasta black which is unpleasant for the eyes. The nutella pizza is a must have at the end of every meal! delicious"}
{"text":"I went in for a late lunch, to determine whether or not this would be a good place to bring a large group.  Very glad I did the test run.  Inattentive service even though I was the only diner most of the time I was there, and arancini that were repulsive (maybe the fryer oil was going off?).  I also was nearly bathed in spicy oil from being given a container with a wobbly lid--not that the server would have noticed.  Bullet dodged!  I'll take my group of 9, and several hundred dollars worth of revenue, somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Just randomly walked in and we were pleasantly surprised. The place was half full which is great considering the area and time of day.  The servers were very friendly and took our order quickly. I had the kale salad and added chicken to it for $4 and my husband had the veal sandwich which came with a salad. We shared the mushroom risotto balls which were phenomenal.   The chicken I had was amazing and grilled really well.  I tried some of the veal sandwich and it was very tasty too!  The beer was cheap but the food itself is in the mid range. Most dishes are about $9-$15 and for salads you can add chicken for $4. Totally worth it.  There are quite a few pizzas available and we'll definitely try those next time.   There's a nice little patio outside so when it's warm out again next year we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I only tried the hot table. If I could give 3.5 stars instead of 3 or 4, I would. I like the pasta here and the people are friendly. They also do sandwiches and pizza, I think. The pasta is good, kind of on the oily side, though, but the best of the bunch in the Lawrence/Dufferin area.  Lady York's pasta is usually too bland (costs the least), the lady at Bologna Pastificio is so rude I'll never go back (on the expensive side for a microwave meal--even if it's made fresh on the premises), Camarra's will make you broke if you go a lot, so this place is the go-to if you're craving pasta and you didn't make your own lunch."}
{"text":"Very bad people. I have been working there only for 2 weekends and it was my worst working experience ever! they are nice only with customers because they mean \"money\" but being a nice person is more than that. I worked there for S.Valentine and they didn't pay me my tips! and they payed me less hours too...why? only because it was my first working night, but I worked as everyone else and it was a very crowded night, do you know how many tips you can do for S.Valentine? a lot and they didn't give me even a dollar of MY tips....it was not fair at all.The kitchen is not well organised, customers can wait a lot before being served and many complained about the fish, the meat and the cheese for being not fresh."}
{"text":"Better tomato sauce than most Italian Restaurants I've been to in Toronto. A little bit too much garlic in their chicken panini but other than that, great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Finally got around to checking this place out tonite, and it's right across the road from the landmark \"Camarra's\" Italian restauraunt, another local haunt which makes pretty decent food.  We ordered two dishes,  A pizza, made in the wood burning oven, and thin crust and chewy. And a pasta dish, with Italian sausage. Both dishes were excellent and served hot.  The waiter recommended a glass of the house red, and I must say, it went well with the meal.  Found them to be reasonably friendly, and eager to please.It's a nice space, and was not very busy for a Tuesday night. However,  there were a couple of groups in for the evening, and that kept the staff busy.  I must say, the fellow who was a Barista, made an excellent Americano! One of the best I have ever had. My dining companion had a cappucino, and she thought it was awesome too..   Will I go back? Certainly.   PS as for the comments regarding the \"high\" prices. I would disagree. They seem to be offering good quality, and I don't mind paying a bit more for that.  $62 for the two us, including tip. Not bad at all.  In a strip plaza, so parking is not an issue."}
{"text":"Didn't get bread when I was sat down but they did have olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette as decor.  :)  Otherwise... the food was great.  The prices were reasonable for the quality. I ordered the seafood dish.  The orange roughy (fish) was delicious, very tender.  The salmon was well seasoned.  The lobster was perfectly cooked (not chewy).  The shrimps were good but struggled a little with the shells.  Pretty much destroyed the shrimp.  The pear walnut salad was good.  Can't go wrong there.  The mushroom risotto was also delicious.  Well done, very rich, lots of mushrooms, very flavourful.  Tiramisu (in-house, i believe) and cafe macchiato topped it off.  Friendly service, clean and standard upscale decor.  Definitely will be coming back.  Don't forget the bread to go with your oil and balsamic vinegar..  :) Looking forward trying their gelato... next time.."}
{"text":"I enjoy their shrimp pasta. Their salmon pasta, on the other hand, hardly has any salmon in it. Their desserts are pretty tasty too! Especially their nutella moon with cheese. Yum!   So why not 4 or 5 stars? Because I value people keeping their word and communicating honestly when they can't. When I ordered through Just Eat, they told me that I will always get a discount if I ordered directly from them. So I started ordering directly. The minimum order is/was $25 for delivery. Everything was fine until one day, out of the blue, they said I had to spend $35 minimum for delivery and that they would not give me the delivery discount because, for some reason, the food that I had been ordering from them which is still on their menu was suddenly not available for delivery. I heard a number of other excuses which didn't make any sense because I had just placed the very same order as recently as the day before and yet, they just wouldn't take that into account. Odd!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and glad that we did.  Phenomenal service and some of the best Italian food I've had in a while (coming from a guy with an Italian wife).    Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere and simple foods made really well. One of the best pizzas in Toronto"}
{"text":"I'm starting to find the Yelp crowd seriously critical. When things are good....good stars don't usually follow! Love this place in every way....btw.."}
