{"text":"Menu laissant à désirer tout comme le service. D'abord le potage au brocoli laisse un arrière goût désagréable en bouche.   L'entrée de chèvre chaud a été servie alors que le chèvre n'était pas chaud, au contraire, on sentait le froid du frigo.   Le plat principal j'ai pris le filet de porc. Aucune harmonie entre les saveurs. L'assiette est dressée de façon peu appétissante.  Considérant ce qui précède je n'ai pas voulu prendre (risquer de prendre) un dessert.  Je suis surpris que ce restaurant soit ouvert depuis aussi longtemps.   Je n'y retournerai pas. La majorité des 15 autres personnes de notre groupe sont du même avis.   Trop cher pour ce que c'était."}
{"text":"As a native Montrealer, this is one of my fav restaurants. This is saying a lot, since there are a ton of good restaurants in Montreal.  Food is terrific - while the menu doesn't change often, they always manage to do each dish slightly differently. The warm goat cheese salad is to die for, and the duck is always delicious. My boyfriend is obsessed with the smoked fish entree.  The service is also good - the head waiter now remembers us, and always makes a point to say hello. It is always packed in there, so sometimes the service can be a bit slow.  The fact that it is BYOB is perfect. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This is a BYOW restaurant, so that's always a plus. Saying that, I found the restaurant a bit over priced, the food is OK, don't give me wrong, but nothing special in my opinion. It is good if you want to try something new but I doubt it can become your favourite restaurant. No parking in the area, so you better go by metro or cab."}
{"text":"Nice little BYOB (Beer & Wine) restaurant in the bistro style. The chef obviously has a sweet tooth, everything was sweet, including the salad. Yes, even the salad was sweet."}
{"text":"Are you listening, LES INFIDELES satisfies with class and fervour!  Evan b. is right on with his BYOB details, a total win win. We also dined on the escargot, freakin' holy moly taste! I had the goat cheese brie crostini, never have I tasted such wonderful cheese than this summer in Montreal! MERCI! And the greens were dressed with, possibly, a champagne vinagrette?  A truly refreshing dish. A pork tenderloin in a balsamic reduction was heavenly and the cravettes were cooked to perfection.   We too walked through Parc Lafontaine and Rue Rachel is lovely. A great location for a pre- and post dinner stroll. The entire evening was a delightful date night. Make a reservation and see for yourself."}
{"text":"This is one of the best BYOW in the area. The food is always good and the service is friendly.   If you're familiar with O'Thym, this should give you a clue as to what you can expect."}
{"text":"This places does it right.  I spent 6 months in Montreal gorging myself like some fat Roman senator of old, and this is one places that stands out in my mind for a few reasons.  First, it's small and intimate, the kind of place that locals know and introduce each other to.   Secondly, the staff are friendly, efficient, and very knowledgeable. As odd as it may sound, they know their food.   Thirdly, they support fair trade, which isn't something I've seen in a restaurant before. It may be just the coffee or it may be more, but the fact remains that they seem to have a social consciousness about themselves.  And the food is simply delicious. I had the horse tenderloin and it was fantastic. The duck is also amazing.   While a little on the pricey side for the food, the cost is more than made up for on the BYOB side. Bring-your-own places should become more popular as it allows a greater focus on quality food.  Next time I'm in Montreal, I'm definitely going back to Les Infideles."}
{"text":"I only gave this two stars because the food was good. Other than that, there only negative things to say.  I will keep this short and sweet, I have never been to a restaurant with such poor service. It's actually quite embarrassing. There are way better restaurants with the same quality of food that offer a better experience."}
