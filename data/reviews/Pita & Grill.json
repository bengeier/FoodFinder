{"text":"I must say that i had big hopes for this place, but i was dissapointed .. this is my first time using yelp and i found this place through the yelp app hoping to get some mouth watering shawerma (( since there is so many good reviews on this place ))   But instead what i got was a 10 minutes wait for two sanwiches and even worst the food arrived cold.  Im not saying the place is bad but it needs some work and care because it has potential.  Hope you find my review useful."}
{"text":"Great business. Everything is fresh and delicious!!!  Fast service.  I recommend their beef shawarmas!!  We ordered family pack kebab mix, chicken shawarma dinner for the whole family and they were great and extremely filling."}
{"text":"Their shawarmas are delicious!!!  The best I've ever had!  I have daydreams about that garlic sauce.  Hahaha!"}
{"text":"Was introduced to this place from a catering event we had our work, we had chicken, beef and lamb shawarma trays from them. Really enjoyed their chicken shawarma. Went to the location, they had the traditional shawarmas and dinners on the menu.  I had their Shawarma Poutine, which sounded interesting, might try out their other dishes next time.  (by the way, there was not a table empty at lunch time, which is an excellent indicator of the food for me!)"}
{"text":"Best shawarma place in Sauga by far! The meat, especially the chicken, is seasoned to perfection. The portions and prices are fair as well. I am a long time loyal customer and always will be!"}
{"text":"It's simple.   This place has damn good shawarma.  I don't work around this location anymore, so I've tried to find another shawarma place to replace and even after trying more than 10 other places, haven't found one that matches it.  Honestly, I *wish* I could give them a bad review because I find the staff a bit rude, but the food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Excellent shwarma, I've had shwarma, in Montreal, Ottawa and so many other places, but this takes the cake. Their chicken as well as their beef are very good, and the quantities are quite big, i've thought about having two shwarma sandwiches since they're that good, but always always have been full after just having one. You can't go wrong, the prices are very suitable too. sheesh tawouk is amazing too."}
{"text":"My hubby and I stumbled upon this place quite by accident, when our initial choice of place was closed.  We basically took a chance, and glad that we did!  I got the chicken shwarma platter which had rice, salad and pita bread with it.  For what I paid (about $12), the portions were very generous.  My hubby got the wrap.  We were both really impressed with how tasty and delicious the food was, and glad we chose to stop here.  This place is definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"I've probably been to more than 20 shawarma/pita restaurants and I can easily say that this is by far the best one I've ever had. The cook knows how to prepare the food very well with the perfect balance of seasonings, spice and sauce. the portions are also very good and I will definitely be returning to Pita and Grill to get my shawarma fix and also would strongly recommend this restaurant to all food lovers. Great food and fair prices, can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. We love the Lamb Shawarma. Very pleasant staff. Clean and lots of comfortable seating. Across from Tim Hortons. Very reasonable price. I recommend this restaurant highly."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in the city hands down. I crave it at least once a week. The chicken shawarma plate is my favourite, but all the sandwiches i have tried beef and lamb are just as good. The garlic sauce is the best i have ever had. This is the best place to get shawarma."}
{"text":"While the food is average at best, the staff is what really turned me off about this place. Really poor service with little care about how you like your pita fixed."}
{"text":"the place is clean and nice. we liked our shawarmas - all ingredients seem to be fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"What makes or breaks these shawarma shops is their garlic sauce. This place has the sauce and they know it. They give you a limited amount and charge you for more."}
{"text":"Probably the best shawarma you're going to get in the Mississauga area, although that isn't saying much. The garlic sauce here is very good, better than most shawarma joints, but there's simply not enough served with a wrap and paying for more isn't worth it. I hate how stingy this place is when I'm paying $7.00 for a wrap of this size and I'm still hungry after consuming one. Simply not the best value around, but you can do a lot worse in this area.  It's fairly busy during lunch, so you should probably try coming here before or after the rush. While the beef and chicken shawarmas are more popular, you should really get the lamb."}
{"text":"Worst $8 lamb shawarma I have ever had, tough and no flavour, tap water was a large extra charge I forget how much, I refused to pay for that.  What a disappointment and this is no way to do business.  Ugh."}
{"text":"Beef could be better. ..Stick with chicken. Dinner plate full enough to satisfy most hungry ones out there!"}
{"text":"The first thing to note is the Eglinton Pita and Grill is NOT the same franchise as the pita and grill by Dundas/Confederation. This one's way better.   I had their chicken shawarma (2 for under $15 is a really good price considering the average price for a shawarma is $10).   Their shawarmas are, BY FAR, one of the most authentic, not to mention filling, shawarmas around. Their pack their pitas to the brim with chicken. A single bite from their shawarma will get you a mouthful of crispy seasoned chicken, savoury garlic sauce, a hit of fresh veggies, and a subtle kick of spice from the jalape√±os and hot sauce. They don't use lettuce, they use tabouli (which is how it should be). The pitas are grilled and keep their structure (they don't fall apart) and the aftertaste is a unique garlicky-chicken taste. No place has come close to the flavour profile of the Eglinton Pita and grill.   This place is definitely one worth checking out. For $15 for 2 shawarmas, they definitely don't short-change you here. You'll be full after one.  Im no shawarma connoisseur, but this place, by far, has the middle eastern shawarma experience down to a tee. Definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Tried falafel, it was not at all, maybe lb of cumin into each piece , whyyyyyyy !? It doesn't need that, just a little bit more than enough !"}
{"text":"We went there to eat with the kids.  We asked for hamburger and we were told that they just sold the last one. But 10 minutes later I was picking up the food and there was a hamburger on the grill but I did not want to argue.  The staff is rude slow hard to understand. The food is less than average tried the Shawerma and Falafel I am not impressed at all overpriced for the quality.  Never go there again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, and 10/10 would reccomend. I got a lamb shawarma and a chicken shawarma wrap I can say I loved it both were packed with a fat amount of meat, and the workers there hooked me up with making my wraps really thick! I loved it keep up the great work"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 1 star for their customer service. In fact the lady At cash told me that they don't need my business and not to return. My family and I have been coming regular customers of pita and grill for about 10 years. This location is a complete disappointment. I went in two weeks ago to get shawarmas for my staff. The lady at cash was miserable, it seemed like she hated her job. She doesn't speak to the customer buy flirts with her colleagues only speaks in her language. Making my sandwich was a difficult task for her, she had a problem with every topping I selected. Her colleague handed over my order, I informed him of her attitude and that I was a regular customer we have been coming here for years. The lady then told me that pita and grill doesn't need my business don't return. A complete shame. You will never have my business again. My family and I will go to the shawarma place across the street instead."}
{"text":"Super friendly service but the chicken shawarma was bland . Needs more flavour with authentic baked bread instead of store bought. Will probably not visit again ."}
{"text":"Excellent grilled chicken pita option for lunch near the convention center.  Quick and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Staff is very very rude. They try to rip off customers and cheat them out of their money. For example, I ordered a small fries, they charged me for a large. When I saw my receipt, I pointed it out to them and they didn't refund me the entire difference between the small and large fries. I let it go because I didn't want to argue over another 50 cents but it was the principle. Then the next time I went, they did the same to my friend but I pointed it out to her before she paid. They go \"oops sorry I'll change it\" and took the rest of her order. She was getting ready to pay but I stopped her as they hadn't changed it like they said.  Cheating their customers for that extra 1.50? So does not make sense. The shawarmas are amazing though."}
{"text":"Great wraps! I really enjoy the chicken shawarma wrap. The falafel is good too, nice and crispy! I come here at least once a week when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Although the food was okay, the staff could definitely use some customer service training. Heads up, they only take cash and Canadian Debit so we ended up paying in US dollars despite the exchange rate differences. Also, when we politely asked for another sauce we were told (quite rudely) that there was already one on the plate...well, we had two dinner meals (and two people) so we definitely needed a second sauce. The same thing happened with the silverware...I'm not sure how two people were supposed to share one set of silverware. Visiting from Dallas we always try to eat at local restaurants...unfortunately the energies in this particular eatery were not very welcoming."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always come here to eat or have take-out. It is the best!! Given the area that this restaurant is in, I did not have high expectations before my initial visit. I am always so happy to see how clean this restaurant is and how friendly the staff are. I have never had a negative experience here. :) I would definitely recommend the chicken shwarma dinner! Portions are also very large and we have definitely shared the chicken souvlaki dinner and the chicken shwarma dinner before. Food tastes fresh and the garlic sauce is on point! Mmmm!"}
{"text":"The good: shawarma wraps are big and fairly priced The bad: dinners are overpriced The place is clean. Cafeteria style format The garlic sauce, hummus and tzatziki kinda suck It's a local crowd. I wouldn't go if I didn't live nearby"}
{"text":"I love eating schwarma. I've tried a bunch of places up and down Newmarket and Aurora and this place is by far my favorite tasting one. Just opened yesterday so still working a couple quirks out but food wise. Totally yummy. May go back for seconds later tonight!"}
{"text":"I had a chicken Ceasar salad wrap.  The wrap was super greasy and the chicken didn't look like chicken. It also had a bone in it. I will never go back here again. I was very unimpressed. I am a visitor from the United States."}
{"text":"One of the best sharwarmas I've had in a while. It's a bit different from some of my other fav shawarmas in that it's not a combination of sauces that makes it very flavorful, but rather the spices and aroma infused in the meat. I chatted briefly with the cashier and she mentioned the owner has a secret recipe that he keeps from all the staff working there. A recipe worth keeping secret (usually) means food worth trying :) Oh and the quantity is decent, no one in our group left hungry. I'll be sure to stop by again next time I'm in the area, and hopefully follow up here with some photos."}
{"text":"Absolutely rubbish experience.   I stopped by for a falafel sandwich once which was priced at $4.50 pretty cheap considering the location.  The server asked me what I wanted on my sandwich and when i asked him for cucumbers (of which there was a stockpile sitting freshly cut IN THE TOPPING sections) he remarked that its not allowed? That the cucumbers are only reserved for salads.  I offered to pay more for cucumbers seeing as I was hungry and didnt really care about price at that point. He refused and made a fuss about it and gave me my money back.   So this dude would rather give you your money back than make a sale. What an idiot. This is how YOU DONT RUN a business folks!  Ill take my money to the subway restaurant right next to you."}
{"text":"For starters the portion sizes for everything at this place are fantastic! I end up having leftovers which makes me feel like i really get my moneys worth. The food is ALWAYS delicious weather you eat meat or you are a vegetarian there is something on the menu for everyone. If you're choosing to dine in it's a very clean and spacious place where you never feel in a rush to get out of"}
{"text":"We were in town for a conference and stayed across the street at the Delta Toronto. The woman at the register-Margaret- told me the total for a mixed grill platter and a falafel platter and 2 waters was $36 which seemed high. i knew the exchange rate for Canadian dollar told me my 40- US was more than 40 canadian, but she took my 40- US $ and told me they charge 10% for taking US $. I stood there wondering why she STILL gave me no change. Illegal i suspect. DO NOT EAT HERE! just checked the currency rate and 36 US=44 canadian!!! they took 40 US from us which is 48$ for a $36.07 bill."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma salad had bone fragments in it and the service was quite rude. This was my second  Visit and second bad experience, lesson learned :)"}
{"text":"Not bad Was however a little disappointed by the way they did my gyro wrap.  He guy slapped on 3 pieces of what looked like mystery meat on the grill and voila ! But the taste was there !"}
{"text":"Wow! These placed has changed for the better.  The Food was always the best. I have tried lamb, chicken and beef shawarma. The meat is spiced well and is tender to eat. The Pita bread is always fresh and the topping or ingredient what every you may call them are fresh. They also have jalapenos which I love to have in my shawarma. In my opinion this is the best shawarama joint in Mississauga, although lot of places have oped up in years but they still keep their bar up!  The service is fast, many people working and are friendly plus not cheap on sauces and topping.  The place has been revamped as they moved to a big, better place near by. Beautiful seating area appealing to family and friends. The place has be transformed into a sit in restaurant. The place gets really busy in weekdays around lunch time!  For my muslim folks - They serve halal meat!"}
{"text":"Big location with a fair bit of seating but a lot of wide open wasted space. The assembly line serving style works well for quickly moving the line. The pita is a good size and well stuffed. The flavour is very nice, but I always add the hot sauce as I eat to give it the kick it needs.  The beef and lamb were slightly dry.  The chicken was good. It's been a while since I've been here. In the past the line has been almost out the door; not so much this time. Granted, there is a lot of competition in the area for this type of food.  There are so many places in Mississauga, it will likely be a long time before I return."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 10+ years. They have the best souvlaki, sharwama, the most amazing  tzatiki I've ever had. The staff is incredibly kind and the service is amazing! It's a casual little place with excellent food. I always get the chicken souvlaki dinner with extra tzatiki of course. My only complaint is they won't give me the recipe lol!! But 5* hands down."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices. Owner is friendly and the environment is clean and quiet."}
{"text":"Amazing shawarma! Much better than Paramount and other popular places. The shawarma is PACKED WITH INGREDIENTS AND FLAVOR.  Their chicken is perfectly seasoned, fresh ingredients, and their garlic sauce is absolutely amazing!!! Recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre. Would not go to again. The service was good but the food was just flavourless.  I got the lamb sandwich and I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Great space, bright atmosphere, friendly staff, good food, and timely (I got back to work in time!)  Friendly staff and owner totally make this place go."}
{"text":"Thought I would try this new place. Turns out they have been here a couple of years. Tried the Rockin Shwarma - chicken which is just rice and chicken, no salad or vegetable side.  Quite a lot of food given.  I've had many shwarma and this one is different than my usual \"go to\". Which is Egyptian. Not sure where this restaurant is from. The hot sauce is nice and spicy;   Overall 7/10 for taste. More flavour on chicken would be great.  I would come back"}
{"text":"Good place with excellent customer service. Average tasting foods, reminds me of Pita Pit."}
{"text":"I have been to this place few times, and good know it stays open late on the weekend, I had tried their Lamb Shawarma, and chicken breast on a bun both very good   this place is decent, I would stop by if i am in the area  thanks for reading"}
{"text":"- i miss ottawa and montreal shawarma - this place is service-able if youre in the area - nothing special, but you would never imagine that the place has a dining area judging by the exterior."}
{"text":"Pita Grill produces the best shawarma plates I have ever had. Please note I am referring to the plate and not the sandwich, I have had just the shawarma and it's not the best I have ever had, but good.   The plate consists of beautifully moist yellow rice, a fresh salad, and either chicken, beef or lamb. Religiously I will order the chicken because it tastes so good, its seasoned perfectly and pan fried a bit before hitting the plate. That extra step to quickly fry it makes a huge difference.   In addition to the plate is their garlic sauce and hot sauce. Now these 2 condiments make a huge difference in the effectiveness of this plate. The garlic sauce gives it a sweet tang and cuts the food very well, the hot sauce is not really all that hot but fuses well with the garlic sauce and everything on the plate, even the salad!  Overall I have not had a better plate anywhere, I know of some places who have comparable meat, but the rice isn't as good, or the salad isn't as fresh and tasty. I also recommend slaming a bottle of mango juice from the fridge there, it's mad thick and so tasty and complimenting to the meal.   Enjoy."}
{"text":"Great addition to the harbourfront area. Good food and clean restaurant. Fast food with a dining area.  Best shawerma on the area."}
{"text":"Flavorless shawarma I'll go to Villa Medina instead. However nice ambiance."}
{"text":"1st 1 star review in a while...  Friend picked this place... I didn't check the reviews before coming otherwise I would've vetoed.  Ordered the lamb shawarma. It was terrible. One of the worst I've had.The \"lamb\" was the biggest letdown. It tasted nothing like lamb, or beef, or pork, or chicken, or any other meat that I've had. I'm not sure what it was. Also it was extremely dry and overcooked. No seasoning at all. They add a few veggies to the wrap but they are all mediocre and do not look fresh.   Avoid!"}
{"text":"Ordered a beef shawarma wrap. I ate 1/2 and threw the rest away. Couldn't chew the beef and the taste of whatever else was on there was horrid. They prey on tourists who don't know better. This one does now..."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, a casual place to eat. The food was alright. I had the Chicken  Souvlaki Dinner which was around $17 with a Nestea and tax. I didn't like the potato and rice that much. Chicken was really good and the salad and bread that came with it was what is expected and the portion wise, it was alot. Overall I thought it was okay, there were alot of breakfast and other options available, which I may try if I'm in the area and craving Mediterranean food"}
{"text":"The chicken is tender and just the right moisture level. The garlic sauce and toppings are much better than any other place out there. I can't describe how amazing these wraps taste so just go ahead and try one, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love their shawarma. Love their falafel. If I could stop only eating those two things I could try other things on the menu but those are so good I can't fathom not getting one of them when I come here. Super clean. Really friendly staff. Large portions and relatively inexpensive. Try here for sure."}
{"text":"This place is decent if you are looking for some Shawarma in the Yonge Street area. The portions are huge and you can share a dinner with a friend. The dinner was $15.   The service is always quick and efficient but I find the Shawarma not as flavourful as other places. Something is missing and I can't seem to point my finger on what it is. The dinner comes with Rice, Salad and Chicken and a pita - but they forgot my pita this time (no biggie, less carbs :))"}
{"text":"Only 3 stars for this location. Beef shawerma sandwich was very average. It almost looked like minced meet. I won't be ordering that again here. Might be back to try their chicken shawerma. Other locations I tried were better."}
{"text":"Pita & Grill is your standard shwarma fare.  I tried the chicken schwarma plate and it was pretty good, flavourful and moist. Large portions, though the rice wasn't that good. Salad was a standard greek salad.  Pita is just out of a bag.  The garlic sauce is pretty good, and I think the best in the area, though they don't give you enough and extra sauce is $0.50 per container.   It's about $10.50 after taxes for a chicken schwarma plate.  Beef is a bit more I think.   Schwarma sandwich is $6 or $7.  Comparing it to other schwarma places, I would say it's fairly standard. I used to work in the mid town area where schwarma places are abundant, and this would fit in there (though a bit pricier).   Larger portions than Paramount Foods, so this is one of the better choices in the area."}
{"text":"My experience today was the worst ever!!!! This restaurant's owner is responsible for taking customers orders, and unfortunately she doesn't know how to treat her customers in a proper way. With her arrogant attitude, she conveyed me a message of not returning back to her restaurant.    From my point of view,  restaurant owners should highly care for their customers' satisfaction.   An unhappy customer"}
{"text":"Its descent  food, don't get me wrong. Its just not something special for me. It is kinda bland and other places I get a better crisp on the pita. I have had worse though. But I've also had better."}
{"text":"Customer service is great but the bald short guy doesn't look very happy at all. Shawarma doesnt taste so great on a plate but somehow tastes amazing as a sandwich! Falafel here are perfect! If you are a falafel fan, come here! Pricing is moderate. Dining experience is great as restaurant is huge and clean! BTW i am referring to the Ellington/Dixie location, not too familiar with rest."}
{"text":"Amazing beef shwarma and decently clean.  Good price too.  Better than any shwarma I've had downtown.    Dinners do look overpriced though."}
{"text":"Walked in on a whim after an electronics surplus run and discovered EXACTLY how shawarma and souvlaki are supposed to taste. Worth the lunchtime wait, and I hate line-ups with a passion. If I lived there I'd be home by now. I have been jonesing for this place since I landed at YYZ... dreaming up an excuse to drive out to the wasteland where this incongruous deliciousness resides."}
{"text":"It's my favourite shawarma place in Mississauga. The chicken is the best because they make it on the shish unlike the lamb which they grill.   Very generous portion of meat, if you ask for anything you'll be served well. I believe the pickles is a bit salty, and the chicken is over cooked that became dry in some times.    My toppings for the chicken are garlic mayo, pickles, fries inside and over pressed. Their rice is amazing with aromatic spices. It's the best in town and different from other pita &  grill places."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great service... Staff is always friendly! Restaurant is clean and conveniently located. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the worst shawarmas I've ever had! No flavour at all! Meat tasted fine but the sauce was disgusting and ruined the whole experience!"}
{"text":"nothing at this restaurant tastes middle-eastern. the people working there aren't even middle-eastern to begin with. throwing bunch to shawarma sliced chicken on a plate with some yellow rice does not qualify you to label middle-eastern food.  food with huge quantity the boy gave me behind the counter. he was very friendly and seemed very generous.  food does not have any taste at all. like i said, its simply just some chicken thrown on rice. their tahini sauce, garlic sauce, and hummus do not have any taste whatsoever. on other hand the greek salad was good. but i did not go to eat salad.  this place is considered to be Halal as it states here but nowhere in the restaurant i saw any sign which proves authenticity."}
{"text":"Both I and my girlfriend got food poisoning. Luckily the shawarma we got was so soggy and disgusting that we only ate half."}
{"text":"Very quick service. The dinner plates look decent and yummy The fried pita bites are very very delicious"}
{"text":"Nothing great but good shawarma spot on the Sauga-Oakville border  tried the beef which a review I read raved about and while it was good, a lot of it was over charred seriously detracting from the enjoyment of my meal  I will give it one more try as I am in the area a lot so will provide an update then   Decent option if close and in the mood but dont seek it out."}
{"text":"This is the best chicken schwarma I've ever had. Such a large portion of delicious food and always very fast."}
{"text":"Complete and utter disappointment. I love Pita and Grill and have been to the Tomkin / Eglinton  and Dundas / 427 locations many many many times. When I saw this place open in NewMarket my heart sang and my tongue salivated. That's where it all ended.  Chicken was stale and had been placed in a hot plate. Chicken tasted like it had been made in morning and dried out. The lettuce was wilted.  This establishment is a complete disgrace to anyone serving up Shawarma's and should be fined from the Shawarma police!   Pass!"}
{"text":"Worst souvlaki dinner ever..!!!  I had order for a platter  to go. To start with, the salad was worst. Half of the lettuce was pink and tasted bad. The rice had no flavour and the garlic potatoes were missing.   But the souvlaki chicken was good though."}
{"text":"LATE NIGHT ALERT: PITA & GRILL IS OPEN TIL 3AM ON FRIDAYS AND SATURDAYS - in a city where late night food options are scarce, this is absolutely huge!  Ah, shawarma. One of my favourite quick foods. So easy to make, yet so hard to make well.   I visited Pita & Grill with my family and we were able to try a diverse array of their offerings. I had the lamb shawarma dinner, while others in my group had the mixed grill dinner and the chicken shawarma sandwich. The dinners come with salad, basmati rice, and a pita. The sandwich comes with all the typical fillings.   For a shawarma restaurant, I've found two areas that separate the bad from the good - the salad and the pita. Yes, the sides. Too many places skimp out on the salad, serving dry, uninspired combinations of lettuce and onions. Far too often have I received a reheated pita that I'd rather not eat.  Not here. The salad has fresh lettuce, tomato, and onions, topped with feta cheese and a tasty dressing. The pita (as far as I know) was freshly baked. Easy points, owners!  The mixed grill was a behemoth - a full takeout container with one kofta, 1/3 chicken shawarma, and 3 pieces of grilled chicken, topped over a layer of basmati rice. The lamb dinner was also plentiful, with a half takeout container filled with half lamb shawarma, half basmati rice. For only $2 more than the lamb shawarma dinner, the mixed grill is a fantastic option for satisfying even the most intense of hungers.   Pita & Grill is both takeout and dine-in friendly. They have ample seating. They are also good for groups.  I'd like to also point out that they have many more food options, including omelettes and other breakfasts.   Tip: Ask for the garlic sauce. Thank me later."}
{"text":"Came here today after the Argos game. It's conveniently located in between the Rogers Centre and the Air Canada Centre.  I had the Lamb Shawarma Wrap. The lamb meat was tough and did not taste fresh. The server did not leave the wrap in the grill long enough as one side of the wrap felt cold - almost frozen.   They also refused to serve tap water.  I've enjoyed the other Pita and Grill's I've visited in the past (Mississauga), but this one was an exception."}
{"text":"Good portion, tasty food, fast service, cheap prices! What else do you need??? The freaking shwarma that's what you need so go get one!"}
{"text":"After hearing much hype from an ally, I ate a chicken shawarma from this establishment.  The shawarma was gigantic and packed with meat.. one might say its density is comparable to a \"brick\".   It tasted like every shred of chicken was coated in seasoning; twas a flavor overload sensation. All the guys who work there look alike (think pokemon nurse joy or officer jenny situation).  I have no constructive criticisms other than, open one in Toronto and make the staff wear different colored shirts so i can tell them apart.  Oh, and beef up that name...\"Pita and Grill\" is so plain.  You might as well call it \"Food restaurant.\""}
{"text":"Really amazing shawarma - love the fact that they fill it up and it taste great - always enjoy eating here. The place is also very clean and tidy."}
{"text":"Beef schwarma was a tad dry, dunno why because the chicken is consistently moist, and whatever they season it with is awesome, and the wraps here are very reasonably priced. Thusly why I've had a few check ins here because I crave shwarmas at least twice a week and living in Newmarket, the options for things like these are slim unless you wanna leave town. So its worth a shot, in fact I'm ordering just after I write this and I'm gonna go for the falafel which a co worker told me was really good here. And I've never even had falafel in my life so this is my starting point I will have nothing to compare it to lol. Give this place a shot though because I don't think many people have and it sucks to see local businesses get kinda ignored. Do it up!"}
{"text":"This has got to be the best Shawarma I have had since coming back from Lebanon! Used to be better when it was just the 2 owners running it. Their new staff isn't as good and I find they don't grill the pita on the press long enough so the bread is a little cold. But just ask for them to grill it a little longer and you are golden! Enjoy! Oh and I recommend the Lamb! Mmmm"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite! Food is always freah and what i really like about this place is how clean it is..awesome chicken and lamb shawarma and their garlic sauce is one of the best i have ever had. ."}
{"text":"Another great find in the heart of mississauga... Had the lamb shawarma ...it was very tasty and priced reasonable ! Service was friendly and prompt !  Food quality was very good !  Location has good parking and right off eglinton"}
{"text":"On the outside pita and grill looks like a sketchy place to say the least. Looks however, can be deceiving. Pita and Grill is nicely decorated with a vast amount of seating for all patrons on the inside. Quite often there is a huge line but the employees move quickly and have you in and out in no time.  Today I ordered a chicken shawarma with fries and extra garlic sauce. The shawarma is fresh and delicious. They really slather on the garlic sauce and I absolutely love it (luckily my boyfriend had it to so garlic breath for both of us). The fries were crispy and hot !! I always order extra garlic sauce to dip my fries in with the ketchup on the table. The food is really well  priced in my opinion and everything is halal. With fries for both of us and 2 chicken shawarmas it came up to $20. The employees are also super friendly and helpful! I love this place and it is definitely somewhere you should try if you haven't before!"}
{"text":"Had a chicken Shawarma dinner plate and it was damn good. I would give 5 stars if it was a copule dollars cheaper. Chicken was done perfectly and garlic sauce was perfect as well. Definitely I'll try this place again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some of the best beef shawarma around I must say you need to try Pita and Grill! Especially this location. The reason why I mention beef is because decent chicken shawarma is all over the place but good beef shawarma is almost impossible to find. I must say chicken shawarma is good here to me as well but I come here when I'm craving beef. 5 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place so much and have been a loyal customer for over six years. Now that I don't live in Ontario anymore, I make it a point to get a shawarma wrap every time I visit and this place has never disappointed me. The chicken shawarma is always amazingly seasoned and is a flavour explosion. And that garlic sauce is absolutely amazing. Cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"I am sorry I didn't review this place before visiting. What a terrible chicken swarma. Salad selection poor, sauce tasteless, meet dry and strange tasting. Falafel very oily. Disgusting overall. Would never return"}
{"text":"Amazing place,  good prices,  clean,  tasty and good portion of food.   Staff is amazing and friendly,  I have been going there for a quite sometimes now,  and they always make the best food with a smile."}
{"text":"My numero uno shawarma joint people!! This place is the bomb dot com. They just do everything right... From their homemade pita's to their delicious fresh salads...you just can't go wrong. I can't get enough of their garlic sauce. Mind you it's extremely garlicky and you'll need a 1/2 a bottle of listerine after your meal but it's ohhhhh so worth it.   Their meat (chicken/lamb) is bursting with flavour and yummy spices....Not fatty or dry like other shawarma places. And their basmati rice is an upgrade from other places as well. It's spiced to perfection and fragrant. I can't get enough of this place. They also serve breakfast ... Shawarma + eggs anyone?? I sometimes wanna buy the garlic sauce and eat it with a spoon. It's THAT good! Don't judge.   Note: Some may think that this \"pita & grill\" is the same chain as the one at tomken and eglinton ... But it's not. They are both very good shawarma joints but this one on confederation is better in my opinion."}
{"text":"4.5 stars I come to this place at least once a month! After discovering it, this is in my top 3 favourite shawarma place! I like it more than osmows, lazeez, wrap a bite, pita nutso, 5 star shawarma, paramount... You get the picture, I take my shawarma's seriously.   The garlic sauce is out of this world! The salads are so fresh and the portion sizes are always more than enough. The shawarma plate and wraps are what I usually get. The baklava is also very yummy. Most of The ladies who work behind the counter are nice but there's always that one chick who looks like she hates her job... All in all the restaurant is top notch! Order extra garlic sauce on the side!!! It's a must! It's 50 cents per container (which kinda sucks) but it's so worth it.  Tip: weekday lunch hour = super busy long lines... Come early!"}
{"text":"I go here often for lunch at work. Sometimes I try to go somewhere else to eat, but always end up at Pita and Grill as if there is some magnetic force. Great value and I always buy some extra hummus and pitas to take home with me."}
{"text":"This place was introduced to me by co-workers and glad they did. This place is super busy during lunch hour and for a good reason.  This place is hidden along a plaza near Dixie and Eglinton. But yet have a large Pita and grill sign that can't be miss. It's super clean, spacious and lots of seating.  The pricing is surprisingly really good! For 10 bux you can get yourself grilled meat with rice and salad. Trust me when I say, they are not stingy with quantity. They also have amazing choices from shawarma to burgers to poutines. They are quite cheap and all delicious.  The only thing thing is they don't for their garlic sauce for free. It's 50 cents each...I say be nice and get more returning customers. Other than that this place is a gem and would definitely be back and advised others to go here as well.  Peace out, Davey"}
{"text":"NOTE: This review is only for the (so-called) beef shawarma at the CONFEDERATION PARKWAY location in Mississauga (February 1, 2015).   After having one the best shawarmas at Tarboosh a couple of weeks ago, my husband and I decided to pop and grab a couple more for dinner last night. Unfortunately, Tarboosh was closed so we decided to try Pita & Grill (given the excellent Yelp ratings).  We should have probably ran for the hills when we didn't see the shawarma on the spit but rather in the back being brought out on a tray.  Anyway, let me get straight to the point.  Pros: with the exception of them dissing Tarboosh, the service was relatively friendly.  It was clean and it had many menu options; hence the reason I'd likely try something else. Cons: the shawarma was actually pseudo shawarma. They used a teensy bit of pre-cooked, sliced steak or beef such as Steak-EZE¬Æ (see pic) and likely just microwaved it to make it warm - absolutely no taste.  The sauces that I guess were supposed to be tahini and/or garlic were actually some type of mayonnaise and there was very little turnip and pickles (which must have been marinated in tons of salt) and there was no hummus or hot sauce - it was bad.  It was something I could have made at home myself by purchasing the Steak-EZE¬Æ.  Mine would have been better because I would have bought the proper condiments from the Middle Eastern grocery.  I know I'm like the lone wolf here with the bad review but just read the \"Not Recommended Reviews\" as they are consistent with my review.  I honestly think that Yelpers are giving the shawarmas good ratings because they are mistaking it for Tarboosh or another Pita & Grill location because, as I mentioned, this was bad.  I'm by no means an authority but I've had a lot of shawarma over the years and this was right up there with the WORST.  Rating:  TWO STARS because it appeared to be clean and the service was pleasant."}
{"text":"Officially one of the best shawarma's I've ever head. Went in to try it out today with a friend of mine. Selected the chicken shawarma sandwich,, it was superb. Extremely flavourful and perfectly done. She told us to the garlic sauce under. I had mine extra spicy. The flavour, specific middle eastern spices were heavenly. Took a beef shawarma before leaving to have at home. It was again, better than anything I've tasted till date. Clean place, superb food, cheap. Gonna be a much visit anytime I'm there."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times to grab takeout. My fav plate is low carb chicken dinner. However, they always skimp out on veggies. All I get usually is literally half a cucumber, a sliver of a tomato and two slices of onion. The chicken is great though, hence the two stars. But I'd still like to have a variety of veggies or at least more. Maybe a few pickles too to enhance the plate. Is that too much to ask?"}
{"text":"I have only had the falaphal and chicken shwarma pita wraps here. I recommend the falaphal wrap it's  $5.37 tax included. Its a good lunch option considering so many places in the area are expensive.   That being said, the other items here aren't really a deal. The Pita and Grill garlic sauce has a nice zing and they put pickles in the wrap. I come here because it's close to my work."}
{"text":"I love this place, and it is one of my family's favorite Shawarma anywhere. These guys know how to make a fresh and tasty Shawarma, and the fact that they are always busy shows it for itself.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"By far the best chicken shawarmas. And the garlic sauce!!  been going there for years and the same guy has worked there the whole time. The quality and portions have not changed. Don't waste your money on other places. Under 7$ for a chicken shawarma. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My Favourite Shawarma Sandwich or Meal in GTA. They still have the most delicious shawarma. Whether one picks lamb, beef or chicken (my favourite of the three) Pita & grill has the best meat on the spits and makes the most delicious sandwich. The meat is moist, marinated and fresh. The pita bun is not chewy and their garlic sauce is tasty! I do enjoy their yogurt drink as well. Prices are still below $10, they have lots of space and the sandwiches are readied quickly. On the down side the sandwiches are becoming smaller and they are in Mississauga! Also, the fifty cents for extra garlic sauce is not so sweet (pun intended). Also, last I checked samosas were Indian so I am not sure why an Arabic fast food place sells them.. By the way their tabouleh salad is getting skimpier and skimpier and missing a lot of tomato and moisture. There is something to be said about a shawarma sandwich parlour which has managed to stay tasty for ten years."}
{"text":"Came here for some eats late the other night. The food was fresh tasting, served quickly and reasonably priced. Exactly what my wife and I were looking for. Thanks for the deliciousness!"}
{"text":"The big women with the tattoos , Samdoha or whatever her name was extremely rude and disrespectful toward the our family when we asked to change the garlic with katchup, just lost our family's business"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times.  Something new to try sharwma poutine.  Prices for wraps are reasonable their dinner platters are too expensive and don't get a lot of food portions.  1 thing missing on their menu.  No Chicken on the Rocks!!!! When asked about it they don't know what the heck it is.  Advice to restaurant know yourself and your competition.  The ppl that work there are pretty rude too.  Check it out sometime but not a go to place for me"}
{"text":"Used to work close by to this place.  Food and prices are on par with their competition.  They're are better then the franchise sharwma places pita pit, paramount etc.  Are they better than Osmows or Lazeezs not even close.  The customer service here is crap but the food over looks that.  The owner of the place is a cheapo that charges extra 50 cents for garlic sauce.  Cheap move for a business that's gets line ups during the lunch break on weekdays.  I would rather go to other places though for better service this place is just too shady. I no longer work close to this place and I don't find myself going back here for a craving so that's money saved for me"}
{"text":"Was there today trying to find options for a 8 people gathering. I didn't get much help as the people on the counter were not keen on providing information. I would rank this place low due to the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Pita & Grill - four locations in Mississauga, corner of Dundas Street West & Confederation Parkway specifically - 3/14/10  With vacation last week, and Bellyman starting his new job this week, Bellyman has fallen behind. But, Bellyman is back and has many new reviews for you! They are from the great city of Toronto, Bellyman's favorite place and dream city. (If anyone wants to sponsor Bellyman to move to TO, feel free to say so! Bellyman is talented and funny!) These reviews will be useful when you visit, and make sure you tell the folks that Bellyman sent you!  Toronto isn't a long drive for Belly Family, but it is long enough. After spending three hours in the car, Little Belly was getting cranky, so we decided to stop and eat. Belly Family has investigated living in the Mississauga in the past and drove through there to get into TO just to see the sites. Not sure where to eat, we pulled into the parking lot of the Pita & Grill as they had signs in the window advertising gyros, and Belly Family likes gyros!  Walking in, the place appeared to be clean and neat which is always a good sign. They had a large cafeteria-looking setup where you could choose the various toppings for the multitude of toppings available for your sandwich. After getting Little Belly situated, Mrs. Bellyman and Bellyman placed our orders. Each of us got gyros, but just one side of fries to share. Little Belly got a grilled cheese.  As you can see from the picture, the gyro was tightly wrapped and completely stuffed. From first bite, Bellyman was stoked at how good a sandwich it actually was. Bellyman has had many gyros in his time, and this one of the best he's ever had. That's saying a lot! The fries were cooked perfectly; not greasy, not too crunchy. Even Little Belly's grilled cheese was fantastic.  About the only things Bellyman did not like about he place was that drinks were limited to cans from a fridge, with a fountain not being available. Also, they didn't take credit cards, only debit cards and for some reason Bellyman's would not register properly. Bellyman understands that taking credit cards incurs charges. But, Bellyman also hates carrying cash. It's the 21st century. Figure it out.  But, those two things aren't enough to keep people away. Pita & Grill makes a wonderful sandwich and is well worth a visit as long as you pay cash. Next time Belly Family is in TO, which looks like it's going to be in May, we're going to stop in and try the shawarma, which appears to be a huge fad in TO right now. Bellyman always likes to try something at a place he likes first so he knows he's getting a good version, and Bellyman trusts Pita & Grill would do it up right!  Verdict: Bellyman heartily approves!"}
{"text":"I don't get why this place is so popular....food is below average...lots of better sharmawa places around. .plus the food is so salty...service is slow as well..."}
{"text":"This is a really good shawarma place. I didn't really have high expectations given the location but I was pleasantly surprised. I ate here many times and the food and service are pretty consistent.   I usually get the shawarma wrap or shawarma salad. I've never tried their beef or lamb dishes, so I can't comment on that.   One word of warning: their garlic sauce is deadly and you WILL \"remember\" it the next day."}
{"text":"First thought as I walked in the door, mid January is an odd time to still have the Christmas decorations up, not that I can say anything we still have our tree up, but that's a story for another time.  We were the only ones in here and all had the chicken shawarma dinner, I find out to be a safe bet when trying out a new place. There was a shawarma cooking, but hee pulled it out of a heating tray, I was immediately assumed the chicken would be dry, and it was slightly on the dry side, but the spices were nicely done, and not overpowering.  I wish the portion of chicken was bigger, the rice was plain and nothing special, and the salad could have used more dressing as well.  I don't know if there is any link to a location in Mississauga of the same name, but the Mississauga location is better by miles! I've had better, but I've had worse, but wouldn't come out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. The lady who takes your order seems genuinely annoyed by your mere presence. I'll never set foot in here again and suggest people avoid this place like the plague (Which I'm sure their rancid, over cooked, tasteless meat will soon spread)"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a number of times. It is close to my workplace. A colleague had told me about it over a year ago.   You get a lot of food when you order any dinner platter. I have yet to do that. When I do, I will ask that my order be takeout. You get a ton of food, including rice, salad, and a pita on top of whatever meat item you have decided to enjoy.   I love the chicken and beef shawarma wraps. They are a decent size and you can customize them with various toppings, including pickled turnips and hummus.   Yesterday, I tried the egg burger for the first time. I have never had a fried egg in a burger. I was surprised when I got my order that there were two beef patties. It also came with a ton of fries. I am dubbing this burger as the protein burger. It was so good. I'd order it again.   I'm not a huge fries eater. The batch today were saltier than I like. I generally like the fries because they are made with real potatoes. My manager came with me and a colleague. He asked if he could have the fries that I couldn't consume. He loved them!  It does get busy here. There is a ton of tables in this restaurant and have never had to wait for a free table.   The food is yummy and fresh. Try it out sometime if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Guys working here are super friendly. Great ambiance and fulfilling food. The quality of the food is great, do try the dinner plates, they are amazing."}
{"text":"I love lamb shawarma , so the moment I saw it on the menu I was sold. But the cook doesn't really know how to cook lamb, lamb was like a rubber:( I better travel to north york for 30 min and have a great shawarma over there..never again."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced good food. They have one of the best shawarma in Mississauga. Also very friendly staff, definitely something you seldom see at a middle Eastern place. They all so carry some Western options. The plaza it's located in is little shady in the night times."}
{"text":"Really happy with the quality and price of the good here!! Good toppings including tabouli :). Other major plus my shawarma wrap was wrapped up perfectly!! No drips or spills I actually got to eat the whole thing.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all costs. I came here today (family day) because everywhere else was closed. I was driving by and decided to stop by. The good is below average. For $13 dollars I got rice and chicken and small garden salad (pretty much iceberg lettuce). The owner was rude. I have been to tons of shawarma places but this place is the worst. I had to go back and ask for sauce. When he asked if I wanted tahini or garlic, I said both and he rolled his eyes. I also asked for jalape√±os. As if it was something extra. The pickled vegetables are always included in a shawarma dinner plate. For the price I paid, I wish I went to Bamiyan or anywhere else. Never coming here again. Don't waste your time or money.  And they charge $0.50 for Garlic sauce!! Can you believe that???"}
{"text":"So this is going to be a warning to never - and NEVER, under whichever circumstance you may find yourself in, step a foot inside Pita and Grill, as you will only surprise yourself with the sheer level of disappointment and dissatisfaction.   In fact, if I had the option to give 0 stars, I would have since even 1 star seems too exuberant. But the obligatory 1 star goes to how this shawarma made me question my miniscule and insignificant role in this universe of not being able to stop people from going here. In my 15 years of living in Toronto, this is by far the worst Shawarma I've ever had. And my love of humanity makes me want to protect my fellow Torontonians - which is why I am leaving this review, in hopes of deterring others from distress and trauma.   I ordered a chicken shawarma and a bottle of water which totalled to a bit more than 10 dollars. The shawarma was extremely salty and dry, with no other flavours to it. When I say salty, I mean I was worried about my health and it was unbearable. Take that $10 and go to the Subway next door. You'll thank me.  This place seemed pretty busy at the time of visit which confuses me but then I also walked in so naively, not having forseen the suffering I would have to endure."}
{"text":"Service was okay, but the food was horrible.. I went there for souvlaki, but there was none.. there was only Shawarma and Kofta.. So I tried their Kofta, and it was soooooo bad, and the rice seemed old and tasted weird, also when I asked for Ketchup, they were like \"We only give it to people who order fries\" WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.. I DIDN'T EVEN FINISH IT"}
{"text":"Nice guy at the counter but literally the worst falafel I've ever had. I couldn't even stab it with a fork it was so stale. And very overpriced. Over $10 for a falafel meal with drink."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in the city hands down. Generous on portions and service. I prefer the chicken over the lamb and beef shawarmas as I found it to be a compliment with the other ingredients. Ask for it to be placed under the grill longer for a nice crunch.   Plate dinners are HUGE. Served on a big plate as well as with pitas, it's quite possible to share it with another person.  Have yet to find something on the menu that is disappointing. Best part is that it's open until late night."}
{"text":"I thought it was ok. Not authentic. The hot sauce is just a watered down tobasco. No taste in their Tahini or garlic paste. I will say the portions are large and nicely priced. I ordered the Shwarma wrap but perhaps the other dishes are better. Service was really good.."}
{"text":"Place is always great! Ordered the chicken Sharma dinner. Only thing is the pita was served cold but the chicken made up for it."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and it was good.  Yesterday I went and ordered a chicken shawarma wrap.  Got home and started feeking sick.  The vomiting began around 8pm until 8am today.  Have had an upset stomach in the past but brushed it off.  Never going back.  Take your chances."}
{"text":"Though shawarma was flavorful the lamb pieces were really dry. Also as a customer I did not feel the staff was welcomimg enough. They were very matter of fact sort of. I read bery good reviews of this place , but sadly did not feel the vibe. Possibly I will stick to my personal favourite in Mississauga area(Safari)."}
{"text":"Great place for Shawarma!  My fave is the salad with any of the meats.  The staff is very friendly and food is always good!"}
