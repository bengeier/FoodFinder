{"text":"Oscar can cook. Everything we ate was terrific. No salt no pepper to be added. Empanadas, pork belly, steak you name it. And don't leave without tryouts Nguyen the best churro you will ever eat. Oscar aims to please and he surely did. I"}
{"text":"I tried the empanadas and they are absolutely amazing - best I have ever had! The service was wonderful as well, very welcoming and they know how to serve their customers!! Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. The food is finger licking good. We were greeted by the owner and chef. From the appetizers to the main coarse, full of flavor. I will definitely be here numerous times. Oh, the sangria and fresh fruit waters are bomb.com."}
{"text":"Excellent  service,delicious  food!very diverse and yummy!!!bandeja paisa was out of this world!!!come out and try it !then dance some salsa to burn off the calories !!! Sangria and paella are also part of this incredible menu at Aroma !congrats and thank you chef Oscar for the amazing  and delicious  food! will definitely  recommend AROMA !!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Not only were we treated to a superb meal and excellent service we went on Wednesday night and got a flamenco show.  Chef Oscar and his staff are the friendliest."}
{"text":"Simply put: I'll definitely be back again! When I go to a restaurant, what I look forward to the most is the food, followed by service, and ambiance, etc. Here, everything was great! The food is delicious. My wife is Colombian and the sancocho (traditional Colombian soup) and the empanadas, tastes exactly as my wife's grandma makes! Scrumptious! (If only my wife knew how to make it at home also... Ah dreams for one day ;)). The service was very attentive as well, with explanations and service as detailed as we were hoping for. The restaurant has different themed nights and when we were there it was flamenco night. The distinct clapping of the flamenco rhythm along with the Spanish guitar played live, hit you as soon as you stepped in through the front door, and the dancers, beautiful and strict with their movements, just as you would expect from this traditional dance. I look forward to seeing the other nights and getting some salsa classes they offer to improve my dancing too! Best of all (or at least of equal value) the price! I would say it was very fair. Especially considering it was a dinner with live entertainment. I went with my wife and her sister and for the three of us we spent less than $50 including tip! Oscar, the owner and chef, came to introduce himself to us at the end of our meal and to personally thank us for coming and ask how we liked everything. He answered some of our questions regarding gluten free menu and some other inquiries, and his hospitality was a pleasant addition to our overall evening. Thank you Oscar and team, we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"As soon as we got there the hostess sat us down and quickly brought us our drinks. I ordered the maracuya which is mad from passion fruit. And Wifey ordered the sangria. Let me tell you my aunty would make jugo de maracuya when I was a kid and it's been my favorite. I was surprised to find they make it fresh here!! So delicious! So anyway we ordered the lomo saltado and the paella valenciana and to start off the empanadas and bacon wrapped dates. What a treat our appetizers were amazing. I will warn you normally paella takes a while to make so order it as soon as you get there, if you know thats what your having (it's well worth the wait!) we used to go to Lima Limon for the lomo saltado put we will definitely be coming here instead! Also the best paella in town! My hats off to chef Oscar, well done sir."}
{"text":"The food and service far exceeds our expectations.  The owner Oscar is also the chef. Fantastic food and very reasonable prices. Very relaxing environment.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excelente sazón, todo estaba bien preparado, buenas porciones, delicioso, la paella, la bandeja paisa, la sangria, la cazuela, todo muy rico, hay que regresar pronto!!!"}
{"text":"I met a friend for salsa dancing at Aroma and we decided to get dinner. So glad we did! I had the Arepas from the tapas menu and then the bread pudding. The Arepas were so satisfying, the perfect combination of sweet and salty. They were luscious and soft with a perfect crispy exterior.   The bread pudding was some of the best I've had. It wasn't too sweet but was drenched in gooey, delicious sauce and was packed with pieces of crisp, fresh apple. You definitely need to try it.  Aroma is a little hard to spot since they don't have a permanent sign yet but it's worth looking for. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times, always early afternoon. Food is good and Oscar is very friendly. The problem all three times was the music! It is random Pandora type music playing. One song latin, one nice current pop song, but everytime I have been there rap songs come on often! These are explicit, unedited songs! They say f#ck, and $h!t, and N word repeatedly. I can understand this happening once and someone realizing this and correcting it, but when it has happened all three times it shows how oblivious they are to the ambience! I cannot eat at places, nor bring family to places, that play that kind of music and not even care! Why would you have rap music at this kind of restaurant anyway? Much less every single time I have been there! Because of this, I won't return!"}
{"text":"Chef Oscar Sanchez is the King of Paella! The Valencia is packed with saffron-seasoned rice, many mussels and chunks of chicken, imported chorizo, fragrant garlic shrimp, and a savory sauce. The giant skillet meant to feed two was more than enough for three of us to share and the 30 minute wait went quickly. Request it a bit more done if you enjoy the crispy socarrat bottom, and pair this with the amazing Spanish emapanadas packed with unctuous stewed beef. It's an incredible meal we won't soon forget.  HEADS UP: If you're even remotely interested in this divine dish, get your ass to Aroma ASAP- they're closing at the end of the month and returning to a catering-only business. Oscar's paella will still be available by special order for delivery to your home or event, but call in advance as he books up fast for holidays."}
{"text":"Had the lomo saltado which was amazing  The staff and the owner were super nice  They had live music and beer and wine Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Wife and I have been there twice on Thursday, which is salsa dance night. Between us we've had the Bandeja paisa, paella valenciana, empanadaa and the seafood plancha. All were very well prepared and plentiful, with the paella and Bandeja providing next day lunch. Although Bandeja was all very well done I would recommend small green salad to balance the large amount of tasty meats. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"New place my family is from Colombia and its great to see some dishes from our country on the menu. The food is awesome and the service excellent. I would recommend to anyone wanting to try a multi national food menu."}
{"text":"Brand new amazing restaurant by the world famous Oscar!!! Every dish has tons of flavor, Oscar is amazing. Any special requests, Oscar can do it!! Vegan? He's got that too!!! This place is sure to become one of your favorites!! My wife and I love it! Come check it out for yourself, you won't be disappointed !!!"}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh and delicious food! Very friendly service. Just like the name suggest Carlos is knowledgeable on authentic Colombian cuisine. Nice place to watch the futbol games. Also teaches salsa at the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Came here tonight for their Top Chefs Las Vegas event and the food was out of this world. Chef Oscar versus chef Lucky Thai. I could not decide. Everything was delicious. Oscar's Paella, which is always on the menu, is beyond delicious. Bonus, he has it vegetarian also. This is a must try restaurant. I will be back, many times."}
{"text":"Fantastic evening!  We were there Wednesday night to hear Ricardo Griego...superb as always!  Discovered much more, though!  The food is awesome...chicken enchiladas verde delicious, and the chorizo is the best we've ever had!  Couldn't resist the bread pudding and it didn't disappoint!  Along with the fabulous food and music, the service provided was outstanding.  Chef Oscar personally checked with us to make sure everything was to our liking.  Our waiter was attentive but discreet, never intrusive.  So glad we found this gem in Las Vegas!  We'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Great food . The  empanadas are delicious, the lomito salteado and bandeja paisa are as well."}
{"text":"Awesome place and personal attention from the owner himself... The difference events also, for dancing and good healthy fun... Come and have a good relaxing and worthy dinner"}
{"text":"While searching for Peruvian food nearby, Aroma came up so we wanted to give it a try. It was quiet and near closing time on a Sunday night which was great for us. Food was prepared quickly and we had the pleasure to meet and speak with chef Oscar. We ventured out of our comfort zones to try the black ink squid, which can be an acquired taste at first but easier to enjoy when chef says the ink is shipped from Spain, I would say it's a delicacy. He receives so many fresh produce from other countries, including the delicious peppers that were in our Lomo Saltado. Chef Oscar is very passionate about the art of cooking and you can tell he wants to improve in every way possible. He loves teaching children about eating healthy and customizes his dishes to be a delicious, healthy option. I look forward to returning for flamenco and salsa classes!"}
{"text":"everyone have to try the valenciana paella very nice place to eat thank to Oscar the chef"}
{"text":"Aroma has the best Paella I have ever tried. They use high quality ingredients directly from Spain. I was really excited to find this restaurant as it had a great community vibe. They used to offer flamenco performances and Latin dance meet ups. Unfortunately the restaurant will be closing down and thee owner Oscar will continue his catering business. I am excited to try his catering for special events."}
{"text":"We came for dinner on a Saturday about 7:00 PM and pretty much had the place to ourselves. They were setting up the sound system for the night so maybe the party starts later in the evening at Aroma? I know they have dancers on some days.  I came for the food, not the music, but it was actually pretty nice to watch hispanic music videos and enjoy my authentic Spanish cuisine.  The Empanadas Colombianas were amazing, Steak Empanadas with a chipotle aioli and aji dipping sauce. (I could eat these all day long) The Paella Valenciana is delicious!!! Shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, chicken, chorizo, green peas, green beans, mushrooms, zucchini and squash. Flavor is out of this world!!!! (the left overs made for the most amazing breakfast the next day) The Bandeja Palsa was also fabulous. Steak, pork belly, chorizo, rice, beans, fried plantain, fried egg and avocado. The steak was flavored so perfectly, not over cooked, and tender. Pork Belly and Chorizo were good too, but the star of the plate amid all of that meat,  was the rice and beans........ I couldn't get enough of it.  Loved! Loved! Loved! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome dinner! We came in about 10 days ago. We started with the empanadas. They were delicious as were the sauces that were served with them. My parents had the enchiladas (terrific!!!!!!!) and I tried the bandeja paisa. Everything on that plate, which was quite a bit, was absolutely delicious!!!! Service was great, music by Ricardo griego and the dancers he had for flamenco night were fantastic! Chef Oscar himself came out and introduced himself and made us feel extremely welcome. We'll definitely go back again, and next time I'm definitely getting the paella. Oh yeah, without a doubt, try the sangria too!"}
{"text":"La comida Super rica pedimos una bandeja paisa ya q el Chef es Colombiano el plato es grande tanto que pueden comer 2personas,muy suave y jugosa la carne , los frijoles muy sabrosos ,porkBeli  me encanto y las empanadas  muy bien preparadas  ,también pedimos arepas tenían muy buen sabor  y la atención muy buena regresaremos pronto para comer una paella q me imagino va a estar buena también"}
{"text":"We brought out our family for Flamenco dancing and some Spanish music. We were treated wonderfully and our children had an amazing time,they were even invited to dance! Now for the food. Chef Oscar payed a visit to the table to introduce himself and the menu. The food to say the least was AMAZING!!!!!!! The portions are large, the flavors are perfection and presentation was beautiful. I highly recommend Aromas and we will be back many times."}
{"text":"Wow! Incredible night at Aroma, Cuisine of the World, ribbon cutting and celebration. Food of the world, non GMO and healthier than traditional dishes with no compromise on taste.   Congrats to Chef Oscar Sanchez, Rosa and staff for the successful event. We highly recommend this family-friendly, locally owned mecca of food, celebration and culture.  I highly recommend the paella. We had the negra paella made with squid ink. Rich, of the sea and executed perfectly.   The atmosphere is open, joyous and welcoming. Entry Wednesday night they do a flamenco night that really is a hoot. It would be perfect for a large gathering of friends, family and parties."}
{"text":"We had a craving for some paella and randomly we decided to check Yelp for some suggestions. The search came up with this restaurant and we're thankful that we gave it a shot. Straight to the point, the paella was delicious... Probably the best I've ever had. Heck, even the salsa may have been the best I've ever had. Food aside, that isn't the only thing that makes this restaurant worth a visit. It's the service behind the meal that also made it exceptional. It's not every day where the chef personally comes out from behind the kitchen to have a conversation with you. Clearly, you can tell he has a passion for food and wants to do whatever he can to make your meal an enjoyable one. I've gone to restaurants where you get the paella that they made and that's that... No substitutes whatsoever and no custom orders. Anyhow, before I ramble on any further, I'll just end by saying that I've never given a review before and this place was just that good to motivate me into writing it."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Everything we ordered was delicious!  I had the empanadas. It came with 2 sauces. Also tried the bacon wrapped dates...can never go wrong with that. The sangria was soo good. Then ordered the paella. Had a little bit of everything in it. There was live music playing. The owner came out and was talking to us. Very friendly. Offered to make anything different if we had allergies or anything and wanted to make sure everything was ok. Also told us about the other nights- they have music, dancing, lessons, and karaoke. Sounds fun. I would recommend and definitely plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent food! While the name implies many cuisines, chief among them here are Spanish and Colombian. It's hard to find an authentic taste of Spain here in Las Vegas. The owner/chef Oscar is friendly and personable and clearly knows his food. Unfortunately, we won't be able to return this evening for their Wednesday night Flamenco show with live music, but we hope to make it one of these weeks soon. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was so amazing and the service was definitely five stars! We went on a Wednesday and there was an amazing guitarist \"Ricardo\" and two flamenco dancers! Ricardo is the best guitarist I've seen a long time and with the dancers it was so entertaining! Such a unique experience! Not to mention the best sangria I've ever tasted!!!"}
{"text":"I was here Wednesday night for dinner. Besides the food being  excellent the entertainment was free from 6 to 9. If you're looking for some good Spanish food I would suggest aroma Cusine.   I had the Bandeja Palsa very good. suggested by the waiter. For dessert the bread pudding is excellent.   The guitar player Ricardo Griego and his two very attractive dancers make for  good excellent entertainment  amazing all of this happen because I just wanted to stop by and say hello to the Owner Cesare"}
{"text":"Having just recently moved to Las Vegas from Los Angeles I was looking for a nearby spot that offered a salsa night. Not about Aroma Cafe from the owner and head chef Oscar decided to give it a try. The food was great the atmosphere was great the people there were great."}
