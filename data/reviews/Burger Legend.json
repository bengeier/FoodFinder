{"text":"Great burger! Went 6/24/2015 during Yelp Burger Binge. Got the Great One (it's the feature). Fantastic, fresh patty, and the maple bacon is glorious (you can taste the maple). Bawss sauce is good too. Normally don't like mayo-based sauces, but this one's an exception. Would definitely be back. Dude at the front (Darion) is friendly and helpful to noobs like me."}
{"text":"OK here is my issue. My wife walls with a cane with write a bit of difficulty.  Trying this place out park in the back and lo and behold they have a back entrance, but they don't, can't cut through the kitchen, suggest you either take the sign down or put something up that says not an entrance.  Then I go to use a coupon offered on yelp an told it's not being honored because that deal went off a while ago.  Yelp why do I still show it if it's not good.  Anyway the food could be the best I've ever had but a series of small, not handled issues will make sure we won't be back.  To bad."}
{"text":"So from reading the other reviews, it seems like Burger Legend can be a bit inconsistent. My experience--I just needed to grab lunch quickly in Streetsville--was pretty positive. The service was very friendly, and my food came out relatively quickly (~10 minutes for a fresh-made burger is totally acceptable).   As a bit of a self-proclaimed \"burger snob\", at this point it's probably most helpful to compare and contrast the food at Burger Legend (BL) to the food of its competitors:  BL vs. Five Guys -The bacon on the BL burgers is HEAD AND SHOULDERS above the competition in terms of tastiness, including Five Guys. If real, thick, tasty bacon is your priority, BL is a good spot--I all but gave up ordering bacon on my burgers at Five Guys because it's just tasteless crunch. Quality of the patties is probably comparable; they taste different, but I don't think one is necessarily better than the other. I probably lean towards Five Guys if I want a basic greasy/cheesy burger, and BL if I want something more excited. My fries at BL were decent, but I think most other places (Five Guys included) beat BL in terms of how tasty (and apparently, consistent?) the fries are.   BL vs. the Works -The Works probably has better burgers and definitely better fries than BL, and a lot more diversity in terms of the burgers they offer. And they have a decent selection of beer. However, food-portion wise, I feel like the Works gives you WAY too much food, and I always feel crappy when I end up wasting a  bunch of it. Also, BL seems like the kind of place it'd be easier to quickly get in and out of, whereas the Works might oblige you to a longer sit-down affair. So yea, if I was craving something exciting, and the Works was nearby, I'd probably go for the Works over BL. But if I just wanted something close or basic, BL is probably good enough to displace the Works.   BL vs. Burgers Priest -Burgers Priest, with few exceptions has better burgers and WAY better fries than BL. And those deep-friend breaded jalape√±os are just dynamite... But each time I get a single patty burger at Burgers Priest, I find it's not enough, whereas BL felt \"just right\". However, though I'm not a vegetarian, it seems like Burgers Priest has MUCH stronger vegetarian offerings than BL. So day in and day out, if they are equidistantly located, I'd probably lean Burgers Priest most days, unless I was really craving some of that good BL bacon.   So long story short, if you're int Streetsville and are craving a burg, Burger Legend is probably worth a stop in. They are friendly, quick, local, and the quality of food is good. One thing I'll mention is that I think they could use the space they have way more efficiently--the tall circular tables take up a lot of surface area that could be used to fit more horizontal booths (or some other seating set-up). Nice to have a decent burger joint just a few minutes away from home!"}
{"text":"My friends and I visited this new burger joint in Streetsville last night because of Yelp's Burger Binge Week. Burger Legend offered their signature burger, The Great One, for $5...plus a free drink with a check-in on Facebook.  The restaurant is small and the decor is very minimal. With a few tables and bar stools, they also have three TVs (now playing the FIFA World Cup games). The cashier was very friendly and quick to take our orders. We waited about 20 minutes for the food. Even though we had a table, each order came in individual paper bags, which I find was quite wasteful.  Fresh Canadian beef patty, maple-smoked bacon, mixed greens (a.k.a. a bit of lettuce), tomatoes, and Bawss sauce. I really liked the thick slice of bacon, while the bun and beef patty tasted fresh. But overall, I did not find the burger was anything special. My friends and I thought the patty was quite small, too. For $5, it was all right, but I'm not sure it's worth the usual $9 for such a simple burger.   We also ordered a large maple-smoked bacon poutine. The fries were soggy with a generous amount of cheese curds and gravy. I was disappointed to see how little bacon was added... (The maple-smoked bacon was truly the highlight of last night's meal.)  All things considered, it's nice to have a burger joint in Streetsville -- another great option when you are in the area. I am not a fan of The Great One, but I wouldn't mind giving their other burgers a try."}
{"text":"What they make, they make very well. I had the final shootout burger its a two beef patty bacon double cheese burger. And I had a poutine as well. This isn't a knock on the burger, if you like your burger loaded with toppings get the single patty burger its easier to eat loaded. The double is a lot of beef lol. I'm sure I'll be coming back many more times as it was a fair price for good food."}
{"text":"We wanted to try \"  burger legend\" today simply because our friends luv this place.  We had the burger and poutine & it was awesome..! I will go back for sure;)!!!!! The  place was nice and small with cool high tables!"}
{"text":"I just enjoyed The Great One burger with fries and a Coke. The bacon on it was thick and crispy. I highly recommend this burger."}
{"text":"Came across this by accident looking for a burger fix for lunch.  Great gem of a spot for fellow burger lovers. I tried their classic burger and a Coke. Was very tasty, solid quality and reasonably priced. I will be back."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday to try this place out. The flavour of my burger was great but the patty crumbled right away and I had to eat it with a fork & knife. The fries are really good here too. Overall it was a good meal. I like how they do the portobello mushrooms with the panko flakes. It adds something extra texture wise to the burger. I'm taking one star off due to one of the employees. It's a small place, and while I was waiting, one of the managers (I'm assuming she was a manager or perhaps she was the owner?) proceeded to tell the female working the counter how she was signing in & out of the system wrong for her shifts and how it was a big pain in the a$$, complaining as she had to correct it. I realize it's a casual atmosphere, and I realize they are all young working there, however there should still be a form of professionalism happening here. Never do that in front of the customer. I feel bad for the girl. Instead, do it in private (and don't swear to your employee)."}
{"text":"This burger place is disappointing.   I ordered a classic burger and a poutine.  Starting with the poutine: it was just wrong. The fries, cheese curds and gravy all tasted off and had weird textures. The fries had the consistency of steamed carrots. Every time I tried to capture some on my fork, they would just flake apart. And yet they still somehow had a raw flavor to them. The gravy tasted metallic and not at all how gravy should taste. The cheese curds just tasted like cheap mozzarella cheese. On top of that, the curds in no way held their shape or felt like curds at all.  On to the burger... It wasn't terrible. It just didn't feel like a burger. More like ground beef smashed together into the shape of a burger. I know that's TECHNICALLY what a burger patty is but what sets amazing burger joint apart is the seasoning, quality of the meat and juiciness. This one was dry and crumbled apart. The bun was nice though so there's that.  Maybe some of their other items are better. If I end up here again I'll try one of their fancier burgers. I will definitely steer clear of the poutine though. Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"I ordered a poutine from here by using ubereats and it hurts me to say this but that was the worst poutine I've ate in all my life I've been living here because fir one some of the fries were not even cooked fully it was like I ? eating a potato without cooking it and the worst thing is the cheese they used for the poutine was so disgusting it tasted like those fake pre-wrapped cheese slices u would get from the grocery store. It was just horrible, please if u see this I would suggest u change your cheese Cause that was unacceptable. I can make better poutine then that."}
{"text":"Better than fast food burgers but pretty mediocre. Pretty small as well.  Fries not so good either.  Tasted dry and old.  Soda machine out of order."}
{"text":"Waited over 45 minutes only to receive the wrong burger and it was not warm.  They clearly forgot about our order and there didn't seem to be a manager present. Not a good experience. Over rated in my opinion."}
{"text":"As a self proclaimed burger connoisseur, this place rocks!  Nothing fancy here, just great, fresh burgers and the best poutine you've had outside of Quebec!  Very limited seating and not very comfortable, but the food is what makes this place my burger go to!"}
{"text":"The burger is really, really good. The sauce is good too. The fries are a hit and miss, and in the last few months; mostly a miss.   I've been giving the restaurant so many chances on the fries. The last 6 or so months, I've visited the restaurant once every month.   Yesterday, I decided to give the fries another try and lo and behold: burnt up again. It seems like the oil isn't changed often.    I'm sick of paying $4 for burnt up fries. Picture is attached. Hopefully the owner fixes this soon.   I hate to write bad reviews. I'm hoping the owner fixes this issue forever. I'll be more than glad to help the owner out by removing this review if the fries are fixed."}
{"text":"I went to Burger Legend a month ago and got their \"Great One\" burger with fries on the side.  I know BL praises itself for their fresh patties and all but the burger just tasted meh, I mean it literally didn't taste any different to me than an average burger from Hero Burgers or Five Guys... The bacon was actually the differential factor - it tasted amazing, it was juicy,crisp, and flavorful.   Overall I'd give it a 2.5-3 - would I go outside of my way to go there to grab a burger? Probably not, I mean i'd have indifferent utility to a Whopper from Burger King."}
{"text":"Great spot in streetsville. Burgers are made fresh and cant you tell! The fries as well.. They even have malt vinegar. It is amazing. Cant wait for them to get beer.."}
{"text":"I was there with bunch of food lovers and we can to check out the newest and hottest burger joint in Streetsville.  First impression entering the restaurant, it was quite clean and appealing to sit in and eat burgers.   Jessica (nice lady at the till) then gave us all the insides on how the don't use frozen meat and don't have any freezers as all the meat is purchased fresh every day and they use real Canadian cheese.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating and the kitchen staff bringing the food checked on us once all the food was out, even then owner himself came to check if everything was good.  I confirmed with the shop staff and the meat here is not Halal, so I went with their veggie burger. The Veggie burger was panko-crusted portobello mushroom, very nice crispy crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and included cheddar cheese, mixed greens, sliced tomato, and Bawss sauce. Wow! my tummy went AWESOME!!! I thoroughly enjoyed the burger.  I also enjoyed their regular fries and their poutine. The poutine had chucks of cheese which was nice and the gravy was quite good. One person in our group was vegetarian and he was assured that the sauce in the poutine is vegetarian friendly.   I like the fact that you receive a free drink when you check in on Facebook, Tweet or connect with them through Instagram.   The parking is a little problem so you will have hunt it down in the back streets. Note for now would be they are only excepting cash now till they are fully set up and running.  All in all quite a good experience!"}
{"text":"I finally got to Burger Legend... lots of radio advertisements. I went in around 730-8 pm.  I wanted to order the North Burger... but the sticky on the board(see pic) said sold out. I asked the cashier why is it sold out, she explained avocado was expensive and ripens fast. I hope that was because of the time of day.... If not And you are going to 86 an item.. why use a tacky pink sticky. Have it removed from the board. Kind of Ghetto guys. Marks deducted. I ordered the Fusion Burger. Portobello deep fried with patty. I was upsold on the \"amazing poutine\". When I got the order it was presented on a wooden leaf board with the poutine in a styrofoam container (Huh? Who uses styrofoam anymore) marks deducted. The Burger had some sorry looking limp lettuce on the BOTTOM of my burger ( a first in burger history see pic) marks deducted. LETTUCE ON TOP. Sesame bun.. fresh, crisp and light. Patty delicious. Portobello mushroom..I believe to be a bit too ripe...tasty. Poutine in the horrible styrofoam container had my cheese curds cold even with hot gravy covered. Curds were large balls of cold cheese. Marks deducted. Gravy was average. Fries ok. I did not finish the poutine.... tonnes of left over cold cheese. Overall I think Burger Legend could become more of a Legend if a few things were changed. Service was friendly. Limited seating. I would go back to try something else. My meal was $20.00. A bit pricey for what it was...3-4 dollars over priced. I would give the poutine a second chance."}
{"text":"The Yelp Burger Brigade invaded yet another unsuspecting GTA burger joint and on this momentous occasion, our brigade tested the true might the Burger Legend.  It's not a big space, so diner beware you best be sure to get their first to grab yourself one of the coveted spots. And with the sheer size of the burgers this place is pushing out, you better believe that you're gonna need the extra elbow room to get into these tasty burgs.  I went for the Double Shootout (I actually can't be sure if that's the exact name, I went coma midway through the burger). But basically it's The Great One doubled. Which means you get two patties, two pieces of cheese, toppings and their signature maple smoked bacon.   ..lemme pause for a second to talk about this maple smoked sex! Yes, it's basically the food equivalent of sex. It's pork, it's crispy, it's chewy, it's... MAPLE!!! So maple in fact that I kept getting whiff of pancakes and maple syrup - it was glorious.  Also, if you want fresh never frozen, this is the place for you SON. They don't even own a freezer - NOPE! Everything is made fresh to order which is why a burger takes about 10 minutes to prepare. So the beef is fresh, the bacon is maple, and what about the cheese? Oh ya that is 100% fresh Canadian cheddar, not processed, not even a little. It's the holy trinity of a great burger - they have every right to pay homage to Wayne Gretzky with their \"The Great One\" burger, because it's spectacular (especially when you eat it twice).  Lastly, let's talk about their fries, fried twice in vegetable oil so they're crispy. Not enough, ok how about adding some fresh cheese curds and vegetarian gravy. Yum Right? Oh, still not happy? Well then there is no pleasing you is there... How about we add some of that maple bacon on top of it? Ohhhhhh now you're getting weak at the knees. WINNER!  If you're in Streetsville I recommend you pay these guys a visit. Their food is as great as their story (started from a food truck...now they're here - in Streetsville).  CASH ONLY - Their debit/credit machine is not working yet.  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Great food and service, wish they'd try and do something about the interior. I ended up eating in my car because it was more welcoming."}
{"text":"Burger Legend doesn't even deserve a star. Went there on Family Day and boy were we disappointed. Burger sucks not worth the money actually made us all sick with diarrhea and vomiting all night. The fries w were wet and soggy. Place looks dirty. Don't waste your money on this joint. That's why they advertise on the radio cause they suck!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my co-workers heard about this place via a website featuring the \"best burger places in Mississauga\" and we decided to give it a shot.  Having been to Burger's Priest, Holy Chuck The Works, etc. I will say that this place wasn't bad.  The Good: - the staff was friendly and chatty, very polite and professional. - free drink if you check in via Social Media. - the burger - while messy it was very flavorful and tasted great! - the price wasn't bad and adding fries or upgrading to poutine is fairly cheap. - maple bacon. on the burger or in the poutine, it's great.  The Bad: - parking in this area is a bit of a pain. - there's very little seating space. - the website.  (it's just terrible) - menu selection.  There's only ~10 or so types of food.  Compared to other burger specialty places, that's very small.  All-in-all, I would definitely go back a second time around, but I wouldn't make it a regular place, especially when there's a Burrito Boys in the same neighborhood."}
{"text":"Okay! Take 2...I went back and tried their classic burger, I have couple of things to say about it, First and foremost, not a fan of the pressed down burger buns, the bottom bun of was super thin and soggy ( i get the picture, \"its more about the meat not the bun\"  but I am not fan, I would then just serve an open faced burger or order thin pretzel buns or order just bottoms from a bakery. secondly their house sauce was way too salty, but the patty was fresh and juicy, and also the mixed greens were shredded iceberg lettuce? that did nothing for my burger...  This time around  the service was weird ( different person at the counter  )  so now I am on the fence I am not sure if i want to go back and try their Great one or just move onto a different burger shop..  Also The paper bag for dine in,  is just plain and simple waste and expensive, if the owner doesn't mind wasting money, then should think about saving paper..   Quick overall  Customer Service =Excellent or weird  ( hit or miss )  Quality = Good or ok  Decor =Decent Value =Good ( a slider with bacon was $5.00+) and classic burger was 6.00+  Would I repeat?  Maybe...  PS. I have tried so far 5 Guys and fries, On the Bun Burger, Burger Factory, The Fire Pit, South Street Burger, Apache Burger, John Anderson Charcoal Broil Burger, Hero Certified burger, Sonny's drive in, Harvey's, Jumbo Burger, Wally's family Restaurant, Burger Shack , Licks  and Swiss Chelet  The joints mentioned above, some are worthy of returning and some are not"}
{"text":"Great little burger spot in Streetsville. Went with my boyfriend and we each got a burger and split a poutine! The service was fast and polite.  The food was great and the portions were really massive, too much food for two people.  Overall, great burger spot if you're in the area, but not really worth the stretch to make it your go-to spot if you're not from the area."}
{"text":"The burgers are indeed legendary. I mean, they're really, really good. I came in for a quick lunch and, after staring through their menu and simultaneously wiping away the drool from my mouth, I ordered the great one (because maple bacon). The girl behind the counter deserves a raise, because she up-sold me on fries with gravy as a side, which was definitely more than I could handle.   The meat is fantastic, clearly not frozen and cooked perfectly. The maple bacon obviously is a great selling point. The choose your own toppings (a la Harveys) is the best, and I didn't get any judgmental looks when I asked for 5 slices of pickles, just because I could. The bawss sauce is good, but I honestly couldn't taste it very much (maybe because of the pickles?). Love that you can get a cheese without having to pay extra.  The fries were the letdown. I mean, they weren't terrible, but they certainly weren't anything to write home about. Maybe some people like them, but I prefer my fries to be crispy and these ones weren't. Even the little ones weren't crunchy enough. They gravy was delicious, and helped me pack away as many fries as I could, but I was in over my head. Next time I'll only just grab a burger, which was the perfect lunch."}
{"text":"I went here on a weeknight and ordered the All-Day Burger. It might be the best burger I've tasted in Mississauga. The fried egg mixed very well with the sauce and the bacon was thick-cut and crispy, definitely of good quality. For an extra dollar you can add a large order of poutine! Aside from the good value and taste, what surprised me the most was the customer service. The staff was very friendly and polite, always smiling, and ensuring my friends and I were satisfied. The restaurant certainly didn't have that busy, fast-food feel. I would most definitely visit again! Recommendations: The Great One and the All-Day Burger."}
{"text":"Bacon was perfect, nice and crispy, with a hint of maple.  Burger was good. I may re-review on a single paddy burger, I think the double was just too much burger for me.  Probably the best non-chain burger place in North-west Mississauga. Definitely the best burger I've had in Streetsville.  My wife didn't like the cheese they put in the poutine.. it's not exactly cheese curds, seems more like mozzarella or something. Could be wrong ;)  Overall a tasty place."}
{"text":"Meaty juicy goodness!! I opted for the all day burger because why on earth would I pass on fried eggs over a succulent pattie and cheese?? Meat was fresh, and best of all juicy and not overly cooked. You can taste the freshness as you take each bite because it falls into little crumbles of ground beef, no additives here. Maple bacon was a great surprise as it added the perfect combination of sweet and salty to the burger. $9 dollars for a burger is a bit much in my opinion, $12 if you add the poutine. Fries were nice and thick although gravy was a tad too salty for my liking the cheese curds helped. Although I really enjoyed the burger, it is quite pricey for the \"fast food\" type of decor style. Seats were all too high for younger children to sit on safely."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because of the YELP burger week promotion; and I'm sure glad we did.  It was nice to see that there was a fresh burger where it was not pressed and compacted into a hockey puck.  This was a nice all beef loosely packed juicy burger of awesomeness with some amazing bacon and a soft bun with a tasty sauce and some green stuff tucked in there too.  What pushes this place to a great neighborhood burger place is the friendly staff, and that this is a very clean place to enjoy a meal and the best part about it is if you check in on your social media (in front of them) they will give you a free drink.  Todays burger was called \"the great one\" and i agree it was a great burger.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Burger was awesome!  There is definitely a \"freshness\" to the burger that stands out when you bite Into it. That patty is 100% beef son and you can tell. It breaks up so easily when you chew it. I wouldnt say it \"melted\" but was still the closest thing ive come to that experiance. The bacon had more texture than the patty! SRS. The bacon here was the best bacon I've ever had on a burger. It's not crazy thick but thick enough to taste and feel every bite of it. It was also maple bacon, the smell of syrup enticed my swnses ever time i moved in for another bite. There signature sauce is a Chipotle Mayo...nuff said about that. Also I'd be crazy not to get a fried egg on top of my burger when I'm presented with such divinity.  However the egg was the falling for the burger...there was no runny yolk  isn't that the whole point?! Regardless best burger to date! Should have gotten their maple poutine also but the time for poutine will be showcased on its own. (Smokes I'm coming for you. )"}
{"text":"Didn't know this opened up in Streetsville, as we drive by a few times. Instead of eating in we did a takeout of two veggie burgers and poutine combos.   During the peak hours the restaurant seemed empty which was surprising. The person on the order desk was knowledgeable and answered all questions. He did the toppings in front of us and takes the burger buns to the kitchen for the cooked burgers to be topped.   The burgers are Portobello mushroom with stuffed cheese and coated with  panko breadcrumbs and deep fried. The burger also comes with your choice of Swiss or Cheddar cheese. The toppings are limited but ok. Their signature sauce is thinned out chipotle sauce - needs to be worked on. The burger is really good and flavour amazing. The buns are only downer in the burger (other than the signature sauce). But otherwise really good.   The fries are a knockout- fresh cut, fried perfectly. The veggie gravy really good and full of flavour. The cheese curds, didn't seem like cheese curds but rather than a slice of mozzarella cheese. Perhaps this was because we took out. Will try again and see if it repeats. But overall a good a poutine.   Would definitely return. Good value for money. A hidden gem perhaps. 4.5 stars out of 5"}
{"text":"I don't see what the rave is about. The patty is very thin, buns too thick. Tastes no better than chain fast food joints, but charges a lot more. Won't come back"}
{"text":"This place is fairly new and only accepted cash (for now?). We didn't have enough cash to try a burger/poutine combo so decided to order a large poutine to share. The gravy was amazingly tasty but not too salty. They use real cheese curds which is always a plus. Fries were made from fresh potatoes but by the time we got them home they were kind of soggy. Am very curious about their burgers (meat ground fresh each day). Looking forward to trying them."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger in mississauga, worth my drive from Hamilton twice a week.   They really play with the texture. Some places will give you big juicy burgers where the meat is cooked evenly throughout. Sure it's great but Burger Legend does it with a twist. It's crispy(not burned) enough on the outside and succulent on the inside. Then come the buns (just the right amount of carbs to hold it all down), the topings (never too much to mask the meat), the cheese is always done right and melted on the burger sometimes skirted outside the bun (so pay for the extra it's really good).  The only downside is that they sometimes run out of meat. I never understood why not get some freezers....but that's how they do it."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Got the $5 Great One during the Yelp Burger Binge Week to give Burger Legend a 2nd try.  -I added sauteed onions, mayo and pickles. -Ordered fries -Checked in to Facebook for free pop  So I paid less than $9 for a gourmet burger joint tax-in.  By adding the sauteed onions and mayo, the taste was amazing.  However my biggest complaint is that while the bun tastes great, it falls apart too easily.  I had to ask for a fork 1/2 way through.  I also liked the fact that they have sea salt for the fries. SCORE!  Also, service has improved from the last visit and they now take debit.  Verdict: great tasting burger but messy."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had. They give out free buns everyday for those in need. I always come since it's near my work to support local business."}
{"text":"My new favourite burger joint in mississauga! Burger was juicy and sauce was amazing and fries were just to die for! Will definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Tried my traditional cheeseburger and fries and was not very impressed.   The burger was good but I guess I was expecting more when you put legend in your name.   I will not make the trek back out to this location but I would not doubt that other signature burgers may have impressed me more.   Patty was good and tasty and also thick.   All in all its a decent place but Mississauga is just too big and parking too crazy here for me to venture to try again."}
{"text":"Alright, I'll write a review for Burger Legend. It's been around a couple of months now, and I've been here a handful of times, but now that it's part of Yelp's Burger Binge Week event I just HAVE to write a review ($5 Great One burgers June 22-28th 2014).  I've only ever tried one of their burgers - they refer to it as The Great One. Special toppings include maple bacon (mmm) and bawss sauce, which is some kind of secret recipe I'm guessing. Their patties are made of fresh beef (they don't even own a freezer!). Because of this, you will have to wait 10 or so minutes for your order.  Each time I have The Great One, I like it more and more. I've grown to love how the cuts of bacon are thicker than most other bacon burger offerings. The bawss sauce doesn't stand out - rather, it blends complementarily with the other flavours (cop out I know, I'll pay more attention to the sauce's taste next time and update my review!).  I've also tried the maple bacon poutine that they offer. Traditional poutine with maple bacon, nothing more. It's not bad, but I'd never make the trek to Streetsville because of it.   One thing I plan to try in the future is their All-Day Burger, featuring a fried egg. The staff recommended for me to try that for next time.   On to the place itself - it's small, just about the size of the other establishments in Streetsville. It's very minimal in design and furniture, and you may have to wait to sit down during it's busy periods. They have a random basketball on the ceiling. That's about it."}
{"text":"I really liked the burger I had at Burger Legend. I tried the \"classic\". I wish I had known about the toppings because I didn't order any (I didn't ask and she didn't tell me). I think about $9. We had the poutine as a side and I really liked the cheese curds. The fries didn't completely stand out for me. It was really neat how they don't have any freezers here and their ingredients are delivered fresh daily. I did like the burger the best out of what I tried here. I wish they had more on the menu. It's just burgers, fries, and pop. I wanted something sweet after and the few other burger joints I've been to did have dessert options. That being said, the burger was quite tasty and I would not hesitate to visit again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"So having been a vegetarian for many, many years some may think that it's not quite right for me to be reviewing burger places. To those people I would say:   \"You are wrong and how dare you stand in the way of my quest to bring the best in veggie burger advice to fellow herbivores all across the GTA!?\"  Okay, so I probably wouldn't say exactly that but you get my point. There needs to be a voice for the voiceless, i.e. this cruel world of ever more delicious burgers in which vegetarians have traditionally been left out! Am I that voice? Who knows, but I'll give 'er a go!  I went here about a month or so ago as part of Yelp's Burger Brigade and made sure to call ahead and check to see that there was a a vegetarian option They said yes, so I trekked over. Sadly, I did not end eating a burger regardless. Why you may ask? They don't actually have a veggie burger option. It's a portabello burger thing. And I hate, HATE mushrooms and couldn't choke one down if you paid me a small fortune to do so.   So it's a fail. As much as I want to be nice and as cool as the folks at Burger Legend are for welcoming all the Yelpers to this event, I really feel the need to warn folks that a mushroom on a bun is not a suitable vegetarian option when it comes to burgers. A soy patty / meat analogue is ideal. A bean burger or one of those odd but often tasty mixed vegetable things works. Portabello mushrooms in between two buns does not and never will. I've consulted several people, vegetarians and non-vegetarians and those who are not mushroom averse. All have agreed with me. It's just not a veggie burger, plain and simple.   Am I being a bit harsh with Burger Legend? Probably and for that I do apologize. Everything I've heard and read tells me that that have solid burgers for meat eaters but I'm grading on a different scale. Mushroom burger doesn't do the trick, it's not legit. Doesn't taste like a burger, can't do the same things with it and it just isn't a real alternative. Sadly, this isn't the only place that does this. I'll have to deal with those in the very near future as well!  Give me a better option and I'll be more than happy to give you guys another go. The poutine I had there (veg gravy) was pretty decent and I would give it another shot. Now how's about an actual veggie burger?"}
{"text":"Aside few needing a bigger sign :) this is a perfect burger joint. Fresh patties, simple menu where you can also customize to make your own creation. EXCELLENT FRIES. I have nothing to add. Maybe a sugar-free caffeine free soda? But I'm just being fussy... I will be back for sure. Liked it better than some of the local (chain and non-chain) competitors."}
{"text":"This is really a 4 and a 1/2. A really good burger! When you just need a good burger this is it. Got \"The Great One\" and a bacon poutine. The burger was great, customizable toppings and good bacon to burger ratio, you basically get bacon with every bite (I hate when you get a bacon burger and it comes with a tiny piece of bacon right in the middle). The burger patty is seasoned nicely too, almost tastes like Montreal steak spice. The poutine was really good! Having the maple bacon on top is always a plus, but good fries, good gravy and real cheese curds. Never got soggy. Service was good too. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was hoping for a good burger experience in my own backyard of Mississauga.    I'm sad to say that would not be the case.  Situated in the heart of historic Streetsville where our beloved Mayor Hazel McCallion likes to roam, Burger Legend is yet another burger joint vying for that coveted gourmet burger title.  Street parking during lunch time can be a difficult to find as there are no private lots, but with some determination and driving around, you should have no trouble.  I arrived at Burger Legend one weekday afternoon around lunch hour.  There was only one single soul in the restaurant.  The bar styled tables were high in stature, transparent glass.    The attendant, a nice lady on her iPad order system recommended the Great One.  I opted for the classic instead: mixed greens, tomatoes, their special :Bawsss\" sauce, cheddar cheese.  I told her that I would like mine without tomatoes please, and pleae also add grilled onions, pickles.  I also ordered a side of fries to go along with the burger.  15 minutes later, my meal was delivered to my table.   First impressions were not good.   Because, for one, the fries looked miserable in its cup.  Dark, wet, mushy and wilted.  I guess only the burgers get the fresh treatment.  Biting into my fries - it was very soft and mushy, not the usual crisp crunch I'm used to.  Heck, even your standard McDonald's, Burger King makes better fries.  Burger Legend's fries seem to have sat in the deep fryer far too long and they absorbed all of that oil, resulting in a limpy, darkened soggy fries.  Not to mentioned, an overly amount of grease lingered on my fingers.    None too pleased I put the fries down and hoped the burger would be better.  The burgers too were wet and soggy, and I immediately noticed a thick slice of tomatoes when I had asked for none.  I could feel all of their special sauce had dripped off underneath the wrapper of the burger, resulting in a cold touch. I hope the burger wasn't the same.    Thank goodness, the burger patty itself was hot and fresh.  However, because of the cooler temperature of the sauce interacting with the hot burger, the sogginess of the buns came through and also made the mixed chopped lettuce very wet and soggy as well.  The burger bun, despite it being toasted on the outside was very mushy and full of moisture on the inside.    I could barely held the burger together.    The way my burger was put together lacked finesse, the mark of an inexperienced cook.  For a $10 meal, (free can of pop if you check in on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram) I expected an elevated burger experience.    I hope they improve going forward in their presentation and technique.  The lucrative fresh hamburger market is at an all time high and Burger Legend could one day live up to its name - if they want to!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the classic burger.  Nice tasting bun and fresh toppings. Meat patty was cooked nice and juicy. Service was average."}
{"text":"Great burgers nice and freshly made everyday, the maple bacon is unreal and adds a very Canadian flavour to it all!"}
{"text":"I was here Friday with a friend. It's was our first time here. We don't live in the area, but heard about it on the radio. We wanted to check it out.  I asked the cashier which burger was popular. She recommended \"the great one\" so that's what I ordered with a side of Canadian maple poutine, and had to get a can of ice tea for a drink because there fountain drink was out of order. ( according to other reviews, It looks like it's been not working for at least a month now)  Well I got my burger and honestly I wasn't impressed. Here's what the problem was. First of all when you serve a burger, never put the beef patty on top of lettuce , especially on shredded lettuce and when wrapped it acts as an oven and cooks the lettuce and makes it wilted. It reminds me of mcdonalds quarter pounder when microwaved. The meat was overcooked and under seasoned, it resulted in a bland burger. A burger made from fresh ground meat should be seasoned and cooked to medium and served with crispy lettuce that should not touch the meat until you eat it. A higher end burger joint will serve you a burger on a platter when eating in and not wrap it up like a fast food joint.  The poutine was alright. The fries are homemade and curds where melted under the tasty gravy. The way I like it. The only thing I didn't like is how they put the bacon on the poutine. The bacon was cut into too big a pieces and should be cut into smaller pieces so you could get it in every bite.  My friend ordered the double with bacon and cheese. He thought it was good. But he is not a foodie like I am.  So burger legend might be good for an average joe like my friend. But I don't think think it's a contender with the high end joints like \"burger priest\" and my favourite \"burgernator\". It's just a wannabe and run by lazy owners. You can tell by fountain drink not working and the bathroom door that doesn't shut."}
{"text":"#BURGER #YELP #STREETSVILLE #FASTFOOD #SAUGA  Ah Shucks. Like Tasha, I tried the Classic Burger and the lady at the counter didn't tell me about the toppings. The burger came a little dry so I had to ask for extra Mayo to really enjoy it. What I liked though, that the burger was quite light and the bread was thinner than usual and really yummy. Apparently it's all made with fresh ingredients, just like how a burger should be...  I wish they had some Organic choices.   I really want to come back here when I am hungrier and on a cheat day because I'd really like to try some of their bigger burgers and poutine. The poutine looked AMAZING."}
{"text":"Burger Legend, a local hamburger shop that prides in not having any freezers. That means their beef are fresh and with freshness, you get to charge a premium for it.   The quality of food is good for the burger you get however because paying for the quality of the food results in the premium , it is steeper on the price hike than you would see from other burger places.  It is a worthwhile try if you are in the area and are a burger enthusiast. However for me, I've tried it once before to experience and that was as much as I enjoyed it till."}
{"text":"Sometimes a legend is better left unexplored.  Not much seating, yet they have this huge almost unused bar area.  Definitely could have a better use of space.  Not much decor.  I ordered a cheeseburger and fries.  Apparently they cannot do a cheeseburger it has to be one of their named burgers...  So I asked for the first one on the menu, don't recall what it was called.  Then said I do not want the toppings it comes with and gave a list of toppings I prefer.  When I get the burger it does have my toppings... and the default ones as well.  Not impressed. The burger itself was fresh.  Could have used a little more seasoning and I definitely should have ordered a double as the single was tiny and almost disappeared in the bun.  I should have guessed once they rang up the bill.  $10 was too good to be true. Fries... meh.  I will likely give the place another shot eventually.  When I do, I'll get a double and make clear that I do not want the topping choices they recommend."}
{"text":"Don't understand what all the hype is about. My burger was nothing special and was overpriced. Won't be back here."}
{"text":"The double cheeseburger was excellent. Freshly made. Great taste. Buns were a bit small for the price, but the overall thing was worth it. Will go again!"}
{"text":"My co-worker suggested for us to try out Burger Legend because he thought it was Burger Priest lol.   We dropped by for lunch around noon and had our orders taken right away. We both got the original burger and shared the poutine. It didn't take too long for us to receive our order. I thought for the price I was paying the burger would be bigger. The poutine was great because of the fresh fries and delicious gravy.  The inside of Burger Legend is quite minimal and cold feeling. There are about four high top tables.  Overall, Burger Legend was just average. I don't think I'll be coming back for another burger."}
{"text":"Got a halal cheeseburger and Poutine and felt the bun was way too thin so it kept falling apart. It's quite messy but the patty is good quality meat and the Poutine was awesome. Limited seating and despite having a huge \"Student Special\" sign outside, they don't offer any."}
{"text":"Ordered a Poutine .. food was great until I discovered a hair in it. Didn't see the cook wearing a hair net ... customer service was great"}
{"text":"3.5 sounds 'bout right.  Pumped up 'cause they offered a free drink with Facebook check-in...BONUS!  Check-in to both Yelp ($5 burger promo) + Facebook (free drink) were seamless.  Greeting was friendly and informative, letting us know that they did not have any freezers in the back, high-grade Canadian beef is used, fries are freshly cut, no process cheese, etc.  All good to know and sounds a heckuva lot better than that alleged pink sludge place!  Food came in a brown paper bag.  I thought that was a bit weird since my friend & I were sitting down.  I also saw a brown paper bag arrive to someone else's table who was dining-in.  Are there no trays??  \"The Great One\" which is basically a cheeseburger with bawss sauce (mayo-based), the typical fixings, and maple bacon was good.  You can tell the patty is not previously frozen as it's soft and not chewy.  The only thing that I wasn't too fond of was the fact that the bun was pressed, so it sorta arrives toasted.  I prefer a soft bun.  We also ordered a small poutine to round off the #BurgerBinge of the evening.  It was awh-ight.  Tons of gelatinous gravy on top, cheese wasn't squeaky, but it came in \"curd\" shape, and fries were soggy.  Not to best poutine I have ever had in the GTA, but not the worse either.  I assumed the place would be dead due to the location, but I think Yelp's promo definitely brought in the crowds!"}
{"text":"The burger took forever to be ready and I do get that they use fresh ingredients so i was prepared to wait. What I wasn't prepared for was a very under seasoned patty. Because of this the meat was tasteless and the burger didn't really hit the spot. I don't think I will return here. I will say that all the ingredients seemed fresh as stated, and you pay for it."}
{"text":"Was craving for a serious burger for dinner last week and Burger Legend helped helped satisfy that!   Had myself \"the Great One\" - which had Maple smoked bacon, mixed greens, tomatoes, and their in house \"Bawss Sauce\" along with a side order of fries. The burger itself was pretty good - better than a five guys or hero burger offering, and the bacon slices were fairly massive in comparison to other bacon-topped burgers I've had. The bread was soft and the patty was juicy and flavourful, however I didn't really notice much of what the \"Bawss Sauce\" was supposed to taste like, which was a smidge of a letdown. In addition, I thought it was a bit odd that the buns were a bit bigger than the patty, but the patty was fairly dense in comparison so I suppose that made up for it.  The fries were nothing fancy, almost like Wendy's fries but cooked a bit longer and were a smidge on the crispy side which was pretty good. For a small, side serving of fries however it was definitely a good size!   Glad I tried it and I'll probably come back again for one of their other burgers  3.5/5"}
{"text":"Saw that there was a Yelp burger deal so I headed to Burger Legend on my lunch break and ordered it up   Never a dissapointment! I had to disassemble the burger and savour that amazing Maple Bacon  by itself... OMG so thick and soooo tasty.  FRESH MEAT!! and a savouring bite after bite!"}
{"text":"I would give them a 3.5.  They gave me a free drink for checking in on Facebook.  I had \"the great one\" their specialty burger. It had a preset selection of toppings and of course if you didn't want a topping you may let them know. They combo their burgers with routines and I went with the maple bacon. Their bacon is crispy and nice but you can't really taste the maple.  They were playing FIFA so my friends and I decided to eat there. The wait is pretty long so keep that in mind when going here, waited about 10-15 mins for my burger."}
{"text":"I've been to Burger Legend multiples times and have been thoroughly impressed each trip. The bests burgers in the city hands down. I would strongly advise checking it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Burger Legend March 2016 The Great One Burger with Maple Bacon Regular fries. The burger was better than Hero Burger and the maple bacon was thick and very good. Hand cut thick fries were excellent. We will be back to try the Poutine."}
{"text":"This was my first burger brigade adventure with our fearless leader Kris and what a great group we had! I have had some great burgers in my day and Burger Legend did not disappoint. I had The Great One which had their signature bawss sauce, mixed greens, tomato, maple bacon and their single patty.   My burger took quite a while to come.The group was actually finished their burgers by the time I got mine and it was a little dry. I did really like the bun to patty ratio and the bun was soft and fresh.   While I waited for my burger I enjoyed the 3 different fries (poutine, poutine with bacon and regular fries with malt vinegar and ketchup). I definitely enjoyed them!   The great one was 10.10 after tax.   If you are in the streetsville area, definitely give it a try!  It's a small joint but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger place. Very simple but the patty is quite small compared to their bun. Their sauce is quite interesting and toppings very simple. Their Poutine was amazing at first then became very soggy with the fries. Overall pretty good burger joint but definitely had better."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best burger place in town and that's coming from a foodie! The burger is literally perfect, no need to add anything to it it's just great the way it is, the fries are crisp to perfection. I normally hate poutine but i just loveee their poutine and the curd cheese they put in it. I wish they had more locations everywhere so that i could have access to their burgers but then again it's worth the drive to streetsville! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I ended up here by accident as I thought this was a burger priest location.  The restaurant looks a bit sketchy and the staff are a little rough around the edges, but I'm glad I went against what my first impressions were telling me and ordered myself a burger and poutine.  The burger was on par with Burger Priest - very fresh, we'll seasoned, and juicy.  They also gave me a free drink because I sent out a tweet about them.  What did I learn from this experience, never judge a book by its cover..."}
{"text":"It's a good burger and great fries. I love how everything is fresh BUT I hate the maple flavour they add. I'm just not a fan of maple sorry! Decent value for your money ($11-$13) for a combo. Decent atmosphere."}
{"text":"Sometimes you gotta just shake your head.  Went here the other week and ordered a Regular Hamburger for $6 and a North Beach Burger for $10.   What was the difference between the burgers you ask? What ever does one receive when they pay $4 extra you ask? Surely there is a substantial difference between a regular burger and one that costs 66% more.  Well the answer is, the only difference is Guacamole.  Literally 1 spoonful of guac.  LOL.   Awful. For that reason alone it's worth -5*.  The burgers were okay. But I'm a Value Rater.  This place isn't worth your money.   Learn from my mistake.  Don't be a tool."}
{"text":"Went in . Service was great . Ordered final shootout . Top 5 burgers in the city for sure !"}
