{"text":"This didn't start off well.  I asked a question about the menu and the server's answer was to look at me as if I was stupid.  I dared to ask again as his response was vague, and this was met with eye-rolling and a look at the female cashier with a smirk that said, why is this person asking me with questions that I can't be bothered to answer...

However, I trudged on with determination.  I didn't like to see my souvlaki pork stick pulled out of a puddle of murky water, but by then it was too late, I had already paid and just wanted to get out of there.  The food was just okay.

Nuff said about this place except, change the staff."}
{"text":"Its one of the few spots at 10 Dundas I haven't reviewed. The ladies who work here really hustle but seems like there are only two employees here at lunch hour. Standard selection of wraps, gyros, salads and fries, all vaguely \"Mediterranean\"

Decent please for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Opa is one of my favorite fast-food places to visit. It's a great fast-food option for a healthy meal. The chicken gyro with tatziki sauce is amazing. On Sunday they do a special offer; after you place your order the cashier flips a coin and calls heads or tails. If you win you get your meal for a dollar!"}
{"text":"Came here to just grab a quick bite before a movie.  The wrap special ($5.99) seemed ok, got the falafel wrap."}
{"text":"Yeah, seriously, the Greek food getting pumped out of this fast-food joint is pretty darn good. If I'm ever around Eaton Centre on a lunch break, I'll make an effort to pop by this food court just for Opa (and that's with the addition of the Urban Eatery).

Why? I usually order the chicken souvlaki on a pita, and as they fry up the pita on the grill they apply this seasoning salt; I swear there must be crack cocaine laced in there, that shit is tasty. Add in good quality ingredients and copious amounts of tzatziki, and you're in flavour country.

There's some kind of dinner and a movie ticket deal on offer, but I haven't investigated. Could be worth a look if you're heading to AMC for a film."}
{"text":"I am writing this as I just finished my place at opa!

I'm not very happy with my decision to give this place a chance, and I definitely won't be coming back here.

I got a chicken souvlaki plate, minus the bread and rice.  After all... These are just fillers, right? I should know, I'm Greek!  I want substance, not fillers. The two people behind the counter were visibly irritated when I asked for my special request. But they complied, so kudos on them.

My plate consisted of a Greek salad, 2 potato halves (I'm serious) and my chicken souvy.

The salad was not bad... The leaves were fresh and crisp (everyone knows a real Greek salad has no lettuce) , the tomatoes were a bit soggy.  They must have been sitting around in the vinaigrette too long.  The chicken was nice and moist but just 5 small squares on the \"kalamaki\"? I was so disappointed with the serving size. The two small potato halves that I had were flavorful, but just so small. I thought they would have put more considering considering I didn't want bread and rice.

I mean seriously, I can't consider this Greek food at all! Maybe it's my fault, I am in a food court after all, I should have known what I was expecting. 

I'm upset more about the serving size than the actual food.  If u want fillers come here, if u want some real food, I suggest you don't. 

It cost me over 9 dollars (no drink) and I am still hungry, maybe I should hit the Harvey's across from it now."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times and going to the Toronto Life Centre makes an easy food pit-stop for staff when we're all going out together and can't agree on one thing (and don't want to go NEAR the Eaton Centre).

When this place first opened the service was so ridiculously slow that while the food was amazing, you really needed to commit to going here for lunch and using up a full hour-long lunch break. Since then, they've improved the speed of service quite a bit, but considering that the only thing made to order is whatever meat you get, it should be a bit faster.

The calamari lunch plate is amazing, the calamari are perfectly fried and served over their super yummy greek salad (which is more of a veggie mix and is always super fresh tasting, whether its January or August). The bread is sooo good, I'm drooling thinking about it now and I just ate lunch. Whatever they do to it (they grill it and brush it with some kind of yummy goodness) is fantastic and if you get a dinner plate, you get a few wedges of this thrown in. Best part of the meal - but everything else is right up there in terms of taste!

The wraps are very carefully put together and always taste great, they could be a little less stingy with the tzatziki but I like my sauces and can't get enough of that yummy garlicky sauce.

Overall, it's a nice change to the other greek-style fast food places out there where quality is not high up on the list. I've found the food here to be of good quality and while its not the cheapest meal to find in the area (average over $10 including drink), its guaranteed to be good."}
{"text":"Food quality: OK, just OK! I tried the falafel pita and it was kind of dry.

Service: Could be worse  (They mixed up my order with someone else's and had to wait extra time while I starved, just so they can \"warm\" my falafel sandwich.)"}
{"text":"Super delicious food considering its location ( small spot in a very busy food court)

I ordered a wrap with a salad- the wrap was so tasty and the salad was amazing- very filling but also not too heavy 

Overall I was very impressed and will certainly be returning"}
