{"text":"Went for Thursday night trivia tonight. Still waiting for food after ordering an hour ago. Disappointing for a well-designed place."}
{"text":"This morning I am still upset by how I was treated here last night. I was told that I was calling the bartenders inappropriate names, when really I was questioning why they had put charges on my bill. I was told that I was over served and my group was acting horrible and they wanted to kick us all out. This was while others in my group were standing together, talking.  The manager, or that is what he told me he was, I had two different people talking to me saying they were the head manager, is extremely rude and honestly doesn't seem to actually care about his customers. This will be a bar I will never be going to again."}
{"text":"Very cool spot in Madison WI!

Me and crew rolled up here to chill after being out in the sun at a festival in New Glarus. They had a cool deal where you got 2 burgers and fries for the price of one on a Saturday afternoon...very cool. The burger was actually very surprisingly, as usually with a deal like that, the burger is not very good. We enjoyed being up on their rooftop area as it was a good view of other building and good for watching other patrons get drunk and bust their ass LOL. Downstairs they have dart boards in which I am always up for a game. Place really gets rocking when the sun goes down and is a pretty good time. This place made me wish I was back in college because this would have been my place circa 19-22 years old!"}
{"text":"Good place to watch a badger or packer game. Ordered the nachos to eat and definitely not worth the $11"}
{"text":"You'd never think the double u would be known for their Italian food, but let me tell you the lasagna and meatball sub is to die for. Not to mention the valet isn't too bad. Dropped off at the door and kicked to the curb later. Slow Joe should probably be a manager."}
{"text":"0/10 would recommend this evening experience. Was not pleased with the customer service. Probably will return sometime, but not in the near future given recent events."}
{"text":"What the hell did I walk into?  The love of my life's friend was in town (whose son goes to UW) and asked her to meet her there.  Slippery floors.  Girls falling down.  Boys taking jager bomb shots and trying not to vomit.  A thick layer of regret wafting through the place.  This is the Double U at 4:00 pm on gameday.  Second floor outdoor patio was nice as it was a beautiful day but if you want to pump Drake through your soundsystem, it's best to invest in better speakers.  Never would have thought there could be that much distortion coming through a set of speakers.  But let's be honest, most were too drunk to notice.  Nevertheless, we came.  We drank.  The people watching was off the hook."}
{"text":"If you want to hang out in a warehouse, this is your cup of tea. Management is laughable. OVERRATED. Underage? No worries, as long as you're in Greek life you're chances of getting in are 110%."}
{"text":"The building is almost never full enough to permit the insanely long line to get in the bar, usually not worth the wait. Almost never plays good music. Has good deals sometimes especially on Thursdays. Decently spacious and the basketball game is fun. Usually can get served at the bar pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Double U... More like Double the regrettable decisions U will make in a night. Ample space to make poor choices. Snorkels. Stiff drinks (key to my heart). My friend says two thumbs up for double u. She's hot so I would take her opinion seriously"}
{"text":"Listen UP. THESE MOFOS skipped 3 songs in a ROW that I paid for. Then I go up to the bar and what do they do? Nothing. Give me Mariah Carey or give me death!!!! They owe me $3."}
{"text":"There was two girl bartenders on the patio and  when we were first in line to get drink they went to all males first! It was my bachelorette party and my friend said that your bar was super fun but when it takes 10 minutes to get drinks for my party. That is ridiculous when all my party works in the restaurant business and we tip well!!! If I return to your bar I would like to see all your bartenders to respect all patrons of female gender!"}
{"text":"Hmmmmm let me tell you what man¡ dankity dank drank. Love the barbacks. Especially C.E. What a mate¡ chicken fingers to your bum"}
{"text":"Deals galore. Befire heading over, whether day or night, check what deals they are running. Compliment your drinks with some pizza! A personal favorite of mine is Bucky's Pizza. It's topped with grilled chicken and haystack onions. What more can you ask for?! Pro-Tip: Ask for less salt because it tends to come saltier than usual. Also, treat yourself to some loaded Coronas and you're set for the night!"}
{"text":"Awesome staff and drinks! Katie hooked us up with perfect drinks all day and props to the bartenders for making strong drinks!

P.S. Love the rooftop"}
{"text":"Nathan, you were wonderful. So glad to have met you and thank you for being so exceptional! Will be back just because of you!!"}
