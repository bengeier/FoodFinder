{"text":"This is modern Italian cuisine like we have never had before.  We were given the tip to try this place from a friend and I have to say that this gem goes down in my book as a must visit place every time we go to Las Vegas.  It's a bit out of the way for people who visit the strip, but it's well worth the trip.  To start, the restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  It is very modern in design and very tastefully decorated.  From the bartender to the wait staff to the owner himself, the people were great to deal with.  We started with an appetizer combo of Arancini (Risotto balls in a fresh, hand-made tomato sauce) and the Carpaccio (sushi grade yellowfin tuna on an eggplant tart).  Just amazing flavors and as fresh as I have ever had.  The tomato sauce needs to be sold in jars!  We also had pasta that was done 2 ways - fried and boiled, in the same dish with cherry tomatoes and basil.  This was very unique and very tasty.  The Ravioli was absolutely heavenly.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, the cream sauce was delightfully rich and flavorful, and the braised short ribs inside the ravioli were unique and melted in your mouth.  Looking for something familiar but different?  Try the meatball sliders.  Very flavorful, slightly flattened meatballs served on buns with mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce - mini meatball subs!  One of the real unique features of the restaurant was the Enomatic preservation system... basically a 16 foot long machine loaded with bottles of fine wine which you can sample in 1oz, 3oz and 6oz pours at your own convenience.  This is unlike anything we have ever seen before.  Finally, the deserts... I have never been a big fan of Tiramisu.  I find it often too light as a desert and just not rich enough.  This is not the case here.  The Tiramisu at Pips is a must try dish.  If you have never been a fan, their recipe will become your new favorite.  There are no skimping on quality of ingredients in this dish!  All in all, I would have to rate this as one of the finest dining experiences we have ever had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"It's not going to be pretty!  To start off, let me just say that my husband and I know what real Italian food tastes like. My mother-in-law is born and raised Italian (Tuscany region). My husband was raised with home made Italian foods and lived in Europe growing up, in the 80s. We lived in Italy for 3 years, getting plenty of exposure to the food and wines and culture.  On to the review-  First when we ordered our food, our waiter proceded to tell us that the style of the servings sizes is \"Modern European\" because the sizes were small. This is why he kept pushing us to order an appetitizer. We declined, as I was trying hard not to laugh in his face. Modern European? No where did we eat in Italy or anywhere else in our travels was there anything small about our portions. I order the fritti di mare ( I LOVE seafood, esp. fried); my husband ordered the gnocchi with a bleu cheese sauce.  Our food arrives. Oh boy, not good. His \"gnocchi\" looked like short spiral pasta. My fritti di mare was defintely fried to the point of dehydration. We questioned the pasta dish as soon as it hit the table (hence my unawareness of my own dish). The waitress said the pasta was hand made in the kitchen and that a fork was used to give it that spiral look. Sure, we believe you (note the sarcasm). I took two bites out of my food and pushed it aside. Everything was dry. Seafood fried should never be that dehyrated and tough to eat. Also, if it is fried right, there should not be pieces almost completely burnt.My husband proceded to eat more of his dish and still did not like it. We were both unsatisfied.   The owner of the restaurant happened to be on site and he came over to talk to us once he heard the disappointing news. We explained what critics we were about the food. He was shocked that we were not happy. He sits down at our table and we get to talking. Next thing we know, he's called the chef over to our table so we can tell him personally our feelings about the food. First, I explained to the chef the condition of my own dish- much shorter to talk about than the pasta dish.We then explained to the chef what we had expected about the gnocchi dish. The owner said that what we were describing was not gnocchi but the chef said we were right. The chef then told us that the gnocchi he cooks with is flour based (not potato based like it is in most places in Italy) and that it comes from Sardinia (not made in the kitchen, pressed with a fork for the design like the waitress said).    Props to the chef for being honest.   What everyone else was saying did not seem right. The owner is saying one thing and being wrong. Even the waitress was wrong. At least we did not have to pay anything.   We are both very VERY hesitate to eat there again, despite the owner cordialness. However, we would go there to enjoy the wines, which they offer in 1oz, 3oz, and 5oz servings."}
{"text":"Everything at PIPs is AMAZINGLY delicious. The flavor of the food here is very unique. The pasta is made fresh everyday. We had the Carpaccio as an appetizer. The freshness marveled a sushi restaurant. The Mozzarella appetizer was crisp and delicious. And the spicy marinara was the best I've ever had. I had the Tria and gobbled it down like my Thanksgiving dinner the night before. My wife had the Matricana (boars cheek) and we both really enjoyed it. (who would of thought cheek could be so good?) My aunt had the Lasagna which she loved. I loved it too, b/c I ate it for breakfast the next day. My uncle had the Meatball Sliders along with the amazing Rosemary Potatoes. Wow, they were amazing! The owner Rino was very friendly and even brought out his favorite Braised Beef Short Ribs Ravioli. I'm not one to go to normally order ravioli at a fine restaurant, but I will be getting this dish for sure on our next visit. We all couldn't believe how good the ravioli was! MMMM!!! The desserts were great too. We had the Pistachio Creme Brulee. Wow, what a great tasting pistachio dish! And of course we went for the Tiramisu! I loved it so much, I don't think I shared any of it. They had a very extensive wine selection, of which you could taste the wines before purchasing a glass or bottle. The service excellent and attentive. The food was simply amazing! The restaurant was very modern with a warm atmosphere. I can't wait for our next visit to Vegas, which undoubtedly include Pips!"}
{"text":"Okay, here's the bottom line on PIPS - the food is not very good. I would not recommend eating here. The great news is that the wine bar is fantastic!   Pips has a special Enomatic machine where you just go up and serve yourself pours of wine!  They have a selection of about 30 wines from all different regions. Go to the bartender and load money on a special wine tasting card - we find that about $40 will fix a couple up for the entire night!   At the top of the machine are wine glasses - just pick a glass and slide in your card and get a taste of wine. You can purchase a 1 ounce, 3 ounce or 5 ounce pour, and the prices range from about $1.50 - $8 a taste. Your wine tasting card is deducted with each purchase you make.   We love going to the wine bar because it is a great way to try out new wines for not much money. Also on Thursdays, all food and wine in the bar area is half off!"}
{"text":"The portions were small and the flavors were average, while the prices were high.  The service was good and is what warranted the three stars otherwise I would have given it two.  The music lends itself to the bar area, but is not what I would expect in a fine dining environment."}
{"text":"Living in Vegas, I can't BELIEVE people actually think this place is expensive.  What are they smoking??  This place is a bargain compared to its competitors.  They make their own pasta and ice creams-- no other restaurants do this (and do it well) at this price point.  (I think the people that think that Pips is expensive usually frequent establishments like the Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill, so maybe that's why they think it's expensive?)  What I love about Pips is that it highlights Italian cuisine, not Italian-American.  BIG difference.  So don't expect your pasta to be drowning in tomato sauce-- it's about the pasta, not the sauce!  As long as people are prepared for this difference and stay open-minded, they'll love it as much as I do.    The owner Rino's a kick in the pants.  He adds a lot of personality and character and a sense of intimacy to the place and I appreciate that, especially in this town.  I love the radicchio salad, blue cheese gnocchi, chocolate cake adn affogato.  Can't wait to try everything else.  So many other Italian places are carbon copies of each other-- Pips is a refreshing and delicious change of pace."}
