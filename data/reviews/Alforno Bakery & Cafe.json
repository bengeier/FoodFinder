{"text":"I bought some baked goods here as I work close by. It's pricey but it's delicious. The opera cake and peanut butter oat bar were my two favourite items. The ambience is very nice too. I might stay and eat at the cafe next time. I heard their pizzas (or flat breads) are excellent."}
{"text":"Just in this place. Walked up to the coffee bar. Stood there patiently waiting for one of the three employees standing there to acknowledge my existence. Nothing. The one girl couldn't be bothered to say anything to me, too busy making a latte. The, what I assume was the manager, continued to talk to another employee about ordering liquor. No acknowledgement from those two either. Another employee walked up and started chatting with the manager. I decided to speak up and got the smallest of obligatory apologies. But not from the manager or the girl making the latte (the one that should have helped me). I guess if your manager is clueless about customer service your staff will be as well. Don't expect much from this place except frustration."}
{"text":"Nice looking place.  Too bad management doesn't limit the time campers and MacBook users occupy seats.  We left because of no seats and no staff anxious to take our business."}
{"text":"Took my food allergies very seriously which i really appreciated - delicious lunch! will be back"}
{"text":"I came here for a quick bite and coffee. Ended up getting the red velvet cookie and tea. The cookie was good but not spectacular or anything. It wasn't too sweet so if you don't like anything too sweet, this will be suited for you. My friend and I sat on the outdoor patio and it was really nice. The decor was trendy and it looked similar to Vendome which is also part of the Teatro group. I would come back for brunch because we sat next to the table and their food looked bomb."}
{"text":"Review one month ago:  Best cappuccino and almond croissant in town (thank god they dont use Phil & Sebastian). Ambiance is excellent and staff is great. Had a brie and ham sandwich which was amazing because it was on a fresh baked baguette. Yum! Will definitely be back for more!  Review Today:  I have to ammend this review per my experience today. The place was busy and i ordered two cappuccinos to go. The barrista guy had no clue what he was doing. It looked like he was pre-steaming his milk ahead of time. My boyfriend and I recieved two room temperature cappuccinos which had so much milk in them they were lattes at that point. I went back and asked him to remake them...this time they were slightly warmer than room temperature. Either he pre-made his espresso or pre-steamed milk, either way both cappuccinos were bad...again.   I was so excited for this place at the beginning because the coffee at Vendome is exceptional and the barristas take their time! However the barristas here are poorly trained and im sad to see this place succumb to poor quality to meet high demand."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for a long time because I've heard it great. My Vegetable sandwich was really great tasting, but I found it over priced because it didn't come with a side at all. I was still hungry after.  My husband's breakfast egg sandwich was cold in the middle. My son's pancakes were great with a yummy lemon curd on top. Service was a little slow and we waited a long time for something as simple as pre-made sandwich."}
{"text":"Great place. Food is excellent. The place itself is bright and airy. Would totally recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"One day I'll branch out but so far I keep ordering the same thing at Alforno: Garden Benedict. Best part? It comes with a side of salad instead of your same old potato done whatever way. I can fool myself into thinking its a healthy breakfast.  This cafe is perfect for pretty much any situation. Large (ish) groups. If you can snag the tables in the middle, at the top of the stairs., I'd say about 8 people can comfortably eat together.  It also caters to those by themselves or just with a friend. I've seen a dozen couples with kids, and since it's close to the Peace Bridge, you can do take away or sit outside on the loooong wood benches after a bike ride/ run.  Can't wait for the outdoor patio to open.  The only minus is some of the astronomically priced baked goods. 5$ for a pain chocolate?! On the other hand, just in front of the cashier you can find day old items for a mere $ 1.50, and they taste almost as fresh!  This is the kind of place I would bring friends from out to town to impress them.  RAD did an amazing job on the design."}
{"text":"There bakery is really great a bit pricey but at least the baked goods are tasty and worth getting for a treat. There salads are really great for a quick lunch salad. I really enjoyed it and found that some of my friends had loved it as well."}
{"text":"Food quality, value and freshness are the best! Location is awesome in a beautiful and trendy neighborhood. One of my favorite places to dine in Calgary... I would only suggest to add more dishes! Must try..."}
{"text":"Beautiful bakery, cafe, restaurant that appeals to groups, hipsters, families, older folks and couples alike.  Love love love the breakfasts!!!!  Its our regular breakfast spot and the breads are fantastic.  Why would you ever buy grocery store bread again?  Sandwiches are a little too bready for my taste.   Great lunch options too, beet salad is a must try!"}
{"text":"My new daily stop! This cafe is on my walk to work, so curiosity drew me in the first time and both the unbelievable coffee and tasty food keep me coming back. I'd never heard of Paradise Mountain coffee before, but I am converted. It pairs so well with both their baking (those macaroons!) and their lunch menu. I crave the butternut squash soup on a regular basis.   Can't wait to continue to sample their ever-changing selection of baking and make my way trough their menu and wine list! Love!"}
{"text":"Picked up my mom on her lunch break and tried to take her here for lunch... A lineup out the door! We had to come back a different day and it's so cute. Good coffee and baked goods. Excited to come back here for some drink specials and dinners. The space is absolutely inspirational. Feels like a tasteful home with couches and a fire place with a good amount of bar seating, booths and table seating. Great atmosphere, and everything I tried so far has been great as well."}
{"text":"Been for breakfast twice and lunch once, all were great experiences. The food is fresh, delicious and reasonably priced. The service is efficient and tables were cleaned quickly. Too often self serve cafes expect patrons too keep tables cleared and clean, not here. The room is beautiful and bright. This place is a breath of fresh air."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday Brunch. Was told over the phone the wait was about 15 minutes. When we arrived the girl at the front told us she had no idea what the wait would be. They also seated a table that came in after us before us, and it was the same size group. They apologized to us for that because it was an oversight. When it came to ordering it was nice and quick. You ordered and paid and then went to your table. But you have to carry your pastry and coffee to the table yourself. You also have to pour your own water and grab your own napkins and utensils from a side bar. They brought our breakfast to us which I guess was a plus at this point. I ordered the ricotta hotcakes. They were pretty delicious. They were a little oily, but they were good. I also had a pastry that was delicious! Overall the food was good. Would take out pastries but not dine in."}
{"text":"This is a very welcome addition to the local bakery scene in town. This place fills a big hole left by Corbeaux on 17th avenue, which sadly closed its doors. The decor and ambiance reminded me a lot of the old Corbeaux.  However, the place does not receive its merits from any resemblance (whether intentional or not) to what used to be Corbeaux, but definitely has bragging rights of its own. The quality of the coffee is superb, the espresso beverages are diligently crafted, and the baked goods I have tried here (including pain au chocolat, almond croissants, and pain au raisin) are some of the finest I have tried in Calgary and elsewhere.  Extra kudos for the spacious, high-scale feeling, and welcoming atmosphere, and also for the great location  - close to the river walk and in the beautiful Eau Claire district. Perfect to grab a coffee and go for a morning walk along the river."}
{"text":"Sadly I have to update my review (Dec 11, 2017). I attempted to email the Cafe to give them feedback in person but a month later have still not received a response.  A group of 4 of us arrived around 7pm in order to celebrate a friend's birthday. The service we had the opportunity to \"enjoy\" was lacklustre at best. It was clear from the beginning he was not interested in performing his job as waitstaff well. He was consistently confused, mixed up our orders, forgot parts of our order several times, and was extremely disinterested. My friend had to re-order the veg sandwich, along with a glass of wine. Service was quite slow (we ordered a total of 4 drinks, 3 desserts, 1 sandwich - not complicated stuff here). 2 glasses of wine took 10-15 minutes to arrive at our table. The restaurant was not super busy when we were there.  Near the end of our evening we asked for 1 bill to make it easier on him (we weren't sure he could remember who ordered what). We were intending on splitting the bill ourselves. Sadly he was not able to take more than one credit card for the same bill (we have done this so many other places, not sure why you are \"not able to do that here\" according to him). So he had to go and split the bill for us (which took him some time to figure out what each of us ordered). By the time he returned he was very clearly in a bad mood, would not make eye contact, and was generally unpleasant (think silent, brooding). We received no thank you, have a good night, etc.  The only explanation we could come up with is that it was his first night serving. If this is not the case I hope no other customer has had this experience. As one of my friends put it, that was the worst service experience she has had in a long time.   We enjoyed the ambiance (although the restaurant was very cold), the food, etc but won't be returning anytime soon based on the slow, dis-interested service we received.  Previous review (June 30, 2017): Love this cafe! A bit off the beaten path but worth the stop. Great coffee, even better tasty treats. A friend had one of their breakfast burritos and I was jealous!  Very kid and bike friendly - they even have an air pump when you get a flat!"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequently eat at Alforno. Anytime friends visit from out of town, we take them here. The food is great and the coffee is fantastic. It used to be the type of place where you walk in, order and find a seat for yourself. It was part of their charm. They recently changed this style to 'table service' in which you wait to be seated and are served on by staff. This is probably the worst decision they've made. It's not as inviting and the staff seem very confused as to what to say and do. If it weren't for this change I would give 5 stars...6 if I could but this new change makes me not want to come back. It's unfortunate."}
{"text":"I've eaten breakfast and lunch at Alforno. I was extremely happy with the eggs Benedict I ordered the first time, however didn't love the caprese panini. Will return for breakfast though !"}
{"text":"Obsessed with the food here! Can't get enough of there breakfast sandwiches and cream puffs. Love the coffee and always have the best customer service there. The girls there are always so friendly and go above and beyond. Love the one Spanish girl who is always fun to chat to at the coffee station and always gives great make up tips!"}
{"text":"Another little gem by the Teatro group! Similar to their Royale restaurant, the ambiance is set as soon as you walk in the front doors with sunlight streaming through the huge vaulted skylights. Coupled with the minimalistic decor...this space is gorgeous!   We found there to be ample seating around the restaurant, we opted for sitting at the coffee bar so we could watch the barista working his magic.   The latte I ordered was good, made with fresh ground espresso beans, skim milk frothed till hot, and served with a little lump of raw sugar. The only suggestion I have is to make the specialty coffees with 2% milk, not skim unless specifically requested. Maybe that was an oversight, or maybe they had run out of anything other than skim, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.   I also ordered a meringue which was light and crunchy on the outside while soft and gooey in the center. All in all, good!   Although we didn't order any substantial food, the family next to us had ordered lunch and it looked very good. Decent portion sizes and enticed us to try this place again for brunch or lunch next.   I recommend giving them a try. The prices are inline with what the Teatro group usually charges, but from what I could tell the quality is as well."}
{"text":"Alforno is a wonderful place to go in for a cup of tea. They always have excellent service and wonderful dessert. I would also like to recommend the ciabatta olive bread, this is a weekly staple."}
{"text":"While walking the river path we turned up the street and were happy to have run into this bakery, setting is upscale but casual with lots of   Breads and pastries oh my! it's like heaven so fresh!!"}
{"text":"Food and bakery items are hit or miss. Been here twice now for dinner plus dessert and we are a bit meh about it. Service needs to improve and be more efficient. I did like the atmosphere and the design of the place. Location is good for parking."}
{"text":"This cafe looks like it came straight out of Pinterest. It's beautiful inside with accents of white marble and rose gold. There's lot of seating inside and an amazing outdoor patio.   I ordered the carbonara, prosciutto and arugula pizza, and the cream puffs. The bacon in the carbonara was amazing, fatty and salty! I added some pepper to the pasta because the sauce was a little mild. The pizza was just okay to me, but I really liked the dough. Onto the cream puffs, they were so good!! I highly recommend ordering them! I tried the coconut and hazelnut and though both were delicious, the coconut was my favorite.   If you're in town, this spot is perfect to relax and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Simply delicious. Clean restaurant and wonderful kind staff. My first stop in Calgary for brunch and it was the best decision! Recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Desserts are just so so....they don't taste very fresh. Service is not very good, you will oftentimes find cashier empty with no one there to take orders. Drinks are very watery!! Overall, this place is incredibly expensive! I will never go there again"}
{"text":"This is exactly what the area needed - a funky-fresh new café. Great ambiance here ... The space is nice and open, with a clean, chic vibe. The big windows offer a ton of natural light and the high ceilings give it a very luxurious feel. I've been so happy with the salads, pastries and coffee, but was left disappointed with the soup I tried the other day :( It had the flavor of a dirty dish rag and the consistency was thick and chalky...   Also I dig that they offer free water to paying customers (on the left hand side, as you walk in - upper level seating).   I'll be back ... just not for the soup ;)"}
{"text":"What attracted me to this \"cafe\" is its location and building. It's quite big and fancy overall. I came here with a friend around 5 pm and it was an awkward time as they were in the transition from a cafe into a restaurant. Never got that impression as nowhere did it say it turns into a restaurant at night (failure on my part but c'mon). Quite pricey but I was more than happy to see multiple varieties in their baked goods (they are owned by corbeaux bakehouse from what I know.)"}
{"text":"I had a chance to stop by the newly opened bakery in Eau Claire and what a beautiful space! It is an Italian Patisserie that offers a full brunch, lunch and dinner menu, as well as grab and go food/pastries/desserts. Since I was just dropping by, I decided to pick up spinach and ricotta cheese stuffed cannelloni from their grab and go section, and a cheese croissant. Cheese croissants are one of my favorite pastries and I usually judge a bakery based on their croissants, and let me tell you that I was actually kinda of blown away at how good it was! They actually cut the croissant in half and have a layer of cheese in the middle, as well as cheese sprinkled on top. I ate it the next day after I put it in the oven for a few minutes and I was seriously in heaven when I was eating it! The cannelloni was great as well, as good as any other Italian restaurant out there. It looks like their seating area will be a first come first serve type deal, similar to it's sister restaurant Vendome Café. I'm always looking for new places to have brunch so I can't wait to go back and actually have a sit down meal! Looks like they're really trying to promote their restaurant as a great wine bar option in Calgary, as many of their weekly night specials involve wine."}
{"text":"The salad came on a very big plate but was actually small portion. It was very fancy presented and very tasty"}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance and phenomenal presentation.  I recommend you enjoy a mimosa with your Brisket Benny."}
{"text":"the venue looks awesome.  Modern style. Pretty on the outside with kind of espanish/Latino flavor design. Reminds me much of the American west coast restaurants. The food is awesome. I love the hazelnut cream called Paris. Machachino tastes perfect.  Ordered raspberry macaron for 2.50 with a jam filled in.And the ham sandwich is fulfilling."}
{"text":"Nothing goes down quite like a freshly baked good with a freshly brewed cup of coffee. Most baked goods are baked in an oven"}
{"text":"A brand new coffee spot exactly where the city needed one. The location is perfect for when you're walking around the river and need a quick pick me up. Apparently everyone else thinks so too, which is why the lines can get long! But on the plus side, the waiters make sure you get a table as soon as you walk in.  They make delicious lattes and coffees, not to mention the soups and desserts. The butternut squash is a creamy treat with a wonderfully piece of toasted bread and the lemon tart is amazing. Full of citrus and a meringue that's made just right. Also, since this is a bakery, anything that has bread in it is to die for"}
{"text":"I like it! The designer did a great job to keep it upscale but casual. It's very bright and comfortable and it feels like a very open space.  Coffee is great! Pastries are good though a bit overpriced compared to competitors.  Breakfast food is really good too! I'd staff it up at brunch rush hours so the service runs faster. I'd come back"}
{"text":"My friend always brings me a Veggie breakfast sandwich from here and a coffee and all I gotta say is, don't stop what you're doing. The love and care you put into your food definitely shows. I only hope that others that live by your example."}
{"text":"I have never heard of this Italian restaurant before until I came here for a wedding.  What a great discovery!  It was nice for a casual, quaint, and intimate wedding reception.  Atmosphere: 4/5  I really like the casual, intimate atmosphere created by the upstairs area which can be used for a reception in this case or any kind of special meeting / group gathering.  This area can be converted to a dance floor.  Nice natural lighting add to the atmosphere. The downstairs was a nice place for guests to mingle while standing; and the restaurant also has a nice patio outdoors.  The only thing was that the AC got to be a little too cold, and for reception / meetings, it was hard to get a screen / projector in to view slideshows as the band already took the majority of space in the front of the upstairs area.    Food: 4/5  We got to sample the majority of items on the menu including a variety of appetizers, two pastas: the carbonara and risotto, a variety of deserts, and 4 pizzas.  Overall tasted great!  I preferred the carbonara over the risotto as it was a little more flavorful with a slight spicy touch.  For dessert, I liked the tiramisu and chocolate tart.  The pizzas were definitely interesting, using ingredients that I don't come across as often.  For example, the pear was surprisingly good as it added a sweet touch.  I also tried the Yukon but I thought the potato topping and jalapenos were a bit strange for pizza.  The crust is nice, thin and light, which I liked.    Staff: 4/5  overall very accommodating and friendly  Price: 3/5  reasonable  Overall: 4/5  Overall a nice place for a small reception and seems to be fitting for a nice brunch or lunch too.  I like that it is convenient yet tucked away from all the busier streets.  I would love to come back to try some of their breakfast items someday!"}
{"text":"I drove all the way from Airdrie to try this new cafe (and it was worth the drive).  I met a lady who lives in the Eau Claire area and, surprisingly, it was her first time at Alforno too.  We were both impressed with the food and the relaxed but upscale interiors.  The duck confit panino was awesome.  I had it with a cup of coffee and, for dessert, a milk chocolate and lavender cookie.  For its size and the generous duck meat filling, the sandwich could be split between two persons, I think (either that or I had a small appetite that day).  There were so many tempting choices for breakfast alone.  Next time, I will try any of their pasta/wine or pizza/beer specials."}
{"text":"For some reason the owner decided to transform the casual cafe into a restaurant. That's fine if one gets equivalent service. Here it's not the case. I went there yesterday at around 7 pm and there were only 1 sandwich left out of 6 on the menu. If you want a dessert, you need to leave your table go the bar, selected your dessert and bring it yourself to your table to eat it with a plastic fork. Why? Seriously, why?"}
{"text":"Delicious place for sweets. If you're craving sweets and want to try something new this is the place. Yummy in the Tummy. Freshly Brewed coffee is good."}
{"text":"The severs were nice, I enjoyed the carrot cake and my friend had the chocolate cake. We had eaten at model milk prior but due to the flavorless food we came here for dessert. And I'm super happy we did!"}
{"text":"Pretty place with delicious brownies.  Their drinks are lukewarm in temperature so not sure I will go back here for drinks but the pastries yes.  Will try to get more in the future."}
{"text":"Short visit as my friend and I both had a sweet tooth craving. Once we walked in, we noticed the interior was upscale, modern and very spacious.   We ordered a slice of the Opera cake and the chocolate cream puff. The Opera cake was chocolatey, which overpowered the coffee taste. However the chocolate fillings was very smooth which was a nice texture to the cake. My friend really liked the chocolate cream puff which was filled with chocolate mousse.   We enjoyed our dessert outside on the patio because it was sunny. We realized the patio had heaters that was on (which was good because when the wind blew, it was a bit chilly).   This cafe is a great place to go to, offering more than just baked goods (breakfasts, sandwiches, pastas etc.) Overall, I would return to try their other items and enjoy a seating on their upper level."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and I absolutely loved the atmosphere. Always busy with people in and out, and it has a lot of natural light. The coffee is delicious, and today I tried the ricotta hot cakes. They were so tasty, and the portions are very generous. My husband had to finish my plate for me! Even though it's a busy spot, you don't feel rushed to leave. We stayed there for nearly two hours, working on a project, and it was quite comfortable. Definitely looking forward to trying other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"My new favorite bakery! We were only here for lunch but we'll definitely be coming back!  My husband and I shared their soup of the day: cream of mushroom. A large bowl was only $7 and satisfied both our cravings of a creamy soup. My husband also had the ham and brie panino. I ouldnt taste it as he practically inhaled it but he said the bread was just the right crisp on thr outside but soft on thr inside with just the right balance of ham to brie ratio. I had the tart flambe. One of their flatbreads. It was full of flavor! Delish!  And no visit to a bakery is complete without dessert. We got a soft and chewy snicker doodle cookie and a dulce de leche cream puff! It wasn't over the top sweet so it was perfect for our taste buds!  Definitely recommend this place! Will actually be ban tomorrow to test it their dinner selections!"}
{"text":"Newly opened by the Teatro group, I had no doubts that it would be a great place for a bite.  So far I've only had the grilled cheddar and apple sandwich but man, was that ever tasty! The star of the sandwich is actually the bread - soft, chewy and the right amount of crust, hmmmmm! I'm also quite happy you can get their panna cotta and tiramisu - seriously best in the City - to go! Plenty of options to dine in or take away - don't miss them!"}
{"text":"This is an upscale cafe, but I get feeling they have restaurant dreams. The staff are snooty and rude to a point where it is insulting. The food is really delicious but I will never go back because the staff were so snobby.     My friend and I went the one evening because we were craving something sweet. I ordered a cappuccino and some chocolate cake. The lady behind the counter asked if it was to go and I said no, it's to stay. The lady behind the counter then made this dad pouty face as if disappointed and said \"fine\"......um ok. So I told my friend I would go find us a table while she ordered. When my friend sat down she told that the lady told her they don't usually seat people unless it's for dinner. In my opinion we are paying customers and if I want to sit down and enjoy my cake I'm going to do that. So the cakes we ordered came pretty quick but we had to wait forever for our drinks. Finally my cappuccino came but we ended up waiting 20 more minutes for my friends tea. And when it came the waiter just slapped us down on the table so hot water spattered everywhere.  My friend and I were disgusted and we will never be going back."}
{"text":"Alforno is almost clinically clean... it's like a trendy operating theater ... for coffee ... and brunch ... and treats ...   The espresso to go is good.  Very good.  Very.  You'll have to double up in a 12 oz Americano to really savour the tight smoothness of the roast.  That's some fine coffee.  Very fine.  The Carrot Cake is really darn good too.  So good, I forgot to take a picture.  The Ham & Cheese Croissant was so/so, but maybe I should have gotten it heated."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and the food is amazing. I've always found the service slow but generally staff are nice and helpful (and it was worth it for the food).   I just went in for a Sunday coffee and breakfast sandwich. I was seated upstairs and after 15 minutes, not one person came to ask me if I wanted to order any food, coffee or even to offer water. I spoke to the manager and while he apologized, I noted that lots of people came in after me and they were offered service. I bring my colleagues and team here, buy desserts for work and other items from here. That stops today. So disappointed. That was a new level."}
{"text":"I was in Calgary for the week again, and decided to try a couple different coffee places near the hotel I was staying at.  Alforno was a short walking distance away, and it was open later than other places nearby - perfect!  Since it was in the evening, I ordered a double-shot soy decaf latte, and a nutella croissant.  I had to wait quite a while for my coffee, even though there was just 2 guys who'd ordered a while before me standing there.  I waited patiently, and watched the guy make my coffee.  I left and walked around downtown.  When it was cool enough to drink, I tasted the coffee, and it was the worst coffee I've ever had in my life.  It was extremely burnt tasting.  Like maybe it had been sitting for hours?  I don't know, or maybe that's what this place thinks is good coffee (there's a place in Anchorage that consistently over-roasts their beans and tastes burnt more often than not).  Anyway, I tried to make it through a couple more sips, and ended up trashing it.    I ate half of the nutella coissant.  While flakey, it was quite dry, approaching that 'day old' texture.  It did have good flavor, but after the unacceptable coffee experience, and so many other options, I'd rather take my business elswhere."}
{"text":"This place offers some good options but in my few visits, I have seen from very high-class food to below average breads. Needs to work on consistency and recipes."}
{"text":"Alforno is an upscale cafe and looks very fancy as soon as you enter with its high ceilings and big bright windows. You order your food and drinks at the counter but it is served at the table. We tried a couple of the cakes, a matcha latte, a cappuccino and an iced americano and we were generally satisfied with the drinks. I especially loved the cappuccino as it was strong and flavorful.  The cakes on the other hand were a little disappointing. We tried the matcha citrus cake and the mango blueberry cheesecake; the flavours did not blend together very well and some bites were sweet while others were sour.  Their presentation is obviously top notch and if that is something that you appreciate, this is the place for you. The staff was nice and courteous but not particularly welcoming."}
{"text":"Happy Valentine's Day ........ Came here for brunch with my lovely. Food is fresh and delicious. They serve a wide variety of sandwiches, baked goods and regular breakfast options.   We ordered the open face Sammy and the ricotta hot cakes. The hot cakes were so yummy with a nice sweet berry jam on the bottom. If you have a sweet tooth this was the perfect choice. My boyfriend had the open face Sammy which was a bit too heavy for him. But it did look really good.   The price is reasonable for the two meals with a coffee and tea it cost about $35. The servers are friendly and kept the tables clean. Lots of seating.   Definitely will return to try there pastries. The cream puff was the size of a baseball!"}
{"text":"Great Italian Restaurant and coffee place near the Prince Island Park. I mostly come here for coffe either myself or with friends. If you want a quiet place, chose Alforno."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place and the baked goods are deeeelicious. Lots of seating which I like, but I would say it's pretty over priced for what you get. Coffee wise I'd honestly just choose Starbucks but that's obviously personal preference. Regardless it is a good treat every now and then."}
{"text":"Planned to find a quick breakfast spot on the way out to Banff, and while yelping options my fiancé  said lets go ahead and try the new place next to our old condo that you have been wanting to try. So we went, and while he parked, I went in to get a table, however I was met by quite a long line and that was just to place an order; so I knew he wouldn't want to wait. Well needless to say, he didn't, but by then I was sold, not just on the looks of the place alone but also by the comments I was hearing from others that where in line that had been there already. So, I won!!! OK, well kind of, because of the of the wait, he said if we do stay, we will need to just grab a breakfast sandwich to go; thwarting my idea of trying either the Eggs Benedict or the French Toast that both looked so amazing as I saw plates go by.... So we both ordered the Bacon and Egg Panini, (they are big enough to consider sharing) which turned out to be a great decision! After savoring the sandwiches, we both agreed hands down, it was the best breakfast sandwich we had ever eaten! The farm fresh eggs and bacon were cooked to perfection and served on amazing bread! We will be back. Love the vibe and cool decor!! P.S. I guess technically we both won, didn't we!"}
{"text":"Disappointing bakery items at a high price with empty displays.  Something isn't quite right."}
{"text":"Such a cute little cafe/bakery! I LOVED the hazelnut cake and my husband thoroughly enjoyed his peanut butter cookie. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I feel it is too pricey."}
{"text":"Alforno is delicious! Got the eggs Benny and it came with a beautiful salad which is a nice change from your everyday hash browns. Fast service and very nice inside!"}
{"text":"too pricey for the same fair you get at many other places.  Nothing extremely unique that denotes a heavy pricetag besides location"}
{"text":"I like coming here and enjoying a latte as I get some work done on my laptop. It is a lovely spot with a clean and cozy vibe. Alforno's is still fairly new so it tends to get a little crowded, but I like the way they handle the flow of people when it is busy. No need to worry if there is a line because when you arrive an employee will reserve a table for those dinning in. The noise level tends to be louder than other coffee shops, but sometimes I welcome the happy chatter and other times a pair of headphones will do the trick. The food is on par with the coffee, and the coffee is wonderful! If you have a chance to stop by it will be well worth your time."}
{"text":"Was initially a little skeptical to visit this cafe after reading a few negative reviews. My fiancé decided to take a chance to see how it would go since the exterior looks too cute to miss out. And, I'm glad we did! First, not sure how service can be that bad when it is practically a self-served cafe, like most. You make your order up front, find your seat (plenty of seatings), and they bring your coffee and/ food out. They've got an area with cups, water, milk, silverware, napkins, etc for you to grab whenever or whatever you need.  Coffee- was good!  Pastry/baked goods- excellent! At least with the cream puffs I ordered. Not too sweet or heavy Food- was ok. Presentation was decent. Overall, cute place to hang out."}
{"text":"So far it's the best cafe I've tried in Calgary, would give 5 star if the line moved faster, I think I waited 15 minutes to order the last time I was there. But hey, what can you do if you love the decor, food, and space."}
{"text":"This venu and decor is one of the nicest I've seen. Such a cute cafe!! I went later in the afternoon and there sandwiches were all sold out, which was too bad since they sounded delicious. So I got a margarita pizza and a mocha. The drink was fantastic! The pizza was pretty standard, but good. The atmosphere and the decor were definitely my favourite part of the experience. I can't wait to go back and try the breakfast next time. I very highly suggest checking out this trendy and classy location."}
{"text":"I like it here! I've been a couple times. Super delicious desserts and hot drinks. Wouldn't recommend the pasta nights, very buttery and hard on the stomach.  There's a warm fireplace and looks super clean and modern. Super basic girl place. Would recommend for a coffee date but it gets a bit loud and not a lot of places to sit during busy times."}
{"text":"We came early on a weekday as it tends to get really busy during the lunch hour. I ordered a panzella salad but it was soaked in dressing. I sent it back and they were really friendly to correct my order which came out really quick. You order at the front and they deliver the food to your table based on a ticket system and drinks are self serve. Come early if you want a seat. I'd come here again to try some of their sandwiches which were all made on artisan bread."}
{"text":"Used Yelp for the first time to find a dessert shop nearby central Calgary. Fortunately found this gem in Eau Claire! Ordered the Opera cake, pistachio macaron, and dairy- and gluten-free vegan chocolate tart with a latte and London fog to drink. The tart was dense and creamy, the Opera cake was light, crispy with a delightful coffee finish, and the macaron was crisp yet moist. Open til 9pm nightly with ample spaces to relax on a date or if you wanted to get some homework done."}
{"text":"I REALLY like Alforno, the place has a great design and the patio is adorable, I like the multi level seating and variety of table spaces. The fireplace upstairs is so cozy, it feels like you're in a really chic living room. The bike on the wall over the coffee station also gets a thumbs up from me - it makes for a great Instagram haha   My only qualm with Alforno is it can take a little while to order, you need to line up and order first then take your number to your seat and I find it can take a little while to get to the till to order, with that said though I have always gotten a seat. Maybe the irresistible pastries make me extra impatient.   Alforno has brunch, lunch and dinner options on their menu along with a wide assortment of pastries, baked goods and drink options. I've tried the pasta and thought it was excellent, so fresh and full of flavour! Their brunch options are also delicious, I really like sweet breakfast options and their french toast and pancakes are down right decadent, large portions and super filling! They also serve great lattes and you have to try a baked good or pastry, I often order a pastry to go and bring it home with me after my meal there."}
{"text":"5 star for decor. 4.5 for food and Dessert. 2 for the service. So overall I can only give it a 3. If anybody who does not have patience waiting in line for busy hours, please go there on weekdays. It will be more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Excellent food,  great ambiance,  but slow, no, very slow service. Maybe it's all expected,  since by the time we finally ordered, our table was ready, but we were hungry and tired and it was a little infuriating... But it all worked out well in the end,  with great food."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend. We walked in around one pm, the line told me this place was popular :). The pastry case looked fabulous, the Sandwich case looked empty. My wife and I sat down after ordering a few items: the lemon tart was very sweet, which to me means it was delicious. The vegetarian breakfast sandwich was wholly average and, for 11 dollars, wasn't worth it. The Americano was a nice strong  drink and my wife enjoyed her \"London Fog\".  The atmosphere is very trendy, slick, but I did notice some staff slowness, five uncleared tables on the patio as we were looking for a place to sit. Everything considered, I think it was an average experience, at least for us on that day. Maybe you will have a better experience :)"}
{"text":"I dined here last Friday night. After being here numerous times for lunch, I was completely surprised and disappointed by the poor overall dining experience - from the bar, to inexperienced wait staff to poor food preparation. I had to check the website to make sure the restaurant hadn't been sold.   After being seated, it went down hill. Delays with menus, after ordering drinks we were told 20 minutes later that the bar had run out of Aperol. Our appetizer order got mixed up. A simple question about the special soup came back with the name of the soup and no description???  It goes on...  Observations:  1. Wait staff all seemed new, and inexperienced. No ability to describe or recommend anything on the menu. Confusion as to what table was getting food. Why offer table service in the evening if your staff are incapable of handling it?  2. Food flavours were 'off' - calamari extra spicy and then Yukon Potato pizza was tasteless and poorly assembled  3. Big gaps in service. Dirty dishes. Uneven attention -- who was our server??  Hugely disappointed. Don't bother opening in the evenings if you can't manage table service. After this, we can't recommend your restaurant.  Update: I posted this review after waiting for the restaurant to respond to my email. I then called the restaurant and left a message. Still no response. I was hoping that they would try to address the situation. Honestly, it would have been more productive to address the problems that night but we couldn't wait to leave and the staff seemed incapable of answering basic questions, let alone addressing the poor service."}
{"text":"Walking in, my first impression was: Wow.   The interior design was sleek, modern and chic. It was done in a fashion that made the place seem open and roomy (which was great considering the amount of people that were there!)   One thing that I should mention is that they have somewhat of a confusing seating system. Apparently, you're suppose to place your order at the counter, but while you're waiting in line, a server would come up to you to ask you if you were dining in. If so, they would go and reserve the next available table for you on your behalf. So, it wasn't like a typical cafe with open seating and it wasn't like a restaurant either. Unfortunately, this did cause some confusion for some, so I only hope that they can come up with a system that is a bit more straightforward.   On to the food.   They had a large selection of pastries, cakes, breads, and sandwiches, all of which were presented beautifully in their display case. But I went for their Gravlax Eggs Benedict and a small soy latte. The Benedict was presented stunningly (as was the latte), however to my disappointment, the poached eggs were closer to being hard boiled! Furthermore, my $4, 8oz latte tasted incredibly bitter and strong. I typically enjoy my coffee with a full bodied flavour, but this tastes as though I was drinking a pure shot!  I don't know if I came on a day where they were too busy or stressed to properly execute their food, but I expected so much more!"}
{"text":"The vibe is just right with this place. Airy, bright and classy, with minimalistic (yet cozy) decor. There are plenty of seating options, including a covered outdoor patio.   We ordered the cheese platter, funghi pizza, cappuccino and triple berry cheesecake. Overall, I thought the food was great. Cheesecake=heavenly.  The pizza was a bit on the salty side, however.   I'm already looking forward to my next visit here. They have daily food and drink specials, as well as brunch. I think the atmosphere is what really sells this place. It's perfect for a date night, especially because it's a short walk to the riverfront, or for a girl's night."}
{"text":"Cozy, casual place for a nice dinner paired with wine. Really enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Had coffee here. Great atmosphere. Great selection of baked goods. Very weak shaw wifi signal but worth the  visit all the way out west downtown.  Treats that were super enticing for next time are one giant creme puff or a earl grey coffee cake in the shape of a volcano.  Only complaints is that they messed up our latte and didn't bring it to us until we expedited them. Otherwise super cool atmosphere and great place to chat and meet friends. Coffee was delicious too."}
{"text":"Brought to you by the Teatro Group, Alforno Bakery is the latest addition to their growing family.  Tucked away on the quieter side of downtown, Alforno Bakery can be seen as a new white building (don't forget those golden doors!) that can be found near the peace bridge. Although I've been here 3 times already, each time was just to grab something small so I could sit around and have a conversation with a friend, therefore I can't give a proper review of their meals. Having said that though, I have tried their blueberry cream puff (delicious!), an orange-almond cake (super soft and flavourful), and their half-price bottle of wine accompanied with a cheese platter (served with a variety of house made bread. I'm a total carb person so this was absolute love!).  Despite having visited a few times already, I still can't get enough of their gorgeous space. It is so beautiful and provides a very relaxing environment to be in. I love that it isn't super busy when I come, because the noise level is low enough for me to share conversation with a friend, nor is it eerily quiet. It's just a perfect spot to hit up if you're looking for some dessert after dinner, or after work drinks.  Service is bit more difficult to review because it's been different each time. One thing I noticed is that even though I come when it's not too busy, there are always several tables that are left uncleaned, leaving less seating options available.  My friend and I arrived a few minutes short of 5pm and wanted to order the cheese platter from their small plates menu. We were informed by the young male server at the till that we weren't allowed to order off of the small plates menu until 5pm (it was 4:57pm), but luckily he made an 'exception' for us. He also seemed unaware of the half price off bottles of wine special that happens on Wednesdays, as my friend had to remind him when he was entering the item into the till. Although he seemed rather new to the industry, he was very pleasant and friendly. He came by a few times to make sure we were doing fine and offered to place our wine bottle in a cooling canister.  I'm definitely looking forward to coming back to try out their meals, especially their sandwiches because they look amazing!"}
{"text":"too expensive for what it is. the building is nice & the staff were friendly but the prices were far too high for what was received."}
{"text":"K, so in my mind, this place has lost their focus for baked goodies. They've gotten rid of most of their decadent stuff and replaced it with croissant-type stuff, which I haven't tried yet. However, I went here for a full lunch and it was awesome! The Prosciutto and arugula pizza is really good - crispy crust, lots of quality toppings. And Thursday is $12 pizza day! yay!  They also have discounted wine that day, too. I've seen few drool-worthy sandwiches there that I've been meaning to try - high quality bread/buns with cheeses and meats that are grilled to order (I believe).  Also, my friend ordered their butternut squash soup that came in a bathtub-sized bowl and was super creamy, so one of these days I've gotta order that, too."}
{"text":"I've been to Alforno twice now, and I can't stop being blown away by the ambiance. the open concept space looks so incredibly hip, I feel like I'm in San Fran or Seattle. It's a order at the till and take a seat concept - which is fine, except for the part where lines can be literally out the door. Even after you order, there may not be a table - so be careful you don't find yourself without a spot to sit and have your order arrive.....  I've tried the hot cakes, the smoked salmon benny, and the duck sandwich here. I find in general one portion of any of these items isn't enough to be filling for brunch - that may just be the over-eater in me talking, though. The Hot cakes (pancakes, with syrup and berry compote), fantastic. Fluffy, buttery, sweet - what a treat, doesn't taste like pancake mix at all! The smoked salmon benny - as good as anywhere, so no complaints. Finally, I had heard some amazing things about the duck confit sandwich, so I had to try it.   First of all, the sandwich thing at Alforno is a little confusing. They seem to prestock their sandwiches in the case rather than making them fresh, and once they sell out of a sandwich from the case, that's it for the day - which is so unusual because it's not like these sandwiches are difficult to make.   Secondly, I found that maybe because it had been sitting in a display case all morning, the duck was partially dried out. The bread was fine as the whole thing had been retoasted, but I also found that the sandwich was very sparse on the \"Truffle Aioli\" it's supposed to have - I could barely taste it. Finally, it was served plain with no garnish, which I find to be unimaginative and something that has a very very easy and quick fix. It tasted okay, but not any different from any other toasted sandwich anywhere else, and thus I really expected better.   Because this is such a great, attractive spot I'll definitely come again for brunch or dinner, as I do want to try their pasta menu too, but for the time being I plan on steering way from the sandwich case!"}
{"text":"Came here because they're open later than most bakery-type places in downtown so we thought we'd try it out. The first thing I think is weird is that it seems like they're torn between being a restaurant and a cafe. If you order food, you're served like a restaurant but if you order baked goods or coffee, you get a number to take to your table where they come serve you.   Coffee: I got a normal latte to drink. The coffee was pretty strong which I personally liked, but I can see how it's not for everyone. Our drinks came very spaced out from one another, timing-wise. One of them also came in a to-go cup but the others to stay??   Food: I got a slice of the chocolate cheesecake which was DELICIOUS (though pricey). My friend got a cinammon bun, which was served cold and was HARD AS ROCK.   Service: Meh, everyone seemed pretty disinterested. Maybe because it was later in the day (8 pm) but still a bit off-putting  Overall, it seems pretty hit or miss at Alforno. I'd probably go back if in the area, but maybe just for a coffee to go."}
{"text":"We grabbed a couple desserts to go and it was nice because this bakery was open much later than the others in the city.  We tried the red velvet cake (a little bit on the dry side),  salted caramel cheesecake (lighter cheesecake which was good) and our favourite was the chocolate ganache tart.   We also tried the matcha and nutella macaron and they were okay.  Went again for dinner to try out the food.  The restaurant does have a wonderful ambiance. Everything was just okay. The best dish was the carbonara but even then it was just okay. I would only come back for desserts or wine."}
{"text":"Eau Claire is a more interesting place just because of this new place!  Excellent service, lovely ambience, great prices. What else can I ask for?"}
{"text":"We just hosted our son's engagement party here and it was an amazing venue. Andrew worked with us to put together the menu and the food  served that night was delicious. From the appies to the pizza served later in the evening, the desserts were a culinary masterpiece. Everyone of our guests raved about the menu and were so taken by the atmosphere in the restaurant. There will definitely be new clientele coming in after this. Alysha, the manager that evening was very helpful and accommodating. All the servers that evening continually were making rounds passing appies. There was no shortage of food. The venue itself was the perfect size. We were given free reign to decorate as we wished but didn't really need to add much. The bar area was perfect for mingling. The patio was nice to have at the beginning of the event to be able to sit at and enjoy quiet conversations. The fireplace was a hit with my parents, it was nice and cozy for them. Later in the evening the upper area was converted to a dance floor and we danced the night away. We wanted to serve feature drinks at the party, and let us tell you...despite not having whiskey sours on the Alforno drink menu, Andrew's recipe for a whiskey sour was the best one we have had yet. Even my 89 year old father enjoyed it. Thank you to Andrew and the staff at Alforno for making our event a success."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place. Came here thinking of desserts and when I walked in, I found out I was wrong. I realized that this place is more of a soup and sandwich place. So instead I got the butternut squash soup. The soup came with a piece of herb toast and it was really good.   The soup is definitely homemade. I loved it.   The décor is interesting. Its sun roof is interesting. Looks like there are bats up there. Only issue is that its in a residential neighborhood so can be an issue in the winter time.   This place is interesting."}
{"text":"It was hard to rate this place because the appearance and atmosphere of the space are one thing and the taste of the food is another. The space is VERY appealing to the eye! It's very spacious and so clean and unique. I could sit there for hours feeling comfortable and happy.   The dessert and bakery displays are filled with unique and amazing desserts! This definitely saves this place because the food we had was very disappointing. We got there around 11:10 and wanted to get pizza for lunch but unfortunately they couldn't make it until 11:30. We didn't understand the purpose for that but decided we would wait until then to order. I ordered the butternut squash soup to start and it looked pretty but that's about it. It was very bland and I didn't even most of it. We ordered the Bianca pizza to share which had almost no cheese! Two of the slices were completely crust. We did like the hint of honey that was added to it and it had potential to be very good if only it had cheese. The Nutella croissant was the only good thing we had. We didn't get to try drinks but the menu looked like it had a good variety.   The place gets super packed weekdays around noon so beware! There is enough parking on the street when the place isn't packed.   Overall 5 stars for dessert and appearance but 2 for the food. The place wasn't even crowded when we ordered so I'm not sure what the excuse is for the mediocre food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, lovely food, and tasteful interior design. Definitely a nice place for a lady date or summer afternoon glass of wine!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Love the space, bread is fantastic:) Teatro group does another great place!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. I was extremely excited to try this place as the decor and how open it is gives off a good vibe. We came in for brunch and they told us there would be a 15 minute minute wait so we decided to sit up at the bar. Terrible decision.   The coffee station was complete filth. The milk jugs were disgusting, there were grinds everywhere and the steam wand hadn't been wiped in so long that there was a thick layer of milk stuck to it. When the individual in the bar area wasn't making a drink he would just stand there and eat his carrot cake instead of cleaning up the horrendous mess. Once seated we ordered a coffee as we were curious as to how the beans would taste  which was not bad at all except the fact that both mine and my friends cups were dirty. When our coffee was delivered the girl didn't even know which one was the almond latte and which one was the regular latte.   The food was decent, nothing special and unique, and a little bland. Lemon curd on my waffle was amazing but there wasn't enough liquid on it so it was a tad bit dry.   We had asked for our bill and were paying half in cash and half on debit. The server had the audacity to mention that only the amount that we were paying on the machine is what  the percentage for the tip amount would be. Desperate much? I will never come back as the service and lack of cleanliness is disturbing in a place that's so overpriced you would think they would be more welcoming and clean."}
{"text":"Good food, fast and friendly service. Can get a bit noisy but all in all a good experience."}
{"text":"Superb when it's superb, mediocre when it's not which is rarely but often enough that I'm compelled to take a star off. The baked things are usually amazing. The coffee looks better than it tastes as they've gone the bizarre route of using paradise roasters, which is far too dark."}
{"text":"I haven't really been anywhere around this area of Calgary. I think Alforno is new(ish). My girlfriend brought me here for coffee. We had the chocolate mouse pies which were delicious. I was so happy with them. I had a london fog latte which tasted pretty standard! So I really have no complaints. My friend also tried the butternut squash soup, she said it was good but needed a little salt and pepper. :)  I think the layout and decor of this place is absolutely beautiful. I saw a lot of people here relaxing with their homework or a friend. It was busy even though it was raining outside.  I would definitely come back here. Its a little bit off the beaten path (for downtown), so hopefully I remember!"}
{"text":"Ok ok ok ok .... this review is solely on the desserts. So, I follow their instagram prrrretty closely and I've been waiting for the day I was able to visit because DROOOL.  My sister is in town visiting so I took a couple days off to spend time with her which gave me the opportunity to visit Alforno with my sisters!  It was a Tuesday afternoon around 12:30pm when we decided to hit up Alforno.  Alforno is situated in the heart of Eau Claire on 7th Street SW.  Parking is available on the street, but only for 30 minutes before you have to pay. I knew we were just going in for dessert so it was perfect for us. Upon entering, I quickly notice that there was a line, lunch seems to be a busy hour for them. At the front, there is a beautiful display of sandwiches to the left and house-made freshly baked pastries, bread and cakes to the right...HEAVEN!!! I got out of line and excitedly walked right up to the display, of course took a couple snaps and admired the desserts.  I knew that I wanted to try the famous cream puff because of their photos on instagram - there were 3 on display, chocolate, dulce de leche, and blueberry. I couldn't decided so I got the blueberry 'to go' and a dulce de leche to stay. My younger sister decided to go with the stunning strawberry vanilla layer cake and my older sister went with the caramel cheesecake with cookie bottom crust. Our desserts were quickly plated and we went over to the neat taps under the bike to get some water. I also noticed there is a \"Takeaway\" display, where you can find, kombucha, cru juice and other beverages.  My older sister absolutely loved the décor, bright, spacious, hipster-like.  You can either sit on the main or walk up the stairs to more seating.  We sat upstairs and took millions of photos of our desserts before we forked in. We shared all desserts. I took a bite of the cheesecake, yum! It was silky smooth with a crispy crunch cookie bottom. The caramel on top was a nice touch. Moving onto the cream puff, I took the top of the cream puff and dipped it into the cream and it was nice and light. They are quite generous with the filling, so that's a bonus and the texture of the puff is interesting, I wonder how they do it?! Then to the Strawberry vanilla cake - this was disappointing. For how pretty it looked, the taste didn't measure up. The cake had a mild lemon hint and it was good but the pink outer icing wasn't very good and there was too much of it. Normally I LOVE LOVE LOVE icing but the icing ratio to cake was too much and it literally tasted like hard butter. You know how some places have a nice smoooooth buttercream? This wasn't it. *see picture* so if they changed it to a smoother icing, I would eat it ALL up! It was just disappointing how inedible the outside was.   Out of all the desserts, we all agreed that the cheesecake was the favorite. I did hype the cream puff and told my sister how delicious it looked and how everyone was raving about it but she didn't think it was anything special -\"Its just a cream puff\" she said and she was right, nothing crazy special about the cream puffs, they're just big and have a lot of filling. After we left, I decided I wanted to try the blueberry cream puff we took to go and I was pleasantly surprised. The cream inside tastes a bit like a light light cheesecake cream and it was filled with blueberries within the cream, it was really really good so it quickly became my favorite. My sisters thought it was really good too, much better than the dulce de leche.  It's the cheesecake tasting cream and blueberry filling that made it stand out.  Alforno offers higher but reasonable prices, beautiful décor and desserts. I think Alforno would be a great first date or a place you want to just sit and study or surf the net. I will likely be back to try other desserts and maybe try some entrees, but won't be in a rush."}
{"text":"This is the old señor frogs location and it's been transformed into a fresh and hype space! Hot off the press this morning was the garden eggs Benny which has its own unique twist being served on two pieces of grilled bread. Every ingredient in this dish was extremely fresh and packed a punch of flavour. If you order a coffee of any sort step up to add your dairy poison to it all on tap! Can't wait to go back on any other day which always features a smoking deal such as Thursday's - margarita pizza and glass of beer or wine for 15 bucks"}
{"text":"There was a long wait and the wait was slow, but that could be because it was Mother's Day. Nonetheless the servers were extremely friendly, giving us complimentary coffee while we waited, some of those most friendly and knowledgable staff I've ever seen.  My dish Gravlax Eggs Benedict was late but worth the wait! Superb! Duck confit, porcheta  and vegetable sandwiches were the best I've had!!! Coffee is typical Calgarian coffee. Weak.  Desserts were really decadent!  This is a new favorite place! Come and try!"}
{"text":"This is r fav brunch datdle place.. love the eggs benedicts the lemon raspberries cake n omg the coffee kis outstanding..."}
{"text":"I was in Calgary last week and stopped here for brunch. I had the Canadian ham eggs benny. The Hollandaise sauce was really good but the rest was only OK and didn't really stand out.   Service was friendly however, there were a lot of bodies moving around but not a lot of efficiency. I noticed the server forgetting a few things on other tables and he had forgotten to bring me the hot sauce I requested. He was very apologetic though.  The outdoor patio is a great little space with nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place, reminds me of a café in Paris. Great food, great treats, love the location and atmosphere. This is a winner!"}
{"text":"A delightful experience.  Good pastry's and coffee. Cool hang out place. Felt a little out of place in an all white person store and getting lots of looks. But didn't feel threatened more like being observed like a zoo animal.   I would return here or try another bakery too."}
{"text":"Lovely brunch on a chilly weekday morning. Ordered at the counter and found a cozy spot in the second floor to settle in. The interiors were a bright, airy Scandinavian style with some comfy seating options and a fireplace! Loved the generous daylight in the space afforded by the glass roof.   Eggs Benedict - veggie ($14) was delicious and super filling. Poached eggs were cooked just right and the ratatouille and salad were flavourful but not overly seasoned. The in-house bread was fresh out of the oven and pretty tasty as well. Service was fast and friendly. Would love to come back and try dinner"}
{"text":"This is my favourite cafe in Calgary. It's perfect for a quick coffee stop, a calm relax time with baked goods, and also for a full meal. This cafe is so multifaceted each providing a great experience. And every staff member is so kind and helpful."}
{"text":"Items Ordered: Gluten Free Vanilla Rum Raisin Cake Almond Croissant Banana Cornflake Muffin Blueberry Clafoutis Pear Frangipane Tart Snickerdoodle Quinoa Oatmeal Raisin Cookie  Recently opened by a longstanding local Restaurant Group, the highly polished space greeting wealthy Eau Claire residents with a fireplace for lounging and table service for breakfast, lunch, dinner or pastries, Alforno Bakery & Café purports a focus on nothing but the finest ingredients, though the actual execution reminisces more of the \"Quick Casual\" Panera with a touch more refinement, plus a license to serve Beer and Wine.  No doubt a spacious and pleasant environment, a small market of locally produced goods and grab n' go options located right when facing glass cases filled with temptation, those arriving at Alforno early are greeted by shelves yet to be fully stocked plus a brief menu, the Ricotta Pancakes apparently quite popular, though the focus of this visit was entirely on the bakery.  Finding service to be low on enthusiasm...or Coffee...the young lady behind the counter's flattened affect a rarity in the forty Alberta eateries visited during my stay, it was after some perusal that a total of seven items were selected, some of them already bagged and prepackaged including a kitchen sponge-reminiscent Vanilla Rum Raisin Cake that reaffirmed fears of gluten-free baking.  Surprising finding not a single option still warm, the overly-firm Clafoutis actually still icebox cold, better bites were found in the flaky Pear Tart with sweet Almond Paste, thought the twice-baked Croissant lightly smeared with the same came across flaccid, the exterior nicely baked but the inside neither springy nor open.  Next turning attention to a Muffin followed by two Cookies, the former well-conceived with a small stump and the top shellacked with crunchy Cornflakes over moist Banana Bread, the Cookies were a bit more hit and miss as the sugary Snickerdoodle was light in Cinnamon and a bit drier than expected while the Quinoa Oatmeal Raisin round was thankfully not over sweetened, but chewy in a way that is 'interesting' rather than pleasant."}
{"text":"This is my first stop into this spot and boy, am I disappointed.  I was invited to meet a friend down here for breakfast.  Granted, it was my fault due to traffic I arrived a bit late (11:10am) and was curtly told by the gal behind the counter that there was no breakfast available after 11.  My friend being super flexible suggested we order a pizza, and the girl replied - sorry pizza is not available until 11:30.  You can't have that for 20minutes more... Ok, well then... What can we order? She suggested a sandwich or a pastry.  and when we asked for a suggestion with more protein options, the reply was \"We are a 'carb-centric' restaurant. We ended deciding to order lattes - which were fairly 'foam-centric' and not made with care at all.  After this lovely experience my friend and I decided we wouldn't order any food and most likely wouldn't be back at all.    I really don't know why they are so busy, maybe because of the lovely patio or the pretty design that barely made up for a mediocre coffee at $5 a pop, a hipster run establishment that could care less what customer experience is, and pastries that are outrageously priced. Unless you want to spend a lot of $ go elsewhere.  In Calgary with the choices that there are, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, good food, great ambiance and decor, good service, what else could you ask for. Maybe a larger selection of brunch and possibly a more streamlined method of delivering food/drinks. Breakfast usually runs until 11 on weekdays and later on the weekends, unfortunately I came in on a weekday and was unable to get to try the brunch.   We ended up getting the Tuesday special which was pasta and a glass of wine for $15, such a steal! We got the bucatini carbonara and the lasagna (FYI the deal is only on the $15 pastas). The pasta was hearty and full of cheezzy goodness and pretty sizeable portions. We also got to try the matcha latte, can I say delicious and just the right amount of matcha.  I will definitely coming back to try the brunch/breakfast menu and enjoy the great atmosphere especially outside on the patio. Happy munching!"}
{"text":"I have been there for breakfast and for drinks: The breakfast sandwich is great! The latte coffee is ok... Was not terrible but nothing amazing... The sangria was very good. In general I like this place, the ambience and the location ..."}
{"text":"Really great food and coffees.  Kind of pricy, but service is fast and everything has always tasted great."}
{"text":"I like the open view and a warm and welcome atmosphere. A really nice place to chat with friends and enjoy a good tea time."}
{"text":"Lovely decor. Love the variety of seating and natural light that comes through the skylights. Got the matcha latte which was way too sweet for my liking. The spiced apple cake started out good but the sweetness was just too cloying and I could not finish the whole piece.  I had it packed up at the counter by the wet tongs that have probably been sitting there since the morning.  The service is alright."}
{"text":"Such a yummy place! Great baked goods and brunch is delicious! Definately a fun place to go and has reasonable amounts of seating compared to many places. Sometimes there is quite a lineup, but well worth it."}
{"text":"This place is more of a 3.5 because I am absolutely, head over heels, in LOVE with the ambiance and decor. Alforno is absolutely stunning and the design is beautifully simplistic and modern; I love the white minimalistic look and clean lines. Your creamer section for coffee is set up with everything you want on tap, which I think just makes the place even more chic. The place is also pretty spacious and bright with upper level seating and also a small outdoor patio. I've been there  a few times and on busier days (specifically lunch), I like that they have 2 lines designed for those staying and those ordering 'to-go'.   I've only been here a few times, with hopes that the food and drinks can live up to it's beautiful interior, but alas they have fallen short. I first came here with a girlfriend for coffee and desserts and we both loved the chocolate cream puff. I got the butternut squash soup and found it to be really underseasoned and bland (I had to add a decent amount of s + p). I figured it might've been an off batch and decided to give it another chance. The 2nd time I came I decided to get the sirloin steak sandwich as well as the butternut squash soup again. I found the bread to the sandwich to be incredibly hard (even wondering if it was stale) and just difficult to eat. The soup was better then my first time, but still found it to be slightly lacking. The bread it came with was really good though!   I'll still be returning to this place because I really want to like it more and so far their desserts haven't disappointed me. It's a great place situated next to Eau Claire for some coffee and desserts and to catch up with friends. Brunch? So far, I'd say pass and try something else."}
{"text":"Incredibly sub par pizza. Your money is better spent at Famoso or similar. Soup of the day was okay but took a long time to reach the table.  There is no indication that you can only order the sandwiches during the day which is why we went in the first place."}
{"text":"Artisan breads and desserts.  Benny and pancakes that don't leave you feeling heavy - and delicious of course. Spiced iced tea and mamosas with a kick. Brunch is great (weekday luncheon is less good - business diner volumes and reduced quality)."}
{"text":"We came to Alforno for a casual girls night a few weeks ago. We had all heard a lot of hype about the cafe and we weren't disappointed! Super cute place, very nicely decorated and comfortable. The staff were friendly and we were all pleased with our orders.   I'll definitely be back for coffee/ tea! I'd like to try their brunch too."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood breakfast joint recommended by my Airbnb host and did not fail to impress. Great Java, breakfast selection (entrees and sandwiches), and tons of baked good and desert options. Like many Calgary establishments the Wifi could use a fiber upgrade that said they do have tap to pay. Wished I had gone there since day one as I caved and hit the Starbucks nearby the first morning. Great find in a cool quiet little neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Solid, solid four stars.  Beautiful comfortable hip designed space with large sloping  glass roof, let's in lots of natural light which makes the place bright, welcoming and cheery. Upset level lofty seating, fabulous premium organic coffees from single source farms. Secretary premium coffee and drinks bar area.  Spotlessly clean with friendly, cheerful folks working there.  Outdoor seating available in season.  Fresh breads are delicious, food is simple but fresh and tasty, with organic options. Service is fast, but you're not rushed. Sufficient choice of sandwiches, pastas, pastries etc.Not sure if it's everyday but C$4.99 Mimosas!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the prices good but, you have to do something about the check-in registers. Either have 1 line-up leading to the 2 registers or 2 line-ups, one for each register. How about a conenvient location for the coffee sugar, milk, cream, etc.? Couldn't find it. This is not up to Tretao's standards. There seems to be little management around to take care of busy periods! Positive feedback because I like the food and location."}
{"text":"My new favorite Calgary coffee shop. 11 out of 10 for ambiance. 10 out of 10 for service. The tea was excellent. Haven't had the coffee, yet."}
