{"text":"Had my son's birthday party there had 12 people come to the party everybody was very disppointed with the service. I asked several times for the waitress to clear the table and she just ignored me. Food was average at best, would not recommend this place to anyone. Found out today that they are going out of business yahhh they fucking suck dog shit.."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, I think the service is iffy.  I do like the food, but I'd rather go to Dave and Busters"}
{"text":"Bo0o0o0o00o0o. NPC blows. Asshole bartenders, slow service, nice if you like to overpay or like the dirty feeling of being raped in the bum. Ok, so I gave one additional star since Spinelli had her birthday there"}
