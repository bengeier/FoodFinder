{"text":"Friendly staff, clean place, but really slow!  Went for lunch and had to leave after waiting 40 minutes for food - it arrived as I was leaving/paying for my drink.  It looked good, but  they are slow."}
{"text":"We've been going to sushi brokers for years and we have always enjoyed the sushi.  The staff is friendly and professional. However the portions continue to shrink more and more.  Wake up call to the owner don't be so cheap or you're going to lose all your returning customers.  I'm not sure I will be able to continue using chop sticks at the owner's rate of reducing the portions.  Watch Christmas vacation; it's not all about your bottom line.  Stop being so cheap!"}
{"text":"A great sushi place. Love the bento box happy hour special. I love this place. Recommend 100%. I would go here everyday if I could. Happy hour is affordable too. Staff is great. No complaints."}
{"text":"I recently went here for reverse happy hour with my friend, Jason, on a Friday night. Now, north Scottsdale is not our normal place and we rarely venture up there but my friend wanted to go. As a girl, I wish he gave me some warning as to what to wear because i noticed the girls there were slightly more dressed up while I was dressed in a t-shirt, jeans, and boots. A pair of heels would've been better to go with the crowd. The place had a good atmosphere, ambiance, and were playing some fun music to get you in the mood for the night if you were going out afterwords. I know I lip synced to a song and serenaded Jason so if his ears were bleeding, from my \"singing,\" his hearing must be going from something else. Or he was too distracted by the cute boy next to us. There was some eye candy there, also why I felt like I should have dressed a bit more.  Anyways, the place was nicely filled and we didn't wait to be seated at a table. We ordered a Diamondback roll, the calamari and the veggie tempura. I've gone to a few sushi places for happy hour and some don't give you the appropriate portion size, but here it was a good size for apps to be shared between two people. The calamari and tempura was all right. The tempura had a nice heat to it as well as our Diamondback roll. We were fairly full from our order. Jason also ordered the witch doctor drink, which he loved. I didn't try it, but I intend to next time."}
{"text":"The Wontons (Crab Ragoons) were just awful...it was a shame to spend $7 on such a horrible appetizer. The California roll had a stick of imitation crab and the Sashimi tasted like it was very poor quality/cheap. The music was blasting so that I had to yell across the table to my boyfriend. The bartender was sitting at the bar, drinking with his drunk friends.  Bottom line: I won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Happy hour is jam packed, service at the bar is only fair,  fare is a bit pricey.  The sushi rolls, though, melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"Sushis were good. The main dishes were average and over-priced for the quality. There are far better Japanese places in Phoenix and would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Absolute #1 sushi in Phoenix  I love this place.  I'm here at least once a month if not more.  Happy hour is reasonable.  You get high quality fish for what you are paying.  Rolls are different than your standard roll you find everywhere.  If you want something customized they will do it without any issues.  For drinks the spicy suno mono is fantastic."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a sushi bar in north Scottsdale Sushi Brokers is it. I have never found better sushi in north Scottsdale than at Sushi Brokers. Sushi Brokers has a great variety of creative sushi, that even first timers will love.   The quality of the fish that they use is fantastic, and the drink specials are wonderful at happy hour. Try the Spider Role (Soft Shell Crab) it is to die for. If you are in North Scottsdale, you must try Sushi Brokers. The best Sushi bar in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Well, I used to like this place aside from their crazy waits and clueless service, but now that I have a baby, I guess I'm no longer welcome there.   THEY HAVE NO HIGH CHAIRS OR BOOSTER SEATS?!?!?  That's just ridiculous. I went there with my husband and our 15-month-old daughter the other day and couldn't believe it when the hostess told us we were out-of-luck.   People with small children like sushi too."}
{"text":"Can't believe that anyone who's ever had quality sushi would like this place. This place would be out of business back in Cali. Not only is the sushi boring but it's WAY OVER PRICED!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour and great sushi.  I took my 7 year old kids to the sushi bar one day and the service was awesome.  It is tough to take kids out for sushi.  This place was super nice to our family.  1 of the guys made a real small roll of some kind for my kid to try.  Once the pieces were small enough for him to eat, he loved it.  Now my kids ask to go to Sushi Brokers every time we are near."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  It's nice to have a sushi spot in the neighborhood but the customer service and decor of this place could use some help.  Also, the phone number listed is wrong.  The first time I stopped in it happened to be their \"grand opening\" even though it had been open a couple of weeks already.  The manager apologized because it was over a two hour wait and said to call ahead the next day and that she'd make sure we had a table.  Well, it would've helped if she had told us the telephone number listed on yelp and on their website is wrong!!  We went in the next day anyways hoping she'd stick to what she had said.  And did she even acknowledge us?? NO.  We were still seated after only about ten minutes.  The sushi is pretty good.  I also had the salmon teriyaki, which was very salty, but the side of veggies it comes with was pretty good.  Overall it's nice to have a sushi spot in this neighborhood and the happy hour specials are good, but for a regular dinner or meal go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! I love the way this joint is run; especially management, very accessible and understanding. Jaime is an amazing sushi chef, and Eddy is just as good and great people and conversationalists. 10 star rating for sure"}
{"text":"Love this place... especially during happy hour.  It's the best Sushi place by far.  I love their Las Vegas rolls. Yum!!"}
{"text":"According to our server, Sushi Brokers is \"a sushi place for people who don't like sushi.\"  So is that a good sign or a big, red flag? How you answer is probably a good indication of how much you'll like this place.  The fish is fresh, however purists beware - a lot of it is smoked or cooked, and the vast majority of the rolls include 'krab.'   After taking a seat at the bar it was a waiting game for drinks, refills, our bill, etc. though our chef - Eddie - definitely knew what he was doing.  It's a good atmosphere but, as other reviewers have stated, on the pricey side. Dinner for 2, with 2 bombers, over $100, plus tip.  In the end we were full, but also reminded how much we miss Zen32."}
{"text":"The food is decent, some of the non-sushi items like the Seafood Dynamite are amazing, but the two stars comes from the behavior of the owner.  He uses the establishment as a hangout for his drunk friends, and you cannot be seated near him for more than 2 minutes without hearing a slew of derogatory statements about women, minorities, and every religion known to man. The amount of racial slurs that fall out of the mouthes of him and his associates is so impressive that I am amazed that anyone continues to visit his establishment.  The worst thing I have seen occurred about three weeks ago. Have you ever wondered why so many of the complaints about this restaurant involve the lack of accommodations for children? Because the owner doesn't want them there. A man was in the establishment with his two year old, who began to cry. Not throwing a tantrum, but gently cry. The owner proceeded to go up to the man with two of his friends and began trying to drunkenly fight the man while he was holding his toddler.  Unacceptable behavior on the part of management is the reason I am no longer going to be visiting an establishment. If I want dinner and a show, I am going somewhere that the gladiators are both over the age of 3."}
{"text":"Their Happy Hour is the bomb and the service was lovely too! We ate so much for so little! We will be back! I love the diamondback rolls!!!!"}
{"text":"\"trendy, loud-music, ok-sushi!\" - 2/5  When we lived right across the street from the Sushi Brokers, J and I used to go there at least once a month for its happy hour. We probably had been there at least 8 times with friends and family. I have to say that the quality was good for the start but went downhill since then. The price was right if you go during the happy hour. Other time, kinda expensive with the quality and service. It was a seen-to-be-seen place with ok-quality sushi."}
{"text":"Hmmmm, I'm saddened by the other reviews. I love the sushi here and everytime we go somewhere else (zen32, ra, stingray, some little place in Chandler that was supposed to be THE BEST) we always wish we had made the trek up to Sushi Brokers. Sometimes the service is just ok but Saturday at 4:30 pm its perfect.  The Cowboy Roll is out of this world.... we usually go during Happy Hour pricing and arent big drinkers so our bill isnt usally too high. Oh, and the people watching is awesome."}
{"text":"We have been goingg  to Sushi Brokers @ 3-4 times a month for a long time but I have decided until they change their music I won't go back. I love their food but their music is terrible - very loud (even when the restaurant is not full) and head-banging rock which is not conducive to a fun meal with family or friends. We have mentioned it a couple of times to staff and they said they agree and understand but the owner/manager likes that kind of music. Too bad it' not the kind of music that most of their clientelle would find appropriate!"}
{"text":"Won't be back anytime soon . . . Went back for our second visit, itching to use a gift card that was soon to expire.  Arrived shortly after happy hour, and were seated at a high top next to the back door.  Not a great table--I immediately noticed the stains on the wall next to the table (soy sauce?).   We ordered the pork potstickers, which were tiny and overcooked.  I asked for the mustard to come on the side, so they didn't give us any.  Next came the hot lips roll--sounded good but looked like a pink mayo-globbed mess, no way to eat with chopsticks, and forget picking it up with your hands!   My date liked it,  however.   I had a little sushi (nigiri), sake and maguro--decent quality.  My date had the beef and broccoli, which was decent, and I asked for a side order of the wok vegetables.  I expected my vegetables to be a small side dish, but they came out as big as an entree.   Quantity, but not quality--they were mushy and sitting in a puddle of soy sauce (couldn't make out any other flavors).   Service was so-so, maybe because we were hidden in the corner.  I'm glad we had a gift card, or I would have been even more disappointed.  Better sushi at AJ's, honestly."}
{"text":"I don't know if I had a bad batch or what. The philly rolls were plain and DRY!! The spicy yellow tail rolls were also dry and very very fishy! I've never had yellow tail that had such a fishy taste or smell before. Thankfully, the tuna nigiri was pretty good, but that's it. I'm so disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went there on Friday with wife and friends to enjoy sushi and hangout . Sushi was good ...  But the MUSIC they BLAST ! So loud sucked ! I have been here a dozen times and like this place,  I go back and have to YELL at friends sitting next to me . I will find Another Sushi Place ."}
{"text":"Decided to check out the new sushi place downtown Gilbert because my husband and I were excited to go somewhere different than our regular Postinos or Liberty Market. We ordered potstickers and 2 sushi rolls. We actually sent the potstickers back they were so bad. They were soggy and all dough. The rolls were ok nothing I would I would need to try again. The sushi is actually pretty expensive.... $14-15 for specialty rolls. I would be willing to give it a second try and maybe order something different."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times.  Sushi Brokers has one of the Friendliest Staffs & Best Sushi in the business and they are always on top of keeping your drinks filled and your food prompt.  As for the Sushi, it is some of the freshest & best in town, certainly the best I have found on a consistent basis.  I normally go during one of their Happy Hours as the prices are much more affordable then.  They have two Happy Hours, one from 4 - 6:30 pm, then a reverse Happy Hour from 10:30 to Close.  My favorite Sushi rolls here are the Chimichunga, Cowgirl (Abbie Style), Surfer & The Sanchez.  Music is current Hits and helps the place feel fun.  Eye Candy is great.  Stop by & check them out."}
{"text":"My self and my  sweet heart went to this place for an afternoon lunch, We had a wonderful server but during our dinning I had a small shot bottle of rum to cool off from the wasabi but then all sudden a lady name Jessica showed up screaming at us saying \"we can't have alcohol here in the building\", meanwhile there is nothing in the restaurant indicating that we  cannot have alcohol in the building as they serve alcohol there too!. Because of this incident  my sweet heart and I did not even order dessert. As much as we like the sushi we do not plan to ever go there again.Very poor service."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! The fish is always fresh, get the lollipop and citrus yellowtail. Great service and atmosphere. The servers are always positive and on point, and lunch has a great bento box special where you can choose any roll in the box! Went there for lunch today and loved it once again!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to get sushi in Gilbert. I personally recommend the Volcano chicken."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Service was slow and the miso soup took 25 minutes. The meal took 40 minutes. This was at lunch with very few other patrons. The smell in the restaurant itself had a funky smell-fishy- which should have been our first indicator.  I would skip it. Not the best sushi restaurant. You can do better."}
{"text":"I am visiting Scottsdale for 10 weeks and found Sushi Broker closest to my place. The first time I went, I went with my friend from Japan. We both enjoyed the sushi and found some rolls better then others. My Japanese friend was happy with the quality and taste....she has much more experience with sushi then I do.   We did go during happy hour and thus the prices were very good.  The second time I went, I had a good experience.  Although, with the spicy tuna and spicy salmon, there is too much heat and thus it looses the taste of the fish.    Both visits we really liked any of the rolls that used the eel sauce. Very tasty.  Both times we went during happy hour."}
{"text":"Awesome prices, and the food is top notch in the sushi department!   The service is also great and really great happy hour!"}
{"text":"Unimpressed. The crab tasted like imitation crab from the store. We're huge sushi fans but we were disappointed here. On the plus side, service was great."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but it is way overpriced for what it is. The server was not very friendly, and she wasn't attentive.  If that wasn't bad enough, I ended getting FOOD POISONING from this place! When I called to let them know about it the next day, the hostess brushed it off and said that they never have gotten any complaints about food poisoning before. She didn't offer me anything; she didn't apologize.  I already would never have returned to Sushi Brokers after the meal, but after realizing that this place gave me food poisoning, and after they were so nonchalant about it, I don't ever want to see or think of this place again!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times, and have never had a bad experience.  The happy hour menu is reasonably priced and stopping in for an early dinner and a beer won't break you.   I've eaten alone at the bar and the bartenders and wait staff were attentive.  I've eaten with other folks and the wait staff was helpful in picking out several rolls to share.  The sushi is good. Service is quick.  Good little spot."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of sushi and have tried it all over the place. Bottom line is this is the best and freshest sushi I've had in Arizona. They have a unique selection of there own menu items that are amazing like the surfer and jalapeño tail. Price is a little high if it's not happy hour but worth it if you really enjoy fresh sushi."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. We had the Surfer, Damn Good and Yellowtail in citrus. All were amazing."}
{"text":"While the sushi is exceptional and the menu is incredibly creative, I had to rank a sub-par score based on the poor service. I was attracted to the GF options as a customer with celiac. When ordering my sushi I already knew the accommodations that needed to be made to make the roll GF. My server disappeared, delivered my roll but no GF soy sauce. I asked a server for GF soy sauce...she never returned.  I asked my server for GF soy sauce...she delivered a bottle of soy sauce clearly marked as soybeans then wheat as the main ingredients.  I waited another 10 mins before my boyfriend told another server that I asked for GF soy sauce. She finally brought over the appropriate soy sauce, meanwhile my boyfriend waited 45 min for his rolls to be delivered. Our server was unapologetic for bringing a bottle of soy sauce that would have made me sick and dropped off the bill with no accommodations or write offs given the wait for food or potential allergy risk. We still tipped her but didn't feel like we had a dining experience worth $100 for two people. In addition, they ran out of wine glasses so we drank our wine from Stella Artois goblets. Very disappointing given that the sushi is incredible."}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because of the service and will definitely try this location again. They will really need to step it up to impress because I left feeling bummed! I was originally going to go to a different restaurant for dinner and at the last second noticed sushi brokers and had heard it was great. I went in with high expectations.   I stepped in to find the place half-full and at happy hour except no one greeted me at the door. I stood there for a few minutes and no one came by to seat me so I decided to seat myself at the bar counter. No one said 'hi', no one welcomed me, no one brought me water. Instead I was handed the menu, told it was happy hour and the individual rushed off. I went over the menu and made my selections but no one ever came by to take my order, or if I had any questions, and the place was not that busy for a Saturday afternoon. I decided to take my menu and went back to the hostess stand to see if I can get anyone to notice I was there.  Finally, a gentleman came out and apologized. Great. He didn't take me to a table, I gave him my order and he left me at the front of the building, so I again, seated myself at a table. No one ever came by with anything else. I certainly did not feel welcomed, I felt awkward. Yet looking around at the other tables I can see the waiters, and even the host who reappeared, taking care of the other guests and couldn't help but feel cheated of having that kind of experience -- simply because I was there to eat on my own. I was fully prepared to walk out had my food not arrived in sufficient time.  I ordered the las vegas, surfer and damn good. The las vegas came out missing the avocado. I flagged someone down and told them the avocado was missing and they went back to correct it--only to come back to the table to tell me it was there but it was small enough to miss. Do not tell me I am wrong when I fished around the roll and yielded no avocado. They corrected the mistake but the las vegas roll was made so big that the filling kept falling out whenever I lifted up a piece. I liked the damn good with the sweet chipotle sauce. Surfer was alright but not my favorite. They did keep my drink refilled which I was pleased with.  When it came time to leave, it took nearly 10 minutes for someone to notice I was waiting for someone to come by to collect my card to pay. I am going to give Sushi Brokers another try and I encourage everyone else to, I enjoyed the meal. If Sushi Brokers managers peers at this please be sure every guest, whether they are eating alone or with a group, is treated as everyone else and to make that dining experience top notch. Next time I hope to re-review and provide 5 stars because the meal was enjoyable."}
{"text":"If you want mexican sushi this is the place. The staff has no concept of customer service, the so called \"sushi chefs\" are more interested in ass gazing and hitting on women instead of paying attention to what their doing. I ordered a sashimi salad, most terrible sashimi salad I ever had. The guy from the kitchen put the greens on the ledge for the sushi chef to finish it. My plate sat there for 15 minutes. When I got my food, the greens were warm, the quality of the fish is garbage. It looked like they used scraps and trimmings for my sashimi salad and worst part of all the dressing is so sour. I also asked for miss soup, the waitress did not tell me that they charge 4.00 for a small bowl of stinking miss soup. I will never go back there nor refer this place to anyone. THIS Is The Worst Japanese Restaurant I've Been to. Well, I don't consider it a Japanese restaurant. It's more like a Mexican restaurant trying to make japanese food. Terrible and not worth the money. You want real sushi? Go to takamatsu."}
{"text":"Meh...let me start off by saying that I am super spoiled when it comes to good Sushi.  I went there during happy hour a couple of days ago. What was nice is, that the drink specials were good. $2 for a large Asahi is A-OK and awesome in my book. What made me frown a bit is that there was absolutely no happy hour for food. A bit of a let down to be honest.  We ordered three rolls..The Chimichanga roll, Asparagus roll and Diamondback. First of all...15 bucks for a specialty roll? And there is nothing special about it...unless you consider drowning the roll in spicy mayo and eel sauce? Maybe that was to mask the uber-fish taste of the spicy tuna? I don't know. I think they should have called this sushi soup...  Finally, the service. It was ok. Nothing more. Not even an ounce more. Very impersonal and not very efficient.  Overall not impressed. The only thing that pushed it to three stars were the drink specials. Maybe they should rename the joint to \"booze brokers\"...just a thought..."}
{"text":"Very fresh fish! Fun atmosphere for happy hour. Honestly, the best sushi you'll find out here in the desert. I love their sashimi."}
{"text":"The best sushi ever great service also, fast service and great polite people also happy hour on Saturday 3pm to 630pm"}
{"text":"Found the sushi to be very overpriced compared to other places in the area like Stingray or RA. Service was Ok, but you didnt get a warm feel from servers. The sushi itself was fine, but took a long time to prepare, and they def seem to love their tempora and specialty rolls. The prices themselves just are not worth the experience, and I would not go back again"}
{"text":"I ordered a lot of fried rolls and they are all yummy. Also, I like the fact that their drinks are not watered-down. Cocktail/drinks during happy hour is the bomb!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi restaurant..I've been going here for years & love the place.   The sushi is fresh simply excellent..they have some unique rolls.  love the atmosphere and the music."}
{"text":"I only go here for happy hour. Yes, it is hideously overpriced if not happy hour, and the decor and loud music would be a little odd if you were going here for a nice dinner. As an after-work/snack type place, it works for me. My girlfriend hates all the flat-screen TVs and how they show ESPN and sporting events because it distracts me. :)  Felt the need to defend this place due to some negative reviews. Have had a lot of good meals and drinks here. Their prices are very good during happy hour (which is 7 days a week!) and reverse happy hour. I stick to basic stuff (I'm a basic man) but they do that well. $2 Salmon/Yellowtail/Tuna nigiri? Yes please. My girlfriend loves the Philly roll, the Vegas roll is one of the better ones I've had, and the Damn Good roll is something unique...maybe a little too sweet and oversauced but worth a try once. My friend ordered some quail egg thing once and he said it was spoiled...but I don't usually mess with that so I can't say. Just beware of the more exotic things, I guess.  Seems to be a lot of turnaround in the wait staff...I come here fairly frequently and seem to get a different person every time. Though for the most part, they do a good job. A friend of mine just got a job at the bar here but I never sit at the sushi bar so can't vouch for that experience."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious sushi, usually good service, but the noise level is astoundingly high. Can't usually have a detailed conversation with the person sitting across from you. But the happy hour deals are a big plus!"}
{"text":"Just moved out this way from Chandler and eat here at least once a week. Pretty consistent and very friendly service. a little noisy at times but thats ok I guess I'm just getting old. great food, great price.."}
{"text":"Never thought you would get a good burger at a sushi restaurant.....BUT Sushi Brokers has an unbelievable one!  Outstanding!!"}
{"text":"I'm  providing two stars based solely on the experience we've had prior to this evening (meaning we've had pleasant enough service prior to tonight to somewhat counteract the less than mediocre service we experieced this evening).   Tonight we were coldly greeted by \"Sidney\" who when I inquired as to the booth availability firmly stated that there were none available as she swiftly (and w/out agreement on our part) led us to a tall 4 top table. I politely stated that we would  sit at the bar for a drink & wait for a booth (which she said would be 15-20 minutes) but in reality only took about 5-10 (not complaining here as I realize restaurants always quote longer so as not to disappoint).   Sidney's idea of letting us know our table was ready was to approach us at the bar & state in an extremely unfriendly (almost burdened) voice that our booth would be ready shortly. This declaration was accompanied by what can only be classified as an annoyed head toss in the direction of the booth. Had we not had exemplary service at the bar by Hayden we would have just left at this point.  We proceeded to sit at the booth for over 10 minutes w/out a visit from a soul. My husband had to actually approach the (extremely unfriendly & unhelpful) hostess (Sidney) who was behind the bar at the time to inquire as to why we had not yet been approached. Sidney clearly had no idea that we had not yet been approached, yet was unapologetic upon realization that this was in fact the case. Let it be known that the restaurant as a whole was not whatsoever busy at this time.  Rather than spend much more time on this review, I will simply say this - we have been patrons of Sushi Brokers since it opened around 4+ years ago. We spend well over $100 every visit & visit on average 2-3 times/month. Our service had always been exemplary not only at the bar, but at the hostess stand as well. Having an individual at the helm & basically as the face of your restaurant that clearly would rather be anywhere but is an insult to your customer base & a drain on your repeat business. Too bad as it negatively impacts your amazing sushi chef team & bar staff."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in the whole world.  All the rolls are made to order, and the calamari is a favorite as well."}
{"text":"Decent sushi, moderate prices and good ambiance. Has been my go-to sushi place when in town."}
{"text":"YUM! YUM! YUM!  I went here the other night with a friend of mine who suggested it.  We did wait for about 25 minutes for a table but it was WELL worth the wait.  We started with edamame which was pretty good... then we had some sushi and it was incredible.  I had the Rainbow Roll and it was TO DIE FOR!!!  For dessert we had these crunchy apple tempura bites with whipped cream and vanilla ice cream... HOLY SMOKES!  Service was amazing and I will DEF be back for more!"}
{"text":"Received very bad customer service tonight on Easter, writing this review to warn customers that sushi brokers does not offer any help when takeout orders are prepared wrong by the kitchen. Had to return to the restaurant after realizing my order was incorrect when I arrived back at my house, and after arriving back at the restaurant, they gave me the food I originally ordered and did not give any compensation or coupons when I specifically asked the manager if that seemed fair. Very unsatisfied with the level of customer service at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been waiting so long for this place to open up! I'm glad that the wait is over and it was not a let down! I love their lunch menu you can get a bento box for about 8 to 15 bucks. The 15 dollar one includes a specialty roll, cucumber salad, miso, rice, and wok veggies. So much for for such a good price! I got the cowboy roll, spicy tuna inside and tuna and spicy sauce on the top-----soo good! I'm a huge tuna lover! I cant wait to eat here more now that's its open!"}
{"text":"This is only the third time that I have ever taken the time to do a write-up on a restaurant and the other two times were to rip the restaurant apart.  That means this is the first time I EVER did a write-up for positive reasons but I must share my experience.  About four weeks ago on a Friday evening my family and I went in to Sushi Brokers for some take out.  They were exceptionally busy at the time but we wanted sushi so we were patient. We go there often enough that the chefs there basically know us and what we like. We placed our order then sat and had a drink while we waited. When the order was bagged up and being processed for payment, I noticed that something was wrong - the amount we were charged and the amount of sushi we were taking home was way more than normal. Like I said, it was very busy and we have been going there for so long that we assumed the best, left, and just figured we would get a better understanding as to why when we got home.  Well, when we got home our concerns were realized - what we were served was way more than we ordered - no real fault mind you, just a miscommunication/misinterpretation but a mistake nonetheless.  Because we like Sushi Brokers so much, at first we decided to not say anything.  But then as time went on it was getting to me.  So, two weeks after the incident, I reached out to them and spoke with their Sr./General Mgr, Evan.  We spoke for no more than 3-5 minutes and once Evan fully understood what had happened he told me that the next time I come to the restaurant he would \"take care of me/us\".  Famous last words right?  So a week ago Sunday we took a Sushi snob friend of ours from California to Sushi Brokers before sending him home.  Sushi Brokers made their famous hand rolls (best I have ever had bar none), their famous sashimi pizza (yes I said that correctly and damn well worth trying at least once), and their famous pickled wasabi tobiko.  My friend was blown away and in fact he and his family are coming back to the valley over Xmas break and that is the first place he wants to take his them.  But here is the kicker.  EVERYONE IN THE PLACE KNEW WHO WE WERE.  Evan not only \"took care of us\", but he made ABSOLUTELY SURE that everyone took care of us.  Then after a wonderful enough experience that our sushi snob friend wants to make going to Sushi Brokers a staple every time he comes to town, but when the check came it was discounted enough to completely make up for the over spend the time before.  So, in conclusion, while you may find \"better sushi\" elsewhere if you try hard enough, you will NEVER find a better combination of quality, originality, ambiance, and most important REAL ass-kissing customer service.  Sushi Brokers always had us at \"hello\" each time we went, but now they have us returning every time after each \"good-bye\"."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a Friday night, but the sushi quality is lacking the standard found (and expected) elsewhere in Scottsdale. Friendly staff, but expect to find dirty dishes and sticky menus laden with slimy fingerprints. To make things worse, the sushi was below par and the salmon roll was littered with fish bones. Big no no  Try Sumo Maya, Roka Akor, or Stingray for a better sushi outing."}
{"text":"Sushi pizza is great...I recommend getting it without cheese...cheese and sushi just doesn't sound good"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour! Went with a group of friends after work and had a great time.   The food was defiantly the highlight of the evening. Everything was fresh and a great price. Great drinks also.   The service was just OK. They were busy, but still no one seemed to go out of there way to be friendly or helpful. I'll definitely go back for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"food was ok and very skimpy on the portions for the price of it. food also took forever prob 30min and it wasn't even that busy and we ordered 2 teriyaki chicken bento boxes. we thought we were going in for a quick lunch. likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Sushi was DELICIOUS!...and the service was 5 star...great place I can't wait to come back to!"}
{"text":"Dined there again about a week ago.  Almost identical experience as last time.   Sat at the bar with my wife and ordered the same thing.    Server disappeared to the kitchen.  When food arrived we were short a side of rice  & bomber & glass empty.  Started eating... several minutes later my wife flags down the hostess.  The hostess ended up doing most of the work,  brought my the side of rice, found the server, asked him to grab us our beer.  If it wasn't for my wife's persuasion I wouldn't have ordered the extra drinks our of frustration.  From a business stand point the servers are killing the business.  This place needs a front of the house Manager with PRESENCE.  Servers need to to be involved and alert.  I'm sure extra sales are being missed.  Kudos to our hostess which \"saved\" the day.  I believe her name was \"Tia\".  She seemed to be picking up the slack all over the place. Once again over tipped by tipping out the hostess (more than the server).  Food.. jalepeno tail was great and the hamachi collar slightly burnt."}
{"text":"music a bit loud. overpriced for the quality. good servers.  hamachi kama was good. miso salad was too salty. typical american style sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Where do I start. We walked in the restaurant they only had six tables wasn't busy didn't see anybody for at least five minutes sitting at the bar. Finally got a server to get us water which took another five minutes. Then time went by without menus approximately 10 minutes I never saw anybody again for 20 minutes.  We decided to get up and leave and walk out we were chased down by the girl who is visually upset that we were leaving and apologized over and over again saying that she was new was trying to handle all the tables in the bar. I asked to see the manager the manager walked out with the dumbest look on his face never said a word to us she kept blaming it on herself and I told her it was the managers fault for staffing. Horrible service think twice about going there. It's not the sushi brokers I remember  Ok I made this comment and I was immediately contacted back by the owner who offered his apologies and explained he was dealing with broken equipment in the kitchen. He stated is was remiss in not watching the front of the house while he was dealing with equipment. He also invited us back and offered to have the meal on him.  Stand up guy. This was a first for me to have a response with explanation amazing how things can change your mind"}
{"text":"Love love love their happy hour! Quality sushi in Arizona for a great price. My fiancé and I go there about twice a month. Definitely recommend this place over other sushi restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Unbelievable... Great tuna, great surfer roll. BUT, how can you advertise \"Fresh, Top quality fish\" when the Uni was so obviously old and runny and stunk like rancid fish. So old, the sushi chef let me know, \"I threw in an extra piece\"... of course you did, you have to get rid of it. I have eaten Uni all over the world and taken it straight out of the sea and cut it open myself... the worst I've ever had. Learn a lesson, you can kill people serving this as old as it was. Terrible."}
{"text":"This was by far the best dining experiences we have had in a very long time. Me and my friend arrived last night around 6:00pm to be greeted by the host. The restaurant was pretty crowded at this time. The host kindly guided us back to our table and handed us the menu. Never dining at Sushi Brokers before I was already impressed. Our waitress remy arrived soon after and introduced herself kindly and offered to get us started with a beverage.   Remy recommend her favorites through out our meal such as Spring Rolls and the Surfer Roll. Trusting her recommendations we started our meal with these.   The Sufer Roll was absolutely fantastic and super fresh. I also got tuna sashimi on the side, quality of the fish was like nothing I've had before. We decided Sushi Brokers had our business anytime when we want to get sushi. Great service and great food, Will most definitely be coming back and will be asking for remy!"}
{"text":"Sushi Brokers is a go to spot for me, I come here multiple times a week!! Not only is the sushi amazing with great happy hour prices but they have great service! I usually go with my boyfriend who's allergic to everything (sesame seeds, avocado, shellfish, + tons more) and they always help us with specializing our rolls so he can eat them!  Every time I go we always request McKenna, she is just amazing!! She's so nice and helpful and just makes the whole experience so much better! I'd highly recommend asking for her section next time you're in! Also the Las Vegas, Cowgirl/Cowboy, and calamari are BOMB"}
{"text":"The Surf and Turf roll is a real treat!"}
{"text":"I took my wife and daughter there on a Wednesday night.  We have tried every Sushi place in town.  SB is a cut above the rest!!!"}
{"text":"I  begrudgingly gave Sushi Brokers another shot and am so glad that I did! We have been a couple times for for happy hour and have had excellent food and great service.  It took me a while to give it a shot after our awful first experience but it is clear that they have worked out all of the kinks and this is now one of my fave sushi spots in the area!"}
{"text":"I have been to Sushi Brokers twice now. My 2nd time was today for their 4-6:30pm happy hour.  My girl Jessica & I got there around 5:15. I think we just beat the dinner rush because by the time we left around 7:30 it was pretty packed.  Our server Jessica was a sweetheart & good about checking on us. We had all our rolls on the table in about 10-15 mintues.  We started off with bombers. Yum! For our rolls we ordered: crunchy, philly, vegas & chimichanga. We also ordered a piece each of the yellowtail hamachi. Everything was so yummy, we almost finished it all.  For happy hour it was still a little pricey but not too bad. Our total was $59 not including tip.   Definitely will be back for more sushi dates with my girls!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today and were served by Heather and the two sushi chefs and we had a great time. Got my usual Asahi and decided to try out the cowgirl roll. Yummmmmmmmm. Also had a try of the quail egg/sake shooter which was pretty good lol, just not for the texture averse. Either way I'm happy that Sushi Brokers is now in my town! I'll be back asap.   To the chefs you guys are awesome  To Heather thanks for the great service"}
{"text":"I have heard nothing but great things about Sushi Brokers from my friends and other locals. So when my friends and I decided to meet there for reverse happy hour I was really excited. Once we got there we were barely greeted and were treated as an annoyance. Once seated our waiter was less than thrilled to accommodate any of our needs. Once the food and drinks were out there were many mistakes made. My friends and I were nothing but polite and ate the food that was brought out.   Overall the food and drinks were very tasty and definitely worth going back for. The service on the other hand was lousy . I will try Sushi Brokers again in hopes for better service. Luckily their product is great :)"}
{"text":"Went to new Gilbert location downtown Gilbert. Wonderful service, Sushi was fantastic prices are very reasonable, a must go!!  We will definitely be there again!"}
{"text":"I am astounded by how bad the sushi is here...so bad. The rice is like compacted cement. It is grossly over cooked and hard as well. Sounds impossible but true. I ordered uni with quail eggs it looked as if it were put through a blender and poured into a nigiri cup. Uni oozing down the sides.   Needless to say I will never be back. I just moved to Scottsdale as a chef and I sure as hell hope my future experiences will not be as excruciating to my delicate pallet."}
{"text":"This place is great it is my second time being here & everything was so good. I really like the dim lights at night its pretty nice inside. The drinks are great !!! The best part is the happy hour!! Las vegas roll , california roll, tootie & sanchez roll were amazing . I would give this a 5 star but , our waitress was a little unattentive . Other than that you must try this place its so worth the $$$$"}
{"text":"Just moved here last month from PNW and finding all the sushi joints around here.  Came here for lunch so my review applies only to that.  I am not really a fan of all the sushi rolls people order that have 18 different items and I typically order salmon with avocado and tuna with avocado rolls.  First off, this place is fairly expensive for a sushi lunch but the quality is almost worth the price.  They have some pretty neat looking sushi rolls (saw ones that look like lollipops) for those that enjoy that sort of thing.  I rate my opinions based on the raw salmon and tuna and this place is very very good, but a bit more expensive than other sushi places around here.  I may have to come try their happy hour. :)  (Kind of a sushi snob, coming from the PNW....lol)"}
{"text":"This place was freaking awesome!  Busy; but expected that on Fathers Day.  Drove into Phoenix from Vegas and we were hoongry!  Host ladies were friendly, server (Maddie) was GREAT and all the people that helped during our sushi frenzy were happy and kind.  Ordered multiple rolls and a couple of appetizers finishing it all off with a 1/2 sushi pizza and cocktail.  Wait, whaaat sushi pizza!  It was something different and like Maddie said the menu doesn't do it justice.  Great place and awesome food; will definitely be back.  Thanks"}
{"text":"This place is right across the street from us and fantastic. Eddie (chef) is always amazing, super friendly and always giving new ideas. He remembered us months after our first visit, which kept us coming  back. This is the best sushi place and worth every penny. Friendly staff and manager. I would  definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Will never come back to this place again watched a horrible bartender corner, harass, and bully a younger woman server. It was horrible to watch and completely unprofessional after berating her about her personal life she tried to walk away but the bartender didn't let her. It was honestly a scary thing to watch. This can't be the first time it has happened. Got the name of the bartender as I was leaving, Evan."}
{"text":"The sushi is over-priced and not worth it. Nothings worse than subpar sushi and a steep bill. This place used to be frequented by me but I have been disappointed a few times in a row now. I wish they would give it a face-lifted realism check. I don't think I will be back-but you know how it goes.. never say never."}
{"text":"Ownership at this restaurant is a joke...rude, racist and not deserving of the business.  The owner has multiple criminal charges pending due to fighting with police and being drunk on consistent basis.  He is abusive towards families and staff.  I witnessed him physically assaulting a father who's child was  crying.  Annoying yes but can't believe this happens in a place of business.  I love the food but will not be going back until RL Miller is either jailed or loses his liquor license...which is up for renewal this month per the Arizona Dept of Liquor License website.  I encourage as many people to call them and cause issues with the renewal.  You can also look up his criminal charges on the Scottsdale City Court webpage to confirm this information.  The community does not need this type of owner and behavior in the community."}
{"text":"I agree with Brian on the 2.5 stars.  I went here yesterday and was very disappointed.  Fortunately, my expectations were not too high, since I have yet to find a decent sushi joint after moving from LA.  Regardless, those were not met either.  #1 The fish was low quality, especially for the price.  #2 The staff was not knowledgeable!  For instance, when I ordered Toro, I received just normal maguro.  After arguing with the server for 5 minutes, he finally returned it to the kitchen and 15 minutes later brought back Toro.  This also was not very good quality.  If this place only served sushi it would be 0 stars, but since the decor was okay, and I enjoyed the setup I decided to give it 2 stars."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Brokers a lot recently with my bf.  He loves to go there on Sundays as they have a pretty good happy hour from 5-6:30.  Cheap sushi (obviously) but also good drink specials including 3-4$ VERY LARGE bottles of beer, including some specialty brands.  We are both avid sushi people and I would say the sushi is up there in terms of quality and taste, but maybe not the BEST in town.    Tip: If you're trying to go there during happy hour (esp on Sundays) it is smart to just grab a seat at the bar if you don't mind grabbing a stool.  Otherwise there's a very good chance you will wait for a table, and after you are seated, will have quite a wait for the food as well.    - I'm not a big bar girl, but my bf always snags us a couple seats there and we are served pretty quickly...I would probably never even attempt to get a seat during a busy time because I really think this is when the service starts going out the window."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in town!!! From the setting (great music) to the food.  Surfer roll, asparagus roll (wrapped in cucumber), volcano chicken, calamari,  kobe burger ...just a few of my favorites!!!  I love how they are willing to wrap any roll in cucumber....the coolness and crispness of the cucumber is a wonder addition/change to any sushi!!!! A lot of other places are reluctant to do that (maybe because it takes a little more time???)  And just to add a \"cherry on top\" (as if its needed)...one of the most beautiful servers I've ever seen.....not a common name...if memory serves..I believe it was Jillian...ask for her!! Not only is she \"easy on the eyes\" but she will give A+ service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places. I've always had a good experience with food and service. My favorite is the surfer roll. It is soooo good. They also have an apple sake that is good. I haven't been able to find it anywhere else."}
{"text":"Awesome Sushi! Last visit was on Mothers Day and I over heard a conversation involving the manager talking crap because some one called in sick so the hostess had to stay longer. I believe it went something like this \"what a 16 year old she is crying she can't hang out with her mother on Mother's Day\" if you are going to talk crap don't let the the guests hear it. The Manager working Mothers Day (5pm) stay classy!"}
{"text":"The first time we visited sushi brokers was in January. My mother in law never received her order. The server messed up on the bill. It took an hour to fix among our party. Today we went for Mother's Day around 2:00. Not very busy. It was seat yourself. We found a table and sat for 15 min before our drink order was taken. The order was taken by someone behind the bar who was so impatient that he tried walking away before all orders were taking. My husband never received his drink. The waitress said she would be with us shortly which was not true. We finally asked for our bill. So disappointing to give them a second chance and to even have a far worse experience. Not the Mother's Day sushi experience I had hoped for. Will never come back here."}
{"text":"Very good experience here, kind and attentive staff, and great food!  The staff offered suggestions and we felt very comfortable asking.  We sat at the bar during happy hour and watched as their chefs prepared the sushi, It was like personally visiting the Iron Chef set!"}
{"text":"Great sushi spot! Staff was friendly,  hostess even helped to fill our waters,  which were never half empty the entire time.  We ordered the California and the chimichanga rolls, both were fresh and flavorful.  We would highly recommend the chimichanga roll!  We will be back soon to try more!"}
{"text":"Just got california and damm good... And yes, just all good sushis!!! Close to to the Marriott, a perfect stop with friendly staff for a quick dinner."}
{"text":"I am a huge sushi fan and I have been to other Sushi Brokers in the valley. I have always had a good experience, however, not so much with this one. Let me start off by saying that the food is fantastic and the restaurant is clean, hence, the 3 starts. The reason for the loss of 2 stars is because the service was lacking. My friends and I ordered 4 rolls to start and then ordered 3 more after that. Well, they forgot to bring out 2 rolls and when I mentioned it to the waiter it took a very long time to get them. Then, when we were done and ready to leave, it took them a very long time to get our check. Overall I have to say that this was a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi restuarant in Scottsdale! Never had a bad order of anything. Edamame is the great! The salmon sashimi is always outstanding. Sometimes we just order apps. Sauces are delicious. It is a fun atmosphere, staff is very attentive, bartenders get your drinks right away."}
{"text":"Foods is really good but I have to agree with others that the service isn't very good.  Was in around 6 pm on a Saturday night and place was fairly crowded but not overly packed.  Service at the Sushi Bar was bordering on frustrating which made it hard to enjoy the great sushi.   I guess they survive on the fact that they have a great location and excellent food."}
{"text":"PROS:   The sushi is generally good. The service is generally good.  CONS: The sushi is pricey compared to other places. The HH is a bit short; it ends at 6:30 -- other places go later."}
{"text":"This last weekend me and a group of friends went to sushi brokers for some food and fun. To fit us all we rearranged the tables so we could all sit together and the staff couldn't have been more helpful with that. The food tasted nice and fresh packed full of flavor. Great place for a late night meal."}
{"text":"Hannah -- knocked it out of the park - super service - great attitude - wonderful food and service.  Price $ you get what you pay for! Will be back for sure - wife is trying happy hour with here friends.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced for what you get. I've had better box sushi from the grocery store. I'm originally from Seattle, so I tried to lower my expectations before coming here, ordered some simple items that are hard to mess up, and tried to ignore the fact that prices were three times higher than you would pay for better quality back home. The simple, no-fail items weren't offensively bad, but the only reason we managed to eat them was because we were famished. My boyfriend tried the crab rangoon and said it was pretty bad. It looked stale and oily from where I sat, but I can't vouch personally. Most of the rolls are of the \"let's see how many fried things and mayonnaise-based sauces we can fit on here\" variety.   The ambiance was OK, and our server was attentive (a little cold, but at least attentive). I would come back under the right amount of social pressure, but probably stick to a fountain drink and save the $100 tab for something actually good."}
{"text":"Disappoionted! Place looked pretty, but sushi was sooooooo expensive!  Now I wouldn't care one bit about that if it was worth it but it was not! Not creative. Not super fresh. Not even a food portion size. Ambience was loud and cavern like. Server was inattentive and couldn' remember our order. really sad. Next time it's another sushi place. Not this one."}
{"text":"Didn't have a horrible experience, but giving it 2 stars for \"Meh. I've experienced better\" might be giving it too much I think.  The food was not bad, but it wasn't good either.  The rice in the bento was dry. and stirfry that accompanied it was only seasoned with soysauce and pepper so ended up being a little too salty.  The miso soup tasted like salt water.  It wasn't too salty, but salt was all you can taste because it had little else.  The side salad in the bento was just shredded cabbage... that's it. No dressing...  The sushi was nothing special.  It was merely eatable.  This would have totally been fine if the price matched the food, but it didn't so I felt like I was ripped off.  For 15 bucks I expect something better than dry rice, soy sauce stirfry veggie, plain cabbage side salad and a sub par roll of sushi.  It's the equivalent of Kyoto Bowl, but at a higher price.  Also the service was extremely slow.  This would have been forgiven because our group was about 15 people, but the restaurant was far from packed.  Half of the restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a few years as I think it is really overpriced for the quality of the food.  Today I met a couple girlfriends for happy hour.  It took forever for the male bartender to acknowledge me.  He was less than attentive during our stay and not friendly at all.  I ordered a Spicy Salmon roll which I returned because it tasted so bad. Replaced it with Spicy Tuna which was just ok.  Yellowtail  roll was ok too but not great.  We also ordered on 3 different sheets so that we could get separate checks.  He gave us one bill & didnt even ask if we needed anything else before he closed us out. He did separate when we asked.  They also took my plate away when I wasnt looking without asking if I was done or if I wanted to take what was left on my plate.  I was planning on taking the 4 pieces I had left with me but once it was taken from me it was too late.  I don't ever plan on returning here again. Service sucked, food sucked and it is way overpriced!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Brokers is one of my favorite restaurants! It never disappoints! The egg roll appetizer is so good and my favorite roll is the Cowboy! Spicy and bomb! We have had Mckenna as our server a couple times now... she is so sweet and very personable! Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"For the second time this week our postmates order was denied more ham 30 minutes after placing the order.  Ridiculous and"}
{"text":"Food is very good. Spider hand roll is huge and tastes great. Service is fair. Music a little loud but interesting. Seating is weird, get a booth on the bar side of the restaurant or you legs will dangle in space."}
{"text":"Sorry there's no 0. By far the worst I've ever had.... I usually don't write reviews, but I can't let this go. -iced tea?? Nope. Bubblegum flavored water.  That should have said they didn't have regular iced tea instead if serving me this diet, fruit flavored crap. Horrible. Thought I would get a sprite instead... Sprite sucked too, how do you screw up sprite. Ask them I guess.  - gyoza (pot stickers)... Crap. I like them both pan fried or deep fried. They somehow screws that up too.  - rolls... My GF got something wrapped in salmon. Bad move. LITERALLY drowned in lemon juice (means its old as hell). Can't taste anything but overpowering lemon juice. Also, only 5 pieces. Everywhere else on earth served 8. -price.... R u kidding me??? Wouldn't eat that stuff if it was free.      Just another (and worst) trendy Scottsdale crap hole. I read someone got a hamburger there. Red flag. Would you get tacos from Pizza Hut??     Don't waste your time or money. EVER!!"}
{"text":"I go here a lot mostly for the awesome Happy Hour. The prices on Happy Hour food and drinks are really the best in the area and I like that I can sit at the bar and have a nice, relaxing and delicious experience. The music is definitely a bit loud and the staff is pretty meh but the food and drinks are good and the prices keep me coming back. I would definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"I really don't know why I'm only giving them 4 instead of 5 stars because their service and food are pretty darn good.  So far I've had the crunch roll, always and spicy tuna roll and recently discovered the ever so dangerous DAMN GOOD roll.  WOW...does that ever live up to it's name.  They aren't the cheapest place around but they are super nice from the second you walk in the door and the food has so far been quite tasty!"}
{"text":"Sad to write this review. My wife and I arrived Saturday night at 8:30 and was told their was a 5 minute wait. No worries.....we declined sitting at the sushi bar as we desired a booth. We have been coming here for years and always a great experience. Not tonight however. After 5-10 minutes, 4-5 Booth's and tables were available. We requested a specific booth, and the hostess and her assistant replied they weren't presently sitting anyone. ???  That they were taking a break to allow the servers to catch up. Mind you, we were first on the list, 4 other couples were behind us, and we were all waiting at the front near the door.....really no waiting area inside. After another 10 minutes, not only didn't i get the empty booth I requested, we got a small 2 seat table, while the 3-4 couples behind us all were seated at the larger booths and tables for 4. Clearly punishing me for letting them know of my displeasure of not being seated on time. I told the hostess that the table was terrible, and how she handled it was terrible. Zero response. Thankfully, our server was Rachel and she and the food performed at a high level. This place used to care, and at least pretended to be happy the clients were here. The experience that the 2 front end hostess personnel dished out was offensive and I wonder if they were properly trained, or worse, were trained and this is how the restaurant treats people now."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim. Service was good we wanted crab ragona but they were out so we tried the calamari. Tasted frozen and texture was not great. So we sent them back for pot stickers. They were greasy. Flavor was ok.   I got damn good roll and my husband got diamond back roll. They were good.   We Will never come back."}
{"text":"The food is good and service is friendly, but terribly, terribly slow!  My friend and I got our lunch about 45 minutes after ordering.  While the waitress (Suzi) blamed it on the kitchen, I am pretty sure she forgot to put our orders in and then did not notice until we were sitting there for 30 minutes.  All the other tables that were seated after us had almost finished their meals or were paying before we got our food.  We then waited a long time to get our checks and then a long time to have our cards run.  It was a 90 plus minute lunch."}
{"text":"We used to go to this place almost weekly since it opened. They always got something wrong. Tonight (11/17/17) the manager was rude and dismissive to my wife after we got carry out and then lied to her. Never again will we go to this place. Nice way to run a business. I wish I could give this establishment negative stars."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant 4 years ago and we decided to visit today since we were staying around the corner again.  We were very disappointed with the quality of the food, in particular, the sushi rolls.  We asked our waitress if the ownership had changed and she said no it is the same ownership.  She went on to say that they hired a new sushi chef a week ago.  The rolls that we ordered were smaller than the last time we were here and they lacked the flavor that we experienced before.  I think the owner needs do whatever it takes to get the other chef back or his business is going to suffer  Last but not least, the service.  I had to ask twice for sweetener for my tea and my wife didn't get a refill on her sprite after she asked.  When I spend $150.00 on a meal, I expect it to be great quality and the service must be impeccable.  My recommendation is to avoid this restaurant.  The one we went was in Scottsdale.  The waitress said they had another restaurant in the area.  All I can say is buyer beware."}
{"text":"I always have a great time at sushi brokers! Delicious sushi, fun music, and saki bombs. Plus great happy hour."}
{"text":"I lived in Arizona all my life and went to Sushi Brokers at least twice a month!! My very favorite rolls are the Damn Good and Cowboy. The best happy hour for sushi I found with a lot of rolls on it... After moving to VA last May, I find I head there first whenever I visit!!!"}
{"text":"Go here frequently, and have never ran into any of the issues other's have yelped about...  Best rolls Vegas Damn good Spicey cowboy/cowgirl  I like sashimi...but unless I'm someplace where it just came out of the water...I'm not eating it...so can't comment on that.  We usually go late in the afternoon and have always had good service and once we had a birthday party with 15 people on a busy night..  My Only complaint is the bathroom...it needs some work.....and I do not like hearing employees talking on their cell phone while sitting on the toilet."}
{"text":"Service was poor. Quiet Wednesday night for two and didn't start off on a good note. Forgot our waters, edamame and miso soup, and one sushi roll. Only ordered 2 rolls and a main entree for dinner and received our last roll when we were done with everything else. I understand that this stuff happens, but you can only handle so many mistakes on a weekday night. I ordered the chicken teriyaki and the chicken was rubbery. Really disappointed in the food, but most of all the service. Didn't feel wanted and won't return after this experience. Oh and the happy hour is weak and expensive compared to other sushi spots near us."}
{"text":"One of the most overpriced sushi joints in the valley.. Bad service.. Quality of food is on par with premade sushi from grocery store. Only reason why this joint is not out of business is because of location. Not worth going."}
{"text":"As most, I will unfortunately not review a place unless it is exceptional, or has a poor showing on the night of my visit.  I have been here no less than 50 times, I live down the block so it is easy enough.  I actually do not even eat sushi, I am a vegetarian but they have always been very accommodating.  Tonight I took my girlfriend that was craving sushi over for a quick bite.  I was just there last week and remembered my food being fairly awful, tonight was the same.  We had the vegetarian lettuce wraps, kind of sticky and gross when sometimes its actually pretty good.  I had the vegetarian roll, all the ingredients seemed old. Kind of weird for a Monday when fresh vegetable are delivered.  I use to hear great things when I brought friends, I am pretty sure tonight was my last visit.  I can accept an off night, or two, or even three but now it the norm.  My biggest pet peeve at one point is that the place does not have booster seats for kids.  Who cares right? I normally wouldn't but when I asked the hostess why they didn't have any children's seats, I was told \"the owner hates kids.\" Huh?  This was told to me one a year ago, I did not review the place negatively so I am clearly not too upset about that one."}
{"text":"Great Sushi and Service! Staff was great and friendly. Waitress brought out a spicy sauce we didn't ask for and it was amazing for our sushi rolls. I am so glad a Sushi restaurant is finally in Downtown Gilbert!"}
{"text":"We ordered surfer sushi roll and they bring a different sushi roll, after that it takes them 30 minutes to change it"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi rolls. The cowgirl and surfer are my favorites. The owner was friendly and offered to buy our first drink. The sushi is a bit more pricey than I would like but as long as it's happy hour I will continue to come by. Sushi is a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Expensive, but we enjoyed the best sushi we've had in Scottsdale.  The menu, too, is very extensive, and those you bring along who don't go wild about Japanese restaurants are sure to find other dishes to their liking."}
{"text":"I am here at least twice a week! I am very picky about my sushi and they hit the spot every single time. Waitresses are very nice and the meals are brought out very quickly after ordering. I have never had one complaint about their sushi but one of my favorite plates there is the valcano chicken. They have a great happy hour that i can normally leave for about $25 full! I love this place!!"}
{"text":"I am simply writing this review (and writing off this business) because the owner has discriminated against their employees for having tattoos. I am a heavily tattooed mother of two and a proven professional who has worked in the industry before. Any business who feels that they can fire multiple employees for having tattoos that not only are not offensive but that they were hired with is clearly living in a world beyond fairness and reality. OWNER, stop living in the past and stop discriminating against good people. It's the service industry, what do you expect?"}
{"text":"The sushi was really good. However as a number of other reviews state the service wasn't that great. It was crowded around dinner time so I assume it's a popular place.  They seem to have plenty of employees so I'm not sure why the service wasn't that good?"}
{"text":"Great sushi is hard to find in the desert, so 5 stars would be a bit of a stretch.  However, this is about as good as it comes in Phoenix; very fresh and flavorful. Try the surfer or crunchy rolls for a change of pace.   They seem to rotate drink menu frequently, but always make a good Moscow Mule.  Good happy hour with discounted speciality rolls.  Both locations: Indian School Rd and Scottsdale Rd are equally good.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The best sushi in the Arcadia area! My favorite is the surfer roll, cowboy roll, cowgirl roll, and the sashimi salad. Happy hour can get pretty busy but you can usually find a seat."}
{"text":"Happy hour: started with the Volcano Chicken appetizer. Basically, small bits of chicken in a buffalo wing sauce and a scoop of rice and a useless garnish. Not impressive at all. Glass of Pinot Noir for only $4, great deal. Next, Sashimi: we tried 4 different types of fish, 3 of the 4 tasted the same, as if the fish was either previously frozen or very low grade. Also, their \"sushi chefs\" need some more training in knife skills as the yellowtail had a couple of \"bits.\" And the fish portions were all inconsistent with slices of all different widths and lengths and were not very cold. For the same price of a plate of sashimi, I'll stick with my benchmark: Hiro in Scottsdale with Japanese chefs and the highest quality fish. Service was very good, except for our place setting missing soy sauce dishes that we had to nick from another table."}
{"text":"We are staying nearby and decided to stop here because it was close to our home base for the week.   First of all, when you open the front door, it is broken, so be careful you do not hit someone in the face with the door!  Second, when you walk in the music is so loud so that if you want to have a conversation, it would be best to sit right next to each other.  The sushi menu is in the tiniest font on the back of the sushi order sheet.  There is no organization to the list of sushi.   We ordered the special sashimi which was salmon.  The salmon had no flavor and was covered with marinated red onions.  We also had the spider roll and the alaskan roll along with a bottle of sake.  Our total came to $55.  Not worth it at all, will never be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this location last Saturday night and didn't receive the best service. When we arrived the hostess told us it would be a 30 min wait for a party of two, which wasn't bad considering it was a busy Sat night, however, there were multiple tables (probably 5-6) wide open. There were a couple two seated tables, multiple booths and a whole side wall empty! When we asked the hostess if the seats were reserved she proceeded to tell us that they don't reserve seats but that they couldn't seat us there because the servers were to busy and they wouldn't be able to give us good service. This did not sit well with me. Sitting and waiting 30+ minutes while there were tables available was far worse service than any server could have given us. I will not be going back to this location again."}
{"text":"I was staying next door at the Residence Inn and was told that this is a great place for Happy Hour. The food was delicious, prices were reasonable and service was fast. I was definitely happy to find this place during my stay! As a bonus, they had gluten free soy sauce!"}
{"text":"If you walk into a sushi bar and are overwhelmed by the smell of BBQ sauce and there is none on the menu, leave immediately. Unfortunately I failed to heed my own premonition and \"dined\" here. Don't do the same please...and save the money and gastrointestinal issues."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?! Best sushi in town! Try the cowboy roll or surfer roll."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been coming here for years. My go to local sushi spot. Great happy hour! Great priced rolls and drinks! Love this place! No it's not the best sushi in the world, but it's pretty damn good for what you get.Everything on  Happy Hour menu is excellent and great prices, only time I go."}
{"text":"Have to say one of my favorites for fast and good sushi.  Sit at the bar and be pampered by Mario and McKena and you are in for a treat.  The attention to detail, the amazing and sincere service, along with the fantastic sushi makes for a great experience.  Don't be afraid to ask for them......my favorites......cheers!!"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite, the servers were quick to welcome me and told me to have a seat where ever I would like. Everyone seems very friendly , was asked by multiple workers how I was and if everything was okay.  What I had was very good and came out at a decent time. Will be back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Surfer roll was good.  However, crab meat for other rolls was imitation crab.  Felt rubbery."}
{"text":"I do love to support smaller businesses, especially ones that do have great food! But this particular spot has awful awful service. The manager never seems like he cares and is always caught up in flirting with the servers  or on his phone. We saw staff doing jobs that were most likely not supposed to be there responsibility. I do keep giving them the Benefit of the doubt and give another chance but we are disappointed in the service and hospitality pretty much each time. So I did have to finally share."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice, staff were nice. Other than that naw.. imitation crab stix-no thank you ... 15 dollar sushi Rolls-really...  its to bad to bc the location is great and no other competition in old town. Maybe the next place will be good when this place goes out of business."}
{"text":"I love this place. The sushi is always fresh which initially surprised me being in the desert. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best sushi I have ever had! The Las Vegas roll and damn good roll are two of our favorites! They also have the best spicy garlic edamame! We try to hit happy hour, as the prices then are better for us! Definitely recommend... You will love it!"}
{"text":"I have been patronizing Sushi Brokers for years. When I have out of town guests Sushi Brokers is one of the restaurants on my list to take them to. In fact on September 16, 2017, I patronized Sushi Brokers along with a good friend of mine who was in town. I raved about the food here. My disclaimer was that the service is not great but the food is. Well no truer words were ever said. Sushi Brokers didn't disappoint. In fact it elevated it's bad customer service. There was a dish I had in 2015 that I wanted my friend to try. However, Emma told me \"You are confused.\" She further stated that she has worked at Sushi Brokers for 11 years (I believe she said). I was not at all pleased that she spoke to me in this manner, particularly in front of my out-of-town guest. However I weathered the storm. Then my friend asked Emma what was in a specialty drink that was on the chalkboard and Emma, who has worked at Sushi Brokers for 11 years, said she doesn't know...but she's worked there for 11 years. Then when the check came I began writing on my receipt. Emma, decided that she was going to speak to me although she wasn't spoken to. It was almost as if she sensed my dissatisfaction and so she said, with an attitude I might add, \"At least you weren't charged for the Miso Soup.\" Perhaps Emma needs a refresher of customer service in the restaurant industry. I don't need or appreciate the Help commenting To Me when I have not engaged her. The business that I provided to Sushi Brokers including family, friends and colleagues may not be a big deal to Emma but it may resonate in the pockets of the owner(s). I will never spend my money in this place again."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised after reading some of the other reviews posted here.  We arrived during happy hour and opted to sit at the bar which mostly open at the beginning but filled up as we were leaving.  Our service was great, no complaints at all.  Our server kept our drinks full and often checked in to see if we needed anything.  In addition, a lot of the servers worked together as a team so others checked in on us too.  We went with cowgirl & damn good rolls as well as yellowtail and salmon nigiri.  It was nice sitting at the bar because we could also see the sushi getting made. Both rolls were really good.  There was a pleasantly surprising amount of spice which was great as I usually feel that something described as spicy often isn't.  The nigiri was awesome.  I felt like the salmon was melting in my mouth. Everything was decently priced too, especially considering the area of this location.  I am looking forward to returning and trying some new things.  Why 4 stars instead of 5? Just taking it down one star as so many of the rolls seem to either be fried or contain a krab mix which I am not a fan of."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations.  The fish was very fresh the night we were there.  The bartender was great and the fish portions were bigger then average.  I enjoyed the sashimi a lot more then the sushi and the rolls.  The quality of fish seemed better on the sashimi.  I would go back."}
{"text":"We have been to the other location in North Scottsdale, but this one is closer to home.  We got here kinda of late around 8pm but the place still had people in there eating.  The look and atmosphere is a little different then the place up North.  This feels a little more like a bar then a restaurant but the Sushi bar is large and prominent in the space so that is what give it that feeling.  We order the chef's special sushimi and sushi plate.  The fish tasted really fresh and there was a nice assortment of fish.  We also ordered several rolls most of which we had eaten or tried before.  We didn't get a bad piece of fish on any thing we ate.  The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 was because I think there was only 1 waitress in the restaurant working all the tables and she was busy!  It would have been nice had she been a little more attentive  to our needs.  I would definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with co-workers. I almost cried when I got the bill because I was still hungry, but found myself forking over $15 for one roll. I tried the cowboy and the surfer (i think?). I'm pretty sure the surfer is the one with a bunch of crap splattered all over it. Apparently, it's really popular. I felt like I was eating soup! Good place to go for people who are new to sushi. My manager, who is afraid of sushi, liked what he had."}
{"text":"Being a sushi broker fan at the Scottsdale location I was really excited that one opened in Gilbert 2 miles from home. My experience with Sushi brokers was prompt service with high quality sushi. The New Gilbert store was definitely not prompt and I even had to go to the counter to get glasses , silverware , and check on my food orders . We are talking about 1 hr 45 min total time for dinner.   I consider myself a sushi purest and Gilbert is missing that. I don't typically order rolls. At SB unique things like toro and uni on the menu, this all looked great . So  I ordered both along with hamachi and maguro.   Apart from the very slow service, the Uni was fresh and creamy - very good. Then Wow, did the the sushi chefs even go to school for their craft ? The maguro had parts of a fin left in it, ok stuff happens .  But that's not all, then the Toro at $16 for nigiri at first looked great, but what I received in my order had cartilage within which was a huge disappointment. Note that  when you pay for toro one would expect pure culinary delight. How cartilage was even in toro grade sushi is beyond comprehension .  The hamachi I got at $6 each should be perfect, however , one piece had what looked like a tumor on it. I showed the manager Eric the unpleasant looking sushi and his first response was asking what was wrong with it? Really? Does management even know that sushi is not only food but art?   After my griping they did reduce my $190 bill , which was not my point or goal. But the experience compelled me to write a review .  So if you expect high end sushi this is not the place. You will pay high end prices though. Maybe if they work out their kinks I'll come back, but for right now I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great sushi joint. They were very accommodating to my off the menu request. I had one of the greatest servers ever, Kahili. She made great recommendations for items a little off beat. Loving the downtown Gilbert scene. Great planning."}
{"text":"Glad to have them in the neighborhood. The service is 5 stars. The sushi is 5 stars (lollypop sushi is exceptional). Ignore the other reviews as they just opened and some people of Gilbert are starting to act a little too snooty for their own good. Give them a chance it will be 5 stars for sure. There was another item they recommended that was so good but I cannot seem to remember."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. A sushi restaturant with average food would do well here just because of the killer location, but fortunately this SB nails it with a cool vibe, great music, a really cool bar....and AMAZING rolls. Try the Lollipop and the Hot Lips."}
{"text":"I have been to two of there locations now and I always have a good experience and the food is great but this time I sat at the bar and next thing I know a roach comes crawling by me. Then my coworker says look over there and it was a bigger roach flopping on its back. It was right next to the case were the fresh fish was. I will definitely not be coming back here. For how little people were in there ( maybe 3 tables) the counters were very dirty. It sucks because I like this place."}
{"text":"A trendy little spot in Arcadia. Sushi is amazing and has a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"The sushi is very good, I've been twice now and I'm a fan.  The Lollipop Roll is the roll to get here.   The Cowboy Roll is also tasty.  Another thing I was impressed with was the edamame.  Steamed perfectly and just the right amount of rock salt.     Also, the most important part of my review is that the hottest waitresses in Scottsdale work here.  Hands down."}
{"text":"More like a sushi club than a sushi bar. Nice ambiance, music is a bit loud. Not bad sushi but $35+tip doesn't get you very far. Friendly staff, very attentive. Absolutely try this Jasmine-green tea."}
{"text":"We were having a late dinner tonight because we needed to pick up kids after 11pm and my husband suggested we give Sushi Brokers another try. Well I wish I had read some of these recent review before hand or would have NEVER wasted our time and Money!!  We sat at the open Suchi bar @ 8:30 on a Saturday Night. After sitting awhile the Manager came from behind the Suchi  bar and pointed to one of the Suchi chefs  and said he is your sever. When we tried and failed several times to get his attention he did not speak To uus.  It was not very busy at this time and there were 4 servers/employees chatting in the corner which further frustrated us.  It was absolutely the WORSE service for mediocre food we've ever received.  We live in the north Scottsdale area and will NEVER return here again.   Too Many chances already!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi was mediocre at very very best. Felt like I'd been scammed when I left. Not one to usually complain about price at all as I can afford to pay for good food but honestly it was a rip! Girlfriend and I had 2 rolls off there \"specialty rolls\" section that were both $15 each. Fine if its good right? No...Sushi from any local sushi go around is better! I also never leave bad reviews (this is my first review) but felt it was right to warn everyone. All in all we spent $48 before tip on 2 rolls, girlfriend had a Kirin light and 2 hot sakes. Worth it? F no."}
{"text":"This place provided one of the worst and strangest experiences ever. Our party of 4 arrived at 530. We were barely acknowledged by Cassandra who never offered drinks or water. After about 15 minutes, I asked her for more then one menu(since we were a party of 4!). Since we never saw her again, someone else brought us 3 waters! I think it was a guy named Brian, but his role was never clear.  Four entrees were ordered, sushi not included. After a long time, only mine arrived. Needless to say, it was cold before the others arrived. However, my wife ordered brown rice, so we sent it back. Well, she never saw her dinner again! The other entrees finally came after soooo long, and were totally cold. So those were sent back and after a very long time, came back cold again!!  Needless to say, a total fiasco at this place. During this whole, long time, Cassandra was nowhere to be seen and seemed totally clueless and inattentive. Brian did most of the talking and serving and so I assumed he was a manager, since nobody showed up to apologize or introduce themselves as a manager.  To add to all these problems, the server who brought food could not be understood nor heard because the music was so loud.  What a HORRIBLE,WIERD EXPERIENCE."}
{"text":"Food always amazing, service was wonderful! The reason for the 3 Stars is because I didn't enjoy watching at gentlemen feeding his dog (not service, sitting in the seat next to him) from his plate."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time today during happy hour (everyday 3-6:30). They have so many rolls on the happy hour menu; not like majority of places that only have a few basic rolls. And the prices are really reasonable. My boyfriend and I got a bunch of great rolls off of the hh menu - favorite one was the Cowboy Roll. I seriously crave it on the reg. Sushi Brokers is definitely my new go-to sushi, it's awesome."}
{"text":"I've been to the N. Scottsdale location and the service was much better. Possibly growing pains at the Gilbert location? Waited 10 minutes before our server arrived...We were ready to order...Food came out one at a time, not together, odd. Sushi was on point and tasted good. Calamari was probably the worst I've had. Drinks were good."}
{"text":"Service: Could have been better. We were left alone for long periods of time and only saw our actual server 3 times out of the 8 or so visits. Food: Disappointing. We tried a variety of rolls and found the portions to be small and the taste to be mediocre. We ended up getting dessert because of the small portions and we were fairly pleased.  Price: High. We were there during happy hour so it wasn't that bad ($4 for eight very small rolls), but I wouldn't be happy spending twice that during regular hours when there are better, larger portions at other sushi joints. The desserts were the best part of our meal, but not worth the $7 for a little ice cream and fried apples. Appearance/Location: It is a good looking place in North Scottsdale. The music was way too loud, which some people may like, but I enjoy conversation over dinner.  Bottom Line: Generally I find small Scottsdale restaurants disappointing and this was no exception. I don't plan to go back."}
{"text":"I went to Sushi Brokers for Happy Hour. I ordered 2 rolls and an appetizer, and my total was still under $15- an amazing deal! The calamari was delicious. My rolls were all right, but I think it was an error on my part ordering rolls that I had never tried before. Our waitress was super sweet, and really fast. Overall, I'd be happy to come back here."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a hip place, with good drinks, great service, and sushi on the side, this is it.  Ended up spending $85 on mediocre sushi.  You can see from the photo that the spicy salmon roll was very uninspiring with very little salmon.  Rest of the food was OK.  If you are looking for great sushi, there are many other places in town that will be better and also less expensive.  My wife and I left unsatisfied and may be back for a drink but not sushi."}
{"text":"I had so many ppl tell me Sushi Brokers would be a gr8 place to eat sushi at, especially having lived in Japan in for so long.  I believe Hiro Sushi, & have yet to find a find another place that can match them.   When we walked in, the loud, hellish music reminded me of RA - I hate RA & their wanna ambience.  Strike 1 against Sushi Brokers. The waitress was more intent on making a good impression with my boyfriend, who was wearing his \"Retired from the Air Force\" polo than she was in addressing me.  DEFINITELY STRIKE 2.  I was happy to sign the check AND leave her a $.01 tip in her hand.  Yes, I walked up to her and personally delivered it. The fish was SPOILED. To the owners - if you don't know how to keep your fish at the right temperature, learn, and quickly.  Your fish tastes horrible."}
{"text":"We liked this location even more than the one in Scottsdale.  GREAT service and food.  So happy they finally opened:)"}
{"text":"Not only is the food excellent but the service is outstanding as well. All of the employees are friendly and helpful, especially Misty. Misty has gone out of her way to make sure that we are happy and since out first visit here 6 months ago we now come weekly...literally every week. We enjoy the happy hour,the quality of food, and the service kicks ass. Especially Misty and also Mike are the type of employees I would want  representing my establishment. Perfect."}
{"text":"Great service and I love their rolls... the damn good is damn amazing... if you want good sushi with a twist this is your place!!"}
{"text":"This was our third or fourth time eating here and I would say that the sushi is pretty good. I do however think that they are a bit expensive unless you can get the happy hour menu.  I think they could expand their menu a little bit more as well.  Our waitress was a little pushy but I would rather her be in our face then us not be able to find her at all."}
{"text":"We love Sushi Brokers!!! We head here for lunch or after work drinks at least once a week. My favorite for lunch is the specialty bento box with the cowboy roll. Their green tea is delicious as well as the spicy edamame! Service is great and everyone is wonderful."}
{"text":"I was a little surprised by the negative reviews but as I read them it made me realize, maybe Sushi Brokers doesn't have the greatest service. I guess I never noticed because I always go for happy hour and am really looking forward to the Diamondback roll and a few Saki Bombs. That being said the service isn't really that bad.  The prices are good for happy hour and are actually a little high regularly. I enjoy the atmosphere and they usually have ESPN on the couple of plasmas scattered around.   The ideal night would be start at Sushi Brokers for a few rolls and saki during happy hour then get on with your plans for the rest of the evening."}
{"text":"User friendly. Very clean.   Restrooms clean.   Don't like the house music.  Quick friendly service."}
{"text":"Having just had sushi the day before, we decided to each try the hamburger, requesting and making a big deal about there being no pink in the middle. When the burgers arrived, they weren't just pink, they were RED in the center. We commented to each other and the manager must have seen our reactions because just seconds later he showed up at our table and said he would cover our meals because they weren't as ordered and we didn't have time to fix the order (tight lunchtime). We were beyond amazed. He charged us for NOTHING and the burgers were good, excepting the middle. The way they supported their waitress and took care of us earned them 5 stars for service and another chance! Plus I love the airy, industrial interior :)"}
{"text":"Usually drop in to this sushi restaurant when in Phoenix.  Staff is always friendly and the sushi is very good.  Tonight a little conundrum white.  Then ordered a number of rolls and sashimi was excellent.  The Diamondback roll and soft shell crab were excellent and the spicy tuna was good ( prefer chopped rather than smashed tuna).  Overall 3.5"}
{"text":"I've read a lot of Good review about this place. I am not a sushi snob by any means but the sushi I had for lunch here was terrible. The salmon was plastic looking and dryish. The tuna had the consistency of an oyster and there was just enough rice to cover the paper. Maybe we ha a bad chef this day or something. But it was not worth the price. Out server also left drinks empty and hardly checked on us. We had to walk our check the the hostess stand to pay."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Sushi.   Food is fresh and always great.  They have a good happy hour and many of the signature rolls are offered at a great price  The only negative is the music is loud  that can also be fun but if you are there to have conversations go early"}
{"text":"I took a friend from out of town here there because I've really had great experiences here so far and we both love sushi...   Of course the place had to embarrass me...our waitress was spacey and snotty, the wrong rolls came out, and the dudes next to us were so obnoxious and rude that they ended up buying our meal because they \"felt bad.\"  I'm so disappointed in you, Sushi Brokers!"}
{"text":"Tried some new sushi today (Damn Good and Diamondback) both were amazing. This was my first time coming to sushi brokers in Gilbert. I have been to the one in Scottsdale and I can say Sushi Brokers is one of my all time favorite sushi restaurants"}
{"text":"What happened to this place???  Sushi Brokers used to (when I say used to, I mean a few years ago) be our go-to sushi spot and has now gone downhill to the point that the sushi is not even edible anymore.  We stopped going there regularly but would stop in on occasion to see if there had been any improvement only to find even poorer quality sushi.     Our last experience there will definitely be the last time that we ever set foot into this place.  We ordered some yellowtail sushi and the lollipop, cowboy, and summer rolls, although we received a surfer roll instead of the summer.  None of the sushi was the slightest bit fresh and the shrimp dynamite that came on top of the surfer roll was filled with crunchy bits of tail and shells.  The lollipop roll, which used to be our favorite, tasted so fishy and disgusting that we couldn't even eat it and we left afraid that we would end up with food poisoning from the rotten fish.  I would rather eat sushi from a grocery store than Sushi Brokers (and I can't stand grocery store sushi!).  It really is a shame to see what used to be a good place turn into such an all around disaster. If you're looking to try a new sushi restaurant, you'd be better off at just about anywhere else than here."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a recommendation from someone at the Camelback Golf Course. Being from Atlanta and someone who eats a lot of sushi I was somewhat skeptical as you always want the fish to be fresh.   Not only was the fish fresh, but the service was fantastic!  Ask for Suzi at lunch. She was amazing.   We had a lot of tuna, salmon, and yellowtail nigiri and all was fresh. Great sushi rice. Very cool atmosphere. The spicy edamame was out of this world."}
{"text":"One step above grocery sushi. Nothing about this restaurant makes it stand out. Nothing authentic. Won't last much longer."}
{"text":"Sushi Brokers is a great place for happy hour.  Myself and my friends always find ourselves here.  They have TV's in every direction to watch whatever game is on and great contemporary music keeping the place exciting.  You definitely want to make sure you get here as early as possible, because the seats fill up quickly.  The nice thing about their happy hour menu is just about every roll is on it.  You get a solid selection to choose from ranging from $4 to like $16.    The Lollipop Roll  is by far my favorite.  Its assorted fresh fish, shrimp, avocado, and spicy krab mix rolled in cucumber and topped with masago, siracha and ponzu! MMMM  It's fun because each piece actually comes on a stick so you can eat it like a lollipop.  It's a great summer roll, both refreshing and spicy at the same time."}
{"text":"The food was super yummy! Our server was nice and new the menu. The food did take a long time to get but we'll worth it. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sushi Brokers is good sushi that hits the spot.  Service is always good and the sushi itslef, pretty fresh.  Nothing that melts in your mouth but its good.  Only earning 3 stars, the sushi is pricey.  I dont believe that it's worth the money spent, even in No. Scottsdale but I will definitely be back.  Note during happy hour, the nigiri pieces are only 1 per order.  Lollipop roll = YUM!"}
{"text":"We went to this place a few minutes before 10pm but we were never informed of their reverse happy hour... we ordered their sashimi chef's choice but we're not truly satisfied with it, they were cut too thin, the rolls we ordered were not exceptional in taste, we've had better rolls and bigger serving, in other words we paid the full price but thought that we probably could have more of our moneys worth if we went to another sushi place. Although the place can be cozy, the service was so so, they were friendly but they were quicker in clearing your table rather than getting your order..."}
{"text":"Please order the yummy roll and the cowgirl. You will be extremely happy you tried them. I don't like fried rolls and I love the taste of something fresh and citrusy. I especially love the amazing lunch specials during the week .. a bento box with a miso soup, your choice of roll, rice, veggies, cucumber salad, and even half an orange. I hope this special never goes away!!"}
{"text":"Only reason this place gets a two is because I enjoy the quality of the food. The service.. Not so much. Let's see what each star I took off is for. 1 one taken off since the waitress just comes and drops the check in front of me and didn't even ask if we wanted dessert.... Like ok. Forget that I wanted that fried ice cream.:. Another one is taken off since the last time I was here my friend and I split the check... Waitress snatched it after we placed the tip and made us feel like a burden when we were sitting down to chat for a little longer.. Only to find that they charged an extra five bucks for the tip to the wrong card... Last time I checked, that's illegal. And a last star taken off because the seating arrangements are terrible. And the hostess as the front door was rude. Don't hire 15 year olds that barely know how to speak. Since I like the sushi, I guess I'll go to a new location. And they change light bulbs in the middle of dinner here. Nice."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, first SB experience.    Pretty darn good. We even mixed it up and went away from the usual rice laden rolls and did a sushi salad which was amazing. We also had the lollipop roll wrapped in cucumber - super clean, healthy and tasty too.  In fact I'm gonna ask Chipotle to wrap my next burrito in cucumber. Lettuce wraps were solid but nothing new. Overall great food.   As for the vibe and such, it was pretty loud with the music.. kind of like the RA style. The inside is a shiny black painted brick with white window blinds, so it's an unusual look."}
{"text":"Seriously have never had a bad experience and I've been here at least 75 times. When to go: Lunch or Reverse Happy Hour What to get: Sapporo & Sake, Surfer, Tootsie, Hot Lips, and fresh sashimi.  The Sashimi Salad is REALLY good too."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents during happy hour last Sunday. It is a nice place, with comfy booths. Big bar as well.  The happy hour selection was great, however, most of the options had something spicy involved- spicy tuna, spicy sauce, etc. I loved that, but my mom can't tolerate most spicy foods so we were a bit limited on our selections.  The rest of the menu was great, plenty of options for the non-sushi goer. My dad actually got the sushi burger which has no fish in it at all. They also offered some standard dishes like beef and broccoli and teriyaki chicken.  The happy hour prices were good for sushi and the entrees were reasonably priced. Did not take advantage of any drinks on this visit, but hope to do so in the future."}
{"text":"I need to have gluten free options and Sushi Brokers has great options!  Waited till we visited several times to be sure they understand gluten free and they have been spot on every time.  The lunch specials do not work for gluten free, but anyone I've taken for lunch really enjoy them.    They have happy hour every day from 3 pm - 6:30 p.m and reverse Mon - Sat 10 pm - close.  They have great atmosphere with lots of windows to see outside.  The restaurant is kept very clean.  Every roll and lunch special we have tried has been very good.  They even have excellent ice tea.  The service has always been excellent.  They are definitely hidden from the street, but the free parking garage is adjacent to them so it's all very easy.  Will definitely return and recommend them."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour on a Saturday around 6pm and it was quite busy; we got one of the last free tables left. The happy hour is rather extensive. It has most of the sushi and rolls with average 1-2 dollars off. But many of their rolls are just variations of california and tempura rolls. In terms of freshness of the fish, roll execution, the sushi quality is slightly above average. But even with happy hour prices and only a few pieces of nigiri and rolls, we still spent about $60 for two. For that money, I can name MANY other sushi places in the area with better food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places The cowboy and cowgirl rolls are my favorite!  Good service especially right at the bar!"}
{"text":"Oh, Sushi Brokers...what happened to you?! This used to be my go-to place for great ambience and delish sushi.  We ate there Friday night for the first time in a long time and they have significantly raised their prices and the sushi was subpar at best! $90 for 3 rolls and 3 cocktails. Grrrr....frustrating!"}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the understated sign and the repurposed Pizza Hut architecture. This is a very good sushi restaurant that has never disappointed us. The staff are relaxed and friendly and the food is prepared fresh and right in front of you if you choose to sit at the bar. Their Happy hour is a great bargain and has the same great food without the prime time wait. Stop by several times to try all their specialty rolls. They are all good!"}
{"text":"The first time I went with a friend, the food and the service was good, but the sushi is a bit over priced, so we ordered the bento box, not bad and nice size for the lunch portion.  Since i got pretty good 1st impression about this restaurant, so i decided to go there again.  The second time I went there with my wife and my 1 yr old baby for lunch.  Same as first time, the server tell us to seat wherever we want, but I looked around, they have all high table, high bar table, even the lower table are raised.  I asked the server if they have a high-chair for my baby and they said No!  Really?!  We end up to leave the restaurant and eat somewhere else.  No high-chair means can't dining with infant, no regular table means not accessible for people with wheelchair.  I just can't believe now a day still have a restaurant that doesn't have the equal dining experience for all people....not comply with ADA means pending to get sue!  Hope they could correct / improve these issues...  Third try...ordered teriyaki chicken bento, I am not sure am I eating chicken or pork, that pieces of meat so dry, tough and salty!  The stir fried veggie also very salty and the rice is cold and hard!  I only ate a little bit then can't eat any more, besides the orange, the other food just not eitable.  Decided not to come anymore, wasted my money....and the way they prepare the food, it is totally wasting it.  They should try their own food before serve it to the customers!  Terrible!!!"}
{"text":"I came in with 5 friends and the waitress had a very condescending tone with us. We were about to order when all of as sudden she said she can't split the check individually. At this point we just left because I have never been treated this poorly by a waitress in my life. Definitely don't recommend. I recommend pure sushi a couple miles away. Me and my buddies had a splendid time there"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  Great spicy tuna rolls!  and AWESOME happy hours!  Great ambience and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible sushi here they served me brown salmon and I just wanted to get out of there the service was slow and I probably will never come back here again definitely not impressed by anything this restaurant has to offer."}
{"text":"Sushi brokers is hands down my favorite go to sushi spot in downtown Gilbert. The staff is super friendly and very attentive! The food is always so amazing. My favorites are The Surfer Roll, shrimp fried rice and the spicy garlic edamame just to name a few! You can't go wrong with anything on their menu quite honestly! The drinks are great too, I recommend the Tokyo Colada! The owner is always there and makes his patrons feel welcomed and taken care of. Thank you for always providing a great atmosphere and even better food! Keep up the great work SB!!"}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite place to get sushi !!!! We always hit the happy hour when we go for low prices and the great food. If your a fan of blue moon beer like I am they have the 20 oz bottles . It's definitely one of our top places to go for date night and a great time."}
{"text":"We had 2 different salads...one with seared tuna and one with tuna, salmon, and yellow tail... Both were super fresh and delicious!   The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they don't have any sauces that are gluten free :( They only had gf soy sauce, so my salad wasn't as good as it could have been. Please get GF sauces!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! We had a few things on their happy hour menu and a few rolls that weren't, all of which we would order again! Didn't have anything from the bar this time but they had a great wine selection! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We cannot wait to go back again. Love the set up of the restaurant. Amazing happy hour prices. Our server was Emily, who was an absolute joy to be around and made sure we always had water. I let them know I was in a hurry (as usual). The food came out almost immediately and the sushi chef was friendly. The Tootsie roll was INCREDIBLE & the Vegas roll was delicious. I honestly could not ask for better service, atmosphere, food, and happy hour prices!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's loud.  However, for being landlocked the sushi was fresh and tasty.  I was in town on business and was put up across the street.  I visited this place twice.. yes twice, because I was so happy with the service, the beer, but most of all THE SUSHI...  I really enjoyed some of their specialty pieces.  It's worth giving it a shot, and I will go back next time I'm in town.."}
{"text":"Been here a few times before. Food is always good and the service has been all but once. It's kinda spendy, so we checked yelp for other sushi places nearby, but they had negative reviews on the food and the prices were about the same, so we stuck with our usual.  This time, we tried the pineapple rolls. I really liked them. They have a spicy kick to them and the pineapple sauce was delish! Seemed more like a pineapple salsa than sauce, because it was chunky.   We also had the Uppercut wine, which tasted much better than it smelled lol. And we had California rolls. We both left full and the bill was $51 including tax and tip, so overall not bad. I like this spot."}
{"text":"Wow! Super impressed with the quality of the sushi I ordered and the price! I went to the Camelback location and the service was prompt and the staff was very friendly! Definitely recommend to fellow sushi lovers! :)"}
{"text":"I love sushi... but I'm pretty sure I won't be coming back here by myself.  Happy hour has decent prices, and the sushi is alright. Some rolls were better made than others, and it seems to me the quality was inconsistent.  Based on food alone, I'd give it three stars, but the service was mediocre. We asked for waters, and that took our waitress ten minutes to retrieve. We asked for a couple minutes to look over the menu, but our waitress didn't even return for over twenty minutes!!! It's ridiculous, our food would have been served by now at plenty of other places.   It gets worse. Seven of us ordered regular rolls, and one ordered hers tempura style. We also got an order of tempura vegetables. Those came out five minutes after we ordered, which was nice, and the tempura roll that my friend ordered came out shortly after. Everything else... came 35 minutes later. I timed it just because how ridiculous it was - everything was devoured, and only half of us got refills once! Yes it's nice to serve the same style rolls at the same time, but such a huge difference is inexcusable. At the very least they should have delayed my friend's tempura roll (and she agrees!).  This place advertises ambience as it's selling point, but it was average. There was only ONE table in the entire restaurant that could seat more than four people! Ambience if useless if it isn't practical.  I'm never voting to come here again, even if my sushi were free."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in around 4 on a Saturday and just in time for happy hour!  They had a lot of options for HH and great specials!  We tried out the crab rangoon, California roll, Damn Good roll, cowgirl roll, and chicken wok bowl with noodles. I loved everything except for the wok bowl which was a little too saucy for my liking.  The rolls were fresh and super tasty. I will probably keep our visits to HH as the normal prices seemed high. Our server was also awesome and super attentive. Looking forward to our next visit to try out some different rolls!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the last month and will keep going back. First visit my friend and I both ordered the sushi bento box. Nice and simple California rolls, miso soup, and sashimi. We also ordered the Las Vegas (can't remember what is in it but its tempura fried and  incredible). Second visit was on New Years Day. I was a little worried the staff and chefs would be off their game due to the holiday, but nope, still excellent. My only complaint is the seating. Cramped booths or high stools. I have an iffy back and scooting into a booth or having to climb a chair (I'm also just plain short) is difficult. I'd like some standard chairs where I can just sit."}
{"text":"Sushi here is ok. The restaurant itself is really nice and love the decor. They have a happy hour menu which is pretty good but otherwise it's a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner and instantly fell in love... I came here during happy hour (3 - 6:30pm) and the prices were reasonable. Sushi was delicious. Good service."}
{"text":"Going off price, quality, wait time, general service and the overwhelming scent of the waitresses perfume, I have to give my one and only one star rating.    :(."}
{"text":"I found ants in my drink (when it was nearly gone) and they took a whopping 2.70 off of my meal. I've been coming here numerous times for their miso salmon, but it makes me scared to drink anything here."}
{"text":"I'm always impressed when a landlocked state has good sushi, and this place did. Since it was a Monday during happy hour, it was a bit quieter and the service was prompt.   The 5 of us tried a variety of items (from the Tuna to the Cowgirl) and everything was very fresh.  We also enjoyed some bomber beers and cocktails that were $2.00 off. Overall, we had a great experience.  I would definitely go again at happy hour, next time we visit.  Our sushi, a Kobe burger, and drinks came to $140.00, before tip.  Not bad for the amount of sushi we ordered."}
{"text":"This is a little sushi gem in Arcadia. At first i was a little thrown off by the name. Once you try it, it will keep you coming back. Their specialty rolls are creative and mouth watering. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for some great sushi and saki!"}
{"text":"I love their happy hour: decent prices for decent sushi (and apps and booze!) We have had terrible service and sketchy fish once (on separate instances) out of the half a dozen times we have been in there, but typically it satisfies the cravings. I suppose they specialize in those fancy rolls, but 98% of them contain cooked fish or imitation crab, neither of which I am a fan of.  It gets very loud in there, but they have plenty of televisions broadcasting sports which keeps the hubs happy."}
{"text":"Been here beforea few years usually a good experience. Went 8/4 for lunch. 40 mins to get a rainbow roll bento box that was fair at best. Prices went up too. Looks like I'll be heading to RA when I'm in that area."}
{"text":"This place never disappoint me, staff are always friendly. It is the most restaurant I've ever been to, I think they all know me there. We always order the same things and few new things but the rolls we always order are: Crunchy, Las Vegas, Philly, Damn Good, Spicy Tuna, Surfer & Cowgirl.  Happy hour is worth it, they have reverse hh from 10pm till close."}
{"text":"Kid-friendly my A$$! They said they had no high chairs or booster seats. My husband and 1.5 year old walked right out."}
{"text":"Basic sushi place. Not great. Not bad. It took more than 20 mins to get our check after asking 2 times. It was lunch time on a weekday and maybe 2 other groups. We sat at the sushi bar and one of the chefs was nice enough. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Service is bad, it took lieratly 20 min ro get 2 orders of rolls, the server didn't show up to until I complained  Rolls are Great!"}
{"text":"A definite meh. We live nearby and had been excited for them to open, but gave them some time to shake of the New Place Bugs. I guess they need a lot longer.  The staff was friendly, but didn't seem to know what was going on. Nearly every question resulted in a run to the kitchen to ask, and then we had to flag them down again to get the answer.  Lots of options, especially if you're a fan of sushi rolls. They seem to really like tempura, as we went six rolls in a row asking \"What's that one?\" and finding out it had fried shrimp in it. Does anything scream tasty raw fish like rampant deep frying?  Food came fairly quickly, and tasted okay, but then we had two more bouts of misheard requests from our server and it had passed from silly to annoying by that point. We had one regular roll, one mid-range roll from their list, and one of their top end rolls. I'm trying to recall the exact names, but I can't, which I guess tells you how memorable they were.  And I have no idea why the place still looks like a Pizza Hut. Just not the kind of place I want to relax in and enjoy some sushi.  Not horrible, just not that special. I'd almost prefer a chain like Ra over them. If you really want great sushi, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Recently attempted Friday happy hour here, and we failed. We met up a little bit before 6 pm but by the time we were seated it was 6:45.. OUCH. But regardless, the food was great. We ended up just sticking with sushi. The server recommended the lollipop roll. It's wrapped with cucumber instead of rice and it was delicious! We also had the calamari appetizer and a variety of other rools with iced green tea. Our total bill for 4 people was $91. WHOA.  It's definitely worth another visit though, but I would recommend coming way earlier to ensure HH prices. The music is good, albeit a tad loud."}
{"text":"Man do I love this place. Always a great time. The service used to be so meh so I didn't come for awhile but they really stepped up the game. The food is great and the servers are always good now. The happy hour is dope and it's everyday! Can't beat that! I love the sushi so much, but the apps are good. I know it's a sushi place but get the volcano chicken. It's so damn good.  Oh and speaking of damn good, get the sushi roll called damn roll. Oh and the diamondback. Mmmm. I love everything  I've had hear and they found a usual customer."}
{"text":"Awesome Happy Hour experience!   The place was busy and the Friday Happy Hour vibe was great. We didn't have reservations, but were greeted with a smile and quickly seated. After a couple of bad experiences in the same complex at Clever Koi and Grubstack, we noticed the staff at Sushi Brokers all smiled and seemed happy to be there.  Our server, Kylie was wonderful!  She was so nice and her smile was infectious!  Oh yes, and the sushi and cocktails were very good! We live in Gilbert and will be back!  Great job Sushi Brokers!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent appetizers and awesome happy hour prices! Nothing better than an upbeat atmosphere, happy staff, and a huge beer to start a weekend! The tuna (sashimi, sushi, or roll) was very fresh, best we've had since we were in Japan! Cowboy and Cowgirl rolls are very good, and we loved the Volcano Chicken appetizer."}
{"text":"So disappointed.... smallest cuts of happy hour Nigiri I've ever seen in my life.... it was kind of funny actually."}
{"text":"I met the owner one night since I was his Lyft driver. He mentioned a meal to try and I ended up going the next night.  We both enjoyed the meal. Casual place even though we were dressed up.  Price was fine.  We will go back again."}
{"text":"Happy Hour here is an actual joke. There should be rules about fair happy hour prices because anybody can say it's happy hour, but do you really mean it you sleazy restaurant owners. Yeah the Long Island ice tea is $4, but after I mention that the thing has no alcohol in it, waitress admits that they use a pre-made mix. Very expensive drinks and beers only garner a $2 discount and the worst items on the food menu seem to be discounted most, like Tempura crap and endamme. I don't even eat Sushi, but my very \"scottsdaleish\" date did and she ate a $15 roll for Happy Hour!  Yes, she is a golddigger, but even that roll should be discounted.  I suppose I could write it off as Scottsdale pricing, but not for Happy Hour. No 2nd date and no return to this establishment. Oh, our waitress was nice, would have must rather been on a date with her."}
{"text":"Wife and I came here last night. We normally go to Masa Sushi, but when we went there, we weren't greeted, and no one even acknowledged us for the 5+ minutes we stood by the \"wait to be seated\" sign. Out we go, sorry. Decided to head down to this fine establishment. While parking can be annoying, even with the parking garage, we arrived there with little fuss. Soon entry, we were greeted with smiles by not one, not two, but 3 different employees!! We were promptly seated, at a small, though cozy table. Issue with the table was it rocked back and forth pretty bad.  We looked at their menu, standard affair, a check box filled long piece of heavy card stock type paper. Check off the sushi roll(s) you want. Easy. It would be nice to have a normal menu, so when your looking at the menu, your significant other doesn't have to try and read it upside down.  We both ordered ice tea, and skipped on the pre meal goodies. We dove right into the sushi. We got the Philly, the Damn Good, the Las Vegas, and the Outlaw. The Damn Good, is just as the title states. It will be our go to roll next time we show up. Oh, the iced tea isn't standard iced tea. It's a sort of berry flavored iced tea. While yummy, we both weren't expecting anything other than standard, so it kind of shocked our tongues for a second.  Service was great, food was great, thanks for giving us a viable alternative to our go to sushi. You may have just earned our repeated business."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I like coming here for happy hour sushi. They have happy hour everyday for 3-6 and reverse happy hour from 10pm-close.  First off, the restaurant has a cool, hip vibe with good music playing in the background. As for the food, the sushi is consistently good and fresh.  Our 2 favorite rolls are the \"lollipop\" roll and \"surfer\" roll which are both on the happy hour menu. The lollipop roll is a cucumber wrapped roll with tuna and the surfer roll is topped with shrimp dynamite.  Besides the good sushi, this place has great service. Everything from our two servers, Aaron and Will, going above and beyond to ensure that we were well taken care of, to the manager periodically checking up on us as well. Very personable and knowledgeable of the menu. These are reasons why we continue to come back for happy hour sushi."}
{"text":"We had a great experience tonight at Sushi Brokers. My husband I opted to stay at the bar seating and enjoyed the delicious chimichanga roll (ordered 2 of them it was so good!) and great drinks made by our awesome bartender David!  David was truly the reason we declined moving to a table, as we were getting excellent service from him at the bar area. He was very friendly and helpful and got my husband hooked on a new delicious cocktail too! He told us about their M-F daily happy hour so we will be going back soon!!!!  Thanks much!"}
{"text":"Love this place for afternoon snack and a beer. Staff is always friendly and it's never to crowder at the bar mid day. No great HH deals but great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been visiting this place for years. I stopped once I ate some bad tuna and swore off sushi for at least a year after.   It's overpriced, not fresh and I plan on never returning.   Save some $$ and maybe a night of dry heaves and check out the sushi restaurant across the street.   If you're looking for a flashy, overpriced place with great ambiance, this is for you."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for the first time a few months ago, but it must have been around the time that service sucked because I was disgusted with our server and vowed to never return.   We decided to try it again today for lunch, and boy was this time better! I feel like the owner realized that his waitresses were shitty so he found replacements. He also made it a point to stop in and greet everyone at the restaurant which I thought was really nice.  We sat at the bar and service was fantastic. If our server wasn't around, another waitress would even ask if we were doing okay.  As for the food - I have officially given up on RA and moved here because this place was just great! We had the lunch boxes that come with miso soup, cucumber salad, wokked veggies, rice, and your choice of a main dish (regular meat plates or a choice of a specialty roll). We went with the Las Vegas rolls. You get all of that food for $15 and walk out of there feeling full."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my girlfriend for the first time. It was a nice cool night outside and was disappointed to hear there was no patio. The inside bar was really nice but the decor was half way decent, best part of Sunday was that they have happy hour all day! I had one of the best sushi rolls and is definitely better than RA's sushi. Staff was very nice as well."}
{"text":"Went here with my sister last night, it is across the street from her apartment so we wanted to love it, sadly we were disappointed. The fish did not taste very fresh, the edamame was not cooked very well and had way too much chili sauce, lastly our server was not very attentive. I am sad to say I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Gotta first say THANK YOU to ERIN!!  She rocked the house down with taking such great care of our team!!  She was able to split our tabs like it was no worries!!   Sushi Brokers is a nice hip, sushi house!  Their drinks here were amazing, especially.... during their Happy Hour!!  Their sushi prices also during that time were very reasonable so I decided to splurge a bit and double my orders.  However, in terms of sushi, it wasn't too bad but nothing to write home about either.  I did enjoy my beer though especially at the Happy Hour discounted price!!  Best part about SB, their service here was impeccable and fast!  Thank you ERIN for your awesome smile and excellent service!!  Until then, be kind to one another and Cheers! ~ :p"}
{"text":"Unless you like dirty towels being used to wipe the cutting board, avoid this place.  Came in late, received below standard service for a bar, and watched the sushi chef.  During my visit, the chef did not use gloves, used a damp towel, not soaking in food grade sanitizer.  Decides to wipe board, and proceeds to dampen the towel in the sink next to him.  Repeats process throughout night.  For anyone that understands food safety, you need to dampen this \"cleaning and wiping towel\" in sanitizer.   There were a few other strange occurrences that happened in the restaurant, including a guy threatening to shoot up the place because his wallet was missing.  He later found it in his car.    All the neurotoxins and shigella probably clouded his way memory."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi in town. They have all the old standard, but their specialty rolls are top tier. If you are with a group, you have to try the sushi pizza. Keep an open mind with this place and explore. You will be amazed at the flavors.   Happy times. Give it a try. You won't regret it. Oh, btw, the happy hour is a heck I a good deal."}
{"text":"Fast service, came during happy hour on a Friday night. If you love tuna or spicy tuna, the Cowboy roll and Diamondback rolls were amazing! We also got spicy edamame as an appy"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Phoenix. Period. Get the Surfer & Damn Good... You will thank me later. They are amazing."}
{"text":"Despite the fact we are in a land locked state, one might give pause to sushi given the theatrics involved in getting fresh fish here. One bad turn and you got yourself an intestine-clearing incident. Not so here. Fresh, good, outstanding. I would eat this sushi at any time. The place smells clean, which i mention this because a few PHX sushi places smell exactly like that, sushi places. If the fishy smells, well, my friends, don't eat it. There was a now defunct place on camelback and 24th street, i forget its name, but holy god, that place smelled of Calcutta fish market. No wonder it closed. Enough about them, go to Sushi Brokers, you wont regret a single roll. The crunchy? petit mort dans la bouche."}
{"text":"Happy hour every day!!!  Had An amazing time. The atmosphere was fun, the sushi was delicious. You should try the surfer roll, we loved it. I would go back."}
{"text":"yummy happy hour and such great service!  I wish the happy hour had a little better specials for Nigeri and wine however the sushi was fresh and delish!!!"}
{"text":"Service was top notch; Waitress was really attentive.  Interesting atmosphere mix of sportsbar and Japanese food.  Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I've had better caterpillar rolls in hometown California.  Otherwise great experience all around."}
{"text":"Service: was low par. I could tell the girl hates her job. Sushi: Do not come to this place if you really want sushi. I could have gotten cheaper sushi/sashimi from Safeway or any pre-made sushi/sashimi places with same quality. Now if you just want to drink beer, they have a nice restaurant and outside seatings for that. If your purpose is to eat some sushi, I do not recommend here. Go somewhere else.  I have been to Japan, and for whoever even think of opening and serving this type of sushi is such a disgrace to the dish."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Arcadia. Finally checked this place out last week after hearing for years how good the Scottsdale location is. Sushi Brokers lived up to its rep. The Hot Lips roll is the best roll I've ever had anywhere.  The wine by the glass selections were decent and my friend said his blood orange margarita reminded him of his trip to Rocky Point the weekend before.   4 starts instead of 5 because it was fairly loud inside when the restaurant when it was full and we had some slight service issues. Overall, the best bet for great sushi in the area."}
{"text":"For awhile I thought Sushi Brokers was falling off the map. My last two visits completely changed my perspective. The quality of the sushi made now is on point. They have a new sashimi dish where they add cilantro, jalapeños, serreno' s, and ponzu sauce. They wrap the fish around a piece of avocado and dress the rest on top of the fish. OMG! Out of this world good. The fish is clean and really fresh! The prices are fair. Welcome back SUSHI BROKERS!!! Next time I go I will post some new pictures for everyone to look at. Try the shrimp tempera roll, amazing!! They are using  what seems to be a new lighter batter. Go give this place a try you will not be let down!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were excited to find a sushi restaurant close to our work - so we went there to have lunch the other day. We both ordered sushi lunch - about $11 or so - comes with miso soup, tiny salad, 3 pcs of nigiri and California roll. We don't like California roll so we asked the server if we could get tuna roll instead with additional $.  First of all, the server did not tell us how much the additional cost for the substitute, then they just added the cost of an order of tuna nigiri ($6.50) for two lunches. I think it's a bit too expensive from California roll to tuna roll substitution ($3.25 each up). We could have just kept the original California roll and order the tuna nigiri additionally for the same price. Each of us ended up paying over $17 for soup, tiny salad, 3 pcs of nigiri and tuna roll with tip. We didn't even get full. Food was ok but ... just OVERPRICED!  The atmosphere was good but ... It was my first and last time there."}
{"text":"It has been about 3 years since I last visited and it took me this long and a few people to say good things about them before I could return. My last visit was reminiscent of cheaply made sushi and bland food. The green tea fried ice cream was terrible.  Just last Sunday I had a wonderful experience and the place was nearly packed to full capacity. The happy hour had a few great items and they also have specials that are written on the boards. The atmosphere was cozy and relaxing.  Dont miss the surf sushi or the lollipop. I'll be returning next week to enjoy other interesting sounding items like pork and ahi sliders."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday! It was amazing! They treated us very well and the food was outstanding! I gave it a 4 but there's no point honestly its a 5 out of 5! It was amazing! Worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"Went in for Happy our birthday dinner and it was delicious! For appetizers we had the calamari, and cream cheese rangoons. The calamari was a great size for the $5 happy hour price. We also ordered \"the surfer\". It was really good! We also had the damn good roll. So good!   Overall the service was outstanding and the food was delicious! They also had their music up loud which helped get our little girl dancing while she eats. Thanks for the great birthday dinner guys!"}
{"text":"Have been looking for some higher quality fish than what I'm used to getting in old town, so I decided to venture a bit north and check out sushi brokers, I had heard nothing but positive reviews.  I was not disappointed, the sushi was very creative, the fish was really fresh, I was pleased with the presentation, flavors and textures, it was nice having good sushi since there seems to be far less quality establishments these days.  I highly recommend checking it out for your self, the only slight draw back is price so be ready to pay for the quality."}
{"text":"Love this place but what's crazy is that I don't love it for sushi I love it for the Burger! Honestly i wouldn't of tried it but everyone got it so I did too. Best burger next to my dad's burger which is crazy! The place is nice I love the seating and the customer service! Want a burger? Come here."}
{"text":"First off let me start off by saying that the food is good and the service is good. The reason this is getting one star is because our $17 glasses of silver oak cab were served CHILLED like ice cold. When you're serving a good wine the worst thing you can do is ruin in it by serving it the wrong temperature. When we told the bartender this he said he was sorry and he agreed with us but there was nothing he can do because \"that's how ownership wants it\". You might as well be serving box wine. Next time we will go to Stingray who at least knows how to serve good wine."}
{"text":"I LALALALALOVE Sushi Brokers! They have the BEST happy hour prices! The Chimi Roll is amazingggg! I def recommend them, this is my hands down, fav sushi place!"}
{"text":"Sushi Brokers and I go a ways back.  Used to come here for reverse happy hour back in high school because it was the only \"cool\" bar we could go to after 10 on a weekend lol.  I have generally always gone for reverse happy hour, which in my opinion is the only thing Sushi Brokers has going for it.  Happy Hr prices are very reasonable, and they have all the standard types of sushi on the happy hour menu, as well as some creative rolls.  Happy hour aside though....it absolutely blows my mind how expensive their sushi is during normal pricing.  While the fish isn't bad per say....it is not high quality stuff.  It's edible, but nothing special to warranty the prices they charge.  Stick to the rolls here...most of them are covered in yummy sauces which help mask the lackluster fish.  Lots of their appetizers on the happy hr menu are pretty decent too...crab rangoons, calamari, and spring rolls are all regular items on my bill.  The service here can be hit or miss depending on whos working.  I know its really just a bar, so I feel bad complaining about service, but sometimes it really flat out sucks.  Pretty extensive bar selection, lots of good drinks, but I mainly just do beer/sake here.  Back in the day they used to have one of the largest selections of vodka's in the city....not sure if that still holds true.  I really want to give them 2 stars, but I can't.  The reverse happy hour really is a good deal, especially when I just want to go out and grab a few drinks and some food with friends and not deal with any Scottsdale BS like you would encounter at a place like Sapporo.  Take my advice folks ONLY come here during happy hour or reverse happy hour, its not worth it any other time."}
{"text":"Editing Review: This place has totally gone down hill since its hay day- i haven't even been there in over a year because the in 2012-2013 everytime i went and wanted it to be good like it used to be, it ended up being mediocre at best!   My favorite sushi spot, the food is great, i would recommend the SANCHEZ roll, the CHIMI CHONGA, and the SURFER...they are great! the atmosphere is also very good! i'm not the biggest fan of sushi but thsi place really gets me in the mood to do it up!"}
{"text":"My hubby talked me into going for lunch a couple of weeks ago. He LOVES sushi, I like it. Lunch specials were amazing and chicken bento box is excellent. We went back tonight, a busy Friday evening. Maddy was our server--very attentive, friendly and helpful. Spicy, garlic edamame was very slimy and we've had better nearby. My tuna/salmon poke bowl was terrific and filling. Hubby loved all the sushi except spicy tuna roll. He says their sauce is different and will not bother with it again. He really enjoyed other pieces and rolls.  Place is busy and fair.y noisy."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place. Staff was excellent. Food was good. My coke was always getting refilled. The Surfer Eoll was my favorite."}
{"text":"Eaten high-end sushi in San Fran, NYC, Vegas..the Sanchez roll at Sushi Brokers in Scottsdale is the best roll I have EVER had... Great atmosphere, great wait staff... Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sushi Brokers is one of my absolute FAVORITE places to eat. I eat here quite often, they have great food and a wonderful staff! They have food for every one which is nice, especially for those who aren't sushi lovers. They have a great menu with a variety of \"typical\" Asian dishes, some deliciously unique cooked fish options and even a wonderful hamburger with some exceptionally yummy mix of regular and sweet potato fires. The sushi speaks for it self, they have so many great options I am never bored with what I'm eating. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for sushi and happy hour! Never had a roll here that i didn't like. The spicy mayo they put on a lot of the rolls is so addicting i always have to get some on the side! Plus the staff are all so nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"First off, I love the service here. We came in with a part of 13 on a Saturday for my birthday. This location is tiny compared to the Scottsdale location and unfortunately they don't take reservations. They were packed so we got drinks and snacks at the bar and hung out. The servers were super sweet and kept working around us as obviously this is a very popular place.   After about 45 minutes and 2 16 year olds pushing tables together as fast as they could, we were sat and our server was PHENOMENAL. She got drinks out, sushi ordered, she had drinks refilled, faster than I could drink. She was listening across the table while my friends laughed, yelled, told stories. We all tried our hardest to make sure no one was oblivious, but she was on top of it. The manager was super nice and brought out a free roll as we waited a bit for some food (some friends don't eat sushi and ordered chicken - which may have been the only chicken orders of the night).   At the end of the night was when I was the most floored. Most of the time, if you go out with a big party, the policy is \"here's the huge check, you deal with it.\" Some parties had to split off early and she covered them no problem. Then she just went down the table, split everyone up, everyone fought over covering each other (apparently all my future wedding party who had just met realllly liked each other) and she was just kind as can be.   I was beyond thankful at her amazing attitude, making my birthday so wonderful, and her willingness to bend. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service from Maddy!  I had the Wok Bowl with chicken, delicious!"}
{"text":"I know what you are thinking: sushi in the desert?  Yeah me too.  We have had our bad experiences in Arizona, but not here.  Of course or best ever sushi experience was in Half Moon Bay, California.    Sushi Brokers was great.  We walked in on a slammed Friday night and took two seats at the bar right away.  The selection was great.  The service was FAST.  We stuffed ourselves on sushi. It's like ice cream to us. The bill was quite reasonable.  Will definitely come back.  I liked the atmosphere.  It was cooler when we went.  The only thing out of their control is that the parking garage for all those restaurants is right across the walk way.  Maybe they could get screens to hide the view?  Sitting at the bar has the garage to your back, but I certainly wouldn't want to be looking at it."}
{"text":"I'm no expert but I enjoy sushi and have had plenty on trips to Japan.   For what it is, I thought this was fine. Service was fast, probably too fast. A starter should be at least partially consumed before you start bringing mains but if pacing is the worst thing you can say about someplace if say they're down well.   We snuck in right before happy hour ended so we benefitted from some discounted food. The chimichanga sushi was excellent and all others we ordered were at least good."}
{"text":"My wife and I live walking distance to downtown Gilbert so we spend a lot of money on food down here. When we heard there was a sushi place coming to town, we couldn't be more excited. However, after our visit we were left feeling really disappointed.  When we arrived, we sat at the sushi bar. The first thing we noticed was how disorganized everything was. The people making the sushi were placing the finished plates randomly on a metal table behind them. The servers would then walk up and pick up random sushi and take them to the respective tables. I would watch as the old rolls would sit there without being taken while the new rolls would go out first. There was clearly not enough room back behind the sushi bar as you had people constantly running into each other and looking confused in general.   After about 10 minutes and when we placed our order, another couple sat next to us. Our order seemed to be taking a really long time and to our surprise, the couple next to us had 3 rolls delivered to them before we had anything delivered to us. Due to the fact that the service was also pretty bad and nobody checked on us, I had to track down a waitress to see what was taking so long and to find out why we hadn't had our food even though we clearly had our order in before the couple next to us.   Like I said above, I had been really watching the sushi go out as I was really hungry at that time. I noticed that one of our rolls was made but it was just sitting there for what seemed like 10 minutes. During this time, I saw as employees would walk by it and lightly brush it with their shirt or arm because of how cramped it was. When I told the waitress it was taking a while, she reached for that roll and tried to give it to us. I was so disgusted that I had to tell them to remake it (which was the first time I ever had to do anything like that). The waitress and the people making the sushi clearly got pretty angry about this, and I felt bad, but I was not going to eat that roll after what I saw.   Most of the above probably would not have happened had our server actually checked on us. The entire time we were probably checked on twice.   When we finally got our rolls, we were really disappointed. We ordered 2 Cali rolls and 1 Las Vegas roll. The Cali rolls were falling apart before we even touched them. They were also pretty bad and really chewy. The Las Vegas roll was pretty good though so that was a plus.   After that, we got out of there and went somewhere else because we were still pretty hungry. I am writing this review because I genuinely hope this place changes for the better. We are not going to come back for quite a while though. $40 will buy me a much better meal at the places around the area."}
{"text":"The server was nice, but everything else sucked, the drinks sucked, the food sucked, and 50 bucks for a damn salad and one roll of sushi, that wasn't even that good?? I didn't even finish the salad, because surprise, it sucked lol."}
{"text":"Good sushi an nice atmosphere with music.. Drinks are nice an strong an plenty of seating away from entrance."}
{"text":"Decent happy hour drinks but food items are not quite up to par. Too bad because it's a sexy place, just not a complete package."}
{"text":"The sushi was OK here - the rolls and especially the very non-traditional ones seemed to be the best.  I think the quality of the fish isn't super fresh, but the rolls make up for that with the extra ingredients.  I had like the cowgirl or something that was pretty good and spicy - perhaps that masked the fish more?  Either way, the drinks were good, although we were drinking a bit much - then again it was Cinco de Mayo."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place!!! I love coming here for happy hour. I actually don't like seafood and always order the volcano chicken, it's AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Everything about Sushi Brokers is fine. Nothing stands out as spectacular -- service, food, and prices are all average. There are certainly other places close by I prefer. In a pinch, it's ok.   Blasé."}
{"text":"LOVE sushi brokers, but I only go there during happy hour. The happy hour prices are reasonable, but as soon as you go during regular hours, the prices skyrocket. If you are looking for sushi that is worth the money - go during happy hour, which is every day from 3-6:30pm. The rolls are phenomenal, the calamari, and crab rangoons are all delicious. My favorite roll so far is the Las Vegas! The drinks are pretty great too."}
{"text":"We waited half an hour for food before the server realized she forgot to put the order in.  The food was good, but the service was disappointing."}
{"text":"We don't have a lot of sushi options in Arcadia, so I was happy to see this restaurant arrived in our neighborhood.  I went the first week they opened and *hated* it.  Really, it was not a good experience, the place was not busy at all, but they were already out of Kirin Light, and they had no happy hour menu in place.    Went back last Friday night and fell in love with the place.  It was busy, there was an awesome happy hour menu to order from, and the specialty cocktails were great.  $2 off during happy hour!  Love their version of the Las Vegas roll, and will definitely go back for more happy hours in the future.... perfect price point.    Some people don't like the decor, but if you've lived in Arcadia for awhile, you know this building was a Pizza Hut years ago.  I think they've done a great job of turning the interior into a hip sushi joint.  Go and try it!"}
{"text":"This was the 2nd time I was at Sushi Brokers 1/18/17. Service was ok. The server hit every table in our section except our table. She was not very friendly. Sushi was average. I would go back due to it being less than a mile from my house."}
{"text":"I'm not usually in the Gilbert area but was down here for an event and then met up with some friends for dinner. Going into the restaurant, it was really nice. The decor was very modern and felt open. They have a pretty large bar and plenty of seating. There is a large outdoor patio with even more seating. I was impressed on how big the place was. When you get seated they present two menus to you; one sushi and the other for everything else (the drink menu is already on the table). They have a lot of sushi and appetizers to choose from. I liked the California Club Roll, it was my first time trying it and it was a cool combination of meats with a tasty sauce to boot.  For parking, you will need to choose the farther lots and walk to the restaurant. You wont be able to park right in front. It is a very quick walk though.  Even though it was a really busy Friday night the staff did great. They still checked on us and made sure our drinks were topped off. Everyone was happy and were smiling quite a bit. This was exciting to see.   I would recommend to try this place out. It is a nice sushi place you can go to and enjoy the experience if you are in the Gilbert area."}
{"text":"Our family came here for happy hour on a weeknight. They do have a nice sized happy hour menu, with average prices. I'd like to try it again, in the hopes that things would move a little bit quicker next time. We ordered a ton of Nigiri, and a couple of rolls for our kids. It took at least 20 minutes to get anything out. Service was nice and friendly. Atmosphere was cool, this place is big and I imagine on a weekend night it gets pretty lively and fun in there! It would be a great place to go with a group of friends. Oh - and for us Gluten Free-ers, they do have tamari which is nice."}
{"text":"went here recently for my first reverse happy hour visit. It was pretty busy at 11p on a friday night and i think this was the first time I realized how close the tables are to each other by the wall on the right of the entrance, talk about being friendly to your neighbors, although there was this cute guy who smiled at me but my damn shy self ignored him and looked at my phone to check in. muy trieste! Anywho, ordered myself the witch doctor martini that i so adore, and learned that my hh specialty drink was at $6, future reference get 2 coz they're YUM. Dani and I shared the calamari, the veggie tempura and the Diamondback, all were good, and we enjoyed our late night sushi fix, with good music, good vibes, and yes she serenaded with her ill version, my ears are still bleeding =P"}
{"text":"In an effort to get away from both the menu and the crowd at RA, I've been sampling various sushi restaurants across the valley with a friend over the last few weeks.  Sushi Brokers was a promising find on Yelp, even if it met the bare minimum of our requirements (3 stars on Yelp, no egregiously bad reviews).  The result was far below expectation.  Upon walking in, Sushi Brokers looks and sounds like an odd hybrid between RA and a standard sports bar.  The hostesses were the highlight of the evening, promptly greeting and seating us at an outdoor table.  Even outside we were barely able to hear one another over the thumping music.  I suppose that's appealing for some, but it detracted greatly from our ability to communicate with one another over dinner.  The vegetarian options at this restaurant were fairly standard for Asian fare.  The only veggie-friendly roll on their extensive sushi menu was a standard veggie roll, a huge disappointment to me.  I've come to expect at least two veggie-friendly rolls on the menu; to find only one was disheartening.  It was happy hour, so all the rolls our group ordered were $4 apiece.  Honestly, even $4 was more than they were worth.  The rolls were small, sloppily assembled, and mediocre in taste.  Furthermore, the veggie rolls were placed on the same plate as rolls containing fish, including one roll containing shellfish.  This is never something I have encountered at any sushi restaurant; while some sushi chefs will combine rolls onto the same plate, they are usually smart enough to separate rolls that indicate obvious dietary restrictions (vegetarian, for example).  Service left a lot to be desired.  While our water glasses were always full, it was next to impossible to track down our server.  When our dessert was brought to our table, mine was incorrect--I had ordered the tempura ice cream, and I was brought plain instead.  The woman who brought it darted away from the table before we could draw her attention to the mistake, and it took close to ten minutes to flag down someone who could.  If you're looking for a Scottsdale feel close to Scottsdale Quarter that isn't RA, I suppose this would fit the bill.  However, it is one sushi bar I will never again feel the need to patronize."}
{"text":"We visited Friday night at 7pm and were sat immediately at the sushi bar. This has been a long time favorite but I must say that the quality of the food has gone down significantly. We won't return."}
{"text":"They will NOT give you all thier menus,They try to hock tbe sushi only. This is just idiotic and a total rip off as well.(rolls are fairly expensive and by far the largest profit margin)  We had to ask Lunch special menu when we saw people getting hamburgers and finally found out they had a FULL menu. Total BS.  The manager was a drone and just stood there with a glazed look on his face. Did not even offer an explanation. We are local and not tourists to be ripped off...   Never never again."}
{"text":"I was excited that there's a new sushi joint in the neighborhood, and took advantage of the Deal Chicken that was being offered. We decided to sit at the sushi bar for dinner. Service was a little weird, they had one guy that seated us from behind the bar, who then took our order for sushi, but we also wanted hot food, so we had to call him over again. He seemed a little slammed as he was doing this for everyone else too, usually servers come behind the bar to take your drink/hot food order. I've eaten at sushi bars many times, but the process here seemed a little confusing.   We order the calamari, it was cooked pretty well and came with a spicy buffalo type sauce - not bad. We also ordered salmon skin, yellow tail nigiri, and the pineapple roll. The nigiri didn't seem as fresh as I would've liked it, however the pineapple roll was pretty awesome, a great mix of flavor with fresh fruit. Price was $48 before the Deal Chicken.   I know I can go to Hana and get the same thing for $30 and it tastes much fresher, and the service is better. So I would probably only return with a Deal Chicken."}
{"text":"I'm a long time Sushi Brokers fan. I don't care that it's \"so Scottsdale\" (also a horrible name of a local magazine). You know how I avoid the crowd? I get my sushi to-go and eat it at home while I watch Girls OnDemand. I am not a total loser, contrary to the way that sounds. Although, my mother is disgusted by the thought of eating sushi to-go. Hey, it's my version of a home cooked meal ... a nice meal, you eat at home. Don't judge me.   If you like creative rolls, this place is for you. I have eaten everything from duck feet to crickets, so my palate can handle a piece of raw fish. I just happen to also like rolls covered in mango and sweet sake. Really takes it to a whole new level, if you ask me. If you want to be a sushi purest, then please go eat sushi in Japan. I have, and wouldn't you know, they also have creative rolls. They have everything. The world is a very small place these days."}
{"text":"Two words..... Surfer roll.   Freaking awesome.  It takes a little longer to make but is by far the best roll if you like shrimp!"}
{"text":"Friends and I go once a month for happy hour (Arcadia) which always moves to regular time because it's so good.  The problem...The waitress' cannot get the bill right.  Every time we go, there seems to be a problem.  Credit cards mixed up, charged wrong, and the latest is our credit card was charged twice.  I'm beginning to think there's something fishy in Denmark.  Try and get a manager on the phone - close to impossible.  My advise is take cash because we've had a plethora of waitress' and all of them are great except when it comes time to pay."}
{"text":"Sushi was fair and ginger was soggy. Service was fair and waited for ever for our one role."}
{"text":"Short version: AWESOME FOOD (get the damn good roll and the surfer roll) but PRETTY POOR SERVICE (servers not attentive, mess up orders, super slow).    Long version: I struggle with this restaurant because the food is a 4.5 - 5 but the service is usually a 2.   The Damn Good Roll is mandatory for us as well as the Surfer Roll. Salmon sashimi and the Sunshine Roll are also great. The food is consistently good here.   That said, don't come expecting good service. The servers typically (4 out of 5 times) don't check in on you, they mess up orders and don't apologize for the long waits or mistakes. It's unfortunate because this would be an awesome place and a solid 5 stars if t wasn't for the bad service.   I go to the one in Arcadia about once a week, sometimes twice a week with my whole team and the service is a little better, and perhaps partially because it's not busy at lunch. We go to the Scottsdale location for dinner, probably once every couple weeks, and it is bad more often than not unfortunately.  Their food is their saving grace here which is better than the other way around I guess.   A little off topic, but if anyone at Sushi Brokers is reading this, find out how the severs at Hillstone are trained because their service is impeccable."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place is underwhelming. The only thing we liked was the atmosphere. The food was not good. We ordered vegetable cups which were ok, but the grilled Mahi Mahi was terrible. It was over cooked and clearly sat under a heating lamp for a while before it made it to our table. It was one of the worst Mahi Mahi dishes I've ever tasted. The rolls were small, generic, you get larger and better rolls at other places around town. I ordered a cocktail and it was mostly chunks of ice, not much of the actual cocktail.  Won't be back, not worth it."}
{"text":"I seriously don't get all the haters.   Already this year, I've had sushi in Hong Kong, Paris, London, New York, and Tokyo ... and sushi Brokers still makes some of my favorite rolls. A week ago I was dreaming about their Hawaiian Roll after spending 14 days in New Delhi suffering from traveler's diarrhea. I was like, I can't wait to get home and eat food that doesn't make me shit my pants. (I didn't actually shit in my pants, but it makes for a better story). All these people complaining sound so annoying. Like your palate's really all that refined. Stop pretending you're Anthony Bourdain eating at Sukiyabashi Jiro. You don't know shit about sushi and you probably don't even know who Jiro is.   P.S. Anyone who hopes a restaurant goes up in flames has zero grasp on reality and needs a hobby. Might I suggest taking up sushi making at home?"}
{"text":"EVERY TIME I try this place the service is terrible. The are never staffed properly... extremely frustrating and always a reason to not chose this spot to eat at"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite sushi place in town. I don't know why, but it is. Their sushi rolls are amazing, the fish is fresh -- and it doesn't have that \"fishy\" smell like other sushi restaurants. Sometimes the service isn't that great, but hey, it's always busy and the sushi makes up for it. Just make sure you have a little bit of time when going here. And here's a tip: Get the lollipop roll with the shrimp topping off the surfer roll on it -- pure blissful heavenly goodness!!!"}
{"text":"Took the family to this place for the first time! The staff was so friendly and the food was really good! I highly recommend you get here early and enjoy. Just as we were leaving around 5:30 it was starting to get packed!"}
{"text":"Food was ok ... I didnt think any part of it was special. We didn't take long to get seated. I asked for a menu as we had a kid with us that didn't want rolls or something from the happy hour menu. We never got one, despite the fact that the waitress tried to take our order twice and both times we asked for a menu. I finally grabbed one from the hostess. Then when the waitress saw I grabbed one, she made a shitty comment about how she needed a minute. Your other tables aren't my concern. I've asked twice. 3rd time, I'll get it.  The friends we were with raved about Sushi Brokers. It was alright. Calamari was chewy, rolls were good, teriyaki chicken was ok, miso was ok, service yuck. It didn't grab me. Maybe another time ..."}
{"text":"I'm an Arcadia resident who has been eating at Sushi Brokers since they opened. We were big fans! Recently someone told me they do not allow children any longer, so I called to check. Lo and behold, the girl who answered the phone,who was very sweet, told us that the owner is an alcoholic who hates children... I was shocked that she would openly share this, and told her so. She laughed and said that he has instructed his employees to openly let clients know that he hates children and they are not welcome in his establishment. Apparently he's fine with his employees sharing that he is an alcoholic as well. Suffice it to say that we will never again step foot in this restaurant. Karma is a bitch!"}
{"text":"I've said all I can say!! It's the business!!! ; ) beautiful blond at the bar was as pleasant as efficient!!"}
{"text":"At best, this is a mediocre place for sushi.  The food was okay, nothing earth shattering, the service was okay, the server came when you flagged her down. The value vs. price of the items are below average.  If you are from SF, L.A., or NY, and are used to their standard of sushi or sashimi in terms of selection or freshness, this is not the place which is contrary to the name,"}
{"text":"Went there last night with my spouse and our 5 year old daughter. The first time we came here the food was amazing but the service was terrible. We went there again for the food (obviously) and this time a server named Jessica took care of us. She was PHENOMENAL! The entire restaurant filled up as we sat and enjoyed our food, Jessica didn't even bat am eye. She was just as amazing with the last customer that could fit in the place as she was with us! We will now return, over and over, but not just for the food but the service too! Thanks Jessica!"}
{"text":"Sushi is always excellent at the broker!  High quality fish but go at happy hour because this place is pricey!  We always get the damn good and then either cowboy or cowgirl for a sweet/spicy combo!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this out for lunch since it is near my work. Ordered a philly roll and their specialty surf n turf. The philly roll was ok and the surf n turf was interesting at most.   I think the biggest letdown on this place is their pricing. Their lunch special options is not that great (or many, only 3 options I believe) and they do not have any lunch special pricing for their sushi."}
{"text":"I dont get it.  This place has average sushi at extraordinary pricing.  I guess if you go for the \"ambiance\" or something like that, then its a fine place.  The sushi is fine and tasty, but I much prefer Benihana sushi - especially for happy hour which is about 1/3 the price of this place's happy hour.  I will admit its a cool place to be, a place to be seen, its packed with good looking people, etc...but if you are going for the food - look elsewhere to get your sushi fix."}
{"text":"This is a great places to have happy hour with friends.  I enjoy everything here from the atmosphere to the drink specials and sushi.  They offer a variety of fun martinis and have good happy hour prices on sushi and nigiri.  It is also fun to enjoy your meal while sitting at the sushi bar and watching the chefs make your food fresh right in front of you."}
{"text":"Hey they haven't tried to kill me yet! That's a pretty good compliment for a sushi place (I'm deathly allergic to shellfish). They have a nice vegetarian sushi selection and do an awesome job of avoiding cross-contamination. I also appreciate that the waiters have always been nice when I tell them I'm allergic to shellfish, instead of acting like it's a huge inconvenience. I know that sounds weird, but it's kind of a big deal for someone in my position."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!! This place is beyond stuck up!!! I've been here three times and tonight was my LAST!   First trip, I sat at the sushi bar and my bartender got my order wrong three times! But the worst part was he kept blaming the sushi guys. He obviously didn't realize I could hear him talking over his mistakes. Hello! I'm sitting at the sushi bar right in front!! I didn't tip him and gave all my money to the sushi chefs. Own up to your mistakes! Don't blame others for your short comings! I can't stand people like that. Sorry dude but you are not better than the Mexican cooks when all you do is make drinks and mess up easy orders. I bartended in my day. Not that difficult.   Second visit our waitress was on top of her game but VERY snobby!   Today... I walk in with my daughter and boyfriend exhausted after a family funeral this week and my back is injured so I asked for a booth. She replied we only have high tops or the bar seating. I look over and say \"what about that booth?\" It was larger and as dead as it was in the place and minutes before happy hour ended she replied: oh, we save those for larger groups in case they come in\" in the snobbiest voice possible. After working in this industry I was annoyed. First of all, you don't tell your customer that. You say \"let me check\" or \"that area is not open\" or \"I don't have a server for that table\". Not, oh you don't have enough people with you to occupy that booth. Customer service! Where is it these days?! I was tired! I wanted to relax and enjoy my overpriced sushi! I have spent enough in that place to deserve a booth if I request one. Trust me it was needed! Long story short, I walked out and gave my business to someone else. I WILL NOT BE BACK! (Which is sad because I LOVE sushi and I live down the street.) If you are good with this type of service and frequent Scottsdale regularly, this place might work for you. But if you are like me who doesn't mind spending and splurging on good service but can do with out snobby stuck up people, you may have a similar experience so beware!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time the other day for happy hour. The sushi was good! We tried the tootsie, diamondback, las vegas, shrimp tempura, and crunchy rolls. All were very good though still expensive for being happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Food was just ok.  What stands out about this place is how overpriced it is. We went in during happy hour ordered couple of special roles and couple of regular roles and a beer for $60.00.  And this is happy hour!  The food was not that good. Service was nice. But won't be going back."}
{"text":"Bad food. I gave 2 stars because of the great service that received from the bartender. I forgot his name, but he was really personable and attentive, and made a great Manhattan. I ordered the Alaskan which is a salmon roll, Albacore sashimi, and crab rangoon. The Alaskan tasted like sawdust, and was very dry. I could not eat it. The albacore was not much better as it was tough, ate one bite of that although it was edible. The crab rangoon was just ok. You could tell that it was either made ahead of time, or sat to long after it was made. I did eat most of it. I was not charged for everything as I brought it to the attention of the bartender, as mentioned he was very good. Funny, after I got done eating, I looked it up on Yelp and I knew that it would be rated 3 and 1/2 stars as it was mediocre at best. One other thing to complain about was that they had soccer on every tv while there was a Suns game being played. I know that some people like soccer, but does it have to be on every tv? I looked around, and I could not see one person watching it. Bottom line is that I will not be back unless there are major changes."}
{"text":"Came during the soft opening and everything looked beautiful. The executive chef was in town to oversee the preparations and the service was fantastic. Why 2 stars? I ordinarily would be very hesitant to blame a restaurant on yelp for food poisoning since that's a serious thing; however, when the chef admits to us that the contractor has to come back to fix the preparation station because they didn't build an ice station to keep the food at the proper temperature and I'm sick as a dog less than 12 hours later ... I'll let you make the determination. Unbelievably, I'll probably give them a second chance but not for several months."}
{"text":"I was meeting my friend that I have known since 5th grade (we are 55 years). It was my suggestion we go to Sushi Brokers, she is new to the valley. I arrived and sat down, no one greeted me for 10 minutes! I gave them the benefit of the doubt that they figured I was meeting somene. Soo, my friend arrives and another 20 minutes goes by and no server. We were not provided a menu, which I have seen before, just the sushi menu and the Bento menu. I know there must be more menus. Maybe not. Anyway, the service was horrible, we sat for an hour with no water, she said she had been there for 7 years...........she should have better skills. The food was just so-so. Teriyaki chicken was swimming in \"sauce\". Not good. Will not go back. So disappointing, used to be good.  Oh, one more thing. I ordered a glass of white wine and the glass was dirty with red wine goo, they gave me a clean glass but poured the original dirty wine back in the glass, REALLY!!!!"}
{"text":"So many wrong things with this place that I don't know where to start.   First of all, I called ahead of time trying to make a reservation since we were taking several clients on a dinner. The lady at the phone told me that they don't take reservations and that it is first come first serve. If you are going to charge like place that takes reservations THEN take reservations.  Service was alright however our server saw that our party was somewhat big and she mentioned more than a handful of times that \"We only take 4 different methods of payment, is that ok??\". Even though we paid using only one method of payment that is just unnecessary. Our server messed up our order but I'm taking into consideration that the place was pretty busy. As someone already mentioned the music is a little bit too loud and if you want to have a conversation expect to be yelling across the table.  The food was a complete hit or miss. The rolls were either really really good or bland and falling apart.  Taking everything into consideration and listening to the comments the manager made to a couple right next to our table I WILL NOT be returning to this place."}
{"text":"When I can get delicious sushi until 1:30 am, sign me up!!  The restaurant is decorated in the usual Japanese flair. It can be romantic as it is dimly lit and cozy.  We sat at the bar, we were greeted warmly, immediately and personally as the gentleman I was with is a local chef and is like hanging out with a rock star :) Our first of 5 courses was a sushimi with avocado and an amazing sweet sauce. Our final course was the collar of salmon grilled to such perfection we ate some of the skin....THE WOW FACTOR IS FOR REAL HERE!! Paired with saki bombers we left with big smiles and full bellies ;) Thank you Sushi brokers.  You can trust me, I'm in the business ;D"}
{"text":"Love this place it's open pretty late and I've always had a great experience! Food comes super quickly and it's always super delicious! Late night happy hour is a steal! (:"}
{"text":"This place is the spot to be on a Friday and Saturday! Really fun environment. The drinks are awesome, and their happy hour is great. Fun place to hang with friends. The sushi is pretty good, the service is great, and everyone is really helpful."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times I love their fried rice with shrimp, their sushi isn't that great due to the Prices , I can't complain much about it cause fish isn't always fresh in AZ"}
{"text":"Typically at a sushi restaurant I order 2 rolls and maybe some miso soup which is enough to satisfy my appetite. At Sushi Brokers, I went with the same philosophy but added 3 nigiri pieces instead of the soup. That proved to be more than I bargained for. I ordered the Surfer roll and the Asparagus roll to go along with the Salmon, Tuna and Snapper nigiri. The Surfer roll was almost a meal in itself. Imagine 8 pieces covered with large pieces of \"Dynamite shrimp and Krab\" mounded on top. It was more of a sushi gumbo piled on the roll. Very unexpected and very delicious. A must try. The ingredients were obviously very fresh and tasty. Happy Hour until 7 on a Thursday at the sushi bar made it super affordable. I was served by several very attentive bartenders at the sushi bar who always made sure my cup was filled and the food was perfect. For those GF folk, they were able to provide Tamari GF soy sauce upon request. Not as common I have found elsewhere as I would expect. If I lived here l, I would be a regular. As it is, the next time I'm back for business in Scottsdale, I will be back to Sushi Brokers."}
{"text":"Sushi brokers never fails to disappoint.... it's a good place to go well have sushi. Cool ambiance and service. We drive from Glendale and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"I cant believe it took this long to right this review! We went to sushi broker. We went on 2/2/18 and our server was Mckenzie! She was SO RAD. You dont really run into really kind genuine servers often these days but she was so rad.  We will definitely will return because of her, she was so attentive and was on it even though it was super busy . WOOHOO!"}
{"text":"I've had good times and not so good times here, but the good definitely outweighs the bad by far. Last friday I went for happy hour with  a total of 7 friends (one of whom went insanely early in order to save us a table). Arriving at 5:30, I couldn't believe how packed it was! No recession here! I love the music they play- it's just feel-good, trendy pop, but it puts me in to mood to eat, drink and be merry!   I always get the Cowboy roll- which is spicy tuna with cucumbers, spicy sauce and scallions and it just does it for me. For the first time I tried a friend's chimichanga roll and must say that I am now a huge fan! It was even spicier than the cowboy and like a mini party in my mouth! My other fav thing here is the calamari! Its lightly breaded and comes with the best tangy sauce that I always want to keep for later even though I don't know what I would use it for. I'm just a sauce hoarder. And at happy hour an order is only 4 bucks! Beat that? I dont think so. And the specialty rolls are only 8 bucks!  Sushi brokers always treats me well and I leave full, buzzed and happy. Just get there early to get a seat for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Man the service here is a mess! Sat there for like 10 plus minutes when it was not busy mind you while all the staff chatted among each other including the manager while ignoring their customers. Watched an other couple walk up to the host stand about the time I was sat only to watch them stand there and wait to even be greeted let alone sat or get an order placed. When I was finally able to get service I got a drink order in but had to wait a good bit of time once again to have any shot of placing an actual order. Finally get the food and a roll we ordered was missing which we had to desperately wave down help to make them aware of only to be lied to about how that roll takes longer and they will go check on, Which we then watch the waitress head over to the chef and have him make it real quick all within plain view of where we were sitting. She comes back and continued with the charade of that roll taking longer.   On a side note the lighting was very odd in there and bit brighter than you would expect for an nice evening dinner. It was like a bar at closing time and all the lights came on.  Food was not bad but not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin! The food and service was phenomenal!  The surfer roll is probably my favorite roll ever! The sunshine roll was also really good as was the spicy edamame. Honestly, there was nothing but love for every item. My stomach is happy and very full!!! PS: Ask about the #secretmenu dessert!!! Yummmmm"}
{"text":"This sushi bar is just so so. There isn't really anything that stands out about them other than their pricing. Their drinks and sushi rolls are definitely over priced compared to the other local sushi places in the area."}
{"text":"Solid standby for good sushi and happy hour.  I've been through just about the entire menu and every roll available so it's obviously good enough to keep going back to.  A couple times I have had tuna sashimi that had sinew in it which was disappointing, but they gladly replaced it or exchanged it for something else.  Great wine and drink selection, great service, great atmosphere.    Recommendations: lollipop roll, shrimp dynamite roll, Tokyo bowl, cowgirl roll, vegetable tempura."}
{"text":"Recently went to Sushi Brokers for happy hour, and 4 of us ate platters of Sushi, it was so nice. We especially loved the Chimichanga Sushi Roll which is a little sweet and spicy. We had great service and an overall great visit, nobody got sick, which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"We live across the street from this location.   We have been customers of this sushi place for over a year now, ordering once sometimes twice a week.   We have serious food allergies and are vegetarians and they've always been accommodating. UNTIL NOW.   New year, new Sushi Brokers. Terrible customer service.   We've always ordered a 5-6 cucumber rolls and 4 avocado rolls- Gluten Free. We called in tonight to place our usual order and the girl rudely said \"we aren't allowed to take orders over the phone anymore, you'll have to order online\". Fine, whatever.   So I go to order online and there's no option for us to order what we normally get. I can't even edit things to order what I want! No modifications what so ever.   I call back to explain the issue and they STILL won't take my order over the phone. So now, we are stuck with RA Sushi down on Scottsdale Road- who has cucumber rolls AND avocado rolls on their menu. Assholes!"}
{"text":"The service was prompt and friendly without being at all pretentious.  That was nice.  Also the music isn't blaring in your ears which was also a nice change.  We got the cowgirl (yellowfish awesomeness), shrimp tempura (pretty dang delicious), and the Alaskan (tastes like a dry tunafish filling in a roll...).  The calamari was also good - not too greasy, I liked the cabbage on the side to help cleanse the palate.  So with the exception of the Alaskan roll we thought the food was pretty straight.  All in all, the rolls are delicious, but the prices even at happy hour are kinda higher than I would pay regularly.  So maybe a reserve for a special occasion kinda place?"}
{"text":"This place is my go-to sushi restaurant! It's not anywhere near where I live but I don't mind the distance at all! If you are a tea person, try their green tea with an orange slice. They are sort of pricey but you're paying for what you get. The staff is all really nice, they don't write anything down and also never forget anything either. It's always busy and loud at Sushi Brokers so I wouldn't recommend bringing your newborn baby. If you're planning on going on a weekend or a Friday night, make reservations, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Yummy sushi!  We get the salmon sushi which is fresh tasting and delicious. The sunshine roll and the Las Vegas roll are creatively yummy. And the shrimp tempura roll is a must!!  Excellent place for sushi!"}
{"text":"Did reverse happy hour and ordered three rolls, edamame, and miso soup. Then the booty booty specialty roll. All of the food was fantastic. The service is a little slow getting the food out and what not but it was a busy Friday night. The taste of the food definitely made up for lack of service though."}
{"text":"Overrated and not that fresh tasting. The service was sub-par. Way better options in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Interior contemporary remodel with nostalgic Pizza Hit windows. This is what the neighborhood waited, waited, and waited for. Hmm.  Bring your charge card folks. Your favorite sushi bar may not easily not be toppled as pricey rolls, sashimi and drinks await you. Market price is 22% above your new payroll tax, pun intended.  Fish was fresh and lollipop roll was fun. Friendly service. Water carafe on the table for the self-refills available. Unusual wet rock glass for the saki is served.   Bathrooms need work. Employees may wish to leave towels outside when walking thru."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch today and the Surfer Roll it was beyond amazing!!!!! I had such awesome service provided by Ms. Kylie!!!! She is super funny and wonderful!!!! I am definitely coming back this Friday night with all my friends !!! Thank you !!!!!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is always a good time. I just wanted to give a shout out to our lovely waitress Mckenna- she was a sweetheart and made our dining experience that much better!"}
{"text":"Let's start on a positive note, the only reason I even give this 2 stars is for the sushi chefs. They work hard. But that's it.   The manger and I assume he is the manger because he was the only one in the colored pin strip shirt was nice at first. He welcomed us as we safe at the bar. And got us waters and our drinks. But that's it's. From the point on we had to ask for a menu to place our order get chopstick etc.  That wasn't even the annoying part. What was super annoying was at one point I counted 14 employees standing behind the bar. The sushi guys are working hard. Mean while the servers are doing nothing. Not all, there where two male server and one female. They actually worked.   It was a cluster and over whelming to look at. The servers wear workout pants. Didn't look flattering with crop top shirt and tight pants meant for the gym not work. And then the other half have on jeans.   This one girl. Super blonde skinny girl in a crop top had no place behind the bar. Not to mention the food is coming out and the sushi guys are working. all the girls are walking back there with there hair down. But this blonde girl was lost. She didn't do anything but run a hand full of plates the entire time we were there. She would just look in the mirror and play with her hair. Run her hand through, twirl it etc.. it was horrible, food is plated and she just stood there looking at her self the entire time we were there. Not to mention she was following the manager around and when they would talk it was all flirting and super awkward hair twirling while a plate of someone's food is sitting right there. Our entire dinner was just annoying because we sat at the bar.    There is no bar tender. The mom and daughter next to us had no napkins and had to ask for everything as well.   We each got one drink and a couple rolls, are tab was $85. After tip $100 and who knows where the tip goes. If they are splitting between everyone I would be pissed if I worked there. Half the employees just hang out they don't deserve anything when the other half. And when I say half I mean the sushi workers and the two male servers not the manager and the one girl with the north face jacket on deserve the tips.   Over all not worth the price to watch a cluster of people hang out. The sushi was ok not amazing. Will I be back probably not. Not interested."}
{"text":"A place can have great decor, food, and location but if you can't get any service then what is the point in going?  This place lost my business because of the terrible service.  I left before I was able to try any dishes because the service was so poor.  I was very excited to try the happy hour that lasted until 6:30 but I sat at the bar for 10 minutes with no service.  I finally decided to leave and they could have cared less. There were at least 5 waitresses behind the bar but no one acknowledged me.  It was extremely poor customer service and I would never return.  So disappointing.  I hope the owners would be ashamed of their staff."}
{"text":"All sushi is prepared right in front of you if you sit at the bar. The food is always fresh, and drinks are always cold. The California roll is made with actual crab and not \"crab salad\". Prompt service and a nice daily happy hour."}
{"text":"Hostess was super sweet, our server was awesome, but the sushi was under par. High price for poor quality. Seems to have a good happy hour."}
{"text":"Over priced and small portions for the $$$. Don't waste your time or money . Service is average , .. More of a bar, no draft beers I find odd, Tons of better sushi restaurants in Scottsdale  and Phoenix !!! Just believe in YELP they rated this 3.5 , I should of listened to my friends:).."}
{"text":"Have been going to this place for over five years and always so good.  Not the cheapest but good drinks and really good sushi.  Nice atmosphere and fun place to go."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and they have not disappointed.  Yes, their prices are a bit high and the restaurant is a bit loud sometimes due to the ambiance but that stuff can be overlooked.  I do wish they had a patio and a \"waiting\" area for when they go on a wait.  People tend to stand around other diners tables and makes it a bit uncomfortable.   Happy hour is good with about a dollar or $1.50 off some rolls and a few bucks off cocktails.  Dynamite roll is good as is the lollipop roll.  Simple rolls are also good as we are partial to the spicy tuna or yellow tail.    Be prepared to spend about $20/person here regardless of time of day as they are fairly expensive but we have yet to be disappointed by quality.  Service last weekend was absolutely excellent and made our experience that much more enjoyable.    A definite must go if you are in the north Scottsdale area (a few blocks north from Quarter) but be careful, they get fairly busy on Fri and Sat nights."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  It was almost empty on Saturday at opening time.  The ambiance is nice and comfortable.  The service was friendly and on point.  The menu options are diverse and well priced.  Really enjoyed the garlic edamame, tempura and sushi rolls.  The only thing that would have made it any better was if they offered inari sushi for my kids."}
{"text":"Volcano chicken!! One of the best things on the menu! Gotta love sake bombs too. But seriously, love this place, service is good, food is good, vibe is good. The only weird thing is how the \"bar\" and \"sushi bar\" are essentially connected. Looks like everyone helps each other out there, I only say this cause I noticed different people filling up waters at our table. Been to this location a few times and the service is always consistent each visit. Would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in east valley.  Get the Damn Good, Las Vegas and Diamondback.  Great tasting and fresh.  Great happy hour as well.  Kailee was a great waitress!!!"}
{"text":"Echoing several others reviews - OK service, decent sushi but pricey for what it is, unnecessarily loud music, and a mixed crowd of people trying to impress each other.  Better value and sushi can be had elsewhere without the obnoxious surroundings."}
{"text":"Very creative menu with traditional fare."}
{"text":"Sushi Brokers is located in the happening heart of Gilbert but it's lacking when it comes to it's name.  We went to Sushi Brokers for their half off anniversary and I have to say I was not impressed.   When it comes to sushi, I look for originality, price and freshness. Although the rolls were pretty fresh, most of the rolls were all the same. They typically all had either spicy crab, avocado or salmon in them.   We ordered a couple of rolls; the surf and turf, las vegas, the darn good roll, the scallop roll, and the California Club. Out of all the rolls, the scallop roll, Philly and Vegas roll were the best. Typically a Vegas roll has eel sushi with unagi sauce but this roll utilized Salmon instead. It was actually pretty good considering. The scallop roll was second best but I didn't actually enjoy any of the other rolls. The california club was spicy so I couldn't enjoy it and the darn good roll was forgettable.  We also tried the Crab Rangoons which were alright but the taste was off.   When we received the bill it was pretty substantial but thankfully it was half off. If I went there on a different night I wouldn't have wanted to pay those high prices for just okay sushi. Other than that, the atmosphere is nice and it is in a nice area. I just feel there are better sushi places around the valley."}
{"text":"One of the better bar atmospheres in a sushi restaurant. Yellowtail nigiri was excellent... be sure you request the cilantro on top of it. The rolls were above average for freshness and flavor. They have a roll called the \"Damn good roll\" and I recommend it.  Good pours on drinks all evening as well."}
{"text":"Only go here for happy hour. Period.  Seriously overpriced if you don't go for happy hour.  Luckily, happy hour occurs seven days a week.  Both a normal and reverse happy hour.  Don't go crazy.  This place doesn't have the best quality fish.  Don't order uni, don't order ama ebi... just stick to the basics and rolls  The rolls and sauces on the stuff they serve though... are AWESOME!  So yeah, if you want some sushi \"junk food\" topped with creamy delicious and spicy sauces... dig in! Lots of fried rolls on the menu too, so I truly think of it as a very rich and fattening sushi experience :)  Ta da!"}
{"text":"My fiancé placed an order at 7:45 and was quoted a time of 15 minutes. I showed up around 805 and our order was still not ready; they told me it would be about 10 more minutes. There were maybe 6-8 people in the entire restaurant. When I got the last of my order it was wrong. They asked if I wanted them to fix it, of course, I said yes. I had ordered the yakisoba with beef and there was no beef. The manager on duty told me he wouldn't charge me for the beef as his apology. Another 10 minutes later, I got my dish. While driving home I started to smell the noodles and when I got home, I realized that they packed the box upside down and all the noodles had leaked out of the bag and on the floor of my car. I called the restaurant to let them know what had happened and the manager asked me to come back and get a gift card and maybe they could refund my card. The manager then said he couldn't find my check and made it seem like there was nothing else he could do. This was my first time trying sushi brokers and it will likely be my last time. Far too much money for that quality of food and service. Good sushi is worth good money but bad food and service is not."}
{"text":"I asked the server which roll she recommended she told me the sunshine roll. Best sushi roll I have had in a long time! Service was great. Food was great. Drinks were great. Will definitely be back for more. Shout out to the excellent server Kylie!"}
{"text":"Sushi was good, but the reason why I gave it a 2 was the appetizer was awful.  We ordered the calamari and it was a cheap version of a microwaved dish.  Overly breaded and the calamari was very rubber.  We had 4 other sushi rolls for our main course and they were a lot better.  We came just in time for happy hour and the Moscow mule was awesome the second time around."}
{"text":"With a modest exterior, Sushi Brokers  was a wonderful surprise for what we found inside (modern design, great service).  As a fan of sushi happy hours this place made us ALL super happy, including our tummies, my wallet, et al. The bonus here is that the happy hour not only last till 6:30 but they boast a robust list of rolls, apps and bevvies at a discount. When we are back in Arcadia next, count us IN!"}
{"text":"Not only does Sushi Brokers host happy hour, but also reverse happy hour (10PM-Close).  There's plenty of parking outside of this location as well as a decent amount of seating inside.  Sushi Brokers has become a staple in my diet for fulfilling my late night sushi cravings, (after a few drinks of course), during reverse happy hour. Surprisingly, there's a variety of options that seem to appeal to almost anyone on their happy hour/reverse happy hour menu.  The best part about Sushi Brokers is the atmosphere. There's certainly a youthful and modern appeal with a killer soundtrack that makes you want to stick around for a while, (especially if you're drinking).  I plan on buying sushi here until I'm broke... Wait a second... I knew the name of this place was fishy..."}
{"text":"The Custer service and ambiance is top touch. We ordered the spring rolls as appetizers. They were very good. For dinner we had the Surfer and Cowboy rolls. It was so good, I over eat. No regrets. I would return and recommend this place."}
{"text":"Should a food be authentic or taste good?  Ideally both but I lean towards taste and things were tasting good.  I was here for happy hour 5-6:30 on a Sat night which is rare to have a happy hr on a sat night. Happy hr prices are not bad but not a bargain, Basic rolls are $4 and fancy rolls are $8.25  the veggie tempura is a decent deal at $4 as are long islands.  I had a las vegas roll, which here is made with avocado and smoked salmon, far from usual but the smokiness of the salmon with the fattiness of the avocado work so well. The spicy tuna was good but nothing special. I tried a piece of my friends cowboy roll which is smothered in a chipotle mayo and quite pleasing.   Sure this makes sushi less healthy, and not very authentic but it was good and the prices were eh ok at happy hour.  The music was a bit loud but I could still converse with my friends."}
{"text":"Love the place, I think the owner is the cashier. Always on top of his game in bringing my water. One thing though which the inside had more gusto. Food is good and ok priced. I go often there will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Happy Hour is terrific!  Food is fresh and great atmosphere here!  Parking not the greatest, but that has nothing to do with the quality of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in for post work out happy hour (gotta balance things out, right?). All I can say is it was meh. Haven't been here in a while and it just seems.....tired. It's also VERY LOUD - like you can barely hear the person who is sitting right across the table from you loud. And the tables are sticky.   Anyhow - they have a decent selection of rolls on their sushi menu - we ordered a house salad with ginger dressing (not on the happy hour menu), a California roll with masago and the surfer roll, which is nearly $13 on the happy hour menu). The salad was barely there (like one slice of cucumber and a small handful of lettuce barely there) but what was there was good. The CA roll was good. It had a decent amount of masago which I love. The spicy shrimp and krab mixture that topped the surfer roll was yummy but a little too liquidy and it made the roll underneath it soggy and fall apart. I think there are plenty more places to get sushi in a much nicer setting with less sticky tables where it's easier to have a conversation with the people you are with."}
{"text":"The food was literally amazing!!! Definitely one of my new favorite sushi places in Arizona! I ended up ordering the spicy garlic edamame and surf n turf roll - TOO GOOD."}
{"text":"The sushi is probably the best in the area.  The rolls were good and varied.  Family friendly and upbeat atmosphere.  It's not inexpensive, but when it comes to sushi, if it is then you probably shouldn't eat it...  Okay, I just had a \"Gus Roll\" at SB and it is awesome.  Never had anything like it before.  It's not on the menu, but think of it as super-sized Adkins sushi blast.  Do yourself a favor and order one..."}
{"text":"Went there last Friday at 3pm.. Only people in place were 3 men at bar. The sushi chef just motioned for us to sit anywhere. Waited almost 5 minutes for waitress to finally come over with menus. It was Happy Hour at the moment and so we ordered sushi from that menu. Sushi was OK. Waitress came by once and didn't refill our water. A male (not sure if it was manager) came by and did it. After we were done eating she took our plates but never returned with a check. Waited another 5-7 minutes and flagged her down to bring check. (Mind you there was still only 3 people in restaurant) finally the same guy that refilled our water came and picked up check to check us out. All while waitress stood at bar talking to another girl. Just wish she was a lil more attentive. Wouldn't be going back again."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely always delicious! The lollipop roll is my favorite but I love that they have so many spicy options on the menu. I've had the good fortune of having Suzi as my server my last three visits and she gives impeccable service. She deserves her very own five star review!"}
{"text":"I really love this place for happy hour. As we all know sushi can be expensive, especially in a land locked state like AZ. Enjoying HH here makes eating sushi affordable for me. I've eating here many times and have just forgotten to give them a review. I've always received great service from the wait staff and the food is very good. The food is served quickly too. The Surfer roll is one of my favorites; during HH it's about $13 and is a full meal for me, although we usually share it. They also offer a sushi pizza that I've never had but it looks intriguing.  My complaint about this place is the music; it's just too loud for conversation. I really like the mix they play but I wish they would turn it down a few notches... without fail my voice is always strained the next day from having to yell a conversation here to the person sitting next to me. They have decent house wines I think... and just note that if you are looking for an every-day domestic beer they don't really have any like Bud or Miller. But hey, have a Budda beer with a saki shooter while enjoying your meal."}
{"text":"The food was vey good. They were packed when we went but they found us a spot for 8 in the bar area. Unfortunately the music was so loud we couldn't really talk to anyone at the other end of the table and the bathrooms were super gross. I know they were busy but someone needed to be paying much more attention to the restrooms."}
{"text":"Sushi was ok, good portion size but room temp raw fish is always a little sketchy. The problem was the fact that we sat at the bar and saw way too much. The bartenders never washed their hands, which were all over everything. I watched one guy make a drink and he touched the ice, the cucumber and fruit in the drink, and every square inch of the straw (for some unknown reason) with his bare hands. A server was sorting around the little container of lemons and limes with her inch long finger nails. I'm not a germ-a-phobe, but it grossed me out. The sushi chefs did fine until the last roll. One of them took his gloves off and handled two different raw fish, plus rice and vegetables. They also set a plate on top of a sheet of cucumber, placed a roll on that plate, then made a different roll using that cucumber sheet. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The best sushi place ever. Fresh, happy hour 7 days/week and even a reverse happy hour.  Surfer roll and Damn Good roll are the best. Order a Pegalicious to wash it all down. Been coming 10 years and love this place! Both locations have nice atmosphere depending on ur mood. Ask for Johnny.  He's the best.  He will take good care of u."}
{"text":"I love this place. It was my first time eating there. The california rolls and philly rolls were so yummy and delicious. Friendly staff and great service as well. Great location too."}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour with a coworker. Food was insanely good at a very good value. The restaurant offers happy hour from 3-6 7 days a week. I recommend the spicy ahi and the tootsie rolls. Amazing service as well."}
{"text":"While the price point is high for this sushi joint, considering the part of town and the amazing sushi, It's worth it. They are open later than most places in town, which is nice for the night owls hiding in us. The hamachi kama is the best in town. I even brought my Asian friend here and she was definitely on board with that one! The one roll we didn't like they took off of our bill without hassle. I'll be returning over and over - I live pretty close, and it beats the sushi that's closer to me hands down!"}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant. Fancy rolls served here.  We ordered the half size sushi pizza and it was very tasty.  Restaurant clean and modern."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is my boyfriend and I's go to spot for Sushi. They have a great variety, and as someone who does not eat raw fish, I love how many options they have with shrimp, crab, and lobster. I would have to say I eat here once a month and I will continue to go here."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this location to open and I've been holding off from writing a review for quite sometime.Today I ordered spicy salmon and spicy yellow tail for a takeout and I am very disappointed by the quality of the fish and the amount that was put in the rolls. The rolls were not spicy at all. I gave it a two because the front staff was amazing! If it was only for the food I would have given it one star."}
{"text":"Hmmm... what to say... have been here twice in the past 5 weeks.  The first time was late afternoon on a Sunday.  The sushi was ok, and because it was happy hour, not that expensive... if I had to base the review on this one time it would have been a 3 star, but the second time was yesterday.  We went at dinner time and the place was packed.  I really can't understand why.  We had the Ebi and Kani, as well as the California, Scallop, and Crunchy rolls... the California and Crunchy rolls were good, but I've had as good at at least a dozen other sushi restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  The scallop roll, ebi and kani were simply not good.    The service was good and attentive, which is why this gets a 2 star, rather than 1."}
{"text":"I have to say that I'm a big fan of Sushi Brokers. I am what they call a pansy sushi eater - i.e. i think a California Roll made with soy paper counts as sushi, and the very smell of fish makes me nauseated. However; more than one time now, I have been able to try affordable sushi, that doesn't stink, and tastes really mild and yummy. And that to me is a total win. The service has been less than good on all occassions, but the happy hour pricing and great food makes it worth the try."}
{"text":"Came for a quick lunch on a rainy day in day in Scottsdale. I have been here before so I know they have an amazing love burger.   I also tried their lunch special bento box.  I chose the surfer special roll.   I have not been here in over a year and I am sorry to resort that the burger is not as great  as it used to be. The meat is tougher and the flavor is just not there.  It used to be one of the best burgers in town.  :(  I am very pleased that the sushi was still amazing.  Super fresh and so delicious.   The service was top notch.   Next time I will just stick with the wonderful sushi."}
{"text":"Not recommended. There are a ton of restaurants steps away with way better service and better food. Do not learn this lesson the hard way. The stars we gave are actually for the busboy who found the time, while bussing tables and mopping and the hundred other things he was doing, to get us soy sauce and wish us a good night.   The food was fine. Noodles were good in that MSG sorta way. The sushi looked good.  We are trying to figure out what will be our regular spot and unfortunately we will most likely never come here again. We could have easily spent hundreds a month, if not thousands a year, through being regulars. And now, just because the waitstaff could not get their act together for a few minutes the business owner loses out.   Does it really take more than a few minutes to seat us and give us a run down if it's our first time? Does it really?  If you are open until 11, is the waitstaff aware you are?  Is the waitstaff/hostess aware customers can see them?  Literally \"doing the least\"."}
{"text":"Sushi Brokers is by far, my favorite sushi place in The Valley. I've been to quite a few different sushi restaurants, but Sushi Brokers has never disappointed. The location is great for those who live in the North Valley.   The selection of sushi is fantastic, and the best ones are the Chimichanga Roll & the Sanchez Roll. They even beat the Las Vegas roll (although that one is amazing too). The price is a little high, but it's a nice place, with a unique blend of sushi & sports bar vibes. Compared to Ra, the food is probably a tad bit better at Sushi Brokers, but only because of the unique southwest influenced rolls. So in the end, it's worth $14 for a rather large Chimi roll (we had 10 large pieces one time, instead of the usual 5 at Ra).   My only debbie-downer about this place is the size. It's super tiny, and even though we have been seated right away every time, I'm waiting for the day that we have to go somewhere to kill some time while a seat opens up."}
{"text":"Good Sushi. But u kept getting the feeling the sushi chefs were taking about all the customers while they did shots kneeling down behind the bar."}
{"text":"the server has no idea what alcohol they had available..... and the fact that the pretentious bar tender didn't know how to make a proper Manhattan was laughable. the sushi itself was sub par considering all the hype. definitely not returning unless I'm forced to. bleh."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere hip music reasonable prices such a great addition to downtown Gilbert  Can't wait to return with a group of friends"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food is ok. The last time I visited was on a Sunday. There were two other tables eating in the entire place. No one greeted us for 2-3 minutes when we walked in even though there was numerous staff behind the bar. Someone finally came around and told us to sit wherever we would like. We sat at a small booth across from the bar. The smell of cigarettes was very strong. After 9 minutes a hostess finally came around and asked if we wanted anything to drink. 7 minutes later she brought us water and quickly walked away. Flash forward 8 more minutes and the hostess came back and asked if anyone had taken our order. We replied no, and at this point I didn't care to eat because of the cigarette smell. My boyfriend ordered two spicy tuna rolls from her. 15 minutes later when our water glasses were empty we flagged down someone and asked if we could get more water and where our food was. 5 minutes later the person clearing tables brought us our food. A blonde waitress and bartender walked past us out a side door and didn't return for about ten minutes. When they returned and walked past ignoring us it was clear where the cigarette smell was coming from. It was very potent. No one ever returned to our table and I made eye contact with the waitress numerous times who was shaking her body behind the bar at the bartender who she went outside to smoke with. We finally asked the bus boy for our check. He was very friendly and the only positive experience. We finally left after paying our bill and all the staff was \"hanging\" out behind the bar and didn't even acknowledge us when we left. I don't care if it's their personal choice to smoke, but I shouldn't have to smell it during my entire meal."}
{"text":"Great service.  Good happy hour prices and items.  Didn't really enjoy the sushi and salad.  The house salad was bitter and salty, I returned it and the waitress comped it (which was sweet of her).  I'm a sushi lover and this place didn't cut it."}
{"text":"NON SUSHI EATER!!!  Ok so I don't eat sushi, but the 3 people with me did!  They loved it.  I had noodles and the chicken wings.  Yes....chicken wings.  Delicious.  The service was spot on! Location was very nice.  I, a non sushi eater, would come back."}
{"text":"So another try, but this time was worse.  I admit that I waited for this review because I had mixed feelings of posting an experience like this; however  I decided I believe it's important to know where you spend your lunches and/or dinners and where your money is going.    While we were sitting at the restaurant sharing wine with the two owners, one of the owners stated that he \"hated ni**ers, Jews, spics, muslims, and the gays.\"  We were appalled.  We got up and walked out and I have to say quickly before I couldn't hold my tongue.  How dare anyone say something like this.  If you fall or don't fall in this so-called category, pass this place up.  This is awful for the community and encourages hate.  100% verbatim from the owner's mouth - this is where your hard-earned dollars go to.  I'm disgusted.  I will never return and I will continue to share this experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my favor spot. You have to try  \"surfer roll or damn good the name says all\". Mango martini is really good. Recommendation go on happy hour other wise it will b a little  expensive."}
{"text":"Favor sushi spot. You must have volcano chicken, surfer, las Vegas, Philly, and my favor of all time \"Damn good\" the name says all and for drink mangotinny is pretty good. Advise go on happy hour 3 to 7 or 10 to close you will save your self a lot $$."}
{"text":"Overpriced, & stingy on the fish. No lunch specials. I'm going back to Sakana, which has STELLAR lunch deals."}
{"text":"I give 2 stars because the food was somewhat ok but the service is by far the worst service I have had in a very long time. It was SLOW. She never came to check on us. I had to wave her over to order my food. We didn't get sushi tonight because we were trying to be quick. We had teriyaki chicken, which was decent, and lettuce wraps, which were also ok. Not impressed and won't be returning. Especially not with my kids. I don't know why it says good for kids? There's no kids menu and the veggies on the teriyaki plate were spicy and too hard for my babies to eat. The price is ok. $15 for each teriyaki plate and $10 for chicken lettuce cups."}
{"text":"My fave sushi place in AZ! They have great wines by the glass... Silver Oak!! ... and the rolls are delicious - try the Surfer roll you will not be dissapointed :)"}
{"text":"Best sushi ever!!! I'm not sure how they don't have better reviews. I've tried all of these other sushi places that people rant about but they're never as good as Sushi Brokers. You haven't lived until you've tried a Damn Good, Chimichunga & cowboy!!! Highly recommended! They also have delicious fried rice."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place.  I wish they would come out to CA!  I crave the Diamondback roll and the Dynamite Chicken (which is like lean chicken cubes w/ buffalo wing sauce over rice).  I try to visit whenever I am in town.  XOXOXOXO"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant! The location in DT Gilbert is closer than traveling to the Arcadia or Scottsdale location. This is by far my favorite sushi restaurant in the valley. Happy hour prices on rolls and happy hour are great!! I walked into the restaurant at just past 6:30 and after the hostess sat us down she rushed back to say she's going to give the waitress a quick happy hour order from us in case we wanted the cheaper prices... Since happy hour had already 'ended\" we were pleasantly surprised and very appreciative! Volcano chicken and calamari on happy hour are a must have. The rolls are always super delicious and the freshness of the fish is without a doubt recognize-able. I will return time and time again!!"}
{"text":"I went with a friend who's a regular. I really enjoyed the rolls and everything appeared fresh. Service was attentive. Great for an after work crowd and as long as you can stand the busy noise, it's good. You may have to yell a bit but the specials are worth it. Clean and enjoyable."}
{"text":"The food has really gone downhill.  I used to go here all the time when I lived on that side of town but the last few times I've gone the sushi was horrible.  Maybe it was an off day? I might venture back to see if this was the case."}
{"text":"My husband and his doctor both got food poisoning after eating here. My husband was in the hospital for two days and almost died!  Told a friend at work, and they said they got food poisoning at sushi Brokers as well. This was a very expensive dinner when you add in the hospital bills. Used to eat here a lot, but no more!"}
{"text":"Compared to the various other cookie cutter Sushi spots, this one really stands out. The happy hour is to die for considering location and the general prices in Scottsdale. The quality of the sushi is also much different compared to general places out here. You will see that the prices at general times are very pricey for certain dishes ($15 for a seven piece roll?!?!).   One thing to point out is that this was the first time in around 2 years since i had come back. The wait staff on the last occasion were so poor that my date and I chose to leave. It seemed like a good idea, because the 20 something waitress was caught in her own bubble egregiously flirting with  five 40 year old dudes. So, to say the least, the service has gotten better than when I last went. The past few times I had gone I also was provided the typical snobby reactions that you get from wait-staff in Scottsdale. Much different this time. Our waitress was kind and understood where we were all coming from (I was in a party of 4). So at least from this time around the waitress was good.  I guess in Yelp language that would mean the service is \"hit or miss\", haha.  Anyway, despite the service the food is well worth any issues I have previously had. The only major hang up I won't let go is that it's truly not worth it at regular times, unless you have that type of money to go through. Sushi selection though, is top notch and this is one of my fav's when I am in the area and really craving sushi. Please try to make your first trip one to their happy hour so you can breathe a little easier when browsing the menu. If you like it, then maybe you can inch into regular hours."}
{"text":"Great sushi joint. Reverse happy hour for late evenings is awesome! Just went the other evening with a group of 8 and was fun and lively! Check to see if Hannah is working and get sat in her section. She's an awesome server, patient, friendly, and quick!"}
{"text":"Better THIS time! It's taken me a while to come back even though it's in my hood and I love me some sushi...buuuuut...mediocre sushi and expensive prices is mos def on my no no list! The waitress was awesome...and the prices were just right because I was there this past Sunday for happy hour. The veggie tempura was delish and my spicy tuna and philly roll tasted fresh. The iced tea was super refreshing as well."}
{"text":"Last time I went it was lunchtime on a weekday.  Our server was very quick and attentive.  The sushi lunch deal was *amazing.*  Piping hot miso, delicate seaweed salad, crisp cucumber salad, flavorful sauteed veggies, fresh orange slices and the main attraction - tuna, yellowtail and salmon all absolutely fresh and perfectly prepared.  I left totally stuffed and happy.  One caveat - they should turn down the music a little during lunch; happy hour should be one level of noise and lunch should be several octaves below that."}
{"text":"This would have to be some of the best sushi I've ever had. I am constantly begging my boyfriend and friends to come here with me because everything is always spot on. The garlic truffle edamame is melt in your mouth good, I order it every time I visit. The fish is always as fresh as it gets, love how they don't cut it super thick, it's always just right! Love the tuna poke bowl and sunshine roll! The best rolls in town by far, just about everything I've ever tried here is delicious.       Love how attentive the servers are, they are all such sweet girls. The owner Jeff even brought in fancy wine glasses for our favorite wines.. And.. if your a wineo, they have the best wine list on the downtown strip, with the best prices you will find, no mark up here.     It's just the BEST. LOVEEEE YOU SUSHI BROKERS!!  #killinit"}
{"text":"They were slammed tonight but did a great job of getting everybody their food.  Chill place.  Nice staff."}
{"text":"Ok, not great. Best part were the appetizers (crab wontons and fried dumplings). My favorite drink to order when I go out for sushi is an extra dirty vodka martini, which I ordered here of course! Unfortunately, I had to send it back in exchange for a beer and saki (I hate doing things like that, but the waitress was fantastic about it!!!). The rolls we ordered were Alright (cowboy roll and something with shrimp on top). The atmosphere and seating arrangements were undesirable... The place could use a better layout and better bartender. Overall, food was alright, not my favorite sushi, but, service was good!"}
{"text":"I came to this place last night to order sushi to go..made my order at the bar with the manager and he suggested that they could make a rainbow roll with mostly shrimp on top rather than the usual and i humbly accepted. 20 dollars and 38 mins later i watched the chef make the roll regular. So i waited until they bagged the order and handed the order to me to say that the order was wrong the manager got irate with the chef there chef remade the order the manager takes the order 7 minutes later throws the food in the bag and slid the food to me and walked off no sorry no thanks no anything. I asked for the number for the gm on the way out the door at this point i decided i was not going to eat the food. Got him decided to get ready for bed and received a call back from the gm who was nice and agreed that the service was unacceptable. Feeling better i decided that rather than discard the meat i would eat. Popped the entire piece of  roll in my mouth chew chew go to swallow and i gag.. there had been a full piece of plastic rolled in the roll.. pull the plastic out..decided this can't be real popped the second piece in my mout yep u guessed! There was plastic there two they measured at 3 inches wides by 7 inches long so these was not scrapes this was wrapping from the seaweed i assume i texted he pictures to the gm having had his number and he was not happy. But that does not really help. I think this is really an awful situation. While he did say he would return my 20 that i paid for the sushi roll plus tip. I feel like there should be much more done in this situation. If you look at the reviews they are failing miserably."}
{"text":"Loved it here! Great atmosphere! Good music and more of a loud bar type scene. The place was packed on Saturday night so bar seating it was. The rolls were fresh and delish! I don't drink so I don't know how the drinks were... but a friend got a Corona and it was huge LOL... not sure why it was like a double sized Corona but I guess that's good? Pretty chill spot, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Only ever been here for lunch... wish I could get out for a happy hour.   The Sushi is great, and the atmosphere is even better. I try to order 1 different roll with every visit - so I can go through them all. I have never been disappointed with any of them so far. Caterpiller Roll, Lollipop Roll, and Samba Roll are my favorites so far.   If you are into eye candy - this is the place to hang. Make sure to get a good seat with a \"view\". Only downside - tend to see allot of the 50+ with 25 and under types - and they are being a little to friendly to be father daughter. But hey - its Scottsdale!  As for drinks - only ever had 1 - Fallen Samurai... which is their version of a spicy bloody mary. WOW -- it was good.   I will be back - only wish I could go more often."}
{"text":"Once is not enough  Today, I decided I wanted Sushi for lunch and was told by a coworker that Sushi Brokers served the best tasting Sushi in Phoenix.  Initially, I was skeptical because I am very particular when it comes to Sushi, but I decided to give Sushi Brokers a try and I am so glad I did.  Unlike most sushi restaurants that have very limited seating at the bar, Sushi Brokers understands it's more fun to watch the chefs arrange their delicious creations and  have plenty of seating at the bar.   My lunch companions and I feasted on Cowgirl Sushi Rolls, Crunchy Rolls, Surfer Rolls, Lollipop Rolls, and spicy edamame. All our entrée's were fresh and absolutely delicious.  My favorite was the Cowgirl rolls which are made with Yellowtail, layered on top of a Sushi roll, with Spicy Hot Sauce on top.   The sushi was fresh, delicious and artfully presented. The atmosphere inside Sushi Brokers is inviting and, a bit upbeat. The service at Sushi Brokers can be a little slow however, we enjoyed our visit and the clientele  are very friendly. You can't go wrong at Sushi Brokers."}
{"text":"I was so excited for the long awaited Sushi Brokers to open in Arcadia.   I fully expected it would be my new local \"go-to\" sushi place, as it is just a few blocks from my office and from my home.      We've gone for lunch and have hit it up for evenings on several occasions.   Overall, the food is good and the service is quality.  The only qualm I have is on the price.  Very few lunch specials ($15 Bento box) so it's definitely not somewhere we can go frequently as it is definitely beyond my lunch budget.   They do have a good happy hour, but otherwise the prices are higher than other places around.    Nonetheless - the important part - FOOD!  The sushi seems very fresh and they have some great, creative rolls to try (Cowboy, Cowgirl).  Tootsie roll is always a favorite.  Spicy tuna roll is my favorite, and they definitely do this one very well - great flavor and just the right amount of heat!  The Bento box with sushi is a good and filling lunch option (with miso soup, veggies, an orange).  Tuna Tataki was a great choice.   The sashimi is good, but the portions are on the smaller side in comparison with other sushi places in the area.   Food: 4 stars Service: 4 stars Price: 2 stars  Overall:  3.5 stars  With that said, happy hour is definitely the time to go enjoy Sushi Brokers.   There is regular happy hour until about 6:30, I believe, and then a reverse happy hour that starts at 10 pm.  I just wish there were better lunch deals or locals had discount options - or even daily specials would be great.   Until then...expect Biltmore or North Scottsdale prices and plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Not a big fan. Somehow have been here 3 times for lunch and each time it is just mediocre. I keep ordering the sushi lunch special and it's just never that great. This last time, it was very slow at lunch and it took forever to get our food. I probably should just give up on this place. I don't know how I managed to eat here again as I told my co worker on the way there that I didn't like it.  Hunger addles my brain."}
{"text":"If you drink enough, you should be able to eat the fish here.  You'll be okay if you stick to the rolls and the tuna.  Anything else is not recommended.  This place is only for the most pedestrian of sushi palates."}
{"text":"Overpriced poor quality sushi. I love the Scottsdale Sushi Brokers.. this one sucked. Small rolls. Small cuts of sashimi. The cuts of steak on the surf and turf were much smaller than I typically get. They tried to disguise the undersized roll and steak under a pile of onions, which were good. The steak actually seemed boiled it was so rubbery. I mentioned this to our server and he just laughed it off and said he was sorry. I expect to spend $$$ on good sushi . $64 for a 12 pc sashimi and 2 rolls with 2 waters seemed excessive for the poor quality.  The other roll with lobster dynamite was delicious. I put a $100 dollar bill in the check. Our server looked at it and said you don't need any change right... right.. enjoy my smaller than my usual tip. This place just landed on my list of chain restaurants I choose not to visit.  Oh... and I woke up at 3 am thanksgiving day with apparent food poisoning..  just lowered you to a 1 star  :/"}
{"text":"Really great service, great sushi and happy hour menu.  Good dinner crowd and nice menu with both sushi and entree selections   Our server Kahili went out of her way to explain the menu and made some great recommendations.    We will be back"}
{"text":"Food was okay and service was good. Is this place worthy of more then 3 stars? Not really. There is really nothing too special about this place; typical sushi restaurant.   On a side note: our waitress was very pretty & kind too. That of course made eating average sushi a little more enjoyable :P  Anywho, this place is A-OK! Nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"I love to sit in the bar here. Bartenders are very attentive & attractive. Every time I go it is a must to get yummy roll. I will eat it all by myself I love that it doesn't have any rice. The lollipop  roll is another favorite with no rice. When I go with my sister we will get volcano  chicken it is really good & you can catch it on happy hour we sub the rice for steamed veggies."}
{"text":"Sushi brokers has very quickly become a new favorite dining experience for my Fiancé and I. We discovered this place wanting to find a great sushi spot and so far we enjoy it every time. If you go during happy hour, that's when you will get the best bang for your buck. (6:30pm is when happy hour ends I believe.) I have to say the quality of the food and the flavors is what keeps us coming back. Beautiful presentations especially on our favorite dish (The Surfer) It makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  The staff could be a little more professional, they are all blonde hair Scottsdale preppy young girls. Could the management who hires them get anymore cliché? So half of them don't seem to have a clue what they are doing half the time. However, other than that minor complaint, it's the food that keeps us coming back. They still get the job done even with the minor errors here and there. Like bringing the entrees before the appetizers. Things like that don't happen often so it can be easily overlooked.  Overall you get quality food and tasty ingredients. Must try if you have never been and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi, good miso soup, but the lettuce in the lettuce wraps was wilted and brown. Maybe it would've been more fresh had it not been ordered to go, or if they put it in a separate box from the chicken itself. Also, my order was $23, gave the bartender $40 and he almost didn't give me my change until I asked... sheisty!"}
{"text":"Overall we liked the sushi we got. The crab (kani) wasn't properly secured with a large enough portion of seaweed and basically fell apart when touched.   The chimichanga rolls and the Vegas rolls were delicious. The portions weren't bad, but the prices were still VERY expensive for the portion size of the roll.  Our server was perfect and lovely. She kept our drinks filled so we didn't have to ask, and made a great dessert suggestion, which made my boyfriend happy. It was so appealing the table next to us ordered the same dessert and loved it too."}
{"text":"This is restaurant is one of my favorite places to go for sushi. I only go at happy hour, however, because it is much MUCH more affordable.   My favorite rolls are The Damn Good (the name does not lie), The Tootsie, The Vegas, and the Philly! The Long Island Iced Teas are wonderful, and the atmosphere is not bad. I like it as sort of pre-Scottsdale club sort of place (loud music, big flat screes, etc.).   I don't really like that the rolls come out on the same plates because it makes group outings pretty difficult. The service isn't fantastic either, but you can't argue with the prices."}
{"text":"WOW! We came here last minute for sushi and we are so glad to have found a fairly priced, amazing sushi place. Higgggghly recommend the Wok Bowl/Udon.   Huge thanks for the info and suggestions to Nadja - she was the best. Sweet and knowledgeable.  Needless to say, we will be back. :)"}
{"text":"First let me say, the place is clean and the staff is nice. But beyond that its just okay.  The food taste okay, it's nothing wow or to die for.  I've been there 5 times or so by the request of my friend that loves the place.  But to me its highly expensive and most Sushi joints sell the same menu and I've been places where the same thing is cheaper and taste better.  Just because it's in scottsdale, doesn't mean the food is better or it taste better.  You can get the same stuff somewhere else more affordable and better tasting.  I guess it's so expensive because it's scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Friendly staff, great food and service!  I always order the Yummy, Surfer and Cowgirl.  Great happy hour."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, great service and a beautiful view.  Loved the Hawaiian roll."}
{"text":"Very good food,great atmosphere, very professional and great service. Prices were very reasonable and lots of TVs. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hours specials on appetizers, rolls and drinks from 3 to 6:30pm and then again from 10pm to close! We had a slow start to our evening. While we were sat immediately after arriving, no one came to our table for 20 minutes. Then we said something to the hostess and promptly received a service.   Our waitress, Tavi, was great considering it was a busy Friday night. Shout out to her for doing a wonderful job and hooking us up with the beautiful dessert for the birthday at our table. We had a large table of 10 people so there was a bit of a wait again before food came out but when it did it looked and tasted great! The portions were HUGE and we took plenty of leftovers home.   A couple people at our table cannot eat seafood due to allergies (myself included) and I was pleasantly surprised at all the non-seafood options offered at Sushi Brokers. Despite a couple hiccups at the beginning of the meal, overall it was good dining experience and I would go back."}
{"text":"Not impressed one bit. The staff looks homeless. The nigiri was warm and the rolls mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch here today, and I am not usually one to go for sushi. This place may make me consider it more often. Everything we tried was excellent and seemed fresh. A tad pricey but overall a great place."}
{"text":"This place is a few miles from where I work so I've stopped in a few times. The thing is: their rolls are SO SMALL. I've eaten at places that are cheaper with either bigger rolls or smaller price tags. The only thing I would recommend is their happy hour. It starts at 10 and has some decent drinks and makis. Get your moneys worth for $5."}
{"text":"wonderful lunch special. the tea is awesome. the atmosphere is comfortable, laid back, and inviting. if you're looking for a decent lunch without being too expensive, this place is perfect. recommended for anyone who likes sushi :)"}
{"text":"If you don't like Sushi Brokers..... you don't know good sushi! {no offense, well, maybe a little offense haha}. Great happy hour, fresh sushi and original rolls - the lollipop is the absolute BEST!!!!"}
{"text":"Really cold beer!  Nice atmosphere, friendly wait staff...and that's where it ends.  Had lettuce wraps, edamame, miso soup and a roll.   All were just average.  Be warned they are very heavy handed with peanut oil.  Not my favorite flavor and it seemed to overpower...even all over edamame.  Doubt we'll return.  Not what we had hoped it would be."}
{"text":"Crab wantons were awesome, pot stickers were great, calamari was good, salmon was just above average but the atmosphere was comfortable. We will be back for sushi next time."}
{"text":"We heard this was a good sushi place and since we were doing a staycation at JW Marriott nearby we tried it. I was not impressed. There was nothing really wrong with the sushi but its way over priced and the servings are miniscule. I paid $14.50 for a caterpillar which was no more than 1.5\" in Diameter and only 8\" long. I could hardly find the eel in it. I paid $13.50 for some Yellowtail sashimi. There were 8, 1\"x2\" rectangles, and very thin. they wanted $3.50 for edaname! The place is nice. The service was good, but they brought my wife's entree about 5 minutes after my sushi so I had to let mine sit while we waited. I believe this place is higher than RA and not nearly as good."}
{"text":"Great food Fast service Consistant cooks Clean resturant Good music playing Waitresses and educated in their menu and nice"}
{"text":"Looks like it should be a lot better than it actually is. Sushi Brokers feels like a chain in a mall - where nothing is great. Oh yes, it's edible, but why settle for mediocre?  This is the kind of place where people go to get drinks and have some sushi too - with the emphasis on the drinks, not the sushi.  No, it's not awful - but there is better sushi within a few miles, so why go here?"}
{"text":"Open, nice seating arrangement including outside. Server was attentive and food was really great! Spicy edamame was really good and loved the spicy rolls. Tried a variety of items and all sushi was fresh and appealing to the eye. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Always a good time when we come here. Actually we came twice this weekend for the happy hour. The surfer roll is amazing and so is the spicy scallop nigiri! The drinks are Fantastic too but a lil pricey for happy hour is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.   My family and I come to this Arcadia gem for the sushi and good times."}
{"text":"We came opening night to a great evening and now returned to yet another great meal and atmosphere, accentuated by our lovely waitress Erin.  Erin gave us the perfect amount of space and was very attentive and super friendly, so happy that we have something to ask for every time we return"}
{"text":"This'll probably be the simplest Yelp review you ever read: the food doesn't taste very good here. The atmosphere is also kind of depressing. The staff is pretty helpful, but not very happy."}
{"text":"Me and my girls went out for dinner and had a great time, fish was fresh and ohh so tasty! They even did a special order for a vegetarian roll! They were friendly and patient about or vegetarian questions, as one of our guest was vegetarian.  Highly recommend  for drinks and sushi"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time tonight and absolutely loved it. The sweetest hosts greeted us and sat us right away. We sat on the patio, perfectly warm on this cool night with the heaters. The best part was our server, Christina.  She was very kind and even when she was busy taking an order for a large party she was so sweet. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved the summer roll, cowboy/cowgirl rolls (spicy!) and the sliders were unique and good! Glad we ventured out from our normal spots while in Scotsdale and tried this place. We will definitely be back next spring break!"}
{"text":"This was a most horrible lunch experience.  First of all the restaurant smells like dirty dish water and is dirty dirty dirty.  The table and sake bottle were gross and sticky.  The food!  Horrendous.  I didn't think a California roll could be bad until now.  Forget the horribly over fried spider roll.  And by all means Do Not get the plate of wilted bag lettuce and dark dark colored ahi tuna."}
{"text":"Great food! We tried several different rolls including lollipop, surfer, damn good and chimichanga. The edamame with truffle oil was yum and small portion. Rolls were excellent but cared for chimichanga the least of the 4."}
{"text":"I have lived in AZ for over a decade. Dined at many sushi establishments. I luv sushi and sake! To my surprise Sushi Brokers is the worse establishment I've dined at; since I've eaten sushi- 10 years.  First, I wonder if the waiter has a memory bank the size of a split pea. He over charged my credit card. Simple fix right! No.The rude manager Devan behaved and treated me as if it was my fault. Seriouly? The Manger nor the waiter apologized for this mishap. So they void the charge. Then tried to charge my card again. I have fraud protection on my account. So the bank declined a new charge on my account for the correct amount. So I had to call my bank to confirm the purchase was good. The customer service rep at the bank said, \"We apologize Ms. B, charges too fast and/frequent from the same establishment set off an alert to our system.  When a customer calls in we release the card.\". Not a big deal right. Wrong! Its all about customer service,  the tone of the employees to its customers and how they treat them. This is where Sushi Brokers failed tonight. No apologies. To treat a paying customer rudely during an easy and fixable mistake is bad for business. I will tell my experience at Sushi Brokers to 10 people and they will tell many more. The cycle of storytelling regardless of the experience is powerful and never ends!"}
{"text":"Best Cowgirl and Damn Good rolls in Scottsdale and Sushi Pizza is beyond amazing! HH is the best deal: 3-6 every day. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Decent place for happy hour. Used to come here with colleagues after work. Sushi & drinks are cheaper during happy hour... only reason we used to come here. Sushi and cooked Japanese stuff aren't that great. Go across the street to Ra at Kierlands if you don't mind paying and get better service."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Heart - All I Wanna Do Is Make Love To You)  It was a sunny day When it came into sight Standing on Scottsdale road, no fancy signs, no shade So I pulled up along inside and  I gathered I try My friend agreed with a smile So we sat for a while I didn't ask for a drink this Bo Bites at the bar Hey tell me its right Is this love at first sight Please don't make it wrong Just stay for a bite  All I wanna do is go to Sushi Brokers with you Say you will You want me too All I wanna do is go to Sushi Brokers with you I've got an appetite I don't want to hold on to  Sushi Brokers is a staple of North Scottsdale. I still remember when I first moved to Arizona and coming here for Sushi.  I came for Happy Hour again as usual. Always great prices and drink specials! The service is top notch and very welcoming. Lovely hostess and waitress and the waiter and bartenders are always attentive. My gal pal and I ordered their Diamond, Spicy Tuna, Cowboy rolls, and some Calamari. I didn't really care for the Spicy Tuna or the Cowboy rolls. Just seem pretty basic, while the Diamond seemed fun, but in the end it was just a saucy mess; nice tempura crunch however. The Calamari came with a sweet and spicy sauce, I thought it needed to be a little more crispier and subtract the sweetness in the sauce; more spicy and thicker.  In the end, Sushi Brokers always provides a great atmosphere. I didn't really care for the food, but if I'm ever in the North side for Happy Hour; I'll definitely stop by for a few! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love the sushi here which is why I keep coming back, but I've had a couple of bad experiences with service.   My first bad experience was when our server brought us a roll we didn't order. She insisted we did and showed us that we checked it off on the sushi list. It was clear we checked off the one above it, and she had the audacity to tell us,\"oh, well next time be sure to verbally tell your server what it is that you're ordering so this doesn't happen again.\" I've been in the industry for 6 years--as a server, I've always made sure to repeat back the order in case I made a mistake.   My second bad experience wasn't as bad. The server was very nice but she wasn't very attentive, it was hard to flag her down for a refill and our check.   TL;DR: Awesome sushi, hit or miss service."}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago, my brother the local recommended this place.  It was really top notch.  Close to the sushi we get in Chicago.  Pretty amazing menu for rolls! We had the Cowboy, Cowgirl, Crunchy and Sanchez.  The Crunchy was my fav - I love the tempura!  The Sanchez was crazy spicy, like holy cow, it bites you at the end.  But also amazing.    Waitress was super helpful and friendly!  Drinks were pretty darn good too - loved the Pom Martini!  It's a hot spot in Scottsdale, see if you can make reservations, but a drink at the bar and some rolls would be all good too."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for happy hour.   I definitely was not impressed with the sushi.   We had the yellow tail roll and the salmon and tuna nigiri.   The nigiri was okay.  The yellow tail roll, ughhh.   I don't know what made it different.   It just wasn't tasty, and fell apart easily.   Maybe not rolled tight enough?  I ordered a manhattan with Makers Mark whiskey.   That was $11.50.   I don't know the name of the server, but I definitely felt rushed.   She whisked our dishes away as soon as it emptied.   I don't know if she was standing behind us or what.     I mean, she was very nice, friendly and efficient -- maybe a little tooooo efficient.   I felt as though she was trying to turn our table over as fast as she could.  It is my understanding this restaurant's owner owns another restaurant in town.   I'm not sure which one.   Think I'll steer clear of this one."}
{"text":"Went there last night with my guy pal, armed with a Deal Chicken.  The place was packed and lots of fun energy abounds.  I ordered the salmon roe sushi and salmon roll.  He ordered teriyaki salmon with veggies and white rice.  The teriyaki sauce is good.  I'm glad to report it doesn't taste like that whatever that awful stuff is that comes out of a bottle like another Japanese restaurant I've been to, which happens to be trendy and expensive.    He isn't JA and likes his fish cooked.   Alas, it was cooked on the outside, but not on the inside.  YIKES!   We called over the server, Rachael, and she was most apologetic and asked if he wanted to have the same fish cooked more or a complete new meal.  My guy said, \"Whatever is easier.\"  (He surely didn't want to upset the chef!)  Well, they brought out a complete new dinner.  Nice!  Unfortunately, this time it was a little bit too cooked, which could be that the chef wanted to make sure it was cooked, which my guy appreciated.    Back to my sushi, the salmon roe smelled and tasted a bit too fishy.  Those who know what salmon roe tastes like know what I mean.  Yes, it is fish eggs and it is supposed to be fishy, but it's like fish that is heading towards the end of its edible life.  The salmon roll was good.  I'm not real big on those type of rolls.  Me, I like the seafood plain and plopped on a bite-size bit of rice and wrapped in nori.  That's my way of eating sushi.     To make up for the teriyaki and its uncooked condition, the restaurant was kind enough to give us pears with ice cream and whipped cream, topped with a flavorful sauce.  YUMMMM!!   That was fabulously wonderful.  I'm glad I didn't order a lot to eat!   Getting back to our server, Rachel -- Notice I spelled it two different ways since I don't know how she spells her name? -- she was very professional and friendly   When I go back, I hope she is our server again.  She's extremely gracious.  I would go back.  The next time I go, though, I would try the tuna sushi -- no not the rolls; remember, that's not my favorite way of eating sushi -- try the salmon roe sushi again, and whatever else strikes my fancy."}
{"text":"This restaurant has an identity crisis. Is it a sports bar? Is it a sushi restaurant? I don't think the owners even know. The bill was pricy for what we got. Happy hour specials were mediocre compared to neighboring sushi restaurants. Service and quality of food were sub par. We definitely won't return."}
{"text":"Has anyone ever heard of SUSHI PIZZA?!?!  I hadn't either!  So I had to try it out.......  Soooo good!  A must-try if you are sharing with someone!  I ordered a half size, and it was loaded with fresh sushi pieces.  I can't imagine what a full size looks like!! Try one!  You won't regret"}
{"text":"First time to this spot and I am pleasantly enthusiastic about it. The nigiri are topped with very healthy sized slices of fish and very fresh. The rice is perfectly cooked to be sticky enough not to fall apart if you dip it into the soy sauce and then chews wonderfully. The spicy tuna roll had a perfect blend of spice and tuna, without one overpowering the other. The spicy edamame is very spicy and, if you order it combined with garlic, is coated with pieces of chopped garlic. Yum!  Abby was our server and was attentive, efficient, and informative."}
{"text":"Surfer roll w/ jalapenos. Ahhhmazing. Sometimes that alone makes it worth putting up with the packed wkend crowd. When I can't wait, I call ahead, order it to go, take it home = happy me. Not sure as to an 'identity' tho - is it a sushi spot? a sports bar? Eh, I don't really care.. did I mention the surfer roll w/ jalapenos? Service can sometimes be sketchy, music is often too loud - uhm did I mention the surfer roll w/ jalapenos?"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Told us it's just going to be 10 mins wait but we only got seated after 1 hr. Worst is we saw there are at least 4 tables already cleaned up and ready to seat people but we still have to walk up to the hostess to ask her to seat us. They need to improve this."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and was impressed by the great choice of discounted rolls. Tried the chimichunga, tootsie, asparagus, california, and the damn good. First off the \"Damn Good\" was money! The \"Chimichunga\" was a close 2nd for me and the tootsie was outstanding as well! They also had discounted drinks and i had a kirin light with sake. boring i know, Michelle had the Blood Orange Margarita and she thought it was Super smooth and went down too easily. \"It could be a lot of trouble\" was her exact quote.   The staff was also quite good and attentive. The food arrived with no problems even though the restaurant was quite busy. The bartender was very friendly and was able to carry on a conversation while still making drinks. Plus she reminded me of Megan Fox, so thats a plus! They also have a reverse happy hour so you can get your sushi on, later if thats what you are looking for."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have a lil something for all types.  I came at like 10 and got surfer and nigiri as recommended. Allen was the server and he was top notch. I recommend this place and the service was on point."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place for happy hour.  Decent sushi in a hip environment.  I like the music they play.  This last visit my Cal roll, octopus, salmon and tuna selections were just fine. A tall, cold Sapporo is always great.  It seemed that the servers were not quite as cute or friendly as in years past.  Maybe it's just me?"}
{"text":"The food was just OK. I like the location and decor but that's about it."}
{"text":"Solid food, great atmosphere (people and aesthetics). High tops, bar & booths are available. The blonde lanky hostess needs to step up her 'people skills' but beyond that I recommend this place. If you haven't been here I would say give it a try. This is my first time here and I would/will come back.  The end. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I really love this place!! I'm incredibly picky about sushi since I work in a sushi restaurant but the quality here is outstanding. Homemade sauces, all fresh fish (never frozen so they say!), and really wonderful customer service. I always come in during lunch time when there's not a lot of other customers here but still, you can't beat attentive, friendly service. Mario, the sushi chef, is incredible! I love watching him roll sushi, and he's sooooo friendly! There's a server/hostess that works during lunch time too, I wish I had caught her name, but she's seriously the SWEETEST! Really helpful and just so nice, even complimented my jacket which was just so sweet. Thank you for the great service and wonderful lunch, Sushi Brokers!!"}
{"text":"The service is great and the food is excellent. If you go in for lunch on the weekends it is almost empty and quiet. The employees are extremely nice and come to refill your drink without you having to ask :) great place, would recommend!"}
{"text":"Granted it's summer time, we were seated right away. The server was pleasant. We ordered the jalapeño yellow tail sashimi dish and ahi tuna salad. Both dishes we're really good. There was some confusion as to what the market special included and the price is kind of high for a place that doesn't exactly have the namesake yet. As well, they overly advertise that proteins are \"all natural\" which really doesn't tell a good story. I'm always kind of skeptical as to what \"all natural\" actually means especially when it comes to proteins. If you were to say it's grass fed beef or wild caught fish that would paint a better picture. I would come back though which is a good thing."}
{"text":"I always enjoy my dinner there. They have a good selection on happy hour everyday from 3pm to 6:30pm. If you like garlic, get the edamame with garlic. Yum!  The Surfer roll and the Crunchy roll are excellent. Nice portions. The staff that works at the restaurant is always very friendly and provides good service."}
{"text":"Dined at this restaurant many times over the years however never experienced as poor service as we did today.  One waitress servicing about six people and she took 15 minutes to come to the table another delay in getting us a menu then she threw the attitude at us. Will likely not return it if it wasn't for the manager named Johnny who extended because apologies. Hope the service gets better or this place is in trouble."}
{"text":"It's been over a year since my last Sushi Brokers review and I've likely been in a few times since then... the food is always decent, the prices are not bad, and the atmosphere is fun, especially if you like loud music and people-watching.  However, I have to take off a star for the horrible service!  I went in for dinner tonight with two girlfriends.  We arrived right after happy hour which likely explains why the place was packed, but luckily, we did get seated in a booth inside shortly after we arrived.  The hostess was nice enough but the wait staff? Not so much!  (I had to use the expression \"not so much\" since that is Jared's latest expression of choice when he is not satisfied with something).  The wait staff was almost nonexistent... our menus were left on the table after we ordered, our dirty dishes were left on the table after we ate, we waited a very long time to get the check, and the bathrooms were pretty filthy too.  So I know I don't give 2 star reviews very often, but I can't help myself on this one.  I hope that Sushi Brokers will read this and take my feedback with a grain of salt (or in this case, with a drop of soy sauce)."}
{"text":"Went here for New Year's Eve with a couple of friends. Was really excited because they said it was really good. The food was good I will say that but the service was bad basically from the start. It was slow our alcoholic drinks ran empty and was never asked about a second we had to waive another wait staff member to get another drink. We hardly ever saw our waitress and felt ignored. On a table tab of $200 which should have been more i expect better service. Would have loved to give this more stars but couldn't justify it based on the bad service."}
{"text":"The best Sushi place in town. They are always open to custom creations. They can kick it up with as much spice as you would like! My favorite roll is the surfer..."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place more stars but the lack of respect to the fish hurt. They have a great staff and atmosphere but ordered a sashimi dish, which in most places the the fish is left alone, but this place drenched it in a ginger dressing and killed the meal. Let the fish speak for itself and you guys are going to rock it. Also, you should probably ask your guests how their meal was and not just pass the bill over and tell your clients to have a nice day."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best sushi in Arizona. Las Vegas roll, chimichanga, crunchy, and spicy tuna are the best. Also, their Kobe burger is out of this world! The iced green tea is also very refreshing. It's a bit pricey, so I would go during happy hour only. I plead you to go here and check out this place.  I live in Gilbert, but make the drive just because it is so good."}
{"text":"Great sushi place in Gilbert. We are used to going to the scottsdale location. I was worried it would not be the same. Great news, it's awesome. Happy hour from 3-6:3 is a great time. We went on a Monday at 5 and no one was there. Great service and great good. My recommendations are the chimichanga roll and the Las Vegas roll. You won't be disappointed. I wouldn't go unless you catch happy hour. It's a bit pricy. I've found the happy hour prices equate to normal prices anywhere else."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I've been here many times, at least once a week lately, and I'm never disappointed.  The sushi is always fresh, the drinks are great and the service never lacks.  If you like the more rare types of sushi and sashimi, always ask if they have it. Escolar isn't on the regular menu, but they often have it and the sashimi plate is so good.  I recommend Sushi Brokers on Indian School to everyone - it's just great!"}
{"text":"My first time there.... waited a few minutes to see if i had to check in to sit at the bar as the hostess was on the phone. I got there around 545pm. Finally got eue contact grom the lady at bar ans stated i could sit anywhere at the bar. I order the sake with karin beer. Then asked to see the happy hour menu..not to bad . I wanted a vegas rolls with jalepenos on it and eel sauce.waitress said, sure we can do that. I was like cool, so order 2 orders. Good  rolls and great, atmosphere, but was charge 50 cents for jalepenos slices. Really, i should of been told about the fee or brought my own jalepenos at 5 cents for a whole pepper and cut them myselfs. Other than that  i would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food:  I had the miso salmon and my husband chose the chicken udon wok bowl. At first we both liked our dishes. Shortly after we starting eating, both of us realized we couldn't drink water fast enough with our meals. The sauces used for our dishes were very overpowering, to the point that o couldn't finish my veggies because the sauce was too strong and made my veggies soggy. By the time I finished my meal, I was totally bloated which is always an indicator to me that the kitchen uses MSG. I was very disappointed.   Service: Our server was upbeat and friendly. She offered good recommendations and was attentive. Things went down hill when she dropped off our bill while we were still eating our meal. She never asked if we wanted desert, which we did. We ended up not ordering dessert because it seemed like she was in a rush to turn the table. Feeling rushed to finish your meal in a Friday night is not a pleasant experience. And the restaurant had no wait so I'm not sure what that was all about.   There are plenty of other restaurant options in downtown Gilbert that are far superior to this one with both quality of food and service. This place is like a high priced Kyoto Bowl (fast food) and is not even close to being authentic. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday and they screwed up the order and my mouth was on fire from some rolls that were hot that I started drinking other people's water at the table lol     Never got my water and took forever too get the bill"}
{"text":"Hands Down best sushi ever.  They have a variety of different types of rolls, the 'Damn Good' and 'Chimichanga' rolls are my favorites.  reasonably priced happy hour - I do have to say its more expensive then RA or Stingray but you can't even begin to compare the quality of the food and drinks to these two places.    Every time I visit the service is amazing and the staff is pleasant.  Place is typically busy but I have always been seated and waited on within minutes."}
{"text":"This place is great! The sushi was perfectly priced. The happy hour is great! the drinks seemed to be watered down a bit but we had GREAT service. I don't remember the girls name that we had but we told her we would stay a while because our flight was a few hours away. She had no problem with it and brought our food out at different times. I can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great service, nice seating and great Sushi. Celebrated my son's graduation from Arcadia High here and I will definitely come back again...especially for Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Went tonight.  Great food.  Great service. Pleasant environment.  Will definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"When I was setting up my new phone here last month prior to moving, the AT&T guy suggested Sushi Brokers as a great place for dinner in the area. So, now that we're finally settled, we went on Friday.  It was still relatively busy around 8-8:15p, with the bar fully packed. We were still able to get a table no problem.  We split a spicy tuna, spicy shrimp & a crunchy roll. I thought the presentation, portion & price were all on point. All very good - but so far all I can compare it to is RA & Safeway :)  It was a little on the loud side, but not so loud that I'd knock a star off.   Great service & I liked the ambiance. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have tried to post multiple times on this review but have never been able to give this place the one star it deserves. I have been here twice hoping to give them a second try. Both times the service was absolutely horrific, the sushi was mediocre at best, and the servers incessantly and with complete lack of subtlety tried to push  drinks while never refilling our water or ice tea despite multiple requests. This place sucks. Will never go again."}
{"text":"Ive been here a million times. Never seems to dissappoint! Order there ice tea or sake bombs.   Im a huge fan of their vegas rolls and yellowtail shashimi."}
{"text":"Our server was fabulous. Her name was Hunter. She was amazing at customer service and she was very attentive and caring and considerate. Extremely thorough with our needs and accommodated  beyond our expectations. I will come back only for because she was amazing for finding our tasteful preference in seafood. I have a completely new outlook for sushi brokers hunter has made it that I know that sushi brokers is a good chain, better than any Ushuaia experience in the area I have had."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Food awesome and sushi chefs and wait staff very helpful. Oh and bartenders.  I have been here 3 times and love it!!"}
{"text":"Excellent staff and amazing desserts! The sushi is pretty much as good as you can get in AZ. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great sushi place with great happy hour prices. China mist tea awesome. Waitress was great also!  Nice little out of the way place. Little noisy though."}
{"text":"You know you've been to a good place when at lunch the next day you were wishing you had a \"doggie bag\"!"}
{"text":"Looking for a good sushi happy hour? This place has some great drink specials, but the sushi is a bit pricey for what it is. It's decently enjoyable - they have some good concoctions, but there are better rolls and sashimi out in Phoenix (try Sapporo or Sakana - the latter is my pick of the litter)."}
{"text":"Went with a couple of my friends last night and the sushi was incredible, BUT our waitress McKenna was incredible. She made our experience the best it could possibly be. I am definitely doing to come back for not only the sushi but for McKenna! A+++++ :)"}
{"text":"Okay so grabbed lunch here before heading out to the movies with some girlfriends. Started with the Edamame..excellent..buttery good with just the right amount of salt. I ordered the \"Damn Good\" and it was just that DAMN GOOD! It was solid enough so it didnt fall apart once touched by chopsticks and the smokey goodness of the chipotle sauce was the perfect addition. I tried the Hawaiian my friend ordered which she really enjoyed. For me not a lot of flavor and it fell apart easily, well for me. Im not great with chopsticks and may squeeze to hard. lol But I prefer a \"kick\" to my sushi so the Hawaiian was too bland for my taste. For dessert the three of us tried the Apple Tempura. I loved the coating but the apple itself was a bit tart. I think I would have definitely preferred the banana. Regardless I would definitely recommend checking this place out, Great sushi, laid back atmosphere, great service and great prices."}
{"text":"The cowboy roll is bomb as they come! Amazing sushi here and totally workers the price! I love sitting at the sushi bar and watching the chefs make my sushi! Great service! Love!!"}
{"text":"Sushi Brokers is old faithful...  They are the first sushi spot I ever enjoyed when I first step foot in the Valley back in 2003.  Since then, they have remained a solid spot for great sushi.  Not only is Sushi Brokers a hip place to see and be seen, they have good music and a legit reverse happy hour.  Where can you get a premium glass of SILVER OAK wine by the glass?  Sushi Brokers!  The fish is fresh tasting, the drinks are good and the staff is super attentive.    Sushi Brokers is conveniently located on the NE corner of Scottsdale Road at Frank Lloyd Wright/Bell Rd.  They have plenty of parking and a nice covered indoor patio."}
{"text":"Sushi Brokers is a staple in my portfolio.  They have a great happy hour with discounts on select sushi and beverages, and it can accommodate many different sizes of groups.  This fallback place is great for unwinding with co-workers, meeting up with friends or even getting a bite to eat on a Friday night date.  The \"oh I love this song!\" music alone can help to perk me up and start out a night the right way!  The sushi is very good -- may not be the best I have ever had but it definitely hits the spot and the fun, lowkey-but-energetic atmosphere is what keeps me coming back over and over.  One caution, the martinis tend to be a bit heavy on the juice and light on the vodka, so go with beer/wine if you're like me and can't handle the fruity drinks."}
{"text":"Oh man, where to start...  Love the creative name, and service was friendly...that's about where the love ends.  Onto da foodz -   Some quick background, I recently moved back from the Bay Area so any time I venture to a sushi restaurant in Phoenix (which I endearingly refer to as 'Desert Sushi'), I approach with caution.  We ordered four rolls, and all four of them had imitation krab in them. ALL FOUR. It was like I was eating the same roll over and over. We had held on to one of the menus in case we wanted to order more, so I inspected it quickly and took my tiny pencil and marked all their rolls with imitation krab listed in the name. It was at least 50%. In fact, one of the rolls that we ordered didn't have fake-crab-mixed-with-mayonnaise in the ingredients but it was still in our roll!   We ordered a couple more and I confirmed with the waitress that these rolls did indeed NOT have krab mix. These were much better. All in all everything tasted 'fresh' just very bland.  The cocktails were very sweet but not awful.   Even though I think they deserve two stars, I am giving them three because I don't want to hurt local businesses, and also, many people who go here just wouldn't know better. Can't miss something you've never tried!"}
{"text":"Sushi brokers SUCKS!  Low quality sushi!  If you think this place has good sushi, you don't know good sushi!  TOYAMA SUSHI RULES ALL!"}
{"text":"Good but a little pricy for the rolls. The special rolls are good but they are $14-$16 so happy hour is a good time to go. There happy hour is 4-6:30 mon -fri. The $14 rolls are $9. I had the DAMN GOOD roll and it was good.  This roll has shrimp tempura, cream cheese, and avacado topped with chipolte sauce. Its so good but I feel its small in size, a little bit bigger around then a quarter. The asparagus ol is good to Iadded cream cheese. Also we tried the lunch special with soup, salad, veggies, rice, and your choice of a few different chicken choices, We went with the Valcano Chicken. Its was good with a nice spicy kick but not to hot you had to drink after every bite. This lunch special for $9 is a good deal and its a good size portion. I was suprised at how much chicken there was. And they also have a few sushi roll lunch specials to. Ill be back but for happy hour cause some of those roll are not cheap. The inside is comfortable and the service for us was good and they were fast at getting our drinks and getting the food out."}
{"text":"Long time customers, came for my birthday and the service was utterly disappointing, ruining my evening. Our waitress, Erin showed us the owners table was more important than the other customers."}
{"text":"Very nice, helpful staff. The sushi, though, was limited in scope and less than great. I have never been to a sushi bar that didn't have saba. The bartender said that the closest thing was the red fish, which would indicate that the bartender has never tasted saba."}
{"text":"Only thing I have to say positive was the inside was nice. Other than that I was pretty disappointed. They were out of rangoons, the calamari was like rubber so we didn't even eat that and the sushi we had was bland except there was enough to spice on it to mask that. Sadly will not return."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite sushi spot for years and I hate to give this rating but they are not child friendly.  We found out when meeting up with friends and were told they do not provide high chairs as the owners prefer no children there.  I literally brought in my car seat and used it to prop my child up.  So sad to hear the owners don't encourage families with young children at their establishment it just makes it harder.  I have dropped so much money there over the years and they have lost by business after the waitress quietly explained to our table the owners view.  I hope they change this one day and start to provide boosters and high chairs."}
{"text":"This place was suggested to us by a friend. We love sushi and we are very skeptical of going to new places. But hands down this is one of the best sushi places in AZ, both with the food and ambience and most definitely the service. I will definitely come here again and will suggest it to all our friends."}
{"text":"I really liked the open space for the restaurant the the amount of outdoor seating as well. The server was very attentive and had good recommendations for us. Being a party of 10, it did take some time to get our food out but we all received it within 3-5 minutes and we're happily digging in to the delicious food.   I ordered the half Sushi Pizza for $17. The whole pizza was $25 and that was by far a better deal when you think about the amount of sashimi and seafood that was on the pizza. I still enjoyed my half pizza because i was unable to get through half of the plate and took the leftovers for dinner. The rice base was nice and crispy and I am a cheese lover so the amount of cheese they added was perfect. Im happy we were able to visit the location after making last minute lunch plans.   If I'm ever visiting the Gilbert's area, I'll definitely check out Sushi Brokers again!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Rolls came out in a timely. Only drawback is sitting on bar stools at most of the tables.  Prefer chair height for getting in and out of seat"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good but nothing sticks out.  The music can be a little too loud at times.  I go to eat, not party but in either case, the sushi is good.  No big complaints"}
{"text":"Attitude is an understatement. Sat at the bar for at least 10 minutes before somehow decided to ask if I needed anything - and the place was half empty. Everyone seemed more preoccupied in taking care of a specific table, maybe the owners? Proceeded to ask if they had chirashi was part of the menu and from the look of the chef it seemed like I asked  him for a burger. Bottom line, bad vibe and service equals no returns."}
{"text":"Not worth a re-visit.  If you're going to charge $13.50 for 5 pieces of sashimi, I'd like to be a hell of lot more tender and THICK..not the paper thin slices I was served."}
{"text":"We go here often and are always happy.  The sushi is fresh and we'll seasoned so you don't always need sauce.  I love the tempura - both the shrimp and veggie plates.  The wait staff and the guys behind the sushi bar are always attentive and quick.  A shout out to Kohl, our waiter on our last visit.  He was super helpful and funny!"}
{"text":"This is my second time a sushi Brokers and the place sucks. The waitress is not very good. She had her hand all over the top of my sake bottle when she brought it to me. Then she forgot some orders. The chefs are all slow and they were talking and laughing. Like it's flu season keep your mouth shut and not laughing over the food. food was also brought out item by item. I waited for 10 mins for my food to come. Then on top of that my eel was cold. Not cool. I'm never going to this place again. Just pass this place."}
{"text":"Way overpriced, we ordered the calamari and it was like chewing on a rubber band.  Then, we ordered a Las Vegas roll...wow, just wow. We had to send it back because I am convinced the salmon was rotten.  I rarely ever send anything back, especially sushi but I had to. After the calamari, we only ate because we were starving, and the terrible roll which they were kind enough to remove from the bill, we left. We spent $40 on two beers, saki and a plate of rubber bands. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Sushi Brokers has a cool atmosphere and friendly staff. The sushi quality is pretty good but they never seem to make the miso soup right, always way too salty."}
{"text":"We were staying across the street and wanted some Sushi. Naturally I was hesitant to have sushi in a non-costal region - ignorance? Maybe.   Our plates were dirty. It was quickly remedied by the waitress but still - gross. The fish was was not fresh. Although they did have uni, my favorite, it tasted gross.   The sushi was EXTREMELY expensive- most likely to pay for shipping costs - but as stated in the beginning, sushi in the desert? I should've known better."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first visit. The atmosphere was very nice. We were greeted with smiles and ultimately  greeted by the manager Johnny. A very friendly & professional person. The service was outstanding and the food was amazing. Probably  the best sushi we have had since we moved here from California. My new favorite  sushi bar in AZ. Ask for Keith, great young sushi chef"}
{"text":"Great place for Happy Hour. They have a lot of their famous rolls on happy hour. The music and environment is great as well. The customer service was awesome... From the hostesses to the wait staff. Very impressive! I will be back!"}
{"text":"There was a rumor that a new Sushi restaurant was going to open in Old Town Gilbert and \"its going to be really good!\". Went here a couple of times before posting this review. My last visit pretty much sealed the deal.  Negatives  Every time my wife and I eaten here, our drinks (soda) didn't taste good. Carbonation was always off. You tasted more of the carbonated water rather than the requested flavor. We just ended up ordering water.   One thing I hate about having a waiter or waitress is relying on them to refill my soda (my personal opinion). I drink a lot of liquid and thanks to the Army, I eat too fast. I will not eat unless I have a drink near me. Every time we dined in; we only had got one refill for our drinks during our 30-45 minute visits. My wife ended up sharing her drink with me because she fears I'll choke on how fast I eat. We're very considerate if it's busy and we understand but after 10-12 minutes... These have been the same results in all our visits which will drive us away.  The last time I was here, I came in by myself and sat at the bar. The restaurant itself was pretty empty during this time. Nobody came up to me for an awkward 5-6 minutes. I looked around and I saw employees standing around, talking and laughing with each other. One of the chefs (sushi maker) saw me waiting and he took the liberty to ask me what I would like to drink and handed me the sushi menu.  One thing I noticed is uniform. I guess yoga pants and workout clothes is the standard. It was hard to distinguish who was an employee. I can't take someone serious who looks like they just got out of the gym or looks like they just rolled out of bed.  Positives  A lot of sushi to select. Tasty and plates are clean in presentation. Overall the food is great!  Clean restaurant and attracts quality customers. Lively on Friday and Saturday nights. There is televisions all around the restaurant to watch ESPN and other sporting events.   Improvements  - Customer Service - Fix the setting for the carbonation in beverages (soda) - Consider changing uniform standard"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi and a fun time also. Great service and always a fun place to go for sushi. Staff is great and so is the food."}
{"text":"I had the chance to head out to Sushi Brokers for lunch with some friends and it did not disappoint from all the reviews I've heard.  The Philly Roll and some Edamame were the perfect lunch combo, and the Crunchy Roll my friend let me try was delish also!  The service was quick and we were back on time to work despite the hand made rolls, which is just an added bonus.   Overall: A Great rolls and friendly service - definitely a lunch time return place."}
{"text":"Updating my previous review. This was my 5th or 6th visit to Sushi Brokers at 44th and Indian School. It's obviously under new management because I never had any problems on my previous visits.  I'll start by saying that after what just happened to me and a friend of mine, I will never ever ever be back. I sure hope everybody reading this does not go there either.   I just ordered a rainbow roll and edamame while waiting for my friend to arrive. The waiter told me that even though the rainbow roll is not on the happy hour menu it will ring up in the computer as a happy hour roll. So I asked him how much it costs at happy hour prices. He told me $14. I looked on the menu and it costs $14.50. Those are NOT happy hour prices! He lied.  My roll arrived and for that price I was expecting a pretty roll with sauce on top and a nice array. The manager, Devin, stopped by and asked, \"How's everything?\" I said, \"expensive. $15 for a  four(8) piece roll is expensive.\" He said, \"It's the quality of our sushi that you won't find anywhere else in the valley.\" I've eaten sushi all over the Valley. It wasn't like this was my first rainbow roll. Duh! I told the manager that Moto Sushi serves the rainbow roll on a pretty plate and has it arched and colorful like a rainbow with sauce dripped on top for under $11. And Mido Sushi has all you can eat sushi with sashimi, free soup, salad, edamame and ice cream for $20!!  He said,\"Well this is Sushi Brokers!\" and walked away with a snotty look on his punk face. Poor baby couldn't take the competition?!  My rainbow roll had four (8 tiny) pieces thrown on a plate...no sauce, presentation or anything. I took a picture and will post it for your viewing pleasure. (Take a look zzzzz).   By the time my friend arrived, I had already eaten my tiny roll, but was planning to order another off the happy hour menu. I showed her a picture of my rainbow roll and told her the price. She was shocked! While we were talking, the manager came over, could clearly see that we were talking, and asked her if she was ready to order. She said she wasn't ready and we continued to talk. A few minutes later, the manager came back and told us that we needed to be on our way. I said, \"Be on our way? You are kicking us out?\" He said, \"Yes. You don't come into an establishment and complain about the prices when they are clearly marked on the menu.\" Say what??!! Since when are clientele are not allowed to discuss prices?!! My friend said,\"You mean I can't order?\" He said no, handed me the bill and told us to hurry.  I got great satisfaction in writing \"Eat Shit!\" in big letters on my bill and did not leave a tip. I tossed the bill on the counter and walked out.  $19 for a bowl of edamame and a very small rainbow roll that was by far NOT the best sushi in the Valley! As if!! We both left hungry and I felt as though I hadn't eaten anything.   I will NEVER step foot in this place again and do not recommend that you do either."}
{"text":"Very good food and service for a new restaurant.  Nice place with casual atmosphere. We had sashimi and it was fresh. Also had a signature roll (surfer) it was unique and delicious"}
{"text":"Came in with my family and had the best service from the first step through the door. The food, atmosphere, and the employers were FANTASTIC! Our server Eric came over to help us and he was EXCEPTIONAL! Definitely would recommend this establishment to everyone!A+++++"}
{"text":"SCOTTSDALE, AZ: (how to have a 5-star experience at this 3.5-star restaurant).  I love Sushi Brokers.  I get the same thing every time and am always delighted:   ***!!!*** The Surfer Roll  ***!!!***  The menu might as well have exactly one item on it.  (Maybe two, if you add the tempura combo, which is also good.)  The surfer roll is a tasty tuna and avocado sushi roll topped with a dynamite hot and spicy mayo basted array of shrimp tails and crab!  It is absolutely delicious and the most guilty-pleasure sushi I have anywhere in the country.  I look forward to it every time I am in Phoenix.  You must try it before judging this restaurant.  The rest of the menu may be lackluster, but I wouldn't know it.  Just order this and you will be a happy sumo."}
{"text":"PHOENIX, AZ: Is sushi brokers the best sushi in Phoenix?  Probably not.  Is it my favorite sushi in Phoenix?  Oh yeah!  There is a ton of flavor, groovy music, nice decor and friendly service.  It's a great place for a business meeting or to hang out for happy hour.  Order the surfer roll; probably my most favorite guilty pleasure sushi ever.  The lollipop roll is also a clever take with a cucumber exterior and the rolls are on skewers."}
{"text":"Oh, you little broker of sushi you. how fun you are. whats that? you dont like sushi? well. dont fret. they also have sliders. yeah. like chicken. and beef. and probably a spicy tuna slider also. but only if you ask nicely.   i've only ever been for happy hour, and it hit the spot! we tried about 5-6 different menu items, all at least 50% off ($20 roll for $10? yup. 2 please). drinks are strong; who doesnt love that? probably the same person that doesnt like my reveiws because my witty banter is lame. ha!   seriously though, its awesome. try it. you'll love it. trust me cause im trustworthy."}
{"text":"I've bee here a few times and gotta give the Volcano Chicken a rave review. LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!   Sushi is fresh, drinks are generous. The only reason I don't give it five stars is inconsistent service. I can sit at the bar and wait 10 minutes for even a hello. And sometimes I can go in, sit at the bar and have someone within 10 seconds. Table service is spotty also when it comes to drink service and clearing plates.   But all in all, enjoyable and good food. And VOLCANO CHICKEN!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it first opened, (the lollipop and surfer rolls are Sensational!) over the last two years it seems to get better and better overall. I get the same great service every time, Misty always welcomes each customer with a warm greeting and immediate service. She always takes care of us and let's us know about all the new specials. I love this place!"}
{"text":"They make a great sashimi salad! I love sushi brokers staff, always friendly and great service. Convenient location by my work!"}
{"text":"Service is always great lunch or dinner and I've yet to have a bad piece of sushi. My favorite is the \"sushi pizza\" it is soooooo yummy. I just wish it would be on the happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Good Sushi in a bar atmosphere. Seemed like a great place to hang out, but it's pretty small. Sushi in AZ? Yeah, and they do a good job, too! check it swim..."}
{"text":"Very good happy hour. Surfer roll is unique and delicious!!! It's also hearty. Great staff"}
{"text":"The ambiance is quite nice, though the music was a bit loud like a dance club. The service was very good. Regarding the food, I think the sushi and sashimi we ordered (several varieties of plates) was mediocre though. The sushi rice was fresh but, the ingredients were not really spectacular to me or my wife. No zest or real unique flavor. It was kind of, well, bland and boring. Compared to many other sushi restaurants we've dined at from Hawaii, California, to Arizona or, even east of the Mississippi River, this place was just, eh, so-so. It was kind of disappointing, unfortunately. That's my take."}
{"text":"Always fresh sushi. Rainbow roll was my favorite. Not a big fan of the Alaskan roll.  Lollipop was good; spicy.  Ask for \"Mcanna\" for a server. She was amazing."}
{"text":"This place is part sushi bar, part disco and part sports bar. I have gone to Sushi Brokers at least six times in the last year, mainly because its close to my house but also because they have consistently fresh sushi.    The FOOD: I always get the salmon (sake) and then play around with the rest of the menu.  The very best thing I have found is the miso salad.  It is one of the most yummy salads I've had and I will continue to order it each and every time I go to Sushi Brokers. It has fresh, dark green, leafy things with crispy wonton things and a gorgeous dressing.  I tried the outlaw roll this last time which was spicy tuna, shrimp tempura and avocado all rolled up in rice paper.  AMAZING ROLL!!!  The Ambiance: The music is loud, usually R and B, pop, top 40 etc.  This is where my boyfriend and I became addicted to the song OMG by Usher.  So, don't expect a quiet night. They have plenty of flat screens showing the game.  You can virtually see one from any angle, which is good - especially when its game five of Lakers vs. Suns.    The Service:  The service is sometimes so bad that its funny.  The hostess is always there to greet you and even open the door for you (this is the good part and it just goes downhill from there).  The wait staff is a group of disconnected, distracted, casual ladies who scamper haphazardly between tables taking orders.  They have only minimal knowledge of the menu (food and drink) and become hard to find once they drop off the food.  It was hard to get a second round of drinks as I couldn't see where my waitress disappeared to. Its really more comical than anything - kind of like the *show* that goes with dinner.    I will continue to patronize Sushi Brokers but they better watch out because Stingray Sushi is opening at the Scottsdale Quarter in October, which is even closer to my house."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious but it is very unfortunate that they don't provide high chairs.. We always want to go for happy hour but remember we can't.."}
{"text":"Full disclosure ... our visit was about a month ago.  My husband and I decided to stop in for lunch one day.  It was our first visit and will be our last.  Service was slow, although friendly.  It was tolerable.  What was unacceptable is that we both order a lunch special which came with miso soup.  The soup was served to us barely look warm!  We told the server this and she took them back.  She said someone in the kitchen had shut off the burner to the soup because it was in between lunch and dinner??? So the waitress brought new bowls.  My husbands was hot and mine was still cold! Told the waitress. She just laughed and said she was \"going to kill them\" .  No offer to bring another or take something off the bill .... nothing.  The worst part about this though, brings up a question of food safety in the kitchen.  Isn't food that is sitting out supposed to be kept at a specific temperature or be refrigerated!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to open for months! Finally a sushi joint in the Arcadia area with happy hour 7 days a week :) I had the opportunity to check the place out tonight and was extremely satisfied with my overall experience. Though the place was almost completely packed we found 2 available seats at the sushi bar when we walked in. We were quickly greeted and taken care of by multiple bartenders.  Their calamari was delicious! Along with all of their freshly made sushi. However, the best asset of Sushi Brokers was their customer service. They couldn't do enough for us. All of the staff was attentive and efficient. We were in and out within an hour which is impressive for how busy they were on a Friday night. I will definitely be back often!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good but the music was terrible and LOUD! Not everybody enjoys listening to rap and techno music, but it was so loud I had to yell at my wife from Across the table! We eventually asked for it to be turned down since we were the only ones there at 3:30pm Monday. After the place started filling up though, I could hear it slowly being cranked up again. It's not a good (atmospherically speaking) relaxing place to enjoy after a hard days work."}
{"text":"This place is in an awesome spot in downtown Gilbert. The atmosphere inside is nice and the patio looks like it would be fun when it cools down since it actually has booth seating. Overall our experience was just meh. Our waitress was nice, but not very speedy and it was very slow. The calamari was really tough and chewy, so I wouldn't order that again. The sushi was good. Not the best I've ever had or anything to rave about, but it was good. Overall, we didn't have a bad experience, just wasn't anything crazy awesome.  However, I will say that it was super slow and they had not one but 2 hostesses. I don't care, I'm not the one paying them. But there were multiple people leaving the restaurant after their meals that were not given a proper, \"thank you for coming in\" or any sort of acknowledgement because the two said hostesses were chatting and eating food from under their host stand. I only noticed this because we were seated right in front of them. Doesn't really effect my review, but I find it a little mind blowing that it didn't cross either of their minds as restaurant goers watched them chow down at work.    We probably will not come again, just because I feel like there are better options all over town."}
{"text":"I had my doubts. I mean...I live in San Francisco home of THE best sushi. The sushi is great. The rolls are creative and the bartender as well as the sushi chefs really take care of the customers very well. I had a great time here with other business travelers watching the basketball game. We all agreed that the ambiance and the food is very palate-able here. I will definitely come back when I am in Scottsdale. Fun atmosphere and great times are found here."}
{"text":"Over priced and under delivered.  The salmon was slimy and a bit too soft.  The food tasted bland as if its shelf life was within sight.  Overall I paid too much to wait as long as we did for the food to come out.  Won't go there again.  Sushi station on Tatum is much cheaper and has simple yet straightforward food which is as of equal or better quality as what I tasted there."}
{"text":"We seem to eat a lot of sushi, and came to try this place.    Loved the location and the atmosphere.    The place itself is spot-on immaculate.   The sushi itself, was just....OK.   We bought a lot of rolls and none of them really blew my mind.   Basic is a good word.   Not bad, not great.   I spent the same as most other sushi restaurants, but I just didn't love the food.     The spider roll was a bit weird.  I think they were going for different, and I didn't really want different on that kinda roll.   The diamondback roll was killer though.    The rolls fell apart pretty easily and they lacked some of the basics that most Sushi restaurants have like green tea, etc.      Service was good....  Pretty average Sushi."}
{"text":"Think of a stereotypical restaurant in Scottsdale.  Sushi Brokers is that place.  Slightly unattractive waitresses flaunting their fake tits.  A superficial crowd, filled with oogling men and scary-skinny women with fake blonde hair.      We walked in to Sushi Brokers, wanting a nice, quiet and satisfying dining experience.  I felt like I wasted an hour of my life after eating here.   You know the music is too loud when you feel the sub thumping throughout your body.  I usually don't mind louder music, but this was ridiculous.  This is no club.  It's a restaurant.  I almost asked, like a 75-year-old, for them to turn it the fuck down.  Our waitress was clearly not interested in us, and was visibly disappointed when we didn't order alcohol.  Thanks, hun.  Maybe the meal would redeem the place...but what ensued quickly shattered all hope of redemption.  NOTHING CAME OUT IN A TIMELY MANNER.  The food was SLOPPY, BLAND and STOMACH-TURNING.    Miso salad was meh--nothing memorable.  We requested steamed veggies and brown rice.  They do not serve brown rice, so don't even ask.  The veggies were overdone--no crispness whatsoever.  Onions were used as a filler between the three pieces of broccoli, mealy squash and overdone carrots.   The sushi.  As I write this i can already feel my unpleasant morning creeping up on me.  The tuna and yellowtail were warm and not the least bit fresh.  The veggie roll was bland, with a hint of something bitter.  Ew.  Then we waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Didn't we order another roll?  \"They have to cook the eel so it takes a while\".  I've had Unagi before and it takes TWO MINUTES to cook.    After waiting 25 minutes we received our caterpillar roll and unagi.  The unagi was cold.  The roll was saturated in a gross version of eel sauce.  It was like honey.  The eel was gummy.  Avocado was not fresh, but somehow it was still green.    I made the unfortunate decision of using the restroom.  Absolutely disgusting, FILTHY.  And the music bumps up 10 decibels.  There is something so disturbingly artificial about every aspect of this place.  I will never return, even if they paid me.  A waste of calories and a HUGE waste of money."}
{"text":"Johnny and Cole have the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE!! They will be the only reason i ever go to sushi brokers! It's all about customer service! Food and service was amazing thanks to them!"}
{"text":"Came here on a bustling Saturday night and we were seated fairly quickly. When its at capacity, it can get quite loud, making conversation difficult. Enjoyed quite a bit of sake(almost too much) and ordered sushi. Flavors were good and seafood seemed fresh. If the service was more personable, as I have come to expect when eating Sushi and other meals at this price point, I would rate higher. Service wasn't terrible but there wasn't anything that had me wanting to come back for more."}
{"text":"Could I get a 3 1/2 possibly?  Service is always very hospitable.  Sushi in the summer can taste a bit on the mushy side.  Also the green tea makes the arnold palmers not so great...  Volcano Chicken and Vegetable Tempura are sure bets everytime.  Great place to go for happy hour if you are going to keep it simple.  We come here all the time and it is very serviceable.  Did I mention I love the Volcano Chicken??"}
{"text":"Sashimi was great as was seaweed salad, perfection, and the rainbow roll exquisite!!! Service was fast and waiter was friendly! Not too noisy. Fun! Fun! Fun!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I would eat here every day if I could. Great happy hour. Never disappointed with their spicy tuna, cowboy or chimi rolls. Spicy tuna rolls are actually SPICY and delicious! What a concept!! The only reason I didn't give them a 5 is because the service is almost always slow. I love this place so much that waiting a little longer doesn't deter me."}
{"text":"I recently took my daughter out for a Daddy/Daughter date and the food was good but the service lacked their usual class.  However, this is the second time in a few months I have been there and had the same problem."}
{"text":"Wow, there is not a lot of love for this place. I suppose that is fitting.   I have only been here for reverse happy hour. This is primarily because it is too freaking expensive for what you get. Sapporo right down the street has much better sushi at the same price.   There are good things. The reverse happy hour makes it affordable, for us whose pockets aren't loaded with coin. The sushi is decent.   One of the big faux pas of this place, I think,  is the atmosphere. Plastering the walls with huge flat panels that are flickering the latest sports event, seems to scream chicken wings and beer to me, not sushi and sake. Overall, this is not a coveted destination, but works if you are dying for mediocre sushi at Robin Leach prices. Wow."}
{"text":"Sushi Brokers is the Ra of sushi bars.  (See what I did there?)  I have been only once and was so disappointed I couldn't drag myself back.  It's one of those sushi bars that make up for a lack of quality product by masking everything with cheesy names on a menu filled with \"creative\" rolls.  Calling these concoctions sushi is like calling the new Burger King Ribs BBQ.  It's always packed when I pass it.  Which makes me like it even less.  This is not a place for sushi lovers but a place to appear to be a sushi lover."}
{"text":"With limited Sunday sushi options in the Arcadia area, my friends and I went to Sushi Brokers for happy hour. The prices were reasonable for sure. And the service was slow but nice. The sushi was unimpressive but tasted fresh. I probably would not return again, but if it's Sunday and your area is limited, it's a decent choice!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place but were very disappointed to arrive tonight (our 10th plus time) only this time with our toddler. It was then we found out just how UNFRIENDLY Sushi Brokers is to families! No high chair or booster whatsoever in the entire place! What a complete joke. Get with the program so we can get our sushi fix!"}
{"text":"Place is awesome , our order took a little longer than excepted but the waitress was really super awesome and made up for the wait. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a place to eat sushi and have a great time"}
{"text":"Like the rolls, but finding a different sushi spot because this location is not family friendly. They have no highchairs or booster seats - which I totally understand if it were all bar seating, but surprising for an establishment with table seating that advertises itself as family friendly. Hostess was not apologetic about it at all, either, and seemed quite put out that I even asked."}
{"text":"The roll was ok, tasted good but small.  The Veggie tempura was great it was a big portion.  Service was too slow and we waited for our food when the place wasn't that busy.  Ambiance good but definitely would eat inside since the outside patio is next to a parking garage.  Overall an ok experience but we've had better at a mom and pop sushi restaurant where we paid less."}
{"text":"Finally got over to SB in Gilbert after having been to the Scottsdale location numerous times. The decor is dead on same as the Scottsdale location but this one has an outdoor/ indoor dining option.  The service was on point and the sushi was as memorable as their other location. The garlic/ chili sauce edamame was crazy good!"}
{"text":"This place has great parking, fun atmosphere and great food...what else could you want in Scottsdale?"}
{"text":"It was my last night in Phoenix and I was looking for a sushi place not too far from the airport and this was the best choice. The 3.5 star rating on Yelp had me a bit unsure about this place but I was craving sushi so bad that I decided to go for it. I made it there right at the end of happy hour (not just for drinks, but for sushi as well). My waitress was super nice and said she would charge my dinner at happy hour price even though it was technically passed the time. The sushi was good. The service was great. The place was nice. I would go back."}
{"text":"Review strictly on food (because service is just meh): Still one of my fav sushi spots in town! Always go for the Cowboy or Cowgirl roll and you won't be disappointed. The Sanchez is good, too.   ***Side Note: After posting this review, I noticed other patrons' input. I read a lot of disturbing things about the new management. No kids allowed? New-ish policy? I was just there and saw NO signage of this. Strange. I don't have kids myself but I think that after being up and running successfully for so long and establishing regulars (some of which are parents) they made a bad decision and ticked off a lot of locals. Nothing kills businesses more than the power of word of mouth, I've seen it too many times. What a bummer. ***"}
{"text":"My waitress is the bomb! Madelyn is the best! She has exceeded all expectations, she's beyond nice. Very awesome! The food here is also amazing! I ordered something I get At most sushi places and it wasn't on the menu. She knew what I was talking about and when it came out I was so happy. It was delicious. Then because I love sushi so much I asked her which was her favorite and she recommended this yellowtail and jalapenos with avocado, hot Damn! Shit was . She was really something special. Wish I had her at every restaurant I went to!"}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi spot! If your in The neighborhood this place is worth checking out. I usually order their edamame, 2 Las Vegas rolls and a crunchy roll. I love their eel sauce and always order extra on the side for dipping. The only downside for me is their iced green tea. It's a little watered down sometimes and other times it's spot on, I wish it was more consistent. But it's not a big deal since their sushi makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for first time with my wife and it was really good sushi.  We had the cowgirl, damn good and lolly pop roll.  We really like the cowgirl and the damn good roll the lolly pop was ok.  Had a great server named David that suggested the sushi.  Glad to find a great sushi place right down the road!!"}
{"text":"Sushi brokers has some seriously good rolls. Service here needs to improve,  but the food is excellent. Make sure to try the damn good roll! Happy hour specials are excellent, and it is almost never busy during happy hour."}
{"text":"Sushi was average. Service is below par and rude. Even though the place was nearly empty, we found ourselves waiting and waiting. The manager, Jessica, is bad for business. Seeing us alone for so long she did a quick drive by with zero customer relationship skills, didn't offer us any reason to ever come back. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Sunshine roll is a small piece of heaven and the green tea ice cream was a hit with the little ones."}
{"text":"This is by far my most favorite sushi spot of all! I've tried plenty, but this place keeps me coming back. They always have great music playing and the waiting staff is great and always so pleasant. I would definately suggest their Tootsie Roll and Las Vegas roll. They blow the doors off any other places I've yet to try. Try to make it in for their happy hour or their reverse happy hour. Your wallet will thank you for it!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine brought me here since we both work in the area and I wanted sushi, I've heard this place is DELICIOUS so I was excited to try it. We ordered 3 rolls (Cowgirl, Las Vegas, Spicy Tuna). I know the Lv and the ST are pretty standard so you really can't mess those up but I chose the cowgirl and had them omit the scallions...so it was Spicy Yellowtail(my fav), topped with sliced yellowtail, spicy mayo and sriracha. SO glad I chose that roll because it was scrumptious!! My friend had never eaten yellowtail before so he was glad to try it and really liked it as well. I will def be going back to this place and can't wait to try more specialty rolls"}
{"text":"Service was a little slow, and the music was a little loud, however the sushi was amazing. We had several rolls, all of which were fantastic. The Cowgirl roll was out of this world. I would put up with the slow service any day to revisit the heavenly-ness of the sushi! mmmm So good!"}
{"text":"For being in a landlocked state I thought this sushi place was great.  It's not on the same level as SF but all the fish was prepared well and had a good texture.  They have \"reverse happy hour\" which starts at 10 and it is a fantastic deal, almost half off a lot of the nigiri which they also let you order without rice so it's like getting sashimi for $1 a piece which is a great deal.  I'm not a big roll guy, but we tried a few rolls and they were all pretty good, big beers were $4 during happy hour so a huge meal for two with drinks was only $70 total which is great considering a similar meal in SF would put you over $100 without a problem."}
{"text":"Id heard that this location had opened, but that it was a nightmare to try and get into.  Luckily, I went w/ a Dishcrawl group on a night when it seemed to not be busy at all.  I was surprised that the decor was so generic. Ive been hearing about the one up in North Scottsdale and I just pictured it as being nicer. No matter. We grabbed a large booth and started to explore the menu.  We ended up getting  Cali rolls, yellowtail rolls, Tootsie rolls (always my fave), and some sashimi. All of there sushi was wicked fresh. It really was delicious. I also tried one of their pomegranate cosmos. It was a bitttt to tart for my taste though. I wouldnt order it again.  Overall we had a good meal here, though short. The staff was very nice and quick.  Id definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"I am very upset by this restaurant, too expensive, low quality sushi, poor service, long waiting for the dishes. I'm sure there I was with my family for the first and last time. I do not advise spending money in this restaurant."}

{"text":"Best sushi we've ever had. We ordered a ton of food all was out of this world. Jamie was our server and she was fantastic. She helped make it a really fun night. It was a very busy and loud and vibrant atmosphere. Had a wonderful experience and we cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is the best happy hour in town. They have awesome sushi and an even better drink selection. Sushi brokers has very good wine at an almost store price which is unheard of for a restaurant. It is small so you will want to get there early!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner recently. The food is very good. Nice environment and the chef are very friendly and helpful. Don't eat sushi often so they helped me order and made great choices. The hot lips roll is amazing but very spicy. The cowboy roll is awesome and so if the shrimp dynamite. Reasonable prices. Chef also let us try some of their new creations for free."}
{"text":"So I've been coming to sushi brokers for 5+ years and I have to be honest it's not for the service, more like I put up with the service because the sushi is so \"damn good\"  but on my last visit my fiancé and I had Savannah as our server and we were both shocked at how AMAZING the service was, hands down the best server we've ever had at sushi brokers BY FAR! Thanks Savannah!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi place in Scottsdale. I love the volcano chicken and the chimichanga roll. The reverse happy hour is great too."}
{"text":"They have a great reverse happy hour,  10-close every night. Veggie tempura is so yummy and only $4 and the sushi is pretty good.  My favorite is the green tea ice cream!  It is hard to find a place with great green tea ice cream and sushi brokers has it.    The cons about this place is the horrible music. They set their music pretty loud too which just makes it worse. Also the service here is extremely slow.  Every time I have been there for hh there has only been one server.  It gets pretty busy at this time so I don't understand why they don't get another server.  I get you want tips but the restaurant shouldn't sacrifice the speed of service in order to do that."}
{"text":"Overpriced average food. The only reason they get two stars is the lunch special is reasonable when you order their specialty rolls. The one with shrimp dynamite dumped on it is very tasty."}
{"text":"Everything we had was awesome, very fresh and tasty.  It is a bit on the high end where pricing is concerned but I was not disappointed. Our friends introduced us to the place and we had a great time with Sake Bombers, as you can imagine."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in to have dinner. I was apprehensive but open minded. Then actual service here was below sub-par. Our food came out item by item and not all at once as ordered. I not sure if they are under staffed but we had to constantly remind our waitress what items were missing and the alcoholic beverage that was never delivered until again we reminded our waitress. As for the food I would give it a C- and that is  being generous. I would not return nor suggest for any one to come."}
{"text":"Love sushi, love this place, and especially love happy hour! I prefer to sit at the bar when coming here because the service is better and the bartenders and very attentive. The garlic edamame is quite possibly my favorite food in the entire world. My sister and I will easily drive the 30 minutes across town for multiple bowls of this. The fish is fresh and the rolls are delicious! The many times I have come here, I have never been unhappy with the food or service."}
{"text":"My favorite reasonably priced sushi restaurant in Scottsdale! Can't beat their happy hour sushi selection and always tastes fresh! (Highly recommend the cowgirl roll) I took off a star for inconsistent service. The wait staff is either on you like white on rice or they'll completely ghost you after you've been served."}
{"text":"Love it!  So happy to have a decent sushi place in the neighborhood again.  Their rolls are inventive and delicious, music not too loud, atmosphere friendly.  Great happy hour!"}
{"text":"Good service, great rolls and good atmosphere for a sushi restaurant in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"If I have a choice of sushi places in Scottsdale, Sushi Brokers is always my first choice. It is much more fresh than Ra!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Fish tasted fresh. Some of the roles are a bit pricey and the lunch specials don't offer much as far as Sushi goes. Overall solid choice but there are better options in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and I have to say I have never had a bad meal here. They have a great happy hour. The volcano chicken is great and a little secret is the ask to mix the chicken with teriyaki. it comes in sirhacha. Its great.  Its not too loud, the price point is right, and the best part for me is there is cooked food as well as sushi. I initially didn't want to eat here because I don't eat Sushi. I came for my friends. The cooked menu is great. Anyway, hope this was helpful."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed eating here and you guys make some delicious food. However, one complaint I do have is your lack of highchairs. It was fine when my daughter was smaller and she could stay in her car seat but now she's very mobile and I have no desire to hold her in my lap and attempt to eat while she grabs for everything within her reach. Please invest in some highchairs. It would be much appreciated by this and I'm sure other loyal customers."}
{"text":"I enjoyed it, although a tad expensive for what it's worth. Very scottsdale swanky.  I got the bento box lunch special, which is a pretty neat japanese idea. They normally do it with children's lunches, but they expanded it out to adult portions at this restaraunt. You get a specialty roll, rice, miso soup, salad, ginger, wasabi, and a little pile of cabbage. Pretty tasty, but $15 for one roll and a few small sides was a little pricey for me. It took a little longer than I had hoped to get service, but their iced green tea was good.  Would definitely go back, but only if I made the wrong turn accidentally and missed Teharu, the revolving sushi place a mile away."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here Wednesday and we loved it; our server Kailee went above and beyond to make sure we had a great dining experience. The sushi is excellent, hands down best I've had in AZ."}
{"text":"PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE! my boyfriend and I experienced the worse service last night. I explained to the server how I am severely allergic to Sriracha and how it cannot be within any of our sushi rolls. She was extremely kind and went to the chef to explain my request. She returned to our table and explained the chefs frustrations and did not want to make our special orders (we only ask to not include anything that contained sriracha) and need to choose something else from the menu. Then we suggested to the server to allow the chef to be creative and make up anything he thinks we'll enjoy. We were able to see the chefs nonverbal communication with the server and quickly noticed his attitude. They should really think about making the kitchen none visible if this is how they're going to behave. He made rude facial expression at me as we sat across from the bar and made our whole experience uncomfortable. The server again came to our table and suggested another roll. We simply gave up so we can hurry up and leave. PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE ESPECIALLY IF YOU INDEMNIFY  AS LGBT! Horrible experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Should never have gotten rid of the Hess wine! The new wine is nasty. Hopefully they will bring it back"}
{"text":"We came the other night during happy hour, and thought it was pretty good. Looking over the menu was a little confusing trying to find out what was in each roll. On the menu the rolls aren't listed alphabetically, so you have to scan the paper and try and find what you're looking for, which is a little annoying. Our table had a pretty bad wobble that needed to be fixed and the restaurant was also extremely loud. It was hard to my wife speak to me from across the table (these are the main reasons for the 3-star review).   We really enjoyed the rolls we ordered. I had the surfer roll, and the shrimp mixture was delicious, but overpowered the rest of the roll. Despite that, I really like it - I will just probably order something different next time. My wife had the chimichanga roll and she loved it. The prices weren't bad, but this was mostly because we came during happy hour.   Overall, it was a positive experience and we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here on vacation with my best friend and her mom. Wow, this place is mmmMmmm! The snow peas were delicious and the fried apples dessert is a MUST TRY!!! Parking lot is big (from what I remember) as well as the restaurant itself. Has booths and bar stools for you to hang out at as well as a bar itself. The waiters are super friendly, prices are a bit high, but it is sushi. Otherwise, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Bad, watery sushi. Overly sweet rolls. Good french fries (huh? at a sushi place?) Overpriced drinks. At least the company was good. Go across the street to the Persian Room."}
{"text":"Usually when I leave one of our regular sushi places we're satiated and  $30 richer.  It's not that this is a bad place but value for money for pseudo Japanese cooking is not to be found. The udon was thin and the accompanying dish was forgettable. Yes there's sushi in the name but that doesn't excuse the lack of imagination on the entree list.   Sushi wise the Spicy cowboy roll was spicier than their wings and is a really good roll.    Height on most chairs make it obvious, along with no kids menu that your sushi loving 5 year old  should go fishing elsewhere.  Having said that  $9 bento box with katsu is pretty good value though the miso that comes with it doesn't  stand up alongside a premium packet of miso from Lee lees   Was quiet ( 230 on a Sat afternoon)    It's just not worth the premium in relation to the good places a couple of miles away"}
{"text":"Loved this place went with my friend for a girls sushi date and we loved it! We went here and loved it! The edamame was so good we had the spicy one and the sushi rolls where amazing and for the price it was very fair! Would come again:)"}
{"text":"Got there for happy hour on Friday around 3pm, plenty of parking and places to sit. Very nice place, cool bar seating, and nice booths. TV's everywhere. We started out with Edamame, Spring Rolls, Calamari, and Volcano Chicken appetizers. All of these were delicious.COWGIRL Sushi which was spicy yellowtail roll topped with sliced yellowtail, spicy mayo and Sriracha, garnished with scallions. I'm not much on Sushi but this was very good! Finished off with their Crispy Wings a dozen crispy chicken wings tossed in a sweet spicy asian sauce served with wasabi ranch, these are Da Bomb!! We go here a lot because of these wings! Cooked perfectly and the Asian sauce is so delightful. House Cab and Tsing Tao to was it down made it a perfect afternoon!"}
{"text":"Usually I come here to pick up Togo orders, and they are very quick. There's abour 2-3 times I would receive an order made incorrectly and it was because the order was taken down wrong ( could be phone communication / connection )  The place is kinda a hit or miss for busy times. The staff are very friendly and prompted. They always are upbeat and very positive attitude! I like how they would try to make things right if I receive a wrong order. The atmosphere is very welcoming and casual. Food is great. There was 2 times when our tuna came out darker then usually and we let them know and it Never happened again. Keep in mind we love fresh sashimi."}
{"text":"The first as will be the last time I will come here. The worst place ever. Highly not recommend to come here. The food is suck, service are rude, shushi is low quality. What I'm mad the most is how disrespectful of one a waitress throw a bill right on my table, when she found out that I'm not tip her. That's so disgusting, don't come to this place. I call shade and rude for this place."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever!!! You must try the surfer and the las Vegas.   OMG!! They were both excellent.  Not your normal plain sushi.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Only reason I am giving Sushi Brokers 2 stars instead of one is the atmosphere. Which is what brought us there. My friend wanted to try it so we dragged our husbands to a date night. It is a fun, lively atmosphere.  That is where the compliments end. Let's start with the food. Ordered a whole bunch of sushi rolls. After 45 minutes they came out. They were mediocre. I ordered fried rice and the veggie lettuce wraps. The fried rice was fried rice. Not bad, not fantastic. The lettuce wraps were the most disgusting things I have tasted. The veggies were SO salty I couldn't even finish them. I was curious about my friend's side of wasabi mashed potatoes. I was sorry I tried them. They were waxy and had a funky sweet taste to them. Everyone was not impressed with the food.  Our server was bitchy and incompetent. She seemed very impatient with us. Didn't bring silverware and ignored us most of the time. The icing on the cake was when we were leaving and heard her bitching out someone on her cellphone in the parking lot. Fun stuff."}
{"text":"I come here a lot... And I like it... BUT..... When the 22 oz sake bomb is gone before you get any sushi... There is a problem. Add on the fact that its $16 bucks per roll. #sushibrokers #failboat"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in the hostesses here. I love all the other sushi broker locations. We went there tonight to have a drink, and the hostess asked us if we wanted to sit outside, I replied to her 'what about the haboob, I don't know if that is a good idea.' (Since every phone in the area had received the warning) she snakily replied 'sorry I am not a meteorologist, I don't know the forecast'. Her cohostess even looked at her in shock because she was so rude. Not the type of greeting I would expect when I am will to go to a nice restaurant in a nice area and spend money on food and cocktails. We left and went to Nico. Where they were happy to accommodate us last minute (even though they were busy)."}
{"text":"Went here 2 times, once with a group and again at the whim of my mother and both times I was not very impressed. Sushi was americanized and not that good  and was rather high priced for as unimpressive as it was."}
{"text":"Serviceable sushi and decent cooked food at prices a little beyond what you would expect, all served in a rebuilt 1980's Pizza Hut. I've been three times in the weeks that they've been open and have brought a hopeful attitude each time. And each time I've received pretty good service (forgiving the newly-open-restaurant learning curve), but have been a little let down when I receive the food. Sushi is pretty standard, but about 25% more in price then you would pay at other, more creative independent operations. Most of the rolls contain cooked fish rather than raw, and there's nothing too exotic on the menu...kind of a beginner's sushi place. Cooked food was pretty good, pan-asian (in the same way that PF Changs is \"pan asian\") but nothing particularly stands out. Atmosphere is kind of the problem...it is a little loud and tries to be clubby, despite the aforementioned 1980s Pizza Hut  rebuild. Also they only serve the big, 22 oz Japanese beers, so if you want a beer, youd better want two beers. Definitely not kid friendly...no boosters or high chairs, no kid menu the one time we did bring our little one. All in all a decent option in the neighborhood, but if you are looking for something authentic or creative, move on to the better, lower key options in town like Hana, Hiro, or Yasu."}
{"text":"my cousin wanted to come here instead of a sushi place I wanted to go to on Camelback and I wish we didn't. I ordered the las vegas roll and it wasn't very good but I'm use to better sushi in shitty cali."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you get. Not very good sushi at all. The building is literally an old Pizza Hut and the clientele are kids with their families after little league practice. Not a great dining atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was overall just not a good experience. It started out with our waitress answering many of our questions with \"I don't know\" then besides grabbing our order and bringing out our drinks she was nowhere to be found until she brought our check. The edamame was by FAR the best part of the meal, which is why I give this 2 stars instead of 1. My wife ordered an $8 Moscow Mule that probably did not have any vodka in it at all. Our sushi was at least edible but not worth the price one bit. $6.50 for an alright California roll is not good and $7.75 for an Alaska roll with poorly cooked Salmon, BAD. Our other rolls were decent but again, way overpriced. Then taking a step away from the food, they were playing not that great of music and it was much too loud, but that is obviously my opinion so you may like it. But the kicker, despite the World Cup being played they had CANADIAN FOOTBALL on their TV's! Why?! Lastly, we were not even thanked by our waitress or the hostess as we left, not even a goodbye or have a nice night. Save your money."}
{"text":"I live in Gilbert and my family loves Downtown Gilbert and the restaurant scene. We've been to every single restaurant and have our favorites. When we heard A sushi place was opening we thought: our lives are complete! Lol  Well, not so much. We really wanted this place to be a hit but it fell short of the even the lowest expectations. We were greeted by a man who appeared to be hustling business. Friendly guy and he said it was a soft opening and it's open seating (aka we're not busy).  Menu looked amazing and we learned they serve more than just sushi.  We ordered spicy edamame and Vegetable tempura as starters. My daughters ordered 4 different rolls. I ordered the Volcano Chicken with Fried Rice and my wife had the Crispy Wings.   The blonde Asian waitress was cute and friendly and seemed to know what she was doing.   The first thing that came out was two sushi rolls. I hate when they serve entrees before the starters. It makes everyone at the table feel awkward that only one person is served and eating.  The rolls were okay but we have had better. Then the edamame came out. BOMB! But cmon how can you get edamame wrong? The Volcano Chicken was gross. Pieces of chicken fried and soaked in Frank's Louisiana hot sauce and accompanied with bland Fried Rice. For $9.99, it wasn't worth it. The rest of the rolls finally came as did the wings. All okay. But wait.....what about the Tempura? We had to remind the waitress and she said it takes a little longer for tempura. Really? I wanted to say \"girl, you're not dumb, don't give me that crap!\" Lol  The tempura came and it was cold. Limp. I told the waitress and she said said \"sorry\" and that was it.   Well, we're not idiots and know they're probably getting their sh-- together. But to me, you should want to \"wOw\" the first patrons of your new restaurant. Wasn't a lot of effort.  We might try them again but after a $78.11 bill, it'll take a lot. This is one place we'll avoid. Hope they get it together."}
{"text":"Everything about Sushi Brokers is amazing! The chimichanga sushi is oh my gosh good! Lychee Bellini will also have you feeling right! Edamame (spicy/garlic) is hmm hmm good too! The music is always right on point as well. My absolute To go happy hour spot."}
{"text":"Best sushi in AZ, hands down! Sushi Brokers offers fresh fish prepared in the most creative ways! I prefer to go during happy hour, as most of their specialty rolls are pretty expensive. The Sunshine Roll, Las Vegas Roll, and Damn Good Roll are just a few of my favorites here, I could go right down the list naming other rolls I love here! Our service was a bit slow but uber friendly, so it was impossible to be mad at her!   I'm going to make it a point to try their bento box for lunch ASAP!"}
{"text":"Coming from San Francisco I'd like to think I know good sushi. I'm still on that mission to find the best sushi spot in AZ!   Last night we decided to try Sushi Brokers in attempt to finally find THE sushi spot we'd frequent. The decor was upscale, the prices are upscale but I was hoping for that upscale taste. Unfortunately, Sushi Brokers didn't have that. Or maybe we went on an off night."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've tasted the 5 months I live in PHX. We went for happy hour. Good prices."}
{"text":"The quality of the sushi and rolls does not reflect the prices they charge. There are far better options in the area at a better price point. Sushi-holic is the best in the area.    I went on a Sunday evening and the staff all seemed to be checked out. Actually, the service was just flat out terrible. All the servers and chefs sat in the corner of the bar, by the registers, and did not pay attention to one guest.   The Sushi Brokers near Kierland is much better, but still overpriced.  I have found, and will continue to go to, better options in the area."}
{"text":"I love going to Sushi Brokers and find it really yummy, and happy hour & lunch prices are good, but the regular menu is just a bit too expensive! But the salmon sushi is really good and fresh, and the Sanchez roll (eel and jalapeño) is my absolute fav. Oh and they make a great spicy mayo if you wanna switch it up from soy. ;) I'm attaching a picture of the lunch Bento Box I got the other day - all of that was only $11! Kara gave great service and the food was delicious as always."}
{"text":"Glad to see Gilbert is stepping it up and getting a real sushi restaurant. I came here with some friends for a little bite. I've been to the other two locations in North Scottsdale and Arcadia, so my expectations were very high.  We started with the spicy edamame, the first time I've had it, and it was really awesome. I felt like I could have ordered a little bowl for myself.  We decided to go for it and make a run on the menu... so we ordered the Chef's sashimi plate and about six rolls. I'm so full now I may fall asleep.  Loved the lollipop roll, it was fun and since I don't like rice, it was a great fix. The Chef's sashimi plate seemed a bit pricey at first ($25) but the assortment was solid and the serving size was generous. The specialty rolls were also very exciting. I enjoyed all of them.  Everything was fresh and the facility was very clean and well decorated. The service staff was very friendly. We had a delightful young Asian-ish girl take our order but the backwaiter and other servers were quick with the refills and clearing our plates (a pet peeve of mine at sushi places).  I would recommend it anytime. The bar was also full and the wine by the bottle prices were so low I thought it was a mistake. Lol.... really."}
{"text":"meh. diner quality at master-chef prices. oh well, these are high rents up here i guess. no improvement since last time. see you guys in '17.  # no pride, no quality control. bits of food all over the place. - sunomono light and delightful # tempura sauce too salty # miso soup, bland, meh ## shrimp tempura undercooked, gooey inside  ### tried to serve me old re-roasted salmon skin. as if! dry, blackened, charcoal. HOW could you serve that, sir?!  Sent back. broiled a fresh batch second round, but still meh. they just don't even try.  where's the pride??!!  HEAD TO YUME SUSHI ACROSS THE STREET FOR A SOLID 4 STAR MEAL.  this place makes me wish there were a sixth yelp star so I could have one between 2 and 1. sushi brokers isn't scary enough, but also not even rising to a meh."}
{"text":"Loud Top 40s dance-pop music, terrible service (seriously, I usually end up flagging the busser down to get my waiter if I'm at a table), but I can't stop coming here.    Rolls I could eat all day: Philly, Eel & Cucumber, Summer, Diamondback, and the Sunshine. Oh and yellowtail nigiri.  Last time we were here we tried the salmon skin roll. Our waiter told us that we have to love salmon to like the salmon skin roll. Sweet, sign me up because I do love my salmon! Incredibly chewy and did not taste like salmon.at.all. Luckily, he let us trade it out for another roll, so bonus points for that.   I highly recommend their happy hour and sitting at the bar. You can always snag a waiter at the bar, even if it's not your own."}
{"text":"We had been going to another local sushi restaraunt for quite some time due to great service,  although the food wasn't always exciting or great.  That kinda went downhill as our fav servers left.  So we decided to try something new. Sushi Brokers was a delight. The service was not only perfect, but they had amazing rolls. I definitely suggest Sushi Brokers for anyone who is looking for an exotic, and fresh taste. My taste buds are ready for another roll!  Surf and Turf was my favorite with Damn Good being a close second! We will be back. Oh, and well brand vodka is Ketel One?  I'm sold!"}
{"text":"Happy hour special is the best deal by far! We had a huge group that could eat like elephants and our bill was barely over $100. Some items were a little pricy but it was worth it because the quality was great! Overall I recommend this place for some fresh happy hour sushi!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place, I love happy hour. I have come in several times, and always get excellent customer service. No matter how far I move this will always be my favorite sushi place."}
{"text":"We are in Scottsdale for business and decided to check out this restaurant last night as it's pretty close to where we're staying. We ended up being there for happy hour and were very impressed! The fish was fresh, the drinks were delicious, the price was right and our waitress was super friendly and attentive. My only complaints would be that the women's bathroom wasn't that clean and one of the locks was broken out of the two stalls, and also we ordered a few last minute things before happy hour was over (maybe 7 or 8 minutes) but the items weren't put in time so we ended up paying full price. Otherwise, we had a great experience and we'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went in for lunch over the weekend.  The sushi is fine, nothing special.  The atmosphere, however, leaves something to be desired  -- loud, obnoxious music, dark interior, not at all inviting.  I'd rather buy the sushi at Safeway than eat here again."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Brokers. It seems like this location is the forgotten ugly stepsister or the flowers in the attic.  Too bad because you can't beat this location. So here goes. The atmosphere, great! The service, good. The sushi, awesome! The drinks, good. The rest of the menu needs attention. The food is \"meh\"at best. Decided to get the yakisoba with meat. Never had it before and it isn't something I tend  to order. I wanted something meaty. It was the worst bowl of shite I've had served to me. I swear  you can get better at Panda. I paid extra for meat. There was about 7 pieces of starburst sized bites. I don't want this place to close. So please tweak the menu!!! I beg you! There are no decent Asian places in this neighborhood. Maybe add pho? But use an experienced chef who specializes in pho. Its all in the broth. Add some poke. And use odesza radio on Spotify. Start there. Thanks! Love you guys! Chk out sushi deli in hillcrest/mission hills. Recon mission. Lol."}
{"text":"Sushi was pretty good although overpriced. Atmosphere was nice,  comfortable booths. Waitress was a little snooty but got the job done. All in all, don't know if it's worth the price."}
{"text":"I went here tonight for some happy hour sushi. I love that they have happy hour on Saturdays! I sat at the bar with a couple of friends and we had impeccable service! Not only did our food come out fast, but the servers were checking on us frequently. I've never seen such great service at a busy bar area. The sushi was very good, as well as the spring rolls! Definitely try those. I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is probably the kind of establishment in which a white supremacy group or a satanic cult would hold their monthly meetings, or worst case scenario a white supremist satanic cult."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once. Not because I hated it but because I always forget it's there! This is actually the place where my boyfriend and I had our one month anniversary AWW and where he first tried sushi. The sushi was good, but the prices were a little high. The atmosphere has a upper class bar feel, but it's also felt intimate. If RA is to much for you than you would probably prefer the environment here, but personally the prices and fish are better at RA."}
{"text":"I have only been here for lunch, not dinner or happy hour.  I think this place is pretty consistent -- service, food quality and pricing are about what you would expect of a sushi joint in this town.  The last time I was here (a few weeks ago), I had the best service experience I have had in the last ten years I've frequented the place. My server's name was Emily.  I told her my food preferences and she suggested a dish that I had never noticed on the menu or tried before and it was great. Thanks, Emily!"}
{"text":"Best cocktails of any sushi place. Try any of the signature drinks and you'll agree that their mixology is outstanding... And for a sushi Resturant. And come for happy hour; beer drinks bombers and three dozen rolls and nigiri are all on the HH menu for a super value ending at 6:30. But they gave us a little grace period  As for the sushi, it of course did not disappoint and we stuffed ourselves on HH prices.  The best part was the service. Our waitress was super and very suggestive of what her favorites were and navigating the drink menu which was a lot for a first timer trying to get our order before the end of HH  Have I found my new favorite sushi bar in phx?  I think so....  But I'm coming way before 6:30 next time"}
{"text":"Soooo.  Not the most pleasant experience.  Came here with my son who is 14 months and they don't have high chairs.  Really?  It's a restaurant.  And, the server was rude and cranky.  Food was good but based on the service and attitude I would rather go somewhere else. #FAIL"}
{"text":"Went to Sushi Brokers last night and had a good time. It was my boyfriend's first time enjoying sushi so we ordered the Vegas, the Tootsie, and my personal favorite the Surfer!! All of which came out from the barside chefs with a sense of urgency even though it was later at night. The staff was very attentive and very nice. Our server recommended some saki for us at the end, which we liked. This was my first time coming to Sushi Brokers and actually getting both good service AND Food. Maybe the night staff is better :)"}
{"text":"One of my top 3 Sushi Places in Phoenix now. The spicy yellowtail was fabulous along with the shrimp tempura! YUM! And for the non sushi eaters at your table the the California club minus the bacon won't disappoint. It was so good we ordered a 3rd round.  For cocktails the La Paloma Grapefruit went down way to quickly. . . So I ordered another.  I enjoyed the staff . . .prompt and on top of it all even to the point of chasing me down when I accidentally grabbed the check with my phone. I'm really not a dine and dasher . . . That was a first and embarrassing for me yet they handled it with respect and humor!  Well done Sushi Brokers!  I'll be back and I promise not to have you chase after me next time!"}
{"text":"I learned about Sushi at Sushi Brokers 12 years ago!  The Sushi is consistently good and chicken fried rice is unbelievable.  As most Sushi places it is expensive.  I don't appreciate an $8.00 cocktail but then again it is Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"Cozy little place in downtown Gilbert.  Staff is always pleasant. Great place for drinks & food."}
{"text":"Great spot near our house and we biked over for the happy hour, but I wouldn't come back for a full meal. The prices for happy hour are perfect and it would definitely be fun to come back with a group and hang since the inside is small but chill but the food was just meh and I don't know if it really was the sushi or if I just wasn't feeling it. Born and raised on the east coast living a quarter mile away from the ocean and I'm eating sushi in the desert...  We had the spicy tuna roll which wasn't too spicy and some other roll with crab, crunchies, eel sauce and some other stuff mixed in and that just tasted crunchy and bland. We had the crab rangoon and even that was eh. I don't mean to bash these guys too much since I know they are new and we really did enjoy being there, but as I said...in reality it might just be personal preference and that's ok too. I don't want to be here hurting anyone's feelings since food is just so personal.  Our waitress was nice and cute as was the hostess so that was cool and made us want to come back again with a group to hang out. They also have reverse happy hour so it just sounds/feels like a good place to go towards the end of the night when you want a bite and a night cap.  I want to give these guys another try and hopefully I can order something that's better but I know we will go again since its just a fun spot near our house."}
{"text":"Have eaten here quite a few times now and have to say that so far this is my favourite Sushi Restraurant.....the food is consistently good, nice drink selection, wait staff are always happy, helpful and friendly...the atmosphere is relaxed and they usually have some good music playing. It may have just been the times I have been there...but it seems to be a bit dressier than other Sushi places....I have always been casual though and no one seems to be offended! lol"}
{"text":"Happy Hour menu is pretty good. They have many specialty roles. Someone posted picture of appetizer volcano chicken. It's just small cubes of fried chicked in buffalo sauce. As a Japanese, must say quality of fish weren't so great... well i was there on Tuesday so it could have contributed."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Fish very fresh and tasty. Nice little restaurant in Arcadia. Went with a group attending the same conference. Ordered several different kinds of rolls and a few other dishes to share. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"If I could give it no star, I would. If you want fresh sashimi, do not come to this place unless you want to have stomach ache after."}
{"text":"seriously!? they kept the 70's Pizza Hut vibe with the exterior building/windows etc!?  Yes Arcadia has been waiting for a sushi place since Zen left the hood, but at least spend a few bucks on some MUCH NEEDED curb appeal, they didn't even do any landscaping either.  I'm embarrassed to drive up to the place with a friend/signifigant other etc.  PLEASE do something about this ASAP!!"}
{"text":"I had a burger here, yes a burger at a sushi place kinda weird huh? It was amazing spicy and amazing.  Trust me please trust me."}
{"text":"Great fresh yellowtail and salmon. Generous portions inside both the Cowgirl and Philly roll. Great service and solid All Day Happy Hour menu on Sundays. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"This is the spot to go with friends and celebrating events. Sushi is delicious and especially their Kobe beef burger with Hawaiian roll bun."}
{"text":"Good sushi. I won't qualify the previous statement by saying \"for Arizona\". It's 2016, fresh fish can be delivered anywhere. Staff was friendly and attentive. Our party of 5 only had one glass of water run out. We realized half way through our meal that we needed another 3 rolls and received them before we finished the first round. I would visit again."}
{"text":"I have recently fallen in love with sushi and everything to do with it. Great company, great atmosphere and great choices on the menu. Sushi Brokers has it all. The service was great, the food was even better and the atmosphere was very comfortable. So glad to have this wonderful escape right around the corner from me!"}
{"text":"Prompt service good food , took us a while after our first visit when food was good but experienced a bad server, manager took care of situation by giving us discount but that left a little scar for us to come back again even though we enjoyed sushi. But no complaints this time , really good and prompt service. Love the calamari here, California , rainbow and spicy tuna rolls were on our plane this time."}
{"text":"We were at the AT&T store next door and had time to kill. I really didn't want to go to sushi brokers but she insisted that we go for edamame and one sake bomber. Couldn't hurt right?  I am very glad I listened to her. We sat at the bar and placed our order for edamame and bombers... And I might as well throw in some yellowtail because it was good last time.  After the gentleman takes my order another man walks up and introduces himself to me. He stated he was one of the owners and he read my review on yelp and would like to make my prior experience up to me. Boy did he ever.  Service was amazing my entire stay. He brought us one of their signature creations called \"sushi pizza\" which was absolutely delicious. Just enough spice and plenty of fish. He also brought his favorite bottle of sake for us to try which was good as well. At the end of the stay he had taken care of us with the bill to make up for last time as well.   We received the VIP service the entire time but all the handouts aside..  The fact that Chris not only read my review.. But also took it to heart enough to remember my ugly face and make right by me. To me, this shows the management cares about their customers. I didn't deal with the service I did in the past this time, but you better believe I will willingly be back within his establishment again soon."}
{"text":"Sushi Brokers is great - it's a lot of fun, the food is good, and the location is perfect when I'm working in N. Scottsdale. It's a quick turn off of Scottsdale Road. They play cool music, too. The staff is super friendly and I met the owner today and he was about as nice as they come!"}
{"text":"I come from Vancouver BC aka sushi capital of North America and finding a sushi place that isn't gross here in Phoenix seemed next to impossible..... This place was a pleasant surprise. Transplant this restaurant to Vancouver and it would be 3.5-4 stars but I'm happy that I now have a sushi go to in Phoenix"}
{"text":"My Family and I have been dinning here at least twice a month since they opened and usually have great experiences.  Sadly, last night was a different story all together ;-( .  We arrived at 7:30 pm, and even thought they were pretty busy, we were seated right away.  We always start our meal with a couple orders of calamari and were very disappointed to find that the quality had changed.  The calamari they served us last night were tough and rubbery and it was obvious that their management team had selected a new vendor, and compromised quality to improve their margins.  Another dish that brings us in to Sushi Brokers on a regular basis is their Citrus Yellow Tail.  We always order it with thinly sliced jalapenos to spice it up a little bit and last nights chef served it to us with jalapenos cut so thick they would of over powered a plate of nachos. The final fail in this less than impressive dinning experience was the service.  Our waitress forgot one of our selections (woked veggies and brown rice) and when we asked her where it was, she blamed it on the kitchen and told us she would get it started right away.  After 20 minutes and another round of drinks it still hadn't come so we asked her to go ahead and make it to-go and bring us the bill.  Even though the veggies and rice were never brought to the table they were on the bill.   So we decided to stay and wait for them, which took another painful 10 minutes.  I sincerely hope your management team takes some of these criticisms to heart."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch w/ some girlfriends on the weekend, they have a pretty awesome happy hour menu.  everything we had was really good, our server was okay, but at least the food was good.  The garlic soybeans are sooooo goooood!  Looking forward to coming back w/ my sister."}
{"text":"It had been a while since I had Sushi Brokers and decided to give it a try again tonight. Let's start with the good. Service was great along with the atmosphere, we ordered the shrimp tempura as an appetizer which also was good. Then things took a turn for the worst. As I write this review my stomach is still turning. Our sushi was mushy, warm, and clearly not fresh. I've had better spicy tuna from the refrigerator section at frys grocery store. Sorry I will not be coming back unless it's for drinks and apps for happy hour."}
{"text":"I've been back several times since my first review... my girlfriend loves their sushi. And I agree, their sushi is really good. They have a sushi chef that makes his own special \"off menu\" items and they are delicious!  But again, the staff is spending more time chatting in the corner than waiting on the client. We have to request food, drinks and water refills half the time!   Most of the staff appears to be more focused on \"catching up\" with each other and not with the customer."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was not remarkable and their surfer  roll was horrid.. They don't give you a menu which is weird...just a weird vibe in general..."}
{"text":"First time here and good experience. The chimichanga roll is delish and the Tokyo colada! My mom loved it too. Friendly servers... can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Love the fact that they close at 1am. This is the closest Asian food I could get near the Princess Hotel (Fairmont). Food is great too, can't beat the happy hour prices."}
{"text":"The sushi pizza is really unique and tasty.  The sushi is always fresh and good.  The prices are pretty high compared to other similar spots though so I was torn between 3 and 4 stars."}
{"text":"Nice sushi, drinks and atmoshpere. The service is spot on and they can answer any questions you might have with menu items. Great sushi rolls and some American stuff for the non sushi lovers. I like this so you can hang with people that don't engage sushi and still enjoy.  Try las vegas, cowgirl,cowboy, rainbow and tempura veggies. Lovely cocktails with reduced pricing for happy hour,"}
{"text":"Quick service, sushi was on point and amazing. Clean place great music, I'd def be coming back and doing lunch or happy hour here."}
{"text":"I recently discovered Sushi Brokers and ended up loving it. The sushi is all so good! My favorite is the surfer roll, but you can't go wrong with any of them.  The service is awesome. Every time I have gone everyone has been great. Tonight we sat at the sushi bar and Steve was our server. He was on top of everything and did a fantastic job! I definitely recommend trying this place out!!"}
{"text":"I usually order to go from here since we have a 3 year old who doesn't like sushi. Postmates used to deliver but stopped so now I go in. All the staff was usually so nice but the person Had tonight was not.  I left and went to sushiholic and was extremely impressed. Sushi brokers needs to improve if they want to compete with this place"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Tried for the first time today... twice as much $ as other sushi places and half the size portions. Not only that but the portions we got were nearly inedible. Salmon was foul fishy smelling specialty rolls were tiny. With so many other incredible choices in the area I don't know why anyone would choose this one."}
{"text":"I moved in to the area a few days ago, I find it to be beautiful, classy, and expensive. My search for affordable sushi in a 10 minute radius from my apartment lead me to Sushi Brokers. The Brokers came through and made my early dinner quite enjoyable and affordable!   Service was spot on, everything came at a pretty rapid pace. There was music, but it wasn't a club or party atmosphere. I had my water glass filled just about 5 times during my 30 minute dinner. Kudos for staying on top of that, you need to stay hydrated in Phoenix or you will have a bad time.  I started with a chicken appetizer. Lightly fried chicken served with both terrryaki sauce and buffalo sauce on the side. The portion was solid for this discounted app and I enjoyed mixing the sauces and the chicken cubes in the rice. Nothing mindblowing or creative, but well executed and filling.  I tried a spicy salmon, and a spicy yellowtail maki style roll. Each roll was a generous 8 pieces, and packed full of fish. I liked that the fish was not pulverized, but rather cut in to cubes with a knife. The fish is paired simply with sliced cucumber.  I ended up with a very filling sushi dinner and app for well under 20$. That's a huge win in my book. I'll be back to try the other aspects of their happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Has been a decent place to always go for sushi...however last few times we have been in it hasn't delivered. Tonight was a turning point. Wanted a good Mother's Day dinner out. Sat up at bar, put in some sushi orders as soon as we sat down and was warned that they were a little backed up at sushi bar, about -~20min, said that was fine. And ordered an appetizer. 25min later app came out.....over an hour later we asked for manager because our order of 1 ONE (yes one roll) had still not arrived (and yet a couple received their order of a few rolls next to us at sushi bar about 10 min after their order) we asked for our order to go, and AMAZINGLY it was ready and put into a box :-:/ No complaints about waitress, very sweet. But not sure we'll ever be back, has been going downhill in service and quality of sushi for awhile and this might have done it for us. Try out Kodo Sushi down the road, 100% better sushi/quality, rolls are amazing and much more personal service!"}
{"text":"Food is ok if you want a hip place during happy hour its a great spot.  However, here is a problem that to me shows the owner doesn't care about customers and clearly is only about money.  I ordered a sake from the 6 or 7 they had to chose from.  It was so sweet I couldn't even drink it.  So, I said to the waiter, \"Im sorry, but this sake is so sweet its like a desert wine, can I just have the draft saki please instead.\"  His response was,\" Im sorry its not me, but the owner has stated that you cant send anything back, so I am going to have to charge you, I mean, you ordered it, you didn't know it was sweet?\"  WTF?  I said, \"no, because YOU don't post the sake ratings on your menu like they do at most sushi places.\"  He looked really confused.  I explained about sake ratings -15(sweet) through +15 (dry)  (For those of you who dont know, here you go  http://www.sakeexpert.com/smv.php)  I said,\" If I has seen a -10 or -12 next to this I wouldn't have ordered it.  He never even heard of that, which I find odd for a bar tender at a sushi place.  Basically a word to the owner.  This is not how you get repeat business.  Put the ratings next to your saki and then you won't have this problem.   Finally, this place is extremely over priced.  $7.50 for a tuna roll? Should be $4.50 like it is everywhere else in town $14 and up for \"specialty rolls,\" which are mostly California rolls with some other things on top.  I have been here a lot over the years and it seems like lately the quality has just gone extremely downhill.  My wife order a glass of Pinot Noir wine which had turned and was warm probably bottle open for two days, but we didn't say anything because of the prior sake incident."}
{"text":"This is my least favorite sushi place in the valley.  I think gas station sushi would have tasted better.  The edamame wasn't cooked properly and had too much salt, the tuna in the Alaskan roll tasted like it came straight out of a can, and the soda was flat.  The only thing that tasted okay was the water."}
{"text":"Meh. Food was OK, loud music, OK service, pricey sushi that ain't better than cheaper places. Bill for two was close to $100. Can go to much better places for that price.   Crowd is 30s, but lots of people who are definitely trying to impress someone with their fashion. Lady next to us was 40 something dressed like she was in here 20s. Lots of unfit guys trying to wear skinny shirts, flashy watches and white sunglasses...if you know the type.  Not sure if this is a bar trying to be a restaurant or a restaurant trying to be a bar. Too loud for a restuarant, but the place was full, so what do I know! Bill would need to be half the price to come back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for happy hour.  It's usually pretty loud and pretty crowded.  The Cowgirl Roll (spicy yellowtail) is really good.  Their salmon sashimi is also very good.    Their happy hour prices are still pretty high though...  Our server's name was Boobie, which we thought was pretty funny.  At least that's what was printed on our receipt."}
{"text":"If you go to Sushi Broker expecting a great rowdy bar atmosphere with good strong cocktails and ok food, you'll probably have a good time.  Even though the dining space is far larger than the tiny bar area, the bar's what it's all about.  Lots of regulars from the nearby businesses and apartments, with a few neighborhood families and the usual Scotts. smattering of tourists.  Spillover ends up on the patio seating.    Food's ok.  Better after a few cocktails.  Prices are reasonable for lunch and happy hour.  They have a good wine list, but the wines I've ordered in the past have been tasteless, watery, so I stick to the stellar cocktails.    Sushi Broker isn't a place for children, unless you're ok with your child hearing the f-bomb wafting in from the bar every 10 seconds.  Oh - of course not from our table ;-)"}
{"text":"So good. Unique delicious rolls. Great atmosphere heathy options as well. My favorite is the lollipop roll great place for date night!"}
{"text":"Had Kylie as my server for lunch today, she was super sweet and very attentive! The food was also amazing as usual."}
{"text":"Unbelievably fresh fish! The happy hour is the best in town. Highly recommend the role call the surfer. You will not believe the taste unbelievable!! I was really impressed with the freshness of the Fish. The tuna and the yellow tail could be the best I've had in town."}
{"text":"We came here for our Anniversary. Perfect hot little spot that is not crowded!!! Manager was so hospitable especially when they found out it was our anniversary. We ordered the calarmari to start with the calamari sauce!!!! Delicious. Next up Las Vegas roll, Cowboy roll. Then the spicy sprimp and salmon. Very yummy. The Sushi chef then made his special own rolls for us complimentary to try which was to die for. Manager then told us to pick a dessert complimentary for our anniversary!! Getting the banana one. I am sure it will be as amazing as the food"}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi in north Scottsdale, hands down.  The selection of rolls is endless, the quality of them is top notch and they're not small either.  Some places will give you tiny little rolls, not here.  All the rolls are well portioned and should easily be split with another person if ordering more than one.  Service has always been spotty as far as checking in with the tables but the quality of the sushi keeps me coming back.  I know that if I'm in a hurry, I probably don't have time to stop in, but otherwise, it's my first choice when in that part of town."}
{"text":"I really like sushi broker. Don't expect authentic sushi here but it's mad tasty! Best of of all is their happy hour menu. It's 3-6:30 everyday. They offer reverse HH too. There's 20-30 food items and discounted drink specials. My favorite roll is the surfer and I think it's the most expensive one on their HH menu at $12.75, def worth it though! Another plus is that they have tons of tvs for your sporting needs. Really fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Visited twice in the span of my four day visit to AZ! I couldn't get enough of the volcano chicken and sushi crunch roll. The restaurant staff were very personable and indulged our table in kind conversations."}
{"text":"Eeew. I eat sushi once or twice a week on average,  and normally love it.  The sashimi tasted rubbery and old,  and the rainbow roll was awful.  I'll stick with Masa, and even make the drive up to Sapporo."}
{"text":"Hands down best Sushi in Scottsdale! My favorites are yummy roll and add cucumber salad on top, surfer roll rolled in cucumber, lollipop and the volcano chicken. Great happy hour everyday. Be sure and order the surfer roll with cucumber so GOOD! Sushi pizza is a favorite also."}
{"text":"In town on business and was taken to Sushi Brokers -- I'm not a sushi expert so I can't comment on how it compares to other locations on price, but I thought the meal and experience were very good.  We started with Shrimp Tempura which were delicate and tasty.  All the food was delivered timely and with a smile.  I don't remember all the sushi and rolls we ordered, but two stood out as unique: the chimichanga rolls and surfer rolls.  The chimichanga rolls had a great southwestern flavor, were lightly fried and had a sauce with some kick -- tasted great with the Kirin we were drinking.  The surfer rolls were a meal in themselves, with several kinds of fish in the roll and topped with a cream sauce with chunks of shrimp in it -- yum!  Definite recommendation."}
{"text":"Service and sushi were great. Nice happy hour.  Biggest problem loud annoying electronic music...it has to go."}
{"text":"First time here and not too sure what to expect. Walked in and the place is packed. Booths and bar tables. The place is loud with some good music playing. Let me clarify. Place was loud with everyone eating, drinking and having a good time. Very upbeat environment.   We started out by ordering the eel cucumber roll, Shrimp Tempura roll, and Rainbow roll. I know my bad, I forgot to order the Surfer. Next time. The sushi was really good. Fresh and good. My wife really like the shrimp tempura but I'm not picky. Liked them all.   I ordered the fish tacos. The soft tortillas were a little hard and the salsa was a little overpowering. Didn't taste the fish as much as the salsa. So the tacos were okay. Not great.   My wife had the Yakisoba chicken. It had mushrooms, carrots, Broccoli, onions, and zucchini with thinly cut chicken. Loved the noodles and the sauce. Very tasty but the chicken was a little dry. Seemed like it was a little overcooked. My son had the teriyaki chicken dinner. He said the chicken was good and moist and he gobbled it all up. It came with rice and vegetables. I think it had zucchini, mushrooms and a ton of onions.   Service was very good. Our server greeted us right away and got us our drinks. Our food came fairly quickly and he was constantly refilling our water glasses and checking up on us.   So overall, really good sushi, okay dinner entrees and great service with a vibrant atmosphere. We enjoyed ourselves and will probably come back so I can order this famous Surfer roll (thanks Bonnie E)"}
{"text":"This happy hour is the best kept secret in town. They have deals and fabulous food that you can not get anywhere else. Service is probably 3.5 stars, but food is 5. Cowgirl roll, Volcano Chicken and Crab Rangoon are my favorites."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food!  From the first day we ate here we come back weekly for the bento box/ happy hour....we are true sushi lovers.   Misty always greets us with a smile and not only remembers our names but says them correctly! (Rare)  They are VERY accommodating with customizing any/every roll.....this is something many sushi places will not do.   They will accommodate little or no rice which is very nice.    The staff seems to really have a connection with the customers which is what makes eating out an experience.   Can't wait for the upcoming patio! We will continue to come back weekly for the customizable sushi, bento box, and happy hour specials.....and of course the amazing service from misty and all the sushi chefs/managers."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi I've had here in Phoenix. I've tried a lot of sushi spots around the area but nothing compares to Sushi Brokers. Get there early, they get busy. Awesome happy hour! Owner frequents the spot - great quality control.  Bottom line, their fish is top quality, FRESH! They have an amazing selection of specialty rolls. Must tries are:  Hot lips roll Damn good roll **must try** Sunshine roll  Of course, you need to get a bowl of their garlic edamame and their crab puffs, so good.  Awesome selection of alcoholic beverages as well.   So, if you are near Sushi Brokers are are looking for the best sushi in town, stop by, you own't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sushi amazing! Went for lunch... The two waitresses were immature and no personality .. Yes.. The looked nice... But both had attitude!  Will go back for the sushi for sure! Just hope next tine I get better service. I'm sure if I was a hot man... They would hv been a lot nicer ... Sad"}
{"text":"Lunch hour: place is busy, but   seating was quick, server was funny, pleasant and enjoyable. The rolls are the bomb! Easy choice to come back!"}
{"text":"I tried sushi broker for the first time today for lunch and I was not pleased with the quality what so ever. The sushi taste like it was not fresh and was used from last weeks left over dinner rush. The lunch prices they charge are fairly reasonable, but do not match the prices they have online or the quality it should be. I definitely will not return to this place. There are much better sushi places around that have better quality for the same price."}
{"text":"Okay, one full star lost for the foul aroma in the bathroom. That's a HUGE peeve of mine.  Had the Cowgirl, the California Club, the Rainbow, and the Spider rolls, and also teriyaki, and Katzu bento boxes.  The food was delicious! Based on that, alone, I'd recommend this place.  The atmosphere is pleasant, and it's a very open, and welcoming feel.  The prices are not exorbitant, but I think a bit on the high side.  I'm not in this area a great deal, so I'm not likely to return, but if I were close by, and hungry, I'd come back."}
{"text":"Ordered Sushi and explained that we had allergies to certain foods and we stress the importance of not having those items in our order. We have ordered takeout service from this restaurant three times(well over $80 each time) and all three times they have included items that I have been highly allergic to; Obviously they don't take in consideration other peoples conditions when ordering food. We have also went in person to have dinner there and once again the items I'm allergic to were actually in my entree. The  last time we did complain and the waitress let us know that we did not advise her of the allergies. Overall the food was mediocre. I would not recommend this place for outstanding sushi. The fried rice was really good, great flavor.  Very family friendly."}
{"text":"Sushi was good and they had a decent selection for happy hour.  There wasn't anything special about their sushi rolls that stood out from another place.  Would recommend as a good place for lunch."}
{"text":"We came for a quick sushi bite, and ended up staying for an hour.  Drinks - on point (Paloma is delicious)  Sushi - delicious (Sanchez and the Hawaiian roll, were great, and snow crab nigiri was awesome) and McKenna was an awesome server!  We will be back"}
{"text":"The best happy hour sushi in town! Also if your a dessert fan then order the empura apple with vannilla ice cream, you will not be dissapointed...."}
{"text":"As I sit here at Sushi Brokers and eat my 3 rolls I feel rather unimpressed with the quality of fish, rice and seaweed. It's certainly not the worst sushi I've ever had but it's far from the best. I would say mediocre at best, and with that I'm being generous.   Not recommending. Not returning."}
{"text":"I'm determined to try every sushi place in the Phoenix area and with Sushi Brokers having a happy hour and a reverse happy hour how could I pass them up?  A spacious restaurant, that was pretty empty for the lunch time happy hour, I decided to sit at the bar. They have a good assortment of sushi rolls, appetizers and discounts for alcoholic drinks available for happy hour. Since I shared lunch with another, I got to share apps and sushi rolls, no drinks this time around.  For appetizers, Vegetable Tempura and Calamari and for rolls we got the Spicy Tuna (my go-to) and a Crunchy Roll.  Vegetable Tempura- thick, crispy battered vegetables (sweet potato, zucchini, mushroom and broccoli) Calamari- tender rings of squid, lightly battered and seasoned served with a Buffalo Wing type dipping sauce. I thought the dipping sauce was very zesty and tangy and would've preferred something else. Spicy Tuna- typical, 8 pieces to this roll and good tasting Tuna with a balance of heat and warm flavor of sesame oil. Crunchy Roll- Tempura shrimp with imitation crab meat, topped with avocado and unagi (eel) sauce. I thought this roll was a bit too mushy or wet in texture. The mouth feel was too soft for my liking. I don't know how this roll cost way more than the Spicy Tuna as it wasn't as good.  Service was kind of lacking/awkward, as we were welcomed from one server who told us to let him know when we were ready who later disappeared for 15 min, from ordering from the sushi chef behind the bar and had another server take care of our checks and water, but good quality food none the less for the price paid. Thank you based happy hour (TYBHH).   Will return for happy hour and for the Lucky Buddha Beer I saw available on the menu."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in for happy hour last night, and while the bartenders were really friendly, everything else left me disappointed.   We ordered two pieces of the salmon sushi, a spicy tuna roll, caterpillar roll, vegas roll, and two other rolls that  I can't remember. Wow, now that I type that, we ate a ridiculous amount of food. Anyways, I really liked the salmon and spicy tuna roll, but everything else was just okay. I definitely wouldn't have wanted to pay full price for anything. Unfortunately, the caterpillar roll was not on happy hour and it was definitely not worth $15.  When the bill came, I was kind of surprised it was $85. Granted we ordered a lot of food, but it was still happy hour. I noticed my wine wasn't discounted and the bartender said that wine wasn't on happy hour, even though the happy hour menu says \"all wines by the glass...$2 off.\" Some of the rolls that we ordered that were on happy hour also did not seem to be discounted.  For the price, I don't really think I will be making Sushi Brokers a regular happy hour spot. I think Stingray's sushi is just as good, and the happy hour is much more affordable."}
{"text":"Not a kid friendly restaurant.  My autistic son was crying and we were not able to get him quieted down fast enough for the owner so we were asked to leave.  I wish my son was better behaved and I feel bad for anyone who's lunch was disturbed by his crying but this incident was very embarrassing for me and my wife and I feel it was a bit extreme and uncalled for by the owner. The management of this restaurant or in this case the owner failed to be understanding of my son's disability and treated us poorly.  I gave sushi broker one star because I am not the first yelper who has been asked to leave sushi broker and based on my personal experience and other reviews, this guy has unresolved issues and enjoys taking them out on his customers.  We must stand up for people with disabilities and so I can no longer visit this establishment based on principal, which is a shame because we always had excellent food and good service untill now.  If you choose to frequent this resteraunt I recommend you be on your best behavior, don't bring your kids or anyone with a disability or you may be unjustly asked to leave like me and others before me."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi place have eaten there four times in the last month.  Rolls are all great never been disappointed . Had the chicken lettuce wraps tonight they were great  on the sweeter side but very good . Beer is always super ice cold service is excellent  Amanda was our server she was great. I often order to go and they do a great job of packing everything I need you don't need to check for wasabi etc  price point is great I have paid more but  this place is at least as good   . Always consistent  good job folks"}
{"text":"A great go to for happy hour, the food is great and inexpensive. I always get the sunshine roll it's the best. The volcano chicken makes a great entree. I almost always have Erin as my server and she's great. She's attentive and prompt with any requests you might have. Also a great place to watch sports while you eat."}
{"text":"This place was suggested to us by a friend. We love sushi and we are very skeptical of going to new places. But hands down this is one of the best sushi places in AZ, both with the food and ambience and most definitely the service. I will definitely come here again and will suggest it to all our friends."}
{"text":"They got 3 stars  because of the amazing server that took care of us, went on a busy night on Valentine's Day super busy but our server was on top of all our needs. Food was good but over priced  I ordered the sashimi and I usually get the fish on top of the rice but they served it without rice so I asked the server if the kitchen staff could put some rice underneath, they have an open kitchen so I was watching when our server asked the \"chef\" if He could do so, he instantly said they can get it on the side! I work in a kitchen with a real Chef and every time we have a request from our costumer our chef makes sure we execute it asap.  So dinner for 2 was $70 I may come come back later though"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant in the valley.  They have one of the best HH and reverse HH.   Great sashimi. The cowboy and the DamnGood never disappoint. They have a full Japanese menu as well. Or undon noodles and sweet potatoes fries my daughters favorite."}
{"text":"I liked this place, but I hate it's location....more so the outdoor seating. It's next to the parking garage and there is alot of noise that disturbs your meal. The police are constantly called because kids joyride in the parking garage and party on the roof top, all days of the week. Car alarms go off because they rev their engines up and down the garage like it's Tokyo drift, peeling out, and have no care for pedestrians walking through.  As for the food, it tasted great. It is pricey for the portion size, but this is sushi.  Interior is beautiful, ambient.  Considering the amount of restaurants within walking distance, I could see myself possibly never going here again... unless it's happy hour and I can sit inside, or they build a sound barrier between the restaurant and the parking garage."}
{"text":"Needs improvement.  We arrived at 11:00am, at open time.  Our table was dirty and the waiter said he would be back to wipe it down, which he never came to clean the table!  Our server looked like she had just woke up, and her clothing attire was dirty.  Regardless of the above, our Sushi was tasty.  Three stars, only because the sushi was good."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in the Scottsdale area, I have to make it into Broker (It also helps that my colleague offers SB as the only choice). While the service can run a bit on the slow side, most everything is top notch and the special dishes rock. They make some of the most 'exploratory' sushi anywhere!  When it gets packed inside, the patio also works unless it's 120 outside. If that's packed, you'd best come with someone that can get you taken care of!!"}
{"text":"I ordinarily only go to Sushi Brokers for their reverse happy hour over the weekends. Good sushi at a fair price and when you're hungry later in the evening for sushi, this is the only place to go to in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Once during happy hour with friends and once I tried coming here with my family. With friends was during happy hour and only because of that was the pricing reasonable. Atmosphere is a little dark and weird. Then we tried coming here with my family (2 kids) and asked for a high chair and they said they do not have high chairs because they are going for a \"bar-like\" atmosphere. My husband asked if they don't want kids there and they said no. So rude! Kids are people too. Will not go here again even without the kids because that is such a bad policy."}
{"text":"I love Sushi Brokers! They have the BEST Happy Hour! Their drink specials are off the charts. I am not a huge sushi person.... However my best friend is... So good thing they have a diverse menu with lots of choices. Their burger is OUT OF THIS WORLD! I know right?? An awesome burger at a sushi joint... Weird right?? But it's delish! If you're in the area... Check it out!"}
{"text":"I ate here twice this month and left disappointed both times.    My first try I had the teriyaki chicken, spicy edamame and three different rolls.  The rolls were ok, just average in taste and texture.  The Teriyaki Chicken was dry and flavor less.  Fortunately the rice and vegetables were well seasoned. The mixed drinks we ordered were weak or watered down and the waitress was pretty non existent, like she was on a perpetual break.  My second attempt was worse.  My party ordered ordered garlic edamame, which was good and 4 sushi rolls. The waitress did allow my wife to reduce the spiciness of one roll, she was helpful there. I am not a big sushi eater, so I asked for the Katsu Chicken sandwich. Nobody told us there would be a long delay in delivering the sandwich. That should always be a priority of the staff to advise or remind the customer so everyone can dine together. Part of the dining out experience is that you eat together and staff needs to understand this.  Eventually, the waitress brings two rolls out and the edamame.  My family eats away at the rolls and in a bit, a waiter shows up with the third roll.  I asked about my sandwich and he stated that it does take a while, but it should be coming soon.  Well a bit more time goes by and the waitress brings by the last sushi roll.  I again ask about my sandwich and was told it would be out soon. Now it seemed to us that the rolls were taking a bit long to come out of the kitchen, yet we decided that it was a good thing since I was waiting for my order. About 15 minutes after our last roll comes out, I see my sandwich coming.  She puts it on the table and I asked her if I could have a box to go, as I didn't want to rush my dinner and have my family wait for me to finish. Again, the waitress had no concept or understanding of what I was saying.  I specifically told her it was unacceptable to bring my plate out when the others were already done with their meal. She was not apologetic or understanding.  I was very disappointed. FYI: the Katsu Chicken patty was was good, but they sure skimped on the sauce. Kind of hard to call it Katsu Chicken with no sauce!  There was just a light drip or drizzle on the bun, no taste of the sauce at all. The potato and sweet potato fries were good, though.  When I got home, I felt the need to update the manager, so maybe the next time a customer orders foods with different prep times the staff could perform better.  I did not reach the manager of the Gilbert location that night, somehow I got the other locations manager.  He took my information and told me a Gilbert manager would be calling.  Well, I did receive a call tonight.  After explaining what happened, he suggested I come back in for a third try and he would credit me with $25.  I told him that would be hard as my family had already left, as we are on vacation.  I will be here a bit longer, but I am by myself.  These visits to the restaurant were a special treat to my family and friend, as we heard how good these locations are. Now, I have to decide if I want to try them for a third time or even trust them to give me the $25 discount.  I was told if the manager was not there, just talk to the other managers, tell them my story and they will provide the discount.  Wouldn't it make you feel better to have a voucher that could be used on my next trip here?  With this level of service, why should I trust them?  I would recommend using another restaurant until they fix their staffing problems."}
{"text":"Great Sushi...HORRIBLE service!! I have eaten here alot... only because the sushi is so good!...But the service is so bad, every single time, I honestly dont think I have ever gotten good service. I have been here on a slow Tuesday afternoon and a busy weekend night and the service is always lousy! Such a shame...."}
{"text":"Awesome staff! I was able to get service right away even on a slightly busy night. Sushi tastes amazing and I would suggest the Cowgirl roll or Diamond back if you like spicy!"}
{"text":"Delish is all I need to say.. this place is very popular for Happy Hour. Get there early, by 5:30 the place is almost full. Great Half price sushi and drinks."}
{"text":"Our go to spot for sushi from here on out. The chimichanga roll is the best sushi roll that I have had since moving here and man oh man I could probably eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner. Thanks so much to the bartender I think Chris was his name, he provided excellent service and delicious drinks."}
{"text":"Sushi brokers was my go to sushi restaurant  for the past 4 years. The service has always been terrible but I have been able too look past that as I favor all of their speciality rolls. This Sunday we went for Mother's Day and once again the service was terrible. Truthfully there are quite a few good servers out there I have no idea why sushi brokers consistently hires bad waitresses. I'm not a very difficult person but after 10 minutes with empty water and ice tea glasses, I finally had to ask the bus boy to please get us refills. This happened 3 times that night as our server was no where to be found. Anyway the worst part of the night and the reason for the review, was the food poisoning that I got within 30 minutes of eating. I have never been so sick in my life. We ordered the sushi pizza, the spicy tuna and the cowboy roll. All which contain raw tuna. We noticed for the first time that the sushi didn't have the usual fresh taste it normally does but ate it anyway. Big mistake. When dealing with raw fish you should be held to a different standard. I feel sick just thinking about how violently ill we got from eating here. Suffice to say we will not be returning and advising our friends to avoid sushi brokers as well."}
{"text":"My usual place is closed on Sunday's, so I ended up at Sushi Brokers because the craving wasn't gonna die. The sushi was just average, but my service was fantastic. Madelyn was friendly, attentive and timely, even to a mom all by herself to enjoy a quiet meal for once. I'll be back just because of her."}
{"text":"What a disappointing experience. We went on the Sunday before memorial around 5pm for happy hour. It was open seating, and after choosing a booth we uncomfortably waited for about ten minutes before being greeted and offered water.   We ordered appetizers, garlic edamame and volcano chicken. The garlic on the edamame was burnt and gave it a bad flavor. The volcano chicken was delicious.   We also ordered a crunch roll and a surfer roll. The crunch roll just tasted....off. And there was no crunch to it at all, the shrimp inside was kind of soggy and soft. The surfer roll had a nice flavor, although it's difficult to eat with a pile of shrimp and \"krab\" on top.  I noticed that almost all of the rolls have some kind of cheap \"krab\" filler, but the prices are nowhere near what I'd consider cheap.   Service throughout the meal was impossibly slow and completely uninterested. My water (which also tasted off) had a large black hair in it, all that was offered was a replacement water, nothing else.   Downtown Gilbert is in need of a quality sushi joint, unfortunately Sushi Brokers is not it. I don't know if this location has different management, but the north Scottsdale location doesn't even seem like the same restaurant it's that much better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi spots in Scottsdale.  The food is awesome and great wine selection as well."}
{"text":"I came with a friend and his girlfriend and had a terrific time! Highly recommend this place if you're looking for quality sushi paired with quality pricing! Sushi brokers is a must!!"}
{"text":"Ahhh I have never been so upset with a restaurant that I signed up and logged on to complain but here it goes.    First we were talked into going here by 1 friend in our group when we arrived we were greeted at the door by a 20 something piece of eye candy that looked put out by our party and were told to sit anywhere.  Second after we were sat we had 2 colorful pieces of paper tossed on our table and told we could order off the orange happy hour menu in 15 minutes. Thats it no what would you like to drink or anything.           Good thing we wanted happy hour because the waitress didn't return till happy hour had started.  Third now I take full responsibility for the group I was with. We are a bit loud and a bit well... overly fun but... we don't deserve rude comments from our server about our age in relation to our maturity and the snotty faces and gasps if she didn't agree with what we were discussing. NOT HER PLACE!!!   The food was at best decent and I agree with the rubbery tuna and over sauced rolls. It is over priced if you are not willing to wait for happy hour.   Honestly I didn't see a manager of any kind during our entire visit. As I would have complained then considering I run a restaurant and know it is always best to speak to a manager.   I would never recommend this place or treatment to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been for lunch Bento Boxes and rolls twice now.  I'll be back!  It's nice to have another option in the 'hood.  I like Stingray better but Sushi Brokers will certainly be in the rotation.  The veggies on the Bento Boxes is a nice treat.  I like that the rolls are topped with more fish or shrimp in addition to what's inside.  I've had the Hawaiian and the Surfer.  Hopefully there will be another Deal Chicken or Living Social for it soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The hostesses Madi & Jordan were so sweet and talked to me while i waited for my table the entire time :) Once i got sick and tired of waiting (since it was SO busy!) i moved myself to the bar where Hannah Savannah and Kevin were constantly on top of it and taking great care of me. they got themselves a regular for life :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I are creatures of habit and we have a tendency to patron the same sushi restaurants over and over again. Last night we decided to head out to Tempe to find a great new sushi place. I opened the Yelp app and low and behold, old town Gilbert had one (Sushi Brokers). So no need to continue driving to Tempe! We hadn't visited old town in quite some time, but we were so glad we stopped. Old town Gilbert has totally been revived and is lined with amazing bars and restaurants! We were on a mission to eat sushi, but so many of these restaurants were beckoning us to come in and dine. Literally every restaurant on that strip was on Yelp with either 4 or 5 stars. We fought our cravings and slowly made our way to Sushi Brokers.   It was early when we arrived at Sushi Brokers just before 7pm. We wanted to have a somewhat quiet dinner if we could help it. We were hoping to sit on the patio, but it was full. Inside the restaurant it wasn't that busy and seemed to be a bit peaceful. So, we opted to dine inside and we were promptly seated. The main restaurant began to fill quickly with dinner guests and the noise level intensified. Something about the modern industrial design of this restaurant makes everything echo. It was so loud we couldn't carry on our conversation without shouting at each other. We looked longingly at the patio wishing we had waited to be seated outside. We've been to many bustling bars and restaurants, but this noise level was unusual. If you don't mind a lot of noise and revelry, this place won't bother you a bit. If you're looking for a dining scene that is more intimate or romantic.... Either wait to be seated on the patio, or dine elsewhere.   That is the only reason Sushi Brokers didn't get 5 stars with us. The food was insanely good! The fish was amazingly fresh and the vegetables in the rolls were crisp. We ordered calamari to start and that was great. Our service was great and our server made some excellent recommendations. We ordered the chimichanga roll, cowboy roll, and we're so glad we did! I have no complaints about the food or service! Absolutely a great sushi dinner spot! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"SO good! Service was awesome and the food was even better. We showed up 5 minutes before the end of happy hour and they still gave us happy hour pricing. We had the garlic edamame and I don't think I'll ever want regular edamame again. Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing choice of rolls, sashimi and appetizers. Try the Surfer roll. It's amazing. Hit up happy hour for a great selection of discounted rolls, drinks & apps."}
{"text":"Best in Az.  I love this place.  It's by far the best we can get in the az area.   I've been coming to this location for years.  I love that they keep it all clean and simple.  This place is legit and I am very picky about going out to eat"}
{"text":"I love sushi brokers!! I eat hear once a week on there happy hours in the weekends. Really good quality and cheap!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and even better Happy Hour daily from 4-6:30!  Ask for recommendations on house rolls.  The chimichunga roll (which every server calls \"chimichanga\") is awesome though a little spicy."}
{"text":"Man...... First of all my waiter kept for getting to put orders in mine came out ten min after my friends I had to ask what was going on food lacks luster had better nothing like the grand opening I attended"}
{"text":"Tonight was one of the insulting, pathetic displays of customer service we have had.   My wifeis Gluten Free, and after clearly stating this to the server, and ordering a supposedly \"gluten free\" item (grilled mahi mahi on corn tortillas), they served the tacos on flour tortillas, and continued to insist they were corn tortillas.  The manager finally got involved and admitted they were flour tortillas, and the menu has a mistake.  For a Celiac, this is a pretty big mistake and can cause severe problems.  At this point, there was really nothing left to order except sashimi.  She also added on a salad, at which point the server asked if cucumbers are okay for gluten free! Clearly this restaurant needs to better train the staff on what this means.  The manager was also very unaccommodating and unapologetic. Unfortunately this is a place with decent sushi that we will never be in again due to their complete incompetence regarding accommodating special dietary requirements."}
{"text":"Mediocre to OK sushi at a high price. Happy hour is not really a happy hour, price for selected sushi is a little less than half of regular price, but you also get half the amount. One piece instead of two for sushi. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Good was ok , drinks are missing the creative craft cocktail appeal that you need to compete with the offerings downtown with all the new restaurants.  Service was also not attentive & we were forgotten about for awhile.  Hopefully things improve."}
{"text":"Their sushi is always so fresh and flavorful! Which is crazy bc if you catch happy hour or reverse happy hour you can catch some really good deals. Only problem I have it that in the 4 or so visits I've had there you have to ask for the HH menu. One time I even just looked it up on my phone. Try their calamari for starters. It's delicious! Soo soft, lightly battered and seasoned, with an amazing sauce!! Their maki rolls are endless and they get plenty of business so you'll always get really great quality!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came into Sushi Brokers yesterday for lunch and our experience was simply amazing. We were pleasantly surprised by the lunch specials they were offering, the \"Bento Box\" was perfect for a Thursday lunch! Not to mention we had a very friendly server, her name was McKenna! She was super outgoing and always checked in on us to make sure we had everything we needed. Overall great experience the food was great and the McKenna made our lunch unforgettable. Perfect way to start my weekend!! :)"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot died. The couple that owned it for authentic Japanese and it made for the best sushi ever. I want to try sushi brokers I was a little taken back. It looked nontraditional and I wasn't sure I was going to get good sushi. I ordered their lunch special which included sushi in a bento box and the results were amazing. The sushi was fantastic and so was the entire lunch. I was very impressed. I would definitely recommend this restaurant it has become one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"For the middle of the desert this sushi restaurant/ bar is wonderful. The quality and portions of sushi and sashimi is very satisfactory. the service is marginal as expected for a bar style restaurant. This is now the fourth time in the past month I have visited and have had the same quality food every time. Happy hour provides a good atmosphere with reasonably priced drinks and sushi rolls!"}
{"text":"So excited that Gilbert has a fun vibe new sushi restaurant.  Ignore the negative 2016 reviews and understand that they were having pregrand opening gliches and try them out for yourself.  Sushi was never slow (we went their 3 times before they were oficially open) - the sushi is so good, my favorite is the surf and turf (caramelized onions and peppers on top). The salmon and burger are top notch ingredients as well (grass fed, organic, gluten free).   BAD REVIEWS KILL LOCAL BUSINESSES  If you have a complaint... call the manager directly and tell them..... so they can improve and take care of you.  If it happens multiple times then I understand why you'd post a review to stop other people from going, but it could have been a fluke... think before you publicly share, because I want this sushi place to stay open for a long time."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite sushi place. I love all of the unique Spanish inspired rolls. YUM!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend to this Sushi Broker location and to start off our night, right away we were greatest with the most amazingly spirited girls. Our server Savannah was outstanding. She has such a glowing personality and an amazing sense of customer service. For sure will you be seeing us there again."}
{"text":"Sushi isn't great and prices are high. The service has been bad with long waits but it seems like once in a while it's ok.  Happy Hour prices are good and commensurate with the quality of food and drinks you are getting.  Location is nice and it's a great see and be-seen in Scottsdale type of place. If you live and work up North Scottsdale, this place is great to go with your co-workers to."}
{"text":"Ok this place would get a 5 star if it was just for the Surfer Roll. That thing was amazing.  What fell very short was that fried chicken dish in hot sauce. It was basically a Frank's Red Hot. They did the same thing with teriyaki. Both were kinda gross and uninspired. Yelp let us down on that one.  The rest of the Sushi was fine. Nothing special but fine.  The service people had zero interest. They were all congregated by the kitchen entrance texting and talking. Our waters were empty for a good 15 mins.  We might go back just for the Surfer Roll to be honest."}
{"text":"I got charged $36 for 3 drinks (happy hour)  Ciroc and I tea..bartender \" everything is on happy hour\"!  This is called gouging!  I've been going here since 2002.  Regular price for Ciroc is $14????  Food and atmosphere is good but not that good.  I will never go again!  Sad!  Tim"}
{"text":"BEST reverse happy hour in town! When I lived in Arcadia I would eat at sushi brokers all the time. It was fast service and great sushi consistency so when I moved to N. Scottsdale I was bummed out I was leaving my favorite sushi house behind until I discovered this second location! ... still stands true, fast, friendly service and consistently great sushi! Happy hour and reverse happy hour are amazing! I'm here sometimes 2-3 times a week! This location is a bit livelier too which makes for fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I frequent here a lot for the happy hour.  Their rice, the amount of rice in the roll, and how they roll their sushi are very good here, especially for happy hour prices.  We always stick with the classics: Spicy tuna, spicy yellowtail, vegetable, and  eel and cucumber rolls.  The calamari, the happy hour salad, and the tempura shrimp are some good HR appetizers that they have as well.  Try the hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail jaw) it is so good!  They give you a pretty large portion and it is served with a ponzu sauce MMMmmmm!  Fried caramel apples with  vanilla ice cream aren't too shabby either...Good bar dessert.  Happy hour starts at 4-and we usually get there by 5-5:15 to beat the crowd.   Is it THE place for hardcore sushi? No, It's not, but I would go here and eat 100 times over before you ever see me eating sushi at Ra, Satori, or Kona...ewwww yuck!"}
{"text":"Not sure how anybody that has eaten the sushi here could give anything less than 5 stars. By far the highest quality sashimi and rolls in the valley. The service and location are great too. My favorite rolls are the sunshine roll and the surfer roll. For apps I would recommend the volcano chicken and the garlic edamame. If you're in the East Valley and you like sushi, you'll love sushi brokers."}
{"text":"I Love sushi brokers they have a great tootsie maki roll that is to die for and their chicken fried rice must be made with love because I'm addicted. I'll order to go and sometimes it's a little lunch busy and I can tend to be forgotten about picking up food but otherwise- hit this place for happy hour and you won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Just slightly below average rolls. Much better sushi elsewhere in the east valley.  Attentive waitstaff, but the kitchen ruined the meal.  I would have given two stars, but the waitress bumped it up to three stars.   There were four of us.  We ordered potstickers (pretty good) as an appetizer, while three of us ordered rolls and one ordered mahi mahi.    The first roll hit the table before the app.  The app came with the next three rolls altogether.  We ordered the Hot Lips, Crunchy, Surfer, and California rolls.  They were ok, but nothing to get too excited about.    Roughly 15 minutes after everyone was finished, the mahi mahi came out.  Sooo, three of us got to wait and watch the last person eat.    The waitress was apologetic and the mahi mahi was  reported to be good.  However, it really sucked the life out of the meal with the delivery timing.  Without making a fuss, the waitress gave us a discount equal to the cost of the mahi mahi, so that made the disappointment a little easier to deal with.   All in all, great waitstaff and average rolls.  I want to see it work out for them, but If I try them again I'll probably look at the noodles menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. My mom and I go here almost every other to every weekend. Happy hour is a great time to go since most of the fancier sushi rolls are a bit pricey. I usually get the same thing every time and what I have tried is amazing. I've never tried anything else on the menu besides the sushi. My all time favorite fancier roll is the Las Vegas Roll so I recommend getting that your first time there 100%! A more planer roll I love is the Spicy Tuna Roll."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food because we were unable to stomach the atmosphere long enough to eat there. The restaurant was empty and from the dark bar we were shouted at to sit where we'd like. The table we chose was filthy and when I pointed out that there was food all over it the waitress said that we had simply chosen the dirty table. Her temperament was clearly off and she was not happy to have patrons, although there was no one else in the entire place. We asked for water and waited for menus. The water glasses game smudged with prints and coated in food and we left without much hesitation. Very very disappointed in the service of such a \"well reviewed\" sushi spot."}
{"text":"Food was good, rolls were extremely small and the service was very slow! Not a lot of people at all and it took forever for us to even get our check. Visiting Scottsdale won't come back to this place."}
{"text":"Best sushi happy hour in North Scottsdale. Service is usually quick and friendly. You can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"This place would have gotten more stars if it weren't for the lack of service. We waited about 15 mins before we even had someone ask to take our drink order waitress walked up right as me and my boyfriend were about fed up and ready to walk out. We got a calamari appetizer that came out with the rest of the sushi it was very bland and soggy wouldn't recommend. We got a few rolls one of which was pretty good the rest were left half eaten by my boyfriend and I who can usually clear several plates of good sushi easily. Probably won't come back as I was disappointed in the service and the food both unfortunately."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Overpriced sushi. Even with happy hour pricing. I was intrigued by the sushi pizza. But there was just something about cold sashimi on top of hot rice that wasn't right. I mean I get it. The rice has to be hot since it was fried. But having the raw fish on top was weird to me. Maybe bake the seafood too so it's like a baked dynamite or something. Service was ok. But I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"When I first walked in I already saw a Ferrari parked in front so the first thought I had in my head was that this place was fancy. Which it was! I do like the interior design and feel. It was a bit too loud for my friend and I to socialize. But that's a good thing, that means they were busy!    I came in and ordered the sashimi salad and I felt like it was drenched in the vinaigrette sauce. A bit too saucy for me..  Also the price is way too high for the quality of the sushi. I understand it's located in scottsdale but It wasn't worth it.  Other than that, if I was to return here.. I would try their burgers. Cause that's what my friend ordered and he said it was bomb lol.   Customer service was great. Our server got us everything we needed."}
{"text":"2nd time here. Both times service was friendly and food was good. This most recent time we had a spicy tuna roll and tootsie roll. Also had tuna, snapper and yellow tail sashimi. The fish was fresh and we would definitely come back."}
{"text":"It's my 2nd time @ Sushi Brokers during happy hour and I leave every time with a wide grin on my face.  The drinks are a steal during happy hour and so are the rolls.  This isn't your traditional Japanese sushi restaurant. It's more sushi fusion where they'll mix western ingredients with the rolls, such as cream cheese, bbq sauce, etc .  They are mostly lathered with lots of saucing but it's super flavorful without being overwhelming.  Definitely give it a shot. The service is great too."}
{"text":"I have a hard time accepting how boring Sushi Brokers is, but I feel like an utter fool for not predicting the outcome of our evening based solely on the name of the establishment. The food was nothing impressive. It's not terrible, but with places like Hiro and Roka Akor in the valley, it doesn't stack up. They don't seem to care that much about the quality of the food, perhaps because it's reasonable to assume that you'll be drinking and distracted, anyway.  My recommendation is thus: If you have recognized yourself as a very white person (not physically, but mentally) who would feel uncomfortable in an environment hardly reminiscent of a typical steakhouse, this'll do you just fine. If you're a discerning sushi connoisseur, however, continue on your quest. Search on, food snobs, search on."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved their pineapple roll and cucumber salad... even their miso soup was delicious. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with everybody on here about there happy hour prices. 15 $ for a roll on happy hour is ridiculous. But, the sushi is very good though. Probably the best in north Scottsdale. Like that have TVs so you can catch a game from time to time and also like the music they play. There service is very slow though, even when sitting at the bar even though they have so many employees on staff. I saw three hostess's on at one time, why for such a small place ?? More bartenders or servers. Will still go there from time to time though because the sushi is so good."}
{"text":"I don't recall much of my experience here because I haven't been back since the last time I entered this dreary dark dingy dirty scum ridden 'sushi' spot.   Seriously it's so dirty and sticky every where inside I would be terrified to eat anything that comes out of this place. Clearly there isn't much thought put into sanitation. I remember some pretty rude service too"}
{"text":"I felt the prices were steep considering its SUSHI.  I've had far better for a far lower cost.  Don't get me wrong - I won't hesistate to drop a couple of benjamins if the meal is worth it.  But this was NOT worth it.  I find myself hungry after less than 2 hours.  It also took an inordinate amount of time for our food to arrive.  Good thing our watiress was at our table less than a minute after we walked in and took our order quickly.    Speaking of the waitress... while she was very friendly and attentive, she ABSOLUTELY REEKED of some sickly sweet perfurme.  It turned my stomach and quite possibly ruined the meal for me.  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN... if you choose foodservice as a career - which there is NOTHING wrong with - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and do NOT bathe in strong smelling perfumes and colognes.  The stench greatly affects the flavor of the food your PAYING CUSTOMERS eat (yes, the ones who also tip you).  Who knows - the food may have been the best food ever served to mankind... I wouldn't know because all I could taste was the stench of that sickly sweet perfume.    Not going back."}
{"text":"Decided to give Sushi Brokers a try today and was pleasantly surprised. The reviews are right, the sushi is not cheap - $14 for 5 pieces of nagiri, but the quality is impressive. I also got a lunch bento box and did not regret it. Whatever they cook their vegetables in is delicious. The katsu wasn't greasy or soggy. It was scrumptious. I may not run back for their sushi, because I'm cheap, but at $9 their bento boxes are well worth it.  In regards to service, the waitress was very intensive for being the only one in the restaurant. The sushi chef may be a little slow, but if you watched him you'd see how meticulous he is - every brush of the knife was deliberate. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite sushi spot in the valley! You must try the chimichunga roll. I can't wait until they open their Gilbert location!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, especially during happy hour. My favorite is the chimichanga rolls, and I don't even like spicy food typically."}
{"text":"I guess you could say that this place has the worst customer service I have ever seen. I am a server myself and this place was horrible. There were 4 server girls and only three tables in the entire place, but yet not one of them could break away from their conversation to seat us. so we sat ourselves, then once we were sitting, no one came up to us. we were there for 10 mins w/ no service, waters, or hi the entire time. If i was the manager i would fire every last one of those retarted servers. we got up and walked out and will never return again. this would be the second time it a has happened. Maybe the bleach they used on their hair seeped into their brains. Or maybe they tanned so much they are just permanently fried."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi but maybe not worth the price point. We stopped for sushi after a long drive.  Am I glad I ate here? Yes. Would I go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Happy hour is great - a nice selection of food items from which to choose. Definitely try the \"Surfer\" if you like crab and shrimp. (My husband doesn't even like crab and he devours this roll.) It takes awhile for this one so order it VERY early on if you think you want one.  Drink selections are ample on the happy hour menu. Points here!  We've been to Sushi Brokers - I'd venture to say - at least thirty times in the last couple of years and it's pretty reliable on both the food & service. Servers are sweet and hard-working (hey guys - read this as \"hot\"); frankly, I'm impressed with the consistency of good service here.   I enjoy the decor, the lighting - it's a nice atmosphere. They've always got current music playing and they've found the sweet spot on the volume as of late (in the past, it used to get to nightclub dBs and you couldn't hold a conversation.)   PS - Maybe slightly pricey when not happy hour, but hey, \"Welcome to Scottsdale!\"  Other favs: the lollipop, the cowgirl (with the sauce on the side, cuz giddyup!, that be spicy!)"}
{"text":"What a fun place to go to.  We came here on a Thursday night and it was PACKED.  But we were able to get a seat in about 5 minutes.  We were just in time for Happy Hour, which has some good deals.  Food is tasty and the service is good.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Really fresh sushi, even though the people making them aren't japanese...nevertheless, their rolls, nigiri, and sashimi were very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"terrrrible!!!!!!!! negative stars!!!! We got a hair on out good, they brought the same plate back and just took the hair off, I know this because I moved a piece on the plate and  Moved the ginger.... -____- they finally brought it back then we had to wait for forks... She literally took 7 mins, bring ONE fork and said \"I couldn't find another one so let me go look again\" like seriously HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE FORKS!!!! 4 minutes later she brought another one.... It was redic!!! Also when we first got there she passed us several times before even giving me real menu..... Sooooo NEVER GOING BACK!!!"}
{"text":"This place has been my go to for sushi spot in the more central part of Phoenix as of lately. Consistently has good rolls and cocktails. The happy hour is probably the best sushi happy hour around."}
{"text":"Went with the boyfriend this early evening. We went for Happy Hour. It's noisy, and busy, but the staff were plentiful and friendly.   The HH menu of rolls and food was, of course, more limited than their standard menu, but still more varied than most sushi places during HH.  My boyfriend ordered his standard California Roll, and Philly Roll, both of which were decent sized, and only $4.50/ea.  I ordered the Las Vegas roll, which was $8.50, even during HH, which surprised me. Every other place I've been during regular hours the LV roll was around $9, so I didn't feel like I was getting much of a deal there.   I like a lot going on with my sushi. Lots of texture, and complimentary flavors, which is why I usually order a tempura'd roll.  I was surprised to taste the Philly roll and find it really flavorful, with a bit of spice to it that I don't normally encounter. The LV roll was pretty standard for that roll.  Tasted good, but didn't knock my socks off or anything. But, since it's one of my \"old faithful's\", I'd order it again here, just not at the regular price (around $13 when it's not HH).    After that, we were still hungry, so we decided to order 2 more rolls. The Diamondback roll was new to me, and seriously yummy. Definitely a new favorite. HH price was $8.50.  The other roll we ordered wasn't on the HH menu, and was $16.50(!), but it sounded interesting, and when I saw someone else's order of it, it looked amazing, so I splurged and tried it.  It's called the \"Hot Lips\" roll.  It's really spicy, with a lot going on. My boyfriend thought it was a \"once in a while\" roll only because of the spicy kick, but I didn't think it was too hot at all (but, I grew up here, so I'm used to spicier food).  The roll is sliced and laid flat on the plate, and all of the pieces are topped with a mix of krab, jalapeno, and spicy mayo.  AWESOME.    The staff was very friendly. We sat at the bar, so there was always a server around, and none of them hesitated to refill our water glasses when they saw us getting low. We got asked by at least 3 of the staff how our food was, and we just felt really taken care of.   The cost for dinner for edamame, and 5 different rolls (we're water drinkers, so no drink charges) was only $48.  And, bear in mind, yes, it was happy hour, but one of the rolls we ordered was $16.50, so, we thought that was a very decent price for the quantity and quality of the food.   The place was loud, between the music and the customers, so I wouldn't go if you're looking for a nice, quiet dinner, but for a fun night out with good food, I'd recommend it in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Started off great....the hostess was super sweet, but she was the best thing about the service at this place. Our server seemed like she could care less....the only good thing she did was refill my water. Even the guy who brought our food had this careless attitude as well. I'm not looking for super happy in the staff....but a little sense they're actually paying attention and at least a smile would be nice. We didn't even get one of the items we ordered. She read it back to us on our sushi order sheet.....but apparently never rang it in. The food was just ok, but if it weren't on HH prices, would definitely not be worth it. This was our first time....and most likely our last time at this restaurant. I look for both service and food when returning to a place.....especially because there are an abundant amount of options.....and this place falls short on both ends."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely average like gas station sushi nothing good about this place at all asked for a refund on something we didn't like whatsoever and our server had the worst attitude about it won't be coming here again don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Eric was great! Staff was amazing too, environment was awesome! Food just as good! Definitely a revisit!"}
{"text":"I'm not one of those people that knows everything about sushi.  I just know I like it.  I have a hard time ordering, too, because I don't know what everything is.  This is exactly why I like Sushi Brokers. The girl I work with has a sister that works there.  She went yesterday for lunch and brought me back some take-out to save for dinner.  I like that I can customize my order  - wrapped in cucumber instead of rice and extra wasabi, please!  I had the scallop rolls and they were yummy!   Went the next night with Jacqui after the roller derby.  Luckily, we are on the same level with sushi - we both know we like it but aren't as versed as some.  They gave us two menus right away (I only wrote that because of another review that only had one at the table) and explained some of the things on the menu.  The cool thing is that on the back, there's a bigger explanation of each roll.  Our waitress was so-so but warmed up a bit to us as the meal went on. Jacqui and I shared the Cowboy roll (it's a bit spicy!) and the Eel and Cucumber roll.  We each also ordered a snow crab roll.  All were *really* good.  We left stuffed, but not in a way to make you feel like after Thanksgiving dinner.  Just right!   Our food didn't come as quickly as I thought it would, but we weren't getting antsy at the pace.  Of course, good conversation with Jacqui is always a plus! Our water was refilled constantly (YAY!) and the waitress even asked when we got out bill if it was going to be all on one card.  That was cool, since sometimes it's a pain to ask people to split the bill.   I mentioned during our dinner that the music wasn't bothering me *too* much.  Either it was loud enough for me to notice or it was somehow slipping into my subconscious. DEFINITE Scottsdale crowd!  Jacqui asked \"Doesn't if feel like we're not Downtown right now?\"  and I had to totally agree! Oh, and it was so cold in there, we were happy to go outside.  In Phoenix.  In mid-June."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb when it comes to Japanese food! Im 13 and this is the only place I go. It is so good, you can make your custom roll and they will offer to improve it, if you what it spicy, grab some jalaps! If you're eating at any other sushi place, your tastebuds are being disgraced."}
{"text":"Sushi Brokers has always been that go to place, but recently it's been lacking in service, cleanliness. We were disappointed in the sanitation of restrooms, rather disgusting we would say. Absolutely love the surfer, a many more rolls. We hope they clean up there spot so we can look forward to coming back. Good luck!"}
{"text":"high prices trying too hard on rolls...mushy rice as well. techno music is not a great thing(opinion)"}
{"text":"My husband and our neighbors joined us for our first trip to Sushi Brokers last night. We arrived to a short 10 minute wait. We were seated and our serve Kaylee was great. I got a typical beverage of choice, Moscow Mule, and this was my least favorite part of the meal. I would try a different drink next time, but the sushi was phenomenal. There was a mistake in the kitchen, so we received 2 extra Damn Good rolls complimentary! We ordered, spring rolls, edamame, Las Vegas, Damn Good, California, Salmon Sashami and one other roll. All were fabulous, and we will be back soon! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi joint in Phoenix I've found so far. High quality, non-frozen fish, very original specialty rolls, extremely friendly and welcoming staff, excellent service. Divine happy hour. Sit at the sushi bar, make friends with the chef's (especiallu Eddie and Jaime) and if they like you, they'll toss a few free experimental dishes your way. Very pretty servers. Modern decor. Officially my new go-to. Hope this helps. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here tonight after a long hike and we were starving! The server was very attentive and our food came out quickly and was all correct and well made. I had a great craft cocktail. Kids loved the tempura apples for dessert. We would eat here again. Very good rolls!"}
{"text":"Visited on Saturday night. Wasn't terribly busy. Food was top notch!! Sashimi salad was amazing (huge, suggest sharing) the sashimi was fresh and had no fishy taste whatsoever. My husband had the teriyaki chicken and loved it.  The ambiance is nice, although the lighting is a bit sterile. Prices are a little steep but the food is excellent so we didn't mind paying. Service was good as well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Apparently if you have kids, you are not welcome here. No highchairs, no kids menu, nada. Came a few weeks ago with the kids and wasn't too pleasant. Decided to order to go this time but apparently they won't honor the happy hour prices on to go. Thanks for mentioning that on the phone. Last time I'll eat or order from here."}
{"text":"I love when a place takes their reviews to heart.     Hard to find a restaurant that cares about your experience more than these guys"}
{"text":"Tip: They have HH menu here EVERY day from 3:30-6:30!  That's amazing to have HH on the weekends.  Some of the HH deals weren't that great (like only $1 off edamame) but other deals were really good (like $4 off calamari appetizer).  We actually didn't end up ordering off the HH menu and just ordered sashimi salad.  It was $15 but came with a LOT of fish on it, so I felt it was a pretty good value.  It was definitely filling enough for me.  I enjoyed the greens that it was served on and the light salad dressing.  I would order that again!"}
{"text":"It's okay. Not impressed. The shrimp tempura was so delicate, so melt in the mouth, so divine. The calimari was so chewy that it was inedible! Yuck! Potstickers and California roll were adequate. Don't think we will be back.....RA is better."}
{"text":"Just ordered take out from this location, which is usually great. They forgot both of the sauces that go with the roll I ordered- which was the whole reason I ordered the specific roll. I called to explain what happened & the hostess just said sorry, there's nothing we can do. Clearly not concerned with making it right. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and has attentive service staff. However, the food lacks flavor and freshness. We ordered three different options from their lunch menu. Chicken teriyaki bento- although the portion looks big at first appearance, it leaves you hungry. The chicken doesn't really have the sweet teriyaki flavor, it's just swimming in some type of soy sauce broth. The sushi bento came with meager California roll and tiny tuna, salmon, and hamachi. I usually have to cut these in half to fit in my mouth, but here, it fits in one mouth. Also, the fish is cut so thin, you can see the rice through the fish. Then there is bento special which I chose spider roll as the main. The soft shell crab must've been fried the night before. It was soggy and cold in the sushi. The only thing decent here was the miso soup. It had plenty of tofu and seaweed in it but was served lukewarm. It would've been so much better had it been hot. I wouldn't recommend going here unless you're only going for the dark atmosphere and some drinks."}
{"text":"I have been coming here on and off for years. They have excellent specials great wait staff And overall good sushi. They also make a sushi pizza which sound strange but is excellent. If you get the pizza only start off with a half."}
{"text":"I would describe myself as a sashimi/sushi connoisseur. With that in mind, this place is tops. Freshest fish, very creative chefs, reasonable prices. Very fun and relaxing sports bar type environment. Very awesome staff, very friendly and attentive. Chefs honored an off-menu special request with creativity and flair. Our server was Maddy she is terrific, big shout out to her!"}
{"text":"Went to Sushi Brokers for the first time today.  We had some nigiri which was delicious - buttery and fall-apart-in-your-mouth good.  We also split the Del Sol (my favorite roll - it almost has a light dill flavor), Surfer (probably the best quantity for your dollar at the restaurant), and the Chimichanga (too much sauce and too fried for my taste).  Service was quick and friendly, and the food overall was very good.  Prices are a little too high, though, considering the fact that most of the fancy rolls are $15 and you can get equivalent quality at other places for cheaper.  Overall, a fun experience, but there are more inexpensive places in the area that I like just as much."}
{"text":"Sooooo yummy. Everything we ordered was really good. Our family eats sushi all the time and this place was one of the best we had. The waitress was really nice and made great recommendations. Next time we visit Scottsdale we will for sure come back.   Thank you for a good sushi expierence."}
{"text":"Since moving to the Arcadia ish area this was my first time craving sushi and was glad to find this spot about a mile away. I got there after ten so they had reverse happy hour. Wait staff was friendly pretty empty for a Friday night but I'm ok with that. I had the cowboy and the cowgirl rolls. One had spicy tuna and the other yellowfish inside. Both had small strips of tuna on the top with a spicy mayo and sriracha on the top. About 8 bucks a roll. Had a decent menu besides just sushi  just didnt have the stomach to eat anymore."}
{"text":"The servers/bartenders always look like they want to die/are talking shit about management/each other/the weather in front of customers and within ear shot (literally every single time I've been (4-5 times)). The service is mediocre and the sushi is a bit over priced.   However, they have a decent late night happy hour, the sushi quality is decent, I've never gotten sick eating here and it's a convenient location.   Extraordinarily average."}
{"text":"I wandered in here this evening while on vacation with my husband. I had a serious craving for sushi, which can be tricky since I'm pregnant. Luckily, as soon as I walked in the door, a super sweet young lady named Hunter greeted me, and when I told her I would need specific recommendations on menu items I could eat, she jumped right in. She recommendedthe most wonderful crab + shrimp roll, and she even hooked me up with a couple extra sauces to try. I brought my food back to my hotel and literally INHALED it...it was so good! Thanks to Hunter and her compassion on this hungry, pregnant woman, I had the tastiest meal yet of my vacation. Thanks, Hunter!!"}
{"text":"We came in on a Monday at about 2. They were decently busy and our server Lauren, I believe, handled it like a champ. I don't eat sushi and there was plenty of other things for me to choose from. I opted for teriyaki chicken bento box. Rice was a bit undercooked and hard but veggies were great, cucumber salad was great as was the chicken. Friend had a few different rolls and made up her own add ons with no problems. Cheap lunch prices and gooid food. Great service and they have gluten free soy sauce for my friend. Awesome!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places!  The chimichanga roll is outstanding and a must order every time.  All of their beers are 24 ounce and the staff is fantastic.  Great atmosphere to hang out with friends or even take a date to."}
{"text":"Best sushi that I've had in Scottsdale. Very delicious and expertly prepared. Prices are a bit higher than other spots, but the rolls are better and bigger. If you normally order 3-4 rolls elsewhere...2-3 is probably all you need here. So, really not more expensive. Miso was great too!"}
{"text":"Very poor service. Arrived 1pm. Simple order, 3 rolls, 1 nigiri. Nigiri arrived in a reasonable amount of time, 15 minutes later still nothing else despite assurances it would be right out. Obviously screwed up several orders, chefs pissed with waitresses, I think another customer was served our order then discovered it was not what they ordered. We got tired of waiting, ended up walking out."}
{"text":"We have always been huge fans of Sushi Brokers, and have frequented the Scottsdale and Arcadia locations over the past few years. I'd go as far to say it's our favorite sushi restaurant in the valley. We have been to the Gilbert location twice since their recent opening, and unfortunately, I would have to say the experience was only mediocre on both occasions. I would consider myself an easy to please customer and have also spent time in the service industry and therefore, the motivation behind this review is purely the hope that the feedback will help to better the experience moving forward, and certainly not to bash the establishment. My observations were as follows... -The service was a bit...unusual. Very nice/pleasant servers on both occasions, however, let me elaborate on what I mean by unusual...Last night we sat and waited for about 15 mins before our server came to the table and asked if we were ready to order food. This would have been great, except for the fact that he hadn't come to ask if we wanted anything to drink prior to that. Subsequently, our appetizer arrived before our drink order. Perhaps this can be explained by lack of experience? -Speaking of appetizers, the pork gyoza was a bit soft, thick, and chewy/doughy. The flavor was good, but the texture was a bit of a turn off. -Lastly, the surfer roll is my absolute favorite item on the menu. While not cheap, it is one thing I order every time we visit. Unfortunately, last night it was not nearly as appetizing, as it was soaking in a pool of oil on the plate; this was a first in all of our visits to SB's. Unfortunately, there was also what appeared to be a small piece of plastic stuck in the roll which we discovered by biting into it.   I am not one to complain, nor have I ever asked for a discount on a meal, and that hasn't changed despite the above mentioned mishaps. It just seems as though there are still a few kinks to work out, which is to be expected of most new restaurants. We will be back, with hopes for better experiences moving forward!"}
{"text":"I had never eaten here before but pass this restaurant a lot and had always wanted to stop in. I love sushi and I love cocktails and they appeared to have both. A friend of mine recommended that I request Kylie. We did and she was wonderful. Quick, friendly, and super helpful. The food was fresh and delicious and the cocktail (I ordered a martini) hit the spot. Thank you, Kylie! Thanks Sushi Brokers."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I had An awful experience from both staff and owner   I am very healthy and also very aware the healthy sushi is \"wild\" and farmed can be quite dangerous causing health issues  etc. it's common knowledge for those who do their homework. If you don't believe me here is one example of https://www.google.com/amp/s/articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2016/04/30/amp/salmon-fish-farming.aspx  So I am very picky I only eat at sushi bars with wild salmon.   I called sushi brokers about 2 months ago and asked if their salmon Sushi was wild the gal who answered phone said yes! Just to double check I asked her to please confirm with Manager so she put me on hold .. came back and confirmed \"all our Sushi is wild \" so I started eating there frequently after 2 months I asked Waiter to double check again as something felt wrong. Sure enough Manager confirmed it is FARMED and only Tuna wild. Omg beyond furious (and I not only healthy one out there I think amazon just paid 13 billion to buy Whole Foods) So I contacted owner who implied he wanted to take Care of the problem. He then totally blew me off and stopped replying to my texts after his one and only correspondence. It's sad that one needs to post a yelp review now days to get a response as of course one bad yelp review can cost a biz countless lost clients. I have learned the key to biz is to take care of clients quickly regardless who is right or wrong and that's how you build a brand and avoid the online negative reviews as we all know people are human and make mistakes but the key to good biz is how quickly a biz takes care of the issues to make things right    Long story short if you want wild salmon this is not your place and if you have a problem you just heard my experience with how ownership handles things"}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place by accident. After a long night of drinking we were gonna continue but a very long line at the bar prevented us from doing that. So we decided to get some food and call it a night. After trying a couple places and being told they were closed, we kept walking and stumbled into the doors of a bomb sushi joint!!! It was reverse happy hour so I continued drinking. We ordered a potstickers, bowl of noodles with chicken, 4 rolls and a beer and it came out to like 60 bucks! I was totally happy with that price. The food however was like heavenly angels are dancing on your tastebuds! Ive been back a couple times and honestly is now one of my favorite places to eat in downtown gilbert."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go to have a nice quiet drink and amazing food with some close buddies. Had the best bartender who was attentive and lax to be consistent with the chill vibes in the place. A must for sushi lovers and tasty drink enthusiasts alike."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding! My water glass was never under half full...and I drank like a fish! Prices were fair and the food was phenomenal! Try the spicy edamame! So good!"}
{"text":"My wife and I go here any chance we can get.  Great date night place where the service is always good, wait time is not excessive and the drinks are consistently good.  We enjoy their happy hour as well.  Didn't mention the sushi but of course it's GREAT or I wouldn't even write this post!  Prices are good."}
{"text":"Sushi Brokers is across the street from my complex so I tend to go there a lot for take out but it is also a great place to dine in! I love sitting out in their inclosed patio!   The sushi is prepared just right. And you can tell they are using the finest seafood. I can vouch for the spicy tuna roll because this is my favorite roll and Sushi Brokers provides the best tuna for this roll! And the prices are pretty fair. They have some great menu options on the sushi, cooked and raw! And don't forget to try the saki bombers!   On your way out, make sure you also hit up the candy bowl for the hard log shaped candies! Thats always my dessert from there whether I am picking up or dining in! :)"}
{"text":"The food is great but they really need to staff better for lunch, 90 minutes is completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"This place is located in a fairly busy strip mall with ample parking. It does have decent sushi- I like the Las Vegas roll and the Cowgirl.  Service is adequate, although they aren't thrilled to be serving anyone. I have been here for happy hour, but they won't openly tell you that it is happy hour or what the happy hour special is. Otherwise it is fine.  Had to take off a star because the tables are sticky. They appear cleaned off so it might just be the residue from the cleaner, and I guess it helps keep my elbows off the table, but it would be a better experience if my skin did not adhere to the tabletop."}
{"text":"I recommend this restaurant for anyone who's a sushi lover, looking for a great atmosphere, and of course- phenomenal service!!!!!  I am new to the area & I immediately felt welcomed as I walked in. I sat at the bar & had the pleasure to have ERIN as my server.    As a former waitress, I was very pleased with her service & recommendations on the food.   Like I said I'm new to this area so it was easy to order because she took the time to guide me through the menu, the specials, as well as introducing me to some of the friendly staff to add on the warm welcome.   I definitely plan on dining here frequently & will always request for ERIN. She will take care of you 100%."}
{"text":"First off, was here one time on a Friday evening and noticeably, the patrons are not your typical Scottsdale social lite, was more like your Tempe college crowd.  But that's OK, I came for the food!  So this place is not too bad, serves up some great sushi.  It was kind of pricey.  We did have to wait, so I guess it must be good then. Hehehe.  I would say it would be a perfect place to come to watch ball games as they had a decent amount of LCDs around the restaurant.  Great contemporary music playing in the background.  I would come back again for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"I LOVE their sushi here. It is by far the best in town. I'm not kidding, I've tried many sushi places throughout Scottsdale and this is my favorite. From the Chimmy to the Damn Good, they have some of the best specialty rolls. The calamari is amazing. I could go on and on about their food, the point is, it's delicious. It's a laid back type restaurant/bar with good drinks too.  Not to mention the awesome customer service. The past couple times we have gone in we have had McKenna. I can't believe how sweet she is. She is so personable and kind. Honestly, it is the best dining experience ever when she is our waitress.   We go for the happy hour which is like 3-6 or 10-close. I will always recommend Sushi Brokers to all my sushi loving friends!"}
{"text":"Good food great service decent happy hour. Sitting at the bar the guys making sushi very friendly and talkative.  Wait staff both men and women attractive and attentive to all customers.  Substitutions and special orders never an issue"}
{"text":"Yum! My girlfriend brought me here for our ladies night on a Friday evening. It wasn't too busy so we were able to get a table right away. We just missed their Happy Hour specials which was a bummer because they have really some great deals. Next time we'll have to get ourselves together earlier!  Ambience wasn't too fancy but still nice enough. The middle of the restaurant has a sushi bar and there are plenty of booths and tables to seat other customers.   Started with the Tempura Veggies and Crab Rangoon. Crab Rangoon wasn't my favorite because of the consistency or the crab - I prefer the crabmeat filling more creamy than minced. What I loved most were the unique sushi roll combinations. Del Sol and Surfer Roll were both awesome -- just be aware the Surfer Roll takes quite a while to be prepared. Shrimp Tempura Roll was also delicious. All of the rolls tasted very very fresh - not dry like some other local spots. Can't wait to try some of their other unique rolls. And some more appetizers because they look unique and tasty.   Although I'm not a drinker, my friend LOVES their Fuji apple pear sake because it's so fruity and refreshing. Seemed like they had a pretty comprehensive beverage list.   Can't wait to bring my hubby here as it'd be a nice date night spot - especially if you can get out early enough to hit up the Happy Hour specials!"}
{"text":"I've attempted many sushi places in town and hands down this is the best in the valley. Can't go wrong with the Cowboy Roll, Surfer Roll, volcano chicken, calamari, nothing disappoints! Service is great and great happy hour prices."}
{"text":"It's been a couple of years since I've been back but my brother and his wife come here often for their happy hour.  We took my parents here to celebrate my mom's birthday.  Though the food was good, the service was horrible.  The few times we needed our drinks refilled, our server always looked at us as though we were bothering her.  When I ordered a beer for my dad, it was like WHOA, you are sooo inconveniencing me.  When we ordered a 2nd round of sushi and sashimi, it didn't come out until almost 20 minutes later - and it was only PART of our order.  Our server kept telling us, \"it's just so busy.\"  I can understand being busy, but it still shouldn't lack in service.  It shouldn't take more than 20 minutes to get sushi.  And on top of that, just getting part of what you ordered.  It was very clear that she forgot to put in our order.  It would have made me feel better to tell me that she plain out forgot than to lie and say they were so busy.  In the end, she still forgot 1 whole other roll which we told her to cancel.  She was irritated that we wanted to cancel it. - hello we were completely finished with our dinner and the last roll that we ordered at the same time as our other rolls still wasn't out!  We ended up getting the fried banana rolls for my mom and though our server said they'd write happy birthday on the plate, it came out with nothing written on the plate.  Fail.  The fried banana rolls tasted like they were frozen and then microwaved.  The roll wasn't even crunchy.    Good rolls were the Surfer Roll and the Damn Good Roll.  The miso soup was $5.50 a bowl. seriously?  Would I come here again? Probably not."}
{"text":"Sushi was ok. The atmosphere seems nice but the service was not good. We had to keep asking the server for water, she would forget and come back 10 minutes later. It's not my favorite sushi restaurant but definitely not the worst."}
{"text":"I was sleeping on this place for so long and I regret it! Honestly some of the best sushi I've had in a long time. The salmon tasted incredibly fresh. They also had some really creative rolls I haven't seen at other places. So they do both the simple and complex very well. The non-sushi eater in our party was really impressed with their cooked salmon.  Oh and the sushi pizza lived up to the hype. Very rich and filling though, so I always split even the half size.   This place is now at the top of my go-to sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"I LOVE their happy hour and their sushi!  I've never had a bad roll and always leave satisfied!  Try the Sunshine roll on a hot day!  Their sauces are sooooo yummy.  The staff is pretty good too."}
