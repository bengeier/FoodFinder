{"text":"Good food, friendly owner.  2 tables and a bar-counter with a couple chairs,"}
{"text":"A true hidden gem. I have became a regular customer and the experience is great every time. Small place, very clean and with a friendly owner. Kids also love it."}
{"text":"Tasty, inexpensive and close to home - what else one might want from a small Mediterranean eatery?
The place is clean and staff is friendly either."}
{"text":"The food is fine, but the owner is so annoying.

He will keep on talking about varied topics and tries to bully the customers verbally.

Not going there anymore coz the owner is such a trash talker and uninviting. He once fought with a management guy who came there to inspect whether it is suitable to keep sitting area there as he did not have a washroom.

Definitely, avoid the place."}
{"text":"If I reviewed this place the first time I went, I probably would have given it 4 stars. The reason I'm lowering my rating is because I felt that I was given quite a skimpy portion this time around. 
 
Let's start with the service, or lack thereof. The owner of this place doesn't know the first thing about customer service and is quite rudely blunt with customers. I'd be afraid to get on this guys bad side. 

Anyway, the shawarma is half decent albeit a little small. The shawarma plate seems to be a little better portion-wise but nowhere near that offered by Osmow's or Lezzet. I go here out of convenience, but it's not my first choice."}
{"text":"Terrible attitude poor service. Food is alright but stingy on portions. Pita is even charged as an extra. Food is not consistent. Many more better competitors all around town! Avoid this place as so many more are better (lezzett, ozmows, arcadia, list is long)"}
{"text":"Great chicken and falafel wraps. The sandwiches are stuffed with lettuce, sauce, chicken/falafel and we also get potato wedges put inside. Amazing combo and one of the best shawarmas in Mississauga. Location is in the central parkway mall and is a little dingy but hey, good food."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place quite a few times, but never tried it.  I basically thought they can't possibly have good schwarma with the name \"Wrap a Bite\".  I had envisioned non-toasted pitas and general North American wraps.

The one person behind the counter was very friendly and likes to chat. It seems like the people who come here are regulars.  I ordered the chicken shawarma and while I was ordering, a repeat patron advised that I also order the potatoes as \"they are to die for\" and that his kids \"go crazy over them\". 

So of course, I had to order them on the side.  The \"fries\" are not the regular shaped fries, but are more like roasted potatoes.  They were really good. I even had leftovers and the next day they were still good. In fact, they were great! I was too full to enjoy them with the schwarma, but the next day when I ate it while hungry, I really was impressed!

On to the schwarma, I requested extra tabouli and they complied. Not stingy with that. Not sure what they'd do if I asked for extra sauce as some comments here say they're stingy on that. Anyway, when I order schwarma at other places they're stingy or charge for tabouli, so this is a plus for me.  However, I did notice that they're toaster takes quite some time to toast the pita and the pita was not really toasted.

Another plus is that the server stated that the hot sauce is home made. The hot sauce was not too spicy. But I like the idea of home made because there would be less preservatives and artificial flavours (I would assume)

This place is so unassuming, and with the name \"Wrap a Bite\", I would never have thought they'd sell decent schwarma. As I said, I thought this place sold North American wraps. Although the schwarma itself wasn't extraordinary, the potatoes were great and the tabouli isn't extra.

Give them a try!!!"}
{"text":"Recently, I haven't been compelled to write reviews, as things have kind have fallen into a line of mediocrity wherever I went. 

This is definitely not the case for this restaurant. And I attribute this find to pure luck.

When I first came in I had rather low expectations... A rather run down hole in the wall in a ghost town of a mall,  heavily outdated  decor... And a sign boasting you'll become addicted? Needless to say I took this as a challenge to come out a non-addict.

I am happy to announce that I have failed that challenge.

I have been here but 2 times, but each time has left me wanting more. (I write this review as I eat their food...goes to show the tastiness in their food.)

Their chicken platter is bar none, the best in Mississauga...or at least to me. I'm not so much a middle eastern expert as others but I can definitely say I would choose this every time if offered here or osmows, or lazeez.

Being a small mom/pop shop, their service is a little slower, but always done so with best quality. Too many middle eastern franchises have become a automated machine, with 0 effort towards customer service.... And this was a nice change of pace.

As for the food, from what I've had, I'd easily give it a 10/10. The chicken is extremely flavourful. And actually comes straight from the spit! Lots of nice crunchy roasted bits add to the flavours. The Touum(garlic mayo) is easily the best I've ever had. I will make sure to always order extra of this on my food.  The rice was nice and light but still provided good flavours to go along with the chicken. And the salad is awesome as well.

All in all, this is a DEFINITE try. If you're tired of your regular chicken on the walks, and being verbally assaulted while waiting for said dish, give this place a go. Just like the sign, I promise you'll be addicted!"}
{"text":"Wrap A Bite is at Central Parkway Mall facing westward. I believe they only have an outdoor entrance. 

This place is interesting. I ordered a Chicken Shawarma plate and it came out to $10.16. I handed over a $20 and he waived the 16 cents. Great, I don't have to deal with change, and neither does he. 

As I'm eating, the owner gets into a heated discussion with a customer and she just walks out and leaves. He then proceeds to talk about \"bad customers\" to the next customer in line.

My shawarma? It was good. Nothing wrong with it at all. Will I come back? I'm not sure. The food was good, but the atmosphere was a little intimidating. Maybe for takeout."}
{"text":"Delicious! Got the chicken shawarma, tasty, juicy, crunchy pieces of chicken, with veggies and white/hot sauce, all suffer into a pita and toasted to perfection. Good price too!"}
{"text":"I usually come here for a quick bite. Their chicken shawarma's are very good with fresh toppings. The owner asked one day if I would like to buy their potato wedges.. I said sure why not... They were surprisingly  very very  good and if came with a nice garlic sauce on top. I sometimes want to go back just for the wedges ;)"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Good shwarma. Very clean place. Small place with only two tables and few high chairs. But great food!"}
{"text":"Nice, clean place. Kind of hidden in the mall, easy to miss if you are not specifically looking for Mediterranean food.
Mom and pop shop experience, the owner was courteous enough but I understand when other Yelp reviewers say that customer service may not be their forte. 
Good option if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Not Impressed.  Use to come here before and it was really good but now they cheapened out.   I had to order food for my co-workers at work and told them many times EXTRA GARLIC SAUCE ON THE SIDE.  Did they do this simple task? Nope.  Why? Because they're cheap.  Asked for EXTRA HOT SAUCE ON THE SIDE.  Did they do this? Yes, but only gave 3 small hot sauce containers for 10 people....

Also asked if they had beef shawarma they said no lol again why? They said the beef is too expensive?!?! I'm sorry what??? 

Anywaaaays, I got a chicken shawarma plate, like doesn't it usually come in a larger styrofoam with tabbouleh and potatoes and all that?! Did I get that? NOPE.  Why?  Again they are cheap.  I got my food in a small (Small as in Osmow's Chicken on the Rocks small) styrofaom and everything was jam packed....

Wrap a Bite please provide better service and stop being SO DAMN CHEAP.  People are paying for there food so please provide them with the proper orders."}
{"text":"Amazing shawarma! This is the place I go whenever I crave for something hearty, affordable, and fast. So far the best shawarma I have tried in Mississauga. 
The only downside is that they choose to open and close the restaurant according to their mood, so therefore there have been many days that I have gone at a normal time and day, and either they did not open that day or they went off for a long break.
Another thing is that restaurant is really small with only 2 tables and a small bar table, with lack of any attempt to create a presentable ambiance.
I've been there with vegetarians and they say that it's the best falafels they've had, which is because the owner/chef, makes the falafel right then and there.
Great place for a take-out or quick bite, and is a definite recommendation. Just be prepared to have a back-up place in mind as they may not be open and also be prepared to not have a place to sit."}
{"text":"Wow! This place totally surprised me - as other reviews have said, this place is super unsuspecting, as it's in kind of a grungy stripmall and the name alone sounds like it would give you food poisoning, but this place was actually amazing! I was looking for some time to kill before I had to go to an eye appointment, so I decided to walk in here! First off, the guy running it (and I mean running it - I'm pretty sure he does everything on his own!) is super welcoming and friendly. When I first ordered from him, he was doing a bunch of things at once and told me not to worry about paying until after. Then, as he was making it, he asked me if I was vegan or just vegetarian so he'd know which toppings to put on, which is something that no other falafel/shawarma place has ever done for me before! The price was also really good as well This place is small - and I mean small. There's 2 tiny tables which can squish 4 people in each, and then there's a couple of stools against a ledge as well. Also, I noticed it's pretty loud in there - between the sounds of the slicing, chopping, cooking, etc. and the TV (which honestly was a little too loud, but maybe I'm just a 90 year old in a 20 year old's body), it's definitely meant more as a take out place than it is a sit down. The food itself was freaking great! It was a falafel wrap, but there was something else in here that I'd never tasted in a falafel wrap before that made it stand out from other chain places, and even though I was full halfway through eating it, I so badly wanted to keep going! (I ended up packing it up and then eating the rest at home that night, lol) Another thing that was really lovely is that he was super kind to all of the regular people (my guess is that there was some sort of construction site nearby, as it became slightly busy while I was there with 5-6 construction workers) and he knew all of them by name! I'm not in this strip mall too often, but if I was ever back in the area I'd definitely come here."}
