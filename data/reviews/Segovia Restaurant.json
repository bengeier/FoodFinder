{"text":"Definitely worth a visit. We had paella. It was very good. Service was excellent and so was the sangria."}
{"text":"What a great night out. I wasn't sure what to expect from this place, but it turned out great. The best part of the evening was our waiter; he kept everyone who came into the place smiling. The appetizers were great, but the best thing I had that night was the Sangria - delicious. There was also live entertainment which added to all the fun."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I remember when this place use to be a lot smaller (and a lot better) around the corner on Yonge Street. Since moving to their present location, there never seems to be more than a few patrons present when I have been there on the last two occasions.
Despite this the food is very good, although the bill can add up if you start with some tapas and then move on to other entrees.
Good service (at least when the place is near empty) and they have live music at weekends"}
{"text":"Don't blink or you'll miss this place. But once you find it, you're in for a treat! 

The decor is charming and good for a first date or a night out with friends. Food is authentic, albeit a little pricey (and you would need to wait at least 20 mins for a paella so don't come here starving). 

We were a group of 5 so we started with appetizers - steamed mussels, garlic shrimp and deep fried shrimp. All equally delicious (but be warned - appetizers = small servings). 

But the star of the night were definitely the paella. We were told they were good for 2 so they adjusted the serving so that we won't need to fight for food and end our friendship. We had the valenciana and marinera. Personally, I thought they kind of tasted the same - most likely they had the same base - but who cares? They were GOOD. They also cost us something like $50 each so thankfully, they were good.

We ended the meal with a flan (yes, we were hungry) which was disappointing but the entree more than made up for it. Oh and we also had the sangria which was so-so...obviously, not the things people trek here for. 

If you like authentic Spanish food and have a special date coming up, a definite must try! 

PS: When we were there, a big group (I suspect a group of co-workers) look like they had too much too drink and were singing their hearts out. Most annoying. The manager was smart enough to have a word so after a few agonizing minutes they stopped and left."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a recent trip to the T-dot.  Quite an interesting and unique place... had a (loud!) flamenco show on in the restaurant which was entertaining and disruptive at the same time (wouldn't recommend sitting near them if you want to be able to hear your date, for example).

We shared tapa plates for dinner... paella (average); monkfish (really good); squid (good) and a fresh salad (nice), plus some vino tinto for good measure.  Overall the food was decent but not spectacular.

Service was also decent but not spectacular - all the staff seemed a bit downbeat, but they did a perfectly serviceable job (no pun intended).  The only low point was the coffee.  I got an espresso after the meal and it was watery, bitter and with almost no crema - not good, but not a huge problem after a decent meal either.

This place is worth a visit for something different and authentically Spanish (i.e. not 'nueva cocina' or anything like that)... even if it comes close to the edge of touristy theme restaurant territory."}
{"text":"as good as it goes.

a very cozy and friendly family owned restaurant. they even have a dancer and a guitar player performing flamenco after 7:30. food was great, we had paella, garlic shrimp, and steam mussel, all good. I really enjoyed the owner's sense of humor. will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Just west of Yonge street, off Wellesley, literally around the building corner, hides this little gem of a restaurant. Saint Nicholas street, the road on which the restaurant rests looks more like a drive way to the back of the 24 Wellesley Condo it faces. 

After living in the same area for over 16 years, I finally decided to experience Segovia on a Saturday night. We did not make reservations.

I had been reluctant at first reading the reviews. But I have to say my first experience will be a memorable one. There is something about the old style, the Spanish colours that stimulate your palette as soon as you walk in. We were greeted by an older man named \"Victor'. We later found out that this gentleman was one of the partners who own/run the restaurant. He took my coat and lead us to our table.  

The music was vibrant and it was live Spanish style artist (who we believe is Cuban-Montrealer) brought up the intensity of the place. His voice was not just passionate, but soothing and matched the venue & the food.

After some chit chat with Victor, our waitress came to take our order. We already knew we would be ordering the \"Paella Marinara\" as I am not a Chorizo fan. But we asked her to suggest a wine to match the Paella & 2 appetizers. All wines listed are Spanish. She was honest in saying that the cheaper table wine went quite well with the Paella. However, she expressed that the Valdepalacios Crianza (2009) complemented the paella quite well. So we went with that. 

For Appetizers, we agreed to order the Garlic Shrimp and Crab Croquetas. In no time, she brought us some fresh bread and fresh butter, along with our bottle. While she was serving us, I mentioned that it was my beau's birthday. She smiled and greeted him happy birthday. We sampled the red wine for which I thought was light in taste, but delightful.

Victor came back to chat with us while the live music played. It was the perfect setting for an impromptu evening. Our appetizers arrived. \"Garlic shrimp\": full bodied, flavourful, satisfying. \"Crab croquetas\": delicious, melted in your mouth and quite filling. I did not wish to ruin my appetite so only had half of my share and forced my very willing beau to consume the rest. The wine went quite well and if anything, the flavours of the wine began to dance a little, warming up our taste buds.

Before the Paella, our main dish arrived, the performing artist that evening came around to greet the patrons. He asked my beau his name and went on to the next table. Our Paella arrived and it was delicious. Perfectly done, not too dry or watery. It was full of seafood, plump with a slight tang that just made your mouth want more. Unlike some other places I have been to, the salt did not attack your tongue.
 
It was at this point that the Wine truly did its number. The flavours culminated well and if anything, not only did the food bring out the ecstatic light flavours of the wine, but the wine made the paella's flavours explode in your mouth.

We were quite full and contemplating whether dessert should be explored. In this process, the waitress brought out cake for another patron and one for my beau. The performer then began to sing in Spanish the 'happy birthday' song, tying in the names of the Birthday boys in his address. 

The wine, the appetizers, the music, the song, the cake, the ambiance: truly, it all tied in well together. All in all, it was a memorable evening. 

Additional notes: 
-I have heard that it is better to go on Weekends. I suggest going when there is live music/entertainment. 
-Also, they only take Cash or Credit card. They do not have Debit/interact."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible, never coming back. The chef is a pure a*hole food is over priced and the place is full of dust. Must have been good in its hey day but will never return food is dry and overlooked garlic shrimps are tiny and flavourless, and the chef acts like he's some big shot. Save your money, go somewhere else paella for two is 50 and even though the portion size is reasonable I felt like I was eating day old food. Not worth my time or money."}
{"text":"The Good: the food was pretty good. We had the 'paella mixta' and it tasted really nice but definitely not the best I have tasted (but probably shouldn't compare with Madrid and Barcelona). We had the mussels as an appetizer and I must recommend it. They also make a great sangria. Dod not pass up on dessert - their creme brule cheesecake is decadent.

The Bad: it's really noisy with people seated quite close to each other. Also the lack of windows is a little stifling.

The Ugly:  the people next to us were obnoxiously loud and were trying to make out.

Bottomline: would go back just for the food."}
{"text":"Came here with 8 other co-workers for a Holiday Celebration.

The lunch menu is simple ~ $16 for an appetizer and main course. Our group mostly selected the green salad and crab croquettas as a starter. Salad was a bit too salty in the dressing and the croquettas were more like dough balls.

For our main dishes, we had the seafood chicken paella with chorizo, black angus sirloin peppercorn steak, and the fresh grilled salmon. Most comments were positive for the paella - good portion size, lots of toppings, etc. 
My colleagues also enjoyed their salmon. The steak got critiqued for it being a bit too dry.

Overall, our group thought it was OK. I think I would return to try the Sangria, as I hear they have a great summer patio!"}
{"text":"i absolutely love the food in spain

hard to find a good spanish place outside of spain and especially in toronto.  segovia does it right.  the paella is great.  the lamb is really good.

dining room is a little dark but cozy.  good service."}
{"text":"This was or first and last visit to Segovia. 

It seems like it may have once been a happening place, but unfortunately it is apparent that Segovia has fallen on hard times. The knick knacks are dusty, the place was near empty at 8pm on a Saturday, the prices were a few dollars higher than stated on their web site, and the waitstaff was pushy- trying to make us order more food than we needed. 

I would have overlooked all of the above if our food had been sellar, which it just wasn't. Our Sangria was good, but the Paella was rather bland. 

This place made me sad because it has the potential to be such a cool little joint. Where is Gordon Ramsay when you need him?"}
{"text":"We attended last minute on a Saturday night. What struck me as  strange was how bright the atmosphere was, it was too bright to really feel comfortable. The place was also nearly empty, only a few other couples in the place. 

The food was excellent, we both had the fillet and both were cooked exactly as we ordered. What I don't think I can get over the price. $120 plus tip for dinner and 3 drinks. It wasn't terrible but I was expecting less given the casual atmosphere and the neighbourhood. The staff were all very friendly and the live guitarist was a nice touch. (Segovia was a famous Spanish guitarist).

Dim the lights, get a few more people in there and make it about 15% less expensive and it would be a great place to go for an evening out."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a good paella place since I've had paella from Valencia, Spain- the origin of paella. 

Finally got a chance to try Segovia. 

Started with a pitcher of sangria- didn't expect too much as I never really had great sangria in town. What a surprise! It tasted like Spain! Wish we ordered another pitcher :P
 
We had fried squid to share while we were waiting for our paella mixta. It was simply delicious.

Paella was great, just the right amount with plenty of seafood. 

I'd def. go back soon."}
{"text":"Being the daughter of Iberiaphiles who try to cook Portuguese and Spanish dishes all the time, I'm surprised that I've never been here. 

Our server, a native of Salamanca, was probably the highlight of the night. With his uniquely Spanish sense of (dry) humor, we were entertained the entire time here. There was also live Spanish music, which I thought added to the entire experience. When we arrived at 5:30 it was relatively empty, but by the time we left, most tables had patrons occupying it. Segovia is certainly no secret to the foodies of Toronto! 

To start off our meal, we ordered: the Tortilla (Spanish potato omelet); Deep fried squid aka calamari; and the Seafood Soup. You can skip the calamari, but definitely order the other two appetizers. 

If you decide to come here, you absolutely must have the paella. I recommend the Paella Mista as it has heaps of both meat and seafood. The saffron rice is simply delicious. As this dish is so rich, you can feed four people with one order. 

The finale to our meal was the Creme Caramel ... homemade... it was delish! 

Looking for a good time? 
Segovia it."}
{"text":"We stopped by Segovia tonight without reservations and were immediately seated. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the garlic shrimp and the paella tapas with a pitcher of sangria. The tapas were beyond our expectations for quality and size. We were too full to order an entree. The flan was delicious. We definitely will return next time we visit Toronto. Great food, service and environment. Prices are quite reasonable."}
{"text":"AVOID!  If this is what Spanish food is supposed to be, that was my last time trying it. 

Took my family here for Father's Day dinner and the experience was not too pleasant.  We got two paellas and a tapas dish.  We were there at around 7:30pm with reservations but it was not honoured.  We were seated and pretty much every tapas I tried to order, they didn't have it.  When we got the paellas, it was super fishy and not that great.  To put cherry on top on a bad dining experience, we got bill after a forced tip even though our table was only four people.  Also we don't drink and got attitude from the server when we didn't order any alcohol.  I will definitely not be returning to this place and I do not recommend this experience to anyone else here on Yelp.

Food: 1/5, super fishy scent when seafood is not fresh with dried up mussels.

Service: 1/5, reservation not honoured, waiter was never attentive

Ambience: 2/5, not bad of a decor but old seating/table and not ventilated at all

Price: 1/5, it came to around $150 with $17 forced tip for four people.  I don't think this placed deserved that for what it serves."}
{"text":"I was looking for an authentic Spanish restaurant, and stumbled upon Segovia! was so happy to learn that the staff was from SPAIN...Madrid, Asturias, y Santiago de Campostela!! and not from Latin America..

vino tinto...probabaly one of the best Riojas (red wines) ive ever had...Valdes Palacios

the comida (food) we ordered the Paella Marinera (seafood Paella) was so fresh and delicious, though a bit pricey, after all you're paying for quality......and the food speaks for itself. 

I'll be back to test out their paella Valenciana!!!! bien trabaja caballeros!!
nos vemos!!! pronto"}
{"text":"It's my first visit there, but I didn't expect to be there on it's last day opening! I feel bad for such a great restaurant opening for over 16 years going to close because of new condos are going to be built over there. Tasty food, lovely decoration, cozy environment. The whole family are so friendly and hospitable! Gonna miss this place."}
{"text":"I love spending Friday and Saturday evenings here in this hidden gem located tucked away on St. Nicholas st by Rabba store. A violin player plays some classical favourites while we devoured some of the best Spanish tapas in the country! Yes..this is definitely the Spanish restaurant to visit. You may think I am speaking too highly of this place but it's well deserved. I have been here countless times and they are incredibly consistent. My favourites from the tapa menu are their Paella, monk fish, calamari, and mussels. Make sure to enjoy it with a bottle or two or three of their San Miguel beer. 

If you are in the area from Mondays to Fridays, they have lunch specials for $15. 

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Spanish restaurants and Tapas bars are becoming a trendy fad.  This place has been around for awhile and is still elite-level in my opinion.  Great service.  Superb food.  Friendly ownership and management.  And one of the most stunningly beautiful hostesses I've ever seen (I hope that didn't read \"creepy,\" I didn't mean it to).  

Yeah, this place was great Spanish before Spanish was hip-cool.  Love the quail in brandy reduction.  Love the Alioli greens.  Great wine selection - although I usually get simple house red (Penascal) and a Spanish beer.  Nice colorful decor.  

Don't take my word for it.  My friends from Spain rave about it too.  Very authentic and unpretentious."}
{"text":"came here last fall and have been back a bunch of times... the paella is great! they offer 3 types that are meant to be shared between 2 people... theyre all good but the regular \"mixta\" is awesome... theres also good selection of apps... the monkfish was my fav and if youre not in the mood for paella theres lots of other options....

my only caveat is that they have live spanish musicians play during dinner on the weekends... just not my thing... i prefer regular back ground music and dinner conversation... 

ps- awesome for a date!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic Spanish Restaurant, this is a place for you!
Beautiful classy interior design, friendly Spanish staff, low key background music (sometimes they also do Karaoke night which is kind of weird). 
Tip for red wine snobs: Valdes Palacios! Delicious medium bodied Rioja, which is impossible to find in LCBO, so take advantage.
My absolute favourite dish there, the one I will come back for over and over again is their Paella Marinera. To die for! One order serves two. 
Desserts are super yum as well! A must go for Spanish food fans ;)"}
{"text":"So... My parents were visiting from out-of-town and I wanted to take them somewhere authentically spanish.  I should note, both my parents are both from Spain, and had just returned from 3 months in the motherland, so expectations were high!

I also really wanted them to enjoy a slice of Spanish cooking without my mom having to make it herself!  Well, my decision paid off...

-Food... I ordered the salmon for myself.  Not gonna lie it was delicious, grilled, albeit a touch dry.  Served with some tortilla, and seasoned green beans.  My parents split the Paella Marinera for two.  Loaded with seafood, and both my mom and dad expressed how good it was.  Their portion was definitely enough for two, and the waiter, without asking, portioned more for my dad than my mom.  Smart move, my mom is tiny.
We accompanied our meal with an imported San Miguel beer each for my dad and I, and my mom stuck to water.  We also had dessert.  Flan for my folks, and I had the cheesecake.  Everything was fresh and tasty!

-Cost... In total, tax and tip included, the bill came to $139.04.  I felt as though the price was a bit high, especially knowing that in Spain, this meal would've cost me $80 tops!  But I suppose you're paying for the experience, and rarity of having authentic Spanish food in Toronto.

-Service... We had 3 gentlemen taking care of us.  And elderly guy, clearly from Spain, greeted, seated us, and chatted us up the entire evening in our native tongue.  He was very friendly, perhaps overly so as there were times during our meal he'd come over and talk....and talk.....and talk some more. lol But, to his defense, I think he was excited to have some real Spaniards in there.  Not only that, it turns out he and my dad shared an aquaintance....small world.
The second guy waited our table.  I believe his name was Antonio.  Also spanish, and he had the sense of humour and charm to prove it.  My parents adored him, and he kept them entertained.  Turns out he's from a town very close to my parents.  So again... bonus points for him!  He kept my parents laughing through our dinner experience, and was definitely a highlight of our evening.
Third guy just served us our food, and as previously mentioned, he did a great job of portioning my parents split paella.  He was polite and quick.
Only complaint I have about service is that we waited a bit long for our bill.  We were clearly finished as they walked by a few times, but I still had to get up from my seat to ask for our bill.

-Ambiance... Upon walking in I found the decor to be overly done.  Almost like they were trying too hard.  But I get it.  Trying to exude that spanish flair for their canadian clients. The walls and support beams were filled with various bottles and spanish nick-nacks, and they used a lot of yellow and red paint in there!  Silhouette paintings of bullfighting, etc, also graced the entire establishment.  
When we arrived there were only two other couples in the restaurant (5% full).  By the time we left I'd say the place was only 35% full.  Might explain their prices?  Gotta pay the bills somehow!  There was also a fellow playing guitar and singing some traditional music...not flamenco... just spanish music.  Glad he kept the volume down because I wanted to converse with my parents.

Overall our experience was a positive one.  The food and service were great, and my parents were content (insert sigh of relief here).  If you're craving Paella in Toronto, this would definitely be the place to go."}
{"text":"If you like Spanish food, you have to check out this place. Period. Their paella was out of this world. Juicy. Generous amount of seafood. Super friendly service. Authentic atmosphere. This place has it all. I'm definitely coming back here next time I'm craving some seafood paella. Their food is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Ordered the Paella Valenciana and crab croquettes. Both were fine, but thought the rice was not as flavourful as I'd hoped. Sangria was very fruity and nice to have on a warm day.  Overall a good experience, but nothing special. Having gone on a weekday for dinner, it was very quiet, but I can see a stage for live music."}
