{"text":"Pretty decent soul food.   We went on a sunny Saturday afternoon and the place was completely dead. The location is very close to downtown so it's easy to get to. The Polish Boy's aren't bad but they aren't amazing either.   The cakes are really good and the people who work there are really nice."}
{"text":"I was in town with a traveling show and we were so excited to find this restaurant!  Cast and crew ended up going late every night; they got to know us there.  We eat food all over the country and still this place was an amazing find for us.  Even those who were ghetto-phobic became regulars during our one week in town.    The staff were very friendly and the food was amazing.  I especially enjoyed the seafood and mac n cheese! Food takes a while to get to you but hey who cares when it tastes so good.  Just dont order something lame -  a friend of mine ordered pizza or something weird like that and it was horrible.  Stick to the stuff they are good at like fish, shrimp, mac n cheese, greens and other classics.  If I'm ever near Cleveland again, I'd consider going into town just to sink my teeth into Just Like Mom's awesome soul food!  Even the last day of our show after an 18 hour day and a harrowing load-out a few of us took the trek over to the restaurant for one last meal at our favorite restaurant."}
