{"text":"Great pizza and wings! Can't wait to try fried chicken next trip. Heard it rocks
Italian dishes are all very good."}
{"text":"Living in the downtown, but often visiting this place on my way from work.
I can't say anything about pizza from the adjacent pizzeria, BUT: TTP's meatballs&pasta is OUTSTANDING! And it is definitely not overpriced for so good quality food."}
{"text":"BEST fried chicken in the city! I can't believe how amazing it is! Good beer selection and friendly staff! Great place to grab a quick bite or toss of few back with friends!  I've had their pizza too DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"We just recently hosted Senior Night for SJA High School Softball and I would highly recommend for large gatherings or catered events.  Management was super accomidating and helpful.  Servers were great and very attentive, had catered food ready when hungry girls came in right from game.  Along with catered food many people ordered individually off the menu along with drinks and staff was always right on top of it.  I personally recommend meatball and sausage sub both delicious.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Attended a surprise birthday party there last night, one of two parties going on. Just wanted to compliment the servers, they were super attentive, and very polite. met the owner too, we had a great time there. Fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great food and Pizza! Cheap eats and drinks. Good location."}
{"text":"Great food and very a helpful and professional manager at (Gionino's).The bar is a nice neighborhood place to stop in an watch a game on one of their many tv screens."}
{"text":"Extremely bad experience, very poor customer service. I get that it's just a cheap bar but we went there, my sister wanted to order just a simple grilled cheese (easy enough) but there wasn't one on the menu. She still asked thinking, I'm sure they have some bread a cheese, but the waitress refused and was so rude when my sister questioned her that the waitress stormed off yelling \"if you're going to have an attitude them I'm not serving you\". My sister absolutely had no attitude, she was just asking for a grilled cheese. The waitress made a scene and freaked out it was so bizarre. In the end the manager came over, didn't apologize whatsoever, and just said he was taking care of us now. Scared to get a bunch of food with spit in it we paid for our drinks and left. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar, with better than average food for a very expensive place in a strip mall..  Much bigger than most places in the area.  Prices are pretty hard to beat with $1.75 beers when my co-workers and I were there on Wednesday.  Bartenders could afford to step it up a notch, but other than that I was more than happy."}
{"text":"Always a great time with friendly service and great food at bargin prices.  Try their house cheesey bread."}
{"text":"Wings were terrible. They dumped cold sauce on the cooked chicken. Great pizza and beer is very affordable. Great place to watch sports. It's pretty big. Also has pop-a-shot"}
{"text":"Been going here for quite sometime, although the service in lacking at times. The food is very good, for bar food, on Sunday and Mondays they have a strip steak special that is excellent. And reasonably priced."}
{"text":"It looks like a dive in the front but once you walk in, it's a pretty pleasant surprise. I've been back three times and food is pretty good and with beer specials even on weekends, you can't beat it."}
{"text":"I was literally just kicked out of the bar physically for being friends with someone who made a joke that someone else thought was offensive and threatened my friend win violence. The GM supported physical violence if my friend didn't apologize for a harmless verbal joke."}
{"text":"I always have a good time here. Great place for lunch, especially with the daily food specials. Cheap drinks make this a great place to watch all Cleveland sports from the regular season games to the playoffs. 

Friendly staff and management treat their regular customers like family, especially when it comes to removing abusive bigots from the establishment.

I have attended a few events and fundraisers at this bar, and it is a wonderful place to bring the community together.

It is a family friendly place, but leave the kids at home at night, especially on the weekends. Giving a restaurant a bad review because you decided to not hire a babysitter is just plain irresponsible."}
{"text":"Come Away, O Cleveland Child 
To the West Side and the Mild
Where the Buyers Outlet Blooms
And the Bud Light sign looms..."}
{"text":"This is a killer place to come for beers and pizza during a game- or any other time, really. Jamie is a Kickass bartender, and the bar is a good, low key place to hang out. Pizza is killer, cocktails are solid!"}
{"text":"I've been in here a few times with friends and always had a good experience, but they really blew me away with a recent fundraiser we hosted there for a coworker. Everyone we interacted with, from the management to the servers, was incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. On the night of the event all of our 60+ guests were taken care of and staff was checking in regularly to make sure everything was going well. It couldn't have gone better. They even let us interrupt the Cavs game to do our raffle (and on a Friday night during playoffs that's saying something). 

So if you're looking for a place to grab a drink, or if you need a place to host an event, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I chose this place based on reviews. I can't say I loved it. I like a nice cold beer and was disappointed when my glass appeared before me, looking flat and sad. I did enjoy the jukebox. It was quiet, which would've been great for a conversation. When my date arrived, no bartender came back to offer him a drink. I had opened a tab, but we decided to go somewhere else, so we finally snagged someone so I could close it out. Would've loved to have seen a menu also, but overall it just didn't seem like they were interested in serving me. Maybe it was just an off night for the bartender."}
{"text":"Save your money. Greasy, slightly pricy, dive in a bad way grub. And the element is somewhat rowdy/sketchy at times. I also had to haggle about my groupon with them bc they wouldn't honor the terms and wouldn't send a manager to talk to us. Luckily, groupon refunded my money with an additional gift but it was not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Had a great time with my frienda here last week. The pizza and winga are amazing, try the white sauce its to die for."}
{"text":"I like to think of the Third Place as old faithful. It's never too crowded. It isn't a fancy place at all, but the food is good. I never get sick of their pizza. Ever. I have heard people complain about the service, but I have never had any problems. The staff is friendly and always makes sure I have a good time."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The food and drinks were excellent. My friend and I were talking about having a party here and making this place a weekly stop until one of the workers, who I later found out was the manager, inappropriately yelled/screamed at the female bartender in front of the whole place. As a worker in the service industry , I find this treatment towards employees to be an embarrassment to the company and i hope that young lady is okay. No one deserves to be treated like she was."}
{"text":"I hate to be critical of a local West Park business, especially one I patronize on occasion, but I'm a little concerend about kitchen cleanliness in this place. I'm now very wary of ordering food out of this place. When it first opened, I loved the fried chicken. I thought it was unique. I think it can be great again, but they need to bust out the Pinesole and bleach. The staff and management are friendly and engaging, so maybe there's hope."}
{"text":"Great people in the bar but watch the food, especially the to go orders.. I've taken some bad stuff home, like old chicken.. The kids that run the kitchen don't care. I wonder how much food gets put back on a plate after being dropped on the floor back there."}
{"text":"Our server was very nice, but this was hardly a dinner spot. More like, local watering hole that also serves food that I think was just from the Geppetto's in the back parking lot.

The salad was just white iceberg and the pizza was flimsy, soggy, and generic. Husband said his grinder was good.
He tried to order the fries and server said they're just shoestring fries and get cold fast, try the Jojos.
He brought out fries anyway and they were gross even before they got cold. The jojos took forever and we're very dry"}
{"text":"This is a denizen for men.  They need Bar Rescue!

The place is dark and not very inviting. Bar tenders 
are slow to see and wait on you, preferring to serve
the regulars first.  (until you run out of regulars!) The place was not clean.  Dingy.

Our food came out one at a time, at different 
times. Food is not very impressive. 
Service at the tables is lacking. 
I would only eat the pizza here, from Gionino;s. That can
be trusted, and is an excellent pizza from a chain!

Overhaul this joint!  Great location tho."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. It is and has the feel of a local hometown bar. Really laid back. Good music. Friendly bartenders, waitresses and fellow customers. Pool table and other games and gambling options are available. Good pizza and cheap drinks. A fun evening hang out for sure."}
