{"text":"I called them at 9pm and they told me they would deliver, I live less than 3 miles away and an hour went by and still no food showed up. I called them back and they said they couldn't get ahold of their driver, then they told me it would be another 30-40 min, which is what they had originally told me. I could hardly understand the woman and because they still had not yet brought me my food, it was too late to order from anywhere else. Poor business management in general. I will NOT call them again."}
{"text":"Went back after a long absence had the Sun Devil Pork, good but missing  the straw mushrooms, too bad, but still good.  I had an order of crab puffs. Wow! they were always good but his time they were sensational. I took them home and they arrived still piping hot and crispy! I could have eaten another bag full."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews we thought we would give this place a try. As another Yelper put it, the decor is very outdated and the interior is small. The owners are very nice and try to accommodate you if you have a special request. The food is very 'New York' style with spicy brown sauces that were salty as well. Not the healthy new style Chinese food. Most of the food was good. Had Hunan chicken, hot and sour soup, noodle soup, orange chicken, and General Tso's chicken. Very reasonably priced and did fill the belly, so that is good."}
{"text":"I am a 2x a month delivery order who tries different things and I can say I've enjoyed 90% of what I have eaten. My favs are the hot and sour soup, dragon balls, and the house chow mein.  Also portion size is good and they package the delivery order so there is no way it spills or is messy."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Best sun devil chicken there is. Awsome customer service. Place ain't much to look at but then again that's not what i go there for. Reminds me of Chinatown san Francisco . Tried other placesin the area and none can match up."}
{"text":"I've been going to Wing Hing for 10 years and it's still my FAVORITE Chinese restaurant in northwest Phoenix.  The owner, Tam, and her family are gracious hosts and the food is delicious!  It's fast, cheap and the portions are huge.    The lunch combo is the best deal in town.  It's $4.95 and you get wanton chips and dip (sweet & sour and Chinese mustard), soup, rice, wontons, an egg roll and your entree.  Try the Orange Chicken - it is sweet, spicy and crunchy.  I get it each and every time I go.    If you've been searching for a reliable Chinese restaurant in Peoria, Pay Tam a visit at Wing Hing.  You'll never have to search again."}
{"text":"We had carry out and I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and I can't remember what my friend ordered, but when we opened up the cartons, we could not believe how much green bell peppers they used for both dishes.  I am not averse to bell peppers, but this was overkill in a major way. My friend and I set aside most of the peppers, and lo and behold, half the container was gone.  They also chopped the water chestnuts so large that it, too, took up a lot of space in the container.  So what looked like a pretty good portion of food turned out to be not so much."}
{"text":"I cannot believe the amount of food served when ordering the combo meals and eating in.  We also order take out quite often too.  Like others say don't let the exterior fool you, food is very good and plentiful. Eat here when you feel like a casual night out.  Best curry chicken I have had too.  Restaurants have a hard time making good curry chicken sauce but theirs is a winner, warning it is spicy but yummy."}
{"text":"Honestly this is the worst Chinese food I have ever had.  Tonight was the first and last time I order from this place. The crab puffs had a drop of cream cheese in them, the general tso's chicken was sweet and sour chicken with peppers.  The chicken lo mien had no flavor and the water chestnuts tasted like cigarettes. I would never recommend this place to any body."}
{"text":"Looks like a hole in the wall spot but it has great grub. I got the lunch special  of lemon chicken combo that comes with 1 egg roll & brown rice & added  a small drink for $6.50.! Can't beat that price for the quality and quantity of dish. I also spilt a appetizer of potstickes which were scrumptious. The batter if the lemon chicken was mde from scratch. They got the deans award for health inspection from 3 TV News this past week."}
{"text":"A Definate must try! The nice lady always remembers what I order, the \"Shrimp Lo Mein\"  The Egg Flower/drop soup is always fresh as opposed to buffets. What I love the best is the prices. A Friend and I can get stuffed on $20 !"}
{"text":"Stopped into Wing Hing tonight with the family. After sitting there for about 7 minutes Tam came out of the kitchen to greet us and give us menus. We have been coming here for 20+ years and never waited that long so we knew something was off. Another big hint was Tam looked stressed. She is NEVER stressed.... So we knew something was up. After she took our order  we asked her what was wrong. She said they sold the place!! Oh man...we knew we were in for it then... And we were right. She brought us the egg drop soup, sweet and sour, and hot mustard. 25 minutes went by and no 'chips' to dip in the sauces and still no food. During that 25 minutes we didn't even see her 1 time and that is so out of the norm. We waited another 10 minutes and still NEVER saw anyone. For the first time ever, we put $5 on the table....got up and walked out. Such a disappointment to see the quality food and service of Wing Hing gone. We loved the Wing Hing that it use to be. The new owners will definitely not have our business.  Good luck with everything Tam and family as we will definitely miss you and your amazing food!!!!"}
{"text":"I came in at dinnertime with my friends and we ordered take-out. The restaurant was empty except for two other customers. It was a small place. We ordered the house lo-mein and the orange chicken and egg drop soup, they both came with a side of rice and 2 eggrolls. They had considerately packaged our take-out, which was kind. At home we tried the food and were supremely disappointed. The lo-mein was okay, the orange chicken and egg-drop soup was not okay, it was extremely unsatisfactory. The orange chicken was not even crispy, the breading was weird, my friend  proceeded to just take off the coating, it was not flavorful. The eggrolls and crab puff were gross. The rice was gross. The egg drop soup was even weirder. It was the blandest soup I have ever tried. I put soy sauce in the soup to give it some flavor but that did not work out and after awhile it turned into a jello-like consistency, which was disgusting. I lost my appetite after that. This place was a waste of my money, maybe there are better dishes than what we ordered but I would not go here again. The only redeeming quality about this place was the kind people who work here, but most definitely not the food. If your looking for quality Chinese food this is not the place, even Panda Express is better, so don't settle for this place."}
{"text":"Potsitckers would have been great if some werent hard/burned. Great service. Kung pao was sup par, lacked spice and was kind of rubbery. Probably wont be returning,  although I had high hopes for this little joint!"}
{"text":"Using Yelp, I trusted the ratings that customers posted for this restauant and am now enjoying real quality Chinese dishes.  I started with Crab wontons, BBQ Pork Fried Rice, Mongolian Beef and Beef and Broccoli.  All were perfect with extreme freshness and flavor. Tam was very nice to talk to, I told her that Yelp led me to her business. I have found my replacement, no more Panda."}
{"text":"We love this place! Their combos come with SO much food for a small price. They are very quick, even on busy nights. We have only ordered for delivery and the man that delivers is very friendly. It's our go-to for ordering out! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Nondescript hole in the wall chinese food place... BUT everything I have had was good to great.   Fried rice... Good Dumplings... Great Sun Devil Chicken .. Great  Service was good although we have only had take out: BUT the wrap the food in a box so there would be no way of spilling. +1 in my book."}
{"text":"I love this place! So, yeah, its not the most awesome looking place, but the food and service is THE BEST! I am definitely not a Chinese food professional, but I DO know that lady there (Tam) is SOOO nice, and she really cares that you, the customer, enjoys the food.  I just can write on and on about the service, so I hope you check it out and see for yourself.  Oh, and to top it off, the prices are great."}
{"text":"We recently moved into the area and I was looking for some good Chinese food. I thought I'd give this place a try and ordered take-out based on other ppls reviews. When I went to go pick up the food the place was very dingy and dirty looking to me. Had I known the place was going to be this dirty I would never had ordered. But despite this, I thought I'd still give it the benefit of the doubt. I was wrong! So wrong! We ordered orange beef, hot 'n sour soup, and some lo me in. Pretty basic Chinese-American dishes. It was awful. The food was mushy like it had been sitting awhile. It was the worst Chinese food I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"We use to go to Chin Wok. There food was good when it first opened. Now they have cut back on quality and quantity. We discovered Winhhing, there food is very good, the owners are friendly and prices reasonable. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"It's just like any other Chinese place to me. The pork fried rice is ok, like any other place, except there were giant peices of scrambled egg that looked like fried eggs.  The sesame chicken was not good; nothing to write home about.  The potstickers were a bit too greasy. Although you get more meat or whatever is in the inside then at any other place. I think they may deep-fry all their stuff in the same grease because sometimes you could taste a hint of shrimp.  The egg rolls appear to me to be just like spring rolls that you can buy at Costco and over fried.  The deliveryman was very, very nice.  All in all, the food was too salty.  But the place I love the best only does take-out, not delivery. I  will not order from here again."}
{"text":"WOW I'm so glad we found an awesome Chinese food place!!! I was so tired of all the other dirty, slow, bad food places. The food is delicious and they give you a lot! Every time I order I have lunch and a snack for the next day! The prices are really good too. You will not find any other place that offers this amazing food at a great price. Give up your search and step in here or order for pickup/delivery. You won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"I think hole in the wall restaurant is super delicious and prices are unbeatable. I am so glad I got introduced to this place, this food is so good i won't go back to Panda Express because of it. Amazing low prices too!! Don't let the interior fool you it Is pretty outdated but food is of the wall good.. Thank you for a great Chinese meal Wing Hing"}
{"text":"We are on vacation and needed some really good Chinese food . We used Yelp and we were NOT disappointed!  Great food at a great price with huge servings.   We started with the Hot and Sour soup. It was filled with lots of pork and other goodies in a rich broth.  Absolutely delicious!   Our main courses were Mongolian beef and Sun Devil chicken. The chicken was my favorite- lots of slices of chicken breast with bell and jalapeño peppers in a delicate yet spicy sauce. The beef was loaded with tender slices along with onions and scallions in a flavorful brown sauce. Yum!  Complimentary fried won ton strips with sweet and sauce as well as a bowl of hot mustard were provided as we looked over the menu. The owner also brought us two free egg rolls part way through our meal.   The owners are a married couple. We met the wife. She was so nice and welcoming and she was able  to chat with us after we finished.   If we lived here, this would be \"our\" Chinese restaurant.   Don't be fooled by the hole in the wall appearance. Looks can be deceiving!!!"}
{"text":"I've been trying out all of the chinese restaurants in the area and I think I've found my new favorite.  Its right next to Church's chicken and I only found out of it because of the tiny sign out by the road.  This place doesn't look like much from the outside, or from the inside.  I don't think I'd want to sit down here with friends; Its clean but there's always a TV blaring some show or news that would interrupt any conversation.  Take out is probably the way to go.  I've gotten take out from here twice so far.  The menu says specifically that soup is not included with the dinner combos for take out.  Both times I ordered they included the soup anyway.  The soup is very good.  We've tried Chicken Lo Mein, Orange Chicken and Sweet & Sour Pork and all three were great.  They give you plenty of food which is great if you like leftovers.  They're about as fast as any other place, and thier prices are great.  There are a few other places that I dropped in to get menus from and I probably won't even try them after seeing this menu because they cost so much more."}
{"text":"OMG WHERE DO I BEGIN. Their prices are AMAZING, you get a lunch combo with more food than most dinner combos AND soup w/ wontons and eggroll for UNDER 5$ ! The food is quality and always hot, delivery is FAST and FREE! Best family owned place i have ever had the pleasure to eat at. I love the fact ive been ordering there for years and still get the same friendly voice on the phone! Try the Sun Devil Chicken!"}
