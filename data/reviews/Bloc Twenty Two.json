{"text":"What a joke of a business..... I too bought vouchers for this place and I think they went out of business last month.  If you look on commercial real estate listings, the space is currently being advertised and it says it was a restaurant until last month.  Bloc Twenty Two had their official opening on Dec 4 and they closed in February? Seriously???"}
{"text":"Nice. I bought TWO of these vouchers. That's $60 down the tubes....  I'm going to try to get my money back through dealfind.com.  Will update."}
{"text":"Well, you can't say I didn't try. I had a voucher for this place but they require reservations, and they are only open Wednesday to Saturday nights (5 pm - 2 am). I don't know if this business is legit because when I call during business hours, nobody ever picks up the phone AND the voice mailbox is conveniently full, making it impossible for me to request a reservation. What a scam!   This place needs to get their act together soon, because I can't imagine many other people are going to be impressed with this absurd level of incompetency."}
