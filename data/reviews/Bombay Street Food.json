{"text":"Food was Ok. For some reason, the waiters were pretty clueless. If you work nearby, it is a decent place to get a quick lunch."}
{"text":"NEVER will I ever eat here again or let anyone I know eat here .. Stay far away if you care about your health. A friend and I eat here and got food poisoning. We both ordered pav bhaji. The next hour I started to vomit. My friend next day started getting sick as well. Money wasted and got sick .."}
{"text":"Clean, well decorated restaurant. Good for a quick eat if you're in the area. Not worth leaving your neighborhood for.

I was looking for more authentic Indian street food, but what I got was food that was not too flavorful. 

The servers were great and very friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Indian food with a large menu! Nice decor and friendly staff. So many options. Chaat wasn't very good but other than that no complaints about the food. Everything is the right level of spiciness."}
{"text":"I ordered the Salli Chicken Bowl with side of salad. 
PRO: The food came out within 5 minutes of ordering. Very large, preference accommodating menu.
CON: The main dish was luke warm.  You couldn't taste the coconut in the salad dressing which I was looking forward to."}
{"text":"Cool decor.  Friendly service.  I had the chicken frankie with the fries and the mango lassi.  Flavorful but not too spicy.  Prices are a little higher than other Indian places but you get a lot of food for the money."}
{"text":"wonderful experience, a must  whenever I will be visiting  that area. good authentic food, friendly staff, rightly priced."}
{"text":"The portions are huge and the staff is helpful. Never had Indian street food but what I tasted- the Frankie roti was amazing . Also the fries - the spices can get all over your clothing so beware!

Will definitely be back to try a few more things.

Also, fun decor.. particularly for those wary about trying Indian street food."}
{"text":"Since they opened recently, I have been to Bombay Street Food (BSF) four times. BSF brings the cuisine and flavors of traditional Indian comfort food - normally made by the humble, hard working vendors operating their street food carts to feed the millions of people in India. While I haven't experienced authentic street food is India, I was very excited when I first heard about BSF. It is run by two awesome ladies - Seema and Amreen.  

BSF is located in a renovated building where a car dealership was located when I first came to Toronto. The decor of BSF has a subtle Indian vibe with Indian-inspired light fixtures, furniture, and paintings. The interior is airy, spacious and welcoming. 

Now to food and beverages. So far I have sampled several dishes:

The Bombay Sandwich: Had this every time I went there and this is my most favorite dish. It is a griddled sandwich filled with slices of beets, boiled potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, cheese and coriander chutney. The first three times it was served perfectly - nicely grilled with a right amount of vegetables. The fourth time, however, it was a rather disappointment. The sandwich was soggy and didn't include beets (I love beets). The size of the sandwich was also rather small compared to the previous ones.

Salli Chicken: This dish supposed to be spicy sweet and sour Parsi-style chicken curry but I found that to be very average and lack character. It reminded me of any standard chicken curry one would get from an Indian fast food place in a mall.

Eggplant Bhaaji Pav: Pav bhaaji is a fast food dish, consisting of a vegetable dish served with a soft bread roll. I really liked this dish - two crispy eggplant fritters served on top of two warm buttered griddled pav buns with chutney. Fritters were crispy and just right!

Beef Kheema Pav: This pav includes spiced ground beef served on two buttered griddled pav buns. While the flavours were there, I found the beef to be more towards the dry side. 

All their mains come with sides - mixed salad, dhal rice or gunpowder fries. I had all three sides and they are very good. They give generous portions. However, the salad had too much red cabbage for my liking but it is a very refreshing and wholesome salad.

About beverages, I had their masala chai and cardamom coffee. Both are passable but lacked the dominant flavors (i.e., masala and cardamom). 

BSF is located near my home so it has become my go-to place for Indian comfort food. My only hope is that they will maintain the quality and consistency of their dishes."}
{"text":"I went here when they opened and loved the food and the decor. We went yesterday looking for chai, chaat and ice cream and 2/3 were not good. The chaats were good but you can get a better chai - this one tasted like water. The chai ice cream was ok but had a weak chai flavour and the kulfi tastes nothing like kulfi. We ordered the kheema pav and salad which was good and the fish and fries which was also good however fries were cold. This place gets 2 stars for the decor."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because they had a lot of dishes that I love on the menu. Unfortunately, despite the expensive price tag (compared to small portions), this place did not deliver the expected level of taste. If you want authentic Bombay food, keep looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pani Puri (~$8)  Salli Chicken (~$10)  and Masala Chai (~$4)

The Pani Puri hardly had any fillings and were grossly over priced.The puris were crispy but perhaps due to the lack of fillings, it is hard to comment on their taste. 

The Salli Chicken came in a tomato gravy and had a roti with it. There was hardly enough roti for the whole dish but the roti was soft and slightly sweet and I loved it! It went very well with the Salli Chicken where the meat was well cooked and there was a good proportion of meat:gravy. 

The Masala Chai came with 2 biscuits which was nice. However, I had asked the cashier whether the tea was made exclusively with whole milk because I did not want it if it was watery - but despite her confirmation, the tea was watery. It tasted like slightly sweetened spiced water and it didn't have much of a semblance to tea for me. For that reason, I asked for a refund and received it too; so props to them for that!

The decor is beautiful and hip, they have daily specials, and their meat is halal."}
{"text":"Entered here with my better half after a tiring day and hardly any food in belly. We ordered more then we thought we could eat, ended up finishing everything and felt like ordering more. Food was good, sufficient portion and service took some time but the wait was worth it. I'll be visiting back here next time I'm in To, foo shoo."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance, amazing food and equally amazing staff....one of my fav restaurants....who I feel have successfully managed to serve the taste of INDIA. This place actually takes me back home country's experience. Also the owner actually takes efforts to come up and meet us and takes our feedback."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with Bombay Street Food. We went for dinner on a weeknight and the place had a steady flow of customers. 

The restaurant is quite spacious -- one part is pretty dark, but the other areas are well lit and decorated with beautiful tiles. You have to order at the cashier and they will bring your food to you. 

Don't worry if you're not familiar with Indian food -- the cashier did a pretty thorough job of explaining the menu (especially since there aren't many photos). I highly recommend the Pani Puri and the Beef Kheema Pav!

The only downside is that service is a bit slow... it took a while for the food to come out -- but we will nevertheless be back :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Filling, relatively healthy, and worth the price."}
{"text":"It was great to get a taste of Mumbai in toronto! and the mawa cake is amazing ! (as sweet as the owner who was so kind to suggest things to eat !) .. overall a great experience.. look forward to trying vada Pav next time around!"}
{"text":"Not super cheap but the food is tasty. I had a beef burger style sandwich and it was dripping in oils. The gun powder fries are pretty tasty but the fry itself isn't the best I've ever had. I would say for a place that is more cafeteria style, this joint is a bit overpriced but the flavour is strong. The decor is really nice inside and there's lots of room for seating. They take your order and give you a number - Panera Bread style."}
{"text":"Concept - Check. Ambiance - Check. Food Presentation - Check. Service - Mediocre. Price - Pricey. But it's the Food that needs a lot of work. Here's the problem. If you never had good Indian food, this is probably the best place out there that gives a new/western take on street food from Bombay, India. But if you are somewhat familiar with the food you will feel a big let down. There is a difference between the food being spicy and the food having a bit of heat. Spicy = spices, various kinds of them, accentuating the food. Masala is a blend of spices with various ratios of the spices depending on the food it's added to. And in the case of Indian food, it's main identity. Heat = Red Hot Chilies. What the food lacks here is the flavor. I feel with the intention of reducing the heat in the food to cater to a non-Indian audience, the spice component, the flavor, is hugely compromised. When everything checks and the food is presented really well and your expectations rise immensely, you suddenly feel uneasy when the flavor doesn't live up. This definitely needs to be fixed. My friends and I wanted to give them a chance so we tried a variety of items during our visit. Eggplant Bhaaji  Pav, Anda Bhurji with Kheema, Beef Kheema, Gun Powder Fries (lacked seasoning big time), Firni (rice and yougurt desert which was one of my least fav items during the visit) and the Adrack Chai but were quite let down when the flavors didn't match up to what they were supposed to be. The only winners were the Pani Puri and the Cake which we all enjoyed. So advice to management is to NOT don't compromise the flavor or else you guys have done a pretty incredible job with everything else! The prices are on the high side, but the beverages are priced rather unreasonably high. Last but not least is the service. They are friendly but they have no idea about the food, completely alien to it, so it makes it difficult to get any perspective from the hosts/servers. I think if these things (especially the flavor on the food is fixed) this would hit the charts!"}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday evening (around 7:30 pm). Wasn't that packed. Ordered within 5 minutes and then waited for 15-20 minutes for our order  (a pretty long time to wait for some Dahi and Sev Puri). While we were waiting, the owner came by for some ginger chai, which was pretty good. 

We had:
Salli Chicken Bowl ($11.95): not the best; I would give it 1/5. 
Dahi Puri ($7.95): this was very salty; I couldn't have more than one. 
Sev Puri ($7.95): this was pretty good; good balance between salty/sweet. 

Overall, its a good location/atmosphere for a café but the food is lackluster. I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to go here on Thursday afternoon, to have chaat.

Ambience- 4/5. The place was welcoming and it was not too clustered. The decor was decent and had a Desi touch.

Service - 4/5. The staff were friendly and their service was quick.

Food - 4/5. We ordered dahi puri and sev puri for starters. Both the chaats were good and very flavourful. 
Then we had Vada pav with gunpowder fries (the main comes with a veg side item - gunpowder fries, mixed salad or daal chawal rice). I must say, it was really good. The pav was toasted with butter and was spread with tamarind, mint chutney with the vada inside. So with each bite, could taste the buttery, sweet and sour, minty pav with crispy vada. Really liked it!!

Overall, had a wonderful time and would definitely come here again. I do recommend this place if you feel like having chaat, lassi, masala chai !!!"}
{"text":"I've never had Indian food like this. (I've travelled to India as well) Interesting. Terrific. Give it a try. I'll be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Veggie platter was bland, bland, bland. Didn't even bother finishing. Can't help but think it's dumbed down for white Bay Streeters."}
{"text":"Food is okay and the concept looks promising. They need to have a condiment stand so you can spice up the food to your taste."}
{"text":"Aweful is less a word to describe the food out here. Seems like food  was served from freezer to microwave to the table. 
We were a large group and were totally disappointed with this place and would never recommend it to anyone. 
Who could go wrong with mango lassi??? Seriously people!"}
{"text":"Very good food. My friend is Mumbai and he could relate to the food easily. I was little skeptical as being Mumbaikar, he might throw tantrums about the food. But he really loved and I also liked it very much. It would be much better if it was little less spicy."}
{"text":"Bombay Street Food is your modern, hipsters style of Indian food. I ate at the Bay street location.

The atmosphere/decor impressed me with a rustic Indian eatery style. Plates and Glasses were tin and authentic. I felt I was actually on a street side chanty town restaurant, very cool.

The Menu was small with few vegetarian options but oddly a large breakfast menu. All of your classic Indian dishes are here. Some updates and modern twists as well. Check out the Beef Pav, sort of Indian slider made with keema (ground beef). Neat concept.

Some recommendations: 
Lentil and Rice side (daal)
Beef Curry (classic Indian option, but don't expect much sauce, this is a drier curry)
Beef Pav
Mango Lassi - classic sweetened yogurt fruity beverage to chase the spices

The portions were medium. The flavour was present but spices diluted. Because the service was quick, the food was likely prepared well in advance, and it tasted that way.

The service was excellent and the younger staff took pride in the work.

Overall, if you're looking for an authentic Indian style food experience, check out Gerrard Street's Lahore Tikka House, or Curry Twist in the junction. This is a great quick service alternative to the normal food court options found downtown for the 9-5 crowd. But for true Indian sit down food go elsewhere to a tacky and dated Indian restaurant.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is very authentic to the street foods of Bombay. Portions are very generous. Highly recommend the beef kheema pav. Lassi is also very refreshing."}
{"text":"I like this place and the service is pretty good. It's a bit overpriced for Indian \"street food\" especially having travelled in India and seeing how much street food actually costs. But they do a decent job with elevating the dishes and creating a pleasant environment with the decor and little artifacts from Bombay. 

In terms of the actual food, I can't complain. There's some highs but also some lows. 

Here are my top 3 must try's: 
- Kheema Mac and cheese (INCREDIBLE.)
- Saali chicken bowl (comes with NO rice. You have to order separately) 
- tandoori chicken wings (small portion but very tasty) 

I would avoid getting their Fryums or other fried snacks. They're pretty basic and not worth the $10 for 4 pieces. 

Something that's been bothering me about this place is that almost every time I go the menu, pricing and weekly promotions (which no longer exists) changes. I think they're still in the process of figuring out their business approach, but it's very annoying for returning customers to find out that they're now having to pay an extra $5 for a side of rice that used to be included when ordering their curries. The few times I went recently, they also left off a few key ingredients from my Bombay sandwich and also the chaat, so again, I think they're still figuring it out. 

Overall good, would come again for sure. But with a friend or two to grab my top items and maybe a cup of chai. This isn't a place I'd want to bring my Indian parents to - but I also don't think that's the audience Bombay is trying to reach.  

Food: 4/5
Price: 3/5
Service: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 4/5"}
{"text":"This place was had great food, the people were really nice. An authentic decor. However the food was tad bit pricy for the serving size."}
{"text":"First time there, also most likely my last time. Staff where very polite with assisting me on what to order as a first time customer. I order the SALLI CHICKEN BOWL, it was very tasty, but the only thing was it came with 3 small chunks of chicken. I think I paid $14 for the meal."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with friends today. The line was already long before noon. We ordered and then sat down. The place was spacious and decor was nice. 
Food took 25 minutes to come which was a turn off. I had the chicken curry with roti. The curry was just warm (not hot) and the flavour was just basic for Indian food, which generally is very flavourful. The salad on the side which cost extra is definitely not worth it. Tasted and looked like old coleslaw with a bitter aftertaste. Go for the side of rice instead."}
{"text":"This place serves food no where close to authentic  Bombay Street food and also it is not worth it. The staff does not know difference between Indian Pop and Butter milk. I am born and brought up in Bombay and I will recommend all Indians not to visit this place if you want to save your time, money and most importantly save your mood."}
{"text":"Very tasty!! We are visiting from Atlanta and eat Indian at least once a week...this was a quick pick on yelp...and it was truly delicious.  
I had the chicken Frankie roti sandwich...perfection. 
Yum!! 
Husband is vegan...plenty of options there too."}
{"text":"LOVE IT ... LOVE IT ... LOVE IT!!! Everything from the amazing food to the restaurant ambiance. Also, the staff and owners are great hard-working people with fantastic PR skills."}
{"text":"Lovely little place that was nicely decorated. For lunch I ordered the Beef Kheema Pav with fries. It was alright but I wasn't wowed. The beef was tasty and the bun quite good but I was hoping it would be more spicy. The level of spice was not an option when ordering. The portion size was ok for lunch but a little on the expensive side for the amount you get. I would not recommend the fries. It was just regular fries with a sprinkle of seasoning and cilantro - nothing special. But my colleagues who got the rice as a side dish said it was really good. The service was on the slow side but we were a group of six during the lunch rush so that was somewhat understandable. I would go back if they could increase the spiciness of the dishes."}
{"text":"This place has a lot going for it - the food is above average, the decor is awesome and the location is great. We had the Pau Bhaji, gunpowder fries, adrak chai and gulab Jaman soft serve. Everything was good. The Pau Bhaji could have used more buns (the buns are tiny). 

Unfortunately, the service is pretty bad. Where do I start? 
-  if someone orders chai, bring them milk with it. We were told to go the front to get milk. We couldn't find it?
- the gulab jaman soft serve was made in front of us. They weren't fresh gulab jamans!
- don't swear behind the till, that's not good etiquette
- don't wash / gurgle your mouth in front of your customers. Doesn't look sanitary."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  The space is large, open with pics and stories about Bombay Street food. The food is delicious and special. The service is friendly. It's a breath of fresh air in downtown Toronto"}
{"text":"This is not the kind of food you'd get in Bombay.

The items were overpriced considering their portions. Ordered the 'Qubbani ka Meetha' dessert and all I got was a shot glass with some apricots in syrup and a layer of some sort of cream with 2 chocolate biscuits. Ordered the falooda as well and it was nothing like an authentic falooda. It was simply soft-serve vanilla icecream topped with rose syrup and un-cooked vermicelli. Also, the falooda lacked the most basic ingredient,  kulfi icecream!

I'd recommend eating here just for (overpriced, but yum) chaat items."}
{"text":"I have not been to India, but this is probably the next best thing -- a taste of street food from Mumbai (Bombay) in a comfortable and tastefully decorated setting. 

You order at the counter and the food is then brought to your table. We had the Beef Kheema Pav (ground beef on a two buns) and the Eggplant Bhaji Pav (two slices of fried eggplant on two buns). For the sides, we had salad and the Gunpowder Fries (perfectly done, crisp fries with Indian spices). To wash it all down, we had a mango lassi and a regular lassi.

Everything was excellent, but if I had to choose, I'd say that the eggplant and the fries were particularly memorable.

For about $35, we had a delicious taste of Bombay street dining."}
{"text":"This trip was long overdue as had it bookmarked for a while. First the space has an airy inviting feel so kudos on the decor. Now for the main attraction IMO they could use an improvement. 
We had the following
Salli Chicken: Decent and flavored well. The accompanying rice was and bread were both enjoyed by the DC's 
I had the beef curry special and boy it could use an improvement. The seasoning needs to be a bit stronger as it is red meat after all. The potato were not cooked through. The fries were cold and were thankfully replaced did fare a lot better. 
I was told by the DC's that the portions are smaller but I think the place has heard this issue as the serving was a decent size. 
We ordered a potato vada pav just to be safe and boy that was a failure and most of it was left untouched. I enjoy a potato dish but this was neither crispy or well cooked. The side of salad was OK. I think the salli chicken is worth a repeat visit as the other items didn't fare well. With competition that is a lot better for other dishes around the corner even with a much better space they have their work cut out for them. 
2.5 star for the food with a half star bump for ambiance."}
{"text":"Food was flavourful and came really fast during my lunch visit on a weekday. The only thing was the wait in line was super long but after I ordered the food came pretty quick. I think the cashier was having trouble using the system or people were asking too many questions. 

We got the Salli Chicken Bowl, gunpowder fries and pani puri. Everything was good I felt like it could have been a bit hotter temperature wise, otherwise good spot for lunch downtown. Obvious pricey for \"street food\" but it's downtown!"}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0

This is owned by two sister-in-laws who have just opened their first brick and mortar quick serve restaurant after running pop-ups for the past couple years. Their concept is to bring the essence of street food from Mumbai while using primarily local ingredients and only 100% halal meat.

We tried a few dishes from their menu:

Chicken Frankie - This was just alright in terms of flavour but the overall texture of the filling was quite mushy and the layering of roti which held the whole thing together was a little too thick and doughy for me. 

Beef Kheema Pav - Worst dish out of the three we had ordered. Menu did a good job of describing the dish but the end product was fairly disappointing. Ground beef was cold as if it was left sitting out for a while in a large tray prepared ahead of time. The bun was soaked in the grease and butter which made it inedible. 

Salli Chicken Bowl - Best main dish out of the three we had ordered. I liked the combination of textures with the potato sticks and the curried chicken.

Across all dishes, I thought the flavouring was quite mild which is likely more acceptable to the general public. Perhaps I am used to bigger and bolder flavours from South Indian dishes. 

In terms of side dishes, we ordered the following:

Daal Chawal Rice - Not as 'fragrant' as I had expected.

Mixed Salad - Fresh combination of ingredients with a nice crunchy texture but it could definitely use more acidity. 

Gunpowder Fries - Well seasoned and very crispy. These were enjoyable to eat and complimented well with the milder curries.

We also tried the Kesar Crunch soft serve ice cream dessert which was decent. It was not too sweet and had a great combination of saffron, crushed biscuits and pistachio."}
{"text":"The food is delish. I love the buns they use, very nostalgic... grilled buttery perfection. The eggplant is always sweet.

My two complaints are...
1. The heat level varies a lot from order to order. Sometimes it's blow-your-head-off and sometimes it's barely there
2. Now selling the fries on the side is a bit low. I used to go to this place for the value but now it's priced like any other place, so I'm not going out of my way when there are a dozen Indian restaurants between us."}
{"text":"Ambience -- Just wow! The ceiling fans from Cafes in Bombay. The rustic floors, the aluminum trays steel glasses bought back everything from streets of Bombay!! 

Food -- delicious!!!! We had Bombay sandwich, Dahi Puri with side of dal Chawal, Vada Pao with side of gun powder fries. Dal Chawal -- yumm just like my mom cooked back in India :) I never found tasty dal Chawal.. Everything was fresh and tasty!! Mango lassi was yumm -- yes we do not like it too sweet so it was just right :) 

My little boy enjoyed it too!! 

Beautiful owners kept checking that we liked the food!! 

Great job guys, bought back lot of memories from streets of Bombay! My husband grew up in Bombay and he loved the place :)"}
{"text":"A fast-casual restaurant with what seems to be Indian fusion food. I had the chicken Frankie which is a curry chicken roti dish which tasted excellent and was a pretty solid portion. The restaurant is clean and staff were very friendly; the manager came around to all the tables to check how everyone was doing which was nice. The menu could use a little more variety, however, and is at a bit of a high price point for a quick lunch which seems to be it's busy time."}
{"text":"The place is absolutely beautiful and asthetic. The flooring is gorgeous it's hard not to look down. The food however not so much. Alot of their dishes were hit and miss. I noticed I liked alot of their fried things better. Some of the sauces that came with the Puri didn't make the Puri taste any better. They also don't have a spice level, and alot of their stuff is naturally spicy, so make you specify when you order. It's cool that alot of the dishes are hallal and they had a good amount of vege dishes. The service was okay. Some of the cashier's were confused when we split the bill, and wasn't the nicest when we asked for modifications on our food. Overall, 3/5."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Bombay Street Food. It has to be one of my favourite restaurants to have lunch at in Toronto. I highly recommend the Salli Chicken Bowl with a side of rice - to die for deliciousness. The price is surprisingly good as well."}
{"text":"This place is like five minutes from my work and it's one of my go-tos. Great decor, and food is fantastic too. It's like hipster Indian food. I had a burger and fries and it was so bomb. I can't wait to go back and try other stuff. Oh and they have halal options too - so amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is very authentic from the food and atmosphere to the decor.  Great lunch spot with daily features.... And it's halal!  Got the chicken Frankie with gunpowder fries.... Delish and packed a good amount of heat that doesn't come out immediately.  Most menu items are priced $10 and under, very reasonable for what you get.  I'll come again and again.  Great business... Hope the quality keeps up."}
{"text":"I liked it when it first opened but it's very clear they're catering to white people with how watered down their chai and how flavourless their food can be. I understand rent area doesn't come cheap but I shouldn't have to pay $4 for a cup of boiled water with leaves and milk inside it. I'd still recommend it if you're in the area but don't expect much."}
{"text":"Good food. Nothing crazy outstanding. Asked for the rice side and was given fries. 
Party of three... ordered and sat right away at 11:50am on a Monday. Comfy, cute, modern atmosphere. 
Wouldn't come with a large party. 
One friend had the spicy egg dish called anda bhuru with kheema, another had the one that was recommended as \"like a butter chicken\" called salli chicken bowl on the menu and I had the Mumbai veggie pav bhaj.
Overall the guy who had Salli chicken bowl wolfed his down. He didn't like his side rice. The rest was okay.  
Water is provided at stations around the restaurant... the service was meh."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at this recently opened venue, having given it a few months to get established and work their kinks out.
The location is nice, bright, and clean. Authentic use of stainless steel plates and cups adds to its ambience.
The food is a variety of so-called Bombay street food and depending on your taste buds there is variety to please many. I happened to order the Salli  chicken with a side of the gunpowder fries while opting out for their Indian style drinks. 
The food arrived at my table quickly and hot. The fries were lukewarm and lacked any flavour. Where was this gunpowder that I expected? I must've got an old batch because I had the tiny bits of fries you get when u reach the bottom of the bag. Very disappointing.
The Salli chicken was hot and rather soupy in texture lacking flavour other than a strong tomatoe base. While it was a fair serving I felt it lacked a fair amount of chicken pieces given that it was dark meat. The roti was a different twist but was rather thick and lacked flavour.
I saw the two owners milling about behind the counter but they failed to engage their customers. Service is key to getting me back. Had they asked I would've shared my feedback but alas, a missed opportunity for them.
Would I be back? No, not the flavorful Indian taste I'm accustomed to. Too many other options exist including Nandos right next door if you have the need to have spice."}
{"text":"Was a bit underwhelmed after reading all the positive reviews. It's a little overpriced for being labelled \"indian street food\" and the food itself was just okay. I had the chicken frankie and while the roti was really good, everything else was average. Usually with indian food you expect an explosion of flavour from all the spices, but this kind of fell flat. Plus the chicken in the frankie was a little dry.

However, the service was fast and friendly and the restaurant itself was nice and simple on the inside.

Maybe would give it another shot, ordering a different type of dish - like a curry or something next time."}
{"text":"Had chicken Frankie here, didn't even finish it. The curry inside is very spicy, sour and greasy. Also the dressing for the side salad tasted very weird. Maybe that's is how authentic Indian street food taste, but I did have some very great curry from some Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"We have Indian food quite often and were really excited to try this place. We ordered 4 dishes. The chicken Frankie was in no way authentic. The chicken was very dry and the mix of masala was horrible. The masala fish was way over cooked and bland. The pav bhaji was just mush and we make it better at home! The sides, fries, rice and salad... I don't even know what to say... Horrible. We will never eat here again. very disappointed."}
{"text":"Lunch with friend..
very refreshing interior..fast casual style
dine-in customers are given a small tower weight-like thing..
mix of authentic and contemporary
Ordered the chicken frankie..thin naan like bread with chicken curry stuffed inside with salad, along with gunpowder fries!!..best fries eaten ever..curry is flavorful.
serving size is very good..a little pricey for lunch, but very good flavor and serving size. Curry could have used a little more salt (this is coming from someone who usually prefers salt on the lower side)
Host is very hospitable..comes around with tea, served in typical indian street-style glasses
Tea is very flavorful.
Nice selection of entrees. MUST GO!!"}
{"text":"Place is nicely decorated and reflects the idea of the name (rating 5). Food is good but it should indicate how spicy it is beside each dish especially in a place where ppl are not used to eat spicy food (rating 4). Service is very very bad, we cleaned our table and asked for orders multiple times to have, rude and not selling to serve, been here once months ago and it used to be different staff (much better ones) rating 1. The average of place+food+Service is 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"Indian fast food is supposed to be fairly inexpensive. $13 for PAV Bhaji is disappointing, mainly due to misery serving size."}

Price is great for the portion!"}
{"text":"I don't usually give 5 stars to restaurants, but when I do... The place better have stellar food, value, service, and venue! BSF gets 5/5 on most of the above - I was so pleasantly surprised when I came for dinner tonight. No reservations needed when we (party of 3) came at 7PM, but the place did fill up more as the night went on. 

Food- 5/5. Vegetarians, vegans, carnivores, omnivores, people who like flavors in their food - everyone, rejoice! I strongly recommend getting the veggie platter (it's vegan!) if you are looking to sample a bit of everything plant-based on BSF's menu. It comes with a side of choice (I got the BSF salad, which is not boring at all and is topped with plenty of pumpkin seeds, so is filling), dal chawal (basmati rice with coconut and lentil sauce on top), roti (highly recommend! looks to be whole wheat, not buttery or super oily, texture is that of unrisen dough so has that chewiness), and a veggie curry (contains peas, pepper, potatoes, etc - very tolerable level of spiciness). I wouldn't recommend the gunpowder fries as a side since it tasted like regular French fries that are over-salted and slightly spicy. Where was the chutney?

Brunch is also served here, but only on Saturdays and Sundays. Desserts, including Indian ice cream varieties, are also available daily.

Value- 5/5. My veggie (vegan) platter was only $9 pre-tax! And it was a decent portion size, especially for a female. Animal protein tends to be more expensive, but the most expensive main (beef) was still just under $15 pre-tax. The drinks are around $4-5, but looked so cool and the lassi sizes were fairly large, so you are getting the bang for your hard-earned buck. The chaat appetizers are $7.95 pre-tax and probably not enough for a meal, so these might be the least economic options

Service- 3.5/5. As soon as we came in we were greeted warmly by a very pretty Indian (?) lady, who perhaps was one of the managers? She made us feel like we were coming over to a friend's house for dinner. The service at the counter (format here is very simple- pick up a menu, decide, order and pay at the cashier counter, sit and wait for food to be brought over) was a bit slow and choppy. Main con was that food took FOREVER to arrive, so not ideal if you're ever in a rush, i.e. lunch.

Venue- 5/5. Pretty big inside, no seating outside unfortunately. Many bar seats by the huge windows for solo customers. Booth/bigger table seating perfect for group meetups. Towards the back is where the interior design becomes really cool - like some exotic cafe out of a storybook... Instagram-worthy for sure ;)

It's so affordable, tasty, and close to my teaching hospitals and research lab - will be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"We got the dahi puri and the fish for lunch today. it was pretty empty around noon on Monday but by the time we finished eating, the place had started to fill up quite a bit.

The dahi puri was perfectly refreshing for a hot summer day, with its cold yogurt filling. I loved the mix of the crunchy shell with the creamy yogurt, but after twenty minutes the bottom of the shell started to get soggy and leak--so eat quickly.

The fries were very crispy and there was just the right amount of spice in the seasoning. Though the fish was fairly tender, I thought the sauce was a little bland and needed a stronger sauce. Overall, good food for a decent price."}
{"text":"Typical Bombay taste, little expensive for the variety of  food they are offering. Overall I would suggest to try once."}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place, it look really nice, we ordered dahi puri and wooowwwww I got even more excited because it was delicious, then I ordered keema but when I got it, ohh such a disapointment, was soooo bland , no taste, no spice . My friend ordered the bombay sandwich, now that was a bit better, it had more flavor and chillies, thank goodness. After we came out of the place, our clothes were smelling like fried food  and the kitchen is not even open, they need better ventilation.
I think I will only go there if i have an emergency craving for dahi puri, other than that, i rather take the trip to little India for some food."}
{"text":"What a welcome addition to the Bay-College area! This restaurant was really modern and beautiful inside. I had the Salli chicken bowl and side salad. It came with delicious soft roti on the side. The chicken was really moist and the tomato-based curry and potato \"hickory sticks\" it came with were DELICIOUS. The side salad was fine, nothing to write home about (perhaps this was my fault for trying to order the healthy side option, obviously I should have stuck with the fries which my neighbouring diners had and which I enviously drooled over). The owners walked around to check if everyone was enjoying the food, which was a nice touch. I would definitely go back for a quick lunch. Will also have to return for their delicious sounding soft serve sundaes, which feature Indian cookies and crushed pistachios!"}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie platter with salad and gunpowder fries for delivery. They did it vegan for me. The roti and chutney were forgotten but I was so happy to have an alternative to the north Indian restaurant cuisine (ie- not what's served in an Indians' home) that 99% of Indian delivery accounts for. 

Finally some dal fry with mustard seed! Salad was nice with cabbage, carrot, lettuce. Gunpowder spice mix on the fries was authentic. The veg curry was good, but I would omit the corn since I'm not into GMO foods.

And-- this has been not just the only Indian food to not involve plastic and aluminum in delivery, but the only resto to deliver in 100% paper containers!

Here's an Indian restaurant with a unique menu and good food at a reasonable price. If you don't dig on raisins and cashews in your Indian food, kofta, korma and are sick of seeing the same items like bhartha, dal makhani and aloo gobi on the menu, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Last visit was a disaster but its important to improvise, improve and move on. Thats what sums up our experience at Bombay Street Food the second time. I and my were invited by the owners and it was really nice of them. We were surprised to see how our feedback was incorporated and everything was so much better and tasted so good. Be it chicken frankie, veg platter, vada pav or their so different sweet dish (a hyderabadi speciality), yes we tried it all. Thank you so much Amreen and Seema ,we shall remember your hospitality forever and will be back soon. Shivani and Rohan. A must try for everyone who is missing the Bombay ambiance."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a solid 3/5. The main reason is because I didn't think the portion sizes for the price I paid was a good deal. I ordered the pani puri which for whatever reason isn't actually advertised on the menu but they make it anyway, and I got 8 puris for around $9. This is way too expensive for pani puri. I will note that the pani puri was delicious and their coriander water spot on. I also thought service was a bit slow and I had to ask the server to refill their water canister because we wanted to pour some water and while she brought me a glass of water instead, she didn't bring one for my dining companion for some reason and I thought that was kind of rude."}
{"text":"Yay! Good Indian food outside of little india! We had the Dahi puri, the chicken curry type dish, a chicken roti roll and mango lassi! 

The food was like awesome home cooked goodness and so were the owners :) they were all so sweet!"}
{"text":"Lemme just say I was really surprised walking in..the decor is amazing! The lighting, tables, flooring..everything was perfect for photos. They definitely put a lot of thought into the design.

This is another \"fast-casual\" restaurant so you order at the cashier then they will bring the food to your table. 

The food is actually quite good and the price is reasonable. I tried the Sev Puri and Chicken Roti Curry with salad (not sure the exact name). 

Surprisingly...the food isn't really spicy and it's more of a fusion restaurant. I would definitely recommend the Roti Curry dish, it's a good size for one person. The chicken was a little dry, but the chips (like hickory sticks) on top nicely balanced the sauce. 

Sev Puri was something I've never tried before and it was good! Seemed healthy and flavourful. A nice snack to share with others."}
{"text":"Halal meat is served here. Owners are known Muslims. Great place to find some very traditional Indian street foods.  Gives you a taste of \"back home\" cooking.  Tried the rice with daal (very good), the shami kebabs (just OK), the tandoori wings (very good), the beef keema puff (pretty good) and the Qubani ka meetha (very good).  The chai was also very good as well.  The portions are a little on the small side, but I guess they are supposed to be like that since it's \"street food\".  I enjoyed looking at the old pictures of the owner's family on the walls.  Very nicely decorated interiors.  I would come again if i'm ever in the area.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Some coworkers and I decided to go to Bombay Street Food after work. The first thing I noticed was the interior decor and I thought it was definitely unique. The first thing to catch my eye was the sign outlining the rules of the cafe, which I thought was humorous. 

I ordered the Salli Chicken Bowl. The portion size was okay, but the curry was served at a good temperature (for me at least). However, the roti was small relative to the amount of curry being served, and was piping hot. I could barely hold it for more than 2 seconds. I could've also used more chicken than the amount that was served. The food tasted good, but it wasn't mind blowing.

I also ordered a Mango Lassi for a drink. I was told to take one out of this bin that had a layer of ice in it. The drink tasted good and sweet, just like I had hoped, but it was a bit warmer than I had wanted."}
{"text":"We had the Anda Bhurji Keema (with a side of dal chawal) and the Sev Puri. Both were great! We especially liked the keema (which sorta kinda tasted like my grandmas just a teeny bit). Definitely returning to try more items! The breakfast options all look good but next on the list is the Pav Bhaji!

Geethus and Omar signing off."}
{"text":"Our first visit to this restaurant. We ordered three items and they were all very tasty. It was busy and the staff seemed overwhelmed...Service definitely needs to be improved. One of our three dishes was served after we'd completed the first two. The salad that was supposed to be served with one dish was only supplied after we asked for it. All in all it was a good meal at a decent price but look forward to seeing improvements in the service next time."}
{"text":"I've never been to India, so I don't know what authentic Bombay street food tastes like, but now I definitely want to make a trip there if this is what it's like! 

I had the eggplant bhaaji pav. The eggplant fritters were deep fried and super crispy, but surprisingly not greasy. The buns were different from the typical dinner rolls that I'm used to. These were sweet and puffier. The chopped veggies added some freshness to each bite, and the chutney was full of flavour. This is such a great menu item. 

My friends and I split some gunpowder fries. The fries were just as crispy as the eggplant fritters and so good. I was worried these would be too spicy because of the name, but it was spicy as in the herbs and not the heat. Its a unique mix of herbs and spices that I'm not used to, but tastes amazing. It's a good basket of fries. 

Lastly, we also split some dahi puri. These were crispy shells filled with potato and lentils, topped with yogurt and different sauces. Each shell was small enough to fit in your mouth with one bite, so that it's an explosion of flavour."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting and I'm really glad that I did.
The place is very nicely decorated with beautiful furnishing and attention to detail, reminding you of the ambience of a street food venue in India.
The owner came by and welcomed us (party of 8) and offered tea as a welcome drink (free of charge) which was very nice and kind.
I ordered the kheema pav and was very happy with it. Great flavours from the beef. The fries were also a nice touch with the chilli powder. I also ordered a lassi which was quite different from other Indian restaurants, with the addition of a few extra spices.
Overall, a great experience and I would definitely return to try other options on the menu."}
{"text":"Bombay snacks tries hard to craft the illusion that you are in the streets of Bombay, enjoying a meal beside corrugated tin walls while old school fans oscillate overhead. Pick up a menu from the cashier and you can choose from the many bench seating options or quaint patio furniture sets. The menu has many food options not usually seen in typical Indian restaurants, think more street food in tin bowls and not heavy rice dishes with china. Which means soft buttered rolls, finger foods and plenty of flavor. 

I had the Anda Bhurji with Kheema, which came with two soft butter rolls to be eaten with either the small pile of sweetly caramalized Kheema (spiced beef) or the Anda Bhurji (super jalepenoed scrambled eggs). I chose to go with the gunpowder fries as my side, the spice blend used on top of the fries gave the usual side a new level of flavor. The fries were a bit too salty for me, but it did't stop me from polishing the whole little bucket off by myself. I really liked this little adventure to Bombay for some street food, I will definitely be back to try the puris."}
{"text":"There is no reason to give this place less than 4 stars. I had been willing to try this place for a very long time now. Today everyone at my work was craving Indian food so we decided to go to Bombay Street Food though it was quite a walk from our office.
As soon as we entered we noticed that their was a long queue, we waited for about 10 mins before we got to the cashier. They only had one window to place orders and the lady behind it was a little slow, that is the only reason I gave them 4 stars otherwise they deserve 5 stars for their food.
The restaurant is beautiful, spacious and clean. They have a decor inspired by \"Bombay\" as their name suggests.
I ordered Pav Bhaji and it was not what I expected based on my experience with the Indian restaurants in downtown Toronto. It exceeded my expectations, it was exactly what I would get in India or actually I can say may be better than a few places in India.
Bhaji was perfectly spiced and cooked. It was very flavorful. Pav were nice, buttery and crisp.
My colleagues ordered Masala Sandwich, Keema Pav, Shami Kebab with Daal and rice which was their today's daily special. Everything looked great and my colleagues told me that it tasted very good too. 
I feel that though it is a bit far away and despite of the long line ups this place will become one of my favourite lunch spots. Can't wait to come back again and try everything on their menu. Next time I visit them I will definitely try their pani puri."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom nom!

I was finally able to catch them open. I had Dahi Puri and my friend had Bhelpuri. We also had Faluda and the soft Kesar dessert. I loved Faluda. Soft Serve was okay. We also Mango Lassi which was tangy (mangoy) and not too sweet. I liked it very much.

I am glad to have found something so close to me in the middle of Downtown Toronto to satisfy my Indian cravings. They are quite spacious (Bombay Street Food. Not my cravings!)

The wait time today was quite long. They were understaffed. I was ravenous by the time my order came. The owner is very sweet, she explained that they opened in May of this year and are slowly getting over small hiccups. 

The food is really good. I am going back for Fish soon. Will report back.

July 17, 2016

Went back for Lunch. Friend had Dahi Puri (I ate one -Yum again!) and Cutting chai. I got Haddock. It came with a side of Daal chaawal and Gunpowder fries. The Haddock flaked easily but needs more flavour. Daal Chawal was good but again not too spicy. The fries had spicy masala sprinkled on them. (Caution - My friend finds Dahi Puri too spicy, I find it just right.)

October 8, 2016

Had Chicken Salli Bowl. It comes with a Roti and a side. I picked Daal Chawaal for a side. The Salli bowl was good and it is quite a filling meal. THIS dish is a good portion.  My friend had the Vegetarian platter, they asked her which side she wanted, she said Daal Chawaal and they forgot to tell her that was already part of her dish as well. So she got two Daal Chawals!

October 13, 2016

I had the Eggplant dish and my friend (different friend than above) had the Anda Bhurji and Keema (beef). We also gobbled a plate of Dahi Puri. She also had Mango lassi.

Eggplant dish....yummy. Quite fattening I am sure. But Yummy fattening. I ordered a side of Daal Chawal.
Anda or Egg bhurji - Delicious. Beef Keema in the same dish - Bland. (I wonder if they will substitute this for chicken).
Dahi Puri - No other Dahi Puri matches this in flavour.
Mango Lassi - The only Mango Lassi I like in Toronto.

November 22, 2016

I had the Chila for breakfast. It's made from gram flour. It is a small but filling portion. It can also use a little more flavour. The salad that comes with it adds the required tang. Also had cutting chai. Next time I am going to have my favourite Anda bhurji."}
{"text":"Bombay Street Food was a great experience for the family!

First of all, the the ambience is amazing - unlike any Indian food place you will ever visit. Authentic photos, lighting and decorations from Mumbai markets, 

The food is also very authentic. I had Dahi Puris and Masala Haddock, which was broiled haddock filet marinated in a fish masala, topped with tomatoes, cucumber, red onions and coriander. It came with a side of daal chawal (basmati rice topped with aromatic red lentil stew)

The rest of the family had pav bhaji and keema phav which was also very tasteful. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place a solid 3/5. It's good for a quick bite and the atmosphere is super chill. The prices are also very reasonable - but keep in mind you got to be ordering your food up at the counter and grabbing your own water. The servers will deliver the food to you though but don't expect anything extravagant, they simply just place the food on your table and if you're lucky you'll get a smile. 

The food is very average I'd say. I got the fried eggplant dish with fries. The fried were way spicer than expected and I would say I have a dece handle of spice. The eggplant was a little overfried in my opinion which kind of took away the whole taste. My friends got the beef dish, the names are kind of complicated so I forgot a bunch, but those dishes were simply alright as well. 

The location is super prime though, super convenient and easy for a quick bite. The food is a little to the heavy side but that's to be expected when you go for Indian food."}
{"text":"I came in here ready to enjoy a burst of flavours... only to be very disappointed. We ordered both the Salli Chicken Bowl and the Bombay Sandwich with Gunpowder fries as our sides. On the bright side, the prices are fair with a very inviting environment. Just wished the food had more flavour. If you're looking for a quick lunch, by all means."}
{"text":"True taste of Bombay!!! The food is fresh and the ambience reminds me of a south Bombay cafe! #memories
The adrak chai (ginger tea) was alright not exactly what I was expecting
I'd recommend the salli chicken bowl (light chicken gravy garnished with crispy potatoes) or the beef kheema pav (buttery goodness!!!) 
The food is super filling especially if you order the daal chawal rice as a side - Like I always do! 
I always go back to Bombay street food for nostalgic reasons but the food has never disappointed"}
{"text":"Delicious food! 
I had the Sev Puri and Beef Kheema Pav which was amazing alongside, I had the gun powder fries which were phenomenal. 

The décor is lovely as well , you can tell they really put their heart and soul into decorating every inch of this place. The owners were so warm and inviting, truly all the staff members we interacted with were a pleasure. 

I'll definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"Veggie platter is very decent size. Gunpowder fries is very dry. But the ketchup is delicious because there is mixed spices within the ketchup.

Masala shrimp appetizer is extremely salty for some strange reason. There is so much salt that I'm confused on what other flavours that I was suppose to be tasting. 

The interior decor is great. Very eccentric and hip. The service was very quick for a Thursday afternoon at 5pm. 

The menu is designed as newspaper. It's a bit hard to understand due to the mixed font sizes and I just don't know where to focus my eyes. But very cool to look at."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this new restaurant that opened up as the decor was quite nice - cute touches of details on the walls highlighting the origin and inspiration for the food. It seemed to be a family operation. The young lady working at the counter was enthusiastic and cheerful but inexperienced and confused when we asked for her recommendations and in bringing the food to the right table when the food was ready.  We ordered the chicken frankie - this was unfortunately very bland, the haddock - the fish was fresh but again, very bland.  The gunpowder fries were good but the basmati rice side dish was unimpressive (the rice was clumpy and the lentil sauce on top was again, bland). The mango lassi was okay - it just tasted like mango keffir and not the full on mango flavour you usually get at other Indian restaurants.  Perhaps worth trying after they have settled into their new space a little more and let them work out their new opening kinks."}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp's promotional email on new restos in the area. We (wife and I) ordered the Chicken Frankie roll with Gunpowder fries and the Sev Puri. Wanted to get the Potato Pav and the Bombay sandwich but they were out. The roll was very good - I think the taste was like a very legitimate kathi roll that one can expect to eat in India. The spices are on point and very authentic. It was served hot and not soggy. The fries had good spices on them and the sauce was not regular ketchup but a spicy sauce - just how we like it. Sev Puri was also pretty good although it could use a bit more juice. Wanted to try more stuff but baby got cranky, so we wound up quickly. However, the owner stopped by, played with the baby and asked how we liked the place. As we were in a hurry, she still gave us a small cup of the Faluda ice cream to-go and try. Although promotional, I thought was a sweet gesture. Wife loved the ice cream as it was not overly sweet. Price is reasonable too. Definitely coming back here as they are planning to add Pani Puri and Ragda Patty to their menu soon."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed. I went into the restaurant because there was a particular dish that I wanted to eat. I looked at the menu and it had a nice picture of Serv Puri. Then at the bottom it had another item that said Serv Puri with Cheese for the same price. I thought it was the same thing as Serv Puri so I ordered it. I also ordered it to eat in. But the server gave me a to go container with a bunch of stuff in it inside. I showed her the picture on her menu of Serv Puri and she said I ordered the cheese one. If I wanted the Serv Puri I should have ordered the Serv Puri not the Serv Puri with Cheese. Since I made the mistake I could not change the order. I later on google what Serv Puri with cheese and it was exactly what I wanted to order. It was Serv Puri with cheese on it. I feel I was ripped off! The item I ordered was $10 and all I had was a small container with a rice crispy style corn, a few other stuff that is really worth only $1. Also the menu description said that the \"Cheese adds a new texture and unique flavour to our signature BSF sev puri.\" So I really thought it was the same thing. I know I was the one that made the order mistake but usually restaurants are courteous and will make the item you want. Also this restaurant says they serve Street food. Just a heads up...it is not street food prices!!!"}
{"text":"Kheema Pav was damn good. Got it with gunpowder fries, which were 'meh'; it may appeal to a non-desi crowd.

Salli Chicken was too mellow for me. I guess I was expecting it to be done the parsi-way, which is quite bold in flavours. The buttered pav is always welcome.


Dahi Puri - meh; we got little or no tamarind chutney in ours. Plenty of places around Toronto that make this better.

Got a side of Dal-Chaawal, which was quite nice. Dal fry (with tadka) on rice.

A $12 vada pav is something I cannot come to terms with.... yet. That'll have to wait for another day.

The decor has a little bit of a lot of different things going on. It seems to work well for them. I love those swiveling ceiling fans."}
{"text":"Hmmmm sadly this place fell FLAT on the taste totem pole!!! When I walked into this place I wanted to be blown away by the spices, the heat, the aroma... But you know when you're eating something called \"gun powder\" fries and yawning... That it will be down hill from here.. 

So I got carried away before knowing what I was about to taste and ordered the following below...which I know seems a lot for one person and it was...

Mango lassi $4.95
Beef Phav $11.95 with side of gun powdered fries
Sev puri $ 7.95

Soooo all I have to say after eating the above is ... Were you ever disappointed in nutriment in front of you where you were too lazy to get up, get another item, or even more disappointed to ask for a refund... That you found yourself engaged in Boredom Eating.... Well I ate because I was bored of these solids... I wanted to cry on the inside and fly over 7 seas to India so I can apologize to the country of the mockery this place was making of it!!

This place gets a 2 star for the location and the decore... The rest should I say more?!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations when I went into this place as I am from Bombay myself. First impression when I sat down and took a look at the menu was that every item was overpriced by at-least by 25%. There was no-one who came to our table to give me the menu. When I went to the counter to order it took a solid 10-15 min wait and there was this pungent smell around the counter which made me uneasy. 

We started off with a mango lassi which was just something made out of mango yogurt and priced higher. We had 4 similar main course dishes that we had ordered out of which 4 came in 25mins and the other 2 in another 20 mins and as funny as it sounds they all looked different and to add to that the food was bland (lacking salt, spice). The staff seemed uninterested until I went to the counter 3-4 times to ask for some salt, lime, spices. We had order few more items that came later and they were seriously below par as well. The only positive experience came out the Keema Pav which was decent.

This is an expensive place for food thats actually very cheap  to make so they need to seriously maintain their standards and need to train the staff to be in line with the food industry standards."}
{"text":"Maybe its me but I thought the food was ok. Loved the decor. Now I have never lived or been to Mumbai (Bombay) so I have never had authentic street food there so I am only going by what I had today. I had the chicken frankie. It was very saucy and a messy dish. There was no salt in my first bite so I asked for more salt. I should have tried a few more bites as my food as there was salt in the food. The mango lassi was thick and not too sweet. Not too much mango flavour. The fries again had no salt as all the salt was at the bottom. 

I always give a place 3 tries if the first try was ok. So I will go back two more times. I really want to try the chai there. I haven't had good chai in ages."}
{"text":"Ordered food off Foodora. It was the worst $55 ever spent. Had their chicken wrap which came with a couple of pieces of chicken. Very low on flavor and quantity. Tried the vada pav. Bland!!!!!!!! No flavor or taste whatsoever. Their Dal khichi which came as a side was gross! After the meal I was seriously pissed at myself why did I order from here. Will never ever order food here again."}
{"text":"What is it about street food that promises so much ... oomph? Why is it that street food always leaves us with complete abandonment of dining decorum? What if you took street food from one of the biggest Eastern cities in the world, and brought it to a bustling metropolis in the Western hemisphere?

Enter Bombay Street Food Company - a name itself so great that it removes all obscurity and guesswork of what's on tap: pure, unadulterated food from the streets of Mumbai.

And then I discovered, they served frankies.

Bombay Street Food CompanyA little similar to a Kathi Roll (which originated in Calcutta), a Bombay \"Frankie\" can only be described as a burrito-style roll that is packed with Indian flavours. Having not bitten into one for over 20 years, you can imagine my childlike excitement when I realized I could have one in my city. BSFC's Frankie was a little larger, less spicier and the roti a little denser, but the flavours came pretty close to what I was used to growing up. It's a great sandwich roll and large enough to be a meal on its own.

When it came to the Dahi Puris, one of the most popular street side snacks in India, I felt the need to coach my dining partner, Gastroworld, on the proper form of eating one. BSFC's dahi puris were a delicious mix of yoghurt, chutney and potato-lentil, carefully stuffed into the crispy puri ball. Indians will tell you it's all about flexing your jaw muscles - the challenge is to get the entire puri into your mouth without spilling the savoury fillings, in order to experience all the flavours in one bite.

Our second main of the Masala Haddock was a broiled haddock filet marinated in a fish masala, topped with tomatoes, cucumber, red onions and coriander. It was a beautiful dish - both in sight and taste - and the side of chawal (basmati rice topped with aromatic red lentil stew) had us scraping the bowl for more.

Bombay Street Food CompanyAs with any great Indian meal, I topped off my dinner with some chai and biskoot. The dessert came complete with a Bourbon biscuit, and once again, a long-forgotten memory of childhood days vacationing in India came to mind - the times when great granduncles would come visit, never empty-handed, but always with a packet of Bourbon biscuits for us kids.

Bombay Street Food Company is a place with a lot of heart. You can see this not only in the food and homely service, but also in the thought and attention put into the design and decor of the restaurant. The owners have a great story -- sisters-in-law, Seema and Amreen Omar, wanted to showcase the incredible variety and flavours of traditional Indian street food here in Toronto.

Bombay Street Food CompanyTo do this, they traveled throughout Mumbai on an epic journey of research and learning. You'll see photos of their travels, along with family portraits, blended in with the decor. From the wall of corrugated metal sheets, to tableware, lighting and decor elements sourced from Mumbai markets, BSFC is incredibly reminiscent of an India I never fully experienced as a child, but grew to love as an adult.

It's interesting that Bombay Street Food Company's website opens up with the statement, \"Mumbai is the city, Bombay is the emotion\". When you put so much emotion into your food, you're sure to come out with a winning recipe."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and friend for an early dinner and I was really impressed with the ambience, cleanliness and quality of food that we had. 
The staff was extremely friendly and that's what we don't really see in some other places.
Again this is Bombay street food which is very different from the usual Indian restaurants where you expect the usual butter chicken and chicken tikka masala.
If you are from Bombay or have been there, you can relate to the street food. 
Definitely a place I will keep going back to and high recommend atleast a try if you haven't tried Bombay street food before."}
{"text":"We came here on a friday evening in July and I was surprised by how few people were at the shop. Lucky for us though because I hate noisy restaurants and cafes.

Alert! They have the daily specials posted on a big wall (see my pic) kind of away from the ordering counter off to the right. Look out for it.

I was surprised at the amount of seating they had at this location. Everything on the menu is halal.  Lots of different options from appetizers to sliders to curries.

We had the dahi puri for our appetizer. Tasty and authentic Indian street food.  I recommend it. Surprisingly spicy so it may not be for white-folk, unless you can ask them to put less of whatever makes it spicy. 

We ordered the kheema pav, which by North American Standards is like a seasoned ground meat slider.  Extra tasty. I recommend it. 

We also had the salli chicken curry bowl which was like a cross between a curry and a stew. I didn't think it was all that great. I wouldn't recommend it. Again, white folk might like it and think it's flavourful. The amount of roti they give for you to eat this dish is minimal and insufficient and it didnt seem to be restaurant-made.

I had the adrak chai which was almost flavorless and did not taste as it was described in the menu. I wouldn't recommend it.

Overall great shop, great Vibe, friendly helpful staff and some tasty dishes. I would recommend this place.

P.s.  super cheap parking diagonal from the restaurant across from the YWCA, like $1.50 per 30 mins."}
{"text":"I was SUPER excited to go to Bombay Street Food. The ambiance with beautiful decor made me want to stick around all day. All of the details around the room will have you in awe.

We ordered the chaat, chicken frankie, masala chai and qubani ka meetha.

The chaat was pretty OK, needed a kick to it, but that's just in my opinion, spice levels are based on every individuals pallete so im not disappointed about that. The chicken frankie was a bit boring to me. There wasn't enough flavour but there was spice. I didn't like the fact that the spice was so over bearing and you couldn't taste any flavour. The masala chai shouldve been cooked longer I find. I usually dont ever have strong strong chai so that tells you how tastless it was. I've had real qubani ka meetha in Hyderabad and at weddings often so I may be biased but it just tasted nothing like the real deal.

Overall, the ambiance is really nice and would be good to go to with some friends to catch up with a nice little snack and tea."}
{"text":"Nice, cheap place for Indian food. This place is relatively new but it seems to be really popular already. It's a fast food place but they have lots of seating and your food gets delivered to your table. All entrees come with a side (choice of fries, salad and rice). We ordered the salli chicken bowl and beef kheema pav with the fries and rice. Both were pretty good and I really liked the chicken bowl- it was curry chicken with potato sticks on top and rice underneath..interesting. It was a bit too spicy but then again my spice tolerance is pretty awful. The fries that came with it were nice and crispy. I only had a bite of the beef kheema pav but it was ground beef with yogurt sauce on pav buns (so kind of like a slider) which was also tasty.

I wouldn't recommend the sweet lassi though, there was some cardamom mixed in it which didn't go well with the yogurt."}
{"text":"Authentic Bombay fare served in a beautiful restaurant! Portions are huge, food is delicious and tons of vegetarian options. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to check this place out and pretty disappointed when I did.

My Girlfriend had the Chicken Frankie which was pretty dry. She ate half of it and asked me to eat the other half. After a bite, I said \"I love you but I can't.\"
I had the Keema Pav which was also very dry.

Perhaps it was a bad day in the kitchen?

I've visited Bombay on several occasions and I've had the street food there. This is far from authentic and again, I was pretty disappointed. 

The food is presented so well here. I loved that! This place has so much potential and can be so much better. The service was excellent and I truly feel that there is no other South Asian restaurant in Toronto that has such a positive vibe. Hence, the two stars. You have to give the establishment credit for their presentation but I don't know how much that matters if the food isn't amazing.

Names aside, there are quite a few other places in Toronto that do Indian street food much better. Sure, you'll probably have to dry clean your clothes and wash your hair after you spend even a few minutes there but for good food, I think it's worth it once in a while.

I'm not sharing my options here based on the fact that I've spent a good five years (on and off) in Bombay. I understand that the flavours + heat have to cater to a broader audience. I totally get that.

I hope Bombay Street Food brings the authenticity it promises to a good place in the future. I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"All round good food. Would recommend to anyone looking for Indian street food experience. Egg bhurji keema was less than stellar. I would not order again.

Turmeric latte, very good but has LOTS of turmeric, almost too much. I am used to the taste of turmeric, but someone who is not used to the taste or texture should stay away!

Note to management: you may want to town down the amount of turmeric in that drink!"}
{"text":"Great service, very interesting selection, lovely decor, and crazy selection of chai! This is like a low key no nonsense place with good Indian food. The portion for the chicken thing I had with naan is more on the small side so you have to add rice with daal but everything tasted great and still cheap. My vegetarian friend likes the Frankie so try that. I'm going to go back to try their chai selection!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Very authentic. A bit pricey but worth the price. I ordered vada Pav and dal rice. DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"The best Bombay/ Parsi styled food I had in Toronto. Tried Chicken Salli, bhele purity & Gun metal fries. Delectable & authentic flavours.

Highly recommended. 

Will be visiting again to try other stuff."}
{"text":"This place is pretty neat. It's right at Bay and College and across the street from their hated rivals, Colaba Junction. I bet the two staff play against each other in a softball league. Or..idk. Anyway, I tried the vada pav and the classic pav bhaji, and both were quite tasty, and similar enough to what you may find at street vendors in India. Food arrived pretty quickly, and there's a nice charm with the decor in the space. A mix of modern design with old school Indian photos adorning the walls. Overall, not a bad place for lunch or a date."}
