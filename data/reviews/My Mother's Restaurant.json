{"text":"Well I never even realized that they served pizza and from the reviews I wouldn't order that or the pie. I've had the pot roast and turkey and roasted chicken and it good and the portions are big. The salad bar is OK but they need to allow a second trip or get bigger plates because it's  just a saucer!  Too small for anything!  The bread and honey butter is good. They are over priced and the decor needs to be redone. I'm not sure why I go back because I always feel I've spent to much. Well tried to go in tonight at nine the sign says that they are open till ten the open sign was on and the bitch couldn't run fast enough to turn off the sign so screw them I changed the score to a 1 and went Dennys! :they gave me a five star turkey dinner"}
{"text":"THE BEST PIE!  (But the food is just ok)  To enjoy a slice of their chocolate peanut butter pie is an absolute MUST!  The slices are huge, and they are so rich and delicious.  The other varieties of pie are good as well, but the chocolate peanut butter cannot be beat.  With that said, the food is just ok... or slightly worse.  I've eaten their twice and only go back for dessert now.  The salad bar is nice and the service is above-average.  Whatever you do, DO NOT GET GRAVY!  It is like some nasty, brown jello.  Wait, did I mention how delicious the chocolate peanut butter pie is???"}
{"text":"My father has been taking me to My Mother's since I was a little girl, and it's still my favorite restaurant. Growing up with very little, My Mother's was a special treat for my dad and me. Back then, this was the fancy place to eat. Some of my fondest childhood memories were in this little hole-in-the-wall. We had a tradition of ordering the large prime rib - something I still do to this day.   I've been to just about every steakhouse in town, and My Mother's prime rib is still the best - hands down. Their complimentary bread rolls are practically addictive, and the salad bar is loaded with fresh veggies and homemade dressings. Everything on their menu is perfect and reminiscent of what \"Grandma's Cooking\" was like as a child. And... don't even get me started on their homemade pies that put Marie Calendar's to shame.  The atmosphere is very Country and comfortable. It's not modern and fancy, but that's part of what makes this place so special. If you haven't tried My Mothers, you don't know what you're missing."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been coming here with my family for years and we eat there at least once a week. My favorites are the spaghetti and meatballs or any of the 50's diner type meals. The chicken fried steak is huge and so tender you don't need a knife to cut it. I always get mine with mashed potatoes. I get the excellent brown gravy on the potatoes and country gravy on thr steak. Everything they do is homemade. The country gravy has bacon in it and the brown gravy tastes like their tender, juicy roast beef. You can also get a Midwestern classic called an open face roast beef or turkey sandwich. It's just meat, mashed potatoes, gravy and bread they make themselves. It's the ultimate comfort food.  The waitstaff has all been there for years and they know all the regulars. Our family favorite waitress is Teresa. She's fast, friendly and remembers what we drink and what we order.  Every dinner, the table gets a loaf of fresh baked sliced bread. I recommend asking for honey butter with it. If you get the salad bar, try the blue cheese dressing. It's not the watered down bottled stuff, it's the good stuff with actual cheese chunks in it.  The decor is half old school family Italian restaurant, half 70's diner. There's a grape arbor with fake plastic grapes in the main dining room and a vintage Pac-Man game in the lobby. For me, it's like a second home. I'm just comfortable whenever I go there."}
{"text":"The food here is always amazing! The meat loaf is my personal favorite! Whenever we order (usually delivery) the delivery man is always very respectful and the delivery is always always delivered within a reasonable time. I would recommend this restaurant to all of my friends and family!"}
{"text":"My top 3 restaurants of all time. My entire family of 5 can eat here and everyone finds something they want on the menu. My fav is the meatloaf, chicken fried steak and chicken pot pie. Dessert is a must. Any of the pies are amazing. Oh and dos I mention how affordable this place is??!! Crazy considering it's all homemade and delicious. We love buying the homemade bread for $1.99 to take home"}
{"text":"I've eaten suicide chicken wings from this place for the last 20 years. I haven't had anything else from them. But the chicken wings are decent. They're real chicken. They can be hit Or miss. Sometimes the chicken wings are super dried and over fried. And other times chicken wings are juicy & plump. But all in all their suicide sauce is on point and the ranch is homemade. The price is great."}
{"text":"mothers gets bonus points for delivery. nothing like having home cooking delivered to your home.  All the staple foods are good.  the chicken dinner the turkey. the sandwiches are also good.  Like the pies as well.  I did order a pizza once and it was not that great. but its not their specialty.  that is the only thing i really didnt like. if you stick with the staple items you cant go wrong.  one thing i dont understand...why no breakfast? i would love a roast turkey omelette. i would think this place would be packed for breakfast."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to me. It's a hidden gem! Very \"old school\". Makes you feel like you are in a small country town. Food is served in big portions! Expect to have leftovers. They don't skimp on the fat, so it's very indulgent and home style. I love that they serve turkey dinners year round. It comes with stuffing and cranberry sauce, and you pick the two other sides. I recommend the mashed potatoes and green beans. The gravy is not very flavorful. They also have a bar, with beer wine and cocktails. Check it out when you are in the mood for some hole in the wall, mom and pop comfort food."}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant several chances. Each time, they failed miserably. The last straw was when they sent me some cold, chopped up bananas on a stale pie crust and tried to pass it off as banana CREAM pie! WTF?!"}
{"text":"We just ordered the turkey dinners and it has to be the best I've had in a long time. The dressing is so good. If I had to complain, the cranberry from a can took it down a bit but nobody probably gets it anyway. Thanks for another great My Mother's experience."}
{"text":"I only go to My Mother's for lunch because it's not too far from work, but I've been going here for about 12 years. The building they are located in is crappy, but the food is great. Nine times out of ten I'll get the open faced turkey sandwich, which is made with REAL home cooked turkey, not processed meat, with real mashed potato's and cranberry sauce. Excellent! Friends also recommend the steak sandwich, which you have to ask for. It's not on the menu, but they are more than happy to make it for you. If you want to impress your friends, park in back and take them in through the service entry doors, and on into the restaurant. It's kind of like Durant's, without the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Mother's for years. Food is so good and the consistency is perfect. Lately the service has been declining and every time I come here it's a nightmare! The waitresses are irritated by the simplest requests and don't smile. I've been reduced to doing take out and then wait 20 minutes for $14 cold prime rib! I think they have lost a lifelong customer!"}
{"text":"Turkey pot pie is my fave-do delivery every time, always fast and food is always yummy."}
{"text":"My Mother's is my favorite place to get homemade food just like mom makes. The fresh carved roasted turkey with gravy and REAL mashed potatoes is the bet.   And Phoenix magazine just recognized them as one of the best turkey dishes in the valley!  http://www.phoenixmag.com/food-reviews/75-best-dishes-in-the-valley.html  If we save room the homemade pie is to die for!"}
{"text":"This is my husband's and my go to place for pie...I'm eager to go for a meal one day, but for now, I'm thrilled that when I feel like having a pie, it's always there. Oh, the pieces of pie are enormous--way more than one person can eat, so take it home for later! ;)"}
{"text":"Wow! Don't let the exterior and location of this place fool you. The food is great! I had the turkey dinner which is big enough for two people. The owner was also very sweet and even have me a big huge piece of strawberry pie which was equally amazing."}
{"text":"We went back yesterday for their Prime Rib dinner and I must say it is one of the best Prime Ribs I've had in this city and I've eaten it in some of the best steak houses in the city. Again the sides of mashed potatoes, green beans and soup were perfect. My only \"gripe\" is the pie crust was too thick. The cherry filling was on the mark. Service could not be better. We have found a place where it seems that everything on the menu is made with care along with correct cooking technique. If you love old fashioned home made cooking you will not be disappointed in Mother's. Area leaves something to be desired, but I have found over and over that places in poorer areas care more about their food than their location. Inside however, the booths are comfortable and the ambiance is fine."}
{"text":"I get lazy and like home delivery. I don't know of any other restaurant in my area where I can get full meals plus pie delivered. We have patronized My Mother's for years.  My friend loves their grilled fish. Another friend remarked \"Man, these people know how to cook!\" Yet another friend loves their pumpkin pie. My favorite is the turkey dinner and banana cream pie. As far as I know this place is a  Mom and Pop business which I like to support."}
{"text":"Great home cooking , Turkey Pot Pie is amazing. Great service & reasonable prices ! I will recommend  it to my friends."}
{"text":"Been eyeballing this lil place everytime a pass by. Who doesn't love home cooked comfort meals?? Finally I decided to give it a shot. Only thing not on thus menu is mac n cheese...which seemed strange cause that's the epitome of comfort! Nonetheless, I had the prime rib. It was tender, soft and made to order. My kids enjoyed their meals too.  Don't judge a book by its cover,  cause you'll pass up this lil gem."}
{"text":"A pretty good place to eat. I had the turkey, which was surprisingly moist and tender. I'm not wild about the glasses they serve beverages in, or the decor of the place in general, but the food was above average. The gravy was rather 'meh', and tasted as if it had been  a store brand purchased at a discount market down the road. The only genuine disappointment is something I can't hold againt My Mother's restaurant: the rolls. Dinner rolls in places like this usually taste like rubbish, and unfortunately this was no exception. Everything else was spot-on, though. I enjoyed myself, and plan on eating there again."}
{"text":"Honestly, some of the best food I ever ate!!!  I got the pot pie and followed it up with huge piece chocolate peanut butter pie. You can't go wrong here if you love some good ol' home cooking."}
{"text":"The first time we had My Mother's Restaurant was months ago. My husband and I were feeling homesick, and being from Illinois we got excited when we saw that My Mother's Restaurant had deep dish \"Chicago Style.\" It was such a lie and a huge let down. The pizza was not deep dish,  it was not \"Chicago Style,\" rather it was thick crust. It was so thick that we could not taste the topping, just the crust.  --------------------- Last night we decided to give this place another try since our favorite pizza restaurant was closed. After being on hold for almost 10 minutes right off the get go (which was no big deal since they were busy), my husband finally got to talk to someone. He had to repeat the pizza topping order twice, and the buffalo wings four times. They told us 35-45 mins since they were busy.   When the delivery finally came, we were starving and I was really looking forward to their wings (I had been craving buffalo wings for weeks now).  The pizza was okay, the topping were correct but the dough was a little on the dry side. Now for the wings I had been craving, that came with a side of ranch and celery. They sent us the wrong one. They sent BBQ, and not the buffalo that we wanted, even after my husband repeated himself four times.   I've heard that their other food is great but after last night's dinner being such a failure, we will never be ordering from this restaurant again. We've been disappointed with them twice now.   We like to support local restaurants, we won't be supporting this one."}
{"text":"Nostalgic visit - had eaten here back in the 90's. Dinner - I ordered sea bass and I thought, green beans and seasoned fries, but when the food came - there was a combo of mashed potatoes with brown gravy, and seasoned fries. Can I just tell you - heaven. I ate it all, along with a digestive enzyme - and I'm still thinking about it. The place is like an old fashioned, small town place, and the food and cocktails were all good - don't expect anything fancy."}
{"text":"Been coming here for the past 20 years and have never had a bad meal! From the Prime Rib to the pizzas, to the extremely fresh salad bar to the warm bread served at your table no matter if it's lunch or dinner, you get the delicious homemade bread! Employees are all so friendly and walking into this place is trust like \"walking into your Mothers house to eat dinner\"!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at my mothers, no not talking bout my moms place, ha had a sandwich with mac salad. It was okay, have had better sandwiches elsewhere, my homie had some chicken wings, they looked and smelled yummy. Saw the ladies across the way order spaghetti, definitely on my to order list when I make it back to mothers."}
{"text":"We ate at My Mother's Restaurant for the first time last night.  It was so good.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs with clam chowder.  My husband had the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and green beans and the salad bar.  My stepdaughter had the bar b que ribs.  We all got pie to go.  The crust was thick but very good.  We will definitely go back.  Can't  wait."}
{"text":"The chicken fried chicken is great and so is the open faced turkey sandwich. They give large portions, and the ranch at the salad bar is one of the best I've tasted... I specifically come back for the open face turkey, chicken fried chicken, and ranch at the salad bar..."}
{"text":"This place is great. We almost always go there for Thanksgiving. You can order a la carte exactly what you want and prices are great and food is good. Love the Greek salad we had last time I went."}
{"text":"My Mother's Restaurant.  If you want amazing food, attentive customer service, and old time ambiance, this is the place to be.  From pot roast to lasagna to prime rib, every dish is fantastic.  Whenever my husband and I go here, he likes to order the big grandfather's cut of prime rib.  Grilled.  It's delicious and filling.   Don't forget to buy a pie or freshly baked bread,  to take home.   When we lived in the delivery area, My Mother's Restaurant was our weekly take out meal.  How many places do you know where you can have pizza and prime rib delivered to your door?"}
{"text":"OMG I had the banana cream pie and it was amazing.  It's difficult to not order a slice every time i visit.  I guess it's a good thing for me that they don't always have it available yet I always scan the pie case when I walk in."}
{"text":"Clam chowder is good.  1/2 chicken meal is huge.  All portions are large.  Second time here.  Fish dinner is excellent."}
{"text":"Food is amazing...only rivaled by the customer service. We require delivery and every time the food is delivered it is packaged with care and delicious. The pies are sooo good and the turkey and gravy hit the spot. Wish we knew about it sooner (staying across from Barrow). Yummy comfort food!"}
{"text":"After all of these years, it is still a great restaurant.   For around $10 you can get the best turkey and stuffing in town as well as a nice little salad bar!   This restaurant's name suits it perfectly. If you want some home cooking/comfort food for a decent price this is the place to go. For me it is like Thanksgiving year round.   What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I have been eating at this restaurant for over 15 years and I order delivery from here all the time and they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Salad bar is good and that's about it.  The meatloaf definitely needed the scant cup of gravy that it came with.  The green beans were without doubt, from a can.  The Irish Potatoes (LMAO) are the little round ones that I like, that also come in a can, but I never saw them served in a restaurant before.  The decor is old and homey, this place could use a restaurant makeover, utilizing part of the current decor,  modernizing it,  EXPANDING THE BAR and DRAFT BEER LIST, and using FRESH INGREDIENTS.   Great central location.  They should take advantage of it and polish up a bit."}
{"text":"Still love My Mother's after decades, however, of all the CenPho places that *should* have a corned beef and cabbage St. Paddy's Day special ... they do not!  I am told their customers ask for such year after year. Even better would be having it across 3 days, that is, 15, 16, and 17 of March. Surely Mother has a wee bit of Irish in her?  Come on, Mother's, it's long overdue! :-)"}
{"text":"If you enjoy good, home-cooked food, this is the place to go.  The have wonderful turkey and dressing and meatloaf.  You can order a full meal, a small meal or a sandwich any time of day.  Don't forget the pie!!!  You'll get a quarter of an 8\" pie and it just like grandma used to make.  By the way, bring an appetite!  The serving aren't small and the price is right."}
{"text":"I've actually been going to this great family restuarant for years.  Open faced roast beef; open faced turkey (real roast beef and real turkey-not the processed junk.  Wonderful homemade vegetable beef soup.  Can't say enough good about this little place.  Not the best part of town, but it's worth the drive.  Wish they'd move to Chandler."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last night. This place is spot on! The food was excellent and the price was very reasonable. The service was also top notch. As a restaurant manager I was impressed. Would Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Comfort food at its best   Clean, good food, great staff, delivery,    LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"No, no, no, you have got to stop going to overpriced, frou frou places where the food looks and tastes like it belongs in an art museum (whatever that means). I paid over $100 for 2 to eat buffalo steak at the new downtown Sheraton hotel and I could've sworn it was buffalo chips. My Mother's is an unpretentious hole in the wall yet the food really delivers! You've got to try their grilled salmon and grilled sea bass! Tender and full of flavor and affordable! Not to mention the freshly baked bread with honey butter that starts you out with. No wilted vegetables in the salad bar and you're right about their pies: home made and huge portions, especially their banana cream. Heaven! (sorry Marie Calendar's but you're just another McDonalds). The service is friendly and fast and there is a constant stream of customers and neighborhood folks."}
{"text":"Horrible food at way inflated prices. Booth bench seats way too low for the table heights. Worst experience I've had in a long time eating out. Then when paying the cashier she didn't know how to count change she gave me the wrong change and insisted that it was right. Never going back there again."}
{"text":"My mom never fed me arugula with beet and goat cheese, so \"My Mother's\" remains a go-to for me, has been one since the late 80's. Now have to overlook the aging neighborhood, facade and parking lot (well-lit, usually easier to park out back). Once inside, on the menu is good reliable home-style American food. Stick with the beef, turkey, fish, and spaghetti dishes. Chicken? Spotty. Pizza? Gak!  (Maybe for kids.) Mini salad bar with fresh in-house real blue cheese dressing. Apple pie? Just like mom used to make in the 70's (some won't like that). Green bean side is good enough to try once even if you usually wouldn't.  The service is almost always efficient and the relaxing main dining room is always clean. Biggest drawback is the temptation to overeat: it's comfort food!"}
{"text":"Interesting experience tonight for my first time eating here. I tried the prime rib on recommendation from a trusted source. The rib was juicy and tender but a little on the bland side and I was glad the straight horse radish came with it to help season it. Portion size was good, mashed potatoes were real but served with turkey or chicken gravy, I couldn't tell. As for the green beans, they were typical canned and heated variety reminiscent of the old days of Furrs cafeteria. The salad bar was clean and nicely stocked, try the blue cheese dressing, and dinner was served with a warm sweet tear apart dinner roll. Did the meal impress me? Kinda. I would eat here again when looking for a meal to remind me of how my mother used to cook, no pun intended. Good value and good service."}
{"text":"Hearty portions of home coookin' meals! I always get the turkey dinner, but have tasted the lasagna and spaghetti & meatballs,  both good. The warm, homemade bread is yummy and the pie, which I never have room for is huge! A slice is a 1/4 of a pie!"}
{"text":"Love this place, I've been going there for years and I've never had a bad experience. Also the buffalo wings there are amazing."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food, down home setting, and filling everytime.  I suggest the turkey dinner for a win-win situation. Also the prime rib is tasty. The salad bar is well varied and yummy.  If you want fancy this aint your spot. If you want a good filling meal then get some."}
{"text":"I went in really wanting to like this place because the reviews were so great, but I have to say it is just \"ok.\" The salad bar is teeny tiny and you only get a small plate to fill. Not a deal breaker, though. The main course was kind of bland, though. I think you should still give it a try to make your own opinion, but just don't got in with super high hopes like I did :)"}
{"text":"I had to chime in on My Mother's. I have been going to this place for years and it has always been one of my favorite places for comfort food in the valley. I have to let everyone out there reading some of the other reviews that they serve canned foods, is utterly ridiculous! I know for a fact they make everything from fresh ingredients and make their gravy like Mom or Grandma did. I'd like someone to bring me some canned gravy that has the flavor and consistency that it does here! Now that I'm done ranting, you  must try the turkey dinner! It is the bomb! Make sure you get the cranberry sauce with it. Meatloaf, prime rib, lasagne, are some of my families favs. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is the fact that they need to bring in a nicer table wine . Other than that leave the decor alone, it really is old phoenix. Pie.........you'll love any of them, whatever you are in the mood for, it will bring a smile to your face! Yum!"}
{"text":"I order from here all the time...no problems. Food is always delivered hot & spot on with the order. Good portions.  I recommend the pork chop. It's delicious. Wish there was more than 1 on the order. I like the variety of foods I can order - no fluff or fancy names...just good simple food."}
{"text":"I had tried this place for lunch on the recommendation of one of my employees. I had ordered the roasted turkey lunch special. This restaurant offers home cooked soul food. The service was excellent as I had a large take out order for 4 hungry folks. However, I was expecting more. The food lacked flavor. The pie slices I ordered were huge. One slice could easily be shared by two adults. The pie was also very mediocre. Unfortunately, I will not be going back but was glad that I gave it a try!"}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint!! Homemade fresh food. It was great! Our first time but will be back. They greet you with homemade fresh bread and warm !!"}
{"text":"Wow what can I say this place is clean food is yummy,and the staff are friendly and most welcoming. Well done to all the staff."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in uptown Central Phoenix. Although I felt a little salt overload from the Lasagna dinner last night I still think this is one of the more wholesome family style restaurants around. Terrific selection of entree's from your favorite home cooked meals to steaks, seafood and Italian items including Pizza. Cheap and great service!"}
{"text":"OMG, just 3 words needed here:  Turkey Pot Pie!!!!!!!!!!  I'm recovering from the latest contagious disease circulating through my office and needed comfort food that could be delivered!  Of course I thought of My Mother's because they have always been there for me.  And they have pie, which is always yummy.  I ordered the TPP (turkey pot pie ) AND a piece of pumpkin pie \"for tomorrow's breakfast\".    The TPP was nothing short of transcendental---and I don't say that lightly.  The pastry topping was perfect, the turkey and veggies were perfectly cooked, and the gravy was perfectly spiced as well.  The side of mashed potatoes and gravy that accompanied the TPP were also perfect.  I have always loved this place but the TPP literally bumped it up to my very short list of 5-star favorites!!!  P.S.  The pie didn't last until the morning either."}
{"text":"Pie. Go for the pie. Everything else is OK. But did I mention the pie is really good? Mmmm... pie."}
{"text":"From California we came across this restaurant on yelp. So glad we did huge portions, delicious & great prices! Loved the atmosphere I would definitely recommend this for comfort food.   Ordered: open face turkey mashed potatoes                  Chicken fried chicken (both were so good)"}
{"text":"I've been going to My Mother's for as long as I can remember.  I grew up just up the street from it.  I've never had a bad meal there.  The salad bar is always well stocked with a nice variety of items, nothing huge but just the right size for this restaurant.  The roast beef with mashed potatoes, green beans and gravy is excellent.  My son changes around, but usually ends up with the chicken fried steak which he loves.  So what if the decor isn't fancy? I'm going there to eat not pass some interior design test on the place.  They have made it homey and serve absolutely delicious food.  If some of you didn't like it because it wasn't fancy enough for you - don't let the door hit you on the way out and no one will miss you either!"}
{"text":"Very good comfort food! The turkey pot pie is out of this world! If your waitress is Mia, you will have the best service in Phoenix!!!!"}
{"text":"Kind of a homespun dive and the service seems spotty.   However the kitchen rocks!  Comfort food central in Phoenix.    Ordered the open face hot beef sandwich and the meat loaf dinner. Split a piece of apple pie. OMG - these guys have a magical kitchen. I don't know what is going on behind the doors but their gravy and pie are killer. We will be back. That meatloaf is sensational."}
{"text":"I first heard of this restaurant when my sister ordered in from there. The food was so good that it reminded me of a good home cooked Sunday meal. So I decided to try it myself, and much to my delight it was another great experience. The pies here are awesome, they give you a big slice of a delicious strawberry or cream pie (these are just ones I had they have plenty more). The portions were more than enough and left me (a big guy) very satisfied."}
{"text":"Say what you will about the decor and location; the food is great!  It is a neighborhood institution!  My all-time favorite is the roasted turkey dinner. My family and I came here on Thanksgiving Day several years ago, and it was better - WAY better - than my own mother's cooking. Mashed potatoes are homemade, creamy and flavorful.  Green beans are fresh, and as the other reviews state, the pies are terrific. Chocolate cream - yes please!    My sister loves the turkey pot pie, which is also delicious!  Staff are friendly, and have, on more than one occasion, accommodated my request to be seated in the back dining room so my hearing-impaired mother, could enjoy a little more quiet atmosphere.   Only suggestion I have is for a little update to the decor. It is overdue, and would be a good investment."}
{"text":"Decent food. The pizza is really cheap and when I got it I realized why it was so cheap not that great. The reason I gave my mommas 3 stars is for there amazing homemade pies if you get a slice its huge looks like half of a pie. Would recommend it for the pie but you can better food around the valley."}
{"text":"Meh. Everything was fine, edible, decent \"home cookin'\". Hubby had the pot pie which had great tasting filling but a tough crust. Since I won't be headed to Saugatuck, MI this summer, I won't be able to get my annual open faced roast beef at the Kalico Kitchen. So I decided to give Mother's version a try. Not too shabby. Dinners come with a lot of bread and butter, and some come with a trip to the salad bar. Hubby really liked their cole slaw.  Then, we fought over pie. I wanted coconut cream, but Hubby sat there dejectedly until I relented on the chocolate peanut butter. Damn manipulator. The filling was mighty tasty, but  I did not care for the stabilized whipped cream on top. It didn't taste as fresh as it should have. The pie slices are massive, so our sweet gamer-boy waiter brought it to us already cut in half.   We might be back, maybe some night when neither of us wants to cook and we're tired of the usual suspects."}
{"text":"Amazing comfort food, the chicken pot pie is very good and I would strongly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this place for awhile. We finally stopped in today for dinner. The food was terrific! I had the turkey dinner and my husband had the fried cod dinner. We were impressed everything was great, fresh hot homemade bread, salad bar had lots of options and you definitely will not go home hungry. Very large portions are served.  We had a great server, Heather Thank you for the great service it made our dinner even more enjoyable. Don't forget dessert! We took some yummy homemade apple pie for home. We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time and saw half of Glendale's police force there.  Can't be a bad sign, right?  Got the Turkey pot pie with a trip to the salad bar, plus a serving of bread. Salad bar is small, but the details shine through in the homemade blue cheese dressing and marinated beets.  Nice. Bread was nice and hot. Pot pie was quite sizable and the filling was heavenly.  Everything was simplicity done well.  Very homey.  Took the banana cream pie home because I couldn't stuff it after everything.  This is where some disappointment set in. The \"slice\" of pie looked huge! Perhaps my expectations were built up by the reviews so when I dug in and found it somewhat lacking the \"cream\" custard filling I just could not get over my disappointment. My favorite part of the pie was barely there, because it was just piles of bananas with a light dressing of whipped cream on a nice crust.  Hmm, personal preference perhaps, but I want my cream filling!  All in all, not a date place but a decent stop for some solid home-eats.  Would I return?  Only if I were in the area and I was really craving some big portions of homeyness. Oh, the waitresses were so sweet.  They deliver service like how it's done since our grand-mamas :) Thank you ladies! Now the only thing you have to do is put the cream back in \"banana cream pie\" and desert would be heavenly!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! What else can I say. Yes old, nostalgic and old. But delicious. My second visit. Meatloaf is fantastic and turkey homemade. Potato salad my favorite. Can't wait to go back! Yum! Did I say yum? You need to go give them a try!!! Hurry up and go!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this unassuming restaurant while on a business trip. The food is awesome, the fresh baked warm bread is AMAZING!  And they must be known for their pies. I tried chocolate cream pie. The slice was literally 1/4 of a pie. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"How did I forget to write a review for this place when I first joined yelp? Oh wait I know why, I did not want everyone packing this place resulting in no more delicious food for me LOL. I know I was being selfish but hey even food detectives have their little secrets. I was first introduced to this place back in 2004 by a guy I used to hang out with.   He promised me that nothing but good things would be found in this small and darkly lit place ( kind of got this feeling that I was in the restaurant scene from the godfather and  that I was not going to come out alive LOL). What this place lacks in updated decorations it definitely makes up with it's food.   First off if you have spent most of your life eating those hard as a rock rolls that everyone makes during the holidays you were being done wrong. This place offers bread that is soft, warm, and has a slight sweetness that leaves you wanting more. It is like when you are a kid and you imagine what eating a cloud would be like seriously no joke. It is just plain goodness. As others have stated they do have a one trip to the salad bar rule which they will enforce so make sure to follow it.  This is to make sure that you save room for all the mouth watering food you are about to be served, and served, and served. No that was not a typo or me spacing out and coping the same thing over and over again. This place takes the mother name to heart. Mother is a sweet old women who believes in making sure you eat well and a lot lol. No one leaves this place hungry I can guarantee you that!   Huge portions of ribs, chicken, and even Fred Flintstone dino steaks fill the menu and your stomach until you feel like you are going to bust. Topped off with a glass of sweet tea and you have one of the best meals in the valley. OK so it is out of the way for some and yes it does look like a place that may have been really popular in the 1950-70's but that just means they spend more time making the food taste so good. After all do you go to a restaurant to look at their selection of chairs or to eat LOL.  If nothing else you have to try the pie this place cranks out. If you always wanted to have a grandma who made you cookies but had the one who always bought ones from the store this is your chance to see what you have been missing. I recommend the banana cream pie ( oh wait, on second thought try the other ones banana is my fav). Their pies are creamy, and will make you almost think about packing up and moving closer to this place if you do not already live near by. The point is try this place and make sure you do as the old saying goes \"do not judge a book by it's cover or you may miss out on some really good food.  Case closed"}
{"text":"Tonight I had the fathers prime rib 11 ounces medium rare. It came with a salad bar, two sides & homemade bread. I chose green beans & mashed potatoes. Everything tasted sooooooo good and fresh!  You can tell nothing came from a can. Even the horse radish tasted like it was just made for me. I felt I went back in time, I LOVE this place!!!"}
{"text":"I used to work at this place a long time ago, and went back recently.  The food is as good as ever, the service is fantastic, the prices are reasonable, and the owner is hot.  What more could you want?  I highly recommend the turkey, the prime rib, and the spareribs.  i'm not a rib eater, and the spare ribs are the best I've ever had...you won't be sorry, I promise!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming into the restaurant. Ordered chicken and ribs with a one trip salad. It was a lot of food!  Salad bar is small, but it was only a few dollars more.  I'd eat there again!  Parking was really tight. I went close to 5:30 p.m. on a week day. I know there is a little more parking in the back, but I lucked out and found a spot in front. They served soft bread to our table and the tea was great."}
{"text":"Working evenings at Central and McDowell with no designated lunch break, our food choices are Blue Fin (if we get there before 6:30). CVS if we get there before 8, or having My Mother's, Siu Wok or pizza delivered.  No wonder I usually bring my own food from home!  I've ordered or tasted most everything on the menu (thanks, sharing co-workers!) - and it's all incredibly decent.  I can't say I've tried anything terrible - but it's very middle of the road, perfectly OK food.  A couple mentions for the plus side - the advertised big slice of pie is HUGE - a quarter of a pie, actually!  I don't do dairy, but have heard great reviews of the chocolate cream pie.  (I was told the banana creme was pretty much lacking banana flavor - but the creme was homemade and amazing, so still worth it.)  The other big plus - I ordered a BLT which came with obscene amounts of bacon.  I was expecting about half the bacon that ended up being there.  That alone is worth a star!  On the minus side - bread choices are white and weat hamburger buns and white sub rolls.  I wanted my BLT on sourdough.  Had to settle for a white bun.  Not ideal, but not a deal breaker if you know about it going in. A couple weeks ago, I ordered the peach pie, available seasonally.  They did not have any.  HELLO?  Mid to late May in Phoenix?  It is PRIMO peach season if you're looking for the freshest you can get.  Which is really two minuses - the lack of pie I wanted AND showing they don't care about sourcing locally.  I'll continue patronizing My Mother's.  Like I wrote above - haven't gotten anything BAD.  But it will likely be for delivery when Chinese and pizza just aren't calling to my tastebuds.  I don't see a reason I'd go out of my way to dine in the restaurant - especially with so many great CenPho choices, I won't go out of my way for mediocrity."}
{"text":"Made our first two visits in the same week, it is THAT good! We even brought friends to celebrate with. Thank you for having such deliciously comforting food and friendly staff. We feel like we've found family!"}
{"text":"Always a treat to eat a turkey dinner in August.... our waitress was soo nice going out of her way to make sure my dad could eat the food (he just had dental work)  cant wait to try the pizza... we love this little jem of a restaurant"}
{"text":"The food that comes out of this place is delicious!! First time here and impressed will be back."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place almost daily for years but yesterday some of my co-workers and I ate lunch there. Most of us had the Cod fish lunch special with fries lemon and butter. One  co-worker had chicken fried steak, another had roast beef and mashed potatoes with brown gravy.  She enjoyed the potatoes and gravy of course, she said the meat needed more seasoning.  I had the cod fish but I learned I could switch out the fries for a veggie, I had the greens which were the highlight of my meal. Those green beans were so good I could actually see myself getting two sides  of green beans to go often. I hope they'll sell them to me. My co-workers loved the bread, two of them bought loaves to go. I didn't, there's no way I want to be alone in my house with a loaf of good bread when I have butter!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location since the 80's. Went with a friend for lunch. With out a doubt one of the best PRIME RIB sandwiches I have ever had. My friend ordered his Super Rare, just cut the horns off the cow and serve it. I ordered MED because you never know. Both sandwiches were served just as ordered. The other good thing is the price. $8+ per sandwich with sides. The waitress couldn't have been more attentive. I asked for something special with my soup and it was delivered just right. Drinks were filled and she asked if everything was as ordered. What more could you ask for. Will be back with my wife for lunch in the future."}
{"text":"We live in Fountain Hills and the drive is worth every morsel of deliciousness that My Mother's cooks.  The food is beyond fantastic and service is top notch.  If you are lucky to have Mia as your server, she will go over and above to make sure your dining experience is perfect.  The bread... hot and amazing..  the salad bar ingredients are fresh and scrumptious.  Every entree is homemade and wonderful.  The grand finale are the icing on the cake pies.  Thank you for never disappointing and for maintaining your incomparable standards as best comfort food in the Valley!  Love, Barry, Merrill & Ross"}
{"text":"Friends told me about this place which evidently has been around for a long time.  Wife and I tried it for lunch twice but haven't tried it for a supper.  We were seated in a room to the right and it was quiet,  decorated like someones dining room, and very at-home feeling.   There is a daily lunch special.  On Thursday it's chicken fried steak with choice of white or brown gravy.  I had the white and it came with the taste of bacon drippings in it....just like my mother used to make!  It was excellent..simply excellent.  Am planning on going back today (Thurs) to see if it's excellent twice.  I don't like Turkey which seems to be Mother's claim to fame.  Wife liked it so much that the second time she had the turkey again.  I've also tried the roast beef which I don't normally care for but this was excellent.  It came on a open  bread bun.  The beef was excellent.  A couple of men in a neighboring table were raving about the pot pie.  Will try that next time. I gave it four stars but considering that it's American down home cuisine, and that that kind of restaurant is very hard to find it probably deserves five stars. If you try it, you'll like it.  Guaranteed."}
{"text":"I emailed these people 2x about my delivery. NO response. Very disappointed in the food & lack of response. Here is the email I wrote: I ordered 2 large pizzas & the turkey dinner. I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the food. The pizza crust was the equivalent of a frozen pizza...a very bad frozen pizza. The sauce was eh. Turkey was good, nice that it was actual turkey breast, not sliced cold cut turkey. But the \"roasted vegetables\", sorry, those were stewed vegetables taken out of a pot roast & put into the delivery container with the oil from the stew. Very unsavory. On the whole, paying nearly $40 for this meal was a gross injustice. I saw many glowing reviews on Yelp & was looking forward to this meal. I wish I just had cereal."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner last night after not visiting for well over 10 years.  Nothing has changed inside the restaurant, but the food remains just as good as I remembered it.  We split two meals and really enjoyed trying so much variety - chicken fried chicken, meatloaf, mixed veggies, green beans, mashed potatoes and rice pilaf...so tasty and just like grandma used to make.  We finished up our meal with a slice of pie each - apple for the hubby and chocolate cream for me...so delicious and huge (1/4 of the pie = each slice!). This will definitely become our \"go to\" restaurant when we are looking for comfort food and amazing pie."}
{"text":"We love coming over here for dinner.meat loaf is the best we drive all the way from Union Hills n cave creek rd just for dinner"}
{"text":"The restaurant is fantastic. Good portions at a great value with a homemade feel. Turkey dinner and meatloaf are two great dinner choices and banana cream pie is the best we've ever had."}
{"text":"Phoenix is big, but so is the reward you'll earn by getting across it to My Mother's. You'll enter a homey-decorated time machine back to when food and drink were generous and scrumptious and service was authentic and personable. In the latter function, look for Teresa, who presented our chicken-themed dinner entrees --- chicken tenders, chicken-fried steak, and chicken-fried chicken --- with ample sassy conversation. And how about that fresh-most salad bar, and the potent margaritas? We were lucky enough to catch Mother herself, on a rare visit from her place of retirement, but once you've visited the place, your return visits won't be rare at all."}
{"text":"Nice drive a little far from  home but totally worth it. Go early it gets busy. Going again real soon."}
{"text":"Of course 5 stars!! Great service! Best food! Lice bbq ribs here and little salad bar....  Recommend to try!!!!"}
{"text":"Great home style meals. Definitely worth it if you want huge portions of comfort food. Couldn't possibly eat it all at once.   Try the blueberry pie too!"}
{"text":"I give them a four stars for their food quality. The mashed potatoes, gravy, roast turkey, chicken etc. are all wonderful. The green beans are just amazing. It's the dressing that we can't stomach, just way too much celery.  Overpowers everything!  The reason I give them a two star review, is because no matter how hard we try to explain our order in simple terms, repeat, confirm, they almost always get it wrong. At least 40% of the time we end up with dressing when we clearly say we want no dressing. Apparently there are mysterious rules and methods for ordering extra gravy that we cannot fathom. Sometimes we get charged for it, sometimes we get charged double for it, mystery pricing is always an effect on whatever we order to go.  We even quit going for a while in hopes that it would get better. After a hiatus we ordered again tonight, and lo and behold, dressing on both of the turkey plates. Their food is good, but it's not worth the aggravation.   It's a shame too, because we really do want to frequent the place."}
{"text":"Came here with my sister we had a late dinner I had the spaghetti with meat sauce and meat balls it was very delicious she had the pork chop dinner her words perfect"}
{"text":"I will say one good thing before I go into how DISGUSTING the food was. I ordered delivery and it was fast and friendly. The food was gross. I ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and it came with a salad but no salad dressing???? The spaghetti sauce was sweet and didn't have much meat. I also ordered the blueberry pie and only had a taste. The filling was creamy and the crust was soggy. So gross! Never again."}
{"text":"My Rating is specifically do to the pizza. My family and I can all agree that the pizza from the store like a Red Baron frozen pizza is waaaay better tasting than the pizza served here! Very low quality and just bad tasting. The service was great though and the complimentary fresh bread and butter was very tasteful."}
{"text":"If you go out for the decor, this is not the place for you.  But if you like good comfort food at a very reasonable price, this is an excellent place for that.  The salad bar was very fresh.  I was a little afraid but when I got there, the lettuce was crisp and all the ingredients were properly kept.  I ordered the pot roast which was awesome.  The wait staff was very friendly.  I am not impressed easily but this place was exceptional.  I would definitely return.  I have eaten in alot of places in Phoenix and have not been moved most of the time, but this place is a great place for someone who love a nice meal and is not watching their weight.  The banana cream pie was awesome.  A pound of pie with fresh cream and fresh banana."}
{"text":"From the homemade turkey and dressing to the prime rib, Chicken strips off the kids menu or chicken fried steak this place is amazing. The food is fresh and homemade, the salad bar is better than any other. The pie is homemade and regularly sells out. Yes, the neighborhood is sketchy but you would never know dining here. It is a clean safe environment and I enjoy taking my family here regularly. If you take away anything from this review, GET A SLICE OF PIE!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just discovered this place not too long ago and it turned out to be a wonderful experience. I was craving some chocolate cream pie and this place popped up in my search with some positive reviews so we decided to check it out, and I couldn't have been more pleased. It was the absolute perfect chocolate cream pie and I honestly don't think there's a lot out there who can compete. The crust was flaky and buttery and perfectly complimented the chocolate cream filling. Might I add that the sliced are a generous QUARTER of the entire pie. So there's that too.  So we definitely found our new spot for pie and playing cards. This place has such a 'homey' feel and you can tell it's been around for a long time - in a good way!"}
{"text":"I have only had their cheesecake but omg. It is the best plain cheesecake I think I have ever had and it is huge. I can't wait to go their one day and try some comfort food."}
{"text":"Don't Judge A Book By Its Cover  To look at \"My Mothers Restaurant\" from the outside, one would think, there's not much to see, but step through the doors and you will  change your mind.   As you walk in to \"Mothers\"  you can't help but notice the glass cases of delicious looking pies immediately upon entering the restaurant.  The pies alone will  make you want to sit down and stay for a while.  This was my first visit to \"Mothers\" but it won't be my last.  The restaurant is clean, comfortable and has many tasty options to choose from. On this visit I ordered the open-faced turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy; what could be more delicious and satisfying?    The food is good and the portion size will not leave anyone hungry.  If there is still room after your entree, \"Mother's\" delicious pies await.  I recommend the peanut butter and chocolate cream pie.  So if you're ever in the mood for some good old fashioned comfort food  and find yourself in the area of  \"Mother's\" stop by you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One food will make you wow= mashed potato.  If you find any place that have better mashed potato than this place let me know:) But for now this is the best place to get mashed potato.  There turkey is like heaven!!! On top of the juicy flavored meat, its topped with gravy. The chicken here also ruins alot of the chicken i have tasted for a long time. :)   Cozy place. Something that whole family can just chill and relax.  Okay but theres more!! Not only the food are tasty, they are also HUGE! Their sandwich can feed 2 persom their pies (ONE slice) can feed 3 person, no joke.   I cant believe after taking home 3 boxes full of home made bread, half of each our orders we only paid 30 @_@ with a freaking tip!! Woaaaaahhhh!!!  If you dont believe me, go try it. Then you can thank me for making you believe."}
{"text":"Wow!! What a surprise! Ordered delivery after getting a menu hung on our door knob. I mean, homemade meatloaf, mashed potatoes and gravy, and green beans delivered?! Sure! What I didn't expect was it to be delicious and taste JUST LIKE HOME!! If I didn't know better I'd swear I was at Sunday dinner back in Illinois. I can't wait to try more! (And have it delivered for just $2.25!)"}
{"text":"Turkey dinner was good, prime rib was ok,  meat loaf was terrible,  do not order the meat loaf,  I repeat,  do not order the meat loaf.  weird taste and texture. Liked the salad bar."}
{"text":"Ummm, just ordered delivery from here and the pizza is total crap! Do not order if you like pizza lol! It is worse than digornos or any frozen pizza. Should have went to Safeway and got a frozen one, would have been much better. I have no idea about the other food they offer but please,  stay away if you are going to order pizza. It is crap!"}
{"text":"We ve been coming here pretty often. The outside and inside doesn't look like much but they don't skimp on their meals.    Service is always great. They are super friendly and comes by frequently to keep your table clear.  The complimentary wheat bread comes in a little loaf.  It's simple but so good. Comes hot with butter.  Their menu looks confusing at first and even repetitive but it's mostly just split into lunch and dinner portions.    I like the ribs, bbq chicken, and lasagna here.  Their portions are generous and truly,  you are getting way more for your buck here than anywhere else similar (cough chains cough) Most things on the dinner menu are under $11.00.  The only thing is they really could fix up the inside a bit,  but I understand if they can't or won't.  The booths sag and some of the paintings are off putting. Also I wished the sides that come with the plates had more oomph. Most times they are pretty bland tasting.  Also,  they seem small, especially in contrast to the generous main course. Maybe that's just my selective experiences.  Come for a home style cooked meal."}
{"text":"Love this place. The service, food and salad bar are excellent. Great desserts too. Only downfall is the parking so carpool if in a group."}
{"text":"If you are someone that cooks at home, you might be less impressed with MMR, but even so, there are a few things on their menu that are standouts.  The turkey meal is really quite good and I like that you can choose the sides that are to your liking.  The chicken and dumpling soup is thick and creamy (and even a little addictive).  The first time that I saw it as one of the daily offerings, I asked what the server thought it was sort of funny when she told me that people will call about the daily selections and come in when this one is offered... now I am one of those people. During strawberry season, you cannot leave without having a slice of the strawberry pie. It is piled with fresh berries and covered in a mountain of freshly whipped cream.  Portions are large, so if you want pie consider taking a slice (1/4 of a pie) home with you.  The crust isn't the most tender, but the flavor is good and they generally have at least six flavors to choose from. Fruit fillings are made from scratch, so you are best off choosing something that is in season.  Hint: if you are going to buy two slices, it is actually just as cheap to get a whole pie.  I really do like this place for some of the more exceptional choices, the fact that they have a relatively extensive menu, and that they deliver.  Upping their rating to 4 stars.  :)"}
{"text":"This place is really delicious homemade food. We have tried so many things on the menu but keep coming back to the turkey dinner.  Also took a homemade strawberry pie home.   Don't let the small salad bar fool you the dinner portions plus a loaf of their homemade bread is enough almost for two ppl unless you are really hungry."}
{"text":"I was hoping for some good home cooking but.....the appetizers were promising. French bread and mozzarella sticks were good. Only if the service was as good. Service was very slow. From taking our orders to receiving the bill. I am sure we could of walked out and no one would of noticed for another 30 minutes. If the food was not only above average I might of not been as irritated with the waiter but the whole experience makes me not want to come back."}
{"text":"Great spaghetti with meatballs and sauce, like made in home. The home made bread is awesome! A well hidden gem of comfort food in middle town just blocks from home."}
{"text":"we were looking for a fairly close, not to expensive, good food place..tired of the same o same places. So we looked this up and gave it a try. It is a step into the westside. The restaurant 's ambiance is out of the past, but it was clean and the service was good. I ordered a turkey pot pie with one trip to the salad bar. my partner ordered the half roasted chicken dinner. Bread came to the table first. God..it was fresh and tasty..really home made. The food arrived promptly . Their was enough food to feed four people. The Turkey pot pie was huge . I actually had large chunks of white meat turkey, potatoes, carrots, a few peas (thank god) It was hot. The crust was good .Only criticism would be that it was a bit dry and the crust could have been more flaky like a pie crust. The chicken was perfect...dressing was like thanksgiving. veggies all good. added coconut cream pie ..one piece...it was ok..a bit dense and the crust was not flaky. All this with tea was 27 bucks. A good meal at a fair price. the pot pie made DUCE and ESSENCE pot pies look and taste like crap. hats off to this place. If you are hungry and with limited funds....this is a great place.by the way...the salad bar was clean and the lettuce was fresh and not limmpy...good things to put on the salad. impressive for the price. will go back."}
{"text":"I LOOOOOVE this place!! Home cooking that's hearty, delicious and soooo satisfying. Great staff, super attentive and friendly aaaaand service was quick. Prices are reasonable and portions are large. You cannot leave here hungry!  I could go on and on. I've tried only a few items, but have enjoyed every one  Oh, and the homemade pies.....!!  Mmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"If you're craving that home cooked food but don't feel like going out to get it and want it delivered this is a great the perfect place for you to try. Try their chicken fried chicken it's my favorite. Are you one of those that like dessert for dinner try their pies all of them are my favorite. I can never decide which one I like best."}
{"text":"Great hospitality provided here. Open face turkey with the cranberry sauce and spaghetti with meatball are my go to meals. My man at the front always hooks it up with the nice loaf of bread as well!"}
{"text":"Tonight we ordered a \"chicago style deep dish\" pepperoni pizza. It was unlike any other I've ever had. It was basically just a 3 inch thick crust topped with your run of the mill bought in canned sauce, cheese and somewhat decent pepperoni. Over all the pizza was not a big hit. We also got a coconut cream pie as well, i hoped it would redem the meal... no luck. Where to start, the crust was very salty, the dough had also been very overworked, making it hard as rock and very dry. The coconut filling was bland and almost doughy. I would have preferred a frozen pizza and pie from safeway, and i wouldnt have had to pay $33 for it. Not worth it at all. I hate criticizing restaurants, because i like to hope that someone is putting their heart and soul into their products, but sometimes you have to hear the bad to be aware of what you need to do to be better."}
{"text":"My Wife and I stopped here last night after doing some shopping downtown, We've been coming here for years, and she and her family have been coming there since she was a little girl, it's a little bit off of the beaten path, but worth a stop, it's doesn't look like much from the outside and the building is kind of old, but these kind of family owned businesses are hard to come by, most of the dinners  range from $8-10, I'm a big fan of the country fried steak, the -portion is good size, the gravy is the right thickness, the meat isn't too gristly or fatty, their mash potatoes seem to be homemade and fresh, and the corn on the cob I had was sweet and juicy. their bread is to die for, and all dinners come with a salad bar which is surprisingly well stocked.  definitely a favorite when in search of comfort food, we can usually get a table with little or no wait, and the service is always attentive."}
{"text":"Ordered their special for pizza and 12 spicy wings. I am kinda a wing snob, so I wasn't too impressed as they murdered some baby chicken to get the wings. My gf would have claimed them to be spicy... but she thinks peper is spicy. They also forgot the celery and ranch (oh well, wasn't upset with that). However, the pizza was good, not greasy, thin crust, and really delicious, And for the price, you really can't beat it.. $17 (w/o tip), so there really isnt a fast food pizza joint that could do this. But if you slightly feel hungry, order, it may take awhile. It is worth it! On a funny note, if you pay with card, they do a carbon copy of your card... so its old school, like your mama was running the joint. I'll give them a couple of more tries! Maybe even eat in as they have some homemade meals, which everyone seems to rave about!"}
{"text":"This place brings back memories of going to my local midwest podunk steakhouse.  The decor is hideous but in a good way, the salad bar has Bacos, I didn't even know they still existed, but I loved them as a kid.  The bread they serve tastes freshly baked and the staff is relaxed, low key and friendly.  Prime rib is very tasty and incredibly reasonably priced.  The chicken fried steak somethin sometin is very good as well.  This is comfort food at its finest.  I think they may be a bit generous on the salt and butter, but leave your guilt at the door and get your fork and knife ready."}
{"text":"I've be hearing about this place for a while now, from who else.. my mother. She eats hear every once in awhile with her friends and raves about. Today was my turn. I was her guest and it was great.   A very unassuming, cozy place. To start with, we entered from the back which was kind of the kitchen. I mean, there were people preparing food and making pies, so.. I guess that's ok because I liked seeing where my food was going to be made. It was immaculate, by the way.  The service was excellent. The Hostess and servers were nice and polite, and anywhere that has it's first dollar taped to the wall along side softball team pictures and giant trophies gets big points with me.  My mom had the meatloaf, which she always has, and I had the same. It came with choice of sides. I had irish potatoes,steamed veggies and a salad for starters. Meatloaf was awesome, but go ahead and ask for a to-go container right off the bat.. you won't finish it.  I must say, I was quite satisfied with the meal. To top it off, they played \"happy birthday\" over the PA and brought out a huge wedge of cheese cake, which I haven't eaten yet. They also took my picture and printed it out on photo paper before we left.  All and all, a good birthday meal at a friendly place.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Good home style cooking and a HUGE piece of PIE!!! Turkey dinner anyday, YEAH!!"}
{"text":"Came on Valentines Day. Food and staff were amazing as always! Must get the coconut cream pie when visiting here!"}
{"text":"My Mother's has exceptional homemade food. The staff is very kind and caring to all of your needs. The food took a while to come out, but I know that's because it's great. A great place to go with a wide variety of food to choose from. Amazing."}
{"text":"Delicious, generous portions, and reasonable.  Lots of classics like fresh carved turkey, spare ribs, meat loaf; delicious salmon, too.  Servers are A+, and so is the pie...each piece is a whole pound.  (Ask them to warm it in the pizza oven)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a slice of pie while we were in the area. The pies were absolutely delicious, and a slice is actually a 1/4 of a whole pie. We'll worth the price for the portion and quality.  The service though was not the greatest. However, I am still giving it 4 stars as the cashier mentioned that it was an off day, and busier than usual as well as being under staffed.  We'll see how the service goes on our next visit."}
{"text":"My coworker came here for lunch and I had asked him to order something for me to bring back to the office. I decided on the Turkey Pot Pie and that thing was definitely delicious and comforting! I almost ate the whole thing and it was pretty big! They also gave a side of mash potatoes that weren't as good. I could of done without them, but you definitely should come for the Turkey Pot Pie. Yummy!!! The prices are inexpensive too!"}
{"text":"Dinner here with family members. Large, varied menu. Heather was our server. She was pleasant and efficient. I had the ribs and salad  bar. Salad bar had a good selection of veggies and dressings. Ribs were OK but not stellar. Mashed potatoes were real and gravy was tasty.. I want to try the chicken fried chicken sometime. My sister had the blt and it was loaded with bacon."}
{"text":"Would recommend because of the variety in food choices. Choose from sandwiches and soups, pizza and wings to plated entrees with rice, veggies and mash potatoes. What this place is known for, however, is their pies. Try it.  Con: the place is in an older neighborhood and it shows. Nevertheless, inside is kept clean. Serving also for the price is small. Taste for plated entrees was a hit and miss. Shrimp scampi with veggies was good. Children's chicken junior for my niece however was dry."}
{"text":"I felt like I was transported back to 1979.  The comfort food, the decor, and service with a smile was like stepping back in time. The food was so good and was definitely made from scratch. We had fried chicken, mashed potatoes and green beans. Yum! The free salad bar was awesome and the blueberry pie a la mode was amazing too. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Simple, home cooked American fair. Served in huge portions, in a nondescript strip mall behind a gas station.   Just north of bustling 19th Ave and Indian School, this family style restaurant has been dishing up delicious meals like chicken fry, pot roast, and steak since 1977.   Parking can be a bit difficult, especially if they're busy, but there is a large shopping area next door with a huge parking lot if you don't mind a walk. Each time I have come in I've been seated quickly, though there is clearly a large waiting area when you first walk in, including an old Pac man table top game.   Each meal comes with a choice of soup or salad from their salad bar, and one or two sides (mashed potatoes, French fries, mixed veggies, and the like) and each entree is large enough to sate two people's appetite. I've yet to try an appetizer (soup or salad comes immediately after ordering) and I haven't tried any of their deserts though the slices of pie are at least as large as the portion of meat you get with dinner.   Quality is good, food is simple but delicious, full bar with cheap beers, and a homie atmosphere. Can be a bit loud and definitely gets busy during the weekday lunch rush but more than worth it for food just like mom used to make (not mine but thankfully someone's haha)."}
{"text":"This was super great food and awesome service! Its March so we don't tend to eat a turkey, dressing, mashed potatoes, green beans, and cranberry sauce. That is what I got and it was so good! The turkey was so tender that you could just pull it apart! I went here with 3 of my family members and we were all very happy with our food. Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"I have a special place in my heart for My Mother's because it was where I broke my 15 year streak of vegetarianism.  And I never had any of the alleged gastrointestinal repercussions that I anticipated.  The roast turkey is better than my mom ever made, not that it means much because my mom never cooked.  But it's still good.  The salad bar is pretty awesome too.  It's small, but they manage to fit almost every thing I could possibly want into a four foot long space.  And, they have real homeade bleu cheese dressing that tastes like bleu cheese throughout.  Not like the crappy version that tastes like ranch with bleu cheese lumps in it.  I had the pizza once and was incredibly underwhelmed.  Maybe it's better when you get it at the restaurant and not as take-out, but I'll never try it again.  It reminded me of a frozen pizza.  Today, because we're on a mission to find awesome wings, ordered some wings as our appetizer.  Our entrees came out before our appetizer.  But when we told the waiter they immediately put them in to cook to our specifications.  Then they didn't charge us for it.  Nice!  Bad service?  No, just an honest mistake that they immediately corrected.  The wings however were not that good.  They were cooked crispy like we like it and the sauce had the right ingredients, but the ratio of butter:vinegar:heat was off.  Too much butter!  I felt like I was eating wings in cream sauce it was so buttery.  It coated my mouth with an oily gunk for far too long.  Maybe I wouldn't have noticed if it actually came as an appetizer.  I still love My Mother's, particularly for the stuff that my mother should have made: turkey, chicken, meat loaf, turkey pot pie, etc.  But I would stay away from the wings and pizza."}
{"text":"#4 in an on-going series of restaurants I've never set foot in.  Sporting one of the most conversation-muddling names in recent history, My Mother's Restaurant serves up home cookin' just like your mom hypothetically used to make. No matter how you look at it, My Mother's is \"A Good Place To Be\"  Their specialty is homemade meals. All dinners come with mashed potatoes and gravy, corn and a dinner roll. Your choice of entrees includes meat loaf, prime rib, roast beef, spare ribs and many more. My Mother's also offers pastas, sandwiches (the open-faced turkey sandwich is quite tasty), roasted chicken, salads and pizza.   My Mother's has some of the best homemade pie I've yet to encounter in Phoenix. The Coconut Cream and Chocolate Cream pies are outstanding with a melt in your mouth crust. Slices of pie run around $4, but when you can get an entire pie for just over double the price of a single slice, you'll be face-deep in an entire pie in no time.   My Mother's, of course, delivers and also offers catering services. They don't deliver between the hours of 2pm and 5pm, however, so bear that in mind the next time you crave a slice of sin."}
{"text":"Any time of year, if I'm craving a home cooked turkey dinner with mashed potatoes and stuffing and cranberry sauce, I know I need to look no further than My Mother's Restaurant. The turkey has always been tender and moist, the mashed potatoes real and the gravy tasty. A fresh whole wheat loaf of bread to mop up the gravy and I am done for. It's always filling and satisfying. Their prime rib and every other meal I've ever eaten there were just as good. Simple, tasty filling home style food is their niche! Their pies are very good and it's not some little 1/8th or 1/6th sliver, it's a quarter of a pie!. Either still be hungry, plan on sharing with a friend (or do what I do and get it to go, then you've got a late night snack. Fancy expensive decor and furnishings, nope. The food keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food I love this place the turkey and dressing dinner is so delicious and my husband loves the meatloaf."}
{"text":"A nice homestyle cooking restaurant tucked away in a strip mall.  Step in and step back to 1960's/1970's with great food and great service the way it used to be.  My husband found it on Yelp, trying to find a place for prime rib.  Little did he know we would find so much more.  After reading about the raves of their turkey, apparently everyone else had discovered it, too, and they had run out.  I got the meatloaf instead and was impressed.  (And so was the prime rib hubby had been jonesing for. ) You can tell a good cook by their meatloaf.  The salad bar had fresh veggies and something I hadn't seen for awhile, green olives!  The bread was delicious, but I was saving room for the pie.  PIES!  It is not just a slice of pie, but 1/4 of the pie.  Our table tried the blueberry, apple and chocolate peanut butter.  I wish we had more people so I could sample more!  Not only do they have good cooks at this place, but bakers, too!   My sister who lives in Phoenix and had never heard or been to this place, went back two days later - and got the apple pie again.  Funny, she didn't share any of her apple pie the first time, so you know this has to be probably the best apple pie she's had.  Proof that you should check Yelp when visiting new cities and even where you live.  You'll discover good eating, good service and a good time."}
{"text":"Their pies are incredible! My favorites have got to be blueberry and banana cream; super yummy. And, the country fried steak and meatloaf are both totally good as well. Extremely reasonably priced considering the quality of the food. Totally satisfying American comfort food for sure."}
{"text":"We all had a really good meal. Lasagne, prime rib sandwich and open face meatloaf sandwich. Brown gravy flooded the mashed potatoes and meatloaf but it was still really good! Free cheesecake for your birthday!"}
{"text":"Went out in the limb and decided to try these guys out! The decor is a lil dated but it adds to the experience . Went with a party of 6 and went a little late and didn't feel rushed to get out of there. Our waitress made the experience a lot better she was a blast I would go back to have her wait in us again make sure u guys ask for Theresa  OMG was she great"}
{"text":"I remember coming to My Mother's when I was little. Always fond memories here. Decided to revisit this blast from the past tonight with my folks. I had the shrimp scampi with mashed potatoes and rice pilaf. The dinner bread was warm and a good starter. The shrimp was nicely seasoned. The mashed potatoes were excellent and the rice pilaf was fair. Overall, the atmosphere is one of your grandmother's sitting room. Quaint and cozy. Got a strawberry cream pie to go so hopefully, my good experience will continue. My Mother's still has its old school charm, would recommend."}
{"text":"Teressa was our attentive server, this no fancy pancy place, but the food is tasty, generous and the price is right. You have to come to this restaurant for lunch or dinner, this is what good un-pretentious food is about, good old turkey, stuffing and gravy, wonderful prime rib, they even deliver,  wow you just have to eat here, 10 thumbs up."}
{"text":"I was craving pie on 12-8-14 and the only place close to me was My Mothers Restaurant. I wasn't thrilled, but i sure the hell was not gonna go to Coco's or Village Inn. So off to \"Mother's\" I went. I already knew I wanted it to go, so I did not stay for the full service or the ambiance of the place. My friend that came with me ordered the Apple Pie, and I wanted the Pumpkin pie but I'm a self proclaimed pumpkin pie snob,so I was leery of ordering it. After all,I was there ordering pie to go, I didn't want to get home and be disappointed so I ordered the coconut cream pie. Then I said to hell with it and also ordered the pumpkin pie...I figured my coconut pie will be my fall back when I throw the pumpkin pie in the trash and yell at myself for ever ordering two slices of pies. I asked \"Trudy\" the young lady helping us to put whip cream all over the pumpkin pie... For me, that's the only way to eat it, and man she didn't hold back, it was the perfect amount. As I got home I could wait for my taste test,even though I already had made my mind up it tasted horrible before I even tried it. So the moment of truth was in front of me as I'm starring at this slice of pie, which by the way is a quarter of the pie. The slices are huge!! I grabbed my fork and dug in. I first looked at the consistency of the filling, it looked really good, not over cooked and was actually made with real ingredients. The crust was thick,buttery and flaky completely home made. As I opened my mouth and placed this bite of pie onto my pallet I knew this was not the ordinary restaurant type of pie.. this was actually a homemade pie that someones mom,dad,aunt,grandma,sister etc actually made. The spices were just perfect for me, and it actually reminded me of my mom's pumpkin pie. I ate the entire slice, then yelled at myself when I realized I have a huge slice of coconut pie starring at me!! This is the only place I have ever found that has legit pumpkin pie...Costco's pumpkin pie is crap,Village Inn pie is crap, Coco's pies are crap compared to this. Now it could be a fluke and I might have gotten the head chefs pie I don't know, but I will be back to see trudy again and have her slop on a huge heaping of whipped cream on my pumpkin pie. And a side note, my friend like her apple pie a lot. I did have a taste and it was very flavorful with big apple slices.  Now,I'm off to try this coconut pie. I gave it 5stars on pie rating only... not for anything else."}
{"text":"Turkey dinner?  Yes please!  I'd love to tell you about the many dishes I've tried and how good everything is however, I only ever order the turkey dinner.  You can't go wrong. Thanksgiving on a plate and no dishes and only the family you take with you.   When you eat there you get to partake of the salad bar which is well stocked and has a nice variety. The staff is always helpful and friendly.    I hear the pie is amazing but I never have any room and take half of my dinner home."}
{"text":"This place has a cozy atmosphere with your favorite American comfort foods. I have been here several times. The chicken fried steak, the meatloaf, and rotisserie chicken are all  good quality meats and prepared well. The blue cheese dressing at the salad bar is the best I have had in Phoenix.  The downside....you'll want to get back on your diet soon after."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed them yet. I've been going here off and on since childhood. My Mother's tastes like homecooking.   I highly recommend the chicken fried steak and chicken fried chicken. They are my favorites. The prime rib is decent for the price. The mashed potatoes with bacon flavored gravy is always tasty. They have a small but enjoyable salad bar. And the last time I dined here, I noticed a trip to the salad bar is included with the entree. Before, I think there was a nominal fee.   The worst thing I can say about the food is the hot vegetables taste like they're prepared from a frozen bag. I usually always go with corn on the cob. And it's good but you can tell it's not fresh. I ordered a delivery pizza once. It has a home cook taste to it. Specifically the crust tastes like it was made from a bisquick mix or something. It's not bad, but I like the blue plate special type food better than their pizza. They also have a good selection of pies. The menu prices are pretty cheap too. Don't expect anything fancy, but overall it's a good family type restaurant."}
{"text":"Good place for a decent meal at a reasonable price.  The inside is a bit dated, but it didn't detract from the experience.  Service was really friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I used to see this place all the time across the street from my bus stop when I would take the bus north to work.  When I switched jobs, a co-worker made mention of this place.  Years later, after finding myself in a \"What do I want for lunch, Yelp?\" moment, I decided now was the time to check this place out.  And it was totally worth the wait.  I got take-out at this place, since I was taking it to my boyfriend for his lunch break.  I ordered ahead, and was met with a super friendly staff once I got there.  The place looks a lot like Americana Grandma's kitchen--wooden walls, floral patters, silk flowers.  The place has no windows so it was kind of dim, and all of the reviews and awards in the front were circa 1990's.  The TV in the bar area was an old CRT set which, while I was there, was being replaced with a bigger CRT set.  \"Oh, is that the new TV?  ...Well, new to US, anyway,\" one of the girls said.  I laughed.  There also seemed to be nice, harmonic teamwork among the staff which made the wait feel a little more pleasant.  The portion sizes were amazing for the price.  I ordered a the freshly carved turkey and meatloaf lunches, and they're pretty much the dinner sizes just sans an extra side.  You will eat good and probably have left overs with just that alone.  I had ordered two slices of pie and drinks the (ounce) size of Polar Pops as well, and the cashier told me ordering a certain amount had earned one of the pies for free.  Now, I've had better in other places, but I have a feeling the food is purposely bland and not overwhelming for the customers that seem to go there (older population).  But if you want a good meal that has all the feeling of going to your mom's house, this is the place.  Much better than \"home-cooked styled\" places like Boston Market, and for a price that won't drive you into debt."}
{"text":"If I were rating just the pie, they would get five stars and then some.  The facility is in a not-so-spectacular part of town, and it shows both inside the restaurant and out.  The staff is friendly, although I noticed a couple of them are short a few teeth...  I have a thing with teeth.  I don't suppose it really affects most peoples' dining experience.  However, if you, like I, have a thing about teeth, be prepared.  Of the food I have eaten there, thus far, it's been of good quality.  They have a modest salad bar, complete with all kinds of tasty goodies, packed into an even more modest space; it takes up both sides of a passage to get to half the south seating area, so if you linger you might get a chance to get up close and personal with some of your fellow diners.  I haven't actually set foot in the kitchen, but I get the distinct impression that they make their own bread.  They serve small loaves of it as an appetizer with your meal.  The dough is also used to make their pizza, which my son orders every time we go there.  Oh, and the pies.  If everything that is good and right could be made into a pie, it would be these pies.  We actually started going there because My Mother's was kind enough to donate some pies to a breast cancer event my wife was taking part in, and she enjoyed the pies so much we had to eat at the restaurant to thank them and to get more pie.  That's when I got my first taste of the pie.  I can not recommend the banana cream pie highly enough.  To summarize, the place is a bit run down, nice people, decent food (although, don't go if you're watching what you eat), good bread and pies that are almost as good as sex was, back when I was younger and could do it right..."}
{"text":"We love this place! Ive had the blueberry pie and the strawberry cream pie and its definitely a to do if you love pie.  My boyfriend and I had dinner here and it is very filling! Big portions and great service! Theresa was our server and you can just tell she loves her job! She sings, whistles and dances her way over to your table and she will even crack a joke to make you laugh. Superb!  For dinner we had the Prime rib with mashed potatoes and green beans, the meat loaf with mashed potatoes and green beans, the house bread, and a trip to the salad bar complimentary with dinner. ALL YUMMY!  The salad bar has a nice variety, I like peas on my salad and fresh peas they had indeed. The bread was warm and soft and yummy. The entrees were hot and perfect the way they came, not over salted or under spiced. My boyfriends prime rib was perfectly rare just the way he likes it.  For dessert we had pie, what a great way to top off a tasty dinner! As for our check, $44. We were very surprised and pleased at the cost. We will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go check this place out after reading lots of reviews.  The food was dynamite.    One slice of pie is about a quarter of a whole one.    We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for some warm your belly, home cooked food, this is your spot! I had the open faced turkey sandwich. It was a huge portion. It was a hair dry, but great flavor. They made a yummy soup as well. Also, don't forget to add a slice of pie; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! I had the chicken fried chicken and chicken noodle soup, topped off with chocolate peanut butter mousse pie. Everything was superb. Prices were excellent; I would have paid more and am thrilled that I got to pay less. Try this place, you won't regret it.  UPDATE: Skip the prime rib. We've had it twice and felt \"meh\" about it both times. Do the chicken fried chicken. You know you want to."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some meatloaf and decided to try the one at my mother's restaurant, the first time I ordered it I absolutely loved it it was done to perfection. I I decided to have some meatloaf today so I ordered it, it was not the same it didn't taste good.  I got heartburn so bad. Needless to say... yes very disappointed. So much for consistency. I also ordered a slice of blueberry pie that was not blueberry pie. It didn't taste like blueberry pie. I also ordered a piece of pumpkin pie that was delicious."}
{"text":"The ambiance of My Mother's Restaurant is a riot of patterned fabric, antiques, and cheap prints. Chintz!   A generic salad bar is conveniently included with your entree. Nothing fancy, just filling veg and crunchy toppings. The bread that comes with your meal is warm and soft, with a charming taste of being previously frozen, just like mother used to make. (Or my mother, anyway.)  The entrees are just good plain food. I find them under-seasoned generally, but they are still wholesome and tasty. Get the turkey dinner: thick slices of turkey, with mashed potatoes, delicious green beans, and cornbread stuffing. I tend to snarf half of my turkey plate, and save the rest to make a sandwich the next day, just like Thanksgiving leftovers."}
{"text":"We bought two pies... banana cream and chocolate cream for Thanksgiving, they were excellent!"}
{"text":"this is one of my favorite places to eat.  I've only been in the actual location once but when I was there they brought out fresh loaves of bread that were amazing.  I've ordered delivery from here many times to both my work and my home and the food tastes just as good on delivery as it does when you eat in the store.  I love this place, the portions are BIG, the taste is excellent, the staff is friendly and everything on the menu is amazing.  I will eat here as long as they're open!"}
{"text":"I do love this place.  Foods is good,  service is good,  quality is great.   Dessert is not to be missed. Turkey pot pie, prime rib, lasagna are delicious."}
{"text":"This is comfort food like grandma makes. It was packed when we got there which was encouraging as it's located in a little strip shopping center. My husband had the roasted turkey dinner and loved it. I had the chicken fried chicken which was also yummy. If you want fancy, this isn't the place for you, but if you want well-made, simple food you will love it."}
{"text":"I have no idea how the meals at My Mother's taste.  I've only been there for dessert. So this review is for the pies.    There are no less than ten pie flavors available daily.  And when you ask for a slice, be prepared for a hunk of pie.  By hunk I mean a quarter of a pie.    Now if you can remember how to do fractions, a quarter means that something has been divided into four parts.  Okay, by now you're probably thinking, \"Well the diameter of the pie must be small.\"  Oh snap!  You hit me with the geometry.  I don't know the diameter of their pies, okay, because by the time I think about the measurements of the slice (just to gauge how much I've actually eaten) it's already in my stomach.    Let's just agree that it's a big slice.  Prices are decent for the amount you get, and they taste like homemade goodness."}
{"text":"If my mother ever cooked like this I would have fired her. \"My Mother's\" is bland as I am white. I had bland Lasagna with hard spice-less garlic bread and a limp side salad. The only item that saved My Mother's was the pie. The Chocolate Cream Pie (pictured) was heaven. The contrast between dinner and desert made me wonder if My Mother had someone else bake the pie."}
{"text":"Okay from me and my spouse opinion,  the wings and pizza that we order here were not good there are a lot better choices out there to get wings and pizza.  The staff was great and nice tho."}
{"text":"I've been going to My Mothers since I've been 8 years old. The food here is fantastic and the people are amazing. I love this place."}
{"text":"When they are good they are really good and the bad is actually not that bad. I've only ever eaten there once but I enjoyed the delivery countless times. My husband and I always get the open face turkey sandwiches which are a roll with turkey and gravy on top with mashed potatoes on the side-AWESOME! The cheesecakes are bomb too. The spaghetti was meh but it wasn't bad, it just wasn't that great."}
{"text":"I so much want to give 5 stars, but I can't. The 4 stars are for the food, dining room and to go service. I've only been going there for about 2 months and have always left very satisfied with food and friendliness of dining room and to go service. The price is OK. The amount of food is great. Could be construed as too much food, but I don't want to ruin that for everyone else. I like the old look and feel. My favorite kind of look. I've dined in and carried out. I've had pie, fabulous.  Here's the but. 1 particular delivery driver needs to leave his attitude problems at home. The drivers line up at the to go window waiting for their delivery food. Which is no big deal given there is not a lot of space in lobby to begin with. So I came in and stood behind what I thought was just a grumpy customer who couldn't handle waiting a few minutes. Turns out, he was a driver. Which means he is an employee, which means he represents the restuarant. Which means his even short time at the window can affect someone's viewpoint of the store. Please train or retrain this guy, that some customers notice behavior like that and remember it even if it's for less than a minute of exposure. He's a sour note on an otherwise wonderful place to eat.   I'm still going back, cause everyone else more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"Another Great Meal at \"My Mother's\" this Phoenix location, Maybe its the Salad Buffet, Maybe its the Amazing Lasagna dish Maybe its the Pie, soo good, and 1/4 slices. I really like how the restaurant is glowing with a home made feel with great food.  My mothers food is the best and 2nd best is My mother's in Phoenix.  This location is not so easy to find but once you visit it you will always know how to get back to mothers house.    The Bread offered before your meal is a nice touch and it is delicious.  Aside from the mind blowing Lasagna the turkey pot pie is great as well.  You are sure not to leave from the restaurant hungry.    Happy eating! I'll see you at My Mother's"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The portion sizes are huge and the price is not high at all. I will without question be coming here again. Next time i'll take pictures and post on here. The food was delicious and stayed warm until i got home to eat it."}
{"text":"Been past the place so many times and today thank goodness I didn't The place is homey clean great people With the outstanding leadership of Manuel I ordered the Prime Rib 8 oz with 2 sides salad bar 16.99 It came out a beautiful thick red masterpiece of beef as good as any top notch steakhouse Tasted perfect with the au jus This is my first of many trips to My mother's restaurant on 19th Ave in Phoenix Plus it's ice cold inside so Summers are fine This is the place for Lunch and Dinner any time all the time I."}
{"text":"\"D\" took me here last week, gonna make this quick atmosphere was old fashioned mom and pop restaraunt waitress was friendly and quick he ordered a draft beer and it came in the smallest glass ever I ordered the country fried steak dinner, with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob and a trip to the salad bar. Their homemade blue cheese dressing is enough to return to this place for. The country fried steak and mashed potatoes both automatically came with some creamy white gravy on it. When I tasted it,  I could tell it had bacon fat in it, and I dont eat pork, but to be honest, i couldn't stop eating my food, it was sooo good.  If you go here I do recommend the country fried steak, but if you don't eat pork, order it wihout gravy."}
{"text":"I have never eaten here only picked up or used delivery. They make the best BLT! lots of bacon, the sandwich is on a homemade roll. the only negative is they don't have avocados. Delish banana cream pie and cheese cake. If you like BLTs try this place."}
{"text":"First time here....thought the decor was adorable, in a historic sort of way and probably exactly the same as it was 35 years ago, when it first opened. Something to be said about that. Why fix what's not broken? Obviously if you are looking for 5 star quality and ambience, this is not the place for you. If you are looking for a friendly, inexpensive restaurant with decent food, a varied menu and nice service, then this is the place. 95% of the menu is made from scratch. The small salad bar is simple and fresh and a nice add-on. The pie slice is humongous. The fresh homemade bread is excellent. The mashed potaotes are real. It's comfort food and fresh pie and that's that. If you want more, you're in the wrong place!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! We have eaten here many times and food is always excellent. This is authentic homemade cooking not chain processed food. Our favorite is the prime rib sandwich and you missed the experience if you don't have either the banana or chocolate pie."}
{"text":"Love love the food and service. So much comfort and they have fast hot delivery. Mama memories felt everywhere. Servings large. Nothing but home style food"}
{"text":"This place is adorable. Pulled up by accident and it was great. The staff was so welcoming and the food was very good and at a great price. Their salad bar was fresh and the pie was amazing!!!!!! We will be back little local hidden gem...did I mention the pie was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know about you, but this is not MY mother's restaurant! Gaaaak! Something told me, even after looking at Yelp, don't do it!!! I didn't listen . The pictures on Yelp were my first warning...that is... not fresh, frozen, cardboard junk, top with gravies and sauces so you can't taste anything. I gave them a star because they delivered, that's it.  Need more, Well I called in for the prime rib dinner, pot pie, mother's pizza, and a slice of apple pie (which they threw in another slice for free), Well that's nice you may think: Until you taste the pie,  and then you realize the dough was raw (at the edge). And if that's what fresh apple pie tastes like, then I'd rather chew on expired canned apple pie filling. On the phone the man said yes our pizza dough is fresh, not frozen, bologna!  You member the frozen Tony's pizza that you used to eat as a kid?, well that is a hundred times better than this pizza !  I won't be back....EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Vaguely remembered this place from Yelp when we were looking for a lunch spot after a visit to the Acxupuncturist up the street. We pulled into the lot and by the looks of the outside, there was a bit hesitancy to go in. So, thank you to my friend's smartphone for allowing us to read the yelp reviews and allow us to take a chance on this place. I am happy to say our first visit was a good one.   Everyone has said already, it is homey and maybe a bit dated in its decor. However, I don't care for ambiance and classy settings, I care about decent food and friendly service.  MMR has both. I had the Hot Turkey lunch special for Thursdays and I have to say  it was huge for a lunch plate and the price was so reasonable. Maybe I am old school, but when you bring me hot bread and butter right after I order, you have already won me over. Then the Turkey Plate came and it was really good, moist and flavorful. The potatoes are not mashed, they are smashed-there are actually potato chunks in there. I was not thrilled with the stuffing because IMO it had too much sage (to the point of overpowering) in it and that was distracting me from what otherwise would have been a very good stuffing. There was also  MORE  BREAD given to me with my meal in the form of a roll. That was good because I needed it to dip in the copious amounts of gravy on the plate.   Mia was our server and she was really great. Very attentive, helpful and actually seemed to enjoy serving us. Rare these days. This staff has it together.    We were stuffed and decided to opt-out on dessert and take an APPLE  pie to-go. The pie was still warm when she brought us the box and it traveled well for 3 hours all the way to Marana. My friends boyfriend is  the pie lover and he had two slices after dinner that night and I can say we all loved it. I ate a slice for breakfast the next day. Excellent, excellent  pie.   Our two lunches, two beverages and a pie to go was $35, considering the pie was about 1/3 of that, not bad at all.   We go to the acupuncturist this Tuesday and I plan on getting more yumminess from MMR."}

{"text":"Good home cooked food. Servers were very friendly. Loved the cozy atmosphere. And the pie....to die for. Coconut Cream Pie is a must!"}
{"text":"My co-worker and I have this thing about \"what are we doing for lunch today\". It's a pinky and the brain banter-type of conversation we have daily. It's quite comical. So today, he opened his Urban Spoon app, shook his phone and out popped My Mother's Restaurant. Being the adventurous types that we are, we said, \"what the hell\", let's do it. He had a hankering for comfort food anyway. So off we went. I must say, first impression was: boy this place is old and country-like. The decor just takes you into the country instantly. From the time you sit down, you should have a pretty good idea of what to expect.  Then come the menus. We chose and there comes a basket of fresh, warm, wheat loaf bread.. the best I've tasted in forever. We had the lunch specials. I tried the chicken fried steak and my partner had the turkey with stuffing. It was oooohhhh sooooo yuuummmm.  I don't normally order desert, but I HAD to take a slice of apple pie back to the office so I could consume it with much joy once it cooled down (I do not like warm pie). The pie was DELISH! Well worth the 4.99 for the 1lb slice.  My partner actually got upset that we had not been to My Mother's before today. We are definitely making another trip soon.  The food came out quick, but we still ended up going just over an hour, so plan ahead if you're on a time crunch for lunch."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best. Reminded me of Furr's Cafeteria. Remember that place? The atmosphere was dark, dusty and down right creepy. Like grandma's attic.  But the pie. Oh, the pie. Chocolate peanut butter pie is to die for. The slice is as big as my head."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today right at 10:30 when they opened and would still give it 4 stars. Once again I got mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and chicken teriyaki with mashed potatoes. I declined the offer to go to salad bar for an extra $1.75. They brought out their amazing warm homemade sliced bread and I had a couple slices because yum. Then my cheesey amazingness arrived along with some marinara sauce. I had a few of the deliciously breaded cheese sticks before my meal arrived. The teriyaki chicken did not have sauce but the chicken was very moist and deliciously made with teriyaki flavor and the mashed potatoes were heavenly. Nice moist homemade goodness. After that I needed a box for the mozzarella sticks and I got a piece of chocolate peanut butter pie to go... which was amazing! $9 just about for the chicken lunch and $5 for the giant slice of pie. The minus one star is for the high prices... I think $6 or $7 max would be more appropriate for the lunch combos. But food is 6 stars at least."}
{"text":"love this place! the service & food is impeccable. come hungry tons of food & don't forget to get a slice of pie."}
{"text":"I live this place! The pizza and wings deal is amazing. My mother's restaurant is the perfect name for this place. The people who work there are so nice. Me and my boyfriend called to ordered a pizza and wings to go, unfortunately on the way there we had a minor medical emergency. Long story short we ended up getting there about an hour and a half after we were supposed to. They were so understanding and even offered to make are food fresh."}
{"text":"I work near this place and have eaten there many times for lunch love there thanksgiving dinner which includes cranberry sauce. Lasagna and salad bar is also good."}
{"text":"$20 FOR A LOAF OF BREAD!!! I was a regular customer for 15 years, mostly for bread and their pies, especially at Thanksgiving. But after a horrible experience there this past week, I will never go back. On Wednesday, I went to My Mother's to buy a loaf of whole wheat bread. The loaf costs $2.16 with tax. I gave the server a $20 bill (I had just come from the ATM) and 26 cents. We got to chatting about the bread, recipes, pie, etc., and I was not really paying attention when she gave me change--one dime, 10 cents, instead of the $18.10 I should have received. I did not notice this until the next morning when I was paying bills and only had 20s in my wallet. I dumped out my purse, searched the car and the plastic bag that my bread had come in. Nothing. I called the restaurant and talked to the person who had helped me the previous day. She told me I could come in and she would give me the money, later adding it would come out of her own wallet. I asked to speak to the manager to find out if the receipts for the previous day showed an overage. He said they did not and that I must have misplaced the change and that the server told him that she handed me three 5s and three 1s. Uh, NEVER happened. She had told me when I first talked to her that she had thought as I left that she should have counted out the money for me as they are required, but she did not, because there had been another incident where a customer said he or she did not get back the correct change. Again, she never counted out the money because she NEVER gave it to me. I festered overnight and called backed the next day, again asking for the manager. The person who answered asked what the problem was and I explained, again, plus I told her that I had not told the manager that the server had offered me the money virtually from the get-go when I first called the previous day. I told her I was very upset and could ill afford to be out $18. The person I was speaking with said the manager was not in, but took my number and said he would get back to me. I never heard from him. They won't hear from me again, either. But they also have lost my business for good and that of everyone I know. And, I am sure this is not the last time that change will mysteriously disappear. I am scrupulously honest, even to the point of telling checkers at the grocery store if they undercharge me for an item, even if it is off by a few cents. I have no motive to make this up. Crappy customer service, to say the least."}
{"text":"Just as the name implies, great home cooking and very reasonable prices. Turkey, prime rib, fish, Italian with a number of available sides. Fresh crisp salad bar w homemade dressings, fresh warm bread served with meals. Slices of pie @$4.99 ea big enough for 2. Excellent service. Busboy to cashier have first class attitudes in this restaurant. I am an out of towner definitely returning when in the area. Not the greatest neighborhood but conveniently located off I 17 N, Indian school Rd, exit 2-3 blocks to right (East) on N side of roadway.  Most recent visit I enjoyed a large perfectly Fried Chicken Fried steak w green beans, real mashed potatoes and brown gravy plus trip to salad bar for 10.99. Better half had turkey with mashed potatoes, stuffing, cranberry sauce along with real turkey gravy for $8.99 (lunch portion). Ordered slice of blueberry pie to go $4.99, literally a double portion. 2nd visit."}
{"text":"My husband was hungry for prime rib, and I yelped for it and My Mother's popped up - with great pictures from other yelpers.   When you walk in, you see the decore from the 80's.  It's clean - nothing fancy.   We were seated right away.  8pm on Saturday - it was not very busy.  I ordered open-face turkey w gravy and a side of green beans.  Tasted home-made and good!   My husband's prime rib was delicious.  Both huge portion, homemade bread, everything seems to be made from scratch.  Prices were very very reasonable.  It may not be a hip, fashionable place, but if you want some comfort and home cooked meal, this is definitely a place you should come to."}
{"text":"Ive been going to this place with my family for over 20 yrs and I still love it its our favorite place a little pricey but everything weve had is always excellent the waitresses are very nice  the only thing I would suggest that they updated or freshen it up place looks a little dingy"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Had the turkey dinner and it exactly hit the spot. Great little salad bar as well. I've heard the chicken parmesan is amazing. Will definitely have to try it on my next visit."}
{"text":"This place is all about American comfort food! The portions are HUGE! If I had an American mother this is the food I would imagine her making. Steak, turkey, prime rib! I love the turkey dinner, it's literally thanksgiving or Christmas on a plate. The bread you get before the meal is freshly baked (probably in house) and tastes like everything bread should taste like... Warm, soft and melt in your mouth with a little butter. You definitely don't come to this place for the looks, although it does give it a very homey feel, you come for the food. You never leave this place hungry. This place is on our restaurant rotation for sure."}
{"text":"Love my mothers. I have been coming since I was a kid. I first came in 1979 with my parents. Live the sausage pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered from 'My Mother's' for the first time today because I was desperate for something other then Chinese food and pizza. In fact I didn't even know they delivered to my workplace until I looked up new places on Yelp (they hadn't been there before...).  The gentleman that I spoke to on the phone while giving my order was very helpful and nice. He actually included a little sample of the mixed veggies for me to try to see if I liked them along with my meal. A+ customer service! The delivery guy was also super nice too.  The Food Lowdown:  I ordered the Pot roast lunch because I was craving something beef-y. The pot roast was tasty but fairly dry. The mashed potatoes were similar in that they were very tasty but without gravy (I don't like gravy) they were also pretty dry.  The mixed veggie sampling however was amazing! Perfectly blanched and covered in melted butter. I actually spooned the butter out and put it on my potatoes (YUMMY). I will definitely order these in the future.  In fact I'd order from My Mother's again. While things were on the dry side they were tasty and knowing that I can prepare in the future (a side of mixed veggies anyone?).   I'm looking forward to trying the turkey dinner soon.   (Delivery was reasonable, 9$ minimum and a 2.75$ delivery fee.)"}
{"text":"I went to My Mother's for dinner with a large group of family members (16), including 6 kids ranging in age from newborn to 8 years old. While the decor was generically bad \"down-home\" from the 80's, the staff was very nice and seated us in a side room with plenty of space for all of us.  The meal started with homemade bread which was warm and soft. This gave me hope that the meal wouldn't be in keeping with the general feel of the place. Alas, my hope was not long lived and I soon felt like an Obama supporter watching McCain win the election.  After ordering, I made my way to the salad bar. This seemed quaint, considering that salad bars aren't really popular anymore, unless you're at Souper Salad or Sweet Tomatoes. The salad bar was not entirely scary, but wasn't anything worth going back to. I'm fairly certain everything came out of a can, bag, bottle or box. The freshest thing may have been the red onion, which obviously had been poorly sliced by hand.  Moving on to the main course, I had Mother's Meat Loaf dinner. My meat loaf came with rice pilaf and green beans. Once again, food from cans and boxes made an appearance, as my beans were canned and my rice must have come from a box mix. The meatloaf was actually made from non-canned meat, but wasn't all that exciting. It had been cooked with ketchup slathered on top, yet was served with gravy on the side (probably originally made from a powder mix). I ate most of my dinner because I was hungry, not because of the quality.  Hoping for a come-from-behind win in a big electoral state, I ordered pie for dessert. They tout their homemade pies, but seem to think that \"homemade\" means making pie from canned ingredients. My cherry pie was not spectacular, as the preprocessed cherry filling was encased in crust which attempted to be light, flaky and buttery, but only managed to be dry and chewy.  My Mother's was saved from a one-star rating by two things...the graciousness and patience of the staff, and the low prices. For two dinners and a huge slice of pie split between my wife and I, our total bill including tax and tip was $35.  My advice is to keep your hope in homestyle cooking and stay out of My Mother's Restaurant."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place since it is near by me. I saw a lot of hit or miss reviews. Well I had a miss. Between my girlfriend and I we ordered the pot roast and father's cut prime rib. The pot roast had a flavor that was unusual, and not in a good way. The prime rib was a nice cut but dry and flavorless. The salad bar is mediocre with basic items that were at least fresh. The steak and vegetable soup also had a strange not good taste I was thoroughly disappointed. The only reason I give this place 2 stars rather than 1 is for the complimentary fresh baked wheat bread. It was pretty good with butter. They also sell the bread by the loaf."}
{"text":"We live nearby and this is a restaurant we've overlooked for awhile. We finally came in and are glad we did. Everything was delicious and the service was fast and friendly. The menu is mostly homestyle foods and we opted for the turkey and dressing dinner. We are glad we did. Everything was as good as you'd get for anything Thanksgiving dinner. We'll definitely be back to try other offerings."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to go when you want some comfort food.  It has been around for a long time and there us a reason.  It is good American food.  The chicken pot pie is really good and perfect on a winter night as is the pot roast.  The salad bar is OK.  I love the turkey dinner - it is the best.  Thw staff is always friendly and the place seems clean.  Leave room for pie because they have some nice homemade pies.   The pizza here is good too.  A keeper."}
{"text":"Chicken Fried Steak.  With brown gravy.  :drools:  I don't think there's ever a bad time to eat chicken fried steak. Or chicken fried chicken (redundant much?), for that matter.  While I normally steer clear of salad bars (an odd combination of resisting my rabbit tendencies and a major phobia of how ineffectively people bathe themselves before going into public eateries) , the salad bar at My Mother's has always been clean ad well stocked. And maybe because I feel like I'm back in the Midwest that I let go of those things that hold be back from splurging at salad bars? Perhaps. I don't eat sweets so I won't comment on the pies.  But let's move on to what's really important--the chicken fried steak.  I don't know how they make it so good, but I could eat this meal on a regular basis and never get tired of it. Crispy on the outside; moist on the inside. Just how mama used to make it...if she ever did make it. I love love love the new potatoes. The service has always been good-to-great (trying hard to remember the server's name who does it so good, and pulling blanks). And the ambiance is, well, I guess other-worldly might fit. It's not the location you'd go to and think, \"I'd love to have my commitment ceremony here. Honey, don't you think this motif would come across *darling* on film?\" But, that's not always a bad thing.  Perhaps what really draws me to this place is, as much as I hate to admit it, some times I miss home. Coming here is like being back in Fulton County and being with my family or friends at one of the local restaurants [not that we had a surplus of such]. It's everything that My Mother's is that takes me back to Ohio and reminds me of all the good things that I left.  Oh, great. I just turned a review into a pilot for Lifetime."}
