{"text":"This is what was once Hanes in Lower Burrell. I wasn't aware of this when I purchased a Groupon deal, $40 worth of food for less than $20. Sounded good, great way to try a new place.
Checked the online menu and ordered a Gyro Platter for dinner (delicious) and two of their specialty pizzas for weekend snacking. Their meat lovers was awfully spicy with an overabundance of spicy tomato sauce and was lacking in cheese. Their veggie pizza was not edible. It was a pizza crust with tomatoes, peppers and spinach on it. No sauce, no cheese; also in the description was black olives and broccoli, neither were present either.
Ok, the kitchen made an error. But, the waitress/hostess/cash register operator who took my payment made me feel as though I was robbing her personally by redeeming the Groupon. Now, after bringing food home, I am gobsmacked at what was in that veggie pizza box. I called the store and spoke with the all-purpose girl once again. After a lengthy explanation, she told me she would put me \"in the book\" for a future order.
I took pictures of this crust/veggie thing.
The next day we decided to order our new pizza. I called, was placed on hold then the call abruptly ended. I called back again and spoke with a woman who said \"hold on, let me check the book\". When she returned, she stated that \"she had to get to the bottom of this. the girl who made you that promise (of another pizza) had no right to do that - every shift I receive calls of people complaining about their food and just wanting free food - and that girl gives credit out without any authority. and, you used a groupon so you already got your free food. after all, we don't make any money off of this\". Excuse me? I said that Groupon is $40 of food, nothing was free. If you receive calls every shift from people complaining about their food, did you ever consider that you have a problem in the kitchen?
I forwarded her the pictures that I took and she returned my call, saying that she agreed that my pizza was \"messed up\" and we could pick up another.
After a 15 mile drive, we had to wait 25 additional minutes as they \"just put it in the oven\".
This pizza was delicious. But, after an awful experience like this, especially since they made me feel like a thief for using a Groupon, I will never ever return."}
