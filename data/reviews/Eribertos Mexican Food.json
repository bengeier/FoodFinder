{"text":"Greasy, fresh, should make you feel better \" buzzed food\" to absorb all the alcohol. 
Similar to Federico's, filibertos, Ramiro's, Etc.... Fast and friendly and pretty decent."}
{"text":"We were pulled in by 99 cent tacos...Mon/Tues/Wed!!...then tried rolled tacos with GREAT guacamole. ..everything so far has been super, they're open 24/7, and Patio or drive thru both great options!!"}
{"text":"The wife and I just went there for lunch.  I got the adobada burrito and she got the taco plate.  Both were vey good. Way better than senor taco down the street. I'll be going to Elibertos from now on"}
{"text":"24hr Quick Mexican food??? How can you go wrong?! Think out side the box and try something you haven't before. I went for the Arizona Burrito. It was well made, great tortilla and held together until the end. Right down the street from me, I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite taco restaurant in Arizona. Our out if state friends always insist on eating there. You have to take out or eat on the patio, so check the weather. We've been eating here for over 20 years."}
{"text":"Good & fast food. Prices are fair. They charge a fee for Bank cards."}
{"text":"Two Drive Thrus? 24 hours? Happy to help you customer service? Is that what you are looking for? 
Run don't walk to Eribertos! I have tried almost everything from this place.  All hot, tasty delicious.
I am a big fan of their rolled tacos. And the hot sauce! THE HOT SAUCE is amazing.
But hey, that's just me go try for yourself!"}
{"text":"Their super nachos are amazing, AZ burrito is pretty good too. The night time lady that works there is super unfriendly, but I don't expect much from a place like that in terms of service. The food is always good, and always the same, which is what I depend on."}
{"text":"Monday night I was craving carne asada so I stopped by Eribertos drive thru, since it has been at least a year since I last came here. They really need to fix the lil speaker you order through, I can never understand what they're saying! Any way, I ordered a quesadilla & a #8 for my hubby, which is carne asada tacos w/rice & beans, & myself a carne asada burrito w/rice & beans added inside of it. When I pull up to pay I notice a sign w/all their dessert choices. The tres leche cake looks yummy so I order 1 of those & pay w/cash since I already paid for our dinner w/my card. After I paid, the girl working the window informs me the only dessert they have left is cheesecake. I really don't want it but I already paid so I say it's fine. I am waiting almost 10 minutes for my food, which is a tad annoying, but honestly at least it's fresh. My burrito was good & not too big of a portion like some places. Hubby enjoyed his quesadilla, tacos & rice & beans as well, definitely made 2 meals out of it. The cheesecake was not very good & I only ate about half & tossed the rest. Not sure how soon I will be back b/c they are way overpriced for what it is, I spent over $21!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at this joint on and off for 12 years now and I can honestly say that their Carne Asada burrito is the absolute bomb.  The Super Nachos come in a close second tied with the three rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole.  I have tried some of the other \"bertos\" out there but this is hands down the best of the lot.  Stay away from Los Betos."}
{"text":"Best one of all of them 
I always go here if I want a quick bite
Better then most fast food Mexican food shops"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast burritos are here. So good! They make the best potatoes for them out of anywhere. They load it up big too."}
{"text":"I work nearby and sometimes very late. My late night choices in the area for a hot meal are limited. I've been here several times and my go to meal is the beef fajitas or number 21...don't laugh. Now it strongly resembles the carne asada plate number I don't remember but that's fine...both are good and served with two steaming hot tortillas and rice and beans. Some green salsa and iced tea and I'm set all for $12.10! Don't forget a fork.
Now Whataburger is nearby and open late but I don't feel all gross and regretful after eating my number 21 plate."}
{"text":"Great little place! Had the huevos rancheros and it was outstanding! Clean place with 6 tables and clean bathrooms! Recommended!"}
{"text":"The food is great! And I really love the breakfast burritos. My only qualm is that it's pricey for what you get and its a long wait in the drive thru. But great tasting food 24-7 is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"Used to be a good location. But I'm actually quite disgusted with how low quality the food is. You go there for authentic greasy and heartwarming Mexican food, not bowel disturbing moldy avocado. Spoiler alert, I got bowel disturbing moldy avocado."}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars, I would.  I've been here 2 times and both times I received the worst service imaginable.  The first time the drive thru attendant was on his phone!  Literally having a conversation with a buddy while taking my credit card.  The second time, the drive thru attendant looked at me like I had no business there.  He was rude and rolled his eyes when I asked questions about the menu.  Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"DO NOT go to this place. They stole our credit card info!!!!
It is very sad we have to deal with thieves!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years love love love this place. Love their fish tacos shredded beef tacos breakfast burritos and super nachos w carne Asada. I heard they have there own farm so meat taste WAY better than average. I've never had a bad experience here. I come here a couple times a week. Great service as well. Churros are yum. Can't go wrong with anything here. They have daily taco specials as well. :-D"}
{"text":"the only two items i have sampled at eribertos have been the huevos rancheros,which i really liked. plus, they give you 3 overmedium eggs, instead of 2 scrambled..which is to my liking. the beans do no have much flavor, nor does the rice, but the pico de gallo and ranchero sauce more than make up for it.  the other dish i;ve had are the nachos with carne asada. also filling and fun to eat. other items i would choose to eat at other close by, higher end restaurants. i do check the health ratings, and while the county was doing them, they fared ok. but it's definitely a take out joint..no place you want to eat in."}
{"text":"Don't look----just eat.  Don't think---just eat. 

Oh, I hate those silly cleanliness thoughts that come through my head.  Will this place kill me?  

Good food.  I mean, we are not talking haut cuisine here.  But, sometimes, you just want deep fried fish in your burrito.  Really good.  I hope it won't kill me...."}
{"text":"It looks like a gross cafeteria, the bathroom is disgusting, but I'll hand it to this place: they've never screwed up my order.  It's also 24 hours and close to downtown.  So...I'm not going to complain.  A burrito is a burrito, more or less."}
{"text":"Still a great fast stop!  We are not usually fast food eaters but there's that rare time when nothing will cut it but a -bertos!!!  I love the carne asada burrito here.

Also they have a double drive through here!"}
{"text":"Love this place around Christmas time. Champurrado and tamales are delicious. I make the drive from west Glendale for them."}
{"text":"Always good food here and big portions. The burritos are huge! Plus it's 24hrs when most places are closed in central Phoenix. I much prefer Eribertos some of the others around."}
{"text":"I grew up in the Midwest. I thought that Taco Bell was bee's knees and Chi Chi's really was a celebration of food. Moving to Arizona more than a decade ago, my journey through the realm of burritos, tacos and horchata has taught me so much. SO MUCH. 
This is my neighborhood joint, I end up here pretty regularly. I find them reliably tasty and fast, with a side of affordability. Their breakfast burritos are hearty, but not too greasy or heavy. My personal favorite burrito is the shrimp burrito. Don't expect oceanside-fresh shrimp, we are definitely landlocked, but the sauce is lovely. My mom approves of the fish tacos as well.
I am a big fan of the horchata, it is sweet and light and refreshing. And they stay true to the horchata roots and stick with rice milk. Which my lactose intolerant body appreciates.
This place is far from fancy, but it is comfortable and satisfying."}
{"text":"this place is by far my guilty pleasure. I work nights and I often find myself getting tacos or a chimi after my long work shifts. Employees are always friendly and their food is so yummy ! Its also in a really great location! will keep coming back"}
{"text":"If you are looking for fresh, quick, and delicious Mexican food you need to check this place out! Its fast and you will feel at home. It is a local business so check it out...take friends n family with you!! You will be greeted by Marcela and enjoy Tony's good food."}
{"text":"I wish I could say that my meal was good but it just wasn't. The food was overcooked and didn't have a good taste.  Maybe I will give it some time and then give it another try. 

I do have to say that the service was good."}
{"text":"It's ok, food was cold.  I ordered the beef and chicken tacos and both actually tasted like fish.  Don't think that is a good thing.  Prices are decent and had the $1 taco special and they were average at best."}
{"text":"They have $1 tacos deals everyday and they were pretty good to be a dollar!! Ill be back"}
{"text":"I always get the chorizo breakfast burrito with a side of sour cream. Always comes to me piping hot but the sour cream cools it down, food is always serving for 2 so I save the other half for the next morning. The burrito holds up the next day. I don't dare use the bathroom and the claw machine is broken but the staff is friendly. Cream filled churros are delicious."}
{"text":"Carne asada tacos, carne asada fries.  Rolled tacos,etc
Mon-wed beef,ground beef,chicken tacos are $1."}
{"text":"Not the healthiest place to eat, I'm assuming you know that when pulling up to the drive thru. Also, it's extremely over priced for fast food Mexican. For what you pay for you mightiest well go to Mi Patio and have a full dining experience. Lastly, NEVER get chicken from this it's horrible!!! I repeat the chicken is horrible!!!"}
{"text":"my entire family loves this place!..tacos are 1$ on mon, tues and Wednesday.  We've tried a lot of different spots and this is by far one of the very best!  We have tried many different menu choices and have not been disappointed one time....AND since I've first written my review 7 months ago, my family and I still love this place..We recently placed an order for 4 dozen tamales for thanksgiving...they were delicious..made fresh, wrapped perfectly, and tasted amazing !  Tony is not only a great cook, he is a great guy also...stop in and say hi and order a little something...you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"BEWARE 
Do not go here will steal your money!! Used to go here all the time especially since it's open 24hrs. Went there a few months ago about 1am and ordered a pretty big order for a group of friends totally was about $35 I paid with card and when I got the receipt back he charged me $80!!! When I told him to refund my money back he pretended he didn't understand me and only spoke Spanish! Then he gave me another receipt showing the correct amount. 
I was charged both the $80 and the $35! They steal your money!!"}
{"text":"soooo love me some Eribertos. We used to frequent here for the best breakfast burritos around before we moved to South Mountain.. When we decided to move back up here, we just by chance bought a house right across the street! They're open 24 hours, and have a drive through (although it's hard to find, you have to drive behind the dry cleaners to find it) The Carne Asada is awesome, the Carne Asada Fries are teh ULTIMATE drunk food and I finally tried their menudo last weekend and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Great quick service, super fresh great food and super cheap makes it a triple threat...and the 24 hour plus drive through doesn't hurt the cause.."}
{"text":"I go there often I like the food.   However the last time I went a couple weeks ago I got my old standby the Arizona burrito.  This time it was so bad I had to throw it out.  Dried out nasty.    Like it had been sitting there for a day.   I haven't been able to go back there because I keep thinking of that meal I had. It just ruined it for future visits. It could have been just a one time thing every restaurant has a bad day. But I was so turned off I didn't go back and probably never will. I normally would've given it four stars but not anymore"}
{"text":"Perfect drunken midnight snack! Five stars for the night crawlers, but I cannot say as much for the place when I am sober.

The interior is very much so a low end fast food restaurant. After all, it is a very casual Mexican fast food restaurant. The staff is nice, the homemade drinks are okay at best, and the good isn't half bad.

I would highly recommend the deluxe quesadilla as a late night snack. If you are dinning in during the day I would be more adventurous and see what else is good on the menu. They have a lot of options.  The other dishes I have tried were all pretty good and very filling.

They also have dessert in the for of frozen ice cream. Most of the treats are pretty typical but I am a big fan of the Mexico Ice Cream Bars. A must try if you have any room after you meal."}
{"text":"I love that they don't mind doing special orders. My favorite low carb treat is the Carne Asada plate with no beans, no rice and add scrambled eggs. The lettuce, pico and guacamole makes an amazing steak and egg salad. Thanks Juan!

I love all their food but I just don't understand the red hot sauce they use. Having grown up in the Valley Mexican hot sauce in these parts has more of a Mexican oregano flavor. When the introduction of the \"Berto\" drive through's they introduced new hot sauces we had never experienced in these parts. These new hot sauces are based in chile japones or arbol. Some have an olive juice overtone (Los Betos) and quite tasty but many brands like Eribertos has a bitter unsavory flavor and I just don't get it. If I could get this quality food with an old fashioned traditional Sonoran Hot Sauce I would come here over other competitors."}
{"text":"This place is really good Mexican food from pollo to carne asada. I haven't had anything that I didn't like. The only thing keeping this place from a 5 star fast food Mexican joint is more often than not, they take a bit longer to hand you your food than you would think be necessary.

It's one of the good ones."}
{"text":"Am I guilty of stumbling in here at 3a.m after a long night of drinks and fun with my Phoenix pals? You know it! This place is just your average, greasy, late-night burrito joint. I don't particularly care for their burritos and their tacos aren't even worthy of crossing the AZ border into CA...the land of great tacos. However, DAMN THEIR AWFUL BUT AMAZING CARNE ASADA FRIES. It's exactly what you (drunk) people want and need. Fries, mystery meat, cheese, guac, and all that sinful stuff for $6.Worthy of about  two stars, but  I won't lie.. when there is NOTHING open past 11PM in Phoenix and you are so so sick of 5 N' Diner and IHOP...nearly every person I know who goes to shows downtown has made a pit stop here."}
{"text":"Excellent drive through service, the food was quickly prepared as well as delicious. I ordered the Carne Asada fries which was a great meal for my two stomaches. The tomatoes were fresh, the guacamole smooth, and the carne plentiful. 

My mother ordered a bacon breakfast burrito as well as a chicken burrito for her sister. No confusion in unwrapping the whole burrito to figure out which one was which because after undoing the wrapper a little piece of bacon came to say \"Hello this is the bacon burrito!\". Would visit again!"}
{"text":"I like this place for tacos and burritos...it's nothin' fancy but sometimes one needs a drive-thru and food that actually tastes good.  I've stumbled upon the American Burrito, which has potatoes, cheese, and some other yummy ingredients and is also big enough for a couple of meals.  They also serve homemade chips which are really hitting the spot right now!  The staff doesn't speak much English but are pleasant to those who are kind to them.  This place is open 24 hours, 7 days a week.  I don't go there often but today was one of those times."}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here amazing carne Asada dollar tacos! Good size great flavor! The pico is so friggen good! Also the enchiladas are friggen amazing! But my all time favorite item on the menu is the munchers they are cheese jalapeño potato bites and omggggg to die for! Great with sour cream and red sauce! Staff is usually pretty amazing we have become quite the regulars I never seem to catch her name but the cashier with the short hair and glasses is always the sweetest and we prefer to go when she's there, but there is also another young women with long. Blonde hair who is very sweet and kind and always gets the order right for our picky family! Only two things we don't like is we are not given a total at the speaker box which really isn't that big of a deal and that a large drink is 2.29 lol"}
{"text":"Drive thru review: I ordered a shrimp burrito and nachos.  The total was ~$18 and I added $2 tip (again, drive thru).  I got home and discovered that I was given a shrimp burrito and a styrofoam container of plain chips.  No nacho toppings.  Basically I paid $11 for a box of chips.  Learn from my mistake: check order before driving home.  The burrito was fine, but not worth $20 - even with a side of plain unsalted chips - from a drive thru."}
{"text":"Terrible service, every time. I do keep going back to get bean burritos for my sister in law on lazy Sundays, and it's always an ordeal. The one star is for the competence of making my food correctly, and nothing else. Waited 20 minutes or so just to get the guy to take my order, which never actually happened. So I pulled up to the window and was received with a look like I was bothering the gentlemen on who was inside. I asked to make an order and he proceeded to tell me I needed to get back in line and order at the menu in the drive thru. I told him I had been waiting as he slammed the sliding window shut in my face. I left with a bad taste in my mouth, and no food."}
{"text":"They are so nice and this place is so good! 24 hours which is perfect for when I get off of work. Don't let the inside or outside fool you, the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service at an affordable price!!! Place was spotless and staff was very friendly. Definitely will be back!!! Huge portions!!!"}
{"text":"I love their fish tacos and beef tacos! Everyday for $1!!!! They're so good and way better than any fast food joint like Taco Bell. Their salsa is weak, super watery, but their tacos are solid. So are their bean and rice burritos."}
{"text":"Decided to grab a few tacos here tonight. Really good deals on their tacos. They have $1 tacos almost everyday of the week. I'm a big supporter of small ma and pop shops so I had to try this place out. Tony the owner was very accommodating and pleasant. I had some shredded beef tacos, fish tacos and carne asada tacos. They were all tasty and surprisingly bigger than expected for the price of only $1 each!! Good bang for your buck. I definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I went to this place with family. The service was ok and food was ok but I had a rice water in a large sized cup. The beverage was full of cinnamon at first I was really thirsty so I thought nothing of it. When I got home about 3 hours later I thought I was having a mental breakdown. My head felt weird like I was losing my mind... In short I did some research online and it says that cinnamon is a mild hallucinogenic like ecstasy. So I don't know if it was the drink or the food. I will not be going back to this place ever."}
{"text":"One of the many \"-bertos\" in Phoenix... this one is pretty good especially late at night. They make very good carne asadas. It's not the best but as with any fast food chain, sometimes things vary. The first time I was here it was excellent. This time, the burito I got was on a stale tortilla. Even though it's not perfect, I would go again. Good food for the price."}
{"text":"I pull up and order a California burrito made with CHICKEN not STEAK.

It's after work and I'm HANGRY. (Hungry plus angry.) 

I wait in the drive up line for what seems like forever wish I had chosen to go elsewhere but looking forward to the cheese and the fries and the chicken that are about to arrive all wrapped up in my burrito.

I ask the girl to make sure.

\"This is a california burrito with CHICKEN right!? Not with steak.\"

She says yeah and I hear her ask the cooks in Spanish.

I get my piping hot burrito. Too hot to eat so I drive it home.

ITS NOT A CALIFORNIA BURRITO AT ALL!!!

It's chicken with onions. That's it!

No cheese, no fries. 

Nothing I wanted.

I want my 7 dollars back.

How hard can it be!?  

WTF!?  Aaaaaaahhhhhh."}
{"text":"This is 4 stars as compared to other xxxxbertos. I would consider this one better than Filly B's or Tulio. Great Arizona Burrito. Clean and friendly. You get what you expect and their food doesn't give me digestion problems like Filly B's."}
{"text":"The food was good and would be rated higher if they could ever get my GD order right.  I do not like finding a beef burrito when I order fish tacos.  Not even similar."}
{"text":"I always judge a place by their tacos. I've never ever had tacos this bad before. We threw most away, just inedible. The meat was so overcooked. We tried all 3 varieties, all bad! The shells were all broken making them hard to eat! The shredded beef was barely there, and very little lettuce and cheese. The water tasted terrible. We ate here at lunch time and the place was empty, should have scared us away! Honestly yelp you failed me by your posting. We will never be back! The one star is for the man who took our order and cooked our food. I can make better tacos at home and I guess I will be doing that rather than eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure about all the lesser reviews but this place is a favorite of mine. It's close by so I frequent it whenever I get the chance. The service is great because over the years,  with all the big orders, they have never gotten a single thing wrong! Always exactly what I want and cooked how we like it. The hours are incredible just like all the \"Berto's\" in the city and they have two drive-thru lanes. They have an awesome staff that never changes, outdoor seating (with a TV) and come on...THEY NEVER CLOSE! All the people I bring here from out of town love it. Definitely worth a shot. Plus you can't beat the prices.

Try the breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"It took Eribertos to pull me out from behind the rock I've been hiding for the past few months in regards to writing reviews, and for that Eribertos, I tip my hat. The unfortunate reality is that it took such slow service on a Sunday morning for me to care enough to think about leaving a review. I got in the drive through line behind two other cars, waited a few minutes and three more cars had arrived in line behind me. After 10 minutes of waiting, I was ready to leave but unfortunately could not move forward, nor could I move in reverse because of the cars behind. I was stuck and was in a hurry to get somewhere else. I was third in line when I pulled up and the time I left the drive through window with food in hand was exactly 27 minutes later. 

This is not the first time they've taken a \"long\" time in the drive through, I've seen maybe 15 minutes before which I thought was long, but this last visit really takes the cake. By the time I had gotten to the end I saw at least two other cars, who weren't blocked in, reverse their way out of the drive through and leave. I'm obviously not the only one who was annoyed this morning.

Eri, this isn't table service, there's no reason that an order of one bacon egg and cheese burrito should take 27 minutes to fill. You guys are just so super slow. This will definitely be the last time I visit, there's just way to many other 'bertos' choices within two miles that seem to have their stuff together."}
{"text":"just had to write a quick review. again about his place.... couldent say enough great things about them, great food and great staff....dont miss out on the best food in phoenix..."}
{"text":"MEH... 1st time here, had 2 chicken tacos... It's OK. Service is fast and friendly. Portions are big. The beans are a little runny.
A HUGE plus is that they have NO violations with the health department. Very unusual for this type of restaurant. I wish l could give half stars, I'd do 2.5, but you live by the full star you die by the full star. 
Also this place has NO broads working here."}
{"text":"Great service! Yummy smelling food. Love late hours!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of most ***bertos type joints. I occasionally enjoy having lard drip down my chin after biting into a questionable beef taco...       NOT HERE. 

The oil very obviously hadn't been replaced in who knows how long. It was pure sickness. I am not a picky eater by any stretch. Growing up with little $ has it's perks in that way. Something has to have zero redeeming qualities for me to not just eat it anyway.

I usually love fish tacos at places like this but these were fucking awful, not crispy, sauce tasted like straight mayo tacos from Hades.      blech!
I won't return. I'm taking a long break from any ***bertos as well after this experience. My heart and cholesterol levels thank you Eribertos."}
{"text":"l live just down the street from here and my sister wanted some quick mexican food so we made a stop here. We ordered the carne asada burrito, the wait took a bit long but the staff was nice. We enjoyed our burritos and it was definitely delicious! Or I thought, I usually eat \"healthy\", cook my own meals so I rarely get take out food, especially mexican food. It is now 4:30AM and I woke up feeling the worst! I been throwing up for the past 15 minutes and a bad tummy ache. I'm not sure if it's bad food preparing or just my tummy being sensitive to fried food but at this point, it sucks! I will check up on my sister later today to see how she feels. For now on I honestly will not be ordering from here ever again even though their food is delicious.
UPDATE! 7/6/17 @ 8:41AM - I been having horrible tummy aches which resulted to diarrhea. I can't hold anything down so I end up throwing up, also when I throw up there's little bloody chunks with the taste of grease. The middle of my chest right below my breast hurts so much when I need to throw up. I also have the aches and chills. This has resulted me on going to the hospital to find out if I got food poisoning."}
{"text":"I go to this pace for fish tacos, that's all I buy from here. They are delicious and each one is large enough that you only have to order one. It's under $4 for a fish taco, served on 2 soft corn tortillas (oversized) also with onions and cilantro and cabbage.  I request green sauce and fresh lemons which I add to the taco. totally delicious and fresh. I don't know what kind of fish they use but never had a fishbone in the tacos.  I drive through, don't have to get out of the car. Great for me. Convenient. Use cash because if you use plastic to pay, they add $.50 on to your order. Great fish tacos!"}
{"text":"Delish!  This is the third time I've gone through the drive through!  The portions are BIG!  The food is pretty authentic tasting to me!  Best after bar food!  24 hrs too!  I had the bacon breakfast burrito today.   So much chunkey bacon and cheese!  Oh, and the Green Chili is pretty darn good too."}
{"text":"Still the best after all these years. Been going here for 20+ years.  I live in Philadelphia now and miss this place. Nothing like it out east. It's a must go to place every time I'm back in town. Carne asada burrito is the best."}
{"text":"This place does steal your money! I ordered 2 burritos and 2 sides of beans. He gave me the large beans but I asked for a 2 sides of beans which are only .85 cents NOT 2.35 each for the large!! After I asked about it and asked for my money back he pretended to not know what was going on. 
I told him I didn't want the large size beans. I held out my hand with the bag to return them and askex for the side of beans and a refund. He Snatched the bag back with attitude and switched the beans and handed me $2 back in cash. Uhhh NO dude... It's $4..
It was such a hassle that I said forget it and drove off. DO NOT GO. This place sucks!!!!!"}
{"text":"SO I love me some 'Bertos' anything since Ive moved into the valley... all the Bertos confuse me.. is it Filibertos? Because Im confused.. well, maybe its a blonde thing I just dont get.. BUT this aint NO Filibertos, yo.. 
I went to EriBertos this morning.. as I have a few times before since moving to North Phoenix.. First.. S L O W.. secondly, can we say H A I R in my food.. ugh! Nothing worse.. okay.. stomach is turned.. and money is wasted.. I guess I didnt need huevos rancheros anyway.. but when that kind of negligence takes place.. it doesnt deserve even a one star.. boo Bertos!"}
{"text":"This place has NEVER failed me! Even when I was pregnant and sick, I could eat Eribertos! The staff is always courteous and so sweet! Food is prepared quick but is always steeping hot. They always offer sauce and will LOAD YOU UP without charge. Everything I've ever had here is amazing. Highly recommend the nachos! Their meat is always tender and perfectly flavorful. My two-year old even loves everything here! They even have dessert and of course horchata. They seem to always be open as well and there's never a huge wait. I've never eaten outside, but they have a nice outdoor area!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  Food is very good and reasonably priced.  Dollar tacos three days a week can't be beat!  We go here quite often."}
{"text":"To sum it up, just another generic xxxxBertos you insert the prefix.

The menu is what you would expect from a this type of place, burritos, combo plates, enchiladas, tacos. Prices are on par too, but they lack the free chips some places do have.

The one slightly unique thing here is the vintage arrcade games they had in back. Including Mortal Kombat 2 and the simpsons."}
{"text":"Very small place, hidden inside a tiny plaza by Corte Sierra. We went in the other day and was greeted by a younger man. The owner came out also and conversed with us, he was very nice. He suggested the beef tacos (it's $1 tacos every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday I believe) - IT WAS SO GOOD! This will definitely be our new go-to spot."}
{"text":"I love the convenience of Eribertos. I live across the street and call in my order, he always has it ready for me. I support local small businesses, this is one that absolutely love! I love how delicious the food is the guacamole, two different salsas my go to is absolutely the menudo and the machaca burrito! I love that it's family owned as well, makes me feel great knowing I am enjoying some family recipes!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around!  I'm so glad I found this place.  Try the Arizona burrito, you won't regret it. The owner is friendly and personable."}
{"text":"Not bad. Food tastes fresh and prices are ok. The 24 hour thing is a life saver. However I do want to warn people that the burritos that appear to be vegetarian (veggie, green chile, etc), are actually full of pig lard. The beans that go in EVERY burrito have lard. Just in case anyone is a vegetarian. 

Otherwise, it's really a good alternative to other chain Mexican places."}
{"text":"Went here the other day for the last time. I came to get a breakfast burrito and a drink and when I pulled up to the window I saw 3 roaches on the drink lids. Then I literally watched the guy put the same lid on my drink! I told him that I no longer wanted my food and drove off. I told my friend and he told me that he once found a dead roach in his actual taco from this place. Will never come here agin."}
{"text":"Drive through takes forever in the morning 20 minutes for one burrito. Egg Shells in my Carne Asada Burroito after I waited forever  :("}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this location. I received a lot of food for my money but the food is just okay... I love Mexican food and this place is just cranking it out without any real quality. The service was fine and I did not think it took long to wait for my food. I'm passing on this one."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Eribertos. The restraunt is small with about 6 tables to dine at. The staff is friendly and accomdating, and thats why I feel terriberible having to say the food just wasn't very good.

On this visit we ordered chips/salsa, beef tacos, a beef burrito, and a carnitas burrito. The salsa/chips were okay. I was disappointed with the carnitas burrito as I was with the beef burrito,  the meat was somewhat dry and slightly overcooked. The burritos are packed full of meat but lacked any other ingredients. I think the burrito would have been flavorful had it had a little more pico de gallo and seasoning as would the beef burrito.

The pricing is very wallet friendly, you can get a better Mexican meal, but you'll have a hard time getting more food for the price."}
{"text":"Good.  Cheap.  Tasty.   24/7.  Drive through.   That sums this place up.  

Highlights: 

Their Carnitas platter comes in a styrofoam plate with beans, rice, and two giant tortillas, weighs quite literally 2 lbs, and is enough to put two people to sleep for a little more than 7 dollars.  Now that's bang for your buck.  

Taquitos plate - at 4.50 - also good.  Burritos of all sorts but stay away from the fish.  Carnitas is probably the best.  Asada is a little gristly but good.  Barbacoa not bad.  Breakfast is quite tasty too.  Asada Fries will put you down for the count. 

But you're not paying for a glamorous atmosphere - or heat on a cold day, so don't expect it. 

I'd recommend it for a late nights, when you're really hungry"}
{"text":"Great food, super fast. This location is incredibly clean and inviting. Staff is nice and friendly. Definitely come!"}
{"text":"Every single time we have been to Eribertos, its been delicious, in fact, as i sit here writing you, i am craving it! We have been to many \"bertos\" but this is the best!.  I like the #2, two shredded beef tacos with rice and beans, love it.
My Alex likes the Chorizo, Egg, Potato and Cheese Breakfast Burrito. 
Not sure what is up with some of the other reviews, but we really love their food here at this location. With the other 4/5 star reviews, you have great taste. You get it.  They have made many changes by adding a nice outdoors patio to eat at and two drive-thru windows. That's how busy they are. We will be back and i strongly suggest you try it, i think you will like it."}
{"text":"It was my first time going and the gentleman helped me pick a good chimichanga. He provided great customer service and since I'm picky with my food he customized my order to my taste. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly good. It is not cheap nasty tummy ache diarrhea hard meat Mexican food. The food is clean and tasty. Also authentic.

I get the same thing every time mostly. Soft Asada taco. Now I'm starting to get the hard Asada tacos, THEY ARE SOO GOOD! The taco shells are delicious! I never get guacamole, never. I always ask for lemons. I also get the quesadilla with light cheese. They are also surprisingly good! This restaurant is a hidden secret and the employees are nice for the most part. 

And don't forget to get a Jarritos Tamarind to drink!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great but service is terrible! They always treat you like an inconvenience! Super rude staff at the drive thru. Management needs to hire more friendly people."}
{"text":"Open 24hrs 99cent beef fish Carne asada tacos how can you go wrong. I am a fan of a 10pm Taco binge on friday nights and this place never let's me down. Its always fresh hot and tasty. I usually get 1 of each 99cent tacos well 2 most the time cuz I'll eat some the next day. Shredded beef and carne asada tacos are my weakness."}
{"text":"This place was open when I was in dire need on Christmas Day. Food was great and the service was wonderful."}
{"text":"This is my favorite 'bertos.  It doesn't hurt that it is conveniently located near my home and school, so I can have it coming or going.

The 24 hour service 365 days a year make this place a standout. It also doesn't hurt that the staff is super friendly and will happy take your 'when Harry me Sally' style order.  Prices are cheap and unlike others, I've never had an issue with slow drive through service.

The nachos are my favorite thing on the menu.  When they pass the bag to me it must weigh close to two pounds.  The clam shell could not hold one more ounce and if it were not for the extra red and green hot sauces that I always request because I like my food spicy, I swear that the lid would not have a chance of staying closed.  I also like the cheese enchiladas.  They aren't nice restaurant good but they aren't bad and a great choice for non-meat eaters.  My BIL loves the carne asada  here and I'm pretty sure he's tried just about every 'bertos in the city.

If you're in the area and you need a quick eat, this place is clean... the food is good... and the staff is friendly. Give Eribertos a try (even if it's at 3:30 in the morning).  :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a carnitas burrito and there was more onion in this burrito then there is anything else. I literally bit into my burrito and had an uneven taste of onion versus the tomatoes and meat that was in it. After three bites, I could not take it anymore. There was so much onion in this burrito, that it practically ruined everything else that was in this supposedly \"carnitas burrito\" .I'm not the biggest fan of onions, but I can usually handle it on burritos and tacos, come on I'm Hispanic.(onions are essential in our recipes) I paid $7.60 for this burrito, that  I ended up throwing away because it had too much onion and it was not the tastiest. I'm definitely not coming back again and I don't recommend it to anyone, nor am I ever returning to this restaurant, or any related chain."}
{"text":"Just amazing. Nothing less than the best food that had ever entered my mouth. Holy crap! This is amazing!"}
{"text":"Aye chihuahua!

So I'm mucho hambre and it's Christmas at 10pm on a Sunday. Bad combination for finding food out there. 

But lo, I see a shining beacon. Is it the North Star leading me to the new born Baby Jesus? 

NO! It's Eriberto's! Praise the Lord God Almighty!

Arriba, arriba!

I had the California burrito which is potato, cheese, pico de gallo and meat. I ate half of it and somehow it changed from burrito to brick somewhere between my mouth and my poor stomach. 

Would I return? Um... No."}
{"text":"Great customer service, food has good flavor and the prices are fair.  The location itself could use a facelift.  The 24 hour drive-thru is a plus!"}
{"text":"Food is overpriced and Poor in quality and taste. 
It was late and we were hungry this place was the nearest  option. I got the rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese and they were still cold on the inside when I took a bite 
My housbands carne asada burrito was rolled in a wet tortilla... customer service is very Poor also 
Def not coming back , ever ."}
{"text":"When it comes to figuring out which Berto to go with by default my local spot is Erirbertos ! Typical taco stand mainly for drive-thru purposes only! Only downfall I would say is that even though the food is hot and fresh ordered the food does take a long minute to be prepared while you wait in your car. Expect long ones during dinner hours but expect delicious flavors !"}
{"text":"Huge breakfast Burrito!  7.64 but well worth it. Added cheese, bacon & potatoes to my sausage and egg!!  This hit the spot!  Already been there twice in the last 3 days!!!  They were also wearing gloves which is always a plus!  Very friendly staff!  Same girl helped me both times!  Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Yooo this place takes! i suggest eating this food.  cus what else u gonna do for dinner bruh? i suggest it, so good. im addicted to the green sauce. i really have a hard time thinking clearly with such incredibly strong cravings for the fucking green sauce. which is odd because i always mix the green and red. kindof a \"who is the real hero\" deal. anyway. breakfast burrito & california burrito both go so hard. period. if youre coming here to eat someplace nice, fuck off. its good food, sort of shitty inside but dont act like you wash your dirty ass sheets every day anyways. love it"}
{"text":"This place authentic with food made to order.  My husband and I order super nachos.  While we waited they gave us chips and salsa.  Very hospitable....we will be back!!"}
{"text":"A 24 hour taco stand sure comes in handy when the bars close and you want any place to eat that doesn't start with Denny's! It's quite greasy and filling to help soak up the evening's adventures. Plus the 2am crowd is interesting!"}
{"text":"Since my last review I've been here several times and each time has been a disappointment.  The chicken is near inedible.  Last time I went I threw away my food."}
{"text":"There are many *****berto's in town and I have probably tried them all. It had been several years since I had been to Eriberto's and after a night of drinking and karaoke I stopped by for a late night Mexican food fix. 

Everything was great. I had a carne asada burrito and three rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese. Both were really good. The carne asada burrito was huge and probably had half a pound of meat and the rolled tacos were covered in fresh guacamole and cheese. All food is served with fresh green and red salsa on the side. 

It's a very casual place so don't look for fancy here, but it's very clean.  

Best part is, this one is open 24 hours! Aren't all *****berto's open 24 hours you ask?  Actually no, there are several in town that are not. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was HONGRY and on my way to Subway when I smelled the beef cooking at this Eri of the bertos and diverted to walk in and find the beef. 

I got the beef burrito which was ready in probably less than two minutes, and thought instantly \"Wow! That's huge!\"  Then I thought, \"Wow, if I put that in my pants, people would say \"Wow!  That's a huge burrito in your pants!\", but it was still very hot and I was still hungry and not planning to step out anywhere, so I just left it in the bag until I got home.
  
It was so big, and I am still talking the burrito here, that I broke out the food scale and that sucker weighed in at over 14 ounces.  And it was delicious.  The meat was incredibly tender and juicy and unlike one of those $7 sodium overdose salt-licks from that well-known and well, \"cleaner\" burro chain, it was: 
1. Not a salt-lick, and was
2.  $4.66 - with tax.  

I've been here maybe twice before and once more late-night through the drive-through (which, as I vaguely recall, DID take quite a while). but the food on all occasions was decent or better and inexpensive.  Inside it's walk-up counter service with a handful of  tables and chairs for in-house dining.  I think I recall an old video game of some sort faintly beeping and booping in the background but not loud enough to get my attention.  The interior looks a bit worn but without the character of a truly old, longstanding establishment.  I didn't note anything overtly dirty, but it is certainly without the bright'n'shiny factory clean I expect from the national fast food chains (though don't always find there either).  

I don't know if there were any more than the mom n pop looking pair behind the counter, but between the drive-through and the counter, they were working hard.  The lady who took my order, rang me up and handed over my food was competent on the cashiering, and as friendly as time allowed. My food on all four occasions, probably 2 of those burritos-only, including one massive, filling-if-greasy breakfast burro from the drive-through and two dine-in dinners, were all decent or better (such as tonight's beef burro), at good prices, no foreign bodies or parts noted in the food, and no gastric distress in the aftermath.   It's not exactly destination dining but if you're on your way to or from and you're HONGRY and/or a bit broke, you may be glad it's there - on the east side of 7th Ave, just north of Osborn."}
{"text":"How the great have fallen. I've been coming to this Berto's for 16 years, for many of those years it was the only \"Berto's\" I would order from. The food was phenomenal, their hot sauce was spicy and would gove you the sweats, their service wasn't great but no one expects that when they're stumbling in drunk \"af\" at 2AM with a number of other drunks.

However, about 4 years ago everything changes, I can only assume that their original cook left or they got a new grill because everything tastes different now. The tacos which used to be the best greasy tacos in town now taste like they've been boiled almost. The meat lacks almost any flavor and is even a different color than their old deep brown. The hot sauce tastes watered down and even their green sauce lacks any flavor. 

Their carne asada used to be something I would crave all week, or eat every day happily for a week, now its something I won't even bother with. Their carne fries which uses to be the perfect go to after a heavy night of drinking, are limp and soggy. 

Oh Eriberto's...how I miss the golden days, and the angry older woman who'd mess up my order but still made me fall in love with each bite (so long as it wasn't with guacamole)."}
{"text":"Amazing service,  did take out for our jobs potluck.... Got 30 mini chili's which we're huge!!,  30 rolled tacos,  with all the sides rice,  beans,  salsa,  guac,  sour cream,  carrot/jalapenos (huge portions) for just 100$. And they we're deliver too.  Company went above and beyond!!  Definatley the best chimis ever!!"}
{"text":"Best Carne Asada Fries I've had. Today was my first time there and I will be back! The people who wrote about the meat being dry should try it again, the carne asada is flavorful and cooked perfectly today at least. Large portions, reasonable price, small but cozy. I got the green salsa and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. It is truly authentic Mexican food. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for Mexican food. My favorite thing on the menu is the carne asada tacos with rice and beans. Yum yum my favorite place in town."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos. Recommended from a friend and they were right. Delicious mango smoothies! Icy smoothies worth it. Took food to go"}
{"text":"Mixed enchilada plate.  1/15/2018

To be honest I was expecting the same old mediocre Mexican food u get with any of the \"bertos\" chains. 

Wow was I wrong. The owner is an extremely nice guy and you can really tell how much love and care goes into his food. It's a small place, VERY CLEAN, but the best part about that is the owner is the chef so you get the best care into the preparation of
Your meal. The flavor combination was unlike any I have had before and was just incredible. I am so happy I found a New Mexican place of this quality, reasonably priced so close to home! I can wait to try other things on his menu.

I couldn't recommend this place any higher. 5 stars all around. I challenge anyone to prove me wrong. Please go eat at this place, it's new and he needs the love. Such amazing food"}
{"text":"This has literally been my favorite taco shop for the last 6 years and will be for the next so many years. I go out of my way to come here. They have a carne asada  fries burrito that's to die for. Their dollar tacos are on point and they will make you a burrito with whatever you want in it as long as they have it. I asked for the dankest burritos I found in Facebook and they made it with no questions. It was literally so amazing I wish they had it on their menu. I plan on getting it almost every time now. it's carne Asada, shrimp, rice, fries, sour cream &a gauc.

I got mine without gauc added cheese and lettuce and cilantro!

Also the staff is always really fucking cool. I've come to kinda know them and they tend to remember their regulars. They're all really nice !"}
{"text":"The owner is so friendly and kind . I actually stumbled across this place going home . I was craving Mexican and Tada I found eribertos!
Everything is fresh and can be made custom ordered . They speak English and Spanish . Excellent customer service . I even was given a free soda Bc the owner saw my teacher badge . He also is very knowledgeable about what he cooks not just some guy who has a restaurant but rather someone who is passionate about food !

I ordered the shrimp burrito . Excellent !"}
{"text":"The burritos are the Bomb!! The fish tacos are really good. The salsa's are hand made."}
{"text":"The food for a Taco Shop is Ok... I got 3 bean and cheese burritos for almost 16$ That's pretty dam pricey if u ask me. I didn't look at the price when ordering so shame on me , but when I got to the window and she took my $ I then asked how much burritos were she said 4.48$ each , shocked and stunned at the price still I didn't have time to do the math in my head , I get my food .. Confused , I pull over to see the menu and BEAN Burritos are 3.15$ cheese is .95 so that equals 4.10$ .. Where did she get 4.48$ ?? And how did it end up 16$ ?!?!  Long story short , BEAN and CHEESE burritos are not on the menu , cheese is a extra cost.  The burrito it's self isn't bad and isn't the best ... Bottom line - do the math before u order cause they don't . I will not be going there again , I can get way better 5$ bean and cheese somewhere else !"}
{"text":"On August 12, 2016 I went to this eatery for a carne asada burrito. It was jam packed with tender steak, however it was tragically short on everything else. Yes, there was some guacamole, but it was only toward the middle. I didn't detect any rice or beans in the burrito. I wouldn't say I'm disappointed, but I just expect more from a burrito. With this being said I will say that the staff is welcoming and friendly. The restaurant was clean and tidy."}
{"text":"Great carne asada, hot sauce and customer service. Family owned and run, they do a great job!"}
{"text":"My entire family loves the food from here! The flavor is so much better than other Mexican food places around. All of the ingredients are fresh, and everything is prepared AFTER it's ordered. The hot sauces are hand made, not out of a jar! And the service is amazing! I never leave without having a great conversation with the cool/cashier/manager! I recommend this place 100%!"}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé have been coming for a while now (like 4 years) and I know a lot of people say all the bertos are all the same but we can defiantly guarantee you that this place is the best. They have 2 drive throughs which makes ordering super easy and quick, come here and won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place sucks! They never get my order right. I ask for beans on my nachos and extra spicy carrots and they never come through. Sure they can charge me for my request and leave everything I ask for out. Don't bother calling them either, they always hang up or disconnect the phone."}
{"text":"I always get the same thing at Eri-b's, Fili-b's, et cetera, and I've learned my lesson. This is the only one that make my burro as delish as it is. 

Potatoes, cheese, and guacamole.

I know, carbfest 2007, but it's just amazing.

They use some gelatinous guac, which we won't talk about, but the taters are freakin french fries! It's not even really that Mexican?! It's a great choice, and the cheese is beautifully greasy. The guys handing you your food are almost always stoned, so they know a good burrito when they're making it.

The \"salsa\" is also top notch, verde and red sauce.

They only get 4 because of the regret I feel in the AM."}
{"text":"Not bad for a divey, drive-through, 24-hour a day Mexican restaurant. I recently came in and ordered about 20 breakfast burrito for a big project we were working on and about 20 minutes later walked out with the order. Everyone really enjoyed the variety of burritos we ordered including potato (vegetarian), ham, bacon, and chorizo). They have a wide variety of lunch and dinner options as well. The service is not the friendliest for the most part but the food is cooked to order and uses fresh ingredients. Be prepared for an extra fee to use your credit card (I think it was $0.60), and bring your appetite because they are not shy with portion!"}
{"text":"I don't know any history about the Berto stuff.  I've had Fili and Eri.  
I like Eri better.
Been here maybe 6 times for lunch.  

One reason I like this place is the prices.  I can get way too full and for under $5.  Their burritos top out at $4.99 so that's some good cheap eatin'.

It can cost a dollar, but if it tastes like a dollar then its still no good.  So the main reason I love this place is because everything I've gotten here has tasted like gold nuggets.  

First thing I got was the nachos.  'Big' is too few letters in a word to describe the serving size.  3 people can eat off that thing easily...and I mean 3 of ME.  Loaded, man.  The meat (think I got carne asada) was juicy and tender and ALL OVER THE PLACE...under chips, in the corner, at the bottom, etc.  Not just a few strips of meat on top then fluff to fill it out.  That order of nachos was the best I've ever had from anywhere.

Then I got a two tacos - carne asada and abodaba (or whatever).  Again, the serving size was way more than enough for a big guy and there was enough meat and goodie falling off of each taco, that you could make two new tacos.  And oh man, the taste.  Once again - juicy, tender, mondo flavorful.  Just crazy good.

The next few times, I stuck with those taco choices, then I tried the breakfast burrito.  Sweet heavens.  I don't even like breakfast burritos, but this one is a must whenever I'm in the office on a weekend early.  Huge.  Like \"that's what she said\" huge.  Heavy.  Chock full.  Juicy.  I honestly haven't had anything that perfect for breakfast before.  This will either keep you going until dinner, or put you to sleep until dinner.  Actually, I don't remember exactly what was in it, but it was everything good.  Everything good.

Finally, the king of all things.  Carnitas.  First time I got a carnitas burrito from here, I danced.  I wanted to sing but...no.  No exaggeration - this was the best burrito I've ever had in my life.  And it was really due to the meat.  Crispy pork that's tender and juicy at the same time?  C'mon now.  I have no choice but to love it.  I would just end up picking the meat out just savor how wonderful the texture and flavor were.  This was my first experience with carnitas and now I haven't ordered anything but carnitas this and carnitast that since.  Today I had two crispy shell carnitas tacos.  Again, I danced.  

If there is carnitas out there that tastes better than this, I must find it.  I must be informed.  Anyone reading this review is now obligated to update me, because you will fall and break your spleen if you don't.

Cheap.  Huge portions.  Perfectly tasty.  This place is a winner.  And I like it way better than the other berto thing.  And drive thru.  Yep."}
{"text":"Was there during my visit in October and man was it good.  I usually get the Carne Asade burrito.  I forgot how good it was.  As soon as I finished it I wanted to go and get another one.   And having the drive thru makes this place a breeze.  Can't wait to be back in AZ to stop at this place."}
{"text":"Been eating here a few months now and usually get the shredded beef tacos. The tacos are amazing if you pay a little extra for extra cheese and lettuce. But every time I get something else it gets messed up or its just terrible. The last few times were the worst and that's why I decided to write a review. A few weeks ago I ordered a breakfast burrito with just veggies and my eggs has a big piece of what looked like bacon fat back or piece of ham fat. Whatever it was it was disgusting. Then i tried some Nachos, with the \"carne asada\" on it. Pretty sure it wasn't beef. In fact I went back another time and ordered nachos with \"no beef\"  and the woman on the intercom actually corrected me to call it meat, not beef. And those particular nachos were just as bad without the \"meat\". The cook just globbed sour cream and guacamole all over the chips so you can't pick them up. I asked for diced tomatoes and got two half tomatoes with cuts in them. Oh they forgot to put cheese on the chips.. THEY FORGOT CHEESE ON NACHOS! They garnished with cheese, on the cold ingredients so no melted cheese. So all I got was a nasty cold pile of sour cream, about two cups amount, and guacamole, about another cup, on about a handful of tortilla chips. Thank God they opened up a Juliobertos up the street so there's no reason to eat here anymore. The only reason I would is I would get off work very late and they were the only thing open. Avoid this place of you can!"}
{"text":"If you moved to Phoenix as a youthful person, rather than as a retiree, an important rite of passage is to find yourself, some time between midnight and 4 a.m., in the drive-through of a taco shop with a name ending in -berto's. This is a perfectly good -berto's for that purpose, being reasonably convenient to both the Crescent Ballroom (if you tanked up on Honey Badgers there but didn't weight them down with the in-house burritos) or the Rhythm Room.

The chimichanga is large enough for two meals, as is pretty much anything else. Avoid any dish swimming in red sauce if your coordination is impaired or if you're just plain klutzy. The food is both better and cheaper than Chipotle, plus there's a considerably more varied menu. Also: heats up well the next day.

Try not to fall asleep in the drive-through, though, as it really does take forever."}
{"text":"I go to Eribertos once a week. I bring my friends with me all the time! They have great Mexican food and vegetarians options, too! I love that it is 24/7! It's sometimes hard to get out of events late and finding a hangout spot with good food. It is affordable and taste great! Jairo is a great worker! He remembers our order every time!"}
{"text":"Location, location, location. 

Do you know how frustrating it is when it feels as though every Mexican food place in CenPho is a sit-down restaurant with limited hours? Goodness gracious, this is what I needed. Lowkey, there is a drive through if you make a right (while facing the building) and go around. 

I've greatly enjoyed their burritos, but not their other stuff. Works for me anyway, I need this for late nights and early mornings."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time great food always busy. I find the food here just as good as manual's if you want take out. They never skimp on the meat."}
{"text":"Yippee for $1.00 taco Tuesday!!! Tacos are also a dollar on Monday- Wednesday  every week!!! The owner is very friendly and the food is tasty!  $1 tostadas on Thursdays!

Located in the same little shopping center as Hungry Howies Pizza. Very clean inside. Stop by Eribertos for quick and inexpensive Mexican food!"}
{"text":"The food here is a 3 star but the convenience of being able to get a decent burrito at 1am bumps it up to a 4."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Kind of bland, had the carne asada burrito. Asked for their spiciest hot sauce, which they said was the red sauce.  This didn't even register as spicy to my daughter who isn't into spicy food. I had to use El Pollo Loco's green sauce we had from a couple days before."}
{"text":"This was our favorite drive-thru restaurant when we lived in Phoenix.  Whenever I am back in Phoenix, I make sure I make at least one visit to this place!  I miss having their tacos and their quesadillas!"}
{"text":"Heaven had best have a 'bertos or I will be sorely disappointed.  This one is the closest to me, and there are always two or three cars at the drive-thru 24/7.  There's a reason: at least a few of their dishes are fantastic.

I've gotten takeout there about 20-30 times.  Most commonly the carnitas super nachos, which are HUGE and flavorful, with more than enough of every topping.  Slather with two each of their red sauce and green sauce.  Be sure to have a friend handy--otherwise, you will convince yourself that reheated nachos aren't so good and therefore you should finish the entire deliciousness in one sitting.  Chips--crispy and tasty, never stale.  It's the kind of chow that's so good, you scrape the bottom of the styrofoam container for remnants.

I've gotten really tasty taco combination plates a few times, and the huevos rancheros breakfast plate is also yummy.  I don't branch out much here because the nachos and tacos are so spectacular.  If anyone else posts a review and raves about a different dish, I'll go for it.  Oh yeah.. got carne asada once and I recall the parachute-sized tortillas that came with it were incredible."}
{"text":"I've only been here on two occasions: once when I first moved here and was craving a breakfast burrito on the go, and once late night. Let me start of by saying that Eribertos is the perfect drunk food...seriously. I got the crane asada tacos an was a very happy camper. The staff is friendly, and if you speak to them en espanol they're even friendlier. Their menu is extensive and you can get essentially anything Mexican you crave--even horchata.

Overall, if you're inebriated and starving, DEFINITELY try eribertos late night delights."}
{"text":"I've eaten here mannnnny times... Had pretty much everything on their menu. Around xmas I wanted green chili... So I made the biggest mistake ever and got a burrito from eribertos. Worst food poisoning I've ever had. I can hardly even look at the building now without wanting to vom. I hate to say it- because it's only happened one time. But when people get sick from food, it means they're not doing something right. Food sickness is no joke, and I won't ever be going back. I just don't trust it."}
{"text":"Some beast burritos here!  They are relatively cheap and are a better quality than other 24/7 Mexican places in the Valley.  I got the bean and cheese burrito and the wife the quesadilla and both were delicious.  If it's late and you need a Mexican fix this is the place to get it!"}
{"text":"This place was kind of a dive, but then again - that's where you often find the best food. Everything was very authentic from the taco shells, to the spices and beans. My family and I ordered about 10 tacos (both chicken and beef) and honestly, I had a hard time not eating all 10.

The location was convenient (for me) as well and the prices were good."}
{"text":"Good chorizo con juevo plate.. yummy papa chorizo con juevo burritos.. good beans... nice employees but tacos need more meat ."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for late night munchies. Ok, so it's probably not the highest quality food out there, but it sure beats McDonald's and definitely hits the spot! My favorite meals here are the Carne Asada Chimichanga and the Carne Asada burrito. A lot of people like the Arizona versions, but I'm not a big fan of fries in my burritos."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I've ever had! Better than Filibertos and Fredricos! The restaurant is very clean and the service is exceptional. The owner is very personable and enjoys serving the community."}
{"text":"Saugy  carne asada nachos  and they took a long time preparing my food as if they made chips fresh"}
{"text":"I gotta say I like Eri's brother Fili much better. Or is it a sister. I'm not sure. While I devoured the carnitas tacos in my car at Filibertos, happily, with a smile and even a sense of danger...the goods I've had at Eribertos have left my mouth dry, unfulfilled and on one occasion, injured. Yes. I said injured. Keep reading. Rickie likes the Americana Burrito for breakfast...had it twice...both times too dry for me. No beans? I've eaten the carne asada and carnitas tacos...both just OK...I like my carnitas to be both succulent and crispy. Did I just say succulent? So I'm not always fulfilled...as I am with a carnitas tacos from Fiiberto's. AND then there was the time when I bit into some strange foreign object...and by foreign object I do not mean Aziz Ansari. Though biting into him might be mighty tasty. The drive thru guys are uber friendly. I wonder sometimes though, does anyone ever go inside? Fili. Eri. Whatev. Just glad when I need a fix I don't have to get outta my car! Buenos Nachos My Yelpitas!"}
{"text":"Nothing like midnight snack, when you're drunk and when you want something quick and easy. :)))

Cheese enchiladas is the best. Yummmm
Bubbas always get the steak and egg burrito, Gets to him every time."}
{"text":"First time there. SUPER friendly owner. He gave us chips and salsa while he cooked our food. That's amazing customer service!! We had ground beef tacos, chicken tacos, refried beans and the BEST fish tacos!! We will be back for sure. Everything was really good. Can't wait to tried some more stuff."}
{"text":"Every time I go here, it's been great! Carne Asada Quesadilla is delicious! Never any chewy or fatty steak. The service is fast and friendly. Will recommend going here. Better than any other \"berto's\" in the valley!"}
{"text":"It's just another 'Berto's' around the phoenix area. It is pretty similar to most of the other places with a similar name. The one thing that really stands out about this place is that not only do they have 2 drive threws bit they have a walk up window that is also open all nigjt long! This is a plesent feature to a 'fast food' place, i know im not the only one who has tried to walk up to a drive threw and try to order because the inside was closed only to be rudly turned away. Well this walk up window will prevent that from happening at this location. As far as the food goes, they serve you a very generous portion of food. The burritos are huge, stuffed with the meat of your choice, carne asada, fish, beef, chicken, carnitas and then your choice of cheese beans and sauces. Great for a late night meal after a couple drinks."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food, open 24 hours, and the friendliest service in Phoenix. Definitely knows how to keep loyal customers. This place always has fresh food. I've never been disappointed ."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos in Phoenix and quite possibly the world. I've tried all of the -Bertos and Eribertos is by far my favorite. Sometimes there can be a bit of a wait, but it is well worth it. Tortillas and Red Sauce were crafted by the hands of angels. Great ratio of bacon/egg/cheese. If you're looking for a great breakfast burrito, your search ends here. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Eriberto's is the best little spot to grab Mexican food! They have everything you need and the staff is awesome. They recently got new ownership and the restaurant looks great!"}
{"text":"Beware. They do not practice proper procedures and will end up serving you food melted THROUGH the styrofoam containers. On top of that their customer service will leave you being laughed at and scowled upon, on top of them talking shit because they think you don't know spanish right in front of you.  All when you demand food that does not have cancerous plastic melted into it. A fresh order and an apology is how you handle it. Not sending them back home after a second trip with  cold food and not a difference in how they packaged it . After what my husband saw them doing while cooking the food as he waited, I assure a call to the health department about sanitation and cross contamination.  As regular patrons we will no longer go there. You should seriously reconsider the etiquette of your little taco stand people."}
{"text":"Tasty! I enjoy the Americano Burrito and cheese enchiladas. I didn't like the Burro that much, but that's my personal preference and I probably wouldn't like it anywhere. It's 24 hours, it's got a drive-thru. It is very convenient. It never seems to take very long to get my food. The location is good, too, like if you needed to pick up some things from Safeway and then swing through the drive-thru, it's very easy and convenient. Their salsas are very good and remind me of New Mexico chile. They add a 50 cent charge to use cards, so if you have cash and want to save a little going there, that's the way to go, but it's relatively inexpensive anyway."}
{"text":"I am typically a Fili B's girl as opposed to the generic ***berto's fan, but I can compromise since Fili B's are harder to find when you aren't in the EV.  I was really really craving a big ol' steak and egg burrito, and I knew the only way to satisfy that craving would be from one of these places.  We were on our way uptown and we ALWAYS see cars in the Eriberto's drive thru on our way to work, so I figured it had to be one of the better ones.  Oh man it is!  My burrito was more like a steak with egg burrito.  It probably weighed three pounds!  It was absolutely delicious, flavorful, and surprisingly not greasy!  I devoured a whopping half of it before I tapped out and then I ate the rest for breakfast the next morning, and yeah, it actually tastes just as good.  I can't really attest to the quality of the other menu items, but if they are even half as good as my burrito was, then you're in good hands."}
