{"text":"We were sad to learn that the hole-in-the-wall location in the Centennial Center moved a little ways down the road, but we are happy for this family's success in opening a bigger location. The food here is always fresh and delicious.  The gyro meat is tender and flavorful, the hummus is creamy, and the pita is always fresh and hot. They have good tabbouleh and salads. The pumpkin soup is fantastic!  I have never had a bad meal here, and the family and staff is always so very nice."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed here. The food is plentiful, flavorful, and delicious! The service is always with a smile.  Their gyros are tender and the salads here are dressed just right. Save room for dessert! The cheesecake is made with a baklava crust and is to die for."}
{"text":"Good food. Wraps come with a tasty side salad. Four stars if they ever bring back the tiramisu cheesecake."}
{"text":"One of the best!!! The food was fresh and authentic!! Everyone who works there are amazing super sweet and always with a smile!!"}
{"text":"Great Food! The staff is very professional and courteous.  I always get the Filet Gyro and it is amazing every single!

Definitely a place to checkout if you have a craving for Greek Food!"}
{"text":"Met up w/friend for dinner on Wednesday. Being gluten free, I ordered the lamb roast which came wrapped in lettuce v pita bread. Unfortunately, I wasn't hungry so the entire meal came home with me. My girlfriend ordered the same meal in a pita & said it was very good. Our waitress knew her stuff but wasn't great w/follow up as to needing more water. I'd venture back here at a future time."}
{"text":"Had the pomegranite chicken and a gyro, both were very, very good, but the best thing there was the pumpkin baklava cheescake! it is a must have!"}
{"text":"Second time here. Enjoyed dinner( Promagrante Chicken). The service was quick and staff checked on us often. The meal is great and prices reasonable. Next visit I will try a dessert. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful.  The staff is super friendly.  The food was ok.  I ordered the mousaka entree and it was dry.  The baklava was hard and all I could taste was cinnamon."}
{"text":"Best geek restaurant in Vegas I've been thus far, their moussaka is the closest to the one you'd get in Greece!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!!! By far one of my favorite places to eat! I will definitely be coming back and recommending this restaurant to others. I hope the other location is just as amazing!
Wait staff was so friendly and provided great recommendations! Very warm and inviting atmosphere, handicap accessible!
The food was delicious. The meat in the gyros will melt in your mouth! Rice is seasoned n cooked perfectly. Everything had great flavors, was well prepared and plated beautifully.
Dessert is just as food as everything else! The cake was so moist and delicious! They do not skimp on the portions!"}
{"text":"I'm in the area every six months for business and always make sure I eat at the Market Grille Cafe.  The staff has always been friendly and the food is on your table quickly and it's all been very good.  Great soups especially the pumpkin mushroom."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for a quick lunch on a Sunday. When you walk in you will find the menu on the wall on the left side. I was greeted by a friendly server at the cash register. I went with the Chicken gyro platter & drink which was $14.40. The price seems expensive to me for what you get with the meal. I thought the chicken gyro was a little short on the chicken and had too much lettuce. I'm used to going to places where there is so much chicken in the gyro that it is constantly falling out while eating your meal. The taste of the gyro was very good but disappointing from the lack of chicken. The platter includes a side Greek salad and rice. I especially liked the added touch of small pieces of grape leaves mixed into the rice. The drink fountain has several choices of sodas and two different freshly made iced tea options.
The restaurant was very clean. There was a constant stream of friendly employees walking to by your table to make sure everything was okay.
I would recommend this place for a quick meal. I'll give it another shot in the future to see if there is other meals that offer better value."}
{"text":"Outstanding Food.
I've had \"lamb\" kabobs and a \"gyro\" on another occasion. I recommend having the \"house\" dressing if you have a salad. They are secretive about the ingredients though. 
Nice place to eat !!!"}
{"text":"So amazing. Had the falafel with fries. I am so glad I found this place! Best greek food I've had in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Attentive wonderful staff and great food. I absolutely enjoy coming here. The atmosphere is very relaxed and staff is extremely attentive."}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better customer service! I never write reviews but I had to for this place. Everyone we interacted with was so friendly and helpful in explaining the menu. The manager even gave us a 15% off coupon for our next visit for being first time customers. We will certainly be back for more!"}
{"text":"My family and I dined here on a whim, seeing as we have just moved into the neighborhood. We started with the Saganaki appetizer, which was served with warm pita bread and was absolutely amazing! All of the food came out in a timely fashion.  My husband and I both ordered the steak kabobs which came with basmati rice, a Greek salad and a side of pita bread with hummus. The meat was lacking in flavor for me, but my husband said his was fantastic so maybe I just got a batch that hadn't marinated long enough. We ended with a rice pudding for dessert which was pretty mushy and definitely not the best that I've had.

Overall the service was wonderful and the food was good. I will definitely go back to try other things on their menu. The saganaki itself is worth returning for."}
{"text":"This food helps me so much with my new Mediterranean kick. They fill the holes where needed. 

I am a plain jane, plain and simple kind of guy. So I will begin saying that their lunch specials ROCK! A Chicken Gyro or the Pomegranate Chicken salad is not only considered a healthy lunch but a tasty lunch as well. There are a couple items as well that are under their lunch specials and they're only 7.50. 

Aside from the lunch specials there is a HUGE selection of Mediterranean favorites to choose from which I have yet to begin to explore but will because I am already sold on their food, product, atmosphere and service.

If I had an award for Champion of Local Small Business, Market Grille Cafe would be it. In both restaurants you will find televisions playing video of the Market Grille family and it really makes you respect the place for being a family business. In Las Vegas, a family business and even a restaurant being a family business is a hard thing to come by because barely any succeed. I remember as a teen eating at their first location off of Tropical Parkway and Centennial. They expanded and opened up a second location off of Lake Mead and Rock Springs. Next thing I know they relocated their original store to an old abandoned Chili's building off of Durango between Elkhorn and Deer Springs. I really hope these guys are doing good and hope they're having resulted success with business volume.

The only thing I could recommend to these guys is keeping everything the same. Distinguishing between both locations they do a very good job at that. However, the Centennial restaurant offers table service. There are servers, they serve on you and I would consider it a casual style dining. At the Lake Mead restaurant, you fill up your own drinks, pick your own table and the only thing delivered to you is your food and your silverware. BOTH ARE FINE, I AM IN THE INDUSTRY AND TIP REGARDLESS! But I think it would be more successful for Market Grille to pick a method of service and stick to it as opposed to it being differentiated between both restaurants. There are penny pinchers that could be scared away from this location because they are accustomed to the style of service they receive at the Lake Mead and Rock Springs location.

They're friendly, the product is fresh and some could see it as a little pricy. Deal with it, because you get what you pay for. The service is awesome, the food is consistent and their PUMPKIN BAKLAVA CHEESECAKE is amazing. 

Keep strong Market Grille, I'll see you soon!"}
{"text":"Loved the food, try the pomegranate chicken it is so good. The service is incredible but the ambience of the restaurant is the best. Appetizers and dessert are a must."}
{"text":"Fresh delightful food.... I won't say it's the best Greek I've had but it really does the job."}
{"text":"Consistently a good, locally owned restaurant.  My wife and I have really enjoyed eating here, and everybody who we bring from out of town has not been disappointed.  The traditional hero and pomegranate chicken are always good. If you are feeling like dessert, the baklava crust on their cheesecake is amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and environment. A must try! Don't miss out on phenomenal Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I love it!!!  The greek salad with lamb and the pomegranate chicken are AMAZING!!!  Very kid friendly.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the service! What a wonderful find if you're looking for healthy and yummy :0)"}
{"text":"I just bought picked up three things and the bill was $33.00 and that included a bowl of soup. The food is awesome but the prices are too high. I will miss coming here but my checking account will not."}
{"text":"The chicken wrap and the seasoned fries are delicious!!! Ima start being a regular and try new things"}
{"text":"Amazing Gyro, and pasta. Carefully prepared food. Extremely fresh and full of flavor. Generous portion sizes. Extensive food and beverage menu!"}
{"text":"First timers and the food is amazing and so is the service. We had the Falafel and Lamb Roast Gyros, they were amazing. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The chicken kabob entree is my absolute favorite thing to order here.  You get:  1 kabob jam packed with marinated chicken, 1 kabob of marinated mixed vegetables, a huge side of rice pilaf, a heaping of greek salad, and hummus and pita chips.  Talk about bang for your buck!  

The original lamb gyro is my second favorite thing to order here.

Market Grille now has a waitstaff, which I am kind of disappointed in.  I felt the old system of ordering at the register, taking a number, and getting your own drink worked just fine.  

Their customer service is superb, everyone is always very friendly and attentive.  

Tip:  Occasional 15% off coupons for Market Grill inside of the Review Journal."}
{"text":"Went there around one on Saturday afternoon. Service was great and food got to the table super fast. Food was very good and delicious After we paid for the meal one of the managers came over and asked us about our experience. Must go!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a family owed Greek Restaurant. They also have some Italian and other Mediterranean dishes. The food is excellent and the portions are generous. Very busy for a Monday early evening. They have a free standing location on Durango in Summerlin."}
{"text":"The pomegranate chicken and gyro platter are divine. My kids love the baclava cheesecake. The to-go counter is fast. Great place!"}
{"text":"I usually hit them up a few times a year, when I'm in the area.

Lunch special traditional gyro and their Greek seasoned fries are bomb.
I always order extra tzatziki on the side because I like it a lot.

My friends like the pomegranate chicken.
But I've never had anything other than the traditional gyro because I don't have to."}
{"text":"I love this place! We usually get the gyros pita and gyros salad with a feta cheese and kalamata appetizer. The pita is warm and soft. The meat is great. It's reasonably priced and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Gyros are good, 2 places in Vegas are better. Location is very nice, but $38 for one gyro platter and gyro salad plus drinks (cokes). Pretty expensive for what you can else where in Vegas for $25."}
{"text":"Sweet staff. Food was so mediocre. It tasted as if it had just been microwaved, but could use another minute. Dry. I won't be back. Not sure why people love this food. Again, nice people."}
{"text":"Called in an order to go and the guy who answered the phone, Cody, was extremely helpful and professional. When I arrived the food was ready, each item was showed to me before bagged to make sure it was correct. Even bringing the food home it was good. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably fabulous. Best Greek salad I've ever had. Outstanding hummus and pita. Delicious skewers and Greek wine. A perfect 10!!"}
{"text":"The food was really good and refreshing, and service was in point. We really enjoyed that the manger came and greeted us because we were first timers, very professional of her."}
{"text":"It's good, but I grew up in the Middle East and I've even had better here in the states. The food here was good. The tatziki was awesome with chunks of cucumber. The service was friendly. Just not the best I've had."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I often go to the Market Grille for lunch. My favorite item on the menu is the Greek Salad. All the ingredients are fresh and tasty. The only dis-like's I have about the Market Grille are the following: the price they charge to add meat to a salad and also how they recently stopped offering a discount for LVAC members."}
{"text":"I have seriously eaten here over 50 times, and I know this because of all the \"frequent diner\" cards I burn through.

I came here when they very first opened and have been hooked ever since.  It is pretty hard to find a quality, affordable, non-chain, veg-friendly restaurant to go to in this town- but Market Grille fits the bill.

Everything is homemade and the ingredients are always fresh.  The service is always very friendly, and even though it's more of a fast-food set up, they are always coming by to make sure everything is ok.  The space is homey and casual.

The salad, hummus, and pita never disappoint.  I usually get the veggie skewers and my husband usually orders the veggie gyro.  When we really want to pig out, we order the combo appetizer platter as well.  

And I really can't even begin to describe to you my love affair with their cheesecake (and their pumpkin cheesecake, for that matter).  This has been my birthday cake for the last couple years.

Their prices are affordable and they have vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free menus.  We have brought several family members here while they were visiting Vegas, and they all still talk about how great the restaurant was and how they wish they could have a slice of the cheesecake."}
{"text":"I really like this place, just ask my family - it's my go-to faster-food option, mainly because it's fresh, healthy, quick, and very tasty. My favorite menu items include the lamb skewers (full plate), the falafels, and the baba ganoush (with cucumbers).  The pomegranate chicken is also good.  Prices are reasonable and  yelper's often get a coupon (i.e., good deal!) upon checking in (the last coupon I used was for 20% off the bill).  Service is also quick, for lunch you order from the counter and for dinner they have sit-down service."}
{"text":"Every time i find my new favorite thing on the menu, the next time i come i find something new that i love. The pomegranate chicken is fabulous. Don't forget to get an order of yaya cookies. They have out door seating with misters if the mood hits you to do so."}
{"text":"Every time I visit my parents in Vegas, I always request to head to Market Grille Cafe for lunch or dinner. The staff is always super friendly and provides excellent service. The best part is the food! There are so many options which makes it a great place to take a large group of people with varying palates to eat. I've tried a variety of dishes and none of them have ever been a disappointment. I'll continue to make it my regular spot whenever I'm in town! 
PS: have the baklava...it's perfect"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I had never tried saganoki but I'm glad I did and I highly recommend trying it. The service was amazing and the environment was clean and cozy."}
{"text":"It took us forever to try this place but I am glad we did! The service has always been excellent and the food consistently good. Their lunch special is awesome and it goes every day of the week which is a plus! 

My favorite menu items are:
Gyros: I've had the chicken, traditional and the fillet (steak). The fillet is my favorite but they were all good! Get the dill yogurt sauce!

Soup and Salad Combo: Greek salad and lentil soup. I am on a quest to figure out the recipe for this lentil soup. It is delicious. The salad takes a back seat to the soup but it has always been fresh and tasty.



Hummus: Spinach Basil and the Roasted Red Pepper. They are both fantastic! They serve it with warm, fresh pita bread and it is difficult to not want to eat it all before your meal even arrives!


Fries: These were good, but Paymon's are better. I was surprised that they did not seem as \"home made\" as the other menu items. The seasoning is alright and the dipping sauce is good. I usually just stick to ordering hummus as our appetizer though. 

The only thing I have ordered and didn't care for was the falafel. And I think that was more my personal taste preference then incorrect preparation.

Desserts: Baklava cheesecake. Need I say more? The pumpkin version is wonderful as well.

Honey Walnut Cake: Super moist, not overly sweet. Kind of like a coffee cake/spice cake? We loved it. 

Ya Yas Cookies: Would be great with hot tea. Kind of like a short bread cookie. If you just want something a little sweet and not overly filling, give these a try! 

My family has tried other dished and loved them (stuffed bell peppers, moussaka etc) but I am sticking to what I have personally eaten and enjoyed :)

I am really pleased that they opened this location in the North end of town where I sometimes feel we are lacking quality restaurants. We go here several times a month (sometimes more!!). 

If you're in the Northwest part of the valley, give them a try!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a fair amount of positive reviews, so I have to wonder if folks in Vegas haven't had an opportunity to experience high quality Greek food.  

We started off with the saganaki and the greek salad.  The saganaki portion was on the smallish side for the ten dollar price point.  It was a fairly standard saganaki - tasted fine.  The greek salad, however, was a huge disappointment.  The salad was terribly stingy on the feta cheese and the vinaigrette had a strange flavor.  It was homemade, but they overpowered it with dried herbs (thyme and basil) instead of using fresh herbs.  Perhaps we just had a poorly made batch, but the flavor was unpleasant.

Our entrees were a gyro and a meatball \"pizza\" made on a pita.  The pizza thing was a stupid choice - I had the lowest of expectations yet I was still disappointed.  It reminded me of something you would receive as the hot lunch selection in a grade school cafeteria.  It's inexplicable why this is on their menu.  

The gyro was mediocre at best.  The pita was soft, the cucumber sauce had nice flavor, but the meat was dry and unappetizing.  They also didn't slice the robust portion of gyro meat I'm accustomed to receiving at most Greek restaurants.    

To be honest, the best thing we ordered was the grilled chicken breast and french fries for our three year old.  The fries were hot and crisp and the chicken breast was moist and well cooked.  

The service was excellent.  Everyone was pleasant and attentive.  The ambiance in the restaurant was fairly typical for a Greek restaurant, however not as tacky as some.  Fair to say it has a nice atmosphere.  

As we were presented our check, we showed a ten dollar off coupon we had on our phone.  Our server told us they would not accept it because we hadn't printed it out.  Seriously?  They really need the paper print out?  It was the perfect capper to a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"The food here is always sooooo good! Even the though the dining room was a bit on the cool side, Malaysia,our sever, was warm and attentive. We had a really great experience."}
{"text":"This was our first visit (a friend's recommendation) and we will definitely be back.  We ordered the lunch special,  \"pick two\" and drink for $8.50. We had a traditional gyro, creamy lemon chicken rice soup, pomegranate chicken on basmati rice, and iced green blueberry jasmine tea.  Everything was delicious. The staff was helpful, pleasant, and  attentive.  Happy hour deal is $2 off a good selection of appetizers, wine, and beer."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service with excellent Greek food. The gyros with the yogurt dill sauce is amazing. I usually order to-go because of how speedy they are! Would recommend to anyone. A +!"}
{"text":"Lovely place. Decor is fascinating and it feels like your at a home full of love. Take out is available and there are busy because the food is exceptional and the service always comes with a smile. Universal language. Thank you"}
{"text":"I went to this Market Grill today to try out their happy hour menu.  The server showed the part of menu where happy hour prices dishes are listed and at the same time she mentions that some of them are not in  happy hour menu / prices.  When I enquired which one's are  and which one's arent, she was not clear. I once asked her to point out, which dishes are in happy - prices and which are not, the server was very vague and did not clearly provide an answer and slid through it. That made me wonder if this was deliberate and sales tactics.

If Market Grill is sincere, they must print another menu with dishes qualifying for happy hour prices.  
The falafel was tasty and properly cooked.
I have been at this place for lunch and dinner. I have noticed, portions have become smaller and service poorer in the past two years.

 Telephonic information provision is inadequate and short.  The two women I have spoken with in the past two months sound irritated and want to cut conversion as short as possible

Sorry, I thought Market Grill knew better, disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is great! Great food and really great take out service. I have only dined-in once, but they make to-go taste awesome. I always get their filet skewer, which also comes with rice, vegetables, pita & hummus, and a Greek salad. I always get a side of their yogurt dill sauce and it's to die for. They had a special going on in October for breast cancer and their cookies had the most amazing pink frosting on it. 

There is always a young gentleman who always works the takeout area when I come in. Very polite and courteous even when it's been busy."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food (voted best in Las Vegas).  Very fresh and excellent alcohol selection to compliment your lunch/dinner.  Gets crowded during lunch rush but plenty of seating to accommodate everyone.  Can get a little loud so would recommend it as a casual lunch or dinner spot.  Very cool Greek ambiance inside."}
{"text":"I have been eating their Greek food since their  small store by Walmart  for almost 6 years now. I moved to Colorado for 3 months and got back in December, and  since I have been back i have eaten there 5 times. The  past 3 times I have been there I have been very disappointed with the service. It seems as if the owners  hired people who don't give a shit and tonight was the final straw for me..I'm 23 years old  and I felt as if I was being put into a corner with a bunch of younger kids  because of my age.  However I always tip 20% or more because i have worked  for  tips my  whole life, so I  was upset to be discriminated against. We were waiting for our drinks to be taken for ten minutes..never even talked to a waiter so I took off.. Also last time I ordered pick up a young girl working the register completely charged someone else for my  meal and vice versa (and  she didn't even notice until it was pointed out to her). The manager came out and it was a  fifteen minute ordeal. Owners need to check their staff.. Food is always delicious but the staff makes it not worth my time..not going back for a while."}
{"text":"Never had Greek food before. It was pretty good. The waitress was such a sweet girl. We told her it was our first time and she really made sure we understood the food and enjoyed our time there. 5 stars were thanks to her."}
{"text":"If you love Greek food, this is the place to go. I'm here for take out order, and Justin is always helpful & courteous. He is very pleasant. Good service Justin."}
{"text":"I am pretty much z regular at this grill. The food was excellant as always...BUT...
what should have been the end to a pleasant meal definately was not. 
Their attention to detail in tasty food..stops there. In using their faciities after the meal,  before continuing on with my busy day, imagine my dismay in seeing that the unsanitary leaking toilet I had reported to them a month ago was merely now wrapped with a much less sanitary soaking dish rag and the floor was still soaking. OK, so I moved on down to a different stall. As a lady, doing my business...all of a sudden the lights go out and I am in pitch black. Assuming it was just a blown bulb I got out of there as fast as I could, as I left the light came back on...seeing a young blonde watress at the cash register I reported to her what had happened. Her responce \" yeah its on a motion timer, nothing we can do about it\". Well, if thats so...then something I \"can do about it\". Me not able to finish cleanly and not even able to wash my hands! Sorry. JOE, I wont be back. \"Nough said..."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to the new location on Durango. The food is great. Service is good."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and it has been fantastic each time. I'm addicted to the gyros and the Plato's potatoes are awesome. The service has always been great and they probably have the fastest take out in Las Vegas. If you want great Mediterranean food in a place where your treated like family, this is the place."}
{"text":"Excellent flavor and service. Truly a gem in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Wow...a great selection of items with a fresh taste, and good prices.  It doesn't get much better than than!?  Was going to dinner with my sister and we just decided to stop by here and give it a try.  I have an amazing wrap that was served with Greek salad on the side, and I also ordered a side of cannoli's.  I've better cannoli, so I would probably skip those next time, but the wrap - Yum!!  She has a salad, and said it was really good, filling, but still light.  The restaurant itself it really clean and they have some music playing low in the background; nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great location.  Name, decor, the menu, everything looks to be so promising, yet the food does not live up to it's potential.  I ordered the filet skewer, which was about 12 dollars, and a drink, and the total came to about 15 bucks.  I also asked if I can have the yogurt sauce, thinking it would come with the food, as it's a Greek place and all.  I guess I was wrong, since they charged me fifty cents for it.  The food was delivered to my table fairly quickly, by a charming young man who definitely improves the experience here.  Anyhow, I took a bite of my potatoes and immediately, my face turned blue.  The flavoring was so off, and salty and sour, I was sure the potatoes were stuffed with sour patch kids.  So I shifted my attention to the beef that was on my plate, and it too was again, too salty and sour.  C'mon guys, lemons are pricey these days, quit squeezing five lemons on top of every plate!  I'll stop here while I'm still ahead (alive), because honestly, the owner looked pretty buff and scary.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"I came here with my local friend who said the food served here was pretty good. We arrived on a Saturday night and surprisingly, it was not too crowded so we were seated right away. I loved the smell when I walked in; the aromas of all of the different kinds of foods cooking made me hungrier than I already was. The two servers were very friendly and attentive. 

I ordered an appetizer of Tzatziki & Pita bread slices and the chicken & veggie kabobs with the rice & salad for dinner. Everything was cooked to order and served promptly. The Tzatziki was VERY tasty! Not too strong and not too bland. The salad and dressing were also tasty. The chicken and veggie skewers were flavorful without being too dry. I scraped the chicken and veggies off of each skewer and mixed them all together in with my rice. YUM! 

I wish I would have saved room for dessert...everything looked and smelled delicious, but I just had NO room in my tummy for it after that wonderful meal. Next time I'll go back just for some coffee and dessert."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my wife here and we loved it. The food along with the atmosphere and price was great. The best part was the customer service. Our waitress was awesome and extremely helpful with the food choices. The owner gave us a 15% discount on our next visit for being first timers. I definitely recommend this to everyone in Centennial Hills."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now, the first for my boyfriend. I've enjoyed both times I've eaten here and he enjoyed his very first visit. They have 2 locations, one on Lake Mead and one in Centennial I believe, but the the Lake Mead location is more convienant for us. 
The place seems more family oriented, with a very friendly staff coming by to chat and make sure everything is perfect.
Upon arriving we were greeted immediately. For lunch you need to order at the register and it's seat yourself. I believe the first time I went was for lunch and I was seated immediately and handed a menu. A server came over and took our orders then. Anyways, besides the point. 
I ordered the traditional gyro platter with the dill yogurt sauce. The platter came with a Greek salad, pita bread, hummus and rice. More than enough for me! 
My boyfriend ordered the lamb kabob platter, which came with a Greek salad, pita bread, and rice.
The salads came out almost immediately. They were your typical Greek salads. A salad is a salad to me. 
I love a good gyro and I enjoyed this just as much as any other. They packed in a good amount of meat, which I pulled out maybe half and ate later with the rice & pita bread. The dill yogurt sauce was very subtle, not too sour or overpowering. 
My boyfriend enjoyed his lamb kabobs, found them to be very tender and a good amount of food for him. 
At the end of the meal our server came over to make sure everything was to our liking and boxed up my leftover and we were on our way.
Unfortunately, we left no room for dessert but the baklava with added ice cream and the tiramisu had caught our eye. I guess we will save that for next time.
All in all it was fast and an enjoyable lunch for us!"}
{"text":"Just passing by and decided to stop in! I LOVE Greek and this place is delicious. I'm a huge supporter of family owned businesses. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I really love this place. The atmosphere is fun and the service is amazing. Perfect mom and pop establishment"}
{"text":"Why does this place have such high reviews?  Went with a couple of friends for dinner.  Got a bunch of different dishes family style so we could all try a little bit of this and that.  Cons: wayyy tooo salty (couldn't even finish food), the food was not fresh (srsly, it looked frozen or made from the day before), and just soo generic.  Nothing special.  Save your money and go somewhere else.  We even gave the desserts a try (pumpkn baklava cheesecake) - once again, it tasted premade or frozen.  Grab some Marie Callender's frozen cheesecake from the grocery store.  I promise it'll taste better."}
{"text":"Excellent, and a great neighborhood eatery sans the ridiculous prices that keep locals away from many Vegas area restaurants. We had the Greek Trio Platter and the Pomegranate Chicken. Both were great."}
{"text":"Two weeks into a three week trip out west and finally have had an outstanding meal. I literally could have ordered anything on the menu. The mushroom-pumpkin soup was really tasty (my wife gave me but one spoonful). Lentil soup was superb. Would order the pomegranate chicken again if I did not want to someday try the whole menu. 
Alas, we live in PA, just a little too far for dinner and a movie. If this place was close to home we would be there all the time. The very friendly owner came by to chat twice during our meal. This is a family owned business: she is Greek, hubby the chef is Italian. Decor is simple and immaculately kept.
Oh yes, don't leave without eating the pumpkin cheesecake."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. I usually visit the location in Centennial Center. The place is small, family run and the food is DELICIOUS! I recommend the pomegranate chicken! Yum!"}
{"text":"Good for a quick bite if you've been shopping in the area but don't expect a lot.  The service is great.  The restaurant could use a little added warmth in decor.  The food is average but well priced.  I would not drive put of my way to go there but I wouldn't drive by if I was hungry"}
{"text":"If you have read any of my other reviews then you know I am all about family owned, non-chain restaurants, so it is no surprise that I liked this place. My mom and I both ordered the pomegranate chicken, myself the entree and her the salad. The food was awesome, the server was very informative and finally, what takes the cake, is Rhonda, the owner, coming over to thank us for trying out her restaurant. Class act, check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food. I will always be a loyal customer. We are always welcomed warmly and the food is always impeccable."}
{"text":"Wow, you are not going to find a better Mediterranean restaurant in the city. Take your time and savory each and every bite. The service was above any we have experienced in such a very long time and they were training two new people. Do youyourself a favor and take a trip to West Lake Mead, we have found a treasure."}
{"text":"Awesome for a to-go lunch or for a sit down dinner. Great gluten-free options and they are so go about cross-contamination. I'd recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Market Grille represents everything that you could ask for in a restaurant. Quality food, nice ambience, great service and good value.Although the emphasis is on Greek specialties, the mix can satisfy almost anyone, especially now that Italian food is available. If you are looking for burgers and pizza, grow up, get over it and try something different. The soups are extraordinary especially the Mushroom Pumpkin flavored with cinnamon. For desert you will find the best rice pudding along with the most delicious Baklava Cheesecake anywhere. This is an old style family enterprise and it shows. One suggestion........go there hungry.......trust me."}
{"text":"Food's great.  People are great. Nothing bad to say about this place.  Good quality food.  I love the filet gyro and stuffed peppers.  It's all good. I haven't had anything bad here."}
{"text":"Husband and I go to this and other location often. One of our favorites. This place has the BEST pita and hummus and all of their dishes definitely satisfy. They do a great job with their staff being knowledgeable about their dishes. All in all--you couldn't keep us away."}
{"text":"Pomegranate chicken salad is way too sweet. We also had Baked chicken which was terribly dry. The hummus is meh. and it's expensive...but all in all it doesn't feel like we'll never try it again. It really seems to have potential."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Market Grill Cafe since they had only one location over by WalMart. Their food is fantastic!  My favorite is the avglomeno soup - a lemon chicken rice soup that is really tasty. The pasta salad is excellent as well. Try the Pomegranate Chicken in either the platter or gyro form - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Market grill cafe is alright. The food isn't the most authentic or highest quality, but its still good. I like the spanikopita and the baklava cheesecake. Unfortunately the gyro meat is only ok. It has a weird taste and it is always mushy, never crispy. The falafel is dry and bland and pretty gritty. There is definitely better greek food in town, especially for the price."}
{"text":"I may not be an expert on greek food, but I know the difference between a great gyro and a gyro I would not want to eat again. There's an array of Mediterranean restaurants within miles that are much much more impressive. 

The meat in the gyro seems like a very poor version of pressed lamb and beef. You are probably better of picking up frozen gyro meat from the local grocery store and making your own.

I'm used to gyros being served with tzatziki sauce, here it's served with a \"yogurt dill\" sauce which is a nice twist, it just doesn't make up for the poor quality of meat. 

My wife got the pomegranate chicken, and I have to admit, it seemed like it had been marinated and poached in POM juice. It was overly sweet without any depth or any presence of seasoning.   

Pros: Friendly staff, reasonable prices
Cons: Poor quality meat, not alot of flavor, hummus was just blah. 

Overall: I will not be returning to Market Grille Cafe for any reason."}
{"text":"I can't believe this was voted as one of Las Vegas Best restaurants. The food was bland, the set up was cafeteria style, only one menu board is available so if there is a line then you better read quick. When I asked to see a menu when we got to the counter to order (you can no longer see any of the menu boards) , I got a nasty look and was told it's up on the wall."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how or why I avoided this place so long.   The name market grille didn't scream Greek food to me.  Oh what a fool I've been. The food is amazing!  I typically start out with a soup and their pumpkin mushroom does not disappoint.  The hint of cinnamon makes it memorable and a new standard for my visits.  Lunch specials are a great value. The pomegranate chicken is pretty good and I love the hummus.  Atmosphere is casual and the waitresses are very friendly with speedy and enjoyable service.   Best of las Vegas"}
{"text":"I was born in Las Vegas and have seen restaurants come and go over the last several decades. I have even worked in restaurants here. I've never seen an owner (name anonymous) work so hard to make sure the quality and purity of his food is top notch and the customer is happy and content. It's seriously like a mission of his to serve those to the best of his and his families ability. That's probably why the food is so consistent and satisfying and the atmosphere is a true dining experience. Thanks again guys. Can't say enough good about you. Just keep doing what you're doing. People, try these guys you won't be disappointed! I'll bet my grape leaves on it."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant. Great food, friendly service. It's a family owned restaurant and everybody is very polite. The lamb gyro is excellent, all of the food is very filling. There are so many options for sides to include or change in your meal, it's overwhelming. The patio is rather small, so it can get crowded with large parties or on busy days. I ended up being seated against a bush, a very awkward foursome lunch since we all had to face the wall. The check took a bit long to receive, but overall a good experience. I would definitely recommend it compared to some other Mediterranean restaurants in the city"}
{"text":"Come here often for lunch usually to go. Great food!! Learned they are starting table service in the evening. Looking forward to that."}
{"text":"Food and service good.  If you are looking for a quick bite and somewhat healthy and not expensive this is your place."}
{"text":"Locally owned and the mediterranean food is fantastic.  We usually order food to go and it's nice to hear the same voices and see the same faces each time we go.

Only downside is they are sometimes closed on and around a few holidays but we don't hold that against them."}
{"text":"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This place with the waiters alone rocks!!!!!Fresh clean, the waiter explained every darn dish on the menu. The hummus and Gyros were awesome!!!! And to seal the deal, the owner came to our table after we were done and gave us a coupon towards our next meal. Yes the owner sat down at our table and she was such a sweetheart, we'll be back again"}
{"text":"Great local spot. The management remembers you if you're regular and they take pride in their food."}
{"text":"Always delicious food and attentive service. Visited on 2/24 and Cassie remembered us from our last visit. I ordered the traditional gyro which is my favorite. It is packed with flavor and freshness. The restaurant has an authentic Greek feel and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried it, and it was terrible.  I lived in a country with a large Greek population and this was not really Greek food, more infused with American.  I ordered the gyros platter as did the rest of the family.  The pita bread was rubbery and plastic.  The contents had absolutely no flavor and had no sauce inside.  I have had gyros before and they have all been tasty and oozing with sauce.  I usually eat anything, but this I did not eat, it was cold.  Took the meat contents out and gave to the dogs when we got home.  Rice was cooked to perfection but  was bland and tasteless.  Salad was good though.  Service was friendly and quick, but that was because there was only a few people there, which is unusual for a Friday."}
{"text":"Market Grille has an extensive menu of Greek and Mediterranean dishes that have great taste, and are filling.  Last time I was here I got a filet gyro and it was delicious.  One tip for a gyro if you like the yummy yogurt sauce they will add some extra sauce for I believe a dollar extra.  Each time I come here I try something new.  Which is about once a month.  I have had lamb, gyros, many varieties available, Greek iced coffee, which hits the spot.  For the lamb kabob that I got I thought it was very good however the portion for dinner and for the price I would think two kabob sticks would be more appropriate.  The staff is super friendly and helpful with making a choice for your meal.  So I see on this app for Market Grille something about %20 off your entire bill after you write something?  Well it seems like I sadly could not take advantage of this deal because I like my privacy and do not want to have my location on for all my apps. Market Grille please contact me about how I can get this because me and my family are very loyal customers. Thank you and see you soon!  Ps I dine at the Lake Mead location."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  Their pomegranate chicken has quickly moved up the list to my favorite food.  It has a great flavor and the chicken is very tender and juicy.  I have tried it both on the salad (yummy!) and the platter which comes with basmati rice, side salad and hummus with pita. I loved it both ways. My friends ordered the chicken and lamb gyros which they reported to be average.  The pumpkin baklava cheesecake is to die for!  Its unique and absolutely wonderful!"}
{"text":"Worst Greek food I've ever had. Me and my husband love Mediterranean food and eat it very often. After seeing some reviews we decided to visit this place. The chicken and lamb skewers were dry and flavourless. The Greek salad was okay. The tzatziki had no garlic or cucumber and was basically dill mixed with yogurt. We ordered falafel and it was way too salty. The pumpkin baklava cheesecake was the only thing that was good. The service was good. The price is high considering the sub standard food they serve. Definitely not worth another visit. And definitely not \"homemade\" Greek food."}
{"text":"Excellent food...OMG - I never knew pomegranate on chicken was even a possibility nevermind how freakin delicious it is!!! 

I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't so far from home. But I will definitely go back when I'm on that side of town!"}
{"text":"We just get the hummus and the gyros everytime because they're so good. Love the punch cards! Reminds me to come in and I'm never sad about that."}
{"text":"Great lunch special for $7.50. I got a chicken gyro and a Greek salad and the other guy I was with got the traditional gyro with fries. Greek salad and gyro was delicious, chicken was tender and flavorful. The fries had a really good seasoning on them as well. Next time I'm in the area I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I'm part Greek so it's in my genes. I know what avgolemono should taste like. The creamy lemon chicken and rice soup is almost like ya-ya used to make.  The pomegranate chicken is sweeeet. I'm a little kid so I don't mind. My dad said the pastisio was light and delish. My mom loved the keftedes. I though they were moist herby and the best I've had."}
{"text":"Love the food and their lunch special! Great decor and everyone is hospitable and friendly!"}
{"text":"So far overpriced it's crazy. Food is only decent at best. Quantity is small. Not much good to say about this place. I went here because the gyro place I usually go was further from home, but I guess it was worth the drive. I know for next time now."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced and great food. Definitely worth a trip to check it out."}
{"text":"It's great Greek food but obviously not the best. The atmosphere is great though. The rice they offer is a bit bland but other than that the rest is great. My family is Greek so I'm sure nothing can compare to homemade Greek food but if you are looking to dine out Greek style, go"}
{"text":"The gyro platter was excellent! Very friendly staff and quick efficient service. I can't wait to come back to town and try it again!"}
{"text":"Finally, 19 months in Vegas/North Las Vegas and finally found  Greek food worth paying for. 25 min drive from our house, but we will definitely make the drive anytime we're in the mood for a great Greek meal. Military discount was icing on the cake."}
{"text":"5 stars for great Greek food but the real reason I love this place is the great service. All employs are always happy to serve and love to suggest menu items."}
{"text":"Good food but for some reason I prefer going to the Lake Mead location. The food seems to taste better and the atmosphere is a bit more welcoming as well."}
{"text":"I don't live on this side of town, and my girlfriend has recently gone gluten-free. This place popped up. So we tried it.
The girl that helped us was genuinely pleasant and explained their system well. The service was great.
There is a lot of variation in Mediterranean cuisine, even if the general items are the same. I found this place to be as described (Greek), which is not always the case for Mediterranean restaurants.
I got their gyro. Very good. My girlfriend got the Spanankopita, which she loved. She tried their pumpkin soup, and loved that as well. 
Their hummus tends to the garlicky side, which I like. I was not too impressed with the flavor and texture of the pita wedges that come with the hummus. I prefer the bread to be in larger pieces and less grilled. 
I'm not too sure about the tv screens showing pictures of food. That seemed a little weird to me. 
Overall a good experience, and we want to return when we are on that side of town again."}
{"text":"Salad was fresh and crisp, chicken was juicy, overall food was great! Service was also very pleasant, Sheena at the register was very friendly, knowledgeable and welcoming. Great experience!"}
{"text":"This place was suggested by my mother in law and I'm glad to have given it a try. I ordered Gyro Mediterranean wrap with a Greek Salad for take out. I couldn't get enough of the salad. It was very fresh and didn't disappoint. I like my salad with a little crunch and it had that. The portion size is great. I was able to eat half now and later. The service is incredible. Very friendly. I would definitely recommend ANOTHER family member or friend!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Delicious food, reasonable prices and convenient locations. I would love it even more if I knew that everything was non GMO. Hopefully someday all restaurants will make that transition."}
{"text":"This is my \"go to\" place to eat for a quick, yummy meal in Vegas. They have vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-fee options, which is awesome if you are eating with friends with dietary restrictions. The veggie kabobs are my all-time favorite, along with the rice (not vegetarian). The lentil soup is the best I have ever had, and the baklava pumpkin cheese cake is light and tasty. 

Note: It does not have a distinct cheesecake flavor, but it's excellent in it's own right. 

One of the best things about this place is the pictures of the food. They truly represent what you will get and are great help in making up your mind. The place is family-owned and operated, and they really do care about the quality and your experience. 

I gave it 4-stars because, as tasty as things are, they are a little heavy handed on the salt, which will bother some. If you are looking for a fresh, local, greek meal in a casual environment with a great price, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Love the food !!! Fresh & yummmy , amazing chicken , great cheap lunch ! Must try cheese with Brandi"}
{"text":"OH this place was soo good! I am a healthy eater, and i recommend for everyone. Usually when I go out, it has to be my 'cheat day' from my workout and eat healthy routine. But this place, I can just stop by for anytime, fill up with lots of healthy food and feel great about it! So yummy and value is great! I took my two 3year old girls. I only order 1 kids meal but portion was perfect that i could sprit between them. 
Staff were so friendly.  Once they learned that it was our first time, they explained their menu really well and the owner came and greeted us!
The food was excellent!"}
{"text":"I gave this place four stars due to the clearly marked gluten-free items on the menu. The food wasn't spectacular, but I truly appreciate the dietary consideration."}
{"text":"Joe and Rhonda Pierro seem like they have a chain 2 chain restaurants because the place is so efficient and effective, but once you look at the menu and see that everything is a homemade recipe from their Italian and Greek origins, you start to realize and appreciate the thoughtfulness and care that went into this business model.

The owners do a great job keeping quality and knowledgeable employees and often will personally greet guests. I told them they should expand, but they actually love what they do and have a genuine commitment to the unique dining experience they provide.

Actual Greek and Italian food under one roof, with a fair price and great atmosphere probably has not been seen since the decline of the Greco-Roman empire. Other people try to do it, and I been around the world many times, but the Market Grille and Cafe is on the money in the way they provide their dining experience and cafe style.

If I had a physically attractive girl with a net worth of 1 billion dollars or more, then I would still take her here and she would love it. I know I can get a dining experience with distinction and class here or a quick bit of food. They even cater, have live music, and everyone acts right because they are well trained and/or the owners know how to both lead and manage.

You really can't have the Market Grille Cafe fail you. It's a top of the line small business and it is a pleasure and honor to know places like this still exist. Will be back unless I die sooner than I am planning on.

I live in Las Vegas. We have a lot of shisty people and businesses...that's what we are known for, among other things, but Joe and Rhonda have a great restaurant. Keep up the good work. Great to see this entity in our city.

I'll stop writing now, but hopefully you get the idea that this is a great and unique place. Food, service, price, atmosphere, ect... are all excellent."}
{"text":"I'm not a big Greek Mediterranean either but let me tell you Market Grille Cafe is amazing that I wrote a really really juicy by the rice has a lot of seasoning in it. The atmosphere is fantastic they have some seating outside also for 8:50 you get a platter with the drinking which is not bad for lunch. this is a place I'll be visiting more often."}
{"text":"Screw Panera Bread. This is FANTASTIC. 
Family run and has lots of family pride!
You'll even see the owner cooking and helping.

This place has an original menu with homemade recipes. 

P.s. the lemon chicken soup they have is making my mouth water thinking about it.  Try the pomegranate chicken it's amazing plain, over rice, or in a salad (i had it plain). And the cheesecake is wonderful. I cannot wait to go back and try the tiramisu. On and they use baklava as the cheesecake \"crust\" ... Genius

Ok I read some negative reviews and some people seem to be \"connesuiers\" ... It's Mediterranean and it's very delicious. For being hand made it's quite inexpensive. (less than $10 for a *filling* lunch)"}
{"text":"Good Solid Greek Restaurant. The best one you will find on the northern part of the city. Gyros are my heroes at this place, you will not be disappointed in ordering one. I really can't complain about any dish on their menu.

P.S. Don't forget desert, its well worth it here."}
{"text":"Ok, so I went to the Lake Mead location. . . I've had a lot of Greek food, and lemme tell you this . . . best I've had this side of Athens.  I went with some friends.  They both got the traditional Gyro plate with Hummus instead of Tzatziki.  Delicious.  I got the sampler plate off the \"Traditional\" menu.  Spanakopita, Souvlaki, and Moussaka.  Even more delicious.  Both mine and theirs were served on a bed of basmati rice, with a side of hummus & pita and a \"Greek Salad\".  Great place, very casual.  As a Greek Pagan, I found the inside done up to suggest hints of a classic greek temple, as opposed to the garish white on blue decor of most Greek places.  Can't wait to go back.  Also, try the baklava . . . it's as if Hestia herself made it.  You have to go there. . . for reals."}
{"text":"One of the best Greek/Mediterranean restaurants ever with amazing food, atmosphere, staff and affordable prices."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and tried something different each time and it was great!  You will have to try the baklava!!  The best I ever had!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this location. Took a minute before we were seated. Place was not busy at all. Before we were seated in a booth, the waitress wiped down the seat first, then the table, then the other seat, all with the same rag. Needless to say, we then requested a table. After waiting 7 miutes without even a drink order, we got up and went to a different Greek restaurant with much better results. Never again will we be back to this location."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today, so good! They are fast, delicious and great value! My boyfriend and I both ordered traditional gyros w/ the yogurt dill sauce & added the platter that includes hummus and pita bread, rice and salad. Everything was so delicious! We have already planned out what we will order next time we come here. Recommend!"}
{"text":"The one thing that impresses me the most about this restaurant is their super excellent service. They definitely make you feel at home! The two girls working there were very helpful giving me suggestions of the different vegan options they have. I love how knowledgable they are with my special diet. For instance, they pointed out that their dolmades is actually cooked (the rice) with chicken broth. They also pointed out that their babaganoush and hummus had some dairy in it (which was disappointing since I love those dishes). I ended up ordering their tabouli and falafel. My friend ordered some babaganoush, hummus, dolmades and greek salad. The falafel was overwhelmingly flavorful (too much spices) and was too salty for both of our palates. The rest of the appetizers were just okay. My rating is mostly based on the service, cleanliness and location of the restaurant. Some of the dishes might be better so I'll give it another chance."}
{"text":"Market Grille Cafe is the reason I fell in love with Mediterranean/Greek food. The food is consistently delicious and truly represents a restaurant that serves its customers in the same way I imagine they would serve food to their family.  

Here is a list of some of my favorite eats at MGC:
Combination Appetizer Platter: Includes hummus, pita bread, mediterranean salad, dolmades, satziki, tabouli, and babaganoush. Can be ordered as appetizer to share and commonly ordered as a meal for individuals. It's hearty, diverse in flavor and texture, and just delicious. 

Dolmades: Stuffed grape leaves. I have yet to find any other Greek/Mediterranean joint that makes them as excellent as MGC does. Here you have a choice of vegetarian or with meat. Both are fantastic.

Falafels: This is yet another thing that MGC cooks extraordinarily well that has yet to be matched in quality by any other place. Crispy on the outside yet moist and bready on the inside - it's like a Greek hush puppy but better. An excellent meaty substitute for non-meat eaters. 

Also not to miss: Mousaka, Stuffed Tomatoes, Stuffed Green Peppers, all of their grilled skewers (my personal favorite is the salmon). 

Still making my way through their entire menu but unfortunately for me, MGC is clear across town. Nonetheless, we still make the trek when the craving for Greek food arises. We met one of the owners by chance during one visit, and pleaded with her and her husband to open another location in the South Las Vegas/Henderson area. In a town that offers every possible type of food and hosts a number of world-renowned culinary venues, Market Grille Cafe easily sits in the top 5 of my list of favorite Las Vegas restaurants."}
{"text":"New favorite Greek place. Ordered Saganaki, hummus, pita bread, 2 baby gyros, a gyro platter, pomegranate chicken, cannoli, and yia yia's cookies. The owner came to our table every 15 minutes making sure everything was okay. Place is super clean and everything is super positive. At the end of our order we got a 15% coupon for our next visit.  Can't wait to come back. Super reasonable too!"}
{"text":"I have been going her for years now. A traditional giro with a humus hits the spot everytime. They have a great family atmosphere and you can the owners there time to time making sure everything is still up to par! Try a baklava and opa!"}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and the restaurant has a nice ambience, but the sagnaki and gyros were not very good. I prefer a pillowy pita, these were thin and dry. The rice was also dry and the salad was bitter. The sagnaki cheese was overwhelmed by the taste of liquor."}
{"text":"First time here I ordered the Greek salad with chicken.  The chicken was good but the romaine lettuce was a bit soggy it wasn't to bad but you can tell it was sitting with the dressing for awhile.  It was during lunch time when I went so maybe they prepared it before hand.  I will be back but I will mention it the next time I come.  Staff are really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Once again a fabulous restaurant has been so close to me and I'm just finding it. I just ordered the eggplant Parmesan which came with spaghetti and Pita bread.  I also added the Tiramisu cheesecake and surprisingly I pay no more than $18. The staff was friendly and very helpful, I also received a coupon for my next visit. I will definitely be back.  Also if you are a vegetarian or pescatarian like myself  you will really love this fabulous menu!! family owned excellent excellent"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a busy saturday. Great service and delicious food. I had the Greek salad with gyro meat with a side of tzaziki sauce. Yum :) and my friend had pomegranate chicken . Easily cleared our plates ! Desserts were also delicious !"}
{"text":"Super fresh food & great friendly staff! Love the Pom chicken salad! pretty much everything is good from here."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Greek food, but I absolutely LOVE Market Grille Cafe. Their food is fantastic & prices are reasonable. My favorite is the lamb gyro. It tastes authentic & delicious. I've been to Kabob shops all over Europe & it was like being back there. The hummus & pita bread are also delicious. It's a favorite in Vegas"}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  We have eaten here several times.  Wish they had more variety though."}
{"text":"Would definitely go back.  The chicken gyro was fresh, tasty, and the falafel and salad was the icing on the cake.  Service was quick (I did take out), and helpful.  I think it was pretty obvious that it was my first time in there.  Docking a star because it was a little pricey, but I would say it's worth a shot.  Also, they take good pride in their hummus (it was tastey), but doesn't need to overpower the chicken!

Check it out though!

Cheers,
Jared"}
{"text":"Home made Greek food. The different flavored Hummus dishes are really good.  The signature Pomegranate Chicken is worth trying. Gyros are moist and tender. Friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"We love it here! The servers are very friendly and are always happy to answer questions and offer suggestions. The atmosphere is nice and they have outdoor seating for when the weather is right. The watermelon salad is delicious and refreshing (possibly seasonal so don't miss out) Gyro plate is always tasty and the skewers (salmon, filet, salmon) are my personal favorites. I liked the few things I've tried so much that I haven't really had a chance to explore the rest of the menu. Oh well, there's always next time."}
{"text":"Recently moved out of Vegas and seriously miss Market Grill Cafe. They have great homemade Greek food and a very friendly staff. I especially like that you can order either the entree portion (which includes a small hummus and pita, rice and salad) or ala carte (by itself),
My favorite is the Pomegranate Chicken. Whether its in the wrap, a salad or just by itself, you can't go wrong. I also highly recommend the Stuffed Tomatoes, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 
Hard to find good, authentic, homemade Greek food and I miss ordering take out from here weekly."}
{"text":"Ok then.  I reviewed many of the other reviews and thought I was in for a treat.  What a disappointment.  I have eaten here before, when the restaurant was in a corner off of centennial parkway. I didn't think it was that good then either, but I thought I would give it another try,

I ordered the traditiomal gyro platter.  It came with rice, salad, pita slices and dipping sauce, and a gyro pita sandwich.  I tried the rice first.  It was bland and dry.  The salad was good, at least the lettuce was fresh.  They gave me some little slices of pita bread and a little bit of dipping sauce.  Once again, bland. Then I tried the gyro.  It looked great.

Now I have eaten quite a few gyro sandwiches from different restaurants and am usually satisfied with the taste.  The meat (lamb in my case) is what makes the sandwich.  Oh my gosh what a surprise.  The meat barely had any flavor at all!  Additionally,  it didn't look like it was completely cooked and was very light colored.  It was so bland I didn't even eat half of the gyro.  Very disappointed.

I'll give you that the place is nicely decorated and the service staff was good, but the food just didn't cut it.  Prices could be better too, but they weren't that bad.

Won't be going back here, not while Paymons and my favorite, Yassou Grill on charleston/buffalo are still open.  The food at those two is much better than here."}
{"text":"Appetizer Dolmades we're pretty big size not very flavorful and little dry however the Saganaki this is the Greek cheese simmered with lemon and Brandy's in a flaming skillet serve with pita bread and it was wonderful. Happy all a cart pomegranate chicken which was a great meal very moist great flavors a pomegranate walnut mixture. Service was very friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Had the lunch special, gyro (traditional) with side of fries. The meat was tender, the pita was really good. Fries were done right. Not greasy/oily but was cooked through. Most were crispy outside and tender inside. Also got an order of hummus and pita. Hummus was decent. The decor is great! They spent a lot of time dressing this place up. I really like how they displayed their menu in light boxes. And look at the detail on the flooring and the walls by the booths. You order before seating. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh Greek food!  So far, the best Greek I've had in Vegas.  The decor, the food, the service...awesome.  I wanted to order everything on the menu, but finally decided on the combination platter, an app platter with hummus, baba ganoush, dolmades, Greek salad, tabbouleh, and pita bread.  Sooo good!!  Even though it'll be hard, save room for dessert.  You won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  I've never ordered something that wasn't delicious!  The stuffed tomatoes are wonderful, I love the stuffed grape leaves, the pomegranite chicken is amazing, the baklava cheesecake is delicious.  My daughter has to do gluten free so I invited her here and she was delighted to see that they have a great GF menu.  My husband is a vegetarian and they also had a vegetarian menu. I keep trying other places in the area but always come back here because the food is so good.  I love the decor, the wine and the bar.  The service has always been outstanding and I wish I had taken the servers names so I could post them but I forgot.  But they've all been good.  This is always my favorite local place to go and I'll go back again and again."}
{"text":"I ordered the Greek Salad with chicken from the Lake Mead store and the chicken was dry and did not taste good at all.  I expressed my concern to the restaurant and never heard back.  

I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Tried this place with my girlfriend a few days back because we were craving Greek food. The food and iced tea were great, but we left feeling a little hustled by the end of it.

We both decided we wanted gyros and dessert but the waitress pushed appetizers until we were caught in a bind of saying \"sure,\" so we got a plate of the \"Platos Potatoes.\" They were decent steak-cut fries but very salty. That whole interaction is what took off one star from my review.  Though the waitress was super nice and thorough, we said right off the bat that we wanted entrees and dessert, and that we would skip the apps. Why not listen to the customer? No, we didn't have to say yes to apps but she wasn't taking no for an answer.

Our gyros were great (my lady got the traditional and I got the chicken.) We also ordered a slice of their \"award winning\" baklava crust cheesecake to go. It was interesting, but not my favorite off the wall cheesecake flavor. I think I would have liked a cannoli.

The second star comes off with the menu. There are several items listed as vegan that have dairy products listed in their descriptions. If it isn't actually vegan, why is that V there? It would make me nervous to eat here if I had an allergy or dietary restriction, or even a gluten intolerance just because the menu is blatantly wrong and potentially misleading.

We will probably check out the other location sometime when our next Greek food craving hits, but this one kind of left a bad taste in our mouths."}
{"text":"Take out order usually suffer a little for oblivious reasons, but this take out was a really good one.  I do have to say the market grille cafe did well this time.
  Called in and ordered the 
    Lentil soup
    Pomegranate chicken spinach salad
    Greek trio platter 
    Baklava
When I arrived the order was ready.  The girl behind the counter was friendly and very thorough on making sure my Order was correct.  I mean every single item was checked. I appreciate that considering once you leave coming back is a real pain for take out.
   Food?  Well it was delicious!  Lentil soup was pretty good.  The trio was awesome.  Salad was nice , humus and pita was good even though I'm not a big fan of that food.  The moussaka was soo good,  the other two I got mixed up. The one with the pasta noodles was also very nice.  The other with spinach was a little over powering.  
   My fiancé had the pomegranate chk salad.  She liked it a lot.  To much spinach for me though.  
   One thing for sure was the baklava was very good!   So savory. I mean I enjoyed every bit.  So, after this I would say I'm going back for seconds"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! I've loved it ever since their doors opened years ago. Every time I go, I have to get either the lentil or avgolemono soup... or both! So delicious."}
{"text":"I really do like going here or ordering out. All I have is the Greek salad. I wish I could figure out the dressing recipe, I swear I could drink it! I have had the gyros and few other things too. Everything on the menu is fresh and tasty. Also the service is friendly too. They play a lot of Greek music, so be ready to get your full Greek experience on. They also yell \"Opah!\" a lot, which is cool. If you want something fresh and Greek, go here. They have vegan and gluten free menus too, which I find helpful."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place. Boyfriend & I came here because we needed a gyro fix. I ended up getting a gyro wrap, and it was delicious. Everything was so fresh. Boyfriend got the traditional gyro (mix of lamb & beef) and he said it was the best gyro he's ever had. The yogurt dill sauce was good & boyfriend said the hummus was too. (I don't like hummus so I can't comment) they had a kids menu & my daughter got the pizza. She said it was good. 

Service was great & ambiance is nice too. Ended up paying $27.00 for all three entrees & 2 drinks. Definitely worth it. Of course I forgot to \"check in\" until after we paid so i missed the 20% off deal. But I'm not worried because I know we'll be back again."}
{"text":"Good basic Mediterranean food at a good price. Nothing fancy but the people seem friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious Greek food . Can't wait to go there again.
Fast service, great ambiance & great food. 
Next plate on the menu for next week 
I'll make sure  I get to eat  all of what's on the menu."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and great staff. I had a traditional gyro platter. Very pricey for what you actually get. The food was ok, but nothing compared to the Mad Greek in Baker, CA."}
{"text":"Market Grille Cafe is our new go to place to eat. We went to this location for the first time. We were greeted by very friendly employees. The Owner came to our table to see how everything was. Very impressive. The food was excellent. only wish they would have had Vegetarian Moussaka.  Even my picky eater grand babies enjoyed the food. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Love love love their food. It can be a tad pricey but their greek salad is amazing. I often flop between that or a traditional gyro with the greek yogurt sauce. Also, do yourself a favor and order the Platos Potatoes! They are amazing! (The dipping sauce is a bit spicy) Also, get the pumpkin cheescake, you'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"AMAZING BEYOND WORDS.... I will admit that it has taken me longer than it should have to eat at the Market Grille Cafe, and I am sorry it took so long.  Describing the food as incredible just does not do it enough justice.  There are very few places that I have eaten at over my 40+ years that serve food that has so much depth of flavor.  

I started with the pumpkin mushroom soup and honestly, I could have just eaten that all day long.  Quite possibly the best soup I have ever had.  I then moved into the entree where I had the pomogranate chicken and it about knocked me out of my chair.  The chicken was so tender, moist and the flavor was intoxicating.  I honestly could have eaten like 10 chicken breasts cooked this way.  Wow, what an amazing treat.  Then to finish off the experience I had the baklava cheesecake.  I was told that this dessert won an award at a food competition and I do not doubt it at all.  It was as lucious as it gets.  What an amazing way to finish.  The experience was basically a food orgasm.  

The Market Grille Cafe is a family owned business with two locations in town and the service and hospitality of ALL of the people that work there is just as impressive as the food.  The MGC has it all, atmosphere, hospitality, and most importantly incredible food.  If that was not enough the prices for the food are as economically friendly as it can be.  The MGC is very wallet friendly.  I do not know how they do it for so little but they do. I spend just as much or more for fast food and do not get anything close to this in quality.  

I am a huge Gyro fan so my next visit I am definitely going to try one.  I saw someone else having one and asked how it was and they said it was outstanding and the best they ever had.  I cannot say I am surprised.  

I urge all of my Yelpers out there to visit the Market Grille Cafe and enjoy the same amazing experience I had.  

Run, don't walk and get yourself into the Market Grille Cafe."}

{"text":"I ended up eating at this place by chance.  It happened to be located in the same small plaza as a couple of my other favorite eateries: Panera and Chipotle.  I pulled into the parking lot with the intention of eating at Panera, but because of the small concentration of popular establishments, there was no parking available directly in front of Panera.  So I found myself parked in front of a place called the Market Grille Cafe, advertising Greek and Mediterranean food.  Mmmm, I thought, that sounds good.  And in I went.

It's a similar style eatery as Panera.  You order and pay at the counter, and then you take a number and find your own table and sit down to wait for someone to bring you the food.  I liked the fact that Greek music was playing over the speakers.  It provided an authentic feel.

If I had not been determined to stick to my vegetarian and fish diet, I would have ordered the herb roasted chicken and potatoes, because that sounds truly awesome, but instead I ordered a veg-a-nini ($6.95) and a small village greek salad ($5.95). The veg-a-nini was served and cut like a miniature pizza on pita bread.  The toppings included spinach-basil pesto, chopped kalamata olives, grilled red onions, and crumbled feta cheese.  It was light and flavorful.

The only difference between the regular greek salad and the village greek salad is that the village greek salad contains no romaine lettuce.  I have nothing against romaine lettuce (in fact, I love it), but authentic greek salads don't contain any lettuce, and I thought this would be a rare opportunity to enjoy an authentic greek salad.  Alas, while the ingredients were authentic, the cucumber and tomatoes were served diced rather than sliced and in wedges.  The feta was also crumbled rather than served in chunks or in a large slice atop the salad.  Unfortunately, the way the ingredients are prepared and served changes the experience of the flavors and taste of the dish.  It still tasted good, but not as delicious as an authentic presentation would have been.  If I had known that the tomatoes and cucumber would be diced, I would have ordered the regular greek salad with the romaine lettuce for the same price, although I fear the romaine lettuce might be served shredded.

Before I left, I ordered baklava to go.  A generous portion of this sweet nutty dessert is $4.75.  I enjoyed it.

Based on the overall menu and my expectations, I really wanted to give this place four stars.  Based on my experience, I can only give it three."}
{"text":"Aside from the wait staff being so welcoming (I get the same waitress every time and she is so friendly and bubbly), the food is great! 

As a person who has never tried Greek food outside of trying it at this restaurant (thus having nothing to compare it to), I would still say that this place has delicious foods! I was vegan for a year and eating out with others was very difficult for me, but this place has so many great options for vegans! I usually get the lentil soup and they always ask if I want the cheese off, knowing that it is a vegan dish. :) I also get the hummus and pita bread and its so good! I usually get the trio with my family. The warm pita paired with the zesty-tangy hummus makes my mouth so happy! 

The atmosphere is nice and definitely a good restaurant to try out if you are in the mood for Greek or something different from fast food. (Some dishes may be a little \"sour\" for people if you are sensitive to Greek yogurt, dill, or lemon. Just order a more savory dish if you don't like lemon.)"}
{"text":"Here's the problem: the meal was tasty, the staff and service nice as well. But my wife and got got wicked sick from the food. My bathroom time for the next 3 days was as liquified as the hummus and looked just like the babaganoug. I hate to spend time and money on food that makes me unable to eat anything for days after!

I liked the cafe style setup. Why not? Order at the front, get your cup and wait for the food to be delivered. The staff was helpful, the ambiance kitchy but it is a greek place so I should have expected crappy murals of the Parthenon and fake grapevines.

We ordered the mezza platter and the traditional gyro. The platter came with hummus, baba, romaine salad, falafel and grape leaves (we ordered 2 hot with lamb and 1 gold veggie.) All in all the apps were ok. I make way better hummus at home. Their's was VERY loose. Too much water, overpowered by garlic as well. The babaganoug lacked any smokiness. I wonder if they grilled the eggplant? it almost tasted canned.
The rest was ok. Salad was sloppy, the grapeleaves good and the falafel nice and crispy. The toasted pita tasted fresh too.

The gyro was an inyourface suckerpunch of greek flavors. Very high in sodium, but went down well with a side of extra tzaziki. I like gyros but often get tired of too much going on in the meat. it was bordering on over seasoned/oversalted. Maybe it's just me.

The manager and staff came by to offer refills, check on the food, and clear the plates. They were all very nice.

Then the thunder struck. Both of us got hit hard at the same time in 2 separate locations. Poor Sarie was at WORK when she felt the bubble guts! I at least was at home and could sit on the pot for an hour. The next three days were very sketchy for me on my motorcycle. Lets just say there were more than a few unscheduled stops on my routes to look for a bathroom.

I'm gonna take a while before I try this place again. Maybe next time get everything cooked extra well done and stay away from the cold apps and fresh veggies/fruit."}
{"text":"El terriblay. Some of my pita bread chips were hard as if three were left over from breakfast and just conveniently added to my meal. They seemed old. The gyro... super not great. There were piles of meat on top of meat but that still doesn't make up for a basic 'do it yourself' tasting gyro. The basmati rice tasted funny. I wish I could find a Taziki's somewhere. Their food is amazing. Some lady who acted like she ran the place treated one couple like they were future investors, ignored my table and was rude to employees in her horrid attempt to cater to the table of the \"future investor\" couple. Note to this restaurant... every customer is important, treat your employees with dignity, and DO NOT serve old pita."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the traditional gyro and stuffed grape leaves and al were delicious. Good prices too."}
{"text":"They gave my boyfriend and I burnt chicken . 
Service was awful . The first time I came here it was really good. Unfortunately I will not come back Again."}
{"text":"I am not  person who likes Greek food. In my opinion, I find their food to be weird and a bit on the vegetarian side of things.
But, that was until I tried Market Grille. This place has authentic (and I mean it) Greek food with people who are well read on the foods that you cannot even pronounce. I personally had the Gyro Pizza. The gyro pizza was very unexpected when received. They're small pizzas with a chock full of sausage and weird things I could not contemplate. I will revise this review as soon as I get back and I'm less in a rush of things. Thus far, this place is fantastic considering the quality and price."}
{"text":"Las Vegas is a vapid wasteland when it comes to good Greek food.  The Market Grille Cafe fills a much needed niche here.  Their Gyros are awesome, the only criticism I would give is they tend to pack a bit too much lettuce in compared which seems that they are skimping on the meat.  The greek fries are also great as they are seasoned perfectly.  The dipping sauce they have is awesome.

On the down side, by wife and I have tried their tabouli 3 separate times, and each time, it was spoiled.  It wasn't just a matter of it being a bit old, it was flat out stinky and nasty.  The first two times we brought it back to the restaurant (carry out) and they confirmed it had spoiled and gave us a refund.  The third time we just gave up lol.

A few times some of our items have had tomatoes in them and they were mealy.  Not good :(

Overall, the place puts out decent food, just stay away from the tabouli."}
{"text":"Yum! Food is so fresh and pretty quick when order. Always know what to expect food has so much flavor. They make the best hummus. Taziki is a bit garlicie. But the salads are amazing, lots of greens and flavor. always a clean place to eat and to go orders present just as well as dine in. The ladies at counter are always helpful and quick."}
{"text":"This is our second time eating here and we love their hummus and gyros. They have a nice lunch special, too. Clean, nice environment and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their food is wonderful and lots of variety! I eat here at least 5 times per month. Great go to place when there is no time to cook. Rest assured you will have a home cooked a great tasting meal ! I have been a patron of this restaurant when they first opened and I have always enjoyed coming here as do my children. Thank you!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and WOW! My boyfriend and I are huge Mediterranean food fans but it's always hard to find some that is actually good. This place killed it. My boyfriend got the gyro wrap with fries and I got a traditional gyro with rice. We also got hummus as an appetizer and a cannoli for desert. Everything was phenomenal. Even the prices were great. The service was excellent and quick. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We are always pleased with the food here. I'm particularly fond of the pomegranate chicken spinach salad. The saganaki is really good and is on the happy hour specials. The pita is homemade and they are always generous with bringing more. 
Great little family-owned spot, friendly staff, reasonable prices, and high quality food."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here with my mom today and it was delicious! The restaurant decor was very cute and our server was very friendly and helpful. She told us the story of the Greek owners and how everything is homemade. I ordered the veggie wrap and it came with a Greek salad - it was all delicious. There are so many other things I'd love to try on the menu so I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Craving a Greek salad, so decided to try out this restaurant.  I asked for a Greek salad and lentil soup with a side of hummus.  Spent nearly 15 dollars and got very little salad, a little soup and a dollop size of hummus.  Needless to say, left there still hungry....Crew working not very helpful and didn't even smile.  Went down the street to Northside Nathan's and had a fantastic downtown Greek salad which surpassed Market Grille's portion and better pricing.  Sorry."}
{"text":"We eat here about once a month.  The service is always good.  Much of the food is mediocre.  The salad is always too finely chopped.  The gyros are a frozen product and not a very good one at that.  The hummus is watered down.  Mousaka and spanakopita are both pretty good."}
{"text":"I have been a frequent visitor to Market Grille over the past 12 months, going several times a month to get their delicious food.

Unfortunately, something must have changed in the past month or so. I almost always get take-out, but the past 2 orders have been either incomplete or unfulfilled completely.

A few weeks ago, I ordered a traditional gyro lunch special with drink. The guy behind the counter could not understand a single thing on the phone, having to repeat myself multiple times. When I picked up my order, I did not have my drink when I departed. I had to drive 10 minutes back to the restaurant to pick it up (partly my fault - should of known my drink wasn't there). However, the issue with the same employee was no apologies or understanding of what had just happened. He was completely dumbfounded!

The second instance was just this morning. I called to make my order and told 15-20 minutes to get it ready. No problem. I show up 15 minutes later and there is NO record of my order! The young lady behind the desk, again seemingly clueless, is unable to log onto her computer to see what is going on. While this is transpiring, she is answering 2 phone calls (not putting them on-hold) instead of taking care of the in-presence customer. I patiently wait, but finally give up and cancel my would-be order. She offered to get the manager, but I politely declined (I should have). 

I'm not sure what is going on. Customer service at this place used to be 5 stars ALL the time. Recently, something is amiss. Either management has dropped the ball (inconveniently twice for me) or they are hiring people with zero social skills.

This is quite a shame. Whatever happened to the \"Best of Las Vegas\"? No awards since 2014..."}
{"text":"We've never been disappointed by the pomegranate chicken (salad, sandwich or entree!) or the gyros (any).  Recently we tried the pumpkin mushroom.  SO good!  The potatoes they serve on the side are great too.  Everything tastes fresh and flavorful.  I'm looking forward to trying the roasted chicken and gyro soup next time!  Bonus that they post their nutrition info without request.  

Great customer service here.  They're always friendly, accomodating and the overall appearance of the restaurant is warm, cozy and clean."}
{"text":"We have loved this place since it first opened on Centennial Center.  Excellent quality food.  What I like the most is that you can tell it's \"family\" owned and operated."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and our server was very friendly. I'm definitely going back. I just wish the chairs were more comfortable."}
{"text":"This place has some awesome food, glad we randomly decided to come here, now it's our go to place for Mediterranean food. Shena was amazing! She helped us out with the menu and answered our million questions. Great staff great food! We will be back! The pomegranate chicken & Mama Mia Chicken are amazing!"}
{"text":"Market Grille is awesome!! I love their food and most of all their customer service!!  I was at sprouts across the street and decided to order for pick up. Sherry I believe her name was answered the phone and told me my order would be ready as soon as I arrived. When I got their my order was ready!! Man it was quick! I just got the gyro platter mmm it was delicious! Come check this place out guys!"}
{"text":"Very delicious! My fiancé is not a big fan of hummus, but now he loves the hummus here. The traditional gyros is very yummy."}
{"text":"We have been here many times both at this location and the one on North Durango. It is a welcome alternative to the typical choices in this price range. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is pleasant. And the food is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been to both locations several times and the food is always good. You have the choice to either eat very healthfully or to take the other route until you are full beyond capacity. 
The atmosphere is always pleasant and the music is typically a Greek theme or at least mellow.
Love it!"}
{"text":"This is a mom and pop place and I have supported them as they have moved locations and grown over the past decade. Their wait staff is always most pleasant and helpful. One of the owners actually came over to our table with numerous questions to assure he was able to accommodate one of our party who suffers severe food allergies. Now let's talk food. I swear they have changed some of their recipes and age old standbys like hummus or basmati rice have, in order, yogurt and lemon added. Why ruin a good thing? I originally came for the traditional fare and have no need of a modernized version. I still love their attitude, but the food has suffered."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Very very friendly staff. They are accompanying and listen when you make requests. Many times other places look over modifications you ask for. I've done in and done take out both very pleasant experiences."}
{"text":"Our first visit. Friday night, and very few customers. Hostess sat us in an empty area on the casual side, without even asking if we wanted to be in the real dining room where the live entertainment was, so we had to ask the waitress to reseat us. She was very nice. Portions were good size, but everything (Both meals) was VERY bland. Just no flavor. Nothing like really good Greek food. Not impressed."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to dinner here one night because no other restaurant around it was open at the time. We are really glad we ended up here. The service was great and the food was delicious. I also may mention that their prices are very affordable!"}
{"text":"We found this place by accident today. We were going to Panera Bread Co. but nothing on their menu caught our eye. Then we spotted this place from across the parking lot. 

The service was great! Friendly and professional. Our server explained what some of the dishes were and also gave us recommendations. We started out with pita bread slices and a flaming cheese appetizer. Excellent! For our entrees, my husband had the pomegranate chicken and I had the traditional gyro platter. Everything was delicious but I know exactly what I'm ordering next time: Pomegranate chicken salad. OMG! That has to be the BEST chicken I've EVER had!

We ended up getting desserts to go after we got through with our meals. I ordered the pumpkin cheesecake with baklava crust and my husband got the cannoli. The cost of our meal was pretty reasonable -- less than $50 (before tip). That included two soft drinks, an appetizer (happy hour price), two entrees (salads included), and two desserts. 

I'm writing this review while I'm laying in bed because the restaurant doesn't have recliners, pillows, and blankets for their customers after dinner. (Burp!!!) I'm looking forward to going back here again soon."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about the Market Grille. 

First, the good: staff and atmosphere. Our server, Carol, was excellent. She explained everything to us, was attentive, and even picked up a toy our 11-month old dropped. The restaurant itself was beautiful and comfortable. Food was delivered quick.

The not-so-good: the food. It was underwhelming. I got the gyro with a side of fries and my husband got the spanakopita, and we tried their baklava. My meal was basically boring; no flavors, other than the raw onions, stood out. The meat was tender and moist, but lacked flavor; the pita bread was nice though. The spanakopita was not memorable either. The baklava was enormous, but it was gritty - maybe from too much brown sugar, we're not sure. We didn't finish any parts of our meal.

We were very disappointed. We usually go to Paymon's, but it's a bit of a trek from our house, so we were hoping the Market Grille could be a substitute, but alas, it cannot compete with Paymon's."}
{"text":"I'm basically a regular now. Well, when I can afford to spend any money (college student here). 

Anyways, I have a sensitive stomach. So greasy and heavy foods are basically poison. I'll eat them but I can't eat for several hours afterwords because it feels like a rock in my stomach. This place leaves me feeling full, but fresh. Love it. It's clear all of their foods are made with fresh ingredients. Little to no grease from what I order (pomegranate chicken gyro platter and hummus appetizer). Their salads are awesome, portions are good. And I cannot get pomegranate chicken anywhere else lol. I'm slightly addicted. 
The service is ALWAYS friendly btw. I have been there numerous times in different times of the day and they are always very nice and attentive to me. Their ice tea tastes so fresh too! Pretty sure it's brewed. Too good to come from syrup. 
I also work in fast food and I'm constantly trying to spot anything dirty (force of habit), but this place is always clean. 
I would definitely recommend this place. 
And for the specialized dieters, they have vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options as well!!!!!"}
{"text":"Debbie was amazing! Literally some of the best service we've received in years. The food was fresh and delicious! Definitely will come again! Thank you!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place, our absolute favorite!
The food is great, high quality and fresh.
The atmosphere is really nice, and CLEAN!
The staff is very accommodating and friendly.
We eat here at least twice a week, if not more often. The baklava and the cheese cakes are to die for. Haven't been dissapointed yet!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was amazing.  Gyro was excellent fresh ingredients.  The grape leaves were simply awesome."}
{"text":"*** Nice neighborhood choice for good food. ***

I woke up today craving something healthy.
Market Grille Cafe 'Greek Trio' hit the spot.
It includes all three of the following dishes:

Spanakopota ... cheesy spinach flaky pastry
Pastitsio ... macaroni, beef and cheese pie
Mousaka ... beef, eggplant w/ cheese dish

This entree was served with Greek salad,
Basmati herb rice, hummus & pita bread.
This really satisfied my hunger.  It's good.

I ordered (4) Yia Yia's cookies for dessert,
butter cookies with powdered sugar. (yay)
I guess we'll call these \"Greek biscotti\"s. ;p
These go well with an after meal macchiato.

*** A solid \"goto\" spot on my Vegas list. ***"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is outstanding, so reasonably priced & the service is always so good!!! Since moving to Vegas, I've noticed the hospitality industry is lacking actual hospitality! Not here! They are too kind! Highly recommend the pomegranate chicken!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Healthy options and just good food. Service is great all the time and friendly. Also a great Happy hour"}
{"text":"My family and I love going to this place because of the lunch special. It's affordable when you have more than 2 people. Their gyros are good and I love their Greek salad. I haven't gone on the weekend yet but I know for sure their food are delicious. Customer service is up there. Staff is friendly and courteous. I would definitely go back which I have done."}
{"text":"We saw an ad on the TV at Las Vegas Athletic Club offering a discount for members and thought we would give this place a try.  Went on a Sunday only to find out they were closed.  (I think they are now open again on Sundays)

We tried again at about 5:00pm on a week day and loved everything. A funny combination of servers and self-serve.  The servers were all very helpful and nice.  We found no problem with the prices and with the discount for gym members, you can pay for your gym membership with the money you can save if you eat there a few times a month.

Wine price was very reasonable and the decor was simple but warm and friendly.  We had a very good first time experience and will be back again."}
{"text":"My sister & bro. in law brought us to this restaurant. He recommended ordering the Pomegranate Chicken plate so I did. The marinate & the texture of the chicken is so delicious! We also ordered the Saganaki a Greek imported cheese it is so good! My 8 year old daughter could not stop eating it. A very friendly staff & clean. Thank you for satisfying our tummy. We surely come back to this place when we do come back to LV."}
{"text":"Coming in we could not decide if eating in or taking it to go. We decided to eat after seeing the seating area.  Bathroom was clean. Stuff was friendly and nice. The food came out separately like my salad first. When I was pretty much done with my salad the kid's food came out. Once she was about a quarter of the way done the our food came out. The food was good, not great but good. It was good enough to the point to which we would visit it again. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Great, the boba was fresh and taste, service excellent, price and portions outstanding.  Even better deal is go for happy hour 1/2 hors d'oeuvre and wine afternoon mon-fri."}
{"text":"I love this greek joint and I'm from Chicago's greek town.  Awesome food great staff decent prices 
This is my lunch spot during work days"}
{"text":"Poor excuse for greek food.
Ordered veggie kabob platter. Came with two of the smallest skewers I have seen. Flavor was good though. \"Side\" of hummus was about 1 tablespoon of hummus , no joke. Basmati rice was horrible, too salty with terrible aftertaste.  Greek salad was good. Over priced and average. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I usually get a chicken skewer platter or traditional gyro and it's delicious. I do find the hummus a bit bland."}
{"text":"This place was a nice discovery for us. I really enjoy the vibe of the restaurant, and the hospitality is wonderful. 

Definitely get the hummus with fresh pita, it's a great start to the meal. For my main dish I tried the pastitsio and a steak skewer. The steak was cooked perfectly, and I mean perfectly. Better than I've had at some high end steakhouses. My only knock on the food was the pastitsio. It had good flavor, but was served barely above room temperature, so after the first couple bites it just did not hold up very well. 

All in all, Market Grill Cafe has earned a spot in our usual rotation of places for their variety of dishes , quality of ingredients, and their top class hospitality."}
{"text":"I have been to this overpriced restaurant several times but tonite i needed id to  buy a 15 dollar meal. Its ridiculous no restaurant ever asked me for id. I will never patronize this place again. Rude and disrespectful."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I went to pick up an order and the girl at the counter didn't acknowledge me until I said something. She then apparently forgot I was waiting there because she was getting confused about someone else's order. Very incompetent. I mean I could understand if you feel flustered sure, but this girl was rude about it when I asked for an update on my food that I called 15min ahead of time. I'd rather go to their other location."}
{"text":"Pomegranate chicken gyro + 1/2 order of Plato's Potatoes = A-OK
Chicken was very dry, and the main reason I got the gyro over the wrap was the addition of Feta- of which there was so little it didn't really matter.
Fries were seasoned well, and paired with a spicy yogurt sauce. Fries were tastier without the sauce, but it wasn't bad.

Order was takeout, and staff present was just okay- walked in and wasn't addressed for a while, was helped by the manager who eventually asked if I was ready while other employees ignored me. I seemed to be interrupting their closing duties and conversation, my bad.

The spanakopita and avgolemeno soup sound tasty, but I'll likely try another location.
I agree with Betty W's review calling their pricing \"ballsy'- $13 is a bit high for my meal, $4 to add on a veggie skewer is ri-donk."}
{"text":"This Mediterranean restaurant has great food. I especially love their homemade soups!

The downside:

There is no table service (i.e., no wait staff). You order and pay with the cashier, take a number, and wait for your food to be brought to you by a food runner. You also help yourself to the beverages at the beverage station. Some people may not mind that there isn't table service. For me, it just feels a little like I should be in a fast food restaurant.

The cost is not proportionate for the size of the food order. Quality is not an issue. The food tastes great. I had a small bowl of homemade Pumpkin Mushroom soup for $6.00. The soup was fantastic - all 5-6 spoonfuls of it! He had a small Pomegranate Chicken Spinach Salad for $10.50 that is served on a small 7\" plate. The salad was a very good, high priced appetizer. I had the Lamb Roast Cabernet, which was heavenly for $13.00. He had the Lamb Souvlaki, which is a grilled lamb skewer for $12.00. It does not come with enough lamb to be worthy of the price. Entree's come with a miniature greek salad, rice, hummus & pita bread.

The ultimate self-serve fountain station costs $3.00 per person. The ambiance is nice - no complaints there."}
{"text":"A little gem in this side of town. I am glad my friend took me here. Its a casual restaurant where you order at the cashier and pay then take your seat and they will serve the food to you except your drinks, they have soda vending machine. Very helpful and friendly staff. This place is sort of a fast food set up but the food is delicious. They have a lunch menu for $9 and the selection is desirable. I picked the pomegranate chicken and my friend got the traditional gyro wrap plate. It comes with a large drink. This place has enough staff to attend to you immediately. I've never waited for anything. It was my friends birthday and I ordered their gluten free pumpkin cake with a baklava crusting. It was the best! Very creamy and yet the whip cream wasn't too sweet. The waiter came with a candle and match! Very polite staff. I felt like I just sniffed my plate of pomegranate chicken, it disappeared ! Not even a dot of morsel left. I like the sauce and the sweet taste. Try this! And because I liked it a lot I even took a gyro sandwich home. I will definitely come back in this place."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming here and I'm going to have to say, I like it! The first time, I went  with a friend, and we both really enjoyed it. The atmosphere reminded me of my own mother's house! Clean and nicely decorated.  We went around 7pm so it was semi quiet. We ordered at the counter, which is fine with me. The Menus are right there on the wall for you with colorful pictures of the food displayed above. We decided to share and ordered two soups, the gyro stew and lentil soup with 1 lamb and 1 chicken Souvlaki (skewers) platters. We got our drinks and headed for a booth. The soup came to the table almost immediately and both were hot and delicious. Within 6-8 min after that, the Souvlaki's arrived. They came with grilled veggies and the meat was hot and so tender....yum!!! Platters come with rice, chopped greek salad, a side of hummus and soft pita bread. We were asked at least 4 times how we were doing. It may sound like overkill, but you never know when you might need something and they seem to try to keep you seated so your not having to wonder around and keep you happy enough that you aren't waving someone down. All you have to do for yourself is get your drink! We also decided that we were just a tad bit still hungry and ordered the kalamata and cheese. It was all so perfect!!! Very pleased. I, then, went for lunch with my brother and mother. Let the shinanagins begin. My family is pretty particular. We got in and I proceed to direct them through the menu and made suggestions and took charge of ordering (it's better that way! Trust me!) We got the falafal gyro, the traditional gyro (lamb/beef combo meat) platters and a greek salad with chicken. We sat down and in about 5 minutes our food came out. DELICIOUS!!! Our only complaint was that we aren't 'chopped salad' fans. Funny how I only notice this with my family!!! My brother quickly returned his salad and, almost as quick, got a chicken gyro. DELICIOUS!!! Great prices, fast, great service, great food, and clean!!! What more could ask for??? OPA!"}
{"text":"This was my second time dining in here. The food was still as delicious as the first time. However the service was terrible. This came as a surprise since they were so on point with their customer service the first time around. When we were first seated, our server came up and with out a greeting or introducing himself just asked for our drink order. Came back with our drinks but disappeared for a good 20 minutes before coming back for our food order. No apologies, just came back and asked what we were having.  A runner brought our food out and not once did our server ask if we needed anything or how our food was. It took forever to get our check and the rest of my food boxed up. Mind you, it's a Sunday night at 7:30 and they weren't busy...we we're super disappointed."}
{"text":"OMG! Not only are the food and the service delightful, but the vibe you get when you walk in, seeing Rose (the Matriarch of the family-owned restaurant) attending to the little things, greeting customers, making the utensil bundles in napkins, checking in on happy customers... It's simply wonderful. I have 0% Greek/Mediterranean blood, but the place feels like my Swedish Gramma's kitchen -- full of love, great aromas and happiness. 

I had the Gyro Platter (it was lunch-ish time). It was GENEROUS and delicious. I opted for the Traditional Beef and Lamb combo filling, but there are many choices, including Vegan. The homemade hummus was tangy and delicious. The Basmati rice - perfection. The green salad was all Greek with olives, cucumbers and Feta cheese and you MUST try the Pumpkin-Mushroom Soup -- a cup was just not enough. Next time, I'm getting a full bowl or maybe some to take home. It is comfort in a cup. 

My husband had the Greek Trio, Pastisto, Mousaka and one other item (sorry, I was more focused on tasting my delicious Gyro) and he was very pleased with all of it.

We opted for dessert to be taken out and it didn't disappoint. The Baklava was also generously served and was sweet, sweet, sweet.

Love that we live close to the Market Grill Cafe and we WILL be back & bring visiting relatives/friends to partake in the delightful food."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, ambience was cool outdoors with a bubbling water feature. Vegetables ripe and crisp but the beer prices like a high end restaurant on the strip. Sorry no photos...my Wife and I just got busy.
The entire menu is on my to do list!
Thanks Sheena, Michael, and Kate :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times, multiple locations. Usually pretty good, but definitely not my favorite.  

I had the $7.95 lunch special which included your choice of a lunch entree and a side...my choice was the traditional falafel sandwich with a Greek salad on the side. It was good. The hummus trio looked great, but wasn't as tasty. The best part of the meal was the baklava cheesecake.  

The bill came to $34 for two people for lunch. I know I'll be back, but I don't think I'll be a regular here."}
{"text":"We eat here twice a month.   We always order the lamb and beef gyro platters with the yogurt sauce.  It comes with a Greek salad, hummus and rice.  They give you tons of flavorful meat in the gyros and I can drink the yogurt sauce by itself.  I love their Greek salad, so fresh and the dressing is amazing.  Their rice is fluffy and love the mint they put in it.  The hummus is ok. We always get an extra order of pita bread for $0.50.  Normally my husband and I would order different dishes and share when we order from restaurants but their beef and lamb gyro is so good , we have decided to get our own.  Overall, great value for the amount of quality food that we get.  Also, the staff are really great.  We have eaten at the restaurant before but order to go most of the time."}
{"text":"Great gluten free pasta. We get the baked Ziti every time! Gyros aren't the best there unfortunately. But super nice employees and overall great food."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food, and this is some of the best I've had in Las Vegas.  Prices are reasonable.  I had the lamb kebab.  It came with Basmati rice, a Greek salad, and grilled tomatoes and onions.  I also had rice pudding for dessert.  Wow!"}
{"text":"We have been saying for over a week we were going to try this place. OMG it's our new spot.  We felt a welcoming feeling from the moment we walked in. The service was great and the food mmmm how can I describe it superb!  Since today was our first run we went with the traditional gyro, with their speciality rice and greek salads. We definitely will be back, there's more food for us to try."}
{"text":"David was the perfect host and food server.
Very attentive and friendly but never intrusive.
Please open one in Henderson so we don't have to drive 22 miles to your restaurant."}
{"text":"Yum! We went here for dinner tonight and really enjoyed it! We had the coupon from the internet for 2 free glasses of wine which is always nice!

Let me preface this with I can not spell, so please forgive me if I spell the dishes wrong!

The hummus was good, the pita bread was great and warm, not burned or dry. The consistency of the hummus was smooth, probably thanks to the yogurt it's made with.

I have the spanakopita plate (spinach pie) which I thought was very good. Great balance of phyllo dough, spinach and feta. It was nice to have the plate because it came with rice, a small greek salad (which was good - lots of feta, good salty kalamata olives and nice oil and vinegar dressing) and a taste of hummus (we had gotten an appetizer of the hummus as well...we love hummus).

My hubby had the chicken gyro and really enjoyed it. You can pick was dressing you want on the sandwich, which is nice (tsatziki, hummus or something else).

We also had a side plate of the falafel, which was really good! They were small little falafel balls, but the texture was really nice. Very smooth with a great flavor! 

The service was good and quick, the place was clean and the food was good. We will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"The staff was wonderful! George was very helpful and patient in helping me find the right meal for my little guy. The food was wonderful, pomegranate chicken for little man delicious. I had the gyro platter and it was great!"}
{"text":"I eat there often and the food is always good! This particular time I had the lamb and it was incredible and cooked perfectly! We ALWAYS have to get the pumpkin baklava cheesecake! It is amazing! Attended a large group meeting there and the service was excellent! We stayed at least 1.5 hrs past closing and it was an hour after closing before we even knew they were already closed and that was because we asked! There was no pushing by the staff for us to leave and our server even took photos of our group for us when we were saying our good-byes! Best time I've had as a group at a restaurant! THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"I have been here about three times and not one negative experience.

Despite it's location next to many prefab, commercialized eating establishments, Market Grille Cafe is truly a diamond in the rough
From the time you walk in you immediately notice a nicely decorated place setting the tone that you are about to enjoy yourself.

The next sensation are the smells that begin to prime the taste buds for the wonderful meal that you are about enjoy.

The first few times I was here I pretty much did the Gyro thing and as Gyros go, I was happy.

Tonight, while on a date with my girl, I thought I would branch out and try something different.  I ordered the steak skewers entree which included hummus with pita bread, salad and rice.

My girl ordered the pomegranate salad. An interesting chose I thought.

They staff is so darn friendly and helpful you almost feel transported to another time when this behavior was expected in all restaurants.  They do a great job.

Tonight seemed a bit slow and less noisy than the other times I have been here.  It made for a nice evening of conversation before and after our meal arrived.

Before even taking a bite, I went for a taste of the pomegranate salad.  My first bite told me that this was something special.  Your first hit with pomegranate flavor that explodes in your mouth,  It then begins to disappear and the texture and touches of chicken that did not soak up the marinade follow through.  

I could feel the foodie Barbarian inside me begin to take over but reminded myself that I am a gentleman and proceeded to allow my girl to eat in peace.

My meal was perfectly seasoned and looked incredible.  I started off with the house salad on the plate which was fresh and light with the prefect amount dressing.  The olives and cheese made it only better.

The steak was cooked to a medium well and when they were hot they melted in my mouth.

On must always eat their veggies.  I have a phobia about veggies that I am not going to talk about because I don't need to.  The veggie skewers after their consumption required me to get up an order one more because it was just so good.

Two Plates of great chow with drinks for twenty dollars even.  I found the deal most acceptable.

They also have a punch card program for $10 off your meal.  Don't forget to get one.

The desserts looked awesome but my ever expanding waistline told me that I had better not.

Even as the staff was closing up shop they allowed us to continue our conversation on of all things \"Andre The Giant.\"  They gave no indication of being annoyed with us.  I appreciated that.

They will soon be making a move to a larger venue on Durango & Elk Horn.  I wish them continued success and will gladly drive 30 miles across the valley to eat there again.  This should say something about the experience.

OPA!"}
{"text":"Lunch specials are good; however, has the worst coffee I've ever tasted.  I asked for half & half and all they have is a nasty non-dairy creamer.  How does a Greek place have such terrible coffee & no real cream???"}
{"text":"This place is clean and comfortable.  Good service.  Perfect neighborhood-type place to grab a bite.  I had the cabernet lamb; it was perfectly seasoned and rice in flavor, if a bit overcooked.  The rice was some of the best I've ever had!!  Now, if you're looking for a wide range of good Greek options, this isn't really the place.  But it's not styling itself to be that and it's great at being what it is.  And I'll be back for that rice!!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot close to home and they have great lunch specials. We always get food Togo, we will have to try dining in one day. But the food is always great!!"}
{"text":"This is the place I go for great Greek food my favorite appetizer is the babaganoush. The lamb roast Cabernet is very delicious. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly"}
{"text":"Fabulous Fabulous fabulous 
This place is a Gem.

An   A+++.
Come and see for ur self
Priced great also.
Big portions!"}
{"text":"Best lunch specials in town ! $8.95 includes drink and the food is delicious ! Staff and owner , Joe are very nice and friendly. Healthy options at fast food prices."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas on a business trip for a couple weeks and had to come back multiple times as it is great! Everything I ate was delicious. For appetizers the Saganiki and Baba ganoush were my favorites. For entrees I tried Greek Trio, Gyro and my favorite Pomegranate chicken. Authentic food, wonderful service and 20% off with check in."}
{"text":"One of the good Greek restaurants on the casual side but not too casual. You pay upfront but still served at the table.

- Saganaki: +1 for the entertainment factor
- Filet Tenderloin: Yummy
- Pomegranate Chicken: Unusually sweet but good

The pita was good too. I wish it was near my place..."}
{"text":"BEE'S in your salads! Beware! I found a bee In my entree meal and contacted market grill and they said it was common to find bees in there because they get their materials everyday. I dont want to injest any bug or insects. And hopefully I dont fall Ill to the stinger inside my intestines."}
{"text":"Better than my last few visits, but the flavors are still not what they were when they first opened. The food was well prepared and fresh, I just wish they would kick the spices up!"}
{"text":"I didn't even know about this location til a friend planned holiday meal here for a group- I'm a regular at the Lake Mead location, and was pleasantly surprised by the spacious and more formal interior here. The open grill area where the pita bread is made is a nice touch, too! Unfortunately, the service marred our festive gathering.

The flaming presentation of the Saganaki app set the bar high for food expectations but everything was downhill from there. Menu  is pretty standard- being familiar with their dishes, I know what I like and chose accordingly. The falafel wrap is my usual go-to, and this time I switched it up for the pom chicken and it was flavorful. I sampled friends' orders and the Mama Mia chicken (with goat cheese and balsamic) was tasty, but I did not care for the various pasta dishes, the sauces just did not taste right. Also, most components of the Mediterranean Medley app were off (hummus was bland, babaghanouj had a strange texture, hummus was thin and watery, and dolmas tasted plain).

Most of us enjoyed our food, but man. The service. It seems they are incapable of handling a large (10 person?) group. This was a classic example of why I hate autograt for groups- our server was polite enough when she was around but was less than attentive and repeatedly needed to be flagged down for the basics, like placing orders, correcting orders, address billing issues, etc. The bare minimum was not met. 

We interacted with the manager, who was also initially friendly, but even when he stepped in to help with billing, it was still a disaster: unable to honor a discount (several military in our group), unable to split the bill appropriately, that ridiculous autograt in light of the whole fiasco, several excuses and a bunch of time-wasting, and a general lack of capability. It took literally half an hour to resolve, and it only ended because one friend just put it all on their card and took cash and IOUs from everyone else. Generous, but ridiculous that it was warranted! And it wasn't just us- a third-party food delivery person came in, had an issue, spoke with the manager, and then knocked over a holiday display in anger as he left. I'll stick to the Lake Mead location."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!  After 6 months in Las Vegas, and eating at many restaurants in the area, from local hole-in-the-wall places to the best $$$$ downtown establishments, THIS place, \"Market Grille Cafe\" is our FAVORITE by far!!!

Why?  Well, for starters it has a very nice, relaxed atmosphere.  The inside gives you a definite, casual mediterranean atmosphere.  Gentle, clear white lights, like large Christmas bulbs, are strung across the ceiling.  The decor definitely feeling like a sidewalk cafe in Greece or Italy.  They do have some outside cafe tables as well and overhead misting to keep you cool.

The staff is very friendly, attentive, and helpful.  You realize quickly that this is not only family owned and run, but that they treat you as family too!  They take the time to explain any menu items (since some terms may be Greek to you, LOL!) and also make suggestions based on what's popular, your dietary needs, and of course what their signature dishes are.

Although everything was unique, flavorful, and perfectly prepared, from the appetizers to the desserts, the most amazing, most unique, most original, most flavorful dish is their 

POMEGRANATE CHICKEN IS TO DIE FOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I cannot overstate how incredible this dish is!  Its what has won them awards and its no wonder why.  Even if you're not sure you like pomegranate, YOU'LL LOVE THIS!!!!  Remember how you felt after you first, well, you know?  THAT'S what this is like from the first bite!  OOH! AAH! OMG! YES! YES! YES!!!  Seriously, its that new, that refreshing, that new, that unbelievable, leaving you a bit dazed and confused at first, but soon finding yourself desiring more, more, MORE!!!

Yes, I really do think their Pomegranate Chicken is THAT good!  I even told the artist/creator/chef son that he should go on TV against Bobby Flay.  Pomegranate Chicken would knock Bobby out for certain!

We also liked that the owners came out to chat with their guests, both about the food and as friends/family.  It was easy to forget we were customers.

I could go on and on (obviously, lol), but let me just say once again that this was our BEST DINING & FOOD experience in Las Vegas after 6 months here!  The quality of the food is impeccable, original FAMILY secret recipes, relaxed vacation atmosphere, yet a strong, warm feeling of family, community and togetherness thanks to the owners and staff. 

Well done Market Grille Cafe, well done!  *F*I*V*E* STARS!!!!!"}
{"text":"so I was at their durango location and they were closed. on the quest to find greek. we then checked out our usualy greek spot which was also closed. Being that it is Easter it was no surprise. we then found out that this location was open, thank goodness. We went and was seated immediately and was greated very nicely. We were then told of all the dishes and what was in them and how they were prepeared. I had the greek trio and my lady had the pomegranate chicken. I will admit that the greek trio was good. I could tell that the food had been prepared and was reheated to be served but still had thatgood flavor. my lady's dish was great!! the pomegranate chicken was so tender and was surprisingly sweet, not overpowering but it was done very nicely! we also had the saganaki for an appetizer and it was so good! The seared cheese with the lemon and brandy was awesome. They also have happy hour where the saganaki was for $6!! This place has a very nice atmosphere, friendly and knowledgeable staff, and great food! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Cheese. No, not on the menu. This whole place. But in a good way.

The moment you walk into MGC, you enter a world that seems very similar to \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" or the Mad Greek Cafe in Baker. Lots of Greek decor, and no shortage of Greek music. A great place to be a Greek Geek.

Having said all that, this place is a fun spot to grab a nice, delicious dinner with your pals. You order from a counter, and food is brought to your table.

Lots of items for those with varied palates. Plenty of vegetarian items, white meat, red meat, seafood, etc. 

I recommend the appetizer combo (usually the kiss of death at most restaurants due to fried disgusting nothingness). Pita bread, hummus, tabouli, salad, falafel and dolmades (stuffed grape leaves). Share it with friends. Don't be that guy (or girl).

Service is good, bathrooms are clean. All these things are important. 

This place is worth a second, third or fourth visit. Maybe more. 

I've never tried it, but they are known for their Pomegranate Chicken. I guess this means that I get to go back! Holler.

Just make sure you can tolerate the Greeki-ness of the place. I know I can :)"}
{"text":"BEST, best ever cheesecake!!! If you go there you must leave space in your tummy to order the baklava cheesecake!! So, delicious - not even comparable to the Cheesecake Factory. 
Food was good, nothing spectacular but delicious. The portions are okay at least for the smaller portions. My kids and I had the perfect amount of food with the small portion. Remember, you have to order the baklava cheesecake :)"}
{"text":"Wow.... That about sums it up!! Service was non existent and when it did dribble thru, it was minimal and an excuse. The food was thrown on the plate, actually look like it was dropped on the floor, picked up and thrown back on the plate. I had the lamb and rice, lol sure thats what they called it. String piece of meat over seasoned with an excess amount of garlic and Lemon, basmati rice, tasted like pure lemons. Oh and this \"meal\" cost $12.98. So don't waste your time, money or energy, its terrible ALL round. What a sheer disappointment, well on a positive note, at least I won't make the mistake of returning!! Wish i could give it NO STARS... IT's NOT worth even 1 star"}
{"text":"Good dining room ambiance!

I was joining a friend for lunch on this side of town.  It is a busy area especially during lunch hour.  Finding a parking spot might be a task but one will eventually open. 

The dining room area is decorated lovely.  It's open, clean and inviting.  Service is good.  It was nice to have people coming around to refill my water and clear any plates.  Very nice.  

I ordered their lunch special of choosing two items for 7.50.  There is a check in deal that takes 20% off but you can't use it with the lunch deals. It's still a nice deal.  I chose the traditional gyro with the basmati rice.  The lamb and beef had a great flavor.  Tender and full of flavor.  The rice was light and airy.  It had a great flavor as well.  

It's a nice place and wouldn't mind stopping in again."}
{"text":"They are getting stingy on their portion size. And many of their pastas dont have any sauce anymore. No one wants dry noodles. Ordered the baked ziti and it had barely enough sauce to cover the noodles. Their rice has gone down hill too. Why do I still come here?"}
{"text":"Market Grille Cafe is a great place for any special family event or gathering! The servers there are always so kind and willing to do whatever you would like. The food is always amazing and filled with flavor. The environment is similar to that of a Mediterranean feel, which is the type of food they serve. Prices aren't too high, you will definitely get what you pay for. Plus, it's always nice that the owner, or a member of his family, is always there walking around and talking to people about their meals. You can tell that the family truly cares about their business."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Market Grille.  Always the same order: saganaki and the beef skewer dinner.  Did I mention how much I LOVE this place?! :)  the food is always so fresh and fast & wont break your wallet.  Since moving away from Vegas (tear) this place is always my first stop when I come back for a weekend."}
{"text":"Great food not so noisy that you can't have a good conversation. Prices are not to bad a little less then paymans."}
{"text":"Wish we had one of these back in CT. Truly delicious greek/Med food at great prices.

Souvlaki was excellent - the flaming cheese was good too.  

service was informative and friendly."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 3.5 Stars. Nice atmosphere and a cool outdoor patio (4), but the food was average (2). I had a gyro and the meat was lacking, but the flavor was good. Great customer service (4). Id go back if in the area, but wouldn't make the trip."}
{"text":"The food is just ok. Hummus wasn't super great. The cranberry chicken was very dry and they should have the Lebanese rice since it's a Mediterranean restaurant. Not super impressed. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"This place is consistently tasty, and I don't feel guilty about eating it all the time because most of the dressings and sauces are lower fat.  I think the cutest thing is that there's a cute greek mama who works the cashier.  Everyone who works there seems really friendly, too.  Everything is supposed to be homemade, too.

Items I have tried:
1.  Gyro - tasty, seasoned lamb, chopped romaine, tasty dill/yogurt dressing and warm flat bread
2.  Gyro salad - everything in a gyro, just minus the flat bread and it's vinegarette dressing and feta cheese.
3.  Keftedes - Greek meatballs + some fluffy basmati rice
4.  Pomegranate Chicken Salad - White meat chicken marinated in pomegranate dressing and grilled to perfection, not to dry and juicy enough with a covering of more pom dressing, and all of it placed on a bed of baby spinach leaves. 

p.s.  I ordered a whole Aphrodite Cheesecake (regular cheesecake with baklava bottom) from there, and it was fantastic!  Flaky baklava bottom and fresh cheesecake - can't beat that!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant for many reasons.  The food is always good and consistent.  It is nice for a casual night out.  Service is good.  We prefer the Durango location as we prefer full service.  It tends to be cold so bring a sweater.  The pomegranate chicken that they feature is very good. I always need to ask for additional dressing for the Greek salad which they happily bring. Pricing is very good. Great place for a casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The first time I tried this place, I was looking for greek food.  My husband loves greek food and I had never tried it.  I saw the reviews, it was close to work so I figured let's give it a go!  I ordered the spanakopita entree.  His favorite dish is the \"spinach pie\" so I wanted to surprise him.  I decided to buy us both the entree, which came with the spanakopita, greek salad, basmati rice, and pita bread and hummis.  First, let me tell you...I LOVE IT and I am an extremely picky eater.  The spanakopita was delicious, just the right amount of flavors.  The greek salad had an amazing dressing that didn't over power the salad and brought out all of the natural flavors.  The basmati rice was to die for - the rice literally melted in my mouth and so flavorful.  The hummis was hands down the best hummis I've ever had.  Hummis was the only greek thing I've ever had and only tried store bought.  The hummis here was so yummy.  My husband said this was the best \"spinach pie\" he's ever had.  I talked about this place so much at work that a gal who travels frequently and who is greek stated she never had been there.  Well, she went the next night after I talked it up so much.  Her comment the next day, \"I had the Lamb Gyro and it was the best Gyro I've ever had.\"  Kudos to the Market Grille - you guys have become my favorite food spot in Vegas.  It is a bonus that the place is clean, inviting, and the staff is beyond nice."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we were impressed. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and delicious, reasonably priced food makes for a pleasant dining experience. We'll definitely be back. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"In search of a good Greek place in the northwest and decided to try this chain. Everything on the menu is a bit pricey. The food was okay but I was in search of a more authentic Greek place.  So far the fat Greek off flamingo and decatur is the best around."}
{"text":"came for early dinner around 4pm, on a Thursday. not crowded at all. our server Alexia was helpful, friendly and courteous. the hummus trio appetizer was very good and would for sure order it again. wife had the Greek trio (spanakopita, mousaka & pasitisio) which she really enjoyed. i had the entree Pastitsio. very good. both entrees come with a small salad and rice. food came out quickly and we enjoyed the dining experience. we mentioned that we were tourists and that we love to try locals places, they seem to appreciate that. overall a good experience. it is a drive from the LV strip, but would like to visit again when in LV and try some other food items."}
{"text":"Mediterranean dishes come to life here!

Let's begin with why I come here...the pomegranate chicken! This chicken is so moist and marinated in pomegranate juice and herbs, then topped with pomegranate glaze & walnuts. It's on the sweet side but I love it! My man gets my second favorite dish which is the Mama Mia's chicken and it's grilled olive oil-rosemary chicken topped with fig preserve, goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes and balsamic reduction! Writing this is making me hungry for these dishes right now!

You can pick the perfectly cooked basmati rice or the lemon herb potatoes which are phenomenal. The Greek salads are always fresh and served with a tangy dressing. The soups here are also packed with flavor. I haven't had any that I didn't enjoy. From the avgolemono which is a traditional creamy lemon, chicken & rice soup to the pumpkin or creamy cauliflower ones! All very tasty!

Get 20% off your bill when you check in on Yelp and this is a family owned business that offers very friendly service. We enjoy our visits!"}
{"text":"Went back for  a second time and liked it just as well.  I ordered the trio combo entree which was very good.  If you're not familiar with all the dishes, this one is good to get a sample of pastichio, mousaka and spanakopita (spinach pie).  Friendly staff and nice environment with outdoor seating"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this family-owned restaurant. The service was excellent and the owner came and talked to us after our meal. I got the gyro and my husband got a sampler meal. The gyro was okay as was the sampler. I think the quality was excellent we just aren't fans of traditional Greek food. If you like traditional Greek food then this would be the place for you!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! ! Wrong drink order, wrong food order. Drink refills non existent."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try out a new restaurant and we love Greek food so we tried this place out and was immediately amazed. Very friendly service, clean and I loved the TV monitors that showed you all their food choices. We both ordered the traditional gyros and they were delicious. Fresh ingredients, very flavorful. Their fries were very well seasoned and the hummus was excellent. To top it off the pumpkin cheesecake was to die for. Overall, very happy and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love this spot! It is clean. Servers are having fun which makes we the people have fun too! A little creative Marketing will take this place to the TOP!"}
{"text":"Just had an awful experience with thier take out service after first being put on hold for several minutes half way through the order the girl on the phone starts talking to apparently someone at the counter and hangs the phone up, by accident. Surprisingly enough I waited a minute or two see if she returned the call nope so I called back and completed the order without an apology just a comment of that some times happens, order was to be ready in 15-20 minutes i arrive in the allotted time maybe even 5 minutes late to pickup my order girl at counter finish up with customer in front of me and then I give my name she rings it up accepts payment, then waits on the next person in line, to my shock I sat there for another 20 minutes after everyone before and after me picked up their orders, the girl (who rang me up) looks at me and says have you been helped I said yes I was picking up she ask my name and returns with my order. I ask her how long has it being sitting back there she response it just came up, She opens the boxes to show me the food that is not even warm to the touch. I said this is bull she says I am sorry. I left and checked the food yes it was cold. The long and short any response other than flat out lying would have been acceptable. I used to like this place however if the cannot train the employees to admit when a mistake has been made and offer to rectify the issue then I have spent my last dollar at this place."}
{"text":"We have been here several times. The food is awesome. We always go for the Pomegranate chicken or moussaka. And the pumpkin cheesecake rocks! Also, although it's seasonal, the tiramisu cheesecake is heavenly!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is better than Pashas in San Antonio, which up until now was my standard for Greek food and hospitality.   The traditional gyro platter was plentiful and very tasty.  The saganaki was absolutely mouth watering.  We're coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent and fresh food. I love their hummus, salads, soups and saganaki."}
{"text":"Yelp scores again!  Started with cheese melted into a golden crust, served with a flaming brandy sauce and pita bread for dipping.  Then pomegranate chicken with a sweet walnut glaze--rivaling the most succulent steak!  The owners have truly imported part of Greece to Las Vegas.  Get a 360 view of the decor, floor to ceiling.  Ask your server for recommendations; you'll appreciate it even more.  I left a 100% tip.  Stellar service."}
{"text":"I love their food. Plato's potatoes are fantastic. Also love the falafel wrap with spinach tortilla."}
{"text":"We love their Gyro so much that we go there every other week for a sandwich. The staff was courteous and the place is clean as can be so if you like Greek food stop by the market c we love their Gyro so much that we go there every other week for a sandwich. The staff was courteous and the place is clean as can be so if you like Greek food stop by the market Grille Cafe."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident, we were looking for food that is natural and don't serve with MSG. We were first greeted by this lady that looks like any body's aunties she's  very pleasant. The food was very fresh, natural simple clean taste. We order the gyros  chicken pomegranate it's  has a deep flavor and Greek salad. The best lunch for quick, satisfying and delicious. We were then visited by the owner Joe who is italian and his wife is greek who happen to originate from Icaria one of the island of Greece and she brought that cooking style in restaurants. They even have like a open cooking area to show the freshness. Did some Google search we found out people live there very long average mortality age is 90 years old, it says people forget to die Lol, eating the same diet or cooking. I love this place, definitely will go back, we're gonna try the one close to our home too."}
{"text":"We have been searching for a really great Mediterranean restaurant.  Finally, we found one!  The service was great, the prices were good, and the food was EXCELLENT!!  We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place had an off day today. Have had plenty of good meals here and one of my favorite dishes is the Pomegrante Chicken. I had to depart the place this time without eating cause the previously mentioned chicken was nearly ice cold. I opted for the refund because the chicken also seemed a tad soft. There was only one cook, but it was just after the lunch rush - still unusual and no OPA's. Hope they get back on track."}
{"text":"The dolmades are to die for!!!

The best thing about this place, though, is how extremely accommodating to your dietary requirements.  They even have a sign up saying to tell them if you're vegan or vegetarian, and they'll accommodate!  As a vegan it's nice to not have to list off the ingredients I need to be warned of, or get an allergen information sheet to read through... I just say \"vegan dolmades please!\" and get a delicious fresh order of dolmades without the non-vegan sauce.

Their carryout is incredibly convenient - there's a secondary door for only carryout, that opens into a room with a counter to order at, and waiting room for you to sit while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"Love the \"family environment\" feeling here. Both locations are family owned and operated. Both offer great service. I'm sure not everyone that works there is not related, but you wouldn't know it because they are so friendly and treat you like family. The food is fresh and flavorful. Pomegranate chicken it's probably their most popular dish. A definite winner! Lemon soup is also really good. The only one criticism I have is that they used canned peaches on the grilled skewers. Would be better if they used fresh peaches. Great spot for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Greek food that will male your mouth water. This place is a jewel, beautifully decorated the servers are warm and friendly. They will explain the menu and some favorite choices if its your first time. I kept it somple and had a wrap. I wish i had talen a picture of it. But i just couldnt put it down. 
Plus is a family owned and operated. 

At the end of our meal the manager came over and thanked us for trying them out and made sure we have a good visit. Talk about a great first impression."}
{"text":"My husband and I take visiting guests here as it's close to our house. I don't think we've ever had anything bad here. The sampler platter is good, and the gyros are delicious too. My favorite item is the spanikopita; I get this frequently at Greek restaurants, and this is one of the best renditions of it that I have tasted."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch for pick up for my wife and I, I arrived with a 20 percent of final bill coupon \"from yelp\" where I was told I could not use it for lunch!!! I ordered the lunch combo witch apparently does not come with a beverage and I asked for an extra side of sauce and the lady rolled her eyes and said there will be another charge. The service at the till was shocking just didn't care Nd didn't want to be there.. I know we all have our bad day but I'm a paying customer try and crack a smile!!!"}
{"text":"Great fresh Greek food. A little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for. 

The pomegranate chicken is great. Sweet and tangy, a very moist chicken breast.  Their traditional lamb and beef gyro is tasty. No surprises just simple and delicious. If you like soup get the avgolemono soup, it is creamy and refreshing, the combination of lemon, chicken, and rice is perfect. The baklava cheesecake is very decadent, a layer of cheesecake with a baklava crust, the best of both worlds. The only reason I'm not giving a five star is because of the to go wait time being a little too long sometimes."}
{"text":"I love finding new spots on Yelp! After spending most of my day at the DMV, I found myself starving! I am so glad I found this charming family owned restaurant . They're lunch specials are great and they turned out the food so fast! I had the traditional Gyro with their lemon chicken soup  so good ! Try the Greek French fries they are amazing!! Definetly bringing friends here !"}
{"text":"Opa!

Best gyro I ever had. My wife's pomegranate chicken was excellent.  We bought Aphrodite's cheesecake and baklava to bring home, and they were also excellent with the noticeable taste of cinnamon, the baklava more cinnamony than honey-flavored.   The wait staff is well-trained and highly motivated.  

The young woman who served our table was beautiful with a highly cute personality.  You would attack Troy for her.  She was much better on the eyes than was Aphrodite's cheesecake.  

Oh, and they've won the Best of Las Vegas poll three years running.

10% military discount and I very much appreciate that."}
{"text":"I have been coming here once a week for over a year with my dear friend for our girls night out dinner! I order the same glass of white wine every time, the White Haven! This time my wine was warm. I asked the server if I could have another glass of the wine cold. The owner came over to inform me that the wine is correct temperature with a snotty tone and she suggested I have ice cubes with my wine. Since I received my warm wine which my friends also confirmed was warm they have been checking the wine fridge. The wine is warm and I thought the customer was always right, even if she disagrees with me about the wine temp she should at least be kind. I am disappointed in the owner!"}
{"text":"Well, I like Mediterranean food a lot! I just was not impressed. The hummus wasn't anything special. The gyro was only so, so...they have a baklava crust cheesecake... Not impressed at all... I was disappointed... I really wanted to like it. So I ordered the baklava seperate... Still just not very good. The falafel not good either. But, then again I'm just not a fan of falafel in the first place. 
 The really good thing here is the spanikopita! Yum! Add a little tzatsiki and yeah...it is worth coming here for that again!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience with the take out staff and kitchen staff last night.  This was the third time they got my gyro platter wrong in the last two months. After they claimed to correct the order, it was still completely wrong.  We spoke to owner/manager Joe later in the evening, not sure if anything can be corrected.  Staff think that customers don't know Greek food although many of us the customers are either Greek or from Mediterranean countries. Ordered the following:

1) Ordered plain Gyro with nothing on it.  Came as a Pita sandwich with thick combination of  inside the bread.  Sent it back, and it still came back 15 minutes later same way.  I don't believe they fixed the problem.  When the take out person went back to the kitchen to ask kitchen staff to fix it, I heard laughter from the kitchen. I guess it is pretty funny when you don't do your job right !

2) Ordered pita bread 'plain'.  It came with 'rosemary'.  Some people are allergic to rosemary.  Our order was very clear. 

3) Ordered salads with no onions in them.  They looked like they added extra onions to salads !

This whole ordeal took 1 hour !   for take out.  Is this a joke ?  When we brought the food home, it was cold.  and home is around the corner.

As frequent customers (twice a week) and occasional catering since the day they opened, this was the worst we have seen.  

Also the smart ass waiter asked for my ID for the $45 dollar order and questioned that I had a moustache in my ID photo and I don't have a moustache in person.

Are you guys trying to LOSE customers ?"}
{"text":"Was craving gyros along with falafel and since we just moved into the neighborhood this place seemed good and boy was it. Their food was fresh and and service was amazing I can't wait to go back to get more gyros and falafel."}
{"text":"Yeah I would say this is one of the hidden gems in the Valley.  I go to th one in Centennial Hills, and know they just opened one at 95 and Lake Mead. The food is made to order, excellent quality, and very reasonably priced. There are always coupons in the local newspapers and entertainment books that make it an even better deal. The workers are all really friendly and nice.  I've had the beef/lamb gyro wrap, the chicken with potatoes entree, and keftedes (greek meatballs) entree, all of them get an \"A\".  The cheesecake is very good, also gets and \"A\".  Don't listen to Carly A, she is high. There's no way this place gets 2 stars."}
{"text":"My wife, grandma and I went here for the first time last night. The setting is nice and clean. The staff was also very helpful and responsive. As for the menu, they have a mix of Italian and Greek. We started with the hummus trio, all of which were awesome! They even brought us extra pita bread at no cost. As my main course, I got the traditional gyro and it was pretty good. It was slightly saltier than I like my food, but tasty overall. My wife got the filafel gyro and she really like it, but it was a little spicy for her. Grandma got the baked ziti and liked that, too. I'd definitely come to this place again."}
{"text":"Was headed to panera bread and noticed this place in the same small mall area. Great service and awesome food. The pitas, hummus, chicken gyro and appetizer plate were incredible. Everything was fresh and delicious! . Will eat here each time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We love this place...great service...great staff and wonderful food.  We discovered this place about 4 months ago and eat here regularely,,,,,,love the soups they have and the souvflaki:)"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since the food is delicious. However, for the third time in three weeks the service was not up to par. There are not too many other places I would tend to frequent that have bad service and good food, so I guess this is a testament to how good the food is at Market Grille. However, they have a few silly policies like not letting you use your $10 coupon towards the full bill on a lunch special; you still have to leave the tax which is annoying. Also they only now allow one discount to be used. Those things are small in comparison to how slow the service is - after being seated we actually had to ask for a server to come to our table and then it took awhile to get food. The other two times we got takeout, they messed up our order, forgot to give us our drinks (which we had to inconveniently drive back for), and took absolutely no credit for their mistakes. They also smirked when I asked for fries as the side. I don't know what's happening, but this place is going downhill fast!"}
{"text":"You MUST try the Pomegranate chicken!! It is spectacular! All of their food is delicious, I just wish the serving sizes were bigger for the price you pay on the lunch menu!"}
{"text":"I really like the freshness of Market Grill and how it's all homemade.  We really can't say that much here in Las Vegas!  

What I always get:

Dolmades- dip them in the hummus that comes along side-HEAVENLY!

Falafel with Satziki on pita bread with a spike of hummus or babaganoush-true love :)  The babaganoush is terrificly garlicky-soo addictive, don't plan on kissing anyone for a while!

My total bill comes to around $30, but I make it last through about 3-4 lunches!
 
If you are a fan of Greek, try it-you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Meh, choke, sodium, sodium, sodium. Maybe it's because I make Armenian food similar to how we taught the Greeks way back when (to any Greek's reading this, I love you, but you know it's true) so I'm a bit more critical than most. The dinner salad not so good. The Sarma, aka dolmadas/stuffed grape leaves, really salty. The gyros - what kind of tasteless, funky meat is that? Cat? Anyway, the BEST WAIT STAFF EVER still can't overcome the food issues. The avgolemono soup was absolutely delicious one day and then salty the next. Obviously, one of the cooks love salt. Lots and lots of salt. I'm getting thirsty just writing this. A sea of salt. I will go back and ask for no salt."}
{"text":"Once in a while I find a place with great food, service, and atmosphere: this is one of those times.  The food is freshly crafted and delicious.  All I can say is that I will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"This establishment took the property in the Lake Mead Plaza that used to be Pei Wei.  They kept the skeleton of the previous restaurant and almost like waving a magic wand, made everything that was formerly Asian... the menu, decor, font... and made it Greek.  

Friendly staff.  Clean Bathrooms.  Good food.  Reasonable prices.  The owner is friendly and approachable.

The format: Head in, choose off the menu, order, get your number, grab your drink, display the number, and your food arrives shortly.  

Make sure you give them a heads up if you'd like your appetizer prior to your main entree as it sometimes arrives all at once.

When I visit, I usually drop in and have a Gyro around lunchtime... traditional, with hummus served on it.  Veggies are fresh, the meat slices are nice and hot.  For dinner I enjoy the Greek Trio Platter.  I enjoy the Greek dinner dishes with pasta and the like but sometimes it can be a lot of one flavor.  The Greek Trio platter is a sample of three of their main dishes with a bit of salad.  I also recommend the pomegranate chicken salad, my roommate's favorite on the menu.

The saganaki is pretty good, too.  It's not the best I've had, but it's not drowning in oil or greasy.  Love to eat it drenched on pitas.

The stuffed grape leaves and the pumpkin soup are also notable as delicious appetizers that I consistently enjoy.

I'm honestly not a huge fan of their hummus.  I think it could do with a pinch more flavoring and it's a little too smooth for me.  It works well as a complimentary taste on the pita but solo, not so much.

I recognize a few of the songs that they play in the background from My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  See if you notice which ones!  :)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times with my teenager. We LOVE IT! Whether your a vegetarian or not, if u want a drink or not, it's all here. I will for surely be back and try something new each time until I've tasted it all. Plenty of room for groups and cozy for an intimate meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely delish!  First time having Greek food.  LOVED IT!   Great prices - we did the 2 for $30.  1 appetizer/2 main dishes/dessert/soda.  Can't go wrong.  Perfect size portions.  Super friendly staff - you feel like you are with family.  Our server knew all the dishes and ingredients - very impressive.  Joe, the owner, comes and greets you - super nice guy.  Can't wait to go back and try more dishes. 5 STARS!"}
{"text":"Love eating at this restaurant. A little pricey but quality is good. I can not vouch to say this is truly authentic geek but it tastes great!  Their gyros are delicious and the pomegranate chicken is great. They have an aphrodite cheesecake that is bomb. We've come and had a private event in their banquet room and service could have been better but it wasn't horrible. I recommend getting breath mints after eating here though!"}
{"text":"We had a very special group of Midwives, Doula's and Lactation Consultants who came together to welcome one of our own to Las Vegas, Barbara Harper, the founder of Waterbirth International. It was a very special dinner, and we are all so glad we chose MGC for our event. Not only was the food delicious, and the service stellar (Thank you Robert!!!), but we were there chatting and enjoying the conversation well past closing, and not even once did we feel rushed or pushed to leave. We chose the 7070 N. Durango location for our gathering. We had a fantastic and relaxing time and so enjoyed catching up and breaking bread together. Thank you Market Grille Cafe! OPA!"}
{"text":"Market grille made me fall in love again with Mediterranean/Greek food. Very nice restaurant clean and great environment super friendly staff and the food is always on point with very generous portions. I like to pick the classic gyro but de lemon chicken soup they have is honestly to die for!"}
{"text":"The food and service were both very good. Nice variety of meals to choose from. We went back twice and liked it both times."}
{"text":"Since the first time my husband and I stepped foot inside this restaurant, we fell in love! Their gyro  pizza was amazing! So were their fries and pomegranate chicken meal, I always order the same thing when we go in, their cannoli's weren't all that great, the filling was just blah! Food tastes much better when the restaurant isn't packed, maybe because they're in a rush, on the plus side, if you're a LVAC member, you get a discount when you show them your card, if you're ever in the neighborhood, give them a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I was not planning on going here today. My family wanted to go to Panerra, but there was a line out the door, so I suggested we walk next door and check out Market Grill Cafe. I am so glad we did.

I've always been a fan of Greek food. This place is as good as any other place in town. I had the traditional gyro while the wife had a chicken gyro and the kid had a chicken kabob. All of them were outstanding. Combine that with good service and this is great place to go."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is delicious and their service is fast.  I have eaten inside and done the take out and am pleased with both."}
{"text":"If you want great authentic Greek food you need to check out Market Grill Cafe. The staff are friendly and courtesy and always there to explain the menu. If you like a tradidonal gryo you need to try there's and don't forget to try the pumpkin cheese cake it is the best in town. 
Good eating!"}
{"text":"Really loved this place. You walk in and know the food is good. The food was so fresh and tasty. The staff was super friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Their spinach hummus and Greek meatballs were awesome! I wish there were more rice though."}
{"text":"Ordered some food tonight for pick up and was not impressed. I decided to call my order in so it would be ready when i got there. Although the guy who took my order was nice, I had to repeat my order twice and had to correct him when he read it back to me and was missing an item. Of course when I got there it was still wrong. I ordered 3 gyro sandwiches, 1 gyro platter, large order of platos potatoes (seasoned fries)  and some cheesecake. I received only 3 gyros so I was missing one. This was what I kept telling the guy over the phone that I wanted 3 gyros PLUS the platter but he still didn't get it. Oh well he didn't charge me for it and I didn't want to wait longer for them to make it so I just left with what I had.

The gyro was gross the meat was cold, very dry and flavorless. We asked for the cucumber sauce on the side and it came in 1oz cups. Same with the hummus that comes w/ the platter and the sauce that comes with the large order of fries. Reallly 1oz??? It makes me angry to pay 8.00 for a sandwich and get a little cup of sauce. Gyro time is way better for gyros if that's what your looking for do not waste your time here! I did enjoy the aphrodite cheesecake which is why the 1 star but everything else from the food to the service was crappy."}
{"text":"THEY HAVE GLUTEN FREE OPTIONS!

When in town we have been to Market Grille Cafe with my sister and her family and always enjoy ourselves. 

The staff is friendly, the food is great, the prices are reasonable, the portions are good, and it's easy to park.

Today my mom and I got take out because of a horrible experience we had at 2 restaurants before we remembered Market Grille Cafe had Gluten Free options. Jessica helped us today in the take out area and we can't thank her enough for being so kind and expediting our order because we were SO HUNGRY! 

If we have to have a family dinner out again, Market Grille Cafe is definitely our family dining preferred choice."}
{"text":"This place is the cleanest place in town. Family ran and ran the best! The array of items to chose from make it my local favorite! Rose is always there to greet you with a beautiful Italian smile. The roots are so deep here as if you are a part of the family."}
{"text":"Never again...I understand we were a large group and they had a big catering order but we waited over an hour for our food. I waited over an hour for what they call a nonna pizza (a pita bread slapped with cheese and mushrooms) and it was $9. We could have gone to in n out and had a better meal and would not have waited more than HOUR. This was our first time here and we will definitely not be back or do we recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. This is a great lunch and dinner restaurant. The Platos Potatoes are addictive. The leftovers, if anything makes it, are great the next day."}
{"text":"I still love this place, don't get me wrong. But I am taking a star away from my last review because it weirded me out that I couldn't get a to-go cup for my soda last time I was here. Seriously? I paid over 30 bucks for a meal for 2 people and I can't get a plastic cup? Maybe I am cheap...maybe I didn't need the soda...but dude. Please give me a to-go cup. I would've even paid the 10 cents it is worth. 
Oh well. 
The food is amazing so I will go back and be sure to drink my entire drink before I want to leave."}
{"text":"LOVE! Always fresh, always delicious 
Thanks for turning my night around! Always courteous and efficient staff!"}
{"text":"Wow. Stumbled here by accident and what luck!!  Absolutely delicious and authentic. Fantastic price on the lunch special. Highly recommend over the traditional. Oh and friendly service too. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Good local food. The people are pretty cool and you get the whole family owned vibe. The quality has really always been at least an 8 out of 10.. 
The spinach basil hummus is off the chain.. The only thing I could say to encourage owners is the odd way that they hand deliver sweetener/ sugar.. Its not like its not on the table and they bring you a container for self serve, but literally bring you a varied amount.. Its a distraction to the dining and the servers running sweetener probably nullifies the savings of not having it on the table.. Overall cool place to go."}
{"text":"The service is very good, friendly and pleasant enjoyed hummus on warm fresh pita bread with pomegrante chicken spinach salad. It was fresh, delicious and reasonably priced with a pleasant clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"So met a friend here for dinner last week; had been here at this location several times and I always mean to write a review and this time I remembered! Really good Greek food; had the traditional gyro entree and it was tasty."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular. I've recommended many friends and family members as well. My husband and I always got the sampler platter with our entrees. We always substitute the grape leaves and falafel (we don't care for them) with a little more Greek salad (that it already comes with) and fries. 

It's never been an issue. Until today! The manager was SO rude to me. He argued with me, explained it was too costly to substitute. He talked over me, raised his voice, and completely made me never want to return here ever again. Apparently us taking some more Lettuce and fries instead of falafel and grape leaves is too expensive for them and this is more important than customer service. We will not return. The level of unprofessionalism is unacceptable and that man should be fired."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to love this place. A) I love Greek food, B), I am a big supporter of family run businesses and C) we have 2 locations very close to our house.

But I was slightly disappointed.  The prices seem high, the service seems unfocused and overall, the food was just ok.  Nothing fantastic unfortunately.

And one thing that I thought was highly weird is that the drink station is out in the open, like a fast food place.  I had waited for 5-8 minutes for our server to notice that my iced tea was nearing empty and ask if I needed a refill, but nothing.  So, I proceeded to get up myself and walk the 10 feet to the drink station directly across from our table to refill my drink and I was blocked by 2 different servers, who directed me to go sit back down and they would call my server over.  They were nice and friendly about it, but it was just weird to me."}
{"text":"A usual \"go to \"for a \"to go\" order! Such a great alternative if you eat later at night (like me) and aren't a fan of fast food all the time... 

I order take out here quit often. The staff is very friendly and attentive in making sure you receive the correct order. The owners seem to be pretty involved which is quite nice! 

The salads and appetizers are amazing. The Dolmades & Greek salad is what I usually get and it's always so fresh, even the next day! My boyfriend usually gets their Mamma Mia Chicken which is excellent & comes with hummus + pita bread & a Greek salad. Cheap price for delicious noms. 

Time frame for orders is very quick as well. I usually call in my order and by the time I drive from my house to the restaurant (10-15 minutes) my order is ready to go! 

Double thumbs up for this place!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Solid Greek menu with a nice cafe setting. Friendly staff and tasty tasty goodness, you should check it out for lunch or a decent dinner if you are in the area.  Definitely filling!"}
{"text":"If your in the mood for Greek food this is the spot. The family decided to try this place. There was no wait and we got a great spot for my dad to watch the game. 
The service was wonderful!! The  wait staff was friendly and attentive. We had the hummus trio with pita bread and it was delicious. Also I had the pomegranate chicken and I was surprise how the flavors went so well together. I didn't really like the rice because the grains were so small that it spilled everywhere. We also had the trio and gyro entrees that were good as well. Everyone had a good time and left full."}
{"text":"This place was DEE_LICIOUS!
The wait staff was very attentive, with the owner coming over several times to check in on us. We had the fried cheese with brandy and split a mediterannean plate and finished up with the pumpkin baklava. Trust me...we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Love Mediterranean food especially when it's fresh like it is here.  Great place for lunch. I ordered the pumpkin mushroom soup. Thought it was an interesting combo it was very good. Though there was construction going on in the front of the restaurant, the owner was kind enough to approach each table and apologize for the inconvenience  and noise.  Would definitely go back again. Hope they open one in the southwest"}
{"text":"Hooray for having Greek food in NW Las Vegas! Market Grille is tasty, and I love that we can do take-out. My husband loves their gyros and basmati rice; I love the spanakopita and their Greek salad is wonderful. The dressing is a pregnancy craving! 

I was not impressed with the pomegranate chicken; it tasted over-marinated, and almost mealy texture-- while many may rave about it, I don;t think I would order it again. 

Do, however, order the traditional baklava or the Aphrodite cheesecake, and you won;t be disappointed!"}
{"text":"i really enjoyed my first visit here and was impressed with the gent behind the counter (I think he is one of the owners?).  He was quick to offer us a gluten-free/vegan/veggie menu, as I said I couldn't ingest dairy.  During our meal, he came by and asked if we were happy with everything (we were).  I ended up ordering the lentil soup and the Plato's Potatoes (i.e., fries topped with a secret spice blend).  The soup was delicious, but the fries were so-so (I thought the accompanying yogurt dip was too yogurt-y and the fries on their own were surprisingly bland).  I also ordered a few of the butter cookies, which proved to be a good decision.  Lovely, shortbread-like cookies dusted with confectioner's sugar.

The place is clean and bright and is great for a casual meal with friends.  You make your order at the counter, pay, take a number, find a seat, then wait for your meal to be brought to you.  It's like a very upscale cafeteria!

I'm happy that there is a unique place like MGC in the north part of town."}
{"text":"I am no Greek food extraordinaire but I like to think my taste buds work pretty well.  Excuse me for not remembering the name of the dish but I got the appetizer with the cheese that they light on fire.  I've had it about 6 times in my life before and it always ends up spreadable and delish.   This time it didn't have great flavor and it hardened up way to fast.  I'd take a pass on this item if I had a do-over.   The falafel's didn't hit the spot.  But I've only had it once before so I'm not sure what good falafel even tastes like... so it gets a pass.  

The most major downer was the lamb and beef gyro.   It was bland and didn't have that rich tasty flavor I need in my gyro.  The meat wasn't doing it for me.  I kinda wanted to throw it across the room in sadness.   

But the service was very quality.  Our server was Athena and she was solid.  I asked for the feta and cheese on the side but when the gyro came out, it was on it.  She kept my soda full enough to look past it.   

Clean place with a nice feel to it.  But food just didn't hit the mark for me."}
{"text":"for reasons unbeknownst to even myself, we hadn't eaten at market grille for months.
we used to eat here at least once a month.

we popped in here the other day because we realized it had been awhile since we visited joe and the family.
the food was, as per usual, delicious.
but, for whatever reason, the portions were HUGE!
neither one of us could finish our food.
can you say 'leftovers!\"
sweet!

joe wasn't there but we spoke with rhonda and she told us about their new location opening on november 8 in the montecito marketplace on north durango.
yay!!!
i am so excited!!!

so happy for them.
they've taken their family recipes and turned them into a successful business serving up some of the freshest food in town.

psst.....you should have a food truck.
=o)"}
{"text":"Congrats to joe and the family on their newest location!!!

Just another great family owned and run business. 
Fresh, fast, homestyle Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I've been to Greece...I ate as much as I could! It was so memorable that I've been trying to find something that would fill the void of missing the food in Greece. 

I was able to try their moussaka today. The eggplant tasted fresh, potatoes were tender and the beef was seasoned just right. Although nothing really comes close to the food in Greece, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. It tasted fresh rather then cooked, freezed and thawed when ordered. Greek salad came on the side which was fresh as well.  Along with my entree also came pita and hummus. The hummus was quite tasty. Mmmmm...

Before leaving...I tried the Aphrodite's Cheesecake as I read it won a few food awards. It had a baklava bottom crust. Delicious! The cheesecake itself was rich and creamy. The baklava on the bottom was yummy, but not crisp due to the cheese cake sitting on top.

Overall...it was worth the try and I will be back to try more things on their menu."}
{"text":"My dad has been dying to try this place out for a few months. He peeked inside before and thought it looked really cute. It is! The inside is decorated with a nice warm inviting feel. The tables have beautiful large photos of the Greek coastline, and I love the grill in the center of the room.

The menu has your standard Greek fare. Most items can be ordered a la carte, which comes with just rice, or as an entree, which then comes with rice, salad, hummus, and pita. If you have a smaller (ie, normal) sized appetite, the a la carte will be just fine. Dad and his gf enjoyed the lamb kabob and mousaka, and bf and I shared a gyro wrap and a lamb gyro. Wish the gyros had a bit more tzatziki but the flavor was good and the meats very tender.

Service was quick and friendly. It was a packed house on a Sat night and we got our food really fast.

The patio looks really cute too but it was close to 20 degrees tonight, so maybe next time!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in northwest Vegas!!! I love it.  My favorite is the traditional gyro with the lentil soup!  I also would probably donate a limb for their baclava!  It is the best I have ever eaten!! My favorite apps are the flaming cheese (saganaki) and the humus is also great. I come here ALL THE TIME!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this family owned traditional Greek restaurant!  Service is friendly and fast.  Try the pomegranate chicken or the spanakopita!  Both are delicious."}
{"text":"This is not a sit down and order restaurant so I wouldn't go here again as a date. I thought it was a bit expensive for the ambience, though by checking in on Yelp we received 20% off of our bill. The traditional gyro was good, as were the Platos Potatoes, but the dolmas were not very good. I probably wouldn't eat here again but it's worth a try!"}
{"text":"After realizing early on that the Lake Mead location was no good, we started to frequent the Durango Market Grille Cafe. 

Over the past few months (maybe longer) service and quality have gone downhill. Our to-go orders are generally incorrect, greens are wilted and discolored, and items that once tasted great and fresh are now bland or overly salted. 

Time to find a new Greek place, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Came for an early dinner on a Saturday night at 5 pm. Made a reservation but it wasn't necessary by any means. Sat outside on the patio as it was a beautiful day. I had my 4 month old and we had plenty of space to start. Sever was nice and informative about specials and drinks. We ordered a pitcher of sangria and saganaki to start. The saganaki was the best part of our experience. The saganaki is a piece of cheese sitting in olive oil, lemon, and brandy that is lit on fire table side. It was served with warm pita bread. Delicious. We ordered three entrees to share (we often just pass plates to try a little of every thing). The Greek trio was odd and underwhelming. Think shepherds pie, baked ziti, and spinach with filo dough. Eh. The pomegranate chicken was highly recommended and was the dish the waitress said was an award winner. Didn't win any awards in our book. Was VERY sweet...but at the same time not flavorful? Lastly, the vasilios platter was basically a deconstructed gyro. Again, not a lot of flavor and a bit underwhelming. The sataziki and hummus were perfectly acceptable. Our peaceful evening turned a bit sour when a family of 8 arrived with their 70 pound dog. He jumped on another guest not a part of their party and tired multiple times to get over to us and our food. Waitresses frequently were seen petting and interacting with the dog, which left a sour taste in my mouth. Got dessert to go. The aphrodites cheesecake was again supposed to be another award winner per our waitress. We took about three bites before we threw it away. The worlds best dessert, aka the chocolate baklava, was terrible. Something was terribly burnt and bitter. We will not return for dinner, but will probably return for sangria and appetizers (that cheese is amazing)."}
{"text":"Good food, awesome happy hour, didn't expect them to have greek beer(?) but it was awesome, and I believe 1/2 price drinks."}
{"text":"I love the food and the food is good and I got the Greek salad and pomegranate chicken i think this is my favorite food !"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. The service is pretty friendly, but extremely slow. I did wait 1 hour for one plate of food when it wasn't even busy so that was pretty crappy. But it was good food. The restaurant itself, aesthetically, is also nice. A bit dark for my taste though (I do happen to prefer restaurants with more natural light, keeps the mood more alive and happy)   
All in all I give it a 4."}
{"text":"I'm actually middle eastern and this place lives up to my standards lol. Their lintil soup is delicious along with the other long list of things that I've tried here... ooh if they still have it definitely get their pumpkin cheescake baklava (i posted a pic), it is to DIE FOR!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back to this place. Great Food, Decent prices,  Vibrant Atmosphere.
For some reason I can't get the hang of the ordering system though. They have so many menu items that I want to sit down at a table and look over the menu, but you have to order up at the front and then sit down. Similar to panera bread or Jasons Deli. But this place feels like more of a restaurant. and I wanna peruse a menu Darn it!

However The food is really good so I can put my own weird preferences aside. 

I've had their moussaka, seasoned fries, hummus plate and creamy cilantro soup and Ive loved all of it. I can't wait to go back and try more dishes. 

The atmosphere is great, the colors and music, and light, the open style kitchen so you can see the cooks at work. Its awesome.   The best part is leaving a tip, everyone has to yell OPA!"}
{"text":"Consistently great. Nothing is bad here, and everything is above average or great. Value is fair. Based on the setup (cashier, pay first like Parsley) you could get a fleeting second of sticker shock - not expensive , just different vibe - but I have never left there not happy that I did, and know I will be back. Filet kabob meal/platter. Is my go to."}
{"text":"An update has been a long time coming. Market Grille was one of the first locally owned restaurants we tried when we relocated to Las Vegas in 2011 and we have been coming back several times a month (sometimes 1-2 times a week) since then. 

While many things have changed in Las Vegas, Market Grille remains consistent--in all the right ways. Whether we are picking up take out after a long day, or want to bring out of towners for a relaxed patio dinner on a nice summer evening, we know that everyone will leave full and happy.

My mom is gluten free, I have several vegetarian friends, the menu accommodates almost everyone's needs. My favorites are the lemon chicken soup, the pomegranate chicken, and the stuffed tomatoes. The baklava is also amazing, and the pumpkin cheesecake if you are feeling particularly indulgent. 


Market Grille has gone out of their way for me on several occasions - giving me a laminated copy of their nutritional information (before the menu changed a little - not sure if these are still available) to even pureeing lentil soup for me when I had suffered a dental emergency. 


Both dining room and take out service and food are consistent - I've never gotten food home with any problems, or anything slimy and cold. Truly a neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Had the mousaka here and it was delicious! The portion size was great and a good price. Their ingredients seemed fresh. It is a small place but nice open seating. Self Serve Drinks.

The menu at the counter where you order is actually on the ceiling so it wasn't easy to read.

I've also tried the appetizer sampler and the pomegranate chicken at a different location (Lake Mead) and that was great. Good for sharing. Oh also had their salad (part of entree combo) and I Loved it!

Good pricing, good portion, and great service. (order at the counter and it gets brought to  your table)

I've been craving their hummus and pita and mousaka for a while, I need to go back! But too many options for food during the holidays."}
{"text":"Family owned restaurant. Very friendly staff, quiet, yet many people were dining. i had the gyro plate with rice. It was very good. My father in law had spaghetti which he said was very good as well. Wine and beer are available. Booths and tables are available. Sauces are made from scratch as is the humice. There are non Greek dishes on the menu, good selection of desserts. 

We will definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"Market Grille is my absolute favorite restaurant.  While we were living in Las Vegas, we were eating there or getting takeout from there 2 or 3 times a week.  It's that good!  Everything is so fresh and flavorful.  My favorite is the chicken gyro with their delicious dill yogurt sauce, and a lentil soup.  Really though, everything on the menu is wonderful.  The spinach basil hummus and also the spanokopita are also favorites of mine.  The staff is friendly and welcoming, too."}
{"text":"My favorite Greek spot in town. I've never had a item that disappointed. My wife and I go at least once a month. Great lunch specials as well. Staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"I got the chicken skewers and the chicken was so delicious! So flavorful and juicy! I loved it!"}
{"text":"Very good Greek food. Their soup is delicious. My favorite is the Spanakopita entree. Have not tried anything I did not like."}
{"text":"Located in Summerlin/North Las Vegas area, I only go when I'm working and for lunch. It's a pretty popular lunch place from what I've seen and they offer a nice lunch menu. My friend and I go and usually split something off that and get the hummus appetizer to go with it. 

I came her for lunch on my birthday a couple months back and the owner happened to be there. She is awesome and so kind. She gave us discount cards for the first timers in the group to come again. She also gave me a slice of their Athena cheesecake. It is cheesecake with a baklava crust. It was good but not my favorite. I am very picky with cheesecake though because my own father makes a killer one from scratch. The baklava crust was lost on me and the others trying it. It just tasted like filo dough and was a bit tough. I'll take my cheesecake and baklava separate and possibly still at the same time. 

The hummus is good, great texture and comes in a few different flavors. You can get one or an order of three. We usually just go with the one because it's two of us, but it's plenty. The Greek salad is made with fresh ingredients and is solid, but nothing stands out. They have a pomegranate chicken that is pretty delicious and worth getting if you like that or want to try something new. 

The staff are always very friendly and efficient. They are clearing plates immediately and serving your food to the table as soon as it's ready. The kitchen is open so you can what's going on back there if you care to. 

I like the ambience, the lunch crowd that isn't too crazy and quality food for an affordable price."}
{"text":"I have been to Market Grille Cafe a couple of times. It is kind of a fast casual Greek restaurant. The food is decent but not great. The last time we were there I got a gyro and my wife got the appetizer combo. I found the food to be a bit salty. However, things have been tasting salty to me lately, so maybe it's just me. My wife didn't think the food was too salty. The appetizer combo had a nice variety of items such as dolmens, falafel, and hummus."}
{"text":"Good Greek fare in a pleasant environment.  I really liked the pomegranate chicken.  Simple but tasty.  I recommend checking them out for good prices and good Greek food.  Opa!"}
{"text":"Market Grille Cafe is a great place to get Mediterranean food at a decent price.  I've been here many times and have tried plenty of desserts, loads of hummus, and....... the pomegranate chicken.  Love their basmati rice, love the chicken, love everything I've had.  The prices are affordable, the atmosphere works hard to be authentic, and the service is good.  4 stars instead of 5?  Doesn't stand out.  Never do I crave it.  It's one of those options where I'm really starving.. it's in the area... I've had a hot dog earlier... want something healthy now... instead of the In and Out... hey!  Market Grille Cafe!"}
{"text":"I really like this place my taste buds are tingling this is the best Greek food I've tasted yet I got the vasilios which was amazing and my hot mom got the moussaka with I thought was very melt in your mouth and flavorful! We ate so fast we forgot to take pix lol.  Next time I would skip the full meal and just get the entree,  didn't eat the salad or pita and hummus.  We will Def come back again,  oh and we also got 20%off our bill for checking in on yelp.  Super awesome staff"}
{"text":"The lunch special is really good here. You get to pick one main item and a side item for $8.95. I had a vegetable euro with hummus which was delicious and a side Greek salad. My server, Makenzi, was very polite and overall, I love this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The food is so delicious here. We typically get the skewers, but changed it up and went with the Traditional Gyro and Falafel Gyro our son got the Cheese Pita with Chicken. Every one of us enjoyed our meal. It was fast, hot and absolutely fantastic! Thank you Market Grille Cafe, we will be back next Friday night!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The atmosphere is amazing. The customer service is amazing. There's literally no reason not to come here lol"}
{"text":"We moved down the street from here almost 2 years ago and would always drive past it, but never stopped. We finally decided we wanted to try something different for dinner and decided to stop in. We got lucky and went in during happy hour. They have some discounts on wine and appetizers. We tried the appetizer sampler so we could try a bunch of different things since we weren't sure what any of them were. For the most part, everything was great. There were a couple things we didn't care for but it was because of our personal preferences in tastes. He got the greek trio so again we could try a few different menu items and I got the keftedes and they were both pretty good. You get a decent amount of food with your meal and a salad, hummus and pita bread. It was a lot more than I expected and I couldn't eat it all so I had almost a whole meal for breakfast. Next time I'll only order my meal and not an appetizer too because it was a lot. We got a dessert to try: the apollo's cheesecake and I absolutely love cheesecake, but I will say that I wasn't a big fan. I don't know what it was about it, but I just didn't like it. I was bummed that it wasn't as good as I was expecting. I don't think you can really go wrong with any of the food tho. Everybody has different tastes. We will definitely be going back to tr y some of their other platters."}
{"text":"Service everyone is so friendly but the food is so disappointing. Stuffed grape leave were cold and serve with cold butter lemon sauce that is so wrong. It's like they did it backwards. Cold grape leaves go with yogurt. Warm grape leaves with warm butter lemon sauce. Pastiso and rice was bland. The real disappointing part was listening to non Greeks say the food was really good. If you want tasteful Greek food wait for the Greek festival."}
{"text":"The food and service is always fantastic. We typically order out but we've eaten in and have never had any issues. Great spot for Greek food."}
{"text":"Always in the fight, but never a champion.

The Market Grill has a ton of good/safe options.  I come here regularly for lunch, and there are so many items that I can order and be content with.  The problem is that I never say to myself, \"Man, I'm really in the mood for _______ from Market Grill.\"   They will do in a pinch...and then some.  Plus, they often have a solid Yelp Check-in Offer or some other program going on.

I avoid the hummus here, but regularly take part in Gyros, Salads, Wraps, and Combo Plates.  I would give out 3 or 3.5 stars just on the food.  The service is always on though, they are accommodating here, and it is always clean...even during the lunch rush...so I settle at 4 stars.

Not authentic Greek or Mediterranean.  Certainly not my favorite for either, but one I frequent because it's convenient, I know what I'll get, and I appreciate friendly service."}
{"text":"What a nice, quaint, authentic restaurant!  This is my second time here and both times the food was great, service was great and prices are average."}
{"text":"This is a: No Doubt, Everytime You Go, Dine In or Carry Out FANTASTIC restaurant! 
     The Skewer meals are my favorite! The Pomegranate Chicken is Hubby's favorite, and the Pastitsio is my son's! 
     The Entree's are the way to go. You get a wonderful salad, humus w/ pita and wonderfulI basmati rice!
     If your sick, pick up some Avgolemno Soup, it's just what the Dr. ordered! By the by, the Pumpkin Baklava Cheesecake is to die for!!! 
Say Hi to Rose for me!!"}
{"text":"The best Greek food ive ever had. i enjoyed the dine in experience more than the take out, Market Cafe has the best wait staff ive ever seen."}
{"text":"Food is to dye for!!  Gyro meat is so tender and delicious!!  I can not get enough of their pomegranate chicken!!  Extra walnuts please!!!   Yum everything is fresh and orders come out fast!!  They're tiramisu cheesecake is deliciousness. The cheesecake compliments the tiramisu perfectly!!  Great service and tasty food!!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, im a Mexican food kind of girl. Very rarely do I try something different when I go out to eat but I'm glad we did tonight. Everything was very tasty and flavorful. I used to eat at Paymon's Mediterranean Cafe and this place makes them mediocre. I love that this place is family operated and we will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great atmosphere, amazing service, and delicious food.  Pricing is reasonable, my husband and I had 2 entrees and an appetizer for around $50. They have a decent wine selection.  We had the saganaki, which they set on fire at the table, very cool.  Our drinks were never left empty which I always appreciate in a busy place like this."}
{"text":"I especially love the fact that this place is family-owned. Some of the food was not that great and they have many Vegetarian/Vegan options to choose from. I ordered the falafel gyro with a side of hummus. I finally have come to the conclusion that the hummus has little to no flavor as well as the rest of the food that i've tried coming here. It taste extremely watered down, where's the tahini? The food is far from mind-blowing and I hate having that \"bland mindset\" after a meal as if I didn't get much out of it. The falafel was extremely bland and very dry. The salad that came with the gyro was very wilted. I want to really like this place but not sure if i'd want to go back."}
{"text":"food was very good. gyros wasn't too salty, but flavorful. pita bread was extremely soft. restaurant had a little water fountain that was relaxing to hear. however, the seating is a hassle. too many damn chairs and tables, very uncomfortable with everyone squeezed in. please take some of the chairs out and a few tables, then i'd give it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Such good service and they make you feel like family. I love Greek food and they have a great selection. My 9 year old loves the pomegranate chicken and lentil soup. Great atmosphere, friendly servers, amazing quality food. We went for Mother's Day and even though they were so busy they took time to come to our table and make sure we were ok and apologize for the wait. The manager even came over and my husband was sure to tell him how great our server was."}
{"text":"We were expecting something great based on the reviews on yelp. Unfortunately, it anything but alright at best. 

The pomegranate chicken was dry, the greek salad was not good (the dressing is vinegar based instead of olive oil and lemon), the stuffed peppers were a little bland, the hummus was pretty bad too. The rice was excellent. The lentil soup was excellent, too.

Our server was nice but she didn't understand my questions, which was weird. 

We left disappointed and won't be back."}
{"text":"My partner and I love this place! The food is deliciously inexpensive with a high quality homemade taste! Only problem is the portions aren't large enough! It always leaves us wanting more!"}
{"text":"OH My!  I just love veggie's and good food.......yes i love the spanikopita.  It was a welcoming visit, and felt like I was right at home.  The salad was excellent, lettuce was green, crisp, and fresh.  Prices were moderate, unfortunately at this visit I didnt get to taste the wine.  Next time........"}
{"text":"Not good not to bad, pomegranate chicken is to sweet, the rice was to dry, fries where to spice.... I think the best part was the Greek beer. I would not return again, better other Greek restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent service, fresh food, and delicious desserts! They have affordable lunch prices and their portions are good. Their banaganoush is one of the best. I get their stuff to-go a lot when on the way to a pot-luck and I don't have time to cook myself."}
{"text":"Eh. Everything feels \"faux\" here. Decor is faux Tuscan, food faux Greek. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"My little sister and I decided to try something new when we came across this place. The outside looked nice and the reviews were great, so we decided to give it a try. We were both so happy we did! The lunch menu is simple and affordable. Not to mention delicious!! If you like light, filling and quick food consider coming here. The gyros were my favorite and the tzatziki sauce appetizer is amazing!! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This our favorite Greek place. They're so nice here. The food is really good and the prices are decent. The service is great. Their lunch specials are under $10 with a drink. They have discounts specials throughout the week. We could eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"The gyros are the best! My husband and I love the traditional gyros. I usually utilize the call in service and they always have the order ready and waiting. The fresh made tsiazki sauce is the best I have had since we moved from Florida. I have yet to dine inside but look forward to trying new menu items."}
{"text":"I loved this place , especially my mom she was so giddy about the food and the atmosphere. We got the veggie gyro, with the platter of pita, rice, a salad. I feel the salad should be the whole spot light of the meal , because the dressing was more than to die for ! Best dressing ive ever had, the salad was so fresh and was gone in about 2 minutes. The gyro was splendid,  with the yogurt sauce, the rice was delicious. The pita itself was soft and still warm, but I didn't like the hummus at all .. it needed a little something to amp it up . But I did love the vanilla chai tea wowza, super good !I will be coming back very soon , loved the service.. The nice guy helped explain the menu, and once you order a joyous \"opa\" came from all the workers. After 4 , they serve you at your table .. There was beautiful hand painted artwork on the walls , and light and garland hung on the ceiling."}
{"text":"Simple system, very good food, great service, highly recommend.  Families, friends, lovers, single, it's a place for healthy and still tasty food.  When I am in LV next time, I'm stopping again."}
{"text":"3 stars only because the food tastes as great as I remember. I moved from the northwest in 2010 and had worked in the northwest since 2007. It's been awhile since I've visited Market Grille. I was so excited today because I was on the west side (since moving to Henderson in 2010) and I could go to Market Grille. I've always enjoyed their food. However, they have apparently gotten too big for their britches. I received 1 skewer of dime sized chunks of lamb and 1 skewer of tomatoes and onions. For the $13.00 price tag I usually get at least double the meat at my favorite Greek spot in Henderson (Greek Bistro) and it tastes just as good if not better. The service there is better as well, as I see the owner and her children every time I go there and not some random \"doesn't care\" cashier. Market Grille, in my opinion, has fallen off from what they used to be. Give your customers what they pay for. Good food, good portions, and Great service. The food was great but you fouled the bed in the other two departments."}
{"text":"I came here thinking the food was going to be decent from all these good reviews from fellow yelpers. I've come to the conclusion that every yelper from North Vegas has really bad taste in food or they're stuck in an area with atrocious food and they THINK places like this is actually good.

I started my meal with Falafels. Incredibly salty. They pressed the idea that everything is homemade at their location. Why isn't the chef or the cooks tasting any of the food before they're sent out? Don't order this unless you like making funny faces because the salt is overwhelming.

I ordered the filet tenderloin wrap and my date ordered a chicken skewer a la carte. My wrap was pretty bland and had barely any pieces of meat. It was mostly filled with carbs. My date's chicken skewer was dry. The best thing that came out of the kitchen was the vegetable skewer that came with the chicken skewer. 

If you want to get a really good chicken skewer, go to Crazy Pita. If you want some fresh falafels that are truly made to order fresh, go to Sababa's on Durango / Desert Inn. 

This place sucks. Wont come back. Haven't found a decent place to eat in North Vegas yet......... Running out of options ...."}
{"text":"I've passed this place numerous times, knew about it, but never tried it. I had a lunch meeting there, so I had no choice but to go -- and I'm so glad I did. 

I'm a huge fan of the \"order & sit\" style restaurants when I don't feel like going to an actual restaurant but don't want fast food. 

I had the Pomegranate Chicken with Basmati Rice, Greek Salad and Pita & Hummus. It was amazing. The staff is friendly, the atmosphere is nice and the restaurant is clean. They also have great gluten free and vegan options.

I'm going back tomorrow."}
{"text":"I got the spanokopita entree. It comes with herbed basmati rice, hummus, greek salad and spinach pie. Everything on my plate besides the hummus did not taste good. The spanokopita isnt fresh. The filo dough which is supposed to be crispy was soft and mushy almost like it was premade yesterday and reheated. Even the basmati rice had a strange flavor and texture of instant rice. The tzaziki sauce like another reviewer said tasted only of dill. This is my 2nd time trying this place since I wanted to give them another chance and both times have disappointed me. I don't understand how this place is voted 'Best of Las Vegas' 5 years in a row. Again as stated in another review, try Yassou on West Charleston. The owner is Greek and the food is authentic. Also another good place is The Great Greek Grill in Henderson. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"This place gets better and better each time I come here. Tonight was just a simple Greek Salad. The veggies in the salad were fresh and homemade. Great place for dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I have frequently visited (several times a week) Market Grille since the \"olden days\" when there was only one location and it was near Tropical Pkwy/89131.  The food and service and staff have consistently been great.  If you want a positive dining experience, please try EITHER Market Grille Cafe.  :-)  Thank you, Joe and Rhonda, and the family and staff!!!"}
{"text":"Every time we go I always find something I love!  Here are some pics from items we order on a regular.    I like the lamb burger,  the shrimp pasta,  the bowl, the soup, pretty much the whole menu!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Market Grille. A true family owned and operated place who simply wants to feed you well. Between the pasta dishes, the chicken entrees, and pizzas, and the kabobs, I could come here 3 to 4 days a week and eat different, semi healthy, and leave happy! 
The first time I ever dined in, the manager noticed we had never been in before, and gave us a coupon to return. She's said hi every time since. I love the personalized service. 
A couple of my personal favorites are the salmon skewers, and the mama Mia chicken. I also really enjoy the red pepper hummus. 
Everything is made from scratch, in house, and they add no msg to anything! There are nightly specials for discounts on wine, which they have a pretty decent selection of. Prices and portions are on point and I've never had even close to mediocre service here. A rare Mediterranean gem, don't pass it up!"}
{"text":"My first experience was when the restaurant first opened.  My boyfriend and I walked in and saw that there was not table service and the place was difficult to walk around in so we walked out and went somewhere else that night.  
The second experience was a take out order.  I walked in and was told that I could not place an order at the front and was told to walk around the restaurant to the other entrance and place an order there.  I wish I had been walked to that area, via the inside of the restaurant, and just been told that there was a separate entrance for take out orders so that I did not have to wait at the main entrance.  I ordered my meal and Rhonda was at the cashier station.  When I mentioned that I was from Tucson, AZ, she was even more welcoming and shared the history that she and Joe have with Tucson.  We exchanged business cards and they were both great and friendly.  The meal I took home was alright, nothing special but I thought I would try coming in and sitting down next time because the service format had changed and there was now table service.  Good idea.
The third experience was when my boyfriend and I walked in and we were first seated at a table in the middle of the room.  No thank you, we asked for a more private booth and were seated in a more comfortable area.  We noticed that every table that came in the restaurant was offered the same \"middle of the room table\" that we were offered and they all turned it down as well.  Our server was a young woman who was    friendly and welcoming,  I ordered the Jasmine tea after asking her she would recommend it or not, she said, \"I don't drink it so I don't know\".  I ordered it anyways and it was good.  She came back with our drinks and then took our order.  For an appetizer we ordered the Feta Cheese and Olive dish.  The chunks of cheese were too large and numerous, the olives were on the plate where the juices ran all over.  They should have been in a small bowl and then put on the plate.  The olives were pitted too and that is a sign of an inferior taste, and the flavor was strong but inferior.  They tasted like cheap olives.  I ordered the roasted chicken with potatoes and rice.  When the dish came I was so surprised that I was served the Back Bone Cut of the Chicken.  Never in my life have I ever served or been served the Back Bone of a chicken.  There are many very small bones that come off of the vertebra and the meat is tender but the pieces are difficult to get to with a knife and fork.  That is a piece saved for the stock pot.   I sent it back and was given a huge breast which was dry and over seasoned.  The meal was so bad that I ate three bites and we paid the bill and left.  I realize that this is not fast food and it is not a 4 star establishment but the food was not good and the servers are not well trained.  Our server filled our glasses every time we took a sip and checked up on us every 2 minutes, the knives were sent back because they were dirty, the food was terribly prepared, served and when we gave feedback we were looked at like we had two heads.  On top of it, when Joe came to the table to apologize, I reminded him of our previous meeting and he must not have heard one word that I said because he just stared at me and then went on about the food.  I owned 4 restaurants for many years and I know what good service is, this was poor service and poor food.  When the owner meets a customer, it is important to remember them because even when the food  is off for the night, the customer will give you another try.  For me, three strikes and you are out and I have a story that I will share with friends now."}
{"text":"OPA!\" is a Greek word that is heard often in the celebration of life!!  We need the word for AWESOME food!!  

This place rocks!!  The atmosphere is quiet and comfortable with pictures of Greece on each of the tables.  Service is spot on and the Owner is usually there to check on the newbies and give them a 15% off coupon on the next visit. 

You MUST have the Saganaki, fried Greek cheese with a lemon brandy sauce eaten on pita,  oh my!  Yummy! The Greek trio is a great way to try a few of the Greek dishes they have, my fav is the Masouka, almost like a shepherds pie but better. 
 
The pomegranate chicken is marinated overnight and is to die for, super tasty.  
All of their dishes are made on site from scratch and you can tell....really great food.  

I think this place is one of my new favorites - OPA!!!!"}

{"text":"If you folks have read my reviews. You know I'm very picky about my iced tea. Well this place has awesome green tea. And they make a great Arnold Palmer. The food you can't go wrong with. The classics are amazing gyro and falafels too. Must try is Pomegranate chicken, Greek Trio (Spanikopita, Mousaka and Pastitio too), Pasta Giovani and of course Sagnaki too. Trust me you'll love this place big time! Friendly service and great atmosphere too."}

{"text":"I would like to write a review for A girl named TATUM that works at the Durango location!!!! A guy took my order when I originally called in a to go order and he didn't seem too sure about any of the questions I asked regarding preparation. I was concerned when I hung up the phone that my order would not be correct. But, about a minute later Tatum called me and asked the questions about my order that I was concerned about!!! I love this restaurant and would have been very upset if I would have picked up my order and it was wrong or someone had made an assumption about how I wanted my food. I am picky about certain items and would have been really upset with someone guessing. 
But thank you Tatum for taking the time to call me and confirm how I wanted my wrap and confirming my order! Small attention to detail and caring enough to make sure that the customer will be satisfied means everything! 
My husband and I frequent Market Grille and I'm hoping Tatum is shown appreciation by her manager!
Thank you again Tatum."}

{"text":"Ordered the Lamb Gyro came with a tiny little thing of sauce. Most places I get a much bigger sauce container. Which I like. The Gyro had a very lite flavor. Felt like I was eating diet food which I don't like. Most the time I eat 1/2-3/4 of a Gyro and I'm full but I ate the whole thing and I was still hungry and No I'm not pregnant. I rather go to Gyro Time or Greek Cafe on the strip. I won't be coming back to this place. Also I think they spelled  tzatziki sauce wrong on their menu but I could be wrong so whatever. But the service was nice. All the workers greeted me and let me know what I ordered to double check everything is correct."}
{"text":"I often pretty easy going person but tonight I was absolutely not too pleased about my first experience at this place !  The place is clean and very well decorated , service was good , the waitress obviously tried her best to serve her tables, the place was not busy at all, I was there with my 4 kids  and my husband for father 's day dinner , it might seem like a nuisance sometime all theses kids  lol anyways the service was still quite slow despite all the waiters around the restaurant, my spinach salad the dressing was very good no complains but the salad itself looked out a bag :( I ordered the original gyro  I ate plenty of theses in Europe and the one i had serve was not even close to taste like the real thing , it was cold looks like p remade and left on the counter top  for quite sometime the sauce was dry the meat taste like pre-pack vegetarian meat !!! seriously ? i ate all of it i was very angry but honestly they wont see me back for the price !  the desert sent the whole meal to hell , the waitress told me it was a family recipe !!!!???? wouaaa  fake chocolate, plenty of confectioner sugar very hard and dry  cannoli  i had to tap that sucker open with my fork like a mad women , i should of brought some tools  and got really scare to brake my dental partials on that one . I didn't enjoy this father day meal and wont be back to this place. Nominated 5 time Best greek restaurant in Las Vegas ?????? did the dudes drink too many beers prior the nomination ?"}
{"text":"More than just good food. 
I do not usually eat much Mediterranean food, until I came here. The staff is very friendly and took the time to go over many of the menu option that I was unfamiliar with. Most importantly our server did this without making me feel like I was being talked down to, which is enough to make me come back. After placing our order our food came in a timely manner, which itself was excellent. It is clear that there is care and love put into every ingredient of every dish. The food was vibrant and flavorful. I ordered all vegetarian items but I did not miss not having meat. That being said, the care put into the vegetarian dishes makes me confident that there nonvegetaian selections are just as good. Best of all the food comes in generous portions and are fairly priced. I visited the Summerlin location and I will definatly be back for future dinning."}
{"text":"Why advertise your vegetarian & vegan options when in reality, they are quite limited...

Salads do NOT count & we usually eat hummus/baba ganoush at home, anyway.

Lady on the phone had to check the actual vegetarian/vegan-ness of every option- kinda frustrating when I am used to \"Mediterranean/Greek\" style food always having tons of options for me. Usually I can just ask for no yogurt or no cheese. I appreciated the honesty & the helpfulness, because I genuinely have dairy allergies & don't want to risk it.

We decided not to order, because we were hungry & needed a substantial meal (not just appetizers).

That said, I think it is a really, really, REALLY bad decision to add feta cheese to your falafel, because I know a lot of us vegans go for it on a pita on the weekly & I doubt your omnivores would genuinely miss it. It's not usually used, in my experience.

Why reduce your clientele over something that is usually \"accidentally\" vegan?"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant! Always amazing food. Never any issues. Food and staff are all amazing. Their blackberry jasmine tea and lemon cilantro humus.... to die for!!!"}
{"text":"I eat here 3 times a week. Best Mediterranean food around. Family owned and runned. I cannot get enough of their pomegranate chicken and their tiramisu cheesecake is to die for."}
{"text":"Ordering process: take a gander at their (bright and blinding) back-lit LED menus lined up in the entry-way, order your food at the counter, pay, they hand you a table number, take a seat, enjoy the smoke show (there was a cloud of smoke surrounding the restaurant, coming from the open kitchen - so much smoke! we felt like we were inside of a haunted mansion lol), they bring the food to your table. 

After much consideration, my boyfriend and I chose the Gyros, which have: lettuce, chopped red onions, tomatoes, cucumber, feta stuffed into a warm pita bread and topped with the choice of yogurt dill sauce or hummus.

My boyfriend went with the Traditional (beef/lamb) beef gyro (with yogurt dill sauce) $7.75 - The meat was more-so on the salty side, but the yogurt dill sauce helped cut the saltiness nicely. The size of this gyro was huge - there was more than enough food for him to become full and satisfied. 

I went with the Pomegranate chicken gyro (with yogurt dill sauce) $7.95 - The Pomegranate chicken had a pleasant, slight sweetness to it, but I could barely taste or make out any distinct \"pomegranate\" flavor. It was also charred black on some pieces, overcooked, tough and dry. This gyro was also a generous size - definitely big enough to stuff me silly. Although it was dry, I would most likely dabble in this gyro again.

For an additional $3.50, I turned my Gyro into a \"Gyro Platter\" which came with: 
- Greek salad - the zesty dressing was very vinegary and they barely gave any feta cheese. Also, the olives tasted great, but they only give you 3 tiny baby olives. 
- Basmati herb rice - the rice was very salty and the grains were extremely dried out. 
- Hummus & pita - the ratio of hummus to pita was un-proportional. The hummus wasn't bad, but they only gave us the tiniest container of it - it's not even substantial enough to comment on. The pita was cut up into 4 tiny points and tasted average. 

For a total of $11+ to turn the gyro into a platter, it wasn't worth it - the extras were not memorable. Just get the gyro, it's more than enough food to get filled up with. 

The yogurt dill sauce is what made the gyros enjoyable. It was refreshing and creamy. Whatever you do, get that sauce and drench the dry pomegranate chicken or the salty gyro meat in it - you will love it!"}
{"text":"Great food! Everything is very fresh. Quality food at a great price! Server was friendly and attentive. Chicken gyro was perfect. Chicken was moist and delicious. Pita bread tastes like it's freshly baked."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Las Vegas. The food is spectacular! Their yogurt dill dressing is fresh and the pita bread is delicious. I have been coming here for years and I never get tired of coming there is always something new to taste or te experience. 
Best combination Greek and Italian love it !"}
{"text":"Looking for a nice and reasonable resto, so we ended up here and to think so close to where we live. Nice place and good staff.. The owner was there too assisting and or helping them. She's so nice too. 
I had lamb roast gyro and my boyfriend had the traditional gyro. We had the traditional platter as our appetizer . Food was delish,and salad was fresh , loved it. 
Would recommend this place and I'll go back their again..plus the owner gave us a 15% discount card on the next visit. And oh if you have a LVAC member card you have a discount ( show it upon paying)."}
{"text":"I am updating my review. Salad is now tossed fresh, no more wilted greens. The chicken to pita ration is on point. I had no complaints. Very delicious."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about this restaurant, we left here terribly disappointed. Gyros were cold and tasteless, the salad with the gyro platter was watered down and soggy, and the service was uncoordinated and sporadic. 

Dessert was the best part of this meal, and that isn't saying much. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Really good cafe! Food is amazing. We took chicken gyro and combination of stuffed tomato and pepper. Also tried greek salad and rice, so good)) we want to come back and try their deserts! From 4-6 happy hour, $2 off appetizers. So we ordered fries for $2 only! Its so fresh and tasty)"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place to grab a quick lunch.  Ordered a traditional gyro(beef and lamb).  The meat was nice and tender, still moist  and a good portion. The meat could use a little more spices and seasonings and the veggies were not dressed but they were very fresh.  I agree with the other posters about the cheesy decor but it's very clean and nice inside.  I would give this a place more of a 3.5 stars because my portion was a good size and it cost only $8.62 and that came with a drink and I ordered extra hummus(yeah hummus slut, what of it?)."}
{"text":"Finally I have found a good place to go to when I'm craving Mediterranean food. I ordered the classic gyro (lamb meat) and got it in a platter which included a salad, rice, and hummus with pita bread. The salad was small and tasty. Not sure what the dressing was but it was light and slightly sweet. I love hummus and theirs is very good. The rice and gyro were delicious and had a lot of meat. The only problem with the gyro is it didn't have enough sauce for me (but I like a good amount on my gyros.) Definitely go with the yogurt dill sauce on the gyro. It's a nice family owned restaurant with an overall pleasant atmosphere. It was so nice out that night that my boyfriend and I ate in the outside patio area. It's very cute and romantic. I'll be back soon to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"We had  a nice family dinner.  My sister ordered appetizers: the hummus trio, delicious with traditional, red pepper and basil and spinach hummus.  All yummy.  Then came the saganaki - flaming cheese doused in lemon and brandy - delicious. Then our entrees: Sis had the trio, mousaka, spanokapita and  Pastitsio.  I tried all three - loved the Pastitsio, pasta pie covered in beef and a yummy bechamel topping with a taste of cinnamon and nutmeg. Wonderful!  Mom had the delicious Pomegranate Chicken, so yummy. I had my go to chicken skewer platter - chunks of spice covered chicken with the fluffy white rice.  We all had great Greek salads which come with the dinners, with tomatoes, cucumbers, chunks of feta cheese, red onions and kalamata olives.  Something so simple but delicious.  Then the highlight of my meal, which didn't come until later that evening, was the Pumpkin Cheesecake.  I had this a few years ago -- but didn't quite remember how wonderful this is.  With the baklava crust, then layered finely chopped nuts and cinnamon with brown sugar, then the pumpkin cheesecake layer, covered in a dollop of whipped cream sprinkled with spices.  Yumminess!  That is one of the best cheesecakes ever!  Try this out -- you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I love the spinokopita, the pomegranite chicken - their rice is light and fluffy.  Even the desserts - try the pumpkin/baklava cheesecake - very yummy.  Oh and the pumpkin walnut soup - very creamy and rich."}
{"text":"Yep! I'm back because I am a fan, especially of 3 words on their menu! 

Pumpkin Mushroom Soup! 

If you like pumpkin with flavor.. you will love this soup... Drove all the way across town to have a cup. Met my expectations! 

Then I decided to order something different and simple... of course, a gyro! It looked delicious, a generous pile of meat, lettuce, tomato, onion with cucumber sauce all wrapped up in pita bread!  The pita bread was soft, warm and tasted great. Unfortunately the meat had no seasoning which resulted in no flavor. A few too many diced onions for my taste. Ok to eat, but I have had better. This is the first thing I have ever ordered here that I didn't like.. But that won't stop me from coming back! 

The service is great! Rose greets you at the door as though you are coming into your home and a server immediately greets you! If you have a question about the menu, everyone is very knowlegable about all the dishes The food is always served hot and tastes great!

Even though I didn't like my gyro, I will soon drive across town again for the Pumpkin Mushroom Soup and something else I have not tried yet on the menu!"}
{"text":"Fast food atmosphere, and  not impressed with the so called \" Homemade Greek  Food\"  I had.  Their Stuffed Tomatoes are  not like the Greek ones at all, wasn't even impressed with the greek salad or the gyro, I don't know what country the yia yia cookies are from,  but they sure aren't Greek, they had no taste, a real yia yia (greek grandma) would have made them right and so tasty .  Whoever thinks this is great Greek food should visit a REAL authentic Greek restaurant and compare. Can't believe it was voted Best of Las Vegas ."}
{"text":"Get your Greek food elsewhere. With Greek and Mediterranean restaurants a dime a dozen in Vegas, I'd recommend you get yours at a place with more flavor. From the taste it is clear diet yogurt is used to create the sauces. While this causes fewer calories, but also a gross taste. Owner is also a giant Asshole and has been shown to participate in illegal practices, so I'm not really sure how this restaurant is even still opened. There is a strong reason why this place stopped winning best of Las Vegas out of the blue. It surely doesn't deserve it. Even his own employees have told me how big of an asshole the owner Joe is."}
{"text":"I love this place! Whenever my family and I go here they are always so welcoming even if the place is crowded. The atmosphere is wonderful. The food is so delicious, super authentic! The Aphrodite Cheesecake is so good I always get two so I can take one home!"}

Both awesome. Our 14 y/o had pasta Angelo with shrimp and couldn't stop saying how good it was. I wish we had more time for dessert as I'm a fan of baklava, but I KNOW we will be back. Our server, Frances, was super sweet and very helpful with the menu and to top it all off, she relayed to the manager that it was our first time here and he personally came over to talk to us and invite us back...wait for it...WITH A 15% OFF CARD! Very impressed with the friendly service here. Thanks, Sean (Shawn?) and Frances!!"}

Polite and professional.

Food:
I ordered the Filet Tenderloin ($12.25) - take out
Meat was horrible, very dry , weird taste and smell , straight to garbage
Veggie skewer was very bad, bitter, I did spit it out right away, garbage as well.
Fries , salad were average, bread was ok.

Totally waste of time and money. 

Vegas standards..."}
{"text":"My first day driving my car in Las Vegas 110 degree heat and within 10 minutes, my AC died on me. I haven't had time to get it repaired, and between training, filling out paper works, and driving all over to get errands done, I was doing the Ace Ventura and driving with my head out the window to get some air!

I ended up going a full 24 hours without eating, being very dehydrated, overheated, and sore from training. Not a good idea in retrospect, but such is life. After finally getting a gallon of water in me, I decided to come here for lunch. I welcomed the cold A/C and was sat down right away. The waiter was quick and to the point, and I get my order in right away. 

For starters, I had the falafel, that came out with hummus. First thing I tasted was the hummus, and it wasn't good. It was more pasty than creamy, and a jar of sabra hummus was way better than this, which isn't a good sign. The falafel was also doughy on the inside, and had a weird taste to it. Not horrible, but not good.

Next was a greek salad. This was good. Fresh and seasoned just right away. Was a welcome relief from the starter.

For my main, I had the pomegranate chicken entree. This was good too. The chicken was tender and flavorful. Nothing out of this world, but a good dish for sure. The rice that came with it was also good. The pita and hummus where a miss here too, and I just left them.

Finally, I had the aphrodite cheesecake. The idea of a baklava cheesecake was very intriguing, as I love baklava. Unfortunately, this was not a good rendition. The cheesecake was just a standard, run of the mill cheesecake. The baklava crust left a lot to be desired.

Overall, this was okay. But considering that I was starving, my taste buds should have magnified the flavor significantly. Instead, I was very underwhelmed. I won't be coming back. I may have been spoiled by Cleo, which U know is not a fair comparison to a place like this, but this is just too far below to justify coming."}
{"text":"I have been through two pregnancies with Market Grille Cafe Pomegranate Chicken as my must have honey drive over there before they close because I have got to have it food. 

The staff was always wonderful every time I called to place my order for my long suffering husband to come in and pick up. 

I love everything on the menu. This is the place we bring our out of town relatives who eat gluten restricted diets. Everything tastes and feels fresh and healthy. Never a disappointment. 

The dining area is small but there are tables outside for a great evening meal. 

Finish with the baklava cheesecake and you will be in heaven."}
{"text":"Great, fresh food! We arrived late and were treated warmly. Friendly staff. Really enjoyed our meal will go back again soon. Reasonable too..."}
{"text":"I just love, love, their lunch time platters, very filling and the staff is always so pleasant! I can not tell you how happy I am that they moved closer to my house. I almost always have the same thing, Gyro with salad and rice plate, and love that they have their house wine of Barefoot! It makes for a fabulous afternoon with my BFFs!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Vegas! I have an affinity for their blackberry Jasmine tea! My boyfriend and I dine here all the time! We Love the rosemary pita, plates potatoes and baklava!! even y dog loves their food, she always steals my left overs!"}

The food was absolutely Divine and the owner was very involved in the restaurant I saw him even serving coffee. Everybody from the hostess to the waitress to the owner were exceptionally wonderful people all of them had Smiles on their faces and all of them are extremely helpful. I highly recommend this for your next Greek taste for dinner and don't forget to try the baklava"}
{"text":"Light, not greasy like some Greek places. Traditional gyro was good and had lots more than just meat. Spanakopita was perfectly flaky and tasty. The rice has a distinct flavor some might like (olives?), but I wouldn't get again."}
{"text":"The chicken kabobs kick serious arse! Affordable, good service, quick!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and booth times the food ok but the service sucks.... 

tonight I left a $.00 tip.  I wasn't going to but when I got up to get find my bill and pay, my waiter was at the register so I said to him,  \"man what lame service tonight... I never seen you after you took our order, no one ever came by to check if we needed anything, no drink refills, no napkins and I'm with a toddler..

Here's his tip: When a guest complains before paying their bill, they are giving you a chance to fix their dining experience.  The most neutral thing you could have said and still salvaged a portion of your tip would have been, \"I'm so sorry\"....

Instead, he says, \"yeah we're busy, mother day weekend and I have a group.\""}
{"text":"We enjoyed every aspect of our meal.  The staff was super friendly and attentive, and made the meal even more fun.  We noticed that everyone there seemed to be having a good time!  Every item we ordered was delicious and lived up to what we were hoping for.  We will be back and try even more items!"}
{"text":"This place boast \"fast fresh mediterranean\" and that's exactly what you get! Basically it's your typical Greek food with some different twists. I learned that this place is a family owned and family run restauarnt and you can tell by the quailty of the food and the great service you get when you come. All the flavors are really fresh and flavorful. Some things I recommend:

Saganaki: it's literally flamming cheese! They bring it out on an iron skillet and light in on fire table side. Awesome presentation and even more awesome flavors. You eat the cheese with toasted pita bread and it was so delicious!! It's a great appetizer. 

Pomegrante Chicken: I love it in the Gyros because I can eat it like a sandwich or over-sized taco. The chicken was very juicy and fresh. I couldn't taste the pomegrante flavor very much, but the dill dressing gave it a nice touch. 

Pumpkin Baklava Cheesecake: can I say AMAZING!?!? If you love cheesecake and if you love anything Pumpkin, this is the perfect dessert for you! The crust is a baklava crust, which basically means it's flakey like a pie crust instead of crumbly like a normal cheesecake crust. So good!

Overall, this was a very nice, fresh, and overall very guilt-free meal. Everything was just so healthy (with an exception of the cheesecake) that I wouldn't feel guilty eating here multiple times a week!"}
{"text":"I MUST SAY that wifey and I are presently bandaging each other's finger injuries from the frequent bleeding that comes from gnawing at them while carelessly, and speedily, inhaling this food. Wow! FANTASTIC is the only word that comes to mind.

As stated in my tip, to start with the aesthetics, it's a beautiful setting to dine in; ambiance is on point.

Then, the Yelp recommendations never fail me. The food reviews were great. I went with the traditional Gyro. I can only recall having one once or maybe twice in my life, so this was a adventurous choice. The breading wrap was like being forced to eat the best pillow you've ever slept on. Then you get to the ingredients on the inside - meat, salad, yogurt-dill sauce - magical! The amount, textures, flavor was perfect.

The second order was Pomagranate Chicken which was soooo unexpected, and Greek salad. This chicken was amazing! 6-8 slices of perfectly moist, perfectly tender meat that seemed to be flavored with the perfect hint of Pomagranate, as if the Pomagranate Chicken was a divinely created animal by God \"on the 5th day.\" Can anyone disprove that the Pomagranate Chicken hasn't always been around!? 

I have never had anything like these dishes. But for this experience, I would regularly pass over Greek food lacking interest. This experience makes me look out for Greek food like I need my next fix. Thank you, LV!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are addicted to this food. Particularly the lentil soup and pomegranate Chicken. We come here and least 4-5 times a month. Not including the trips I make for takeout lunch. We visited today 2-2-18 for lunch around 1. We sat outside and Cody was our server. He was prompt and outgoing. We always know what we want when we get there and he had no problem taking our full order. The food came out hot and delicious, as usual. We use the Epoxy app to get our frequent diner points, it's a great program. Overall we live this place and we hope to get Cody as our server again. I call in my lunch order on a regular basis and to to-go servers are always great. Oh! And the white was be sangria was so yummy! Thank you all!"}
{"text":"The food is always great! However, this Epoxy app has got to go!! I know it's been years, but it's awful and I miss the old system with real punch cards. Every time I go to scan something, the punch card changes so it makes it nearly impossible to fill up your card because it disappears and you have to start all over with a new card. For example, it used to be: A) buy a pomegranate chicken, get a stamp; B) buy a dessert, get a stamp; C) buy an entree, get a stamp. Now it's get a stamp for every $10 you spend. By the time I come back, it will likely change again! Furthermore, the app hardly works. I reset the app multiple times and could not get the camera to work. The cashier at Take Out wrote a note on my receipt to bring in next time and hope that the app works then so they can give me the stamps from today's visit. This was all after I asked her if they had a back up system for when the app fails. Technology is great, until it doesn't work. Management should have a back up plan for this kind of error. The cashier stated she said had seen this error with the camera before. 

Also, I was expecting to see the Take Out area full since all the designated spots were taken out front... NOPE! I was the only one there. Note to customers, read the signs and don't park there if you aren't taking out."}
{"text":"I've visited this location of Market Grille twice lately. There's a great lunch special on weekdays that includes a choice of multiple entrees with one side for under $10. I recommend the falafel gyro with fries as a reasonably healthy but quick lunch option plus there's a 20% off deal if you check in on Yelp! The pomegranate chicken is also very popular.
The restaurant is clean and comfortable and the staff is more than pleasant. All around great experience."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. I had the Vegenini, it is like a vegetarian pizza. I loved it. The potato fries are also delicious. Customer service is always friendly."}
{"text":"I've tried the chain Gyro Time and was really put off to Greek food here in Vegas until Market Grille opened and published coupons. We gave them a try and were impressed. We didn't dine in, but 'took out' a few times and aside from the greek side salad being a little wilted, the food just rocked. They have become my go-to place for food on the rare occasion we dine out. I agree with a previous review about the hummus, just killer!"}
{"text":"For the best experience at Market grille eat here for dinner. Lunch service is more casual and quick with customers ordering at the counter, but dinner consists of table side wait service. 

Pumpkin fans have to try the pumpkin mushroom soup. Perfect for the cold weather, the smooth, creamy soup has a pronounced pumpkin flavor in this vegetable-based soup. The Greek salad that accompanied my entree was perfect for sharing. The chicken skewer entree comes with one skewer full of moist, well seasoned cubes of chicken and a veggie skewer with red and green peppers, onions, and mushrooms. The Greek trio entree was perfect for sampling the spanakopita, moussaka, and pastitsio. The spanakopita was excellent with its flaky layers of pastry covering gooey cheese and spinach. The moussaka showed some great flavors with beef, eggplant and potatoes covered in a béchamel sauce. Rice, typically an afterthought with most dishes, was buttery and soft with a lightness that is all too rare.

Dinner prices are affordable, service was friendly and efficient, and the execution of all our dishes was spot on. Market Grille may have made its way into my rotation of inexpensive dinners with one of the best Mediterranean meals I've had lately."}
{"text":"Great fresh food. Isis, a manager, was very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Such an amazing restaurant! One of my favorite everything is made from scratch and taste great!! A must go!!"}
{"text":"Wow, incredible service! I think if I remember correct I had Kate and Katie as my server, one was in training, however I thought she was ready to be on her own (she did very well). The two were just awesome, and the main server was there the whole way guiding me through the menu on what I could and couldn't eat due to me being a vegan (besides eggs). 

Even when I thought I just wanted water, the one in training mentioned a jasmine blackberry iced tea and I was sold. Everything I had was very tasty and I wanted to just keep ordering stuff but I was so stuffed. 

What I ordered: hummus (original style w no cheese), tabouli, vegetable wrap with the spinach tortilla, jasmine blackberry tea.

Seriously so yum! I travel here for work so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I frequently think about this place when I go next door to Viet Bistro. I just never had the courage to go in and try the food. I'm not too big on Greek foods. I've ate it couple times but always had an experienced person with me to help me order. 

After the gym one of my friends said this place was really good so we decided to eat here. 

You order your food and then you sit down and they'll bring your food to you. I decided on the lunch special (around $8). There's a list of food you can choose from for the lunch special. I got a chicken gyro with avgolemono soup. It doesn't come with a drink so you have to order that separately. 

Chicken gyro- chicken was kind of dry. The yogurt sauce that go with the gyro is usually my favorite part. But their yogurt sauce was a bit on the sour side so it wasn't the taste I was used to. The portion is pretty big though. 

Avgolemono soup- it's a creamy lemon soup with chicken and rice. Oh I did not like that at all! It was way too sour for me.

The food didn't take too long but it didn't come out quick either. The workers were nice and helpful. I don't want to cross this place off my list just yet but I probably won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"This is my Gyro place after getting my nails done. The staff is friendly and make you feel welcomed. Food is fresh and the gyro meat is juicy. Wish I lived closer so I could go more often."}
{"text":"I had the traditional gyro and I loved it! The portions are huge and very filling. Service is quick and efficient."}
{"text":"I love this place. We are creatures of habit. So much so that Frances has pretty much memorized our order. Let me just say that the cauliflower soup is a triumph. The traditional gyros are amazing. When I have strayed from my usual order, I've not been disappointed. They have an excellent rice pudding. Things I've had that were A+ : gyros, chicken skewers, Greek salad with gyro meat, cauliflower soup, avgolemono, falafel, grape leaves, hummus, saganaki, rice pudding, worlds best desert (chocolate baklava cigars) nothing has disappointed. I'll eventually work my way through the entire menu. The lunch specials are very cost effective. Love this place."}
{"text":"Love, love, love.... did I say I LOVE This place? Good food, good ambiance & good service. Ask to be seated at Malaysia's section"}
{"text":"Quality food and service with a smile. Fast seating and good selection. Great for families or couples looking for a lunch spot. Greek and Italian dishes. I love the gyro of course! Close to my home. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Asked to sit outside and were walked to a dirty table with nothing on it, no utensils, or basket with salt and pepper or chili bottle. Waitress said she would be right back with the items. Ordered ice tea when she came back to wipe down table she sat us at. Waited and waited and she came back to take our order and reminded her about the ice teas. Still no utensils. Usually they bring salads right away. Finally got ice teas, no salads yet. Finished glass of ice tea, waitress passed and said she would bring out some more tea, got tea and still no salads. Filled up tea and still no salads. I get that Saturday nights are busy but they were no busier then I have seen them in the past. Finally salads come out. Told the gentleman who delivered thanks and let him know that utensils would be nice, he said \"I will be right back with some\". Waiting, now our main entree comes and still waiting on those utensils. Guess we will start on the entrees if we ever get those utensils, as the salad can stand to sit awhile. I look at window where there is a \"HELP WANTED\" sign. I love this place and the food is wonderful but they really do need to find help because I feel it may make a difference in having repeat customers. I would have given less stars but the food is really wonderful, but the service leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Love this place. Every time I am there, everyone is really nice and the service is excellent.  Great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I give a star for the food, but the customer service has been horrible, especially since the move to the new location. I order for pick up frequently and I always have to go above and beyond to make sure they get my order right. I always ask for chopped olives in my gyro. At one point, they had forgotten the olives and I called the manager to complain, the manager replied that I should've checked my food before I left. I said I did check my food, its hard to see the olives because they usually put them under the meat, so I asked the cashier if the olives were in there, and she said yes. Then he told me, well if you still weren't sure, you shouldve called for a manager. Seriously?? So I have to check my food, ask the cashier if she took the order down right, AND call for a manager, all just to make sure that the order is done right which is THEIR job in the first place. 

Yesterday, I ordered for pick up the exact same way I usually do, but this time they put the olives on the side and they weren't chopped. So I asked the lady if they could put it in the gyro, chopped. She then told me that I didn't specify to have it on the gyro. I told her, I always come here and I never usually have to say that, they usually have it in the gyro. She then said, well you can't expect us to memorize your order. 

Hmm..if I get pizza at Pizza Hut and I say, can you add sausage, they don't usually put in on the side. If I go to Burger King, and I said add onions in my burger, they don't usually put it on the side. At the very least, if they weren't sure, they would ask \"do you want it on the side\" before they do. They don't have to memorize my order for that. 

Bottom line, don't order pick up from here. And if they mess up your order, expect them to get a really defensive attitude about it before they fix it. Whatever happened to good customer service? Its nice to see a family owned business do well, but most family owned businesses have better customer service than they do. Whether it's poor training on the cash registers or poor customer service training, I doubt they will ever fix the problem, because they always seem to blame it on the customer than look at what's wrong with their service model."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Friendly staff. Small portions but filled us up. Highly recommend this  restaurant for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in town. I am at a loss trying to understand the poor reviews of this place. Fantastic atmosphere, incredibly friendly staff, loved the tv's over the menus that helped with selection, food came fast but was also fresh. The gyros had tons of meat, they did not skimp. I had the combination platter on which everything was amazing. The food I had here was a thousand times better than the food I had in Greece. There is not only thing I would have changed about this place. I will continue to eat here and will definitely recommend it to anyone looking for Greek food or just a great place. Also, I am a bit of a sanitation freak and the place was spotless."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite place... pomegranate chicken didn't have no flavor, the restaurant was frizzing and toke like 15 minutes to get my check.."}
{"text":"Our go to weeknight restaurant. Great service and staff and we never leave disappointed!

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The salmon is pretty good but I didn't like how weird the menu is. They had like lamb, weird cheeses, and just gross things. The rice was bomb. Probably won't come back..."}
{"text":"Solid 4 star stuff here, love the greek, not the best I ever had, but damn its so close I do it often due to convenience and service, price is good, not cheap, but thats why its better than a 3 star cheap gyro place, its got the specialties, like rolled grape leaves, the grilled meats, and cucumber sauces...get some...yum yum , get in my tum tum...mmmmm....licking chops thinking about it....slurp!  solid"}
{"text":"Awesome food, atmosphere and Sangria.  Our waiter Thom was knowledgeable and very friendly"}
{"text":"The food was REALLY good and the waiters were the most polite and friendly I have met in a long time. This is absolutely a 5/5. The prices are reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Pomegranate chicken was too sweet and not savory. Big disappointment.  Needed to ask for real olive oil for salad, the vingagrette had cheap oil.  Also they only had dairy substitute not real half and half for coffee. Good service but  the food was less then to be desired."}
{"text":"Fabulous fresh food and amazing service! Just moved to the neighborhood and stumbled in for lunch and I'm blown away with greatness! I had a question about the soup and the server was so nice and brought me samples of 3 different kinds. All 3 were so good I couldn't decide which to order. The food was fresh, healthy and delicious and the server was super knowledgeable about all the ingredients and loved telling us about everything. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Rhonda is the owner and is absolutely sweet. 
The food is fresh and divine. 
Ordered the platos potatoes and the Greek trio. 
The pumpkin and mushroom soup is a great fall dish. Smells sweet because of the cinnamon. I definitely recommend if you want to try something different and enjoy the beautiful interior design of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great services and the Pumpkin Cheesecake is to DIE for!  Heading back tonight, I can taste the Gyro now . . ."}
{"text":"First time and it was pretty good! I go to this area often but for some reason I always thought this place was a grocey store but my boyfriend's brother suggested to go during the break between soccer games and let me know it was actually a Greek food place.
Their menu consists of gyros, salads, entrees with rice, kabobs, appetizers and desserts. Their baklava looked really fresh and thick so I'll probably try that next time. You order at the counter and then you choose a table and they bring it to you.
I ordered the pomegranate chicken with basmati rice lunch special for $7.50 and my boyfriend ordered the traditional (lamb & beef) gyro with fries lunch special for also $7.50. Even with the lunch special, they let us use the 20% off your entire bill from checking in! Great deal!
Both were really flavorful! The pomegranate chicken tasted as if they marinated the chicken in sweet fruity horchata lmao and I don't mean that in a bad way lol it was also moist. Basmati was also good.
The traditional gyro was moist and flavorful and I liked that the meat was sliced a little thinner but they still gave a lot of meat. The sauce was good and tangy as well. Fries were fresh and came with a good sauce.
The workers were friendly, food was quick and atmosphere was fresh and clean with nice decor. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO HUMILIATED OR BELITTLED. 
This was my first and last time coming here. I was so upset that I had to take a week before writing this review, so that I could be calm and honest about my experience.
I came here with Ben S. on the evening of January 17th 2018 at around 7pm. As we walked in we were greeted by the hostess which took us to our table. Our waitress came and offered us drinks, I ordered a hot tea because I was sick and Ben a soda. She asked if we were ready to order, we were not since it was our first time and she didn't seem happy that we were still looking over the menu. It's ok, I didn't mind, we all have bad days, I still smiled and asked for her to come back. Soon a booth over to our right freed up and we asked the hostess if we could move to the booth because I was sick and the cold air from outside was hitting me. A booth would have provided a block from the cold and she was so kind in saying we could move. She helped me move my utensils and my tea over to the booth and we sat down again. Ben and I started talking and within what felt like 10 seconds a woman came charging at us and yelling from half way across the restaurant. \"You guys can't sit here, we were cleaning this table up for someone else!\" I wish I was exaggerating when I say that she came over yelling from half way across the restaurant. I wish I was making it up that she was making us get up and move our stuff to the first table we were at. I wish I could tell you that the tables around us weren't all staring at us as we were forced to walk back to our table. We didn't say anything, maybe because we were in shock as to how we were being treated, we quietly went back to our table and we sat down again. The hostess came over and deeply apologized because she didn't know they were cleaning the table for someone else, someone who had just walked in. Ben looked at her and told her \"Weren't we here first?\" she agreed but it was out of her hands and clearly she was intimidated by the woman who had come over and yelled at us. Soon our waitress came back to take our order, Ben asked her for the woman's name who had yelled at us and we were told it was Shelly. I don't know if it was her real name or not but she was an older caucasian woman with blonde hair who was over by the bar most of the time. Ben then proceeded to ask for the check for our drinks instead of placing a food order. Our waitress said ok without hesitating and came back with the bill. We paid for our drinks and left, on our way out catching a glance at a couple that were nodding their heads in disbelief. What they didn't know was that just two days prior we had experienced a loss in our family and this was the first time we had left the house. It took everything in me not to cry as I got up and left from the utter humiliation and disbelief. So many things went wrong here and nothing was done about it. No one on staff cared that we left except maybe the hostess who was very kind the entire visit. NEVER, EVER is it acceptable to treat a paying customer or any human being for that matter in this way. We were humiliated, sad, angry, and every other feeling you can feel when you are belittled in front of dozens of people. I understand when sometimes a restaurant needs to move people, it's happened to me before but they handled it much differently. By first coming over quietly, then asking if it is ok that we move, then offering something for the trouble. I don't even care they they offer a free dessert or not, it they just ask nicely I will gladly move, but that's just an example of what other places have done. All in all, that is what happened with all honesty and nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good prices.  Hadn't been here for a while and it was worth the return visit.  The menu has changed and now they have table service for dinner.  My husband and I both had the lamb skewers with rice and it was delicious.  Will definitely be back there soon."}
{"text":"We have been to both of the Market Grill Cafe's and they are consistently good.  We sat outside and it was very pleasant.  My husband and I both ordered the lamb skewers which came with a greek salad, the lamb skewer, a vegetable skewer, rice, hummus and pita bread.  The menu said the vegetable skewer consisted of peppers, onions and mushrooms yet when our dinners were brought the skewers were with tomatoes and onions.  When I asked for the skewer as described on the menu they did accommodate us but the manager said that was not the description on the menu.  He came back shortly to tell me that I was right and he was wrong.  They are in the process of printing a new menu which will have different veggie skewers for the lamb than all the other skewers.

The waiter did not ask how we wanted the lamb prepared and it was a little overcooked but otherwise everything was very good.  When we go back I will have to remember to tell the waiter that I want it med. rare."}
{"text":"I have to admit that my experience with Greek/Mediterranean food is pretty limited. I have maybe eaten at 20 such places in my life and MGC is one of the best that I can recall. 
The ordering process for lunch 11:30-3 is limited to a build your own menu. Place your order, pay, then sit ,and your food will be brought to you.
Dinner is a sit down/full service/full menu type experience so make sure you check your watch before you come depending on what type of service you would like. 
I like the vegetarian/ vegan options they offer. 
I have had dine in and take out here. Both were of good quality with friendly service and food was fresh and very tasty. So yes, I will be back and I'll encourage my friends to join me. 
PS. The parking lot is always busy so be prepared to drive slowly and carefully while you search for a spot."}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant was great ! The owner Rhonda even came to our table , greeted us and made sure that we were ok . Not only is the service incredible the food is delicious too ! 10/10 would recommend  . Will definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"Place is good. 

The stand out is the pumpkin soup. 

Everything else was solid but the true star was the pumpkin soup. 

The appetizer plate was solid. A lot to eat. Hummus, baba ganoush, tabouleh, pita, grape leaves. It's bomb. 

Tell me what you think!

{"text":"Best Greek food in the area. Very fresh with a cool atmosphere. Always clean with a friendly staff and great service. I recommend the stuffed tomatoes."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times now and loved everything. The greek salad has yummy dressing and real feta. The pomegranate chicken is delicious and like nothing I've had before. The traditional greek dishes are amazing. Clean and nice looking place."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this! I got chicken shawarma and husband got beef shawarma. Both were excellent. Portions were very generous. Employees were super nice. If only they would open a location in the northwest!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love their food.  I am addicted to their pumpkin mushroom bisque, Platos fries and of course-their gyros. Great atmosphere, excellent service and excellent food. I am not sure why they have a low rating. I truly love their food. 
If you want fancy greek dishes go somewhere else. This is mamaMs kitchen that serves Greek comfort food. I will definitely dine here regularly.
Tips: try the tenderloin skewers, lamb gyro, fries, pumpkin soup and their desserts."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great Greek food outside of the usual drive thru fare in Vegas, please take a moment to stop by this restaurant.  On a whim we walked in for lunch, only to find ourselves happy and giddy at the range of choices on their menu.  Not only do they serve wine and beer, but they have different Greek fare than the other restaurants, such as pumpkin mushroom soup, freshly made (not canned) dolmades, and pomegranate chicken for gyros and as a skewer.

We ordered the traditional gyro, hummus and baba with pita, as well as a chicken skewer, pumpkin mushroom soup, dolmades and their butter cookies.  All of it was excellent and nicely priced.  I have to say that their food is better than my previous favorite Greek restaurant, hands down.

If you're looking for take out or a nice place to sit and eat, stop by your nearest Market Grille Cafe and have a gyro.  I have to suggest the pumpkin soup because it was out of this world.  And if you are in the mood for interesting dessert, please have their butter cookies or their cheesecake. 

Excellent food at excellent prices."}
{"text":"Really cute restaurant with great customer service and amazing food! 

Came here with 3 friends during lunch time and the place was pretty busy. There's a large menu on the wall when you walk in and once you decide what you want, you can order at the cash register. They have AMAZING lunch specials for only $8.50... gyro, Mediterranean wraps, chicken & veggie kabob with a drink and your choice of sides: rice, fries, greek salad... If you check in on yelp you'll get 20% off which will bring your total to around $7.50 after tax. 

The food comes out very quickly. I ordered the traditional gyro (beef and lamb) with the yogurt dill sauce & a greek salad. The pita bread that they use to wrap everything in was so soft. I've been to other places where the pita bread was very chewy and hard. They do give A LOT of meat and I had a hard time eating the gyro so I eventually dumped everything out on top of my salad. All the ingredients were super fresh and the dressing for the greek salad wasn't overwhelming. 

My friend got the Mediterranean wrap with a spinach tortilla and pomegranate chicken. She got it with fries that came with a really good dipping sauce. The fries were crispy but not burnt and perfectly seasoned. 

We also shared cannolis. I've only had cannolis twice before and didn't really like them. The cannoli here had a creamy cinnamon filling and a crunchy shell. I couldn't get enough of the filling!

I came here twice in a row and can not wait to come back."}
{"text":"This was our first time dining here. It was honestly, just okay. The environment is comfortable and casual. We were greeted and sat promptly. It was a late dinner, about 8pm and the restaurant was pretty empty. 

The food... Well it was really just okay. Nothing over the top fabulous, but not terrible. I would highly recommend the lentil soup. It was hearty and delicious...Full of flavor! Please note to all my fellow vegans: THE HUMMUS IS NOT VEGAN. It contains Greek yogurt. Huge disappointment for me. I ordered the veggie skewer meal. It came with a small salad, rice, two small skewers, and about 3table spoons of tabbouleh. They were very accommodating and made sure everything that came out was prepared vegan. The skewers were cooked well and seasoned properly. However, they were mainly just red yellow and green peppers and two mushrooms on each skewer...Lacking vegetables and variety... 
The rice was okay, large portion. I left full with left overs, but not satisfied. 

The service was okay as well. She was pretty knowledgable about the food items which was a perk for me and my dietary needs. She did forget an entire meal for our table, but none of us really said anything since it didn't make the bill. The appetizer was enough for our friend. 

We ordered a bottle of the pomegranate wine. It was sweet and delicious. We finished it easily between the four of us. My boyfriend said his food was okay and my friends didn't take their left overs home... So I'm not sure if that meant it was bad or not. However, they do have a good happy hour I would check out, and for a fast quick semi healthy bite, it really wasn't all that bad. Use your yelp check in and get 20% off!"}
{"text":"went here for a late lunch with my mother the other day. she has never really ventured into greek food too much so i thought this would be a good choice. she loved it. we shared the greek trio platter so she could get a little taste of a few things. out of all three items we got i loved the pastitsio. i could taste the little hint of nutmeg and cinnamon. i couldnt taste too much eggplant in the mousaka though but it was very cheesy and i liked the sauce on it. we also shared the pumpkin baklava cheesecake. the portion size was huge. we ended up being able to take half of it home. (which was great because we both loved it.) very cripsy bottom with a hint of pumpkin. very rich and creamy. the servers were nice and helpful and i enjoyed being able to watch the cooks prepare our food. i will be coming back here for dinner soon."}
{"text":"This is the worst Gyro sandwich I have ever had and Greek Food is one of my favorites!! The meat lacked any flavor at all and the sauce was very bland.  Very disappointed and it was very expensive for a gyro sandwich!! The Gyros at Gyro Time tastes better then this place and that's not a good thing considering Gyro time is a fast food place!! Will not be going back! The people next to me had the lemon chicken and didn't finish their meal (more then half of the food was still on their plate and the whole time they were next to me waiting for their food they were complaining that they were starving and kept wondering what was taking so long for the food to come out). My Gyro Sandwich took 25 mins to come out!!"}
{"text":"As a former Chicagoan I consider myself to be quite the food critic.  We have an area in Chicago called Greektown and there were many really good Greek restaurants so coming here I didn't quite know what to expect.  This food was sooooo good and fresh!! I especially appreciated the friendly owner being present to ensure quality food and excellent service.  She was very attentive and made sure she acknowledged and greeted all of her customers.
I'll definitely be back here with my family."}
{"text":"Altogether a fabulous experience.  From the friendly and professional waitstaff to the beautiful atmosphere to the food, this is a great place to eat at - or takeout food.  I had the pumpkin mushroom soup (AMAZING!), pumpkin baklava cheesecake (pumpkin cheesecake with baklava chips on it and crust - OH MY!), the vegetable skewers and veg-a-nini (lots vegetables - great for vegetarians and vegans).  Also, the owner is always there and says hi, which is nice.  I can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"I had a Greek salad with chicken. It was alright. I lived in Chicago and was spoiled by Authentic Greek food in Greek Town and the taste of this can't compare. It's a little too generic.  No special Greek seasoning or flavors to it. The chicken breast seemed like your run of the mill frozen chicken breast from Costco or someplace. Even though it was grilled, it was a little on the tough side and flavorless. The search for the best Greek cuisine in Vegas continues..."}
{"text":"The food is excellent here. The service is great and the staff keeps you up with the status of your food and service. Definitely worth paying a little more than usual for Greek food. Worth a visit for great Greek food!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  The staff was friendly and the place was clean.  You order up front and take a number and then they bring your food to you.  We both had a cup of the pumpkin and mushroom soup which sounded odd but tasted very good.  I had the stuffed tomatoes. I have never had stuffed tomatoes before so I don't have anything to compare.  They were very good with a lot of pine nuts.  My friend had the Greek salad and he was impressed.  The coffee was terrible.  I'm not sure if it is flavored or if an employee had on too much perfume when they made the coffee. At any rate the food was wonderful and I will return and I may even sample the coffee one more time."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Not authentic though!!! They slapped on the Greek cuisine name mixed a bunch of stuff together. Greek and Italian do NOT mix. Get it together Market grille! You can't say it's Greek when it's not. Call it Italian."}
{"text":"Really great family-owned place! Lots of choices on the menu, salads, gyros, played and appetizers, etc. We ordered the chicken plate and gyro and the sauce was really good!! Our orders came with Greek salad, yum! We also ended the night with a slice of their Aphrodite's Cheesecake, which has a baklava crust- my new favorite dessert!"}
{"text":"Hidden away in a strip mall off the 95 is a Greek restaurant with such potential... unfortunately that's where the good part of this story ends. Let's begin the descent, shall we? It's dinner time and we're all very hungry. I order the Lamb Roast Cabernet, slow-roasted leg of lamb, complemented with a Cabernet reduction mushroom au jus sauce with a side of lemon herb roasted potatoes instead of rice; available upon request. My daughter ordered the Greek Trio, \"a selection of (their) most popular spanakopita, mousaka, and pastitsio\"; and my wife ordered Lamb Souvlaki, skewered cubes of lamb meat with rice. The bill came out to  $46 without the tip. So far so good? Yes, the service was very good. Malaysia our waitress was attentive, personal and knowledgeable about the menu. Gere is where the roller coaster ride begins its steep descent. The potatoes, skewered lamb and side dill dipping sauce were all terribly bland. The mousaka was fried and overcooked on the bottom, and not even a knife would cut through it. Too bad the kitchen doesn't rate as highly as its service, which in my experience is rare. My advice to management is that it's Greek food, so take some risks and spice it up a little. By the way, salt is not a spice. I'll may eat here again. I'd like to see if they change things up. BoN a Petite!"}
{"text":"The basil and spinach hummus is a must try! Service is wonderful and the patio is dog friendly and very nice! The gyros were delicious and the baklava was on point! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much that when I get married I'm having them cater! Does that tell you enough how much I LOVE their food? Lol"}
{"text":"We ordered Greek Trio. It was a Saturday at 11:30. Seemed like the trio was not so fresh. Maybe left over from day before? We ordered that our bread which comes with the meal be brought out with the separate salads we ordered but it didn't come out until the entrees were brought to the table."}
{"text":"Delicious food togo the filet skewers were awesome! I highly recommend chicken souvlaki plate with filet skewer on the side, Lemon avagolmeno (butchered that name)  soup, and please if you eat nothing else the pumpkin cheesecake.  Lawd, i would eat that cake at my wedding if I'd ever had another.  I may just divorce my husband and propose immediately, order the cake, and do this! Get some!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab some good ol Greek eats! I've been coming to this restaurant for s few years and haven't really been able to really explore much only because my regulars are soo darn tasty! 

The chicken pita is delicious, I always get it as a lunch special and that comes with a drink! I also love to get the Slovaki plates served with protein, rice, salad, and a choice of tatziki or hummus! The filet as well as the chicken are both solid options! The steak is always perfectly grilled as is the chicken! Until I ate here I'd never had any type of meat paired with grilled fruit and now it is my addiction! They also have a lemon soup that is just to die for! It isn't your normal soup full of broth! No sir, it's filled with chicken and rice, and packing a whole lot of lemon tangy goodness! Whenever I'm sick this stuff is liquid gold! 

Last, they have an infamous pumpkin cheesecake! 

Please take a moment of silence to drool! 

A pumpkin cheesecake that is not born of two pumpkin parents! No, I guess that would be boring given this baby's base is baklava!! Yessss! A two in one dessert that only gets better with the whipped cream piled high and the caramel sauce drizzling down! 

Why are you even reading anymore? I'm already on the 15 en route to get some cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Like I said in a previous post.. I compare all my greek to Stephano's and Market Grille Cafe just doesn't add up completely. Don't get me wrong the food is good and the desserts even better. But the food portion price combo just doesn't fit the bill... haha see what I did there."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat as a Family! Great food and great service. Now only if some of those chef specials would stay around a lot longer."}
{"text":"A wonderful family run restaurant! Loved our entire experience. From the very personable waiter (who took the time to share the story of the business), to the great fresh made food! Felt the \"culture\" of the restaurant was very generous and hospitable. We will certainly return!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the nicest experiences when you want Greek food. The pomegranate chicken, pastitsio, and rice pudding were wonderful.
I had never had the flaming cheese and brandy dish called saganake, but wow: this was outstanding!
The servers are very knowledgeable and quick, and I like the layout with plenty of space between parties. Parking is plentiful and there is music on Fridays and Saturdays. Somehow, with all this, it is easy to have a conversation.
For people who cannot tolerate gluten, they have basmati rice and other dishes which are available.
This is a great new discovery!!"}
{"text":"Best ever! I find myself making of finding reasons/errands to drive over in this area , Its about 40 minutes from where I live , I've tried various Mediterranean restaurants by my house and nothing compares. There hummus choices are phenomenal, my favorite is the spinach. Love the rice flavor ! the steak & chicken skewers are tender and very flavorful as well. Stuffed bel pepper are great too! Even the salad is perfect: feta cheese , olives, tomatoes ,cucumbers cut just right  really wish they would open one on the southwest side of town. Moved to southern highlands and there is not many restaurants close to here , would be amazing if they opened one here."}

{"text":"Food is always good and service is awesome.  Malaysia is super sweet and a great server!   I love the falafels avegolemono soup and pomegranate chicken."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious and the service was fast and friendly! One of the best restaurant experiences I've had in quite some time. I had the lunch special with the pomegranate chicken, mushroom and pumpkin soup, and some of my husband's Greek salad that came with his pastitsio entree. We really enjoyed everything! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'd really like to rate them 3.5 stars. I loved my simple vegetarian kabob dish, I don't know what seasonings they put on it but it was delicious!! It's pretty awesome that they have gluten free and vegetarian options, but I was disappointed because I told them gluten free and they still brought bread on my plate. Not good for me- as I have an allergy and it was touching part of my food. Also the hummus portion was tiny! I expected more. Overall my food, although simple, was really good. My husband had a gyro, and said it was good, but not the best he'd had."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of this place. It's not terrible but the chicken is dry every time I go and I am just not impressed with the food. So many other good restaurants in Las Vegas to choose from."}
{"text":"One of the best Greek food place I've ever tried. The only thing is that every time I go their filet kabob with rice plate tastes different. Almost as though they don't follow a recipe to the tee. Other than that the food is awesome. Food portion is perfect. They allow you to substitute items with no charge which is a huge plus. The filet kabob if ordered medium comes out tender. Rice, I'm not a fan off and that's because I grew up eating Japanese rice."}
{"text":"Never a bad meal, always terrific service!
Adding their fabulously marinated in secret sauce chicken, in the greek salad, is the way to go... soooo gooooood!"}
{"text":"Best time to go here is definitely lunchtime for their lunch specials.  Ask about it or check their posted menu for $8.50 each.  Their choices are nice quality menu items mix and match.

The big baby and I were able to fit in a lunch hour before she left for her first business trip since her promotion.  Really... the lunch menu choices we ordered were Pomegranate chicken with pumpkin mushroom soup, and Gyro wrap with lemon chicken soup.  No joke on price and quality.  One of the best $8.50 you'll spend.

Service was super friendly and welcoming especially our first time in.  And a pleasant experience indeed for our first visit.  The manager gave us a 15% coupon for the next visit.  But Yelpers don't forget to check in since that actually gives you 20% off.  Saving mine for later ;)

Interior is really pretty - gives you the feel of being in another country.  You know I love stuff like that!  There was a mini waterfall at the beverages bar.  The floor also had grapevine decorations; and look above!  Its like an outside vineyard lounge.

Location is on Lake Mead right of the freeway.  There's ample parking considering how busy the lot appears and a variety of other services nearby in the plaza... Cupcakes a few doors down.  Good location!  Get over there already for lunchy munchies!"}
{"text":"Service: after we were seated (immediately upon walking in) we were asked what we would like to drink, we told the guy all of your drink orders and he left. About 5 minutes later a server came by and asked us what our drink order was, confused we told the server our order. Well after about ten minutes or more my husband finally asks if we could get our drinks and if we could actually order. The server quickly too our food order with zero introduction of the restaurant (all the other tables received). Overall it seriously too way too long just to even get our drinks and finally our food. Again it seemed that no other tables had this issue.

Food: the food was delicious! The gyros were yummy along with the fries, it made a great lunch! I would love to get food there again, but I think I will be ordering take-out."}
{"text":"I have lived around the Mediterranean for a decade, so believe me when I say, this place has got the flavor of the region spot on! 

If you want to experience the flavor of that region in general, and Greece in particular, you will never go wrong here! Everything on their menu, is off the charts. The flavor is pure and as real as it gets. I order something different every time I visit (which is at least once a week), and then some.

The owners run their business very well, cook even better and mingle with their clients. Top marks for this family owned business!"}

{"text":"Great food, phenomenal service, and reasonable prices. Whenever I am in the Northwest I make an effort to stop in a eat here. The basmati rice is top notch."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Greek food! The Greek salads are amazing, the dressing is a lemony Greek and so so good. The gyros are amazing as are the desserts! I've tried quite a few things here and have been pleasantly surprised by how delicious each dish was."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place with great ambiance and fabulous mediteranian menu.  Cost is affordable and the food os always fresh.  My go-to is the gyro with a side of their fresh homemade soup.  I have tried most of the menu and have never been disapointed with taste, service and presentation!

A must!"}
{"text":"Salmon kabob the best thing on the menu. Other than the potato thingy with dipping sauce like dill pickles. So good.  Salads are great. Love the pumpkin cheesecake here too.  If this place was a sit down restaurant then I'd give it a 5."}
{"text":"10 million stars!!! What a little gem of a place! Finger lickin food, wonderful ambience, friendly wait staff, family-run establishment......what else does one want? Oh and did I mention the food was all kinds of heaven?! I had the Greek Trio entree.....it was beyond perfection. A sampler plate of moussaka, spanakopita and pastitso on a bed of fragrant basmati rice with salad, pita and humus. It's a good sized meal and I near stuffed myself! The hubby had a wrap which he said was ok, not enough meat. He 'helped' me with my trio ;) Our 5yr old had the pomegranate chicken with rice which he polished off with some butter. For dessert the hubby had canoli which was ok and I had the baklava cheesecake which was also ok. The owner Joe stopped by our table to say hello which was nice. Grandmother is the hostess.....very charming. Phillip from Texas was our server and he was super friendly. Only downside it's about 20 miles from homebut that's not gonna keep us away! Best Greek food in town hands down!"}
{"text":"GREAT MEDITERRANEAN FOOD!!!!!!  anything, ANYTHING i've gotten there has always been great!  Whether i call for pickup or eat there, great portions, lovely flavor.....all this talk of it i'm about to go NOW"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Market Grill Cafe for the last 4 years. I frequent their restaurant at least twice a week and 2 times a month on a weekend evening. The last 3 times i have had to send my food back, It is very frustrating to wait on my food when the everyone is eating and they have to then wait on me. I have asked mgmt if they have new cooks and they replied \"no we are just busy\". The food is also sub par, the hummus is thin and the dolmas are dry and hard to eat. Yesterday my bill came to $54.00, I put a $100.00 in the check folder and then left to do some quick grocery shopping at  Smiths Grocery in the same parking lot. I immediately realized I had not left a tip. I returned within 30 minutes to ask the girl for the check folder back and she denied I had left the $44.00 dollars. So basically they stole $44.00 of my money. I would of a left a very generous holiday tip but not $44.00. Mgmt was no help. They called the owner who also was no help. He basically didn't believe me. Is this the way to treat a patron who has continually spent around $250.00 a month over $44.00? This place has sub par food, a dishonest waitress and a restaurant that treats you this poorly ."}
{"text":"Simple and good food and very fair prices - love eating here."}
{"text":"Excellent food and freshly made. For appetizers we ordered Saganaki and Falafel. The Saganaki had brandy that was lit of fire as the waitress approached the table. It arrived with a side of freshly made flat bread. The Falafel was a little too minty for me but a hit for everyone else at the table. For the main meal my husband ordered the Greek trio and I the Keftedes (meatballs), both a la carte.  Very well prepared and favor full and the portions are huge! Needless to say, we were stuffed and had to take out leftovers home. 

Oh the service was inconsistent. While the ordering process and getting the food to the table was fast (only 5% of the restaurant was full), the follow-up on the drinks needed some improvement...or perhaps after a hiatus from American service and spending the Holidays from Germany, I had expected more?"}
{"text":"Love this place! It is my favorite restaurant in town :) food is delicious, friendly staff , and clean restaurant. I've tried a lot of different things from the menu and I have not been disappointed. Today I had a really bad experience at different restaurant and all my husband and I talked about on our way home was how we should have gone to market grill cafe. Where the food is always good, fresh, and we are never forgotten by anyone there. The service is great! Just wish the restaurant wasn't so far away but yeah that doesn't change the quality of the place."}
{"text":"You can eat vegan here while your friends eat lamb. Nice clean food. Nice atmosphere. The only problem for me is the nan bread has dairy and the hummus has dairy. Too bad otherwise 5 stars"}
{"text":"Love this place! The good is great as well as the people who work here. The food is amazing and I love that is sit down compared to the other location. I recommend to anyone who likes Greek food and even if you don't it's worth a try!"}
{"text":"The Mrs. had been hounding me for a while to try this place. That, coupled with a recommendation from my Yelp mentor and I found myself dining at the Market Grille Cafe. Great decision. The atmosphere was friendly with light music playing in the background. Our waitress, Nicole, was very helpful and friendly. She recommended the flaming cheese as an appetizer. Good call. Very unique and tasty. I opted for the Pomegranate Chicken as my entree. It was tender and juicy with plenty of flavor. The greek salad was fresh, the rice was cooked to perfection and the hummus and pita bread was a nice touch. The portion sizes left us stuffed, without room for dessert. Dinner for two with an appetizer was right around $45 including the tip. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! The Greek trio with the spinikopita muousska and the pastaitso was diversified in flavor and texture. Service was exceptional in quality. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was soooooo delicious!!! (Wow I feel horrible, I thought I posted this long ago, It was saved in my drafts.) just means I gotta go back soon! I love this place, they are so genuine, attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"This is another yummy Mediterranean spot they have the option of dine-in or take-out my favorite is the Greek Trio the ambience inside is super fun and the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"This place was delicious. I just moved here and when telling people where I moved they kept referring to the 'delicious Greek restaurant' so I figured I'd give it a try. The service was impeccable, the live music was perfect to listen to while still maintaining a calm ambiance, and the food was delicious. All for a great price! After my meal the owner even came and greeted me since it was my first time, made sure everything was up to standard, and gave me a 15% off coupon for my next visit! I had high expectations and all were exceeded. Definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, quick service, they do a 15% LVAC discount or a 10% military discount. The only things I didn't like we're the stuffed peppers and the wine. I had the Riesling spaltese and it tasted like cheap wine. The hummus and pita were my favorite part of the meal."}
{"text":"This place is OK.   I have had much better Greek and Mediterranean food here in town, but the location and the price will keep me coming back on a regular basis.  They regularly offer a 15% OFF coupon in the local VIEW newspaper, so keep an eye out.

i like that they have vegetarian and gluten free options.  This allows my entire family the chance to all agree on one place to eat out.  I like their hummus. Their falafel is/are excellent. Their lemon rice soup is very good, and so are their Greek fries.  Their Veginini is just OK, not quite worth what they're charging for it.  

Their traditional gyro is very interesting.  Their sauce is made with dill, not cucumber.  That's good, because I HATE cucumber.  But I love gyros so much, I will tolerate it in the gyro sauce.  Don't have to worry about that here.  Only problem with their gyro is that the meat is always very dry.  The only thing I can figure is that not enough people order the gyro, so the meat dries out on the rotisserie, maybe?  But hey, slather enough sauce on it, and everything's OK.  :)

They keep the place clean.  The staff are friendly (and busy!).  The line moves well, and the wait for your food is short.  It's sometimes tough to find a parking spot during lunch time, but that's due to a few other restaurants being in the same shopping center."}
{"text":"Changing to 1 star.  This place lost a customer over $7.00.   My wife has been frequently going to this place on her own before and after work for at least the last year and change. Last week, she went there and ordered a meal that included dessert for take out.  She didn't like the dessert and went back the next day and approached a server that helped her several times previously.  The server refused to take back the dessert and told my wife that if she wanted to get something else, there would be another charge!! On top of things, my wife had just placed another order for more food prior to bringing this dessert situation to their attention!  My wife swiftly told the server to cancel her order and said walked out.  We are talking about a $7.00 dessert that virtually costs the restaurant nothing.  Even if it costs $20, the restaurant, should have acknowledged the fact that my wife didn't like it, apologize, and offered a refund or an exchange since we are frequent customers.  We will definitely not be returning as a result."}
{"text":"This was a great find not too far from our house.  So far two gyros (lamb and traditional) have been tried, along with some babaganoush, baklava, and roasted red pepper hummus.  All were really quite good.  My only quibble was that the hummus wasn't quite as thick as I'm used too and the babganoush was a little thicker, but both tasted good, which is what really counts.  They warm pita triangles were quite nice though.  Our takeout look a bit longer than planned as well (they said 10 min and it was closer to 20), but I'm willing to wait for good food, and this was really good food.  We'll definitely be back to this place in the future."}
{"text":"Loved this fresh food in vegas my girlfriend took me to! The portions flavors and service are top notch a must visit in"}
{"text":"Service is quick and friendly. Food is delicious! Babaganoush, Traditional Gyro and Pomegranate Chicken!"}
{"text":"I'm a very happy yelped. Delicious, quick and great service. I ordered the chicken pomegranate gyro platter to go. I will for sure be coming again!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best greek restaraunts I have enjoyed. My wife and I had the gyros. They were excellent. Service was great....the staff was friendly and warm. They took the time to explain our questions about the menu. Also it being our first time they give you a gift to use on the next visit. Gotta come here and try it!"}
{"text":"FINALLY made it to Market Grille Cafe.  You place your order up front,  grab a number and choose your seating.  The menu is extensive,  something here for everybody. Vegetarian?  Check. Vegan?  Check. Confirmed meat eater?  Check.
Beer & wine served,  and they have the beverage island where you can get your cokes & diet concoctions.
My sweetie ordered a small gyro salad and I ordered a traditional gyro. Also an appetizer of stuffed (lamb, currants, rice, pinenuts, beef) grape leaves served warm with buttery lemon sauce, which was excellent !  The gyro salad & the traditional gyro were HUGE, and very flavorful. Great tasting,  perfectly seasoned.
Pricing very fair for what you get,  eating here will not break the bank. Our meall came to $27 + tip. 
Would I eat here again?  YES. Would I recommend?  YES. This food is \"\"home made \"\" .  The service staff was friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is casual . Dine in or take out. 5 stars.
This review is for the Lake Mead Bl location."}
{"text":"Great little place - I stopped in today to grab some to-go food to sustain my errand-running.  I was glad to find a place that was tasty, fast, and relatively healthy.  I wanted to rate this higher, but I did not care for the tabbouleh at all - it was really missing something (it kinda tasted like grass clippings with a squeeze of lemon).  I also had the pomegranate chicken wrap with \"dill sauce\" (wish they didn't dumb down tzatziki), which was quite delicious and really hit the spot.  Thumbs up for a military discount and super friendly staff.  I will probably try this place again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"We've eaten here three times now.

The baklava never seems to disappoint. I dream about it, and it's flaky, honey crust.

My hubby had a filet skewer entree and said it was overcooked, as was the basmati rice. 

I had the Pasta Giovanni, and it was divine. I wish it had more tomatoes and chicken in it, as most of the dish was just noodles.

I'm still excited to return and try other dishes. The quality just wasn't quite as high as our first visit."}
{"text":"Not great, but not bad. 

Lamb Souvlaki Gyro ($8.95): I ordered just the gyro, though, for $3.50 more you can get a side of rice, a Greek salad, and hummus and pita bread. I like how they provide the option of having either the traditional shaved meat or grilled meat. For my gyro I chose the shaved meat. The lamb was fine, but I thought it was under seasoned. On a future visit, I'd probably just stick with the traditional gyro consisting of both lamb and beef. 

Greek Trio Platter ($12.95): This was my boyfriend's order. The platter came with samplers of  Spanakopita, Mousaka, and Pastitsio. Plus, it came with rice, Greek salad, and slices of pita bread and hummus. The Spanakopita was the best with its flaky filo pastry and spinach and feta cheese layers. Our least favorite out of the three was the Pastitsio with its cinnamon and beef and tomato sauce combination. The Mousaka was just OK. 

The service was good. Our server was upbeat and knowledgeable about the menu, and she was enthusiastic about sharing her favorites and offering her suggestions.

Even though the food was OK, I'd visit again. They do have some menu items that sound tasty and interesting that I'd like to try, like the Pomegranate Chicken Spinach Salad, Pumpkin-Mushroom Soup, and their Pumpkin Baklava Cheesecake."}
{"text":"Blech. Worst. French. Fries. Ever.

Frozen, oversalted, pathetic potatoes who surely aspired to a better end than being served up here. 

Hummos? How can such a delightful thing lack so much flavor?

The whole place tastes like cheap ingredients.

If you want Mediterranean food, there are far better choices in Vegas. Their old (still current??) location wasn't bad, though it seemed overpriced.

Try Amena if you want similarly styled food with extra helpings of tasty!"}
{"text":"Everything on their menu is fantastic. Growing up with Middle Eastern/ Mediterranean  food finding a place that comes even remotely close to home made is very rare but they have most definitely succeeded. Anyone looking for Greek Food this is the place to go their prices are reasonable and the staff is always friendly and takes care of you."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a good Mediterranean restaurant since our move to Las Vegas 2 years ago. I think we've found it!  Can't find the noodle casserole in the fast food gyros places and that's what I love, but found a delicious casserole here. 
My husband likes gyros and found the meat on this one a little dry. The prices were good, the service excellent, the atmosphere was that of a fancy dinner restaurant.  The menu had Italian meals, also. Something we'll try next visit!"}
{"text":"This was a great dining experience. The prices were reasonable and the food was delicous and generous especially the lunch specials. The pumpkin mushroom soup was heavenly and Im not typically a soup person. Cant wait to go back and try the Baklava it looks AMAZING!! The owner was savvy enough as to inquire about our dining experience thats what every smart entrepreneur should do. My son is moving here soon for a residency program and Im so grateful that delicious, healthy food is so local. Oh, forgot to mention the staff was fantastic as well, very patient with a newby like me and just nice overall. FYI...I only take the time to write really GREAT reviews or really poor ones. This place is worthy of your consideration!"}
{"text":"The gyros are to die for. And the pita and hummus is out of this world. If you do carry out the orders are always ready quickly usually in under 10 minutes. The staff is always so nice and polite and always ask if you need anything extra with your order. Definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Went in to have a sit down lunch and seen the sign saying \"please wait to be seated\" after 5 minutes of standing there and being seen by multiple employees one finally came up and said its free seating wherever you wanted to sit. I then pointed out the sign to her she switched it around and gave no other acknowledgment. The ONLY time the waiter came to the table was to deliver the food and was never seen again. The food on the other hand was FANTASTIC and I will definitely eat here again but I'll take it to go."}
{"text":"We eat here a lot and have never had a complaint. My son loves the \"flaming cheese\". Great atmosphere and great customer service"}
{"text":"A hidden busy little gem. My fries were seasoned !  Who does that anymore!  Delish!  The food was good, prices were great, downfall was a very long wait from order to food. 

Clean-cute decore & I would go back."}
{"text":"My family ate here Sunday 11/5 for a late lunch. We ordered the Saganaki and it was very good. I ordered the Greek Trio. I've ordered this at several different Greek restaurants and this one was really good. I'd come back again for sure."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find this location since the one on lakemead and rock spring is to far from me. Unfortunately I will never return to this Market grill. We went in on a Saturday evening. The service was HORRIBLE! It's the absolute worse service I've ever had in a restaurant. They sat us down, server didn't get to our table until about 10 min after. Ordered our drinks and it took another 10 min to bring me a water my boyfriend ordered a chi tea and after another 5 min they told him the machine was broken. Okay it's fine we get it so we let it slide. Fast forward to an hour later still haven't gotten our food. I'm hangry at this point. No salad, no soup no acknowledgement from the server. Finally I said something and she brought us our lentil soup, still no side salad. Long story short we ended up getting our salad after we got our gyro. We are big on service so no I will never return. I will drive an extra 10 miles to the other location because we do love the food. 2 stars only because the food is amazing."}
{"text":"They make the best hummus.....simply the best.   Everything on their menu is gold!  Stop in here and see for yourself! The service, the atmosphere....you just can't beat it.  If you work in the area....any of their salads make for a great light lunch.  Definitely a jewel of Centennial Hills."}
{"text":"Market grille cafe always serves fresh ingredients and they have a staff who are always friendly. You Must try their Pomegranate Chicken! Plus all of their desserts are delicious."}
{"text":"Good, fast, decent priced Greek food. I haven't been anywhere else but Stephano's for Greek food so I was excited to try something new. 

I tried the traditional hummus, pomegranate chicken with basmati rice (lunch special), and Aphrodite's cheesecake. I thought everything was really good! The hummus was good and they serve it with warm pita bread. It was super lemony lol, but yummy. The pomegranate chicken was super good! It was sweet and savory and grilled just right. The cheesecake was good but very heavy and rich in flavor. The baklava crust was yummy too. 

I'd come back again, mostly for the pomegranate chicken haha. Service was also on point! We still received a lot of attention even when we were the only people on the patio."}
{"text":"Market Grille Cafe is a great place to grab some food to go, dine inside or even hold a party in their banquet area. There's a good amount of dining space with tables as well booths and there's also a spacious patio if eating outside is your thing. You can also place a phone order and use the door on the side of the building with a sign designated for pick up orders. I do recommend placing your order ahead of time instead of walking in to order because they get busy around dinner and it helps avoid a longer wait time. I have ordered before and showed up 5 minutes after they said it would be ready and still waited like 10 minutes. The staff is friendly and servers have been good about checking my table for refills while dining inside and I also appreciate how when I arrive to pick up a phone order that they go over everything to make sure it's all correct and that it's all there. 

Pomegranate Chicken Mediterranean Wrap ($9.50) - Pomegranate chicken, lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, red cabbage, basmati rice, feta cheese with your choice of sauce (hummus or yogurt dill) and tortilla (flour, wheat and spinach-basil). I asked for extra yogurt dill (extra .50 cents) and spinach-basil for the tortilla. I really like the flavor of the pomegranate chicken and veggies together and the yogurt dill sauce is good. The wrap is huge I usually only eat half and save the rest for later. All wraps include a side Greek salad. The salad tastes fresh, but not the best I have had.

They have a lunch special from 11:30 am - 3 pm that's currently $8.50. You can choose from a gyro, pomegranate chicken, wrap or skewer and you also get to choose from platos potatoes (seasoned fries), salad, basmati rice or soup. The lunch special also includes a drink. Not a bad deal at all. The seasoned fries are really good and the dipping sauce that comes with them tastes good."}
{"text":"This place gets four stars for having a dessert that incorporates three of my favorite things... Pumpkin Pie, Baklava and Cheesecake. AH-MAY-ZING!!!

I have to admit that I am a dimwit when it comes to Greek food. I can't tell the difference between what is authentic and what is commercialized. I do, however, know good food, and Market Grille fits the bill.

My husband ordered the Pomegranate Chicken Gyro and I got the Traditional Gyro. We both liked the Pomegranate Chicken one better but both meats were tender and delicious. The pita bread was warm and toasty.

I wish I had ordered more food to try. I would like to try the Gyro Pizza or some other authentic Greek items that I cannot pronounce. 

The restaurant is huge and looks like a good place for large gatherings. There is a nice patio area where you can dine. The service was quick, friendly and efficient.

If anything, definitely go here for the Pumpkin Baklava Cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Holy wow! The best Greek food I've had in Las Vegas. They brought out this flaming cheese...I forget the name but you must get it! The staff is friendly and efficient. This is definitely one of my new favorites."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go to when I am in the area!  The staff is always friendly and helpful!  The food is delicious!  I wish they had one in the southwest area!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today and fell in love. 
Not only is the service wonderful- but the food is awesome!  I had the traditional gyro and fries... Delish!!! 
I highly recommend getting the tomato basil hummus!! Absolutely to die for!! 
I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I really, really like this place. Ordered a greek salad with gyro and a side of yogurt dill (tzatziki in the greek world). Food was brought out promptly. Really delicious. 
Wine and beer are available and they also have a happy hour, too.
Very friendly servers and cashiers."}
{"text":"Order up pay and then go grab a seat.  I would recommend the Lamb and some of the others had the pomegranate chicken that got great reviews and also the pumpkin soup.  Some of the other reviewers mentioned the tartness of the hummus, I agree and it was a little runny for hummus.  But the lamb was good, I would recommend the easy style and the food"}
{"text":"I ordered take out. I had the gyro meat Mediterranean wrap with flour tortilla and a yogurt dill sauce. It comes with a Greek salad. It tasted delicious. I love that rice is inside of the wrap. I also ordered a side of warm pita bread with hummus. That was the best and my favorite part of my meal. It was enough to share with two people. I was craving baklava but i was disappointed with the one I had. I have tasted better baklava in the past. It was not satisfying. The service was quick, friendly, and great."}
{"text":"I've been going to Market Grille for a few years now so I don't know why I haven't written a review yet.  The one on Lake Mead is now closest to me and great for stopping in for either a quick bite or to grab a to-go box.  They have great salads, gyros, fries, and the pumpkin soup is one of my favorites.  If you have room the pumpkin baklava cheesecake is really good but rich.  If you want something sweet but a little lighter the rice pudding is always spot on.

I also like that they offer gluten free, a vegetarian, and vegan dishes so that just about anyone can find something great.  Now that they're doing a happy hour, I may need to stop in more often.  Oh! Make sure to check in and you'll get a coupon.  I'll just save mine until next time which shouldn't be too long."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time  we had eaten here. Food was great servers  were nice and helpful. We will be going back. This is a must try"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick afternoon bite, and ended up enjoying one of the best meals I've ever had. 
The pomegranate chicken is phenomenal; the gyro meat is the best I've ever tasted. 
Everything is made in-house, and it shows. 
The kitchen is spotless. The bathrooms are, too. 
We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. They were very nice and cared about my good allergy and made sure everything was to our liking. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is good, but its almost like a fast food version of Mediterranean cuisine. You order at the counter and your food is dropped off by the hostess.

It's located across the street from In'N Out. 

Parking can be a little tight at busy times."}
{"text":"Came here on the way to the Gilcrease Sanctuary. (2 min. drive from here)
I had a pretty good experience here.
We were seated in the booth right away at 1pm on a Sunday. Nice. The hostess was so cheerful and friendly.
I ordered $8.50 lunch special. A huge gyro with Greek salad with ice tea. What a deal!!
The salad was so fresh. The gyro was nice and warm. The meat inside was tasty with Greek spices. It was so huge I couldn't finish it.
I also tasted their hummus trio. It was a sampler of three different flavored hummus. Spinach Basil, Roasted red pepper and Lemon cilantro. They were different than any of the hummus I've had before. I enjoyed each one of them. 
The service was nice and quick. The waitress was very friendly. 
Great lunch spot on your way to Gilcrease Sanctuary :-)"}
{"text":"First time here and the food was amazing. Just had the Mediterranean Medley appetizer and the traditional gyro platter with yogurt dill sauce. Very authentic and portions were plentiful. I was full so I bought the baklava to go.. Will definitely come back and try something else on the menu.. OPA!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this place a perfect \"10!\" My BF and I were in Vegas for his birthday. We stopped by to visit friends in Summerlin. They recommended we try Market Grill. We are so grateful that they did. 

From the moment we were seated (there was no wait), Raymond, our awesome server, greeted us with a superb introduction to this little family owned restaurant. He was prompt with our order and made fantastic recommendations. We had the Saganaki appetizer, the Avgolemono soup, the Pomegranate Chicken, the Greek Trio, and took home a big slice of pumpkin cheesecake for later. Everything, even the side dish of rice and hummus, was spectacular.

We had so much food, that we took our left overs and dessert back to our friends. The minute we shared our experience, the leftovers began to disappear.

Thank you to Raymond and the Market Grill for making our visit even that much more memorable!! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit with my Adult Coloring Group. Each time my meals were delicious, service was attentive and the staff and owner so welcoming! We enjoyed it so much the first time we went back! Next time we go It will be difficult to decide whether to try a different entree because I am still thinking about the Pomegranate Chicken I had tonight. There wasn't even a morsel of rice left on my plate! Thank you ladies for making it an enjoyable evening! We'll see you next time. OPA!"}
{"text":"I went to lunch here with my dad recently. We were seated immediately. The service was great. I have three stars because I had the signature pomegranate chicken salad and was not impressed. My dad had a separate salad that was also mediocre. I will probably choose a different lunch place next time."}
{"text":"If you want a great gyro then definitely come here! The service was fast and friendly. I got the traditional gyro plater with the extra sides and it was so much food I couldn't finish it. The place was clean and the atmosphere was very comfortable. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I come here every week for the Pasta Angelo - Go big with double chicken. Gyro's are great. The hummus sampler is goooood too. Trust me on this one. :))"}
{"text":"This 5 star rating trend is seriously giving off the impression that I \"like\" or \"love\" everything I consume.  Not true, and I can be brutally honest when needs be.  I just so happen to be frequenting some really delish joints as of late.  Love the ambiance of Market Grille Cafe.  Not too hoity-toity, yet not ultra casual either.  The woman taking my order was engaging and I asked her why the business had not ventured to the other side of town.  She reassured me that there was something in the works (hold tight East-siders!).  I ordered the Lunch Special Traditional Gyro which comes with a bottle of water or fountain drink for $7.50.  I never thought I would experience a gyro which was comparable to the gyros in my college town.  Call it college town elitism, but their gyros were seriously sensational.  I think those gyros have finally met their match.  The lamb meat mixture at Market Grille wasn't overly salty which I have found to be the case at Gyro Time.  The tzatziki sauce, oh the tzatziki sauce (they don't actually refer to their sauce as tzatziki but rather yogurt dill), was perfectly seasoned, just the right amount of dill as to not overpower the flavor of the lamb.  The gyro featured vegetables such as onions, cucumber, and lettuce.  They don't skimp on the meat and one gyro is enough for lunch.  I appreciated the less than 10 minute wait for my food considering how ravenous I was.  Can't wait for them to open a restaurant closer to home.  Thanks for a great meal!    

Bonus: The Cupcakery is just a few stores down.  In my opinion, a Southern Bell cupcake is the perfect way to finish up any meal."}
{"text":"Our server was amazing, we ordered; (on a scale from 1-10)
The humans trio was delicious, (8)
The Avo soup is a lemony chicken soup (9) 
The Tabouli was freshly made (9)
The Pasta Stefano with chicken (10)

If you want homemade Greek food, this is the place
to go.
Average plate is $10, great portions."}
{"text":"Love the food. Pomegranate chicken is a popular one with our family. My personal favorite is the veggie wrap in a spinach tortilla."}
{"text":"They have a separate menu for dietary restrictions- vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free. I was really surprised by the lack of options for a place that advertises gluten free and veg options. It would have been nice for them to mark every menu item being GF and/or veg, but instead I had to cross compare them on the different sections. I was pretty disappointed that the hummus, falafal and baba ganoush weren't vegan (and so was my vegan kid who really wanted some hummus). 

I ended up getting veggie skewers in a meal served over rice and with a Greek salad, hummus, and cucumber slices. The veggies were really great, actually, but the portions were pretty small for the price.

The restaurant itself was clean, nicely decorated, and great artwork on the walls. It's a bit out of the way while driving through Vegas, but still conviently off the 95. There are so many places to eat in Vegas that we'll probably not go out of our way to eat there again, but I would consider it if we are in the area."}
{"text":"No complaints, all delicious B) Service was great as well. I'll come back whenever I have more money"}
{"text":"Not authentic Greek or Mediterranean.

No WiFi so they are out for lunches, and some dinners.

The food is just ok, they will do if don't have time to go somewhere where you can get real Greek and friendly service. I hate it that the mad Greek is no longer close. 

I have tried a few things on the menu all are decent not worth sending back, but yet not worth writing home about."}
{"text":"I love the chicken and veggie kabobs w the Greek salad! Amazing!! Always fresh and yummy! Usually the service is pretty good but the last few times it has taken over 30 min to get our food. If you are on your lunch, be mindful of this. Also...try the pumpkin cheesecake- another fabulous treat!!!!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, best Greek in Vegas.  Fresh, light and tasty,  they really take time to season the food.  Filet Kabobs cooked to perfection and cheesy saganaki.  Oh my, it was decadent"}
{"text":"Meh, it's okay. If you're looking for tasty gyro meat, head to Yassou or Baladie. The meat at Market Grille had a strange texture and reminded me of the meatballs I had from the hospital cafeteria. 

I would also say the tzaziki sauce is 100x better at Yassou and Baladie as well. 

My husband had the pomegranate chicken platter at Market Grille and he really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Best meal ever! My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time, and we so happened to make it in tonight! Perfect timing because I was hungry! I had the pomegranate chicken entree, and my husband had the lamb. Everything was absolutely delicious from our Greek salads, to our entrees, and to our dessert! We shared a slice of Aphrodite's cheesecake and it was a great size for two, especially after inhaling our dinner! Next time I want my own slice though because it was seriously that delicious! They also have a tiramisu cheesecake I want to try on our next visit, which will be in the near future!!!! Thank you so much for the amazing food and fantastic service!!! This is my new favorite place, and I could literally kick myself for not coming in sooner!!!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, but service was horrible, 45 min wait for a wrap and one gyro... table that came in after us were served their food before us."}
{"text":"I had the lamb gyro pita.  Been to many greek restaurants and this was better than most.  Bread was fresh and meat was tasty.  Veggies were also fresh."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!  Can't wait to go back. My husband and I each enjoyed a lunch special.  The portions were ample and very tasty.   It will be one of our go to places for happy hour 4 to 6 Sunday through Thursday, so we can try many of their special menu items."}
{"text":"Having visited again, I'm kicking this review up a notch to 4 stars. While at my Vegas house for a girls weekend, we stopped and picked up a ton of appetizers take-out. They have a separate take-out entrance on the side of the building. As with the sit-down restaurant, the staff was wonderful. Very friendly, helpful & patient. 

The falafel is seriously the best I have ever had. Better than anything I had in Greece! I actually regret trying this because now no other falafel will compare. I stopped at the Mad Greek on the way back to Vegas and just as I suspected...not nearly as good. And it's normally not bad! 

We had a large order (there were 8 of us) and they checked each bag in front of us to ensure we got all the correct food. We got several orders of:
Falafel - Absolutely delicious. 
Hummus trio - Great. 
Satziki - Very nice. 
Fried Cheese - It's not called that but that's what it was. I didn't care for it but almost everyone else did. 

I look forward to eating at Market Grille Cafe when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"I had a fairly good experience at the restaurant. I had the Greek Trio and all three of the dishes were good. A bit of it was slightly overcooked but it tasted good.  The hummus was bad. It had very little flavor except for a very strong raw garlic after taste. It was not pleasant but other than that the food was fresh and the flavors were good."}
{"text":"Talk about shitty service. First of all we're in a Greek restaurant. Why does the server feel like needs to speak Spanish to us. A little racist! Server does not know how to talk to customers. Were your customers not your friends. Finally walked out after 40 minutes of not getting our food."}
{"text":"Love this place!
They have the best Greek food around! 
The chicken gyro platter tastes great & so healthy too."}
{"text":"I always enjoy a good Mediterranean restaurant and this one does not disappoint.  Family owned and operated and the food has been consistently good.  A tad bit pricey but I feel it is worth it"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Have done take out several times as well as dine in. You get a ton of food for a reasonable price. Pomegranate chicken is delicious and flavorful; hummus is spot on and Greek salad dressing is like nothing I've tasted before. Check this place out! Only downside is the Lake Mead location is closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Market Grille! We always have had a positive experience when we go there. 
It was nice to see the owner, visiting with the patrons. 
The pumpkin cheesecake (not sure what they call it), was so good. Our server was very attentive, and the restrooms were well kept. 
I would recommend Market Grille Café, to all of my family and friends."}
{"text":"My favorite Greek restaurant in town. Good service. Great food. Pomegranate chicken gyros for the win!"}
{"text":"I love dolmades but the dolmades here are huge and tough.. the grape leaves are way too big but the filling is good. 

They have three flavors of fresh brewed iced tea but only one brew basket and all the flavors mix together resulting is disgusting regular iced tea. 


Gyro's are good, Plato's potatoes are tasty. Falafel is good but dark, on the overdone side. 

Staff was super friendly, bathroom is clean."}
{"text":"What a delight this is!  We arrived about 5:30 on a Saturday and were virtually the first customers in - that changed rapidly as time went by!  There were lots of pick-up orders while we were waiting, but the dine-in area didn't fill up until 6:15 or so.  Initial service was prompt, taking our order was a little slow, but once placed the wine, beer and food came quickly.

The saganaki came, was flamed tableside and is delicious!  Our granddaughter had never had it before and, like us, loved it!  The rosemary-olive oil pita bread is to die for, crisp and flavorful, and is a recommended side dish. We had a veggie falafel wrap, a chicken gyro and a gyro meat gyro - all were excellent.

The staff were friendly and attentive after the initial pause in service, and I felt the price point was fair, the portions large.  While I prefer the in-house baked pita at Khoury's, overall I recommend Market Grill highly."}
{"text":"Iam not a greed food fan, but GF is. When I tried the food I was hooked, go just once and you will love it. been back 4 times in 3 months already."}
{"text":"Pretty good I have to say. I got the Greek Trio. The best was the spanakopita followed by the moussaka and then the pastitio (or whatever it is) I didn't finish that because it tasted kinda weird. (Not to my palettes liking...not like get food poisoning weird). The basmati rice-delicious. I also got the pumpkin yia yia cookies. Which they forgot to give me. The ordering process is quite off putting and prices are a bit ambitious for what you get."}
{"text":"I really love this place, in part because its so close to my house.  But the other reason is that their menu is full of healthy food options, and also tastes very good.  I have had amazingly fantastic home made Greek food, and to be quite honest, nothing compares to that.  However, if you are looking for a sit down restaurant with very good Mediterranean food, this is the spot.  

It also has a friendly neighborhood atmosphere with very nice employees.  The price is definitely fair, and as it happens if you are an LVAC member you get a 20% discount.  Which works quite well, because as I said, they have some good healthy home made style options, that are really quite fresh tasting.  Of course, just like any similar restaurant they have all of the high calorie options too, but even those taste like they use very high quality ingredients."}
{"text":"One of my family's favorite restaurants for Mediterranean Food in Vegas.  We used to live nearby, so now when we visit we have to drop by and have one of our fav's.  It's cheap, convenient, and fast.  We enjoy these dishes:

Greek Salad, $5.95
Combo Platter Appetizer (Hummus, Tabouli, Babaganoush, Greek Salad, Dolmades, Falafel), $10.95
Spanakopita, $8.25
Traditional Gyro, $7.75

All of the food is very good and authentic.  This place can get very busy during peak lunch and dinner hours.  We like to go later than normal so we can find a seat and enjoy our meal.  It's also great to order it to go if you don't feel like dining in.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"I learned to eat Greek Food in Wicker Park. Greek Town in Chicago is only surpassed by the food in Greece. I travel extensively for business and have had Greek food all over the world.  I am delighted that we have found a great Greek diner in Las Vegas. 
The service was great. The Saganki was very good. A little different, but super flavorful. The pita bread tastes fresh and homemade. The gyro was tasty. Tsatsiki was tangy and chock full of cucumber. The vegetables were fresh and the Pumpkin cheesecake superb. 
We will go back and I can't wait to try the pomegranate chicken. 
Tried the Pomegranate Chicken last time and I am back to the Gyro platter. It was good don't get me wrong. I just need a Gyro occasionally. We missed happy hour.  The appetizers are fab and cheap. Monday is wine half price bottle of wine!"}
{"text":"Really good Greek spot in the Centennial Hills area. This place is a homemade cooking gem and when you come here you must get the Pomegranate Chicken. It is perfectly marinated in pomegranate and despite being grilled the chicken remains juicy thanks to the juicy topping. The rice is cooked really well where it is soft but not mushy and the pita is solid."}
{"text":"Oh, Market Grille. I've liked this place for a while, but a few things about the setup make it weird. As you enter, there's a nicely decorated dining room right in front of you, but huge menus to the left and a cashier. Sometimes a person will immediately ask to seat you for standard dine-in service where you pay at the end. Other times, I've gone all the way through the line, paid, then seated myself.

The temperature in here is always either too hot or abnormally cold. Last time was the latter. Caught a funky smell near the drink machines one day too, which kinda threw me.

The good part is the food. Slightly above average mediterranean with decent bang for the buck. Nice daily specials, too. I'm a fan of the chicken kotanini and pumpkin cheesecake, but opted for the chicken skewer this time. Very filling with the salad, veggies, rice, hummus, and pita.

If these guys can fine-tune the dining room experience and put a little more \"umph\" behind their \"OPA!\", they might be winning."}
{"text":"I thought it was ok. Food was a bit bland for my liking but the ambiance and service were excellent. Salmon didn't taste fresh but rather seemed like it was frozen. Hummus was quite good."}
{"text":"I am I big fan of Greek food and this place is absolutely delicious!! I found it one night when I was craving some Greek food. It's right around the corner from my house. I always get the Lentil soup it's super yummy and fills you right up. I've also had the traditional gyro (my husband really like it and he's hard to please when it comes to food). Greek salad and their hummus are also very tasty. And they have some nice vegetarian options.
They are surprisingly quick for take out (as you can dine in or take out) and always very nice."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food, it's probably one of my favorite cuisines. I had this place bookmarked forever, but I never get up to this area, so after a hike at Mt. Charleston, it was the perfect time to stop in. 

I was craving kabob and a Greek salad, I couldn't decide which to order, salmon or filet kabob, our waitress explained that I could order one of each and it would be the same price as the entree, which was $12.95. I went with that. 

I receive my salad first, it had good flavor and all my favorites in a typical Greek salad. My entree comes out. I taste the basmati rice, bland, no flavor. I moved onto the hummus & pita. The hummus was ok, but my pita was basically store bought pita bread sliced into triangles. Another let down. So then I try the salmon, it was so dry and Inedible. Last thing, the filet kabob, again no flavor at all. I NEVER salt my food, this needed it terribly, I ended up using the hot sauce on the table to give it some flavor. 

When the bill comes, I notice she charges me $12.95 plus $6.95 for a \"side\" kabob. This is not how she explained this to me. This meal was terrible and not worth $5, let alone $20.

Calling this place a Greek restaurant is like calling Carrabba's Italian food. Never again."}
{"text":"skewers are always the best! love their basmati rice! its not just plain but flavorful!   we always pick the one in Durango... ample seating!!!"}
{"text":"Was still trying to kick my Chinese craving, but the wifey doesn't like Chinese so she suggested this place. Was a nice looking dining room and seemed like a good atmosphere, however we got our meal to-go. We ordered a felafel appetizer, stuffed green peppers and grilled chicken breast with some sort of glaze, pomegranate I think. The felafel were a nice size, but too dry and too spicy. The stuffed peppers didn't look too nice, but we did get it to-go. Didn't taste too bad, and the bed of rice it came with was pretty good. Came with a small salad as well that had a tasty balsamic vinaigrette. Downside is the side of dressing was in a thimble-sized cup. I didn't know they made sauce cups that small. The chicken was interesting. At first it tasted like Chinese BBQ, but then an overly sweet taste kicked in. Still not sure how much I liked it. It WAS different. Should have just got a gyro(jirow. Not geerow or eerow dammit!). I will get that next time cause I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great local place to eat with fair prices. My wife and I frequent this place and it has never let us down... I like their hummus and I don't even eat hummus haha"}
{"text":"This is the perfect lunch spot.  They frequently offer deals for yelp check-ins or online discount offers.  There are plenty of menu choices, so there is enough variety to satisfy more selective palates.  Items range from soup, salad, gyros, skewers, hummus, chicken, lamb, salmon, even some vegetarian options.  If you opt for the entree, it includes pita bread, rice, and salad.

Their venue is a former Pei Wei, and the setup didn't change.  You order at the counter and they deliver the food with self serve beverages."}
{"text":"I like to come here after hiking in mount Charleston. It satisfies me enough, but doesn't make me feel like having a heart attack.

They have a really good lunch menu. They have a couple of different options for an entree, you get a side, and drink.

I chose to get the chicken gyro, one of my friends got the original, and my other friend chose the pomegranate chicken. 

I really liked the chicken. I was surprised by how big it was. I got it with the yogurt sauce. The chicken was really well cooked. My friend loved the pomegranate if you want something a little different. It was so satisfying. The whole meal like just $9 I think for the lunch option each, which is a really good deal.

The staff takes you through the really popular items on the menu if you haven't been there before. You also get a 15% off for your next boost if it's your first time."}
{"text":"I am a fan, yes. Healthy eating is always a plus. They have fresh and colorful Greek salads! The meat is juicy and flavorful too. I am a huge wine fine and love their happy hours with wine and appetizers discounted. I have been about ten times now and seem to notice that they loose servers. other than that its a nice place!"}
{"text":"Incredible food! We ordered the lunch menu for pick up. Pomegranate chicken with basmati rice and traditional gyro with fries.... large soft drinks were included. All fresh and delicious! My husband and I were very impressed and definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"1st time time, food is gr8! Service is friendly, lots of seating very nice atmosphere. I need to come back so much great food items n the dessert looks so good! N unique from other places, definitely b back with more ppl!"}
{"text":"Place was excellent! Great service, really good food, first time here and can't wait to go back. Had a nice chat with the owner, she's very sweet and works out on the floor helping her employees and doesn't mind getting to work! Love owners like that. They even have $5 gyros after 9pm! Make sure you stop by to check this place out! You won't regret it! Keep up the great work market grille!"}
{"text":"I am sitting in the Market Grille Cafe eating lunch and wondering why this establishment is not over run with customers.  The Greek cuisine is delicious, the people are warm, courteous and professional and the prices are crazy cheap!  My gyro and greek salad and drink ($8.50!!!) are amazing.  If you check in on yelp you will get 20% off!!  Ask for their fantastic manager, Maria!

{"text":"Fresh Fast and Fun,
Food good , I had  mousakka and my husband had Gyro and we enjoyed the taste and the freshness.

Coupon for free drinks ( wine) was a plus.

Service in a \"semi-fast food \" place was refreshing.

Aphrodite cheese cake as MARVELOUS.  We will go again!"}
{"text":"Such a sweet place in a busy, shopping-filled location! Stopped by since I was in the area on a Saturday, early afternoon. There were only a few people, so we got a table right away! The staff here is so friendly and really makes sure you are comfortable and enjoying your food. I really appreciated our waiter explaining the whole menu and giving us some recommendations. I'm a sucker for some tasty hummus.. and this place did not disappoint, I even took some to go! If you want some delicious Greek food, traditional or with an American twist, head over :)"}
{"text":"It's good, but not amazing.

I wandered into this restaurant after seeing their sign on my way to chipotle. I figured I eat at chipotle enough, so maybe I should try something new.

The first thing that struck me was the prices. I really wanted to spring for a kebab meal, but instead i went for their more economical lunch special. For 7.50 you can get your choice of traditional or chicken gyro, pomegranate chicken salad, or falafel appetizer with a soda. I sprung for the traditional gyro and soda.

It was pretty good. The meat was yummy, but wasn't browned at all. It was as if they sliced it right off the spit and put it on my pita. Still good though. I loved their hummus  and their pitas were very tasty and fresh as well.

Service was friendly too. A+ for the people working there!

Overall, I had a good experience. I can't say I was wowed though. I've definitely had much better mediterranean food, but if you're looking for quick lunch at an economical price, i would suggest this place."}
{"text":"Always great service and food!! To bad they moved far enough north I can't stop in as much as I use too. The traditional Greek food is the best plus the healthy options are just as good"}
{"text":"Market Grille is always a good choice. Whether you're looking for a quick lunch, date night, or takeout it can always please. Has gluten free options but make sure you mention an allergy to your server even if it says it's gluten free on the menu. Great place, awesome food."}
{"text":"Three of us came here recently after dinner plans at a nearby restaurant fell through.  We had the following:

Small plain hummus served with pita
Small babaganoush with pita
Side falafel
Side gyro meat with pita bread
Greek trio à la carte
Baklava
Rice pudding

The hummus was good but was surpassed by the babaganoush.  I liked the thickness of the babaganoush.  I thought the pita was mediocre.

The side of gyro meat was my other favorite of the night--not counting dessert.  There was a $.50 charge for the pita that we ordered with the meat.  The  meat was tender and flavored nicely.  The Greek trio was good with the mousaka being the stand out.

Both desserts were very good.  I liked that the baklava was not drenched in honey and nuts as many places do and the rice pudding was quite good.  Prices were good for the meal."}
{"text":"Sorry, but that other reviewer was wrong. We had dinner for 2 for $27.00 (they have a coupon for 2 free glasses of house wine on their website). If you think this is expensive then stay away from Paymon's (A single gyro, no platter was over 10 dollars)

I had Gyros platter, the gyro was Nice sized and the meat was cut off the vertical spit (not frozen gyros \"patties\"). the platter includes a nice sized Greek salad with tangy homemade Greek dressing and some seasoned rice and humus and pita ( I liked the humus with yogurt, then it's not the consistency of kindergarten paste).

This pita bread is about as good as you get in Las Vegas. 

My resident grape leaf tester (my wife, who orders them wherever she can) got the vegetarian variety and enjoyed them very much along with her Moussaka which was rich and not greasy.

I will be adding this place to our visit often list based on the good food, and service and value."}
{"text":"My overall 1st time experience was absolutely awesome! Our server Jessica had an amazing aura and was very detailed in explaining the menu and giving us a brief history of the cafe, excellent service! The food was all so tasty (we even heard another table say aloud it was \"Scrumptious!\") started with the Blackberry Jasmine Iced Tea (highly recommend!) and a Spanish basil hummus, then I ordered the Greek Trio which was a great way to get a little taste of some of the amazing dishes they offer.  Can't forget to give a shoutout to Moe for stopping by to make sure we had a good first time before leaving. Thanks Guys! You killed it :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The grape rolls are so yummy . The pomegranate chicken is life changing ! And the pumpkin cheesecake is worth the drive !"}
{"text":"I was on a mission to deliver some food for a starving friend and a quick search on Yelp led me here. Overall very pleased with the service and food!

Market Grille Cafe is located in a plaza on Rockspring Rd. and can easily be found with their humongous signage. Dine-in, take-out and catering available. 

I ordered based on my friendly server's suggestion and got their Traditional Gyro (beef and lamb). Also picked up a soup since my starving friend is a huge soup connoisseur.  

Their traditional gyro comes in 7-inch pita bread and is packed with loads of beef and lamb. They offer a choice of hummus or yogurt dill sauce but my server was kind enough to include both sauce on the side. Gyro itself is a big portion but this can also be made in a combo platter which comes with Greek salad, basmati rice, pita bread and hummus for additional charge of $4. Meaty, filling, and packed with flavor. Highly recommend. 

The soup I picked up is called Avgolemono and is also known as lemon, chicken and rice soup. This soup is similar to porridge and it is very lemon sour. You can get this in small ($4) or large ($6). 

Easily my top favorite place for gyro. Must try for any Mediterranean food lovers. And if you do decide to stop by, make sure to check-in on yelp for 20% off your order."}

Pumpkin Mushroom Soup, 
Lemon Rice Soup and a 
Moussaka platter-TO GO

Lots of flavor.  The Pumpkin Mushroom soup was  almost the consistency of baby food so not sure if it's suppose to be like this but nonetheless all the flavors of fall.

Lemon Rice Soup one of my favorites-you can order it in a 8oz size (cup) or a larger size.  Small size is only $3.50 and packed with a lemony tangy punch. Perfect for my little one battling a cold.

Moussaka Platter came with a Greek side salad and dressing, warm pita triangles and fabulous hummus which was very tasty, basmati flavorful rice and a \"slice\" of Mousakka which is potato, ground beef and eggplant.  Almost like a cross between a Shephards pie a lasagna.  It was very good.  Just had a corner piece so it was a little crunchy, would have liked a moister center piece instead.

I have been to the Market Grille before (at the location up North) so this was my first time here.  Parking reserved for take-out orders so that was nice.  Friendly service.

Hummus, Greek salad and lemon soup were the standouts!

Open Monday thru Saturday 11 a.m. till 10 p.m. 
Sunday noon-8 p.m.
Lunch Specials from $7.50 (11 a.m. -3 p.m.)
Happy hour everyday from 3-6 pm (dollar off wine, beer and appetizers)

Great deals and great meals found here!  Don't miss this fabulous hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I usually eat here in the evening.  I prefer this location over the other one that they have further North West.  But between the two locations they both have in common are the menus and some employees!  I was surprised to see the same person work at both locations on different days.  But kinda cool because they remembered what I ordered the previous day.  

I always get the first soup they have on the menu, I can't remember the name of it but it's the one with the rice in it!  I've tried numerous entree's too but always end up with the pomegranate chicken as the most flavorful.  The baklahva tastes the way it should, so much sugar and butter.  And I always love the hummus!  

This place is clean, the hostesses are nice and hardworking.  When you walk in you'll be surprised at their giant menu and visual menu on the tv screens!  But you can always go up to the cashiers and ask what they recommend!"}
{"text":"I like the relocation here, it's more bright and roomy.  (Wow, this has been in draft since last year).  I know a lot of people like this restaurant style and set up but I liked it the old way, like how Lake Mead/Rock Springs has it.  But whichever set up they have, the food is still tasty good.  

I come here so often, especially during my lunch break at work, that the owner knows exactly what I like to order and always places my order in while I'm being sat down to eat, how cool.  I like to sit at the booths but they have many open tables available and a special room for larger parties.  Patio seating too.  

My favorite dish continues to be Pomegranate Chicken and Baklava for dessert!  A minor gripe would be the young and inexperience servers.  I give them the benefit of the doubt because they're young and new but wow, some of them continue to not improve."}
{"text":"Ended up for lunch at Market Grille Café one day to get my Greek on.  It's OK!

Ordered off the 'Build Your Own' lunch menu for $7.50.  Comes with your choice of a main:

-Gyro (traditional beef & lamb, chicken, or veggie)
-Pomegranate Chicken
-Mediterranean Wrap (chicken, gyro, falafel, or veggie)

And choice of a side:
-Fries (Greek seasoned)
-Basmati Rice
-Salad (spinach or Greek)

I ordered the traditional Gyro and a side of fries.  Didn't take long for our order to come to our table, maybe about 10 minutes.  I admit, it looked pretty darn good.  Serving size was alright.  I could have used a few more fries on my plate, those things were yummy!  Fresh, hot, and covered in Greek seasoning (which I think has some paprika) & fresh herbs.  The Gyro was good as well, lots of meat (little aftertaste of laaaaammmmmbbbbb), fresh tomatoes, a nice tangy tzatziki sauce, feta cheese, chopped parsley, and a load of red onions!  Like, lots of them!  Luckily, I like onions.  Others may have been a bit put off by them.  But what's Greek food without red onions?  Less stinky LOL.

My big gripe about this lunch menu?  Why doesn't this combo come with a damn drink??  For that much moolah you should get at least a small soda!  What am I gonna drink with all those onions?  I did ask for a water cup, which I was happily obliged.  But still, did it drown out my lovely onion breath?  Hell no!  Eh, and I resort to an Altoid.

Overall the Gyro was pretty tasty.  The lamb/beef meat combo was flavorful and not dry, but that freshness from the tzatziki sauce and parsley took it home.  The pita was supple and airy, but with enough heft to hold up all the ingredients.  I managed to finish my lunch up nicely.

I'd be back to Market Grill Café more if the price for a Gyro was a bit more reasonable.  I like Greek and Mediterranean food, but me being a cheapy eater leaves me with no qualms going to Chipotle a few doors down for a lower priced fatty burrito (believe me, I often break tortillas with fillings), or In N Out right across the street.

Market Grill Café...let me have a drink!  Opa!"}
{"text":"Always great service and great food. They have a bomb happy hour too!! Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I don't quiet understand all the good reviews for this place. If I could divide this review into two different categories of service and food, I would. I would give 4 stars to service. I went there for the first time and didn't know the menu. The lady behind the counter was very friendly and helped me pick something out of the menu. They had a lunch special but somehow we ended up paying way too much for just lunch. And that brings us to the second category: Food. 

I'm not sure if this place is listed as Greek/ Mediterranean food; but if you have ever had authentic Mediterranean food, you would know that the tzatziki is a Greek yogurt sauce with tons of garlic. They call theirs \"dill sauce\" and it was yogurt with dill, no spices, no garlic, no flavor. Hubby and  I ordered the gyros, which was also too dry and without any flavor. Last but not least, the desert... We ordered a baklava. 

First of all, the piece they sell you is huge and they charge about $5. There is no way anyone would be able to finish that piece by themselves and if they could, well, then they should reconsider their dietary choices. Second of all, if you have ever had baklava before then you would know that it shouldn't taste like you are licking cinnamon's butt hole. Excuse my language but there was so much cinnamon and sugar in that piece of baklava that hubby and I both almost chocked on our first and the only bite. 

My recommendation: This place needs a serious revision of the menu. They should either stick with the Greek/ Mediterranean theme and learn how to make those dishes, or change their menu completely. Also, if you are looking for a more authentic taste of the Mediterranean cuisine, you might want to try Stephanos' or Baladie Cafe (my favorite)."}
{"text":"This place is honestly so bad. My self my girlfriend and her mom came in and we ordered three dishes , once we got home and began eating, mine was cold and very distasteful, my girlfriends was burnt, and my girlfriends moms was terrible all around. We called and asked for a refund. They said sorry but no refunds we can only make you another of what you've bought."}
{"text":"The first time I visited The market grill cafe they were in a hole in the wall location up in centennial hills. I'm so happy they've upgraded and what a beautiful, clean, precious neighborhood Greek restaurant they are now!!! You can choose to sit down and be served or order fresh fast food to go- i love that!!! The servers and staff are all super sweet. My favorite dishes are the Lentil soup, the falafel gyro platter, babaganoush, tabouleh, Greek salads and the hummus. Almost everything is served with plenty of warm pita!!! Most Greek restaurants are stingy with pita they are not!!!  AND I can't forget to mention the house wines are fantastic. Enjoy. Cheers!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in town to eat Greek!! I've tried several items on the menu and it's all delicious.. The Pomegranate chicken is to die for, moist and delish!!!!! The gyros are also fantastic! Save room for dessert and remember to try the baklava cheesecake! Opa!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Can't get enough of the pomegranate chicken! 
Trying a new dish, Mamma Mia's Chicken.
Olive oil brushed chicken grilled w/ a fig preserve-goat cheese topped wi/ crushed pistachios & sundried tomatoes!"}
{"text":"Favorite Greek/Mediterranean restaurant in Las Vegas. The family environment is wonderful, and whenever you dine in you feel like you're a part of that family. The customer service is off the charts fantastic, never have I once had to ask for a drink refill or the check, anything. 
The menu is full of family recipes that are fantastic, and I love how there are dishes named after the little grandsons. Such a sweet touch. Awesome food, don't like going anywhere else to get my Greek fix."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service left a sour taste in my mouth.

Market Grille Cafe is absurdly far from my place in Henderson, but I was willing to drive to Centennial Hills to meet up with some Yelp friends for a holiday gathering. We certainly had our share of socializing and gift-giving, but when it came down to the restaurant experience, we had service issues which added up to at least 30 minutes' worth of time wasted. And that's a very, very generous estimate.

For starters, our server seemingly ignored us for most of the time other than asking us what we wanted to drink. Perhaps this can be attributed to the crowded restaurant, including a large party in a private room to the side, but they should have either called in another employee or warned us in advance about the possible delay. We had to wave our server down both to order some appetizers and later on to request our entrees.

When entrees were brought out, my moussaka had mistakenly went to a friend who had ordered pastitsio, and an employee was calling out their pastitsio as moussaka. Yes, both are similarly layered dishes, but that shouldn't be an issue. You should be able to call the right dishes out regardless. (We did get the right entrees eventually.)

Finally, there was a concern with paying the bill which I'm not fully clear on, but some confusion at least resulted from the kitchen's mistake on one tablemate's entree necessitating a send-back/replacement order and some sort of change to the bill. And then there were concerns with splitting the check, which surely shouldn't be that difficult for a restaurant that has been around for so long and has such long tables as the one which accommodated the 11 of us. Oh, and it looked like 20% automatic gratuity was applied on top of all that? That was the last straw. I tip 15% minimum on principle and that would've possibly been too much tonight.

Food was pretty solid, for what it's worth. The saganaki ($11), a famous flaming Greek cheese dish, had all the presentation value and plenty of cheesy flavor (accompanied by sliced pita \"wedges\"). The moussaka entree ($13) was surprisingly light and fluffy, perhaps ending up a bit light on the meat compared to other restaurants' renditions. The sides were pretty solid, although the basmati rice was a bit undersalted, the hummus was oddly a little thin, and I can't ever understand why they don't dice the olives up in Greek salad. Bites of dishes such as spaghetti and Mamma Mia's Chicken were also satisfying. I could've probably given 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 if I didn't have other concerns.

That said, I simply can't envision myself ever returning to Market Grille Cafe with any sort of larger group. The food was tasty but not unique, the location kinda sucks for me (and anyone else who doesn't live in Centennial Hills or perhaps Aliante), and although I'm usually patient person, I really could've used the wasted time tonight in particular."}
{"text":"Experienced better food at the mall food court. Stopped in here for lunch and was greeted by the oldest hostess in the world! Her bad vibes were rubbing off on me. Took forever to get my order taken on top of that our waitress thick accent made me wonder if she got the order correct. When the order was on our table the first bite was okay and then it just went bland. Don't think I would ever step foot in this place again."}
{"text":"It was a cloudy day and I needed spaghetti.  Of course it could have been sunny and I would've wanted spaghetti but I digress.  There are times when even on vacation you want some comfort food and for me that's spaghetti.  I've had my fair share of it at a ton of places.  I like to compare.  Usually the taste, the type of sauce, taste of the sauce, is there even enough sauce? You know the basics.  Also if they have them with meatballs, sausage or meat sauce.  With me the type of meat is usually the only thing that differs.  
I proceeded to get the spaghetti with meatballs.  Time for some comfort!! Now this is a Mediterranean place so there is also a lot of Greek food which I'm sure is also delicious! Anywho when the waitress brought my plate I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't a huge dish. Because as much as I love spaghetti sometimes you just get full.  My plate also came with pieces of pita bread which were awesome! Only downside was that there wasn't enough sauce. I usually like a lot of sauce but it tasted great so not really a downside. The meatballs were small and just a bit dry but it was a mix of beef, veil and another meat I can't remember.  But they were also delicious.  
All in all I was happy with their spaghetti!!
I also decided to have the rice pudding!! Omg it was delicious!! It was smooth and creamy with cinnamon on top, which I'm not a fan of cinnamon but it paired so well with the rice pudding. 
Like I have said before the best way to eat is like a local!!"}
{"text":"I will never eat at either of their restaurants in a matter of principal.  My son worked there and they chet their employees out of wsges. The owner lied and told him he doesnt get paid overtime after 8 hours. He said overtime is only after 40 hours in a week. My son worked 9 and 10 hour days sometimes. Also they have to clock in for their shift according to the restaurant clock time which is set 5 minutes fast. So on the computer it shows them clocking in at 5 before the shift began. So at the end of the night they go into the computer and ajust the time and take away 5 minutes from each employee.  This is just dishonest robbery."}
{"text":"I just finished my lunch here and I think I may have a new Greek place to go to. I have wanted to try this place out for a while, but never had the chance. Luckily today I remedied that problem. 

The cafe itself is so cutely decorated and homey feeling. The menu is quite diverse and seems to have everything I have ever heard of in Greek food. I had a traditional gyro and was quite pleased. You can ask for the yogurt and hummus on the side, so you can try both options. Both are yummy and I don't think I could decide which was better, so the option to get both is great!  My daughter got the cheesy pita and ate almost the whole thing. This is a big deal because she usually eats one bite and is done. So I think that is another point for this place. 

I also felt very welcomed here as well. The staff is friendly and helpful. The manager stopped by my table several times to check on us, as well as chat a bit. It really feels like a neighborhood joint. I like this place! Go check it out when you have a minute."}
{"text":"I can't believe I lived near this Market Grille for 4 years and never stopped in for a bite until 3 years after I moved to the other side of the valley. Shame on me. But I did make it in the other day when a group of us from the office made the drive up the 95 for lunch. I must say I was impressed. The restaurant is small like a cafe as the name would suggest. But it is decorated well. It feels almost like somebody's backyard garden. The Greek music playing adds to the atmosphere.

For my lunch I ordered a traditional gyro with a Greek salad. The gyro was stuffed full of meat, lettuce, tomato, cucumber and onion all topped with a yogurt dill sauce. It was delicious and filling. All the stuff that fell out mixed well with the salad which had much of the same stuff. But it also had fetta cheese and olives. I can't not love that. It was a good solid meal. And the price was fair given the portions. No complaints in that department. I can't really complain about much of anything honestly. Sevice was good too. Friendly and quick the way it should be. It bothers me to pay for a bottle of water when most places have free water cups but whatever. I'm not going to hate on them over that.

I hope I get the chance to come back again in the future. Maybe on my own without the coworkers. A booth gets awful crowded with 4 fat a$$ dudes crammed in it. I'd be more comfortable dining solo."}
{"text":"Great place the food was great, nice portion and value, they really appeciate your busines. Food great, very clean and huge menu."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I'm giving three stars is because the food isn't bad. As far as I am concerned, however, the food is not good enough to warrant a return visit. There are many other places to get good Mediterranean food in Las Vegas. The service here is an absolute tragedy. At first, I felt like a burden to my server who was busy chatting with other employees. When I finally was able to capture the attention of my server, he seemed to be concerned that I wasn't going to eat enough to warrant his attention. My daughter and I were in a hurry that night and wanted appetizers and specialty coffee and cocktails. We ordered our hummus, pita, baba ghanouj, tabouli, and of course, spanakopita for dessert. I had a glass of wine, and my daughter a specialty coffee. Our bill was overwhelmingly expensive for decent food and judgmental, aloof, inefficient, and mediocre service at best. This restaurant seems to have a narcissistic personality disorder or some form of egomania in terms of their pricing structure. Prepare to feel like you could be eating the same for a few bucks from a Styrofoam plate at a street fair, but being charged prices more as though you were in a white linen tablecloth restaurant. The experience that I am referring to in this review is my second bad experience with this restaurant. I won't waste anymore of my time tonight to describe the absolutely insulting experience that I had here on my birthday. In summary: The Market Café offers extremely an inflated pricing structure for less than lackluster service with decent food. Bring your credit card, as that's what seems to really matter here."}
{"text":"This Centennial Hills location for some reason is a little better then the Lake Meade location.  I love to get the gyros here and my boyfriend loves the Pom-Chicken Salad.  The cannolis are also good for a Greek place.  I have not tried much of the other items because I've been happy with the gyros.  The servers have always been friendly and takeout was also a good experience the one time I did that.  When I don't feel like making dinner this is an easy place to go for something better then fast food and not too expensive.  I first tried this place about a year ago because I saw it on \"Sister Wives!\"  Hahaha!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to fulfill a craving I had for Chicken Gyro's! This was my first visit & I ordered the Chicken Gyro platter with the yogurt dill sauce, all I can say is I'm impressed. The chicken is delicious & tender, with the fresh veggies & homemade warm pita. The rice is very good as well as the hummus & Greek salad. 

I'm definitely coming back again for some delicious Mediterranean style cuisine.
Highly recommend you give this place a try."}
{"text":"There was a time when I really liked this place, at least this location anyway. But that changed after my last visit. Word to the wise: it doesn't pay to be a Frequent Diner Card holder, at least where the lunch specials are concerned.

I ordered off the lunch specials menu as I have done in the past and when the total came, I remembered that I had my Frequent Diner Card. I pulled it out and noticed I had all 10 punches, so yay me, free lunch, well give or take $1 and some change for the remaining balance. So the cashier called her manager over to get it squared away. The manager came over and after a few seconds of examination, she notified me that I couldn't use the $10 off card because I was ordering off the lunch specials menu which she mumbled something about it being already \"discounted\" and that I needed to use it on an entree instead. I think I gave her a death look and instead of immediately questioning the ridiculousness that she just stated which was NOWHERE WRITTEN ON THE LUNCH SPECIALS MENU NOR IN THE FINE PRINT OF MY FREQUENT DINER CARD, I grabbed my useless card from the manager and paid for my meal. I'm not a complete douchebag after all. It was lunch time, the lines were long, I was hungry, I'm sure the people behind me were hungry so there.  

Yet, the more I thought about it, the more irritated I became. I re-read the card just to make sure I didn't miss something. About the only thing I think that would apply is the \"Management reserves all rights\" part. Perhaps her reservation with me being able to use that card, even toward the \"discounted\" lunch specials is that I wasn't paying for more than one lunch special. Then I got to thinking, the last time I came into this place, I ordered off the lunch specials menu and got the10th punch on my card. The card clearly states that you get one puch for every $10 purchase and even after ordering those \"discounted\" lunch specials, with a drink and tax, it comes out to a little over $10. So what's their policy again about using the card toward the lunch specials? Oh right. They don't really have one, do they??

I wanted to say something to the manager who denied me the $10 off but she was nowhere to be found after I was done with my meal and I had to get back to work. I decided to visit the website which is a wealth of information if one is looking to book them for their next event. Unfortunately, there is no comments section, just a card to fill out for catering purposes. But interestingly enough, I found the lunch specials are listed on the website at $7.50 and they are supposed to include a beverage. Why is it at this location (Lake Mead), the $7.50 does not include a beverage? I have always been charged for a drink. So basically, my \"discounted\" lunch special of $7.50 plus $2.25 for a drink plus tax came out to $11.08 for my lunch. Had I been able to use my $10 off card, I would've paid my remaining balance and left the cashier a nice fat tip which would've elicited a bell ringing followed by a hearty \"OPA!\" from the kitchen, as I've always done whenever I have visited. But that was not to be and at this point, it's doubtful I will ever return, at least to this location. 

I must add, the quality of their food has also gone downhill. When I first started coming here, I really liked the Greek salad. But I noticed during my last couple of visits, the salad is completely bland with very few vegetables, olives, feta and the lettuce is always wilted as if it's a week old.  They're overcharging \"discounted\" specials that are supposed to include drinks, not honoring the frequent diner card and their food is mediocre fast food at best. That's a damn shame."}
{"text":"Great lunch menu! For about $9 you get selection of gyro, wrap or kabob with 1 side and a drink. Serving is huge, and food is tasty. It's packed around peak lunch hour time so be sure to come a little earlier or later to grab a seat. 

I had the spinach wrap with French fries and it was tasty. Definitely will fill you up, and unless your starving you can almost get away with sharing one wrap with a friend. I will say though, their French fries that I had, had way too much seasoning making it super salty. If your sensitive to salt I'd recommend telling them go easy on the seasoning or omit all together."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Greek restaurant I've eaten at in the Las Vegas area.  Visited the first time based on the positive reviews and great word of mouth as well as a Billboard on US-95 that said it was voted a Best in Vegas restaurant.  Well this place didn't disappoint at all and we brought family visiting from out of town for a follow-up trip and they absolutely loved it as well!

Positives
1) Service was best in class!  Servers were both exceptionally knowledgeable about the menu and gave fantastic recommendations.  Servers were friendly and prompt with drink refills and ensuring every menu item was to our liking.
2) Menu is great with a nice variety of both Greek and Italian options.  Recommend the Saganaki & Hummus appetizers.  The Gyros were absolutely fantastic; we had the Gyro Meat, Pomegranate Chicken, and Falafel.  They also have salads, pasta, wraps, and a good selection of traditional Greek favorites.
3) Wine & Beer selection isn't robust but has a nice variety and surely something to match any taste.  You have some traditional domestics and imports and some draft beer options.  Red & white wines available from Napa Valley, California Coast, as well as Italian, Greek, Argentinian, and French wines.  Didn't try the Sangria but it was recommended.
4) Prices were more than reasonable and food portions were generous."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I love it when they say 'opa\" after you place your order. Everyone is super friendly and the food comes out quickly. I generally order the Keftedes. The meatballs are delicious with the yogurt dill sauce and rice. However, the bf decided to get the traditional gyro and it was unbelievably tasty! I think next time I will get the traditional gyro and call it good. I definitely will be back next time I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"Called in a take-away order and picked it up. I ordered pasta stefano - delicate al dente angel hair with a wonderfully light and tangy lemon and garlic sauce, nicely salty Parmesan cheese, capers and fresh basil. I really enjoyed it and wished it was served in a larger portion. I'm used to oversized portions so this was probably a dietary normal size!! 

We also had the traditional gyro plate. The gyro meat was nice and tender with traditional flavor. The tsatziki sauce was cool and creamy with a little tang. 

Of course we had to get pita bread with tsatziki on the side. The pita was light, served warm and was pleasantly chewy and soft. 

We shared a Greek salad to round out our meal. The greens were fresh and crispy. I always look closely at salads to make sure all the greens and vegs are clean. Everything looked well washed and appropriately cleansed. 

We finished by sharing the Aphrodite cheesecake and a slice of baklava. I'd never had cheesecake with baklava crust but now I'm convinced that's the way it should be served! It was a much appreciated departure from graham cracker crust although it did make it ultra rich - which was not a bad thing!  The cheesecake itself could have been a little smoother/creamier but it was light and not too dense. The slice of baklava was a little dry. I'm not sure what the authentic prep is but I'm used to baklava saturated in honey sugar glaze. The flavor was great though and I like eating it by peeling later after layer off. 

All in all, it was an awesome take away meal. We did without utensils, plates etc because we were just going home to eat it, but everything came well packaged in nice and sturdy containers which is nice for taking away. I am definitely going back for another take away and am going to try some of the other dishes. I can't wait to try the babaganoush, the dolmades, and the falafels, mousaka and spanakopita. They have a trio platter that looks yummy. 

If you want take away that is above your just average Chinese, this is the place. The menu has plenty of variety and take away is served nicely. It's convenient also as they have a separate walk in area just for take away orders. Nicely done, guys!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Healthy, but overated and over priced.

The quality is good, but it is way over priced. I last went there with my health conscious son. 

I have tried both the salads and entrees. They just don't seem complete and satisfying unless you order extras.  It's priced as if you are paying for \"atmosphere\", but in reality, it's like Panera Bread, but with Grape Vine Wallpaper. 

It's a good place to go for something quick and heatlhy. I don't reccomend it for a date, unless you're in high school."}
{"text":"So good an healthy. You must eat here.
My first time love love it.
Amazing good great atmosphere and excellant service.

{"text":"Best greek food I have had in Vegas so far.  Great service and clean environment. 

Started with the appetizer sampler plate.  Falafel, greek salad, baba ganoush, hummus, and dolmades. The stuffed grape leaves were good.  The inside had so much flavor. The hummus was kinda runny and wasn't that great.  The salad is a salad, not much to say there.  The falafel and the baba ganoush were fantastic.  The falafel was so good.  Not dry whatsoever.  The baba ganoush had a lot of flavor as well.  Great eggplant flavor. 

My wife ordered the lamb souvlaki entree. It came with rice and a vegetable skewer.  The rice was okay. The vegetable skewer had a great char on it and a great marinade.  The lamb was excellent.  So flavorful and had a nice lamb taste.  I ordered the entree sampler with spanakopita, moussaka, and a macaroni pie.  The pie was forgettable, but still had some flavor.  The moussaka was very cheesy and the eggplant and tomato sauce was fantastic.  The spanakopita was the best part of the meal.  The phyllo dough was baked to a nice brown color and the spinach inside was so good. It had the right amount of feta cheese to flavor the spinach. 

This place is a must try.  If your looking for good greek food, you just found it."}

{"text":"This restaurant has a place in my heart because they are so incredibly accommodating to a vegan diet. They have items on the menu that can be modified to be vegan. It's so refreshing to have a waitress not even bat an eye at that request. The food is delicious and a great atmosphere. 

My only constructive criticism would be to get cushions for their outdoor chairs because they are really uncomfortable.

Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We love this place!! Always can count on good, fresh food! The only downside is they are closed on Sundays! I also love that they now offer sit down service for dinner. Both locations are delicious."}
{"text":"Stop by this place for lunch after hearing how great it was. Ordered their famous pomegranate chicken with rice. Let me just say I had high hopes and it was total disaster. The chicken is too sweet the undesirable taste of sweet pomegranate is just way too much for me. The rice was gross had no taste. The portion overall is small and pricey for the quality of food l. At least add some salad to balance the sweet taste of the chicken. I didn't eat all of it way too sweet. Will never be back!! Nor will I ever recommend this place"}
{"text":"Not bad for the price but def had a lot going on inside. I'm used to really really great Greek food so maybe I'm bias. Just wasn't up to the \"best Greek\" food name as I was hoping."}
{"text":"Best Greek food I've had in years. The pumpkin mushroom soup is to die for! Everything I've had here has been at least above-average, but mostly great. Lots of vegetarian options. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was their taziki...it tasted different. Not bad, just different. Service is impeccable...even the manager checks on us. Prices are extremely reasonable. Love Love Love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I hadn't visited this restaurant in awhile even though it's in my neighborhood. I will definitely be adding it to my \"regulars\" - I was happily surprised to find that they've updated their menu to include many vegetarian and vegan options! The service was fast and friendly, and the food was delicious. All in all, I really felt like they are making a concerted effort to improve."}
{"text":"one visit in 2012, three visits in 2015.  i'm usually very friendly, but this place keeps proving me wrong.  Friends or family want to try it.  

1st visit - I'm allergic to onions - food had onions.  
2nd visit - see first. 
3rd visit - they know I'm going to be a beeyach about onions, so I order the minimalist kabob and don't get many options.  
4th visit with Vegan cousins. - meat in all the orders by the vegans.  By this time, I'm ordering fries and some kabob meat, and that's all,  but being charged full entree price. 
5th visit with Vegan cousins - meat, meat, meat.  Really not liking this place by now.  Haven't been back."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and fresh! Staff is friendly and service is always good. I can't even count how many times I've eaten here and I have never been disappointed. It's hard to save room for dessert but it's worth it if you can. :)"}
{"text":"I love the food and ambience in this restaurant.  I'm not actually a fan of greek food but when i do get the mood for it, this is the only place i would go.  Their lamb gyro is the bomb.. very tender and flavorful.  Their aphrodite cheesecake is also very scrumptious.  

The staff seems to be very knowledgeable.  They really walked me through the menu on very first visit.  Overall very good experience and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I'm a super regular and I always order the chicken wrap with a side fries. Every time I order it's always in the best quality and I never complained about anything. Not only do I love their food but also thier customer service and that's one of the biggest reasons why I always come back! I seriously love this place and I will always support this restaurant by introducing my friends and family."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Their greek salads are so delicious!! I'm so glad this place is right near my job and is healthier than the other options we have over here for lunch. I also really love the veggie gyro and their lunch menu combo is such a deal. Fast service and my food always come out the way I want it (except once my fries were extremely over cooked.) The workers here are also very nice too. Def check this place out."}
{"text":"Very mediocre.  That's the very best I can say.  I happen to come from an area where Mediterranean food was on almost every street corner so I may be spoiled.  The Spinach Pie was small and not tasty at all.  The Hummus had very little flavor and the texture was very odd.  AND finally the Greek Salad was nothing like any Greek salad I have ever had.   I don't see me coming back.  I am giving them a two star just because the staff was nice"}
{"text":"Yak! Just did not like food. The appetizer plate was ok but not great. I ordered chicken with pomegranate. It was sickening sweet. It's said fresh pomegranate which normally is tart. This was like a thick glaze. Think jelly like. Hubby had a trio of different Greek casserole type meals like moussaka. He said it was ok. $60 and I'm hungry 1 1:2 hrs later. Won't go back"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is delicious and prices are reasonable. Everything my husband and I have ordered here has been tasty and made fresh. The hummus is fantastic as is the falafel. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place from the service to the food and décor. I had the gyro lunch special it was very yummy and you can't beat 7.50. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place is almost too good to be true from the moment you step foot in the door to the moment you leave.

My wife and I had just left the rudest gyro place in vegas and decided to try another one.  We find the Market Grille and decide to give her a shot.  We walk in and WOW.  The place was beautiful.  It was lit up but not too bright, music was playing just loud enough to be relaxing and everyone in there looked happy. 

After being blown away on the appearance, we get to the cashier and this girl was just a joy to be around.  Helpful, nice, smiling, happy and we couldn't have been happier.  So after taking our order we sit down.  I get up to go wash my hands and come back and see the waiter already at the table.  I sit down with my wife and this guy Michael or Mike has to be the greatest waiter i've ever met.  I've never laughed so much at a restaurant before.  He was able to describe everything on the menu to a science.  Nicest guy in the world.  

So we ordered 1 lamb and beef Gyro and 1 all lamb Gyro, a family size seasoned fries, and 2 drinks.  Before I could finish filling up my drink cup, Mike, with that huge smile on his face, was bringing us the biggest, most delicious looking fries i've ever seen with some kind of orange looking sauce.  We ask about the sauce and Mike just winks and says \"trust me.\"  So we eat the fries and thank god we trusted him because we fell in love with that orange spicy sauce on those fries.  So good.......so good.

So then we get our Gyros and I swear, we took one bite and went into heaven.  I saw my wife's eyes literally rolled back when she took a bite.  She couldn't even finish chewing before she had to tell me how tender and good the meat was.  By  the way, those Gyros were massive.  We utterly destroyed those Gyros.  I can't remember the dessert she had, but it was a yellow looking cake and she finished it so fast, I'm not sure if she tasted it lol.

By far,one of the best experiences at a resteraunt.  I think we payed a little over 20 bucks for everything.  I know the Gyro's were 8 bucks each.  By far, the best 20 dollars you'll ever spend.

I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Very good gyros and seasoned fries! Our server was also on the ball and very courteous."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch and the place is packed!  That is always a good sign!  The service was great very friendly and helpful.  They list gluten free, vegan , etc. in their menu.  I had a cup of cauliflower soup that was so good and then a Greek salad with gyro meat.  It was huge with tons of meat for $11.  They have fresh brewed iced tea in 2 flavors.  I had to have a box to take home half the salad.  They use very fresh ingredients and almost everything is made fresh."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best lunch I have ever had! The wrap and salad was incredible! My husband had the gyro and agreed it was the best he has ever had! Great service too! The price was great for the amount of food! I will definitely be eating here as much as possible!!"}
{"text":"I joined two other Yelpers here for lunch last weekend and really enjoyed my food. The restaurant was also a good spot to hang out and chat for a bit.

Previous to dining at this location I had been to the location on Durrango where lunch was a sit down dining experience. This location does it differently with orders being placed at the counter and then brought to the table. I actually preferred this style for a weekend lunch.

I ordered a Falafel Mediterranean Wrap with Greek Salad. This was one of the lunch specials for less than $10. The wrap was large enough to take half home. The falafel was yummy and I loved the taste of all of the wrap ingredients together. The side salad was also a nice size and I liked their Greek dressing.

The food didn't take long to arrive and the staff continued to check on us and cleared plates. I was also offered a takeout box for my leftovers without having to ask for one."}
{"text":"This was a logical choice for a nice lunch after hiking at Mount Charleston on a Saturday. The restaurant is conveniently located near the 95 in a very busy shopping center.

The menu has too many good options to the point of being almost overwhelming! It offers wraps, gyros, salads, traditional Greek entrees, appetizers, pizzas, pastas, and soups. Entrees are offered a la carte or as a full entrée with sides for varying appetite levels. The lunch special is a great deal and includes a main item like a gyro, a side, and a drink for $8.50.

I went for the lunch special with a Mediterranean Wrap with Pomegranate Chicken (small upcharge) and Fries (with Greek seasoning). The pomegranate chicken inside of the wrap was delicious and a truly unique offering. The flavor of the overall wrap was great with plenty of vegetables inside. Half of the wrap was plenty of food for me. The Fries were nicely seasoned and tasty as well.

My husband had the Stuffed Green Peppers which were very good. The flavors in the stuffing were delicious and it had plenty of seasoning for flavor. The rice and hummus sides were tasty too. I loved the homemade Greek dressing that came with the salad. 

Our server was very friendly and gave us a nice overview of the menu to help us make our lunch choices. After our meal a manager or owner came by to make sure we had a good experience and enjoyed our food. I love businesses that really care about the quality of their food and service."}
{"text":"Had chicken skewer platter from here, rice was perfect. good meal. will bring husband when they move to new location on durango in oct"}
{"text":"The best greek food in town!!! The service is always excellent and the food is homemade and fresh.  The dining atmosphere is quaint and romantic.  Our newborn was lulled to sleep by the live music on a Friday evening!! Great for a date night or just family fun."}
{"text":"The moment I walked in I felt like I'd been here before-
As I became happier for my choice of walking in I heard an, \"Opa!\"
Gyro was Stellar- I don't know I've had one better- and I've had plenty- stayed in the tin foil and didn't spill everywhere-
Healthy portion of lamb was good for me and I'm a Big eater-
Side salad with entree was awesome - the olives were amazing-
Hummus was awesome-
Great atmosphere- clean- 
I even liked the video playing of a few different dishes being prepared-
Excited to eat here again!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute place for lunch and dinner. The vineyard decor is really cute and cozy. There have a lot of Mediterranean and Italian food options to choose from which we're all delicious. They best part is that everything is decently priced for the quality and portion of food you get."}
{"text":"Been coming here for the past couple months since I moved into the neighborhood. 

Overall food is a good deal for the price. Everything is fresh and good quality. Chicken skewers can be quite dry, so I would opt for the roasted chicken entree or the pomegranate chicken. 

Seems that a lot of people on here are complaining about the sauces. Every Mediterranean restaurant has their own style, so if you are expecting humus like you buy in the store, then don't. Yes, their humus is a bit less thick than what most are used to, and their satziki sauce has a lot of garlic. But everything is homemade! Try telling your mom to modify her family recipe to match a store brand. Psh!

One of the staff forgot to include part of my order when I came to collect it, but they redeemed themselves by being overly apologetic and giving me a box of free cookies. Also, they have a rewards card as well. I'm a fan of any place that does this!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for greek food, this place is the place for you! 
I was seriously craving gyros so my boyfriend and I decided to come here. As soon as we walk in we were greeted then sat down at a booth. It was a tuesday night so it was pretty slow, not many people there at the time which we kind of like. As soon as we sat down our server asked if we wanted any drinks and at the time we just ordered waters. After she left we realized they had a special that night for $2 off beers. So of course we were going to take advantage of that! We ordered to blue moons and they were on tap so they tasted sooo good.
Everything on the menu sounded so good, but in the end I decided to get a lamb gyro platter, my boyfriend decided on the pasta angelo and we got platos potatoes to share. 
The platos potatoes were really good, they're basic fries but the seasoning that was on them made them stand out. We couldn't stop eating them! 
The lamb gyro platter was huge. It comes with the gyro, side of rice, side of pita bread and a side salad. They served the salad way ahead of the rest of the platter which was nice, it gave me time to eat it before the rest of my food came. The lamb gyro was AMAZING. The lamb was so tender and juicy, had a good amount of lettuce, tomato and sauce. It was exactly what I wanted! The rice was really good too. Nicely seasoned. The pita bread they gave me was plain jane but they gave me hummus to go with it so that was really nice too. 
The pasta angelo plate seemed like it didn't come with a lot, but my boyfriend couldn't finish the dish it was so filling! He was pleasantly surprised. He loved the flavors, the pasta had spinach, mushrooms, tarragon and a nice buttery sauce. 
All in all, this place is really good. It's a perfect place for a little date night, or if you're just really craving greek food. The service is nice, the food is great and filling. The portions here are huge so you definitely get what you pay for! I will be coming here more often for sure."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place. They use a lot of dill!  It's a bit pricey for what you get. Service is ok"}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place out, based on the reviews and their menu.  The saganaki was great (but how much can you mess that up?), the veg dolmades were very strangely sweet and just didn't taste right (but at least were homemade and better than the oily, canned varieties).  My Mamma Mia chicken may have been great but the chicken was so incredibly overcooked, dry, hard little shards on the outside, that it reminded me of the turkey in Griswold Family Christmas.  We nearly sent it back but since our waitress was already wildly efficient but none too friendly, I didn't feel like dealing with it.  The sides were okay (hummus, potatoes), my husband thought his spanakopita was just average but that his pastitio and moussaka were good.  I've had greek food before (not just in American restaurants but in Greeks' homes and in Greece) and this stuff was just spiced so oddly. I'm guessing perhaps it's the geographic influence or...?  We will given them another try, their menu is extensive, but I think we may try the other location.  We are hoping for the best."}
{"text":"I try to be generous when it comes to \"family owned\" businesses, but this one needs a wake-up call before it goes out of business for lack of business. 

I could not wait for the place to open this past October. You can smell what seems to be yummy-ness in the air outside the restaurant and inside. I haven't had the occasion to dine in there but I decided I'd order take-out tonight (Fri 1/6/12) to give it a try. Man was I disappointed.

First, some reviewers have written \"a little pricy\", I have to say IT IS VERY OVERPRICED. I mean, you'd expect to pay too much on the strip (still for a decent portion) but this is a neighborhood spot across from a grocery store. 12 bucks for 1 skimpy meat skewer, 1 \"vegetable\" skewer of sliced tomato & onions, about 1.5 tablespoons of dill sauce, chencey chopped salad with a thimble-full of dressing, and 1/2 of a pita, cut into fourths so that it gives the appearance of more. I mean for $12 you could at least give a whole pita; it's cheap bread. This had to be the skimpiest meal I've had in a long time. I was really hungry and I don't eat a lot of food. But I was still hungry when I finished. I think there might have been enough food for my 3 year old nephew. But any restauranteur should know that if you load up the plate with cheap sides (rice, salad, bread). You've at least given the appearance of a generous portion.

.... but let me continue. 

Second, the quality was really bad. There was a big wad of moistened seasoning mix in my rice that I bit into - yuk! Yet, the rice was dry, dry dry. The salad was too much chopped onion, some chopped cucumber (I'm guessing they chop them small for the dill sauce and save some for the salad), chopped lettuce and a few kalamata olives. The featured skewers (lamb & tomato/onion) were okay but I've had skewers just as good at the kabob place with the same amount of sides for half the price. By the way, the olives were the tastiest part of the entire meal.

Finally, the food temperature was just above warm. I'll give them a little reprieve in this area because they said it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. We live just around the corner from the place and we picked it up at 15 minutes. I guess they hadn't planned on packaging to maintain the temperature of the food.

So will I return, nope, not without a half off coupon so that I can get my money's worth. I will continue to search for quality Greek food and know that I can get a least better food at the Mad Greek."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at any of the Market Grille Cafe locations.

The staff is always friendly and the food is always great.  I usually get a gyro plate, but the pomegranate chicken is delicious as well.

Also, save room for dessert, or order some to go, because the baklava cheesecake is AMAZING."}
{"text":"Went here today. First time for Greek food. Outstanding fresh food and service. Owner came over and spoke to us. Very very nice place. Will most definitely go back soon. Very comfortable and relaxing atmosphere"}
{"text":"I love this place. The ambiance is so nice. The food quality is good and they offer great tasting gyros. My husband introduced me to this place. My favorite is the pomegranate chicken with the salad. My husband loves the cheesecake. I love it as well. However, I didn't like the baklava crust. It taste funky."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Saganaki, but the cheese was swimming in oil. Gross. Maybe I'll try it again at another resturant."}
{"text":"Met some friends but wasn't hungry so I had a pumpkin chai tea.  It was delicious but what made my time memorable was the service.  Cody was personable and made sure everything for our group was going fine.  When he got busy, the other server took good care of us with getting  coffee and taking our picture.  They have everything here good food and great service."}
{"text":"YUMMY!  Can't wait to go back.  I just had the chicken gyro today because I wasn't very hungry but it was DELISH! I can't wait to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! Try the roasted red pepper hummus or the filet skewers! Great service and it's not uncommon to see the owner and his family working and greeting guests."}
{"text":"The food was so good and the service on point no complaints from me. I was seated pretty quickly and the food was prepared in a reasonable time. I can't wait to come back in and try something new !!"}
{"text":"If I had wanted fast food, I'd have gone to my local burger takeout joint.  But I didn't; I wanted to enjoy a leisurely dinner with my +1, having just returned home after a solo month on the east coast.

I hadn't been to Market Grille since shortly after they'd opened.  My husband had gone one time after with a friend and wasn't crazy about it, but we were both up for Greek food, so he agreed.  We were seated quickly; I ordered my customary Riesling (very stingy pour for $8.50) and hubby had a glass of Sangria, full of tasteless fruit and missing the kick of additional spirits.  We chose Pomegranate Chicken for me, and Moussaka for him.  He also ordered a bowl of Avgolemono soup.  

Salads, which came with the meal, were delivered right away, with small cups of dressing on the side.  The two cups looked like Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger in \"Twins.\"  One was a clear golden color, i.e. straight oil.  The other, dark and full of seasonings.  Strike one.  But they changed the pale twin.  It didn't help much - still bland.

Not 20 seconds after the salads hit the table, the soup was delivered.  And right behind that, without missing a beat, came the entrees.  Needless to say, we protested.  And the dishes returned from whence they came, probably to sit under a heat lamp.

The small salad was okay, but quite ordinary, except for the addition of a tiny bit of feta.  The soup had shredded chicken that seemed dry.  Avgolemono should be served with bread, and at every Greek restaurant I've ever eaten in a basket of pita is served at the beginning.  Not here.  The only pita in sight came as three tiny triangles on the entree plate which, if the serving pace had been correct, would have come AFTER the soup was finished.  Chintzy, for sure.

My Pomegranate Chicken looked pretty sitting on that white plate.  It was tender, but strangely tender, since it was also somewhat dry.  A big mound of rice and small cup of okay hummus came with it, along with those three pita bites.  They didn't bother to reheat the rice before re-serving my dish.  Growing up in New York and living in New Jersey, I'm no stranger to Greek, having cut my eyeteeth on Greek diners.  I've had moussaka in Astoria, Queens and in Greece.  And I've never seen a portion as tiny as the one served at Market Grille:  a single half-height layer, and half the width of any portion of moussaka in the free world.  Did hubby mistakenly order a kid's meal?

To make up for the woeful experience, the manager \"graciously\" offered to comp the soup and take 20% off the bill.  But really, it was just the soup that would be adjusted, since anyone checking in on Yelp can get that 20% discount.

Next time I need my Greek/Mediterranean fix, I'll go back to my beloved Crazy Pita, where I can get fresh veggies along with couscous, salad, hummus, and lot more pita for less cash.  And a staff that truly values my business."}
{"text":"This was our friends' suggestion for dinner.  Having been to the Lake Mead location, we thought it would be okay, but it was a big disappointment.

All four of us ordered the Greek Trio Platter - Spanakopita, Pastitsio, and Moussaka, which included a small Greek salad and a tiny cup of hummus on the plate, along with baby-sized pita triangles.  

The spinach pie was sorely lacking in spinach, and didn't even look attractive.  The meat in the other two items was ground so fine that it was like a paste.  I guess it's hard to avoid overcooking the macaroni in the pastitsio, since it's boiled, then baked, then reheated, but this was mush.  The pastitsio and moussaka were sorely lacking in flavor and seasoning, and the hummus was watery and tasteless.  Even the Greek salad, which I'm not a big fan of, since I don't love feta and always find the dressing too sharp for my taste, had a balsamic dressing that was too bland.

It's been a very long time since that meal at the Lake Mead branch, and since then I've had many wonderful dinners at other Greek restaurants.  This one just didn't measure up."}
{"text":"I love their pomegranate chicken! It has a delectable taste if you are a fan of sweet meats. It went nicely with the salad and hummus! I also ordered the spanakopita which I would pass on. Honestly go to Smiths frozen food section and you will find some tastier ones.
I'm not a fan of the set up. You have to order and pay first (Carl's Jr. Style). The problem with this is that you may under order. I wanted to try dessert after my meal but I didn't want to go through the line and use my debit card again. I don't like to order my dessert before I have my meal because I'm not sure how I will feel after. I think it would be nicer as a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Love their rice pudding!! Love their pomegrante chicken!! Love the Hummus! Love the Cheesecake!! Love pretty much everything. Healthy option for eating out, in two very convinient locations in Vegas. 

I've never had a meal here that I didn't enjoy. The service was great and the atmosphere is great also. I like to sit on the patio with misters whenever the weather permits. 

You can tell this is a family ran place because you can taste it in the food."}
{"text":"Great lunch special. I wont do dinner anymore here because you can get pretty much the same meal for a lunch special price instead of dinner. Usually lunch specials come with entree, side, and a drink. I wouls highly recommend trying the lunch specials out, from 11:00 a.m - 3:00 p.m. Also, theres a discount if you are a LVAC member! Great food and awesome service!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Portions are great and flavors are amazing. The menu options all sound amazing and I plan to try most of it! I've had the traditional gyro and the roasted lamb! So good! I also had to try the Aphrodite cheesecake that's like two desserts in one due to the baklava crust"}
{"text":"Not good at all. Washed down Greek food, with sweet and bitter dressing. The gyro meat tasted soft as it had been left over night then heated up. The cucumber yogurt was sour. The coffee was also bitter and sour, if that's even possible. Worst 16 bucks spent."}
{"text":"Quaint little spot nuzzled in the Durango shopping complex very friendly wait staff which is really nice. I would suggest anything with the filet just a beautiful seasoning on the meat and very tender. I'm really not a fan of hummus or Greek yogurt so I never put it on my plate but I do recommend the skewers over rice a great little meal that will leave you wanting to come back several times to taste it again. I also recommend the pomegranate chicken very refreshing and out of the ordinary that yoy will usually see here in vegas. I wish that the wine selection was a bit more varied but for the location and food this is definitely a spot you should use for a date night out with someone special."}
{"text":"Delicious pomegranate chicken and fries. Their beer is really good as well. For my first time here it definitely won't be my last. 
The customer service was great that even though table service started after we arrived and we wouldn't get someone coming to take our order the server there helped me make my choice and answered all my questions. I haven't seen service like this from someone who takes your order at the counter."}
{"text":"I was really unimpressed by the quality of the food, especially for the price! It wasn't bad, but not somewhere I'll be going again."}
{"text":"Ordered for pick-up last week when we were feeling lazy but not feeling greasy food. This place is amazing. The to-go person over the phone was super friendly and made the order easy, best part, it would be ready in 10 minutes. 

They have cute little separate to-go area complete with waiting area. Our food was ready and fresh and was SO good. 

Even better - the price was perfect.

Found our new to-go spot

:)"}
{"text":"This place has great Greek dishes, very authentic.  They do have foods for everyone, however Vegans beware as yogurt is used in a lot of dishes.  With that being said, if you leave this place hungry and unsatsfued, it's your own fault.

Highly recommended..."}
{"text":"Not impressed. It was the first time we tried it, and the service stank. We did not have a designated waitress, and all the girls seemed annoyed. No one really wanted to wait on our table. Service was slow and once we were done our meal and had our to-go box, no one ever came back to give us the bill or run our card. Basically were we were held hostage.

Edited to add:  Gave it another try. Food was delicious again, but the service was still lacking.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Our first time there and it was a superb one!  Great flavor, texture and variety. Wonderful vegetarian options and my vegetarian daughter was very happy w the vegginini!  Wonderful place. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a favorite amongst almost every local I've met. The pumpkin baklava cheesecake is the best desert around. Pomegranate chicken is a taste that can't be matched anywhere else. 

Offers a 10% military discount with ID & has call ahead to-go."}
{"text":"Ever since coming here, my hubby keeps talking about eating more Greek food. I've been to MGC about 3 times, once to their restaurant in Centennial, and twice to their casual eatery.

{"text":"Four stars !!! I Don't think so !!! First of all I got take out ok !!! I had to look for the lamb on the 9.50 roasted Gyro !!! Then I had to look for the Hummus on the platter !!! Was in a little bitty container !!! 5.95 for a large soup , which would have been a cup in Detroit or Chicago !!! Of course I am finding that the people don't mind paying lots of money for mediocre food !!! Still looking for a off strip mid -eastern place that has good food !!!"}
{"text":"Great service like always. Too bad David wasn't here, but at least Shelly was really good & friendly; easy to talk to. She put in the 20% like how i checked in earlier for the special. Like I said take advantage of it now before it expires soon."}
{"text":"The food is very authentic, great portions and wonderful service! This is my favorite Greek place in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food and a casual atmosphere. The falafel appetizer is enough for 3 people to share. My friend really enjoyed the pumpkin-mushroom soup. My favorite is the spanakopita. If you get the entree size it is a lot of food because it comes with some greek salad, basmati herb rice, hummus and pita bread for about $11. The pomegranate chicken is really good, whether you get it alone, in a salad, or in a wrap. The traditional gyro is also really good, and very large. You can get it with yogurt dill sauce (which I recommend) or hummus. The salmon wrap is excellent, and you can choose a spinach or tomato basil wrap (both great). They sell greek beer and wine, but their soda selection isn't that fantastic. I really wish they would get coke zero (they have diet coke). The desserts are gigantic, and the yia yia's cookies are enough to take back to your office or home to share. The pumpkin baklava cheesecake is to die for! Enough for 2. The service is great, you stand in line to order and it's usually short, and then they bring you your food. The staff is very friendly. If you go on their website there is a coupon for 2 glasses of house wine with a $25 purchase! They have a food slideshow going on a TV you can watch if you want to see what some of the food looks like. To sum it up, I highly recommend this place and I go back often! Oh and BONUS! They have a punch card and after you go 10 times you get $10 off your next check."}
{"text":"Amazing Isn't Even The Word ! I'm Greek & I've Ate At Plenty Greek Places & Never None Like This! I Ate The Saganaki, It Came With Freshly Cut Pita Bread & I Also Ordered a Chicken Gyros. It Was Demolished In 10 minutes Even With My Braces On. There Was Nothing But Great Service From My Waiter David. He Was Kind, And Answered All My Questions & Even Suggested Items As Well. I Feel Like He Knew The Menu Better Than The Back Of His Hand.  100% Great ! I Will Definitely Be Coming Back Here ! Thank You So Much!! From One Greek To Another. OPA !!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We've been eating here since their first location in Centennial Center. They've kept up the quality as they've expanded. It's become my favorite \"comfort food\" place, and now my family and my wife's family look forward to coming here when they come to town. The pomegranate chicken is a must-have if you've never eaten here before. Also love the mama mia's chicken, any of the skewers, the stuffed peppers... anything, really. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"If I could I would give this place 10 stars. Excellent Greek food, I had the tenderloin plate and it was delicious, not to mention the great service that Sheena provided to me. Im definitely coming back for more !"}
{"text":"My favorite Mediterranean restaurant in Vegas! I've tried both locations and they both had great service.  I highly recommend their Lamb/Beef Gyro Platter combo. It comes with delicious basmati rice,  a tasty, crisp Greek salad (probably the best I've had), savory lamb and beef gyro wrapped in a warm fluffy pita. I also recommend their falafel balls with the cucumber dill sauce. And you MUST get their baklava with a giant scoop of vanilla ice cream!!"}
{"text":"The best Greek food in Vegas. Always consistent, service is friendly and the place is always clean. The lunch special is the best. The owners come by and check if everything is perfect. We come here at least once a week. Opa!"}
{"text":"Pomegranate chicken!  You will not regret it!  We came here for lunch, so the price was very reasonable along with the portions.  Your tummy will be satisfied.

Service?  Top notch!

Parking?  Plenty!"}
{"text":"Great food!! Excellent service my mother and I came and ordered a salmon wrap and our meal was delicious!!! Thank you very much for such peaceful experience!! Best service!! Friendly atmosphere. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Really good food.  And yes it is like Pei Wei.  I just wasn't  overlly empressed with the staff."}
{"text":"Great place! My daughter had the children's gluten free pasta with marinara sauce and grilled chicken. It smelled so good and she said it was one of the best pasta dishes she had. Rhonda, the owner, came over and greeted us. She noticed it was our first time at her restaurant and she gave me a coupon for our next visit. She was so nice! The staff was helpful and wonderful. Lovely atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Loved it! The food and the service was great. What more can you ask for?! One of Las Vegas' hidden treasures."}
{"text":"I'm slowly becoming addicted to this place! The service is really great, and I'm in the service industry! Really great gyro meat, love the Greek salad and obsessed with the spinach humus.. It's my spot post yoga and great patio for lunch with friends!"}
{"text":"I've taken my friends & family here many times for dinner. The staffs are friendly and the food are delicious! Sometime when I don't want to make dinner I just take my wife here."}
{"text":"This is a relatively new casual Greek restaurant that has prospered during these difficult times by providing very good food at reasonable prices.  Ann ordered the spanakopita while I chose the pomegranate chicken.  Entrees include pita bread, salad and Greek rice.  This version of spankopita was denser than we are accustomed to, but very good nonetheless.  I have only had pomegranate chicken once before at Paymon's and this version was infinitely superior.  I had a coupon printed off the restaurant's website good for 2 free glasses of wine that the manager accepted along with a discounted gift certificate purchased at Best Restaurant Guide.  We closed out the meal by sharing a piece of the restaurant's award winning Aphrodite cheesecake with a baklava crust."}
{"text":"Yummy gyros! We always order the traditional gyro meal. It comes with so much food for only $12. The lamb is so flavorful. It comes with rice, pita slices, hummus, and a tangy Greek salad. I could eat here everyday! They even have a \"baby gyro\" kid's meal that my daughter loves. EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"delicious place but how come they are closed on sundays!!!! is when people needs a good restaurant open"}
{"text":"Service was great. I went here with my 90 year old dad and they took care of us.  Attentive waiters.  Food was okay, not amazing. Plentiful.  In a busy shopping area but parking was fine. Try the shrimp
Skewers.  I wasn't crazy about the falafel."}
{"text":"The food and service were both excellent.   It was our first time to this restaurant and our server was knowledgeable about the menu and had great recommendations for us.   Will definitely make another trip to this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I always get a take out order in between work and school. The staff is always friendly, the food is always great, and it's aways in the time quoted. Joe somehow knows my dad (but I never knew how) and we used to go to his other restaurant years ago when he was head chef. He is a very nice man. I trust his food."}
{"text":"Market Grille is one of my favorite restaurants period. Their mousaka, skewers of all kinds and dolmades are wonderful. I never even knew I liked pumpkin soup until I had theirs. The service is great and very family friendly. The live music on Friday nights is a treat and dining on the patio a charming experience."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good Greek restaurant on our side of town. This place exceeded our expectations. The service was impeccable and I give most of that credit to Shelley (hope I spelt that correctly) who gave us a breakdown of how the place worked and really made us feel welcomed. The food was like nothing we've had before and the variety was outstanding, unlike other Greek places we've been to, which is great when we come back. At the end of our meal she came back to ask us how our experience was and made us excited to return. I'd give it more stars if I could! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Thinking about the food here makes my mouth water. My boyfriend loves Greek food. We've gone to other restaurants, but never fell in love with the food. 

This establishment is one of two locations and family owned. If the owner is there, he will personally greet you to see how your experience is. 

I almost always order the 4 dolmades and Mamma Mia's Chicken! It is my favorite. Otherwise, the pomegranate chicken is another go to dish. And if we want to indulge a little bit, a cheesecake, rice pudding, or the baklava are amazing!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Mediterranean restaurant. If you want an authentic homemade Mediterranean cuisine this is your place. Their gyros are to die for. The service is prompt and the food is beyond the best. I've dine with them few times now and i think a well review is due. Their exceptional service is consistent. The servers are polite, patient and very helpful. I ordered their traditional gyro with hummus today, usually i do it with dill yogurt instead but i wanna try something different. Their hummus is really good but personally i prefer my usual yogurt, \"its a comment i did mention to my server when we were having a regular conversation.\" without asking my server, he brought me a yogurt dill sauce on the side for me to dip my gyro. Theres no words to say to compliment their service. I never saw the bottom of my glass. They kept refilling my drinks wothout me asking for it. And i think one of the owners of the place goes around greeting everyone making sure their guest are always happy and satisfied. You gotta try their dessert too. I love their tiramisu cheesecake, fluffy and ozzing with yumminess. This awesome cafe have the best food and service in town. If you're in NorthWest side of Las Vegas, NV. try this place, you wont be disaapointed."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh food.  We started with the lemon cilantro hummus.  OMY (Oh My Yum) was it good.  I love cilantro and it had a strong cilantro taste and burst of lemon.  I ended up dipping fries and my gyro in the leftover hummus.  I had the greek salad and gyro and my group split the fries.  Everything was super flavorful.  My dining companion had a coupon for a free baklava and although I'm not much for baklava I had a taste and it was good as well.  Can't wait to go back and try more from the menu."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch place; I go there several times per week.  Lunch special is only $9.25 for gyro, chicken skewer and one side.  Lots of gluten free and options (including pasta) and vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Very yummy chicken gyro. The ingredients were very fresh and Basmati rice was so yummy. I ordered on the phone and food was ready very quickly. The price for lunch was very reasonable and you get a lot for your buck. For a lunch special you have options and you also get a drinks. The location was very clean and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"This is a good homemade mediterranean restaurant. I had the traditional gyro with lamb and beef and you can choose from hummus or cucumber dill sauce inside the gyro. I can't wait to go back and try other entrees. They only have 2 locations in the valley. A must try restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is YUM!!! They provide a fantastic lunch special and are very generous with the portions. Good for Vegans, vegetarians and or your hearty meat eater!"}
{"text":"Great place unfortunately their lack of seating kept me from eating my lunch there today! You'd think if business is that good they'd be smart enough to expand ! Wouldn't recommend for lunch unless you can get there VERY early or have lots of time to waste!!!"}
{"text":"I travel about 80% of the time for business, and my preferred method of locating good eats is through customer reviews.  True to form, I found this little gem on Yelp and was delighted with the result!  I had a gyro platter paired with hummus, cucumber tzatziki and a Greek salad.  The veggies are incredibly fresh, just like Greece!  All other ingredients are deliciously homemade and made to order.  Even so, service is fast and friendly.  The owner was a total sweetheart and happened to be (wo)manning the register when I ordered.  She quickly realized I was from out of town and presented me with some complimentary pita bread and a coupon.  A delightful experience, I only wish they had a location closer to home!"}
{"text":"By far I would have to say this was the worst service I have experienced.  A couple friends of mine and I decided to eat here for lunch. We were asked if we had ever been in before, we replied that all but one of us had not and she had not been here for a very long time. 

We were explained to order off a board and then they would bring the food to us which was fine, the décor was very warm and inviting and did have almost an outdoorsy feel. Overall the interior was great. The guy who took my order was very informative, polite, and had extensive knowledge of their menu. 

I placed my order, then my 1st friend placed hers, and finally my 2nd friend placed hers. We sat down at a table. We were given our appetizer a few minutes after selecting our table, the hummus was ok, almost tasted like they used sour cream in it, not the best I have tasted but it also was not the worst. 

A few minutes later a younger girl came up to our table with 2 plates and just stared at me with a blank smile. It was really kind of uncomfortable. I was starting to think that she either could not speak, forgot how to speak, or was just memorized by our charming good looks, then she finally opened her mouth and I realized that all of the above were incorrect, she just did not really understand life or what was going on in it.  

She passed me my plate, passed the 3rd person hers, she then said \"enjoy\" and my 2nd friend, the one who placed her order 2nd never received her order. She spoke up and asked the dazed girl \"Are you bringing my order soon?\" The girl just looked at us with a glazed over look and flashed a half crooked smile , almost as to say I have no idea what you are talking about-I just work here or maybe am new and do not understand words kind of a smile and walked away. 

After several minutes this mindless girl emerged from what we believe was the bathroom and we tried to flag her down, she walked passed us and up to where the kitchen staff handed out the food. We noticed there were 2 more plates and assumed it was the 2nd friend's meal.  We again were wrong, it was the food of 2 patrons that had came in several minutes after we had sat down.  

Finally we flagged down Maria who was extremely rude and condescending and asked where the order was, we even flashed her the receipt. She question as if we really had even ordered anything for my 2nd friend and looked at her appetizer plate as if to say she already scarfed down her order. When she was informed that we are still waiting she snapped at us and told us that we were not on the same page as her and basically told us to settle down and did not understand what was going on, Apparently confusion runs rampant in this hole and the right hand has no clue what the left hand is doing at all! It is not even aware there is another hand. My 2nd friend asked if she could either have her money back or her order and Maria just stood there like a statue and glared as if my friend spoke to her in a foreign language. Extremely unprofessional, at no point in time did Maria ever say \"I am sorry for the mishap, let me figure out what is going on and I will be right back.\" We were made to feel like liars. 

She walked away with the receipt which we requested to be given back and took several minutes at the register, my 2nd friend finally had to walk up and ask what was going on. Maria snapped at her \"WE ARE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE!!! DO YOU JUST WANT YOUR MONEY BACK?!!\" Well no, she wanted to eat since we only have an hour lunch and the majority of it was wasted trying to figure out where the food was she had paid for, NOT ROCKET SCIENCE!!

Maria stated that she had nothing to do with this and she refused to apologize because it was not her mistake!!  I am sorry, but I would assume that the manager IS responsible for her employees and their mistakes! Maria asked \"Would you like an apology, because we are not on the same page!\" My 2nd friend said \"No, the way you are just staring at me with that confused look, makes me feel like you think I stole the food\" Maria just stood there for 10 minutes staring at my friend like an idiot. No refund was offered, but my friend was finally provided her order but was made to stand at the food line and had to walk her food over to our table. 

Upon leaving we asked for Maria's managers name and she was in shock like we would have the nerve to ask for this and again NEVER apologized for the crappy service. The best part is when she actually told us to have a nice day! I am sorry that I had actually gave a 20% tip at the beginning right after I placed my order.

The \"Beef/Lamb\" Gyro sucked, was the worst I have ever tasted, I would not recommend this to an enemy and the service sucks! Maria should not be dealing with the public at all."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! Best Greek food I've had. Prices aren't all that bad either for the quality of the food. The service is also outstanding. :) Definitely a must if you haven't tried it !!!"}
{"text":"My mom wanted to get some Greek and this was the spot to go to. I never had thIs style of food before here in Vegas so I was kinda worried. Putting all worries aside, one step inside I felt like I was in a home of a greeks family. Kaitlyn was our server and she was very sweet. She was really detailed in the specials and the house favorites. The food was delicious and filling. Very healthy choices to pick from, homemade, fresh, and creative. I will be back soon with more family and friends to enjoy this wonderful place."}
{"text":"This was very boring.  I didn't hate it, but I didnt love it.  I love gyros and Mediterranean food so I was disappointed with this one. Nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"The food here was good but the portion sizes aren't very filling. I loved the black tea & the lentil soup. The Greek salad was good but the chicken & veggie skewers were lacking in the flavor department. 

My biggest complaint is that although our server was very nice, she wasn't there very often. Also, the server that brought us our food gave us the wrong food & then continued to ask several tables if the food was theirs, until she finally got the right table. 

I'd give this place another try because overall the food was good & the prices weren't bad at all. Hopefully, the service will be more consistent next time."}
{"text":"This place is so great! I don't even know where to start. This is the 3rd time I'm here they are consistent with great service and food quality. I had the pomagranate chicken (signature dish), beef tenderloin skewers that were so tender and flavor full, moussaka, and the Mediterranean medley. Each one of these dishes were absolutely delicious, came to our table nice and warm, service was excellent, the server was very polite and helpful. Even the house wine rocks! They have daily specials. I highly recommend this place. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good food. I enjoy the gyros, and the stuffed tomatoes.  The hummus is very tasty too."}
{"text":"First time that I've ever written a Yelp review while still sitting at the table of the restaurant!

Yes it was THAT good! 

I had a small cup of their mushroom and pumpkin soup. Delicious and very unique flavors. If you love all things Thanksgiving, you'll enjoy this soup. I probably could've eaten it for dessert. 

My lunch special was chicken and veggie skewers and I opted to upgrade my salad to the Village salad (for $1.50) cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, feta and fresh herbs which gave the salad a bright flavor. 

I appreciated that the chicken and veggies had their own skewers as cooking times a different for those foods. I felt like this allowed for moist chicken and a good char on the veggies. 

Who can resist homemade baklava?!?!!!!

Get it. Get it. Get the baklava. You're welcome. 

Super friendly environment. Every employee that delivered my food, cleared my plates and refilled my tea were very cheerful. Compliments the entire experience"}
{"text":"We went for lunch on Friday and it was great.  The waitress was excellent and prompt and the lunch specials were outstanding.  The portions were huge, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I'M SOOOO HAPPY I FOUND THIS PLACE!!  I love Gyros!  I'm moving to Las Vegas soon and I was so sad that I won't be able to eat my favorite spot, Gyro King in Orange County.  I came here a few weeks ago to help my mom move and close out the sale of her home.  We were super hungry and I found this on here.  I was super excited to try it.  The portions was so filling.  I absolutely love it.  The service and food was excellent!  It was so good that we came two days in a row.  Our server from the night before remembered us. 

We ordered the Gyro Sandwich, Traditional Gyro Platter with rice and a small serving of hummus and pita.  Everything was delicious. 

The next day we ordered Gyro Sandwich plus $4 the rice and hummus and pita.  We added the Dolmades...hmm... We were not a fan of that! HA!  It was very citrusy...we both had a bite and that was the end of that.  LOL...never again.  

Service was awesome here.  When I move here, this is definitely is one of my regular spot. =)"}
{"text":"My husband and I only tried Greek food about 6 months ago and we now have lunch at Market Grille twice a month! Our favorite spot:) lunch specials are great and the price is good. Love the avgolemono soup!!! I tried to make it at home can't compare. Desserts are awesome. I have nothing bad to say about this restaurant:) Opa!!!"}
{"text":"My fave is the greek salad topped with gyro meat.  Free DIY refills on fountain drinks.  Our group of friends like to eat here whenever we're up North, because you order at the counter, the self-seat dining area is comfortable, they bring the food, and then leave you alone to chill and talk as long as you want.  Other places would hassle you for wanting separate checks, and give you the stink-eye for hanging out long after your meal.  We're making room for dessert!  ;-)"}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week! The food is always amazing at both locations and the service is great. They also have a separate take out door which is super convenient. Get the ya ya cookies! So good!!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have never checked this place out before!  The decor is great, and the food and service are amazing. My wife had the Pomegranate Chicken entree and I had the Stuffed Tomatoes entree. They were both excellent, and served to us very quickly. We will certainly be back again!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I have not been in sooner.... the food was amazing and the staff were just so awesome.... Sean the manager is just great and Cassie was very friendly..... will definitely be back again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pomegranate chicken is AMAZING! The dinner plates are a great deal. You get a salad, hummus, pitas, and rice with the entree and only around $10-12! Everything I have had is great, good service and atmosphere. Only wish there was one in the southwest!"}
{"text":"First of all...I DON'T EAT VEGETABLES!  With that said...Their Pomegranate Chicken Spinach Salad was PHENOMENAL.  It had the perfect compliment of flavors...feta cheese, pomegranate drizzle dressing, chicken, and spinach.  A MUST on their menu.  

The staff was friendly, professional, timely, and personable.  The ambiance was relaxing and the music offered a quaint Mediterranean feel.  

A RE-DO!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the fact that this place is a sit down restaurant that moves fast!  Food is very good ( some items I like more than others).  Service is excellent.  They offer a 'frequent diner' app.  There are many menu items to try.  Close to my new job so I'll be coming here often."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location twice (and a different location closer to my house several times).  The  decor is very pretty.  The staff were courteous and attentive.  There are televisions that feature the food.  On certain days/nights there is a live band (we were not there at that time but the set up was off to the side and details of the band were explained by the waiter).  The food overall was okay.  On one occasion I had them take mine back because the central area of the moussaka was not hot at all and I was concerned about eating it.  My spouse really likes the food, but I would describe it as being okay (not my first choice for greek food).  They have a few desert items as well; the cannoli being my favorite.  There are many menu items to choose from and after a certain time of day there is table service (you are seated and a waiter takes your order; typical restaurant format)."}
{"text":"I love their lunch menu! For $8.50 you get to pick a main dish, a side, and you also get a drink. 
I almost always get the same exact thing:
Mediterranean wrap with gyro meat and no tortilla wrap... Everything on it with yogurt dill sauce, a side Greek salad, and hot sauce on the side.
The wrap has rice in it and so \"naked\" it pretty much is like a Chipotle bowl but Mediterranean syle.. lol
The manager and cashiers are nice and they never complain or make a big deal about my special requests.
The gyro meat doesn't have any weird gamey taste and isn't oily. 
If you like lemon then definitely try their avgolemono soup, which has chicken, rice, and lemon! 
For lunch, you order at the counter and then they bring your food to the table (like Panera).

HOT TIP: Download the Epoxy App for the loyalty card. Every $10 you spend, gets you a stamp (they round up so you should get a stamp even for the lunch special) and every 10 stamps gets you a $10 credit."}
{"text":"I used to absolutely love this place back before they got their own building.  We went here often, and it was always amazing. 

Once they moved to the new (current) location, it seems they changed the recipes.  It's still consistent, but not as amazing as it used to be.  I don't know of a better Mediterranean restaurant in this area, it's not bad food at all, I just miss some of the old recipes.  I"}
{"text":"This place is decent, but nothing to rave about.  I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that comments on the poor taste of people in North Las Vegas.  How you can give this place anything over 4 stars is just beyond silly.  The great thing about this place is that it fills a niche that is totally unfilled in the area.  The food is generally decent, even if a little over priced.  The portions are generous depending on what you get.  Be sure to order extra tzatziki sauce for your gyro, as they are very stingy with it here.  The most disappointing part of this place is the atmosphere.  From the outside, it looked like a very nice, perhaps even romantic atmosphere, akin to Macaroni Grill or even the Olive Garden.  The minute I walked in, all of those expectations were crushed.  The environment is much more laid back and cheap than what it seems from the outside. It has an almost fast food feel.  The best thing that I can compare it to is Fazoli's Italian fast food chain for those of you that have been there. At any rate, it's a decent place, but certainly not anything above average."}
{"text":"Got a lamb gyro to go this week and it was so awesome!!  The pita bread was soft and chewy, the cucumber dressing was awesome, and the lamb meat was tender.

Their frequent diner card and 15% off coupons show that they really value their customer.  Cool environment as well if you choose to dine in.

Try it!!  Fast but quality Greek food!!"}
{"text":"My goto Friday lunch with the family.  A great local joint with an amazing array of delicious greek food!   Love the Traditional Gyro and Lentil Soup, the new hummus flavors are super yummy too."}
{"text":"I eat here everyday, literally !! I Order the pasta Giovanni. If it's your first time here I would recommend the pomegranate chicken. I stopped ordering because sometimes the chicken would be dry."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the atmosphere here, it
t was so welcoming and beautiful! The food was delicious! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We're back and this time we came just for dinner. Driving from Cali to Nevada and where we go for dinner ??.... Here. We came back to visit my family again and we said we have to come back to this place. This time we all switched up on the entrees. Pita bread served with all meals and we tried the minestrone soup and the Greek salad extra feta cheese with hummus . Try the Greek sauce and fries . Service is quick and the waitress was friendly ."}
{"text":"First time trying Greek food and loved it. I went with a group of friends and they as well enjoyed their time. Our waiter was really nice I diffently would want to sit in her section again. I told her about my nut allergy and she told me the items of desserts I could try. I went with the tirimisu cheesecake. I had to take the rest home but once i got home i demolished the cake. I regret nothing :)"}
{"text":"I have always been good with the serving staff but the food has been nothing to brag about. It's just OK."}
{"text":"After spending some time in Vegas we wanted to take our friends out to dinner away from the main strip and Market Grille Cafe fit the bill. We were pleasantly greeted and seated rather quickly. The ambiance was classy, yet it had a family feel to it. The waitress was a little abrasive at first but seemed to warm up to us as the night went on. The food was well presented and tasted delicious. if you like beer give the Greek beer Mythos a try and you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I love that this place is a family owned restaurant. Wife and I tried the Trio platter so that we could sample several different things. We also had a traditional gyro. Everything tasted quite good. Well we both agreed it's not something we will eat every time we' re in town but we will go back."}
{"text":"The food is really good, so my husband and I return frequently.  Plus, it's close by.  BUT, it has been three times now and I've asked for no onions in my wrap and they put onions in my wrap!  The first time, the OWNER told me I must have mistaken them for the red cabbage.  I am 1000% confident I did not mistake them (I think I can tell when my throat starts to feel tingly).  Plus, I frequently use red cabbage in my own cooking.  The owner still made us pay for the meal.  

The most recent time was a take-out order.  I must have said 10 or 20 times \"no raw onions\" in either of the two orders, and asked several, \"are you sure there are no raw onions?\" before I left.  As soon as I got home, I took a giant bite and behold- there were onions in both orders.  

Further.  Before you leave the take-out area, they quickly open the box to make sure the order is correct.  The server who opened the box saw that one of the wraps looked like it had fallen on the ground and was no longer a wrap.  Yet, he closed the box again as if I was going to take it.  They also forgot multiple things on my order and I ended up waiting even longer for the order to be refilled (45 minutes)."}
{"text":"This is a really good Greek restaurant with great prices and wonderful desserts. It used to have a fast food look and they recently converted to a full sit down restaurant which I think was a great idea."}
{"text":"Was craving a Greek Salad and some other Mediterranean fare, search Yelp high and low and picked this place try despite the spotty reviews. It is so close to my house I couldn't believe I haven't eaten here before.

Was eating alone so I decided to order to go and just chill at home to try out the food. Now I know most people are going to tell me this effects my dinning experience but whatever.. we are talking about the food here.

Ordered a Falafel wrap with a side Greek salad. I got it with the Tomato Basil wrap and their yogurt dill sauce. When I got home and started chowing down I was highly disappointed. The salad came with Balsamic dressing, yuck. The lettuce seemed grainy like it wasn't washed, and there was barley any feta cheese. The falafel was ok. I don't know if it was the sauce recipe or just the lack of it but the whole thing tasted really dry to me. 

Now after all this and being mad that I didn't go somewhere else I still want to go back and try the Combination Platter, and maybe something else. It's a strange reaction but my stomach needs to find a a near by Greek place that reminds of the places back in New York. 

So I will someday give it another try and maybe I will change my tune. We will see."}
{"text":"Freshest ingredients! Everything cooked to perfection $50. for the four of us with leftovers. Friendly staff and really clean."}
{"text":"Always good!  The service is awesome whether you're dining in or picking up a quick lunch.  It's very difficult for me to find a restaurant that I know will be good no matter when I go but this one fits the bill!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, one of my favs in the city, a bit pricy for casual dining."}
{"text":"The customer service and owner is great. The both times I've been here, everything has been on point. They have an amazing lunch hour to choose from.
I keep coming back for the pomegranate chicken. Definitely recommend anyone who is interested in Greek food to come here!"}
{"text":"My mom and I come in often for the lunch special. I always get a gyro with the basmati rice. If you haven't tried the baklava cheesecake you are missing out! I also really enjoy the saganaki appetizer. Mythos beer is good too! Service is always prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Food is excellent but service was kind of relaxed. This location has a much nicer setting than the Lake Mead store. But the food is the same and presentation is always nice too."}
{"text":"Market Grill, Durango

One Fri evening in mid-August, coming back after hiking on Mt. Charleston one Fri evening, my wife and I were hungry and thirsty. A quick check with Yelp showed a Greek restaurant nearby Durango off I-95. So, we happily rushed into Market Grill Greek Café for beers and dinner!

After settling down with a couple of Greek beers, (&3.5@, NOT BAD!), we began to notice something in the restaurant:

- It's spacious with high ceilings; has an airly, clean and comfortable decor; has a nice patio...

- Its TV continuously shows pics of theirGreek dishes, deserts, etc, and how they are prepared. It seems to us that this is the ONLY hint that Market Grill Café is a Greek restaurant. We did hear \"Oopa!\" a few times, but did not see any flaming cheese anywhere?

FOOD:
- We followed a couple ofYelpy recommendations and ordered the popular \"Chicken Parmegranate,\" \"Chicken Gyro\", anda \"Greek Salad\". The Greek salad was pretty tasty with lots of black olives; but the lettuce was too finely chopped. The Chicken Parmegranate was too bland, and the chicken not firm; Chicken Gyro needed salt and pepper to boost the taste. The dishes were not how we remembered as Greek cuisine would taste like as those served in Greek restaurants in Detroit, Chicago.... Well, perhaps, the regular Greek chef was not on duty that evening?

SERVICE:
- Our waitress was attentive and and helpful. [GOOD!] But, we did notice a couple of times when customers were waiting by the hostess station, but there was no hostess and the restaurant people just walked by WITHOUT greeting them, leaving them standing for a while! No one was busy at the time, as the place was pretty EMPTY! This is not a good practice! [BAD!] I was surprised that the customers did not turn around and leave the place!

HAPPY HOUR (3-6)
- $1 off drinks and appetizers. We were too late for the happy hour that evening.

{"text":"I really wanted to like this place; it's five minutes from my house. Unfortunately, Market Grille Cafe just doesn't have very good food. The prices are also pretty ballsy considering its a step up from a fast food joint. I felt really ripped off by the end of the meal.

No pita with the soup, salad and appetizer. (Why?) We had a lovely feta cheese appetizer that we just stared at until our meals showed up. When the pita finally made an appearance at the table, it was four tiny wedges on the plate with the entree. 

The avgolemono soup was pretty good; lots of chicken, not a lot of rice. The salad that comes with the entrees is also fine, just a little heavy on the dressing. Unfortunately, the starters were the highlights of the meal. 

 I actually had to spit out my one bite of spanakopita, it was THAT GROSS. It tasted as though it had been made days ago and had surprise inner layers of mushy phyllo. Stale and inedible; I'd have sent it back if my husband hadn't eaten it (I don't think he liked it either, but he's a 'clean your plate' type). 

The hummus and tzatziki were disappointing. Both had an off taste and didn't seem fresh. The filet skewers were pretty rare, rarer than I would have liked if they'd bothered to ask. The rareness wouldn't have fazed me if the meat had been fresh and of good quality, but, like much of what we ordered, it seemed as though it had been sitting around a few days. They're also selling what amounts to a lunch portion at other places at a dinner price. If you're going to overcharge for three bites of meat, it'd better be delicious, you know? I skipped dessert; they'd gotten enough of our money already. 

I may or may not come back here. I'm willing to believe they were having an off night and try ordering something else (never again for the spanakopita though, I'm nauseated just thinking about it), maybe a lunch special. In spite of their convenient location, Market Grille can't touch my other Greek spots."}
{"text":"This was my first time here . The staff was very attentive and friendly . The ambience was very nice . The restaurant was clean. I food was very fresh and wonderful ."}
{"text":"Tonight was one of the greatest meals of my life! I came with my roommate who I finally talked into coming and she was sure glad she did! We were in heaven as every bite from everything we had was made from the gods! The service was equally on par, admittedly it was a Tuesday and not their busiest night but we were treated like VIP's by both our waitresses, frequently checking on us, bringing more bread, more water, happily taking the time to answer our questions and explain the dishes and how they were all homemade recipe's from scratch. The pomegranate chicken was a 10! The Saganaki was a 10! The lemon chicken and rice soup was a 10! The salad was a 10! The pumpkin cheesecake was a 10! The homey elegant Greek ambiance was a 10! Heck, even the ice water was a 10! *(filtered unlike some other places.) We will definitely be back and I am still feeling good vibes from this place even though I'm stuffed. It was culinary perfection, and I can honestly say that this is one of the few meals in my life where a standing ovation would have been justified! Opa!"}
{"text":"It's clean and fresh flavors so usually we end up going here when we need something fast and just need something that isn't overwhelming.

Pomegranate chicken plate is the usual. I rarely get chicken breast anything because it's usually so dry and blah at places. It's juicy and lightly done up with a slightly sweet sauce. 

I'm surprised this location doesnt get as good reviews as Centennial on the food consistency. So far, we havent had anything off yet, but we normally don't go to this one.  We like how this one has booths which are more comfy than the small setup in the Centennial location. 

Is it the most authentic food around? Well, no....it's kinda light on the spices that generally I come to expect  distinctively present in Mediterranean fare. It's good food- just not what I come to associate when I want Greek home cooking but what I associate with light and fresh choices if that makes sense."}
{"text":"I think the best way to describe this place is consistent, fresh and clean eating. Nothing here is overly greasy, everything feels light enough that this isn't your guilty meal spot. If you have dietary restrictions or are gluten free, vegan, etc, they are very accommodating. There aren't many places up here I would say you could eat fresh, and this is a nice solitude. 

This used to be in the Centennial shopping in a small space, but they've upgraded to a sit down service restaurant just up the road. I much prefer it here since you're not bumping chairs with the table behind you. I didn't mind getting up to get my own drink and all before, but now they have servers here which makes sense for the space.

I have tried a few things on the menu, but I normally get the same things. With entrees you can go a la carte with just rice or a combo has with salad, pita and tzatziki or hummus. Their rice is seasoned and soft, the hummus is more liquidy and plainer than I like but I do like their tzatziki. Pomegranate chicken is always cooked right and juicy. Greek Trio has moussaka, patstitsio, spanakopita. I think overall those are decent versions, but moussaka is my favorite of the 3.Gyro plate/Vasilios plate gyros are soft and never dried out, comes with rice, salad, pita, tzatziki and hummus already. Gyro pizza is different, but good! Think of it as like a open faced gyro sandwich with tomato sauce as a base.  Combination platter is a appetizer but makes for a good vegetarian meal too with hummus, babaganoush, salad, lots of pita, and some falafel. I think their falafel here is just okay, they are sort've dense when I prefer a fluffier and moist inside.

Their cheesecake here is surprisingly good. They do a baklava crust instead of graham cracker so that little bit does it over the top. I get the pumpkin cheesecake usually. Baklava is decent, but not my favorite in town. 

People who work here are pretty friendly and generally attentive. It's a  family owned business and I like to support our locals."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  The place is kinda a hybrid between full service sit down restaurant and fast food, but it's pulled off nicely.  I do so love their Gryo salads and Gyro platters, they are huge and bring a smile to my face.  The Gyros are definitely the best in the area.  If you tip the wait staff they yell \"Opa!\", although the first time they did it felt like I was going to get into the Greek version of \"thunderdome\".  The food is a little on the pricey side but its delicious so I won't complaint.  Last time I was their I saw they have some kind of flaming cheese appetizer.  My inner pyro maniac is dying to try this dish, so I will definitely be heading back there."}
{"text":"AMBIANCE: 5 - Everything is prepared fresh which is refreshing. The restaurant is pretty homey now, like I'm eating in my Mediterranean grandma's place lol 

It has a great smell in the restaurant, like they just baked all the desserts and it smells like heaven! 

Place is pretty empty, which is a shame because the food isn't too bad! 

SERVICE: 5 - The service was great! the server was really nice and personable! she was patient and very attentive to our needs.

FOOD: 4 - I like my veggies and tried the spanakopita, which is baked well and tastes great! they put their salad as a side in most dishes, and I love it!!! 

Their Aphrodite's cheesecake is way improved! it's not as sweet anymore and I love it!! 

The food still has that fast food feel to it, I wish it had a more homemade taste! The cheesecake is perfect though! 

This is my favorite spot to go to for Mediterranean!! I always always get the skewers!

Local Specific info: their punch card is now an iphone app, so if you go a lot, download away!

You can order to-go!"}
{"text":"All homemade dishes and dessert, prices are very reasonable. The lamb skewer was excelent. Service was great, thank you stevie."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! The atmosphere is laid back and the decor is very warm and unique. We have only been here during dinner time, but we always receive table service (counter service must be a lunch thing). Every time we have been here, the servers have been super friendly and helpful. Rhonda, one of the owners, is always here and makes a point to stop at every table and chat. 
The food is delicious and very reasonably priced. 
Great service, great food, great restaurant!"}
{"text":"We ate on the patio because we had our dog with us.  The misting fans were the perfect bit of help in the sun, but not blasting in our face like some other misters can do.  The lunch menu was super affordable and very good!  Our very friendly waiter recommended the dill yogurt sauce for my gyro (I asked him, he didn't preach or anything) and it was fantastic!  Super friendly, affordable, delicious!  AND they have Dr. Pepper :)"}
{"text":"I got a groupon deal for this spot. I will def be coming back. I ate every single piece of my food down to the last piece of rice. I'm talking delicious. YUMMY IN MY TUMMY. Get in my belly status. 
Roomie got the Cabernet Lamb with potatoes. His plate was clean by the end. Heard no complaints
Friend got the pomegranate chicken w rice. Chicken was moist and the small bit i tried was amazing. I will definitely order   this the next I visit. 
I got the lamb skewers with rice. They cooked the lamb just right. not over done. Meat was not overly game. Seasoned nicely. I want more. 
Baklava - flakey goodness. one serving is pretty hefty. its a must share. 
Thank you groupon for the suggestion."}
{"text":"I was craving greek food, so i yelped, and this joint came up.. They had a groupon, bought it and went...  All the pictures looked great,, when i got mine i was very disappointed..  The pastisio,, was marginal,, very very small slice,, i wouldnt order it for a homeless person... The hummus,, not that good,, very runny, not impressed... The Gyro,, skimpy on the meat, sauce was not very good will not come back to this joint... Others may rave about it this place,, i did not like this at all... At least i only wasted 16 bucks for 30 bucks of food..."}
{"text":"We drove across town to try this place after hearing it was good. I used the check in offer and got 20% off our bill. I had the gyro platter and my husband had the beef filet platter. Everything was really fresh and very flavorful. My gyro platter was huge! I took home leftovers. The felt was really tender and not at all dry. I loved the hummus and pita. Well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! I love eating here or getting it to go! The falafel dishes, spanakopita and hummus are so yummy! They are also super friendly and nice in here, it really makes me love going back. :)"}
{"text":"I came in here for the first time recently and I am hooked!!! The Pomegranate Chicken is so so good and I wasn't even a fan of pomegranates before trying it! I have also had the falafel wrap and it's so full of flavor! The food is filling, but doesn't leave you feeling overly stuffed. Every employee I have met has been so kind and has answered all of my menu questions. The owners stop by and greet you as well if they are in. I highly recommend checking them out if you're craving flavorful, delicious food."}
{"text":"Our saganaki was floating in oil. The manager asked if we wanted another one and then charged us twice. We asked for kid's chocolate milk and it took 20 plus minutes for them to arrive.

Our table wasn't cleared and this was by far my worst experience here. I refuse to frequent a place with subpar service. It is atrocious to say the least. There are better places to eat in Centennial Hills."}
{"text":"I only went here once so far but I will definitely be coming back. I love Greek food so I had high expectations walking in and all my expectations were met if not succeeded. The waitstaff and the owner were super friendly and accommodating. It is definitely a family restaurant and they take pride in their food. I ordered the appetizer sampler as my meal and everything was great. The falafel was actually the best I have ever had. I also got the lentil soup which was amazing. My friend got the traditional gyro and really loved it. I also got moussaka to take home to my boyfriend. It's his favorite food and he said it was definitely one of the best versions he had too. I never give 5 stars on yelp but this restaurant more than deserves it! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good Greek/Mediterranean food. Yummy hummus, moussaka, etc. Great customer service as well!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and was hesitant to try this place, but decided it was worth a try. We got an appetizer plate with a variety of items and it was very tastey. We got a side of shaved beef and it was quite yummy. My husband lived in Cyprus and has cravings for proper Mediterranean food as it is hard to find. He said this was pretty good for the food that's aimed at western palettes. We will definitely be making a return."}
{"text":"We were able to make it back to Market Grille Cafe!   They have reasonably priced food with great flavor! 

I ordered the Lamb Souvlaki :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/market-grille-cafe-las-vegas-2?select=4Ed3hSUDwl8zGFTs-J6d-w#DFhsDHCaP9FPXyGf8uaqRw

Which is marinated and grilled, and sitting on Basmati rice, greek salad, Yogurt Dill sauce, and pita bread. Everything was yummy here, especially the Lamb which was not gammy at all, and packed with flavor!  I actually ate most of the salad too, even though i don't really eat lettuce.

Also tried the Filet Tenderloin :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/market-grille-cafe-las-vegas-2?select=4Ed3hSUDwl8zGFTs-J6d-w#uD-65l9o86fQRrA16IkBhQ

Which is also marinated and grilled, sitting on Basmati rice, greek salad, humus and pita bread. Pretty yummy too, but I really recommend the Lamb here!  I think it was cooked medium, and had plenty of juices inside.

Also, don't forget to \"check in\" on Yelp for 20% off your order! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I come here for lunch all of the time and we love it. The pomegranate chicken is the best!"}
{"text":"Easily the best place I was fortunate to eat at near Vegas!  The food is simply outstanding - I like to have the Falafel Wrap with Greek Salad. The Falafel is perfectly seasoned, and the wrap well composed.  Salad dressing tastes as if it was made in house (the video propaganda on the in-dining room TVs would certainly suggest so) and is delightful. 

Service is friendly and attentive, and I can't wait for my next opportunity to dine here!"}
{"text":"A GREAT takeout experience! I can't wait to dine-in. I had the falafel balls, spinach salad and the HIGY recommended pumpkin cheesecake, the fact that it's a family recipe and they use baklava for the crust!! It's absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS!!! Utterly delicious!!!! Everything is wonderful, this will for sure become one of my frequent spots to grab a bite!"}
{"text":"I really want to give it 3.5 stars, but I'll round up. They have a great lunch special- $8.50 to build your own combo, with choices of pomegranate chicken, gyro, wrap (with choice of meat or falafel) or chicken & veggie skewer and you also choose your side- rice, salad (house or spinach), fries or any soup. 

Customer service was great. The establishment is super clean and you can even watch them make your food if you'd like. They had gluten free, dairy free, nut and egg free options available. Good thing, because T Money was with us. Husband got a gyro of course, with a house salad. Looked great with a lot of meat. He ate it all. T and I ordered the chicken skewer. I ordered with a side salad and he got his usual fries. The chicks skewers were fantastic. And our food was brought out very quickly, which is always appreciated when you have a youngin' with you. 

I took off a star (and a half) because the allergy friendly options are really, really limited. The different hummus options sounded great, but they all had dairy in them. The falafel wasn't marked as gluten free either... Womp womp. I would go back again if we were in the area and in the mood."}
{"text":"I tried this place more than once to make sure it wasn't just me! Not a fan because I feel like the food lacks authentic Greek flavor. The Spanikopita and rice was cold and had zero flavor when I ordered it. The only item I actually enjoyed here was the Tabbouleh. I personally feel like they're whitewashing authentic Greek flavors to Americanize their food. Big mistake! Not sure what's in the Basmati rice but it's not Greek nor is it Indian. It's just full of herbs...no lemon flavor at all. And for the price the servings should be Greek size not one tiny piece of Spanikopita, dry rice, and a head of lettuce which the core should be removed first. I'll stick to eating at Yassou Greek Grill Cafe because the food is more authentically Greek!"}
{"text":"We've been told about this place by multiple friends.   My wife and I finally came here for lunch with the family.  3 of us got the chicken skewers and I got the pomegranate chicken salad with a bowl of the pumpkin mushroom soup.  Everything was super tasty and great service.  We also tried a couple different Greek beers.  Very satisfying experience.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant became a favorite for my husband and I! The food is delicious and the staff/service is great! My husband spent some time living in Greece and his standards for greek food are high. That said, Market Grille Cafe met his expectations! Worth stoping by!"}
{"text":"Got the traditional Gyro and chicken skewer plate.  I'd go for the Gyro over the skewer but both were pretty decent.  Not a fan of their hummus and the Greek salad was just ok.  Rice was good though."}
{"text":"Place is consistent with food served. Close to my house, so I go here often. Mildly upscale enough to not see people eating with their pajamas on, but not too fancy where you cant go in gym clothes.. Love the skewers and humus.... Family that owns it seems to keep it pretty tight... the grandmother is always up front watching the staff, and the grandson is cooking in the back... terrible choice in baseball teams (Yankees) but all the same love this place. Will go here anytime I'm invited. Only drawback, is the to go staff seems to struggle keeping things together as everybody else."}
{"text":"So I went back again after probably 3 years, due to a hankering for Greek food since I was in the area. This time, I ordered their Spanakopita to see if the recipe has changed. The presentation was exactly the same but this time, it tasted great! The pastry was flaky and it had the right amount of saltiness. It looked kind of like a spinach lasagna. It was over a bed of rice pilaf. I did not care for the rice, it was lacking flavor and moisture. I also ordered their pumpkin cheesecake. Way too sweet. Even sweeter than the ones I order at the Cheesecake Factory. I would say 3.5 stars this time around."}
{"text":"Very fast food Greek version. All the food was dry and a poor attempt at Greek food"}
{"text":"Market Grill is like an Outkast song: so fresh and so clean. However, don't expect them to actually be bumpin' Big Boi and Dre on their subs. First, I don't think they have subs, and second, their speakers are reserved for Greek tunes. The opa tunes add to a festive, comfortable, complete atmosphere. By complete, I mean that every little detail here is oozing Greekness. From the moment you walk in, you know that the owner takes their business seriously. I like it.

Before placing your order at the counter, you can peruse the giant menus. On these super-sized menus I discovered one of my all time favorite things to order at a Mediterranean restaurant: a combination platter! Yes, I know: very authentic. It is prefect for indecisive me, as I don't know whether I want hummus, falafel, tabouleh, baba ganoush, dolmades, or a Greek salad. Well, I do know, that I don't want dolmades, but the nice lady let me get more falafel instead. At $10 and change, it was less expensive than the other place in town where I had seen a similar offering, so I decided to go for it!

Everything was fresh, and I really enjoyed the baba ganoush and hearty lentil soup (not part of combo platter, but part of husband's order). The pita was warm and soft. The other items were good, but not amazing. The falafel were a bit salty, but tasty. However, they were odd. They seemed almost as if they had been baked, not fried, and they were a little small. I enjoyed the flavor, but not necessarily the texture.

Little bonus items include filtered water, clearly marked Gluten-free and vegetarian options, and a frequent diner card. Get punches for each $10 you spend, and after 10 punches, get $10 off. 

All in all I think the complete package is a keeper. I might not rush back for falafel, but it is the kind of place I would be happy to take my Southern mom to order some flaming cheese."}
{"text":"I just noticed that this place had opened and did pulled a u-turn to go try it out in the hopes I might get another first review. Once I got in I was a little confused because I didn't realize it wasn't a sit down and order type place. Instead you go up to the counter place your order, take a seat, and your order comes out to you. So I start looking over the menu I see the familiar mediterranean fair, but I notice a difference. They make their hummus and baba ganoush with yogurt. Instant turn off.

Despite this I decide to give the place a chance and I order a vegetable skewer and plato's potatoes. Turn's out plato's potatoes is just french fries with another name. I think ate two or three and gave up. The vegetable skewer was pretty decent and actually had a hunk of peach in it, which was a nice twist. Unfortunately that was not enough to make up for everything else."}
{"text":"The lamb gyro was delicious. The shredded lamb m at had great flavor and was juicy. The humus was also tasty. 

Service was quick and friendly during the lunch hour. The owner was nice and friendly. 

The atmosphere was nice, but a little on the busy side.

I like ordering up front and taking a number back to the table. This eliminated the need for a server which was nice."}
{"text":"We got off the freeway passing by Las Vegas and found the perfect lunch spot. This is the outback steakhouse of Greek Food, meant in a totally positive way! Terrific and fun decor, friendly staff and wonderful food.  We had lamb slouvaki Gyros, scrumptious. Owners and staff were welcoming and very friendly. Very clean restaurant. Recommended!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place for its Greek/Mediterranean selection. I've been a customer for about 7 years and nothing is very remarkable about it, but nothing is necessarily bad either. I think I've just been here so many times and I'm used to the menu. Would like to see them change their menu and add some new things perhaps."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites. The owner of the business has come by several times to see how things were, and is a very nice guy. This business is family owned. The food is wonderful! I have ordered just about everything off of the menu and haven't had a bad apple yet. The Spanikopita is one of the best I've had, and the rice and hummus that accompany most dishes are delicious! If you order the entree, there is easily enough food to make a second meal out of leftovers! The decor/atmosphere is fun and relaxing - a great venue for family meals or casual lunch with friends. They serve alcohol and their prices are pretty good. What more could you ask for? ....oh, perhaps a vegetarian/vegan/gluten free menu... yep, they have that too!"}
{"text":"Superb Greek Restaurant.  Authentic home style Greek creations complete with a flaming appetizer.  Lunch specials are below $9 and are 3 course + drink with plenty of food; i.e. Gyro, Mediterranean wrap, or Pomegranate Chicken...  Beyond reasonable.  Decor is fab.  Great atmosphere of the old world.  Full menu and super staff make this a must visit Cafe."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff , amazing food ! We were greeted right away at the door - and the hostess cleaned off a booth for us and sat us within a minute. We had multiple girls who worked there stop by and ask if we needed anything. I got the eggplant Parmesan - it was amazing. We regretted not getting the appetizer they are known for - the Saganaki. It smelled amazing when they brought it by to other tables. Overall great experience , would definitely go back."}
{"text":"So I did give this place a second chance and was disappointed again. I ordered a sirloin kabob which comes wth a veggie kabob and rice.
 the entire plate was bland. Rice felt like it was uncle Ben's."}
{"text":"We usually go to the Durango location. But had the same quality experience here too!! We will be back . Thanks MGC!!"}
{"text":"OUR FAVORITE!!!! Wonderful food and service
The eggplant parm tho!!!!
From the second you walk in you are taken care of , management works as hard as the employees and it shows. Clean place , always a great experience"}
{"text":"Traditional Greek Cuisine

Hummus and Salads are great here!   I go here about 3 times a month, the big salads are a fav.  Pomegranate chicken salad is a bit over priced, I learned to make this at home.  

GO GREEK!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent!! I had the Mediterranean wrap, lentil soup, and tea.  Great lunch after my hike at Mt. Charleston. I was seated and served in a timely manner. I would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"This was my third time eating at Market Grille Café with the hubby.  The verdict: we're fans! This family-owned restaurant is well decorated to showcase Greek culture and food. The Greek music playing in the background and occasional cries of \"Opa\" by the staff make the dining experience feel more authentic.  

My personal favorites thus far are the platos potatoes,  $4.25, which are served with a taziki sauce and garnished with feta cheese and seasonings, and the stuffed tomato entrée dish for $11.75.  The stuffed tomatoes are packed with flavor and have some serious weight to them. I was only able to finish one! The tomatoes are served with a small salad,  rice, and pita bread with hummus.  

Our server was super friendly and the wait time for our food was reasonably short. On this particular visit we happened to have a Groupon,  so we got a delicious meal for about $25 after everything.  Groupon or not, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Items Selected:
Traditional Hummus served with Pita Bread

Falafel on a bed of Lettuce with Hummus
Gyro Meat Side
Greek Trio - Spanakopita, Mousaka, and Pastitsio with Basmati Rice

One of two locations for a restaurant frequently named Best Greek Food by a notable local publication, Market Grille Café on West Lake Meade Boulevard was a spontaneous selection for Friday dinner after alternative plans fell through for unrelated reasons, the space whose name has fooled more than one into assuming it some sort of grocery store serving up a great dinner for three at a price far lower than much of its competition.

Located in the same shopping center as Panera, The Cupcakery and several other stores, entry to Market Grille Café sees patrons greeted by an open kitchen and homey confines as the menu spins Mediterranean by way of Greece and Italy, a smaller lunch variety and happy hour specials offered for those dining earlier in the day while more substantial options are reserved for full table service later in the evening.

Certainly more Athenian than Roman, though the similarities between dishes like Mousaka and Lasagna should seem fairly obvious to most, it was with an in-training server that the evening got under way as Iced Tea and Water were served to those at the table, the place fairly busy for 7:00 on a Saturday evening with all sorts of ages, genders and races represented in the crowd.

Encouraged to order in courses, most everything but the warmed Pita reportedly made in-house, it was with $5.50 small orders of Hummus next to creamy Eggplant puree with Garlic that the meal got started, the former a bit thinner than most of those previously tasted but at the same time full of flavor while the Babaganoush was far more chunky with a slight bit of smokiness left to linger in the mouth.

Not particularly wanting to over-order, the low prices actually quite deceiving for large plates when compared to the likes of Hummus Factory or Mykonos in Sun City, entrees were limited to just a trio of Greek favorites plus a few 'sides' including tender Gyro Meat and a quartet of \"Greek Meatballs\" (as described on the menu,) the Golfball sized Falafel our meal's only dud as ground Chickpea Fritters lacked any particular flavor on their own, save for that of the Oil.

Impressed by both the layered eggplant Mousaka with rich Beef Ragu, Spanakopita also quite nice with sheets of Phyllo interspersed by Spinach and springy Cheese, Pastitsio unfortunately seemed to be a bit overwhelmed with Cinnamon that completely overwhelmed both the Noodles and the other ingredients, far better bites found in two desserts including a generous slice of Baklava with plenty of Nuts and Honey plus a bowl of chilled Rice Pudding that embraced the grains texture rather than acting to completely hide it.

**** One of the more traditional Mediterranean menus in town, the limited Italian options seemingly just there because they are easy to make from ingredients commonly used in Greek cuisine, Market Grille Café offers good food at a fair price with plenty of vegetarian or more healthful options in an atmosphere that family friendly, but still nice enough to qualify for date night."}
{"text":"Today was my first time to Market Grille Cafe and it was fabulous! I went in around lunch time and it was pretty busy but our food still got to our table pretty quick. I ordered the veggie and chicken skewer and it was amazing! The whole time I was I eating I was wondering why I had never been here before! They also have an amazing lunch special for $10, definitely something to take advantage of!
The food was also so fresh and delicious. After we had finished eating we had decided to order one of their cheesecakes and it was quite original but extremely delicious. To top it all off, the service was impeccable. I look forward to eating here again!"}
{"text":"This was one of the most fun places to eat at. I'll definitely keep coming back here. The service was awesome,
And the food was exquisite."}
{"text":"They have great deals for lunch! I got the veggie wrap and a side village salad. It was tasty, but I asked for extra feta and was charged $1. If you look at my picture I don't see enough feta to be charged an extra dollar, so that was annoying because I don't think you should even be charged for that. Also, my salad has only 3 olives. The servers are very friendly and the atmosphere is nice. Also, as a vegetarian this is a great place to go with numerous options. On the menu it also specifies which items are gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan which I think is very helpful!"}
{"text":"I started eating here cause I saw the beautiful chiseled Greek Family Billboard near my exclusive northwest condominium unit. Their beauty drew me in for a mouth watering Greek extravaganza. I suggest the gyro with Plato's Potatoes (fries). Get it classic style. Ring the bell on the way out for a sweet Greek siren"}
{"text":"Really love this place.  A favorite in the Centennial Hills area."}
{"text":"Food is fabulous.  I usually go with the gyro platter or gyro salad.  Only down-side is they are closed on Sundays so the family can rest. 
The food is also priced great for the portion and taste.  Never had a bad experience here.  Love it."}
{"text":"Did Jesus make this food? 

Haha. First time here & the food is absolutely tasty! And this soup that I'm having is hands down sooooo good I should have ordered a large. It has rice, chicken and a lemon taste. 

For my entree, I ordered the chicken kabob thing. And again...didn't disappoint me at all. 

Everything is home made so it's definitely going to be my new go to restaurant for Greek food! LOVE LOVE LOVE!

Customer service is great as well, everyone is very nice!"}
{"text":"Food was great and prices reasonable. Food was made from scratch. Server was attentive and quick. Will be going back again."}
{"text":"I go here at least twice a week food is always great no matter what i order i always recommend to anybody who wants a great meal. Service just as good."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Service was good. Got a traditional gyro with rice and pomegranate chicken with a greek salad. All on the lunch menu. Very affordable around $9 for each entree. Both entrees were so good for a hot summer day. I will definitely be returning, maybe to dine in next time."}
{"text":"Hmmm how to put this... Delicious. The menu is easy to read and the servers are happy to explain the different options. I went with the Lamb and beef gyro on pita bread. You also have options for your pita bread of wheat and some other options. The Lamb and beef were fresh, the dill sauce was refreshing and wasn't overpowering. And they packed in the meat. The hummus was great and on par with other establishments. 
A little weird that you order then they bring it to you. Would be better if you ordered at your table.
Ohhh the desserts. I went with Aphrodite's cheesecake. It was huge with a baklava crust. Damn a great combination and delicious."}
{"text":"Have made three trips to this establishment, each time it gets better. I don't their is a bad thing on the menu. My fav is the Filet Tenderloin Kabob platter.
Comes with a veggie kabob, rice and greek salad..Yumm.. Hummus is very tasty as is the pomegranate chicken salad. Restaurant has taken on quite a following some nites it can be quite crowded.  If you like something different give this place a try, you will just keep coming back."}
{"text":"We had dinner at this restaurant tonight. It was the 3rd time here and as usual the food was delicious. Our waiter David was very attentive and we were pleased to have him servicing our table. This is at the W Lake Mead location."}
{"text":"Very good Greek food, gyro amazing, service possible the best ice ever had, extremely satisfied"}
{"text":"We really enjoy Market Grill Cafe. The food quality, atmosphere and service are top notch. Whether your craving Greek or Italian, they have you covered and you won't be dissatisfied."}
{"text":"They apparently close whenever they want and don't post it online so you can get dressed and drive there in the freezing cold just to have a sign on the door saying they're closed. Incredibly rude."}
{"text":"Stopped in for late lunch. Mostly couples enjoying a nice relaxing Greek lunch. Saganaki is awesome. Had the Gyro platter; very good, but have also had better.  Wife truly enjoyed her chicken kabob. Atmospher was nice and comfortable. Nice wines.  Very good lemon rice soup, and pita bread is awesome. Will definitely return to try their world winning chicken dish. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place close to home. My kids aren't big fans of Greek food so I ventured here with a friend. My friend that I went with is by far the pickiest eater I've ever known. Her son had tried the pomegranate chicken and raved to her about it. We went on a busy weekend in between shopping. My picky friend wouldn't let me order a drink until she was absolutely certain she wanted to eat there. Lol. I assured her the pomegranate chicken was got good reviews here so she would be safe. She ordered that in a lunch combo. I ordered the gyro and salad lunch combo. The waitress was very patient through my friend's questioning of the ingredients she would be getting. Can I just say the service here is amazing. My drink never went empty during a packed lunch. My friend loved her moist grilled chicken. What a relief! My gyro was moist as well and the tzatiki sauce packed a savory punch. My only gripe is more of personal preference. I like the crispy pieces of gyro meat, salty and crunchy. The gyro meat here is like a moist slice of freshly cooked gyro meatloaf. It's delicious nonetheless but I'm big on texture and I missed that in their gyro.  The baklava was spiced generously and the sweet taste wasn't overwhelming the nutty cinnamon notes. I'll be back to try more of the menu for sure. :)"}
{"text":"While this place is a bit pricey, the food, and service was definitely above average.  Portions are of decent size, employees are friendly, and all of us enjoyed our experience. Good food, good flavor!  I wish they had one in or close to Henderson.  Maybe next year."}
{"text":"This place was great! We walked in and were greeted immediately. The atmosphere and decoration of this small restaurant was fantastic. They have a huge menu that shows if things are vegetarian and gluten free (which I thought was cool even though I'm neither). We ordered a beef/lamb gyro, a large greek salad with gyro meat, and falafel. The total came to about $26.00 which is pretty pricey. But the food was amazing so we felt that we could justify it. The gyro and the salad were large and very tasty but the falafel was too salty for our tastes. I highly recommend this place but be prepared for the prices.

Ps: On our way out we ordered a slice of the aphrodite cheesecake and a small order of canoli's .... both were to die for!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Love their food :) The gyros are yummy but the pomegranate chicken is by far my favorite :) salad is always fresh and the pita bread and hummus are divine! Love!"}
{"text":"Big craving for falafel and we stopped in to try this place out. Not very busy for dinner time, greeted quickly and asked if we'd been before, so the wait staff suggested we look over the menu first and then place our order. 

We got an order of falafel, it comes with eight pieces and hummus. Very crispy and good! I also got a wrap, pomegranate chicken. It was pretty moist, served with lettuce, cuccumbers, tomatoes, onions, basmati rice, feta cheese, I got the yogurt dill sauce with a side greek salad, very good. 

Big portions, fresh, friendly service, a good meal."}
{"text":"New to Las Vegas from LA and dining out while our frig is being delivered.  Made it a point to come here tonight and wasn't disappointed at all.  In fact during the introduction of MGC's history and food preparation my mouth just started watering.  I chose the Lamb Roast Cabernet and really the best lamb (pulled for that matter) I've ever tasted in my life.  Reasonably priced and their atmosphere with live music is just made my evening.  Strong tips to the musician and MGC as it was a good introduction to how Vegas suburbs is so mellow.
Definitely coming back to check out the rest of the menu since they're only 5 minutes away from my new home.  
MGC.  Did I say MGC just beat out the Persian way of cooking lamb.  Well, I did now."}
{"text":"Walkin - browse menus on wall - order with nice cashier:) - sit with the number they give you and wait for food!"}
{"text":"This place is a little gem in vegas they have amazing food and there desserts  you will die amazing, the staff is super sweet and nice love this little places decor is so cute makes you feel your in another country for a min."}
{"text":"In two words: Fresh and flavorful. 

This is by far my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in Vegas. Service is always fast and friendly. The chicken skewer entree, stuffed peppers, pumpkin cheesecake, and cannoli are some of my favorites. Their entree meals are very fulfilling and reasonably priced too; included with the entree of choice you get pita with hummus, Greek salad, and rice pilaf. Plus they use fresh ingredients with lots of herbs and spices for flavor. It's one of my go to take out spots."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to the Durango location for years now. There are several reasons that we keep coming back.

First the staff, a family owned and operated business, they do a great job in ensuring you are taking good care of. I feel that once the team gets to know you, they basically know what your regulars are and will ask \"your regular\"? The team is always checking on you and ensuring small things like ensuring you drink glass is never empty, asking if your food is prepared correctly all while able to have conversations. 

The food is always great. We have had several different dishes from pasta, steak and chicken and have never been disappointed. Food is prepared fresh and is always brought out hot. I feel the prices for the food are good and honestly we are always bring home leftovers. I would recommend the Gyros, they are awesome and remind me of my trip to Santorini. 

The store recently went thru a renovation, and thou I miss the pictures of Santorini (Sorry Joe), they  did a great job updating the restaurant giving it a warm inviting feeling . What I think is unique is they have videos playing of highlights of the activities the restaurant is involved with. 

If you on the fence about trying, I would highly recommend this local gem."}
{"text":"Had an hour to kill and needed to eat. There were a number of options within the plaza but I fancy Greek cuisine. Had the lunch special and it was so good! $10 and it included a drink. Waitress even gave me a coke to take with me. Great service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"I'm a little embarrassed I have passed by but never noticed this place until a couple of weeks ago. Now last night I went here on a date night. I love the decor of the place. They try to do a modern Greek. The tables even have pictures under the glass I assume of Greece.

Now to the food. They have a Trio platter which is perfect so I can try 3 dishes most greek/med food places do. The Spanakopita was good. It consisted of spinach, feta & romano cheese, layered & baked in a buttery filo pastry. I love the flaky crust. The Mousaka was just like I have had at so many places which isn't a bad thing as it tasted great. It consisted of ground beef, eggplant & potato casserole, baked in tomato sauce cheese. Topped with a cream and grated cheese sauce. The Pastitsio which I had never had before was macaroni pie, baked with ground beef & tomato sauce with some cinnamon & nutmeg. It was really good. I got the entree so I had a Greek salad with it as well and it was fresh. The herb rice had a nice spice flavor to it. I'm not a hummus fan but boy this hummus was good with the fresh pita bread.

For dessert we decided on the Dolce Nannie which is 3 of their desserts. We chose the Canoli, Pumpkin Baklava Cheesecake, Stellas Honey Cake. Canoli was like any canoli and that's not bad because it was good. The winners were the pumpkin baklava cheesecake and stellas honey cake. Perfect sweetness!

Service was excellent. The waitress seemed to know the perfect time to show up and ask to fill our drinks. She even offered to go boxes for the little leftovers my girlfriend had.

I give Market Grille Cafe 4 stars for such a great experience. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, and great service. Wish I could have tried a dessert, but was so full from the appetizer and entree. My friend ordered the appetizer, not sure what it was called, but it was melted cheese in olive oil and came with pita bread. If your a cheese fan I highly suggest it. The atomsphere was nice and laid back, if it was a bit cooler outside would have liked to sit out on the patio."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Mediterranean/ Greek food this is the place for you. I come here almost every weekend and am never disappointed. I usually stick to the chicken skewers with hummus and the pomegranate chicken wrap. Both are fantastic. Don't skip dessert!! The pumpkin baklava cheesecake is probably the best thing on the menu.  Service is great too, the owner is usually present and is always so welcoming as well as appreciative of her customer's business."}
{"text":"Mediterranean food is one of my favorites and this place has pretty good options for now... I say that because I want to go to Greece one day and after I've had the real cuisine, I will be able to determine what's the true flavors of the country. 

My favorite here is always the Traditional gyro or platter. I like that they have a lunch special which includes a gyro or wrap and your choice of filling, traditional , chicken, falafel or veggie. choice of salad, fries or basmati rice, and a drink all for $9.95

I've been here for dinner and had the trio with the Moussaka, Pastitsio, and spanakopita, the servings were smaller than I expected, as I was sharing this meal between the 3 of us so that we could have a taste and that's basically what we had  each was a bite. Although we did order a greek salad and an appetizer of hummus and pita. 

The aphrodite's  cheesecake was good. Basically we were watching the video on the screen which showed how they were making it and on the recommendation of the worker we ordered it. It was very interesting to have the baklava crust. I would get it again if I have  any room that is. 

staff is always friendly here, you get greeted when you arrive and when you leave and they shout \"Opa!\" when the food order is up."}
{"text":"It's ok. Market Grille Cafe is a simple family restaurant with overpriced greek food. They used to be more affordable, but as they've become popular over the years the prices have gone up. Unfortunately, the quality didn't go up with it. 

The only thing I've enjoyed here was the hummus trio w/ pita bread. The offer some pastas, gyros, etc. The items were simply ok. Nothing above and beyond what we've tasted in the past from other Greek restaurants. 

Service was good and the staff is friendly. The decor in the place is open and it's interesting to see the chef's in the kitchen cooking up a storm. 

I would not be coming here again though."}
{"text":"Yuuummmmy. We have passed this place on several occasions and finally decided to stop and have dinner here. So good! We will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Loooove. Had sampler, gyro, and to die for cheese cake. Ate all of it, even though I should've stopped!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised by my lamb gyro. It tasted completely unseasoned- even bereft of salt. Maybe I'm spoiled by having already tasted the best gyro in the world (from Cleveland's West Side Market), but I expected a full flavor experience here.  I think I was fooled by the care that went into the design of the restaurant, which gives it a faux-cultural flare. Unfortunately, there was not even faux flare in my gyro.  

Boo!

(A tip for those who do like this place: check in to Yelp BEFORE you order- you may get a coupon!)"}
{"text":"It has taken me awhile to review this place. I didn't want to give it a review while peeved. But this place has peeved me each time, yet, I still return because the pita and lemon cilantro hummus is my addiction and it offers such a great lunch menu. It definitely beats having to drive a way for Mediterranean food and I always double thumbs up for that! 

We used to eat here when they were back at the centennial shopping center area, and at the time I was not as impressed. However, I can honestly say they have greatly improved. Their pomegranate chicken is always tender and juicy. Although, I don't specifically order that for myself...I always can't help but to take a bite off my kids plate. 

Their veggies are always so fresh and crisp so I appreciate that especially because I'll order a wrap or gyro. Their gyros are usually stuffed as I find myself struggling to monster bite into it. Lol. Their Platos potatoes seem to be just the frozen store.bought fries...but that's okay because they season it well and the dip that comes with it is rather simple.but good! 

My only gripe that leaves me.annoyed is for the most part...service is very slow especially during lunch time. My husband works nearby so we like having lunch dates here and I have to go there first then do the text of I just ordered come.on up. We have gone for dinner and I was pretty irked at how.slow and seemingly neglectful the waitress was. She apologized because she had a lot of tables, but I mean...we were there before it got chaotic. From the look on everyone else's faces, I'm sure they were thinking the same thing. It's cool...I get it.

Other than that...yeah, good place to get your Mediterranean fix without doing the journey somewhere else! Definitely recommend! Kid and stroller friendly!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were staying nearby at the JW and wanted some casual, local food. Found this among many other Mediterranean/Greek places in the area but had to come here due to the #foodporn. DID NOT DISAPPOINT. Sweetest staff on this planet, adorable appropriate decor, and delicious food full of flavor. We now have a new favorite place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I just ate here again recently during lunch time and it was a much better experience. None of the previous problems from the first visit reoccurred. The food was good, the service was prompt, and everything came out quick. I thought the Aphrodite cheesecake was a little overhyped. I felt that the regular baklava was much better."}
{"text":"Meh. The gyro stew is great. But everything is WAYYYYY overpriced. Way. And the portions are not fabu. At all. 

For the price of this food I can slay a lamb myself and get that carnal feeling I love. No thanks."}
{"text":"My options are limited being a gluten-free eater.  They gave a solid selection, including GF pasta.  

I had the Greek salad with grilled chicken.  Yummy!  In addition, I had the Hummus apoetizer.  A little too spcey, but tasty.

My bro had the pumpkin soup.  Whoa! I could smell the cinammon aroma, big time.  He said it was wonderful.

Looking forward to taking my husband, he loves greek food"}
{"text":"Discovered this place is now \"full\" service; a smart move as the wait staff had been missing out on tips I'm guessing. 

Had the Traditional Gyro Platter with rice and a small serving of hummus and pita. Tasty as always.  Really enjoy the tzatziki sauce on the gyro. Yum.

Server was Melia (?) who was cheerful and helpful.

Would like to go back and try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS FANTASTIC. The lunch wrap special is great. Comes with a a large salad too. The hummus and dressing was great. And a great price too. Wish they delivered though :("}
{"text":"Seem like they close when they feel like, 
Working hours show they open till 10:00, 
Came around 8:30 and was told they closing..shady spot"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and I really like the food. The setup is a little odd at first, you order from a cashier but then they bring the meal to your table, kind of like Panera Bread does, but you get used to it. The staff was super friendly and helpful and the kitchen got our meal out fast, even when it was busy. 

This past time I tried the chicken skewers which comes alone with rice or for a fee, as a platter with Greek salad and hummus with pita tips. The chicken was delicious and nicely seasoned and I liked that it came with grilled vegetables and even a few tiny grilled peaches. I also really liked the salad which was crunchy and tangy."}
{"text":"Employees were friendly.  Lots of vegetarian options and flavorful food.  I came during lunchtime--it was busy but the food came out fast and was delicious.  You get a hearty helping and there are a lot of menu options to choose from!"}
{"text":"I really only get the pomegranate chicken dinner. It's really good. I have gotten the tiramisu cheesecake twice and wasn't all that impressed either time."}
{"text":"My wife & I have been meaning to try this place for a while, & we finally got to this weekend.  Since it was beautiful outside and the sun was going down, we elected to sit outside.  Despite the parking lot being right beyond the gate, the atmosphere was still nice.  Our waiter was attentive the entire night, but I wasn't very happy with management when the misters came on as the sun went down, and they balked at turning them off even though there was only one other patron outside who was fine with them being turned off.  

Anyway, the food was mixed for us.  The Mediterranean Medley app was pretty good overall; unfortunately, neither of us enjoyed the Dolmades.  As for the main courses, my wife had the gyro, which she enjoyed more than other places, but she felt the side rice was bland.  I really was expecting more from the lamb roast cabernet; it was just alright for me.  However, the side potatoes were excellent.

All in all, we're on the fence on whether we'll give it another shot."}
{"text":"Service was good, the food may be the abosolue worst Greek food I have ever had. The rice is soooo dry you there is no way possible to eat it. I ordered the chicken skewers portion was small one had chicken the other only peppers and onions. My wife order the Greek trio some sort of combination plate horribly spiced, uneatable. Do yourself a favor go to the in and out across the street, I wish I had, could have save 50 bucks. The 2 stars are for the service NOT the food."}
{"text":"Been here quite a bit, thought it's due time for a review! Foods always been great, only gyro I'll eat in Vegas. Love this place. Gotta try it. And customer service is one of the best! Kudos to nichole! Best waitress yet. A big thank you to the MGC"}
{"text":"This is our third visit, second to this location. The food is fresh and tasty. 

Chose the Saganaki as an appetizer, delicious flaming cheese. We aren't eating carbs and they had no issues accommodating celery and cucumber instead of pita bread. 

My husband and I both had the Greek salad with grilled chicken. The chicken was grilled perfectly and topped with a little bit of mint for nice flavor. We did say no tomatoes and ended up with tomatoes but we can pick those out easily so no problem. 

Lunch service you order at the counter and dinner starts and four and is full service. Bathrooms are clean and service is pleasant. The owner served us. One thing I loved is the first time we came here it was the Durango location and the waitress introduced us to him, he gave us a coupon and invited us back. We live 30min away but if we are on this side of town and have an appetite we will surely come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food- I highly recommend the stuffed grape leaves as well as the spinach wrap Gyro. Everything tastes fresh and presentation is on point! Service has been good every time I have visited."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good is excellent and reasonable. Pomegranate chicken is my favorite."}
{"text":"A first time customer to Market Grille after reading several reviews on Yelp and other sites, I thought I'd give them a shot.  Got the Pom. Chicken Salad, Traditional Gyro, Hummus appitizer and some aphrodite cheesecake for desert.  The food was very tastey, the chicken was fall apart deliciousness in my opinion.  Desert was fantastic.  My only issue I had was with the staff, walked in, and guess they asume everyone's been there at one point or another.  Was directed to the take out area  after standing in the doorway looking puzzled for about 3-4 minutes.  Got there, sign on the wall says \"ring bell for service\".   OK.....this is a cafe, not a hotel, but alright.  Rang the bell....and nobody shows up after another 1-2 minutes, I ring it again, feeling a bit silly now.  I walked back out, and an older woman asked if I needed help and I said yea, I do, I've been ringing your bell for 5 minutes in the back and haven't seen anybody and I have $40 worth of food hanging out in your kitchen.  They brought out the food, checked it all before baging it up and even gave me a coupon for next time, which was nice, as I wasn't really mad about the situation, just annoyed that I was directed by the teenagers they have working as their cashiers but nobody had the motivation to go to the back and see what I wanted until I came back out and publicly and loudly asked for it."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty! Don't really know what authentic Greek food supposed to taste like but among the ones I've been to, they got some darn good tasting food! Glad I found this place close to my new work. Will be a regular lunch place :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE Mediterranean food. I love gyro. So already, you can't go wrong when you  go to a greek family owned restaurant!

But the thing I absolutely have to review is their Saganaki appetizer. Their description is: \"greek imported cheese, simmered with lemon & brandy. Served tableside on a \"flaming\" iron skillet\". But what they should have said is: \"heaven in your mouth\".

This dish is such an explosion of flavor. It's a savory and a little tangy, and absolutely perfect. I could NOT stop commenting how wonderful it was with every bite. Even while I was eating, I was worried that soon the dish was going to be done. There is no way I can possibly describe this dish to it's full potential, so I highly recommend everyone to just go try it for themselves!

I was so happy I randomly ordered this dish. After I tried it the first time, I had to go back with a friend only ONE WEEK later to make them try it too! Happily, she also really enjoyed it.

I will review the other foods there another time, but this post is dedicated to my all time new favorite dish anywhere: Saganaki!"}
{"text":"I was in a couple days ago and had the pleasure of having Malia (Hopefully I spelt it right) wait on me.  She was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu.  The food was great and I will be back.  I will say one thing though, Malia's co-worker (young Hispanic Girl- I think her name was Maria) was quite rude to her and other guests.  I felt tension between them as Malia was trying to give good service, the other girl was almost bossing her around, while she herself was doing nothing.  I feel you need more Malia's in your place and get rid of the other girl."}
{"text":"Excellent Food. Excellent Service. I ordered food to go, and one very kind employee offered us a sample of all their soups while we waited for our order. Doesn't get any better than that! ;)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here about 2 weeks ago for the 1st time. The cranberry pomegranate salad was good, I think it would be amazing if you sprinkle some dry cranberries on top, oh my!!! Hmm..yum yum! My son ordered the pasta which was good, but the chicken was a little burned & overcooked. Otherwisse, the customer service was good & it was just a pleasant night sitting outside enjoying my dinner. I couldn't have asked for more, and will definitely return for a different dish!!!"}
{"text":"Best Gyros in town! The meat is deliciously seasoned to perfection. Their lunch special is awesome. I've had lots of different items from their menu, all great, never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Where do I start! I love this place, my family & I go here for lunch and/or dinner at least once a week. Some of our favorites are the spinach/basil hummus, sagnaki, & my favorite dessert pumpkin baklava cheesecake is amazing! Service is awesome here, never a long wait."}
{"text":"This place is tasty and affordable. Definitely worth a try. I live close by so I tried Market Grille Cafe. It a sit down Mediterranean restaurant with entrees within the $12-20 range. This place has a lot of seating but you can be asked to wait because of the number of servers available. The decor is simple and clean with a old fashion vibe to it. The decor does have this generic \"wannabe\" Olive Garden live to it. I ordered the filet skewer which comes with a salad, 1 filet skewer, 1 vegetable skewer, rice, and pita bread. They also have wraps, gyros, and pastas. Next time I want to try the falafel. Overall, this place is decently price, it's a sit down restaurant and food quality is okay but you get what you pay for. Definitely worth a try for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We have eaten here three times now and this is one of my favorite spots now. We haven't had a meal that is bad, all the food is tasty and always fresh, and then service; always outstanding!!

The facility is always super clean and it is beautifully decorated and I always feel comfortable while we are here.  

I haven't had desert here, I'm always so full but it looks yummy!!

If you're up in the Northwest area this is Must try!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dining here! The food is high quality, tasty and of course mediterranean! When we walked in, we experienced a small wait and then seated. The restaurant interior is warm and welcoming. Everyone is friendly and this made me want to eat her even more. My friend discovered this place a while back and couldn't stop talking about how fresh and yummy the food was so I made her take me!  We started off our dinner with the Saganaki cheese appetizer. Oh my! This was so creamy and rich tasting. I could have easily enjoyed this with a salad and been satisfied but it was Friday night, just got paid so we proceeded to enjoy ourselves. Next came my entree which was the Mamma Mia chicken, goat cheese with a fig preserve and pistachios. Each bite of this dish literally melted in my mouth. I would have never thought to mix these ingredients together, but this dish was absolutely scrumptious. My friend enjoyed the Pomegranate Chicken which was marinated in pomegranate juices and herbs. Very flavorful!  The service was superb and our server was outgoing and bubbly. Whatever we needed, she had it brought out immediately. The owner made a point of coming over and asking me if I enjoyed my meal and had a genuine interest in what I had to say. She then gave me a card for a 15% discount on my next visit, which believe me there will be a second, third and quite possibly I could become a regular here. There are so many other dishes that I want to try and I did not get an opportunity to taste dessert. In addition to the food, they have a nice wine list to compliment your entree' which I took advantage of since red wine always makes you feel fine! So glad I took the time to check this place out and will happily be returning soon for some more \"kalo fagito\" as the Greek people say!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, but they treat their employees like shit. Owner is a good man but a total asshole when he is stressed. He belittles and degrades his employees in front of guests, then when people quit he withholds their tips and tries to make them feel guilty for moving on with their lives. I know, I had the lovely pleasure of working for him. I couldn't believe the way he talked to his wife, like she was a child. But again, the food is delicious, they are a nice family. They just need to learn how to treat people. It's a real shame, because I will never eat there again or recommend it to anyone I know. I refuse to support people who treat workers badly."}
{"text":"Had the Saganaki, Platos potatoes, & Falafel Gyro was very good and the service was alright. I would go back."}
{"text":"I've decided that I have to stop my quest for Greek food in Vegas. Good, affordable Greek food doesn't exist in here. Growing up with homemade moussaka, pastitsio, pomegranate chicken, pita, hummus, spanakopita, dolmades & kourabiedes, etc etc etc means that I'm well versed in Greek & Mediterranean cooking. I can cook everything on this menu, but sometimes I don't have 3 hours to devote to prepping and making giant moussaka. Sometimes I just want to get Greek food (that isn't a Kronos gyro) instead of making it myself. 

I've been to this MGC a handful of times, including once with my sister and once with Brian P.

The prices are steep for the portions provided. The sampler platter is quite small for the price. They have a happy hour, but I have not been to it here. 

Meals are pita & pilaf heavy, which makes me wonder why the entrees are so steep. The pomegranate chicken is dry and flavorless. The saganaki isn't remotely tangy.

Service is slow, even when the place is nearly empty. Maybe it's because the servers are teens or because they want to draw out the meals. I don't know, but after my last visit with my sister, we agreed that there was no point in a return visit."}
{"text":"Place is awesome. I'm a huge fan of gyros. I have tried the lamb, beef, and chicken gyro. All amazing. If you love traditional Greek food, this place is for you. Staff is friendly, service is quick, price is cheap, food is bomb. A++"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat. The food is always fresh, delicious, and never too long of a wait. The service is top notch and checking up on us. Sometimes they have a live performance of lounge music. It makes the environment very calm and fancy. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this restaurant. We've been here now three times and love it. Everyone is so nice and the food is amazing. If you have any questions ask, they are very helpful. Also we have an infant and it's very family friendly. I highly recommend it here."}
{"text":"We have been here a bunch of times.  I've never had a bad meal and always had great service. I usually get the gyro platter. My wife mixes it up when we go. You'll be happy you went."}
{"text":"This Greek restaurant has a good selection of Americanized Greek food for decent prices.  However, the food is not remarkable and seems salty, especially the salads.  
I like the gyros the hummus and the spinach pie but some of the pasta dishes leave a lot to be desired.  I find it insulting that they have to put a sign on the soda machine reminding the patrons with water cups not to steal soda.  And the \"opas\" for tips seems like orchestrated begging.  Service is good but parking is tough st lunch in this location."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner last week, good food for the price
Loved falafel wrap 
Also tried stuffed bell pepper , it was ok 
My son loves the fries
Will recommend to try it atleast once"}
{"text":"I gave them 2 stars because the environment was nice and had the soup been warm, it would have been good. The falafel was still wet as sticky inside, as if it wasn't cooked through. When I asked if that was normal, the response was, we get that alot. The so called Greek salad had what I believe was allspice in it. It wasn't a Greek salad.  Everything about the food was not good."}
{"text":"First time here and we almost drove past the grille , we were greeted right away and it was difficult to decide what to eat because I wanted to try almost everything on there, I was very satisfied with the veggie skewers I got , the seasoning was delicious, I literally ate everything on my plate. The music is fun to listen to and the service from staff was friendly . Thank you"}
{"text":"Ok food here... Salads are good portion ... The grape leaves are very good here but I have other go to spots for gyros... Very cute inside though"}
{"text":"I had spanikopita. Mmm. Delish.  Malaysia was our server, very pleasant and on top of everything."}
{"text":"I have to start out saying this location has only been open for a week and they are having a little opening week issues. We ordered the Mousaka, the Herb Roasted Chicken and the Saganaki appetizer. This restaurant is semi-fast food style and very casual.  You order and pay at the counter and they bring you your food. The saganaki (fire fried cheese) was too wet and not fire burnt.  The fire woudln't light. It seems the way they prepare it here (their other restaurant has been around for about for a few years) seems to be different from all other greek restaurants. My chicken tasted fine, but was too dry. My wife's Mousaka was ok-but not as good as she has had elsewhere.  She has been eating at Greek restaurants for years.  I think the real test is \"will we be back?\".  Maybe-but we will wait for them to work the 'bugs' out.
I feel new businesses should always be given some slack. I would give them 2.5 if I could. Nice touches-the Gluten free and Vegetarian notations on the menu for those that care about those things."}
{"text":"this is by far the most traditional Greek spot I been 2 ...it's amazing from the service to the food being exceptional..the pomegranate chicken was to die for..the gyros were everything and more...let's just I'm a be a regular"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and they have never disappointed me. I believe this Lake Mead Blvd. location is their first location and now they have another location in Centennial Parkway as well. I LOVE LOVE LOVE their greek salad and their hummus. I have not found a place with better hummus and greek salad yet. 

I usually order the Spanakopita which consists of spinach, feta & romano cheese, layered and baked in buttery filo pastry(got this from their menu). 

I also get the Keftedes which are little greek meatballs ;) and it comes with a yogurt dill sauce."}
{"text":"Best Greek food I've had so far. I've been to several Greek places and none compares to this place. They actually just opened a new store by Lake Mead Blvd. and 95. I usually order the beef ball patties meal, not sure what the name of the dish is. I get the meal so it comes with a drink, Greek salad, pita breads and hummus. Their hummus is delicious! I can eat it all day! I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to the area from Henderson and we admittedly have pretty high standards when it comes to Greek food. We decided to give Market Grille Cafe a try, based on the reviews and proximity to our house. The decor isn't exactly inviting or particularly Greek or Mediterranean, which should have been our first clue. The flow is a little weird; you order at the registers and they bring your food to your table for you. There isn't a ton of space in the register area and it gets congested quite easily. I did appreciate the Yelp check in offer, which I had no problem redeeming with the cashier. My husband and I had trouble locating a menu, but one of the girls eventually brought us a little brochure and we both decided on the Greek Gyro and an order of their seasoned fries. The cashier asked if we wanted yogurt sauce on our gyros, strike two! Gyros should always come with tzatziki sauce! I then ventured over to the corner to get some water from the fountain, there was a sign on the Soda Machine saying that Soda was not free. Seriously? I'm sure this is a minor issue in all restaurants, people saying that they would like water and then filling their cup with soda, but the soda costs virtually nothing. I have never seen this sign anywhere else and it was slightly offensive, let's not patronize our customers OK? When the food arrived it was lackluster at best. The gyro meat was cold and the yogurt sauce was just yogurt and dill. The fries were covered in Paprika and were served with a side of yogurt sauce with hot sauce mixed in, not good. The food was edible, but far from a delicious Greek meal and a definite disappointment."}
{"text":"Best best best pomegranate chicken. I loved the dish so much I ate here twice in two days. If I lived here, I would be a regular. You need to open up a place in DC!"}
{"text":"Market Grille Cafe was a go to spot for me and my co worker's on our lunch break. The lunch specials are reasonably priced and they have fresh and healthy options. I'm sad to say that we will not be returning. The past couple of times we have ordered to pick up, the customer service was horrendous. The first time we encountered this, my coworker was told her order would be ready to pick up in 25 minutes. About 30 minutes passes by and she leaves to pick up her food, 20 more minutes go by and she comes back into the office stating she had to wait for her order the whole time! Totaling almost an hour wait taking up her whole lunch break! Because we love their food we decided to give them a couple more chances. On another occasion my co worker waited 15 minutes for premade hummus and carrots. The final straw was when we called to place an order for pick up and my coworker wanted the chicken and veggie skewers lunch special with a salmon kabob on the side. The young girl took the order over the phone and 25 min later we go to pick it up. She then tells my co worker the total was $25. She had charged her for a lunch special and a salmon kabob (full price) my co worker (she was hungry) explained she only wanted the kabob not the sides to which the young girl replied \"oh you have to ask for it ala cart, but I'll remember that for next time\". Used to have great customer service but lately it seems like some of the staff needs training"}
{"text":"when I'm cravin some greek I head here since its so close to my place. 

the place is very nicely decorated, the staff is friendly and accomodating and tables are clean. A presentable establishment
is a good first impression to me. 

The menus is large and on display against the wall when you walk in and on 3 display boards. 

Lunch specials? yes they do! 7.50  for a gyro and drink. 

food is good but another greek restaurant will always have my heart. the rice is tender, the chicken gyro is tasty with lots of flavor and hummus is somewhat bland.

we ordered the dessert sampler with your choice of 3 desserts. Canolis?yaya cookies and aphrodites cheesecake. OMG! the aphrodites cheesecake is a
must try. cheesecake with a layer of baklava
underneath! *drools* haha."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  The waitress let me sample all four soups so I can make up my mind.  They were all so good.   The pomegranate chicken and Greek salad were the best.  Will be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome lunch special and I find myself coming here 3-4 times per week on my break. I've really enjoyed everything I've tried. I also love that they are gluten free friendly and have their menu items labeled. They even have gluten free pasta that is actually delicious! Great place for a lunch deal with food that is pretty healthy overall and great for gluten-free options!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for dinner here with my big family.  We had to add a table and they were very accommodating.  I ordered the pomegranate chicken and the Aphrodite's cheesecake.  I made my husband order the tiramisu cheesecake.  All very yummy!  Service was great."}
{"text":"I came with a date for lunch.  We both ordered the Gyro lunch special.  I had the Chicken Gyro with the yogurt/dill sauce and the Pumpkin soup.  I loved the Gyro and the dill sauce, the chicken was good - though not over the top, however...the soup was UNBELIEVABLE!!  The layers of flavor were awe-inspiring!  

I will definitely go back!  Loved it!  Service was fantastic!

BTW, the tile floor with the grape leaves in it was amazing and beautiful too!!"}
{"text":"We were excited to see a Greek restaurant not too many around. 
We tried this place out and was really disappointed. We went in at lunch there was not many people there. Seemed like it took forever for our food to come out. When it did we were shocked at how much you do get for the amount they charge,
We just thought it was a bit over priced for the money, it is a good place to go if your not that hungry. The food itself was pretty good. We probably would not go back."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Staff is always very nice and the food is always great.  Love the Saganaki (flaming Cheese) and the Pomegranate Chicken is delicious.  My wife loves the Pasta dishes, and I also often order a Veggie (yes Veggie) Gyro with Peaches inside.  Don't knock it until you've tried it.
 
Their desserts are also delicious.  Aphrodite Cheesecake is one of my fave.  

I highly recommend everyone to this place."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place for so long it was finally time I steeped in. So the style of this restaurant is a big different than most. You walk in and then order at the counter then go take a seat and when is ready they bring it to you. 

The atmosphere is very welcoming. The service was pretty good too. Traditional, delicious Mediterranean fares to be found here. Great for meat and non-meat eaters alike. But be sute tocheck out that dessert menu!"}
{"text":"Didn't know about yelp until after I ordered but this place has really good food. The food is a bit pricey but you get a descent amount of food. The staff is nice but I had one instance where a girl was so rude I just walked out.  There's another place by my house which is very good and cheaper, but I'm closer here."}
{"text":"Shelly provided excellent, prompt, friendly, attentive service. Food...great! Baklava topped with ice cream, pumpkin cheese cake on a baklava crust, topped off our tasty dinner. Super clean, inviting space all added to the very good dinner... chopped Greek salad, and the chicken pomegranate with rice. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"First time here and it was awesome! Guy at register was so helpful and nice! Food was the best Greek food in town by far! The owner came over and she asked us how everything was. Then she started talking about The cheesecake, so we had to go back and order one of each. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I just adore this place. The best food. Amazing owners that greet you themselves when there. I had never tried the desserts and even after we had paid, the owner sold us. She put in an order for one of each for us. Amazing. I do love Mediterranean food, so it's not a hard sell, but the lack of over salting is incredible. Super fresh. Fast service. I cant day enough!"}
{"text":"Food here is consistently flavorful, fresh, and generously portioned. The service staff is always accommodating and very friendly. I usually order the filet skewer entree and am never disappointed. Also very affordably priced for dinner and lunch!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a month.  I usually get the pomegranate chicken gyro platter. I never get tired of this dish. The restaurant has a nice relaxed feel to it. Nice music."}
{"text":"I just went here for the first time today. Really great atmosphere, service and food. The avgolemono is great! My daughter didn't know what to order and our waitress really walked her through the menu and made some great recommendations. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time tonight. The food was amazing and the service spectacular! Tried several dishes including the Pomegranate Chicken (yum!) and baklava (really sweet but super delicious!). Our waitress, Debbie, was beyond wonderful - if only she can be cloned and placed in every restaurant around town! Will definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding, service was good, decor was bright and clean.  The owner came out to speak with us during our meal which was a nice touch. Very positive dining experience!"}
{"text":"Ok, this was some of the BEST Mediterranean food I have ever had! I have had Mediterranean food across a few states & I'm not saying it's the BEST EVER but it is close or will soon replace #1!!! \"A\" for seasoning & taste!  I am known for my food recommendations & I brought my left overs to my wife...6hrs after I left The restaurant. And what do U know, she shared the same sentiments! I told the restaurant & my wife we will go there every time we come to Vegas & that's a promise!!! Oh, I NEVER write reviews! L.A.Y."}
{"text":"This place is adorable! The prices are reasonable and food was great! It wasn't over seasoned. Service was \"meh\" but all in all I would return. It's a good place to go for any occasion!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times now and everytime the service has been quite good. Really friendly people and fun environment for the most part. In terms of food I've had their traditional gyro, chicken, papous pasta, and falafels. the gyro was good but i'd recommend going w chicken over the lamb/beef and the falafels are always a nice side. Their hummus was decent and their greek salad is very good. Overall the place is pretty decent and there's lots of dishes I have yet to try, but based on the service alone i give it a 3/4!"}
{"text":"Great little place with a huge selection of very yummy Greek/Mediterranean food.  The pomegranate chicken was very good.  Also had a skewer and the spanakopita and we kinda split and shared all three. 

We are in from out of town but I would definitely eat here often if we lived close by!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim one day for lunch, and I'm so glad I did! My friend and I happened to make it here during happy hour, and the food, service, and atmosphere were all as great as I'd heard. I'm not at all an expert on Greek/Mediterranean food, so I can't speak to its authenticity, but my friend and I thoroughly enjoyed everything we tried. We also each had plenty of leftovers! Believe the hype - this place has delicious food with great service."}
{"text":"You can walk in and feel right at home! This place has a comforting feel. You can tell the owners are passionate about their restaurant. Food was good, presentable and reasonably priced. The staff are all very polite and have great customer service. The only thing I didn't really like was their Hummus (odd after taste) and their Salad dressing (too sweet).
This was my second time here and it won't be my last."}
{"text":"I probably would have never came here due to me having no desire to try Greek food. But my friend made me, and let me tell you. It was not a mistake. I may not get the most \"authentic\" of Greek food when I'm here. My meal usually consist if the chicken skewers, but those skewers are delicious. The rice and salad that goes along with the dish is perfection. Love it! I've tried the gyros among other before and all of it was good. Give this place a shot if you haven't. The service is really well and every time I go the wait staff is very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Great quaint spot.  Very authentic atmosphere and food.  I had the lamb roast gyro platter.  Everything tasted great.  I wish I would have gotten the traditional gyro.  The roast had large pieces."}
{"text":"My gyro is always made to perfection!  The Greek salads are incredible and the staff is always polite.  The lunch combos now include a drink!  I just love this place!"}
{"text":"A taste of fresh sure to make any skeptic a believer!

I was put onto Market Fresh from a friend who would show up to work with leftovers. He preferred market fresh over the alternative \"to-go\" locations conveniently located on the Durango/Centennial Las Vegas drive-by.

Greek and Mediterranean style cuisine, family owned and operated with a knack for adding a flavorful twist to some well-known, basic recipes. My first meal, a chicken salad, was superb and left me with a twitch in my pallet for more. I intend on making this a frequent stop as I also venture to stay active and healthy!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was not at all impressive. Rice was dry and old, spanakopita was awful, salmon too fishey, the only thing I finished was the tabouli salad. So disappointed because I had heard good things."}
{"text":"We have gone to this place twice and never disappoints me! So family oriented environment, they really care with great service! The food is amazing also!"}
{"text":"Very clean. Nice atmosphere. The owners really care about their customers. Our server Kathy was exceptionally nice. We had the chicken pomegranate salad and the baklava, excellent."}
