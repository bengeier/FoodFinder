{"text":"We got takeout and it was great! The wait time was longer than expected, but they were very nice. We had soup and shrimp lo mein."}
{"text":"Worst food in the history of civilization.  Beef chop suey?  Beef was spoiled, sauce was yellow.  House egg foo young?  Shrimp and chicken not cooked, awful.  Wonton soup?  Tastless.  Drive anyplace else for chinese food.  Don't get ripped off like we did."}
{"text":"Pay no attention to the reviews giving four stars and it's their first review. This attempt at American-Chinese is still awful.  Kinda surprised by now that they're still in business."}
{"text":"The absolute worst even if the food is decent. Went in lunch break. He said he never got my call. Not only did I call but I called back to add an order. He stood there for fifteen minutes not taking or preparing my order. I asked several time if he would please start my order. Complete language barrier. No lunch. Charged full price for his multiple mistakes. Never again. Only gave it a star because yelp made me."}
{"text":"They seem to have a whole new crew working there and food reflected that. Chicken chow mean was horrible, fried rice was closer to white rice in flavor and even the egg foo young was not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best take out in North Olmsted.  Their prices are in line and we eat here at least once every three weeks.  I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"They have some strengths, but have gone downhill in the last 2 years since they opened. Their soups are relatively bland in my opinion but very salty. Any kind of fried chicken you get (sweet & sour, general tso) is very crunchy with too much breading and some pieces of chicken I honestly question if it was chicken. The fried rice is good and the wontons and egg rolls are adequate, but the menu overall could use some work. Too bad there is nothing in the area that is better so you may be stuck."}
{"text":"Food is just okay for Chinese takeout. I got the lomein and it was probably the worst I've ever had. I wasn't a fan and there are other places a little further away with way better food."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad; about average for a small Chinese take out place. The service, however, is great. I used to eat here a lot when they first opened, but haven't eaten here for quite some time,  and the woman who owns the restaurant still asks my family how I'm doing, and is very courteous to any dish alterations.  Their biggest weakness is spice; even requesting a very spicey dish doesn't get you very far."}
{"text":"There are some aspects of Lily Chinese that I believe are 5 star worthy, while others only merit one at best.   Let's start with the good: Their egg rolls are the best around. Period. Portion sizes are great. They are one of the few places that can make my favorite dish (Beef w/ oyster sauce) the way I like it. Their House Lo Mein is very good. Their lunch specials (which include a generous portion of your favorite dish, fried rice, and an egg roll) are dirt cheap and usually can provide two meals unless you're a big eater. They're also open on holidays - even Christmas - which came in very handy one year.   The not so good: their fried rice is just not very good. Bland and at times almost like white rice with vegetables. My main complaint is that no matter how many times I say I want a dish to be spicy, extra spicy, super duper extra spicy, or \"en fuego\" spicy, they're rarely ever achieve it. A few times they've surprised me, though.   Overall, Lily Chinese is very solid Chinese takeout option in the 44138 area."}
