{"text":"We stopped here on the way back from the pens game last week. While we thought that this place might be decent when we first walked in, BOY WERE WE WRONG! No service for 18 minutes and there were LITERALLY 3 people at the bar. There was one bartender who continued to talk to one of the patrons while eating (what looked to be fried chicked) out of a Tupperware container. The thought of that alone still makes me sick to my stomach. When she finally came over, after my husband finally asked her to, she was huffing and puffing as if we were inconveniencing her. She sighed as she took our order and then waited another 5 minutes before even pouring our drinks. She didn't even ask if we wanted food, which to this day, i regret ordering. Even on an empty stomach, the food we ordered was pathetic. They shouldn't be aloud to serve food at this establishment. Our wings tasted like they were made from two week old chicken and prepared 2 weeks ago.... disgusting. Please, I forewarn you, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, ENERGY OR MONEY AT THIS PLACE. From our experience in this industry, this place will be out of business in a few weeks anyway...  THANK GOD."}
{"text":"Been here several times since they opened last summer.  Always good food and service, clean and pleasant.  Young, old and families in nice atmosphere.  This site and another recently had some horrendous reviews posted.  All within a day or two and a repeat of some similar language.  If you just walk into this restaurant you will know those reviewers seem to have an ax to grind or they are just plain delusional.  Something is fishy.

{"text":"Wow what a hole in the wall! Avoid this pathetic excuse for a bar. Absolutely nasty food, terrible service and a customer base that's straight out of the trailor park. Go ANYWHERE else!!! You've been warned!!"}
