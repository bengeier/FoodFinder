{"text":"We'll never be back which is a bummer because it's so close to our house. Very cool atmosphere and patio but the foo is horrible and way overpriced. One appetizer and one small pizza that taste like a pizza pocket would up being about $35. I see other reviews about the manager working in the corner and laugh because she was still working there. We were the only people there in the middle of the day, doesn't surprise me at all."}
{"text":"Our family was very happy to see a wood fire pizza restaurant in the neighborhood. We dine out often and having a large family it's hard to please everyone so when we saw pizza, pasta, and paninis on the sign we couldn't wait to try this place.
When we walked in we waited for a few moments at the door before we were greeted by the pizza chef. A gentleman finally sat us off in a dark corner of the restaurant we needed to use our lights on phones to read menus. The place looked fairly busy but the wait staff seemed unorganized. It seemed that the waiters were unable to serve wine and the bartender had to come serve us. There appeared to be a couple of managers but neither seemed to be much help to the waiters. On the other hand the place looked very modern, the children enjoyed watching the chefs entertain us making the pizzas. We had some of the assorted Brushchetta they were  delicious. I also really enjoyed the raspberry vinaigrette on my salad and the candied pecans. My children and husband said this was the best pizza they've ever had. We are so happy when the chef greeted our table, apologized for the delay in service and kindly brought over vanilla bean ice cream which was a treat for the children. The homemade cannolis were also quite good. Overall we really enjoyed the food, the desserts and the chefs attention but waiter staff and managers need to step it up. I've lived in Gilbert a long time we are glad to have this family restaurant near us. I hope they fine tune the staff and I'm sure this will be a hit in town because the food is reasonably priced, it's kid approved pizza and delicious. 2Stars for Service , 5Stars for food"}
{"text":"My wife and I were more than excited to try Via.  We arrived just after 7pm and there were no available tables, so we happily sat at the bar.  There was a live musician, which unfortunately is the only part of the evening that would get a good review from me.

We quickly ordered 2 appetizers shortly after arriving.  As we sat...and sat...and sat...the couple next to us was brought their bruschetta, which they had been waiting for for nearly 30 minutes - and then it was not even their correct order!  

We inquired about our bruschetta, it had now been 30 minutes - the bartender told us it was up next... 30 minutes later, still nothing!  We asked and asked, and kept being told, it was coming... ok, I am no chef - but if bruschetta takes an hour to make, something just isn't right.  All over the restaurant this was a ongoing theme - no one getting their food and if they did, it was wrong.

The bartender tried to give us a \"free\" glass of wine - but when you have to wait over an hour for something that should be out in 10 minutes - that is not enough.

At an an hour and 15 minutes of waiting - we finally called it and left - never receiving our food - the manager told us that \"they were just behind in the kitchen\".  Totally unacceptable and disappointing - I think I was more than patient in giving them the 1 hour + of my life waiting for a simple appetizer...

Unfortunately - that 1st experience has ruined it and needless to say we will not be returning - nor can I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I joined Yelp just so I could warn others of Via. Me and my wife went on a Saturday night. It maybe had 20 folks inside. That is what we were looking for after a day of kids sports. We sat at the bar thinking we would get the best and fastest service. The drink order did not take all that long and in fact the new bar tender while slow and forgetful was just learning. That I have a lot of tolerance for because he was working hard. We ordered and waited about 45 min before asking the couple next to us how long they had been waiting. After they said they had waited over a hour I was checked out. So I really can't say how the food was. We waited about 1:20 min with no sign of food. So I payed for the drinks and they gave me the bill fold back with out my Credit card. I asked them for it and the manger had it in her pocket. So I will not be back."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever witnessed.  Food was not good for the price.  This place is an absolute joke!"}
{"text":"Well well well where to start...Second visit as the first one was a disaster..should have stayed away...had the pizza and it was so unevenly cooked..crispy blackened edges and dough in theno middle..come on..how hard is it to cook a pizza when it is the staple of your menu...wife had lasagna and it was barely warm and no where worth 14 bucks....service was pretty pathetic as well....I actually had to go up to the bar and order my drink....oh and by the way... there was only a handful of customers in the place....another one scratched off the list."}
{"text":"Is this place still open? We pulled up at 5:45pm on a Monday and it was closed, barstools up, etc. There's no sign on the door saying closed for any special reason. Highly disappointing."}
{"text":"If you're reading these reviews and thinking surely a restaurant can't be this bad.   Well let me tell you it's every bit as bad as people say.   The worst service I have ever experienced in my whole life and the food is well below average.   My experience was much the same as everyone else's here.   It's a shame as it's within walking distance of my house and I really wanted to like it.  If I could give less than 1 star I would.   If anything you should go for the comedy factor because this place is a joke."}
{"text":"Best place ever!! great staff with an italian classy set up. music was exelent-food was amazing! feel good atmospher. . also The owner sat next to me and was very kind while operating the staff on a polite and very assertive way. Verry busy owner! lots of good ideas and great events to come! Thank Christy for putting together such a great place to chill and meet great people! This place is going to be huge in gilbert! Do go visit!!!"}
{"text":"We sat there for over an hour with no food. We ordered an appetizer that never came. Food was alright but my pizza was cold and my boyfriends was hot. Don't think we'll be returning. First impressions are everything."}
{"text":"We get there at 11am on a Sunday and there are 2 workers outside waiting because the manager hasn't arrived yet. When she gets there she tells us the other person did a no show at 10am and she had to drive all the way from Goodyear or such. We wanted to sit on the patio so we just sat ourselves while she let everyone in. We ended up not being able to eat for almost 2 hours because the wood fire oven had to get to a certain degree before they could cook the pizzas. When we got our bill it was hand written on small pieces of paper, super sketchy! I seriously felt like Ashton Kutcher was going to jump out and say we were being punked because the service was so bad. I would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Second time and the experience just gets worse!  Pizza is soggy and limp, can't get a beverage order right, patio has heaters.... But no gas.  Ordered a lemonade got concentrate, ordered a raspberry lemon drop, no raspberry in the drink, ordered 3 beverages, got charged for 4.  Exhaust system needs improvement, if I wanted to smell like a wood oven I would cook over one.  Can't handle a party over 3.   Sat in the corner and was ignored, had every server bring food and drink to the table.  Asked for the check and they asked me who my server was...couldn't tell them because it was ALL of them.  The boy friend who \"helps out\" but doesn't get paid should stick to his paying job and not giving us his B.S.....  Avoid and find a Nello's!"}
{"text":"Just to update, the owner contacted my wife and apologized for the food and service, she was out on that day, she did give me my money back and made things right, so that's good!

I think we will try this place again sometime!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Via tonight and it was wonderful! The inside was so lively with live music and a great crowd of people. We decided to sit outside and it was perfect. The food was good and I loved that the house wine was a chianti and a Zin and not your typical merlot. Both house wines were good but I recommend the Chianti... Very fruit forward and jammy... So good! Our server was very attentive and frequently stopped by to see how we were doing.

I do have a bit of feedback. The wine list should include where the wine is from. The location of the wine is almost as important as the varietal. Furthermore if you are going to call your restaurant a wine bar you should also include the vintage of the wine.

Keep doing what you are doing and we will be back shortly!!!
Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible! 
This is the location where Tutti Santi used to be. Tutti Santi had very high quality food and outstanding service. My family were regulars there and enjoyed what a friendly, professional, restaurant it was. Unfortunately, it went out of business because it was a bit pricy (but you payed for the quality of the meal) and it is in a poor location that didn't get a lot of traffic. ANYWAYS, we thought that they were just changing their name and menu a little to make it more affordable so we tried Via about a week after it opened. As it turns out, it is a completely new owner and restaurant. 

Via Review:
Oh where to start...The first thing that I noticed when I walked in was that either the owner or the manager had recites and papers all over one of the tables against the wall that she was using as her office...while people were dining around her...very, very unprofessional!!! Also she was dressed liked she was lounging around the house instead of running a restaurant. Again, very unprofessional when they have such big shoes to fill. 

Overall, the service was very slow. They only had one waitress working the entire restaurant with the help of the bartenders (it was very unorganised, they stood by the bar, talked and pointed at tables to see who was in charge of what...). My dad asked the waitress what red wine they had she responded with \"I don't drink but I'll ask our \"wine expert\" (as she motioned to the manager/owner in the corner with all of her papers) and she said she would send her over to talk to my dad. Needless to say she did not come over and just sent her recommendation over with the waitress (not a huge deal but it showed a lack of interest in serving the customers). My mom ordered a beer and when it was brought out there was beer spilling down the side of the glass and onto the table, and they did nothing... After that, we ordered our food which consisted of my mom's bruchetta, my chicken over spaghetti, and my dad's pizza. In about 8 minutes my moms dinner came out by itself (all of the food should be brought out together), then 15 minutes later when my mom was done with her dinner, mine came out, then 40 minutes after we ordered (the restaurant was not busy either) my dad's pizza came out...and it was the wrong one..he ordered a chicken pesto pizza and it had neither chicken or pesto. As my dad explained our grievances to one of the bartenders that was checking on us the manager who was sitting at the bar right behind him never did a thing. As the manager, you should be the one making sure the customer is happy and if anything goes wrong you kiss their butt to make it clear that you actually care. She didn't even acknowledge us once.

I feel really bad for the chef because the food was accually really good. However, no matter how good the food is, if you don't have good dining experience with the wait staff and then the manager doesn't care...I'll take my business elsewhere.  

Even with the pizza being taken off the bill, due to the mixup, the bill was still 38 dollars...Is the quality of the food worth the money? I would say probably. However, I will not pay a good amount of money for that low of a level of customer service. 

There are so many other great options for places to eat around this area. Save yourself a lot of irritation and if you're thinking of trying this place out...don't!!!"}
{"text":"Arrogance and ignorance is a bad combination for any business but especially a retail or restaurant establishment.  I heard this place replaced Tutti Santi, so we decided to check it out but there is no website or online menu.  I called to confirm that there was no menu posted online and was told that was correct but that I could stop by to pick up a to-go menu.  A few days later I decided to go 5 miles out of my way to pick up a to-go menu.  When I walked in around 1 PM the place was empty except for 2 bar patrons.  I asked the man for a to-go menu and he said they didn't have any and wasn't sure when they would be getting them.  I saw a stack of about 50 dine-in menus that were at the hostess stand that were double-sided copy papers in a clear laminate...that MAYBE cost 5 cents each...so I asked the gentleman if I could just take one home and return it when we came back to either dine-in or take-out.  He said he couldn't allow that.  I then offered to PAY for the menu and he said he couldn't allow that either.  Most businesses know how much it costs to attract or acquire a customer and it seemed to me that 5 cents wasn't too much to ask to provide us with a menu from which to order, but not here.

When I got home I called the place back to speak with the owner and a young lady told me there were several owners and that \"they don't speak to customers\"!  I told her to give them a message that however good their food might be they are going to fail if they don't talk to or respect their customers feedback.

I can't comment on the food but will predict this place will be out of business in less then a year."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  Thought we would try Via for the first time since it is less than a mile from our home and we were looking forward to trying someplace that could be our new home away from home.  We arrived shortly after 6:30 and were quickly seated, right in front of the doorway.  Within a few moments we were greeted and our drink orders taken.  I do not recall being told of any specials or any suggestions, although we didn't ask either.  Our server, Mackenzie came around several times to see if we were ready to order and we finally settled on some calamari.  We asked for a few more minutes to order our entrees. We finally settled on our meals, placed our orders and the wait began.  

Being a party of 6, we understand can be confusing to new servers, so we are patient, however it was almost 40 minutes before our calamari arrived.  It was decent, although I would not say hot.  I can't say if it was due to the fact it had been sitting or if it is because the front door was being held open and the cold air was literally blowing our table away, while the gentleman, whom I assume was the host, decided if and where he was going to seat people as they came in. (more on him in a moment)

Our table ordered 3 salads and they arrived and were average, at best.  No flavor to the caesar salad but the pear one was nice, but small for the price.  After another 45 minutes we still had no entrees.  When we were able to ask our server, it was always the same answer \"any minute\".  By now, our mouths were watering as we were watching pizza after pizza sitting on the ledge waiting for our server to run food to the tables around us.  FINALLY, our food arrives, although it is only half of our order and even that is wrong.  Our server immediately offers us to keep one of the \"errors\" for free and walks away.  We had to flag her down a few minutes later to see where the other 3 entrees were and she seemed very confused as to why they didnt show up.  She comes back from the kitchen and said they will rush it and it should be about 2 minutes.  In the meantime, we completed the three meals that were served and still had not receieved the missing meals.  She, and the busgirl/watergirl/busgirl seem to keep \"checking\" with the kitchen and after about 20 minutes bring our missing meals out and tell us that they will comp those as well.  What a shame that our meals did not arrive so that our family could eat together, becaues the pasta dishes were all BURSTING with flavor.  The sauces were amazing.  It would have been nice to have some sort of a bread with the dishes though to pick up any left over sauces. Even though we wanted dessert and coffee, we didn't have any more time to sit and wait, so we opted to go elsewhere for those.

As we sat and waited, we kept seeing an older gentleman standing by the door in a 3 piece suit.  I assumed he was an owner there to see things ran well, however he never spoke to us, was only interested in walking around with his hands in his pockets or holding the doors wide open.  If he is a greeter or host, they really need to rethink that, since more people came and left for lack of being seated.  We saw a table wait for him to seat them while he went to find silverware, only to have them leave after 15 minutes since their server never came to get their drink order.

The bar seemed to be more of a playpen.  There was a woman wearing an ill fitting tube top, and open vest.  I am assuming she is in charge by the way she pushed her self around.  In addition, there were about 3 other young men behind the bar with her the entire time.  

I would love to say that we would go back for the food alone, but sadly, I don't see that happening.  That plaza has lost so many things already and we were really hopeful this time, but unless they get people in there that care, they might as well close the doors now.  We enjoyed the food and would have paid for it since we ate it, although, Mackenzie had comped the meals that arrived so late, but even at that, the bill was $85.  

I have worked in restaurants in my time and NEVER have I seen one run so poorly.  There is no reason that 2 or 3 servers cannot staff that place.  There is NO reason why pizzas should sit and get cold because nobody will run food.  There is NO reason why a manager did not immediately come over to our table after the problems, (never did we see anyone other than our waitress about the problems). The servers/barstaff all seemed to spend more time in line to use the one POS station, it's not a wonder food orders are wrong.

If anyone finds a contact number/email for the owners, I would love to have it as well."}
{"text":"I haven't Yelp'd in a while.  However I was trekking to the dreaded suburbs to meet friends for dinner and I wanted to see if there was anything new and locally owned and came across reviews for this place,  some were so scathing I knew it was the place for me to try.  

I have been in and out of the service industry for decades some of these reviews were either written by former or current employees who simply do not like change.  With that said, here is my honest unbiased review.

The food was good, the pizza was good, the service was good.  It is a new family owned restaurant, give the growing pains a chance to subside.  I had a memorable experience and I will go back infact it was so memorable we are having my sisters rehearsal dinner there.  It was fun the staff was overly attentive sometimes good sometimes bad but we definitely knew they were there weather we wanted or not.  Our water glasses and soda were so over filled we practically floated out of the place. 

We were greated with a smile, we were thanked with a smile as we left.  What more can you ask for.

I like it better with out of the pretentiousness of the Tutti Santi name it is more relaxed and just a little bit more fun.  

The guy with the obvious north east New York / Jersey accent was hilarious everytime he talked I lost it.  

Thank you again for a good time I hope we get to the GREATNESS level"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wonderful service! My husband and I are a little picky about service- so that is a compliment indeed! Sandy was his waitress and he was impressed. The pizza was excellent too, we are happy to have a neighborhood restaurant so near our house that has great food and a great staff... when I logged on to see the reviews I was shocked that there are some negative ones! Either they have fixed the \"issues\" or it was a fluke.We thought the food and service were stellar!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Mom n Pop ambiance.  Cute but not too cute.  Friendly staff.  Overall wonderful experience.  The food is okay not great 6/10.  Looking forward to trying more dinners. 
Also, totally adorable live music performer."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were excited to try Via, after seeing the signs up for a couple of weeks. We live less than a mile from the restaurant, and loved the idea of a pizza joint close by. We went out to celebrate my birthday, and decided it was a good time to give it a try.

We arrived on a Friday night, around 6:30. The restaurant was half full, with several tables open. We walked in, and a lady behind the bar said she would be right with us. There were also 2 other servers behind the bar, which seemed to be a constant theme. After standing in the doorway for a couple of minutes, she finally came out and brought us to a table. Every waiter there was wearing black pants and a black button down shirt. She was wearing a brownish, low cut tank top. Looked like she had come in off the street for a drink. Very unprofessional looking. And I think she was the manager. After seating us, she said she would be right back with some waters, and our server would be by shortly. She never came back with the water, and we waited about 5 minutes for our server to arrive. We ordered 2 waters, a soda, and an iced tea. He brought them out, and then left. My fiance's tea was terrible, and she told the busboy, who removed it from the table. Several minutes later, the waiter returned. He never offered her something else to drink, or even mentioned the tea. He then told us they were out of pasta, and we would have to order a pizza or an appetizer. How does an Italian restaurant run out of pasta?

We ordered a pear salad and a pesto chicken pizza to split. After we ordered, while we waited a very long time to receive our food, we both looked around at the decor and commented that there was something lacking in the atmosphere of the place. We couldn't put a finger on it, but it felt like we were sitting in a dark room, not a nice restaurant. As we waited for our salad, we both needed a refill on our water. We looked around for our waiter, who was behind the bar with the lady and two other waiters. After over 10 minutes, the busboy brought out our salad, and promptly came back to refill our water. The highlight of the evening was the salad. It was delicious. Greens topped with pear slices, cheese, and a cherry vinagrette dressing. And the kitchen was nice enough to deliver it on two separate plates since we were splitting one salad. We still have not seen our waiter since he took our order.

A second waiter delivered our pizza. He dropped the pizza off, and said \"Here you are\" and walked off. We called after him that we needed plates. He brought us some plates, but didn't say anything to us. We both took a bite of the pizza before realizing it was not what we ordered. I think they gave us a bbq pizza. We looked around for our waiter, who was once again behind the bar. We waited a few minutes for him to come by, but he never did. My fiance went up to the bar to let him know. He walked up to the pizza counter and placed an order for a new pizza, then walked away. He still never came over to our table to check on us, apologize, or refill our drinks. 

While we were waiting for the next pizza, we watched 4 other groups walk in. One was seated by a waiter, two seated themselves, and one was sat by the guy making the pizza, who shouted across the room for them to sit where ever they liked. All four groups eventually got up an left, having never spoken to a waiter. Our waiter finally comes to our table. When we complain about our service, and point out that 4 groups left because of lack of service, his only comment was \"I understand.\" I'm not sure if he meant \"I understand, but I don't care\" or \"I understand, but am powerless to fix it\". Either way, he left and still did not refill our waters or soda. 

After being at the place for over an hour, and still not having a pizza, we got up, walked over to the bar, where our waiter was once again hanging out, and told him we were tired of waiting, complained about the service, and said  that we were leaving. His response once again was \"I understand.\" He did comp us our salad. He walked out frustrated, disappointed, and hungry. We went down the road to Red Robin and had a free birthday hamburger.

After we left we checked the Yelp reviews to see that terrible service seems to be a gripe from everyone. Unless you sit at the bar, where you'll have at least 3 people to serve you at all times."}
{"text":"We were quickly addressed at the front door and took a seat on the patio. I ordered the soup and my husband ordered the calamari.  The soup was tasty but a tad on the salty side. We shared a Margherita pizza and was very good but on the warm side and not hot as I'm accustomed too (could of been from being outside). The tiramisu was one of the best I've had and I'm from the east coast and 70% Italian. 
The place is decorated very nicely and they had live music that was very good.  I would definitely recommend this place and will go back again."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend and had a good time.   The pizza was great and they were having a complimentary wine tasting.   The bar was really comfortable and Eric was friendly.   They had live music as well that was great!"}
{"text":"First time, but not last time. Gourmet pizzas and great ambiance. The patio and the happy hour is amazing."}
{"text":"We has dinner at Via this week and had a wonderful experience. great food and great service. We had the vegetarian pizza and the tiramisu. We enjoy going to local mom and pop restaurants and Via has a very laid back ambiance and puppy friendly dining on the outdoor patio.

The pizza is similar to Grimaldi's. great pecan smoked flavor to the crust and fresh ingredients. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The salad was good but we never got our pizza to try it since they messed up our order and then forgot about us. We were told when we arrived that the pastas dishes were unavailable -- no reason was given.  The service and overall environment were awful. No one working there knew what their role was. There were three people behind the bar -- including a woman who was dressed like she was lounging at the park -- and they were incredibly slow and unapologetic. Whoever is closest to the door seats people and then the guests wait for more than 10 minutes to get a menu or drink. While we were there we watched five tables walk out for lack of service. Only the bar guests were tended to. Try it at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Not sure about the other reviews but I had a delightful experience here. The food was very tasty. We had the cheese pizza for my son and the pesto for myself. I thought it sucked they didn't have a kid size or individual size pizza but they offered to do half and half for us. Also had the bacon covered scallops, which were not my favorite but they came out promptly and our drinks were refilled quite fast as well. The icing on the cake was their creme burle which was delicious and not too sweet or heavy for a dessert.  Will definetly be coming back here. Also had no problem with the staff as some others have commented, our waiter seemed really friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I've been trying to eat through the whole menu...eat something new every time and I do have to say their food is always above average. The chicken piccata is still my all time favorite. The staff here has always been professional and gone above and beyond on their service."}
{"text":"Well.... The restaurant changed hands the day before we arrived. The seated us immediately then promptly asked for our order...3 times... Without giving us time to read the menu. When we said we needed time to look at the menu they disappeared for 10 minutes. I needed more than 30 seconds between inquiries on if we were ready but not 10 minutes. I'll give them some grace since it was only day 2. 

My husbands small pizza was ample. He said it was good but probably wouldn't crave it. I love chicken picatta so I ordered that. It came with a side of pasta with marinara sauce which I found too heavy to accompany the delicate wine sauce on the chicken. Both good meals. We might try it again after they've been open longer."}
{"text":"A creepy old guy who looked like a cross between a 70's porn star and a pedophile greeted us at the door by saying I hope you have some patience because the staff is young. That should have been our warning to leave, but we stayed. It took 20 minutes before anyone even came over to take our drink order and another 20 minutes to get the drinks. We ordered an appetizer, salads and a couple if pizzas....30 minutes later when we asked where our salads were they brought out everything, wilted tasteless Caesar salad, cold pizza and cold calamari. We were so hungry that we just ate it, all the while shaking our heads in disbelief. I ordered a coke with my meal and when it came time for a refill they said they were out of Coke. How do you run out of Coke at a restaurant on a Friday night?! My husband asked for a water and they brought him a glass with lipstick on it, gross! I complained to the manager, but my husband told him not to worry about it, we will pay for everything. And they did just that, over $70 later for the worst meal and service ever, they didn't comp a penny. Instead, the manager came over with a cannoli and said \"since you didn't think the salad had any flavor, try this cannoli, I put extra flavor in it for you!\" Uhhhh, no thanks sicko! My husband is 100% Italian and he said this place makes him ashamed of his culture. Do yourself a favor and go to Little Caesars instead. I had to give this review 1 star to post it, it's really a big fat 0!"}
{"text":"The menu is simple and delicious. They have live music on the weekends and the outdoor seating is great! I think in the past they have had issues with poor service but have since hired new staff that were very accommodating and attentive to detail. They may still be working out the kinks but I think it has great potential. Please don't base your decision on OTHER peoples experience. Go and find out for yourself just how neat this place is. I recommend the Scallops and shrimp for appetizer and all pizzas are great. just ask for extra crispy so the center isn't too gooey"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried ViA for the first time today-   he had the spaghetti and I had a apple pecan salad-  the salad was a little on the small side for the price ( ordered it as my meal) but everything tasted fantastic.   The bread was great!!   It a nice atmosphere-  was disappointed to see so few people in there- i hope they make it-  we will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Being Italian it  is hard to find authentic Italian food and Pizza is the hardest! We visited Via last Friday 6/27/14 and ordered 2 Pizzas that were cooked crispy just the way we liked it. The Pizza was a little salty but it was enjoyable. So we thought we would try it again. We ordered the Sicilian pizza which isn't Sicilian the vegetarian and cheese ravioli's. As we all took our first bite we said how spicy and salty everything was. I have to grab some bread and water to help the taste. We told the waitress and she brought over a manager and he asked if he wanted us to cook another. So we agreed and he brought us out a taste of the sauce. It was the same so I said just tell me what I owe because I had drinks. So he came back saying he took off one pizza. Mind you the three of us only had one bit and sent it back. I laughed and said you are charging me for something I didn't eat? We'll he finally made good and Took it off. The only thing I didn't appreciate is the waitress had friend there and must have told them what we complained about as we were walking out we got the stare. As promised to the manager we will never go back."}
{"text":"Great pizza, tried the capriccosa and was pleasantly surprised. Is that homemade sauce I taste? Good selection of wines and beer. Tried the Pinot Noir and Pinot Grigio. Not sure what issue the others were having but this is a great little local spot and great music to boot. Come for happy hour and stay for dinner, it's worth it. Awesome staff, thank you Zack! We'll see you again soon!"}
{"text":"What an incredible disappointment. My wife and I were big fans of Tutti Santi and would eat there quite frequently. We drove by and seen the name change and decided today we go in for lunch. When we arrived the dining room was completely empty with only one table of diners on the patio. We were told to go ahead and sit wherever we like. Right from the get-go I felt something was off because we sat there for just under 10 min. without being greeted. I couldn't figure that out an empty dining room having to wait that long to be greeted.

Once we were greeted I ordered a beer and my wife ordered an Ice-T. The T tasted so awful that she had to return it for a Diet Coke. It took over 10 min. for me to get my draft beer too. Again there was a long wait for the server to come back to take our order. We were going to order an appetizer to start with but then when the service was so slow we decided just to have a pizza. So he ordered a pizza and then waited... And waited... And waited. 35 min. before the pizza finally arrived at first glance did not look real appealing. I said to my wife, \"doesn't look really good hopefully tastes good.\" 

Wrong. The pizza was so badly undercooked that it was basically still just dough. At this point my wife and I both concurred to and this outing calling over the waiter and asking for a check. The manager did come over and she comped the pizza and gave some excuse about that they were one cook short so it was a bit hectic in the kitchen. She did offer to put the pizza in a box but we said no thanks and left. I didn't quite buy that as it was still rather dead in the dining room. 

I'm pretty confident that we are one and done with this place."}
{"text":"Two stars for service only.  Poor girl tried hard and meant well only to be let down by the kitchen.  Pizza was barely a step above degornos, cheese ravioli so overcooked and mushy it equated to baby food.  Place was dead, should have been a sign.  Lots of competition in this category.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Locally owned and pride of ownership. The ambiance is just right and instantly makes you feel comfortable. The owner Christy always goes out of her way to make sure everyone is having a good time and is enjoying the food and wine.  The pizza is my fav! Prices are extremely reasonable. I am definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"Good place. Started with the calamari. Very tasty. My friend had a salad which she liked. Next I had the shrimp pasta. Also very good and the perfect portion. My boyfriend and friend each had chicken dishes which they scarfed down quickly. Both of them said they were delicious. We finished with a cannoli. Very good as well. The house cocktails are good and strong. We enjoyed ourselves. We will definitely return to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Via is new and has some wrinkles to iron out but overall the food is good and reasonably priced. It is nice to go to a place right near the house that is not a corporate chain. It reminds me of back home where mom and pop shops rule not like Arizona. This is the first review I have written on any web site and I cannot believe the amount of time people spend writing bad things about this restaurant. Get a life people, we all know you are experts on running a small business. It is ignorant attitudes like those of these people that makes these corporate chains take over and crush small business. I assure you these people may have their feathers ruffled because their asses were not kissed but they know NOTHING about food. I'm usually there on Friday or Saturday so if you feel inclined come down and say hi!!!

Via just keep working on the issues and I'm sure that you will survive the obnoxious, mommas boys, that want their butts wiped for them!!!!

If you are in the neighborhood give it a try you will like it!"}
{"text":"I like the charm of the Via Pizza, you can find me supporting local restaurants any meal
I got the pizza, how can you go wrong with a brick oven pizza pie.    

 I don't live in the area I was so surprised by all the corporate or chain restaurants, I enjoyed my dinner and felt that the restaurant has  nothing but growth in front of it.  The owner obviously is investing in the community and I hope more curious people stop by.
  In search of a local joint in Gilbert I came across Via, its a brick oven family Italian restaurant.  The menu is simple and the pizza selection is creative, I'm always interested to order a new kind of pizza.  


Tutti Fans,
 The restaurant is gone please deal with your problems elsewhere.  I guess Tutti Santi moved on as well, well what can I say, I like Via pizza it has class unlike the terrible reviews from below,

Jim N, Peter C. Nicole N. Luke W. Justin B. Erik S. Jen M. have a combined total of 8 reviews & 1 friend. and looks like they all  spend hours typing a poor review.
Yelp can Via get a little love here, 

Good luck Via

{"text":"Have been there twice Pizza is good. But the drinks are ridiculous the beer comes in very small glasses so does the soda. By the way there is no free refills on the soda they charge for every soda. asked the waitress about the charge and she said the only thing that is free is water. So if you come there with a family of five and have 2 sodas a piece your bill will be $20 just for the sodas thats more than the Pizza!! Live 3 blocks away will never go back! Have never been to an establishment that did not give free refills on soda. This place will never make a go of it with there practices."}
{"text":"Just fantastic.  Stopped in around 7:30 on Tuesday.  They're super friendly. The Calimari is light and crisp. Chicken Saltimboca was very tasty.  Side veggies were al dente and done perfectly. We will be back."}
{"text":"Delish!!!  My friend told me that she went here last week for happy hour and had good service and loved the Shrimp Scampi.
I decided to go today, but first read the reviews.  I was shocked, as my friend is in customer service and the food industry, and her experience was nothing like what the reviews stated.
I decided NOT to go..I chose another spot to eat.  I passed by Via and drove about 2 miles, and could not get my friends description of that Scampi out of my head.  I turned around...Man, am I glad that I did!!  Sandy greeted me by opening the door as I was entering.  She was informative, friendly, cute hair and she made me feel comfortable.  I had the ceasar salad (pretty good, a little too much heart of the romaine though, but dressing was good)  The shrimp scampi truly was to die for!!  My new neighborhood spot.  Clean, friendly, and efficient so I'm not sure what's up with all of the other reviews, but clearly they have stepped it up multiple notches, or there are just a bunch of unhappy humans in general.  .Keep it up, I want to go here often."}
{"text":"CLOSING. I've never been in to actually eat because the day we went in...well, the friendly waitstaff welcomed my fiancé and I warmly. Only thing was.... they found out that very day that they're closing down! So we had to leave. :-( What a shame. I never got to try them out. 5 stars for the friendly waitstaff. :-)"}
