{"text":"I dined here on Saturday night and three days later I still can't get over how amazing the meal was.  I stayed mainly with the veggie dishes and the seafood and none of them disappointed.  The presentation of each dish added so much to the entire experience.  Service was excellent and the decor was upscale.  Partage can give most other restaurants on the Strip a run for their money.  Get in there now before it becomes one of the most sought after reservations in Vegas.  I can't wait to get back there."}
{"text":"Exceptional french restaurant! The design, the food, the service are over the top.You will meet Chef Yuri, William, Nicolas and the french team, they treat people like family.The level of cuisine is very close to a Michelin star restaurant, for 100 dollars it is just unbelievable! minutes from the strip.
Stop spending thousands of dollars on the strip This is the new place to be :)"}
{"text":"We just stumbled on this little gem because the restaurant down the street was closed. Highly highly recommend for a date night. I leaned that Partage in French means \"share\". Be prepared to share plates
The lobster ravioli, the halibut and the 24 carrot desert are my recommends"}
{"text":"Happily surprised by the high quality/beauty of the food, friendly ambiance and good service. Great to have a good French restaurant off-Strip. Look forward to bringing friends next time. Cheers to Nicholas and William."}
{"text":"Authentic French cuisine at it's Best! 7 courses for $100, Open until 1am, Try to find another restaurant like this. You can't. Must try!"}
{"text":"What a great start! Yelp, where's this hidden extra 6th star? 5 is not enough to rate Partage.
Everything from when we walked in until we left was stunning. The design is a mix of wooden and industrial elements, dark and bold, very classy. They have large tables for parties of 8 or more, as well as smaller tables and booths. They also have a chef's table right in front of the kitchen so you can actually see the chefs at work, and a private room for 12 guests hidden behind the wine cellar.
The staff is very friendly yet super professional.
Their menu is more than engaging, with some really interesting items making you want to taste everything.
We had the Chef's special 5-course menu, where you don't know what you're gonna get and which is changing all the time - 2 appetizers, 1 fish, 1 meat and 1 dessert for $80, with an extensive selection of beverages, cocktails and wine list.
They ask you your dietary restrictions, allergies and food preferences and then compose something \"sur mesure\".
We were a party of 9 with 1 vegetarian and had such a great culinary experience, all of us!
Everything was really delicious. My favorite that night was the seared scallop with seaweed, pickled mushrooms and a dashi broth. Yum!!
I can't wait to try this place again and I wish them the best of luck."}
{"text":"Great French restaurant off the strip that has a hip and elegant decor with amazing attentive service. Food is excellent, and you don't have to pay an exorbitant price for it. Parking is easy, and getting in and put is hassle free, unlike many of the high-end restaurants on the strip. The duck was superb, and the small bites including the bone marrow were all flavorful. There are many options on the menu, and if you cannot decide, let the chef decide for you from their 5 course, 7 course, or  9 course rotating  prefix menue. Definitely plan to come back often to this gem."}
{"text":"The overwhelmingly positive reviews are justified. Partage is a great addition to the Vegas dining scene as a whole and more importantly to the off-strip restaurant collection. A quick turn around of the Chada Street space is hardly noticeable as the room feels polished and well appointed. Great spaces for groups of 6-8 as well as a private dining room with a texture mapped table top (very cool).  
That being said the beautiful bar and seating areas really are a stage for the star of the show.. The Menu.. killer format and layout feature three levels of tastings as well as a vast assortment of small plates broken down into vegetable, seafood and meat categories. Prices are low and portion sizes small so a single person can easily consume 4-7 depending on appetite. The two of us tried 12 including dessert and left pretty full. 
Highlights were Scallop, Pea soup, Oxtail toast, Egg parfait, Squash Blossoms. 
Wine list is Concise, French & Delicious. Had a premiere cru Chablis that worked wonderfully with the delicate hand of the chef.  Seasoning is restrained and flavors are apparent, crafted and yet not overwhelming. 
Dessert service is from a cart and whimsical items such as 24C Gold carrot profiterole and Baked Alaska (flambé) headline a very fresh and delicate program. 
Looking forward to my next stop in to try the remainder of the menu."}
{"text":"What a great experience at the newest restaurant in Chinatown. Don't let the location fool you, Partage is French fine dining at off the strip prices. 

Chef Yuri (fresh off winning Chopped) has created a restaurant to be proud of here. The ambiance and decor is impeccable. The service is top notch and the bar game on point. What I really appreciated was the \"extras\". They really understand presentation at Partage. From letting you choose your own steak knife, to presenting the steak smoking in its own container tableside, and just the Many touches to make the experience memorable, I was impressed.

I ordered a series of smaller plates, including the baked Alaska for dessert. Some of the dishes were better than others but nothing disappointed. The ribeye steak was really delicious. Hickory smoked and cooked to perfection with a side of beef au jus. I loved the Smokey old fashioned. Presentation also amazing and a really unique take with the Laphroaig. My only two complaints: the iced tea was not really successful. I'd rethink it, chef. Lol

Also they really really need a starch of some kind. Potatoes in some form on the menu. Especially if they're serving amazing steaks. It's brand new and I'm sure they'll be making changes as time goes on.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"PARTAGE remember this name... After EATT, Partage! Beautiful, elegant, chic New French Restaurant in town. Away from the Strip but close enough if you stay on the Strip. The ambiance is chaleureux, moderne and raffinée.
I Love the Chef table (6 max) where you can see the Chef and his cook prepare your dinner! Such a beautiful ballet to see.
The restaurant also offer a private room for 12 which is great if you have a business dinner or a private event.
We started with the Passion Fruit Rosemary  and the Belle journée cocktails. 
I actually enjoyed both ... 
we were excited to try everything, hard choice to make so we decided to order the 5 courses meal."}
{"text":"Overall, Partage is an excellent showcase for the chef's modern French cooking, but needs to do more to justify the price tag at least as to the tasting menu.  The setting is quite nice with only a few changes from the prior Chada Thai. The three of us had the seven course tasting menu.  Overall the food was excellent; farm fresh ingredients, great technique and taste, and excellent presentation. The dessert cart was a big hit.  We tried the baked Alaska, which was flambéed at table side. Two of us had the wine pairing.  The five glasses were generally well paired (though fairly small tastes), other than dessert where the Riesling didn't mesh with the sweet and rich desserts. Overall the food excellent.

I thoroughly enjoyed the meal. But I don't think we would do the tasting menu again.  The bill came to almost $600 for three with one round of cocktails and two wine pairings but I don't think the choice of dishes on the tasting menu justified it. For instance, the pork main was excellent but a small strip of a pork chop is not usually the centerpiece of a $100 tasting menu. Next time we will try the a la carte menu which had more interesting ingredients that didn't show up on the tasting menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. Delicious food and beautiful decoration. Great experience in town. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Partage is one of the best new modern French restaurants in Las Vegas. Upon walking in you are greeted with a smile. The food, service & its presentation were non-stop excellent. The staff were so friendly & inviting. This place will be one of our favorite places to eat in Las Vegas. Highly recommended to everyone."}
{"text":"What a great surprise!! They nailed it. Food, service and ambiance are all wonderful. The room is a perfect balance of elegant and rustic. Tables are comfortably spaced. The room is beautifully lit with well chosen music at just the right volume to notice but not interfere  with conversation. Dress up!! The room will make you look great. Service was friendly and professional from the moment we entered. Our waitress was  welcoming and helpful with all our questions. The entire team operated smoothly. We had the 9 course tasting menu. The food was excellent and the courses perfectly paced. It is food that inspires conversation. Ostensibly simple ingredients were elevated to a rare high level of execution. \"Top shelf\" ingredients were allowed to shine, flavors all well defined and balanced. The cooking is truly exceptional. After a nice salmon croquet amuse bouche, the first course was an asparagus soup. What was presented was a tiny, beautiful serving in a cute bowl of asparagus and vegetables with the broth poured over table side. My first thought was \"oh shit, tiny precocious fussy food\" I'm happy to be wrong. It was an insane burst of flavor, bright, refreshing savory, sweet. Amazing. It set the bar for the rest of the meal and the kitchen did not disappoint. The meal followed with tuna tartar, an interesting and delicious egg parfait, salmon, thai snapper, duck, beef, cheese, pastry. Add a couple glasses of rose champagne and it was one of our best meals in a long time."}
{"text":"Second place for the French dream team, chefs Yuri, Vincent, Aymeric, Gabriel, Sabine (sorry if I forget any) and manager Nicolas.
What a fabulous place with a very high-class decor !
The food is as great as Eatt and I can't wait to try more.
Congratulations on your new venture and we wish you good luck and a lot of success !!"}
{"text":"This is honestly a hidden gem. When you get in, you will love the sophisticated interior design. The cocktails that William makes are awesome, and the food was beyond my expectations. I recommend to take the pata negra as a small dish, and the lobster as the main dish, the presentation that comes with it won't disappoint you! The price is also reasonable compare to the strip!"}
{"text":"Okay, here we go!
My first visit last night with a big group of wine professionals . . . and EVERYONE was blown away!!!
I've eaten at their sister restaurant eatt several times and I've always enjoyed it . . . so I had a pretty good idea about what to expect.  But this was totally over the top and beyond sensational.
The evening started with a warm and friendly greeting by EVA the hostess. Ran into a good friend and enjoyed a cocktail at the bar with KELLY who couldn't have been more charming.
What really blew us away was how quickly they remodeled and redecorated from the former establishment (and by the way, Chada Street was one of my absolute favorite restaurants in town . . . very sad when they closed).
Lounge area is very comfortable and probably one of the best places to meet up after work for a quick bite and a cocktail.
FOOD was exceptional, SERVICE was outstanding and AMBIANCE is very inviting . . . oh, and it's pretty reasonably priced for the level of cuisine.  They've just opened so it may take a while for the wine program to develop and evolve but these guys really know what they're doing so I'm sure that it will get to where it needs to be soon.
I would encourage ANYONE who enjoys fine dining, and doesn't want to get ripped off on the strip, to check this out before it becomes nearly impossible to get a table."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place and it is fantastic!  Highly recommend trying this unique spot with smaller, sharing portions!"}
{"text":"Intimate elegant restaurant with creative cocktails and wine list.
Great service.
We had the 7 courses tasting menu : each plate was exceptional, artisticaly presented. It is always nice to be introduced to new tastes at each bite. Creative chef, you will want to return and forget about the big chef names of the strip French or American."}
{"text":"Incredible restaurant. The quality of a very high end strip restaurant at substantially lower prices.

This is a spot for the discerning foodie!"}
{"text":"It was my 3rd time to Partage. The old Chada street, changed owner, got a lifting and became one of the best spot for great food, cocktail and ambiance.
Last Night I organized an event in the private room and what an Amazing night! They orgonized a tasting menu in advance. When the guest arrived, they assisted to a light show on the table, everybody was blown away... the five course tasting menu have been serve with wine pairing with a perfect sequence of service. All Servers were smiley, discret and professionally present at the same time. My guest could not stop talking about the food. ( they are professional from the industry).
The event was a success and I have to say the most important for me was the satisfaction of my guest.
Partage score big! The event was very reasonably priced and I definitely got more for my money than what I expected. I will definitly come back very soon and will not hesitate to do my next event at the same place."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! We were lucky enough to come across this gem on Spring Mountain! The service was phenomenal as well as the food!"}
{"text":"My bf and i 9rdered 5 course meals, a glass of wine & a sparkling water. Every plate was fresh & delicious. All staffs are nice and friendly, explained well about every plate we were gettin. Definately comin back! Thanks :)"}
{"text":"A great experience. From delicious cuisine to awesome service and tasty cocktails. The chef also comes out to present the dishes. Definitely a place where you can bring your date or friends with confidence."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic. The server took time to explain the menu . Great happy hour with 50% off bottles and cocktails. Food was delicious and would definitely return again soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic place, food, and people. Partage is the new best restaurant in town. Vegas was waiting for a long time for a restaurant like that. The Decor is chic and sophisticated. The food is of the highest kind. I recommend to everybody to try this new Vegas gem."}
{"text":"The 5 star rating for Partage is legit. I haven't been this excited for a new restaurant in ages.

This is going to be a long review, so for those looking for the cliff notes version, here it is:
Taste: 5 stars
Ingredients: 5 stars
Ambiance: 5 stars
Presentation: 5 stars
Drinks: 5 stars
Service: 5 stars
Chef: 5 stars + he's ridiculously good looking

Had friends in town from LA and wanted a nice meal without necessarily going to the strip. Our taste buds are squarely in the Vitner Grill, Andre's Bistro, Sage, Herringbone, and Bardot range. I read on Eater about Partage, saw the amazing reviews, and booked immediately.

The menu undersells this place. While I love pithy descriptions, each dish came out bigger, better, and more interesting than we expected.

Tucked in an unassuming (read: shitty) strip mall, much like how lotus of Siam was in the middle of what looks like downtown Detroit, Partage takes advantage of what I imagine to be super cheap rent and passes those savings onto the diner.

The menu was too good for us to do the tasting menu. Between the 4 of us, we ordered the lobster ravioli, egg/roe/uni trilogy, oyster trilogy, quail with foie gras, prime rib, broccoli, king crab with roe, squash blossom, scallop, oxtail with truffle oil, and 5 desserts.

Oh yeah, did I mention Partage is like French tapas? Small plates meant for sharing. Large plates meant for serious sharing. And with super friendly prices ($8-12 for most), we didn't feel bad trying everything! Every dish was amazing. The Hollandaise sauce around one of the oysters was to die for. The sea urchin flavoring in one of trilogies was a favorite. The KING CRAB. We had to re-order because it was so good. And while the menu lists these as \"a piece\", it was enough for a small meal and all 4 of us could try everything.

Presentation was right on...the Michelin scale. Like 3 star Michelin scale.

I haven't even gotten to the best part. The drinks were tremendous. I am a sucker for a good French 75. Partage took that to the next level and added bitters so it wouldn't be so sweet (also reduce hangovers). Simple yet brilliant. We had old fashioneds coming out of table side smokers. A delicious mezcal drink on ice. And huge wine pours (each wine order came with a little side carafe). We drove here, thinking it would be a nice, civil dinner, but after seeing the first few drinks, we had to play Rock Paper Scissors for DD. I lost. But can't be too sad after this experience.

We're not big dessert people but we wanted to see how Partage handled desserts. (Too full at the point for cheese so must come back for the cheese). Our servers wheeled out a cart. Had mango macaroons (omg), poured fire over a baked Alaska, and serviced mini cakes on platters. We were floored while eating our way to food heaven. 

To cap out this fantastic experience, Chef Yuri, who I would expect to be January if there was a master chef studs calendar, came out to greet all the diners. The divorcees next to us squealed. I couldn't since husband was next to me.

Despite our party ordering two 18oz prime ribs, numerous drinks, over a dozen small plates, and five desserts (yeah yeah I had the extra dessert since I had to be DD), our bill came out to under $150 a person.  So we will be back - for any occasion - and just cross our fingers this place won't blow up in popularity so much that we can't get another reservation."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service.  We will return. Kind of nice to have a French Restaurant in China Town."}
{"text":"I had a nice birthday dinner. They get 4 out of 5 because only two dishes crossed into the mindblowingly good category, though none were any worse than good.

Going through the items:

I started with a broccoli mini dish that was tasty. 4/5.

First appetizer was a chilled cantaloupe soup. I'm not usually a cantaloupe fan, but this was tasty and nicely presented. 4.5/5.

Second appetizer was boiled flattened octopus with squid. Kind of like a bruschetta but with octopus instead of bread on the bottom. Creative and tasty. 4.75/5.

Third appetizer was an egg dish, the first mindblowing dish of the night. A few other things went into it, and the flavors meshed perfectly. 5/5.

First entree was cod with some asparagus and Brussels sprouts. They cooked the cod quite well. As a whole, the dish was enjoyable but nothing beyond what I've had at some other restaurants. 4.25/5.

Final entree was a steak dish with mushrooms. Very, very good. Second mindblowing dish of the noght. 5/5.

Next came the cheese. I haven't been so wild about some cheese plates I've had in the past and don't care for intense cheeses. Luckily these were all delicious. 4.75/5

Finally the dessert, homemade ice cream with fresh fruit on the bottom. High quality stuff. I'm not a big ice cream fan but I still enjoyed. 4.5/5.

Overall, at $100 for seven courses at the quality they provide, both in food and service, it is a good deal and worth a visit, particularly for a special occasion."}
{"text":"What a great experience off the strip, we absolutely loved everything about this place. It's a little hidden gem off of Spring Mountain.  The minute you walk in, the ambiance begins. The hospitality and presentation of the cocktails and entree--two thumbs up  We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Went to Partage for the first time last night and had an incredible time. 
I have enjoyed a variety of incredible dishes such as the Halibut, the squid, the lobster, the oxtail beef and the sweet pea
Tasted as good as it looked 

Great staff including the bartenders and of course the exec team. 
Thank you Vincent Pellerin and Nicolas Kalpokdjian
Now I need to go back to meet chef Yuri!!

Excellent job to the entire Partage team"}
