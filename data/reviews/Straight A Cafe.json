{"text":"Great service! I am not the biggest fan of their coffee but I am a picky about coffee. If you are looking for a quick bite to eat or pick-me-up on campus, this is the place."}
{"text":"Tasty and easy when I don't have a long lunch break, or when I want breakfast during class.  Some favorites: pastrami panini, chicken artichoke panini, vegetable quesadilla, grilled cheese with tomato, some of their breakfast specials"}
{"text":"This cafe is located at A.T. Still University in the main building. Tons of faculty, students, and employees come here to eat breakfast or lunch. 

Overall, their daily specials aren't bad. I've tried their egg salad and loved their Chicken Panini. Haven't tried the coffee yet, but its a popular choice among students. It's easy, quick, and convenient. The staff here are super friendly, always giving you a fork or spoon even if you didn't purchase anything!"}
