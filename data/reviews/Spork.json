{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and was so excited while waiting for this place to open. Since the Quiet Storm closed and its proposed successor (a sandwich shop) didn't move in, there has been a definite hole in Penn Avenue. I could not be more excited with the design, decor, and food /drink offerings! I've been three times and can't wait to go again.   Although the drink list is rather small, everything I've tried so far has been delicious and well balanced. The wine list offers some great common and less common varietals, and what I've been recommended has been well matched to my food. Although the plates are small, they tell you this up front and recommend 3-4 items per person. Since this is my preferred way to dine, this works out well for me. I think my favorites have been the pasta rags (torn sheets of pasta) with duck speck, the tortellini soup (sounds boring but the pasta is so tender and the cheese inside is so gooey), and the chestnut gnocchi. Everything here is hand made in house and of great quality. Another great reason to come to Penn Avenue in Friendship!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but based on what we tried, the food was just average. My husband and I had the jerk chicken, lamb meatballs and for the main prime strip and squid ink pasta with octopus. We thought the best dish out of the 4 was the lamb meatballs. The steak was underseasoned and the sautéed kale, which tasted pickled, overpowered the entire dish. The squid ink pasta with octopus was on the salty side according to my husband. We expected a lot more, especially for the price point. I'd like to give this place another chance but with so many other great options in Pittsburgh, I'm not so sure if we'll be returning."}
{"text":"Really beautiful space. Bar is very cozy and open at the same time. Overall, though, it is not very thoughtful in anything but decor. Prices seem good until you see the portions. Mediocre service.   Uninspired beer list. Cocktails are overly sweet. Wine list is good."}
{"text":"Amazing! Every bite is just so very good. Be prepared to spend some money - portions are astoundingly tiny (in my experience the pasta dishes give you slightly more mass for your dollar) but totally worth it!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most unacceptably disappointing restaurants I have experienced in Pittsburgh. All dishes seem to have been reheated and either comically under seasoned or painfully over seasoned. The service was curiously condescending and disengaged. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Maybe I have just been stopping in at the wrong times but I haven't been impressed. Cool atmosphere for a drink but over-priced and limited menu. While the menu changes daily, I haven't been in and found something that stood out to me. Expensive but good cocktails and wine."}
{"text":"Came here with a girlfriend last night.  We sat at the counter overlooking the kitchen, and it was fun to watch the chefs the whole time.  The food was beautiful and delicious, and the wait staff was very attentive.  The plates are small but fantastic, and because it's a leisurely experience, you do get full.  We had two appetizers, two of the bigger \"entrees,\" shared a dessert, and we were stuffed.  An absolute gem of a place!  Great for a date when you're not in a rush or for a group of girls who like to try a few bites of everything.  I would highly recommend it if you're looking to try a new place!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this new restaurant.  We go out at least 3-4 times a week for dinner and had heard such good things about Spork.  We logged in to the no wait app and when we arrived our table was ready.  We were immediately taken to our table and given our menus.  The menu looked awesome - So far so good.  Then we sat...and sat...  We sat for almost 15 minutes without anyone coming to our table.  My fiancé went up to the bar to try and get us water and our drinks.  There was only one bartender and he was doing mostly  service. Our waitress did come to the table while he was at the bar and brought us water.  She was clearly in the weeds as well.  My fiancé continued to stand at the bar for another 10 minutes without receiving our drinks, we did what we have never done before - we left.  It is such a shame - spork had a nice vibe and the day's menu looked great. They really need to work on the service side of this restaurant because they won't be the \"In\" place forever."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise!  So many delicious options to choose from.  Our group ordered 12 different plates and every single item was delightful.  The pasta was fresh and the seasonings were delectable and interesting.  It was a pleasant surprise to be served by a mature wait staff that clearly knew what they were doing, worked as a team and understood everything on the menu.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had a nearly perfect foodie experience here, as well as a really good time. We opted to sit at the chef's counter, which I highly recommend unless you're looking for a quiet and/or private vibe. The food was uniformly creative, well-executed, and yummy. The portions, even on the \"small plates,\" were very generous - ignore the 2 to 2.5 selections per person recommendation at your own peril - we left thanksgiving level stuffed, with a doggie bag. Our favorites were the scallops with butternut ravioli, the braciola, and the stuffed quail. Great waitstaff, really know the food and happy to help you make choices. And after all that, a very reasonable price for the quality and quantity of the food. No excuses: get there."}
{"text":"Great dinner, service, and atmosphere. Only reason not 5 stars is menu could use a few more non-meat options."}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about this restaurant. Overall, it had a nice & cozy atmosphere and the food was delicious, but as previous reviewers have noted the portions were laughably small for the price.  I had looked up reviews beforehand, and though many people had commented on the portion sizes I really wasn't expecting them to be as small as they were.  I thought that maybe people were being overly critical since it's a new restaurant, but I was wrong.  When we ordered our food, our server recommended ordering 3-4 plates per person and he wasn't kidding.  Everyone in my group ordered 1-2 plates (mainly because the dishes were more expensive than we anticipated) and that was definitely not enough for each person.  I understand that the size of a typical tapas/small plates meal is going to be smaller than a regular restaurant, and the idea is to share with your table so everyone gets a little bit of everything.  However, these meals weren't large enough to consider sharing.  I ordered the flatbread with lamb sausage and the ravioli, which were $10 and $8 respectively.  The flatbread was one triangular piece with a single sausage link and some toppings, and there were only 3 pieces of ravioli with the pasta dish.  The food tasted amazing, but I'm not sure how I was expected to share such a small amount, and the portions didn't justify the price in any way.  Someone in my group ordered the mussels and another ordered a burger, those seemed to be the only decently-sized meals.  The only thing that really saved the day was the cookie table that we ordered for dessert.  It comes with a variety of different cookies and a pitcher of milk, for those that like milk with cookies. And the cookies were just as delicious as the rest of the menu!  I consider myself a bit of a cookie snob (I grew up on cookies made from scratch) and these definitely get my seal of approval.  And there were plenty of cookies to share, so we were able to fill up on dessert to make up for the meal.    I think this place is definitely worth giving a try, the food is too good to go unappreciated.  But I would recommend going when you're not very hungry, or be prepared to spend a lot of money."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating at Spork! I wasn't sure what to expect but I left loving it.  For drinks, I ordered the silent demise, it was very different and so good.  And as a fun detail, this drink was served in a skull mug!!! I love stuff like that, so I was extra excited.  I ordered multiple appetizers and they were all delicious. I did order a few of the \"entrees\" to split as well, and I did like the appetizers much better than the entrees.  But this is a very unique place with great ambiance and decor.  I will absolutely be going back!"}
{"text":"Spork has finally opened! The atmosphere here is spectacular. As soon as you walk through the front door, you will notice the gorgeous chandeliers and candlelit tables. This is the kind of place that is perfect for a date and also fun with a group of people. I ordered the lowball cocktail and the earl grey was a nice addition to this cocktail. I can't wait to try some of the mocktails as they sound quite tasty too. We were originally just going in for drinks but one look at the menu and we had to order something! I tired the tofu, mango, roti dish and really enjoyed the mix of the somewhat spiciness of the tofu paired with the cool mango. For desert, the tres leches did not disappoint. It was plated beautifully and tasted great. The portions at Spork are perfect for the price. I can't wait to order a few small plates the next time that I go, which will be quite soon!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place!! I have tried Spork once & will never go back. The aesthetic inside has a rather cute rustic/hipster vibe. Our waitress was very attentive, however not very nice or approachable. In asking her to explain some of their wine selections she was extremely condescending & not very knowledgeable. I ordered the burger & the bun was so dry/old it was inedible. There were also ingredients that came on it that weren't listed on the menu including a sauce. I get the image this place is trying to portray, but if you're going to do it at least do it right. I can't speak for the other three people I ate with, however they had at least 6+ other menu items & didn't finish any of them either."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great! They make their own pasta, charcuterie, bread, and gelato. They pickle their own vegetables, and spice their own olives. The servers are fantastic. They are friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, and are not afraid to make suggestions. The ambience is wonderful. The wine list has great wines. The prices on everything are great values. The food is phenomenal!!! A must try place. You will become a regular."}
{"text":"Solid food. Amply sized small plates. Short, but good cocktail list. There were a few wrinkles in the service, but nothing outright bad. Just things I'd chock up to it being the opening week. I'm curious to see how frequently the menu changes, but based on our first visit I am optimistic that we've found a local go-to spot to take the place of Salt."}
{"text":"Chic joint that was transformed from vegan diner to funky tapas like eats.  My wife enjoyed it and suggested I try too so I came with colleagues from Atlanta and Chicago so no strangers to food.  Overall I liked it.  Vibe is cool and casual, cocktails are trying to be clever and good but not great.   Maybe they will get there.  Service was very informative albeit measured (like slow but with some flair).  We ate 15 things and all good.  Loved the goat cheese jar, the raviolis, the BBQ duck was amazing.   Pear salad was solid, mushrooms need a redo but that about the only sub par item.  Reasonable price and a winner overall in my book.  Glad these place keep coming!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have a feeling Spork will be added to our list of regulars in Pittsburgh that we choose last minute for weekend dinners. We decided to try Spork on a whim two weeks ago and landed two seats at the bar. The restaurant was extremely lively and has an open kitchen with an industrial yet comfortable atmosohere  I opted for a Cabernet Sauvignon, Rock & Vine, which has made its way to my iPhone list of wines to buy next time I'm at the store, delicious. My boyfriend experimented with the cocktail list and didn't have any complaints.  For apps we split the arancini, which was ridiculously good and true arancini, unlike Bar Marco's which we tried a week later. I also tried the grilled peaches and burrata. Oh my god true summer flavors in your mouth.  Dinner however was where the experience went south. My boyfriend got the Tagliatelle and loved it, I ordered the chestnut gnocchi. Five minutes after his meal I still didn't have mine, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, still not out. The bartender kept claiming they were \"slammed\" yet people who arrived later than us were getting multiple dishes delivered. 30 minutes later after I said not to bring it out as it was too late but the manager came over with my meal, apologized profusely, took it off our tab, and gave me a complimentary dessert.   If there's one thing I care about most at restaurants, it's customer service and how they handle  less than ideal situations. Spork did it the right way, and my S'mores dessert was quite possibly the most delicious restaurant dessert I've had in a while. I have an affinity for s'mores that seems to pop up every time I look at the restaurant menu, so naturally I had to try this at Spork.   While my meal came extremely late, Spork made up for it in drinks, ambiance, and customer service. See you again soon Spork!"}
{"text":"Nice vibe, sexy lighting and interesting cocktails make Spork a hip spot for a bite and a sip. The design of the space is quite nice with multiple options of seating style, some overlooking the food prep, some at the bar and some looking out onto Penn Ave. While I appreciate trying new flavor combinations, there can be a point where creativity has gone too far. For me, Sporks version of the Cesar Salad using a soured cheese and charred romaine tasted almost awful. The char smelled and tasted more like burn although the leaves did not appear to be. My main dish was a Jerk Tuna small plate which again was complex in flavor, but this time done very well.  I will return but will do so knowing that Sporks chefs like to be adventurous."}
{"text":"A lovely birthday dinner we had tonight! We came in around 6 and the place was half full. So no wait and we picked a nice table with couch. We brought our 2yr old kid and found out the restaurant is not really interested in kids. No high chair and kids menu. Which for us is totally not a big deal. The music was loud, so if she was having difficult time not all guests would be bothered ;-)  Our waiter, i think his name was Tony, was really nice. Very clear and on point.  We started with some breads and spreads, lovely. Also the goatcheese spread was really delicious.  After that lamb meat balls and peach with ricotta in flatbread. Both dishes very fresh with a lot of flavor.  Another course with veal tagliatelle and buckwheat tart. I didn't try the tagliatelle and my husband was actually not hungry anymore. Our kid loved it!  The tart was so so, some pieces of fennel where very sour.   Overall a great experience and I'm happy that we went here!"}
{"text":"Really amazing food and superb cocktails! Highly  recommend sitting at the chefs table. I really enjoyed what I ordered but seeing the other options being made in front of you makes you want to come back and get it. I definitely will!"}
{"text":"Stopped by with 2 friends after the Garfield gallery crawl and it was exceptional.  We each had a pizza(mushroom, tomato basil and pepperoni).  Each pizza was cooked perfectly and the crust was amazing.  Legitmately some of the best pizza you will find.  Check it out.  Grab a Number 11 drink.  Fantastic"}
{"text":"People...get your booties here asap! What a way to spend my first night in Pittsburgh.  The restaurant has ample table seating, but on a Friday they were booked so we got a reservation on the bar.   Service was great. Our waiter painted the prettiest picture of every item on the menu it was hard to make a decision. The chef even came out to see how we were enjoying everything. Top notch!   Starter: Scallops with some ravioli. So good! Is it acceptable to lick ones plate in public??? No?!? Ok I didn't, but thought about it.  Main Course: Smoked Brisket Ravioli. I thought I wasn't a fan of brisket. Well Spork changed that. This entree is a home run and you won't be disappointed.  Dessert: I can't remember the name, but it had peaches and ice cream. Ummm I def are it all, bc it was delicious!  Thanks Spork for a great meal!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first dining experience as Spork and living right down the street we are sure to return. We started with some interesting cocktails from the bar and the breads and spreads (gorgonzola butter was amazing). My husband and I shared 2 bites, and 3 tapas, and finished with a pasta. The pasta was homemade and fantastic- I will definitely be ordering another one next time. For any vegetarian friends I highly recommend the fauxlafel- it was fantastic. And if you're a meat eater make sure you don't miss the jerk chicken- it's super spicy and smoky but a very generous serving size. Don't forget to save room for the cookie board- we didn't and regretted it!"}
{"text":"The food was quite tasty and wine list great. I like that you can get small pours; they might consider adding wine flights to the menu. Great ambiance. I have only two complaints - pricey- the small plates really add up, and I am not totally convinced the quality warranted the price point. The other was that the service, while pleasant, was slow. We sat for quite a while forlornly waiting for our first drink. I wavered between 3 and 4 stars - really 3.5."}
{"text":"I wanted to love Spork. I'd heard highly complimentary things about their food. So. I visited last Friday night. The wait staff was great, attentive and non-hovering. The food presentation was lovely. But, I found problems with the food. Here's what I ordered: zucchini croquettes with garlic aioli. 4 to an order, shaped like little cigars, coated in panko, deep fried and topped with garlic aioli. A little over browned and slightly over salted. 2nd plate - my favorite: diver scallops with butternut squash ravioli - lovely (kinda salty). Beef/veal/pork meatball with tomato sauce - my favorite - very tender and nicely sauced. Gnocchi with wild mushrooms and goat cheese - total fail - hard, greasy, gut bombs. Mushrooms were ok. Never found the goat cheese. Many positives. My main complaint deals with seasoning."}
{"text":"This was the first time I couldn't finish a dish because it was that terrible. Maybe it was an off night? Maybe one of their ingredients went bad? I don't know what happened, but I won't be coming back. There are much better places in the area that are a lot less expensive!"}
{"text":"The food was great. The ambience is very cool. The service was sub par. The waiter did not write down our order and forgot to enter one of our plates. The four plates we received all came out at the same time, appetizer, salad, pasta, and entree. I had assumed a fancy place like spork would know to send out one course at a time. The waiter left another table's dirty beer glass on our table. I don't drink, and found this disgusting. The food was good enough, I would probably go back. I will be waiting a while, hopefully the staff will be better trained in time"}
{"text":"I don't know if the food was not that good or my expectations were too high... First, I looked online and called and they said no reservations, which is fine, but we get there and everyone is using NoWait, which is also fine, but can you please tell people that when they call to make reservations??? I could have done that instead, but no we have to wait 45 minutes for a table. That was frustrating on its own.  Then when we sit, no one comes over for a really really long time. Then finally someone, who brings us water but can't take our order... We must have waited 10 minutes to see a waitress... I understand being busy, but acknowledge the table.   2 items we ordered were out, it seemed like they were not prepared at all for the dinner rush (staff or food). Then the food we got was just ok. There was nothing amazing, which is what I expected.   Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Great little BBQ situation outside in open areas next to Spork. Lots of tables, umbrellas and space.  Had the Ribs, buddy had the Brisket. Side of mac and greens.  Greens are , give'em a splash of vinegar.   Mac was okay.  Ribs were moist, tender with a hint of smoke. I prefer more dry rub/seasoning.  There's two cuts of brisket, my not-so-bright 'buddy' got the \"lean\" brisket...who does that!!??   Get fatty cut, lean was dry, as it has to be.   They are open Wednesday and Saturday. And will be open 6 days a week in threee months, down the street near Penn dairy, or something."}
{"text":"Came here last night for a special occasion dinner after having had my eye on Spork for a while on my commutes to and from work, and man, we weren't disappointed. Our waiter recommended that we stick with 2-3 small plates per person, so we ordered 5 in total: one off the tapas menu (eggplant croquettes, so freaking good), two bites (merguez sausage and scallops), one pasta (smoked brisket ravioli), and one item off of the \"composed\" list (braciola). Everything we ordered was not only delicious, but also seasonal, so we availed of a variety of earthy flavors (think butternut squash, sage, currants, mushrooms, citrus accents). I was impressed with the size of the portions--between the two of us, we weren't able to finish our 5th plate. They also did a great job of staggering the plates so we had the feeling of a well-timed multi-course dinner. We had started with some house cocktails (pretty good, but the star of the show was the food) and ended with espresso. The ambiance is beautiful (also, they do give you an actual spork along with the rest of your silverware--pretty cute, guys). Overall, I can't wait to go back to try another seasonal menu."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Great food, and the best service I have had in Pittsburgh. My water never got low. The portions were small considering the price, but they are tapas, so it comes with the territory. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, but the hostess completely blew it in terms of expectations on wait time. We used No Wait to get in line at 6:30 for an 8 pm dinner with a party of 4. The hostess refused to give us an ETA for dinner and then kept telling us we would be \"the next small table.\"  The bar was packed so we couldn't even order drinks. At 8:30 we again asked the hostess and she wouldn't give an estimate. We waited until 8:45, and then my wife who is pregnant had to leave because she was too hungry.  We told the hostess, and I walked my wife to the parking lot on the other side of Penn Ave. Almost as soon as I got back, they finally offered us a spot at the counter by the kitchen.  Why didn't the hostess tell us before my wife walked out?!  Just a total lack of common sense.  The meal was fine, great meatballs, but the server took forever to take our drink order and the drinks (wine and beer - not cocktails) were slow to come. They clearly have some kinks to work out, and we will not be going back on a weekend night."}
{"text":"I love small plates. I live for small plates because I'm petite and don't eat much and I'm always interested in trying everything on the menu. But this place is just a fat hell no.   The small plates are $12. For $12 I am expecting a medium plate (not to be a sarcastic ass but in Chicago, a five star tapas restaurant they are MAXIMUM $9 a plate and completely worth it). If I am paying $12 a small plate I want more than 3 gnocchi's that aren't covered in chunky weird goat cheese sauce and weird out of place soggy almonds. Honestly, had I seen one of their tapas pasta dishes prior to ordering them I wouldn't have. They were literally insultingly small but I guess I didn't mind they were so small because I didn't have much of the gross flavor to choke down.   The ONLY thing that was worthwhile was the jerk chicken and even that was slimy. From the server forgetting for an Hour to put our food in, to the check being $126 for FOUR small plates and two glasses of wine, this pretentious restaurant can shove their over-cooked gnocchi up their asses. I will not return and I'll tell everyone I know not to either."}
{"text":"I am so excited I got the chance to visit Spork this past Friday for dinner! Despite being off the beaten path of the usual busy spots of town, it was worth the trip down the road for a great meal and experience.    We had a reservation for 7:30 and were seated at a high top in the corner.  The restaurant itself is dark and romantic - very chic. Loved the mood of it inside.  It was busy and I am pretty sure almost every other table was full. Our server was very nice, but didn't engage much with us.  Some people may like not being bothered with conversation, but I wouldn't have minded a little more chit chat with him while we were there.  We started with a bottle of the Cabernet and the balsamic goat cheese eggplant appetizer.  It came with piping hot, crispy pieces of toast and was so so good.  For my meal, I had the scallops and squash ravioli off of the small plates menu and my date had the sweet potato gnocchi that came with shrimp in a pesto cream sauce.  It didn't appear that they had a Lenten menu and I don't believe we were made aware of any specials, but the normal menu had enough of a fish option to be in the clear. (Though the smoked brisket rav and rack of lamb sounded YUM). Presentation was pretty and picture-worthy and the flavor was even better.  Definitely a great spot for a date night, but would've been fun for drinks and small plates/apps at the bar as well.  No complaints at all about our visit and would love to come back!"}
{"text":"Blown away.  I live down the street from Spork and finally decided to give it a shot. No regrets. It's a bit pricey, and the portions are small, but the flavor is top notch.   Favorite menu items: Spicy chicken empanadas  The wings (yes, wings. I don't know why they're on the menu, but they are the best wings I've ever had) Ceviche Smoked brisket weck  The service was great, the food was incredible, and I'd recommend this to anyone. The only downsides are the price (a little high), the serving sizes (a little small), and the unintuitive website (it's awful on mobile). Despite these shortcomings, I'd call Spork A #1, Duke of New York."}
{"text":"Great wine list, a wonderful Tapas menu, excellent desserts, and attentive service.  Keep in mind this is a small plates menu. Portions are small, however prices are quite reasonable.  I sat at the kitchen bar and it was a fun chance to watch the skills of the kitchen staff.  I didn't go for the $22 cookie plate, however I did order a marvelous Tres Leches.  This is as authentic as it gets, the chef's wife is from the Dominican Republic, and it's her recipe.  My one criticism is that some of the descriptions on the menu were slightly misleading. For example, the pasta dish listed Gorgonzola in the description, however the amount used was slight, and Parmigiana Regiano was not mentioned but it was used generously. The end result was delicious, but just a bit confusing.  This is definitely a restaurant for foodies. And for wine aficionados as well. I enjoyed an unusual Cinsault, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, and Tempranillo blend from Lebanon."}
{"text":"I recently went here with my girlfriend for date night. Didn't really know what to expect at first but the waitress was very nice and helped explain how their menu and dishes were set up. The cocktails and wine we had were delightful. I highly recommend getting the bread and spreads as well as the goat cheese eggplant jar with toast. The mussels were good but I think when we go back, which we plan on doing soon, we're gonna get more of that amazing bread and try more of the jars they have."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Very creative. We had the goat cheese and eggplant appetizer which is delicious. The bread and dips  are fun to try. . I had the barbecue brisket which was outstanding. My wife had the crab souffle. That alone was worth the trip! The orange chocolate bombe dessert was amazing. The drinks were very creative. My only complaint was it is quite noisy there. It is very hard to visit with your family. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after a long foodless day at work to graze.  Andrew the bartender knew the food and drinks they had well enough to make recommendations on pairings that were excellent.  Spicy lamb sausage : 5/5, loved the crispy tortilla thing that came as a base of the dish White bean spread with biscotti : 4/5, new taste for me, was really good. Chocolate Almond Torte: 3/5, paired with a port, nothing special but a good topper for the evening  Would definitely go again, quiet atmosphere while i was there, friendly service, interesting food, and a pleasant portion size.  Lots of things on the menu I wanted to try."}
{"text":"A beautiful venue, we were seated at the bar watching the kitchen. We were presented with a compelling menu and waited on by exceptional service.   Then things got weird.   Our vantage at the bar gave us a ringside seat to a passive-aggressive battle between front of house and the kitchen staff who each blamed the other for missed orders and wasted food. The hardest working person, the sous chef, owned his mistakes and was given the silent treatment for it. Meanwhile, the head chef slapped each protein with so much salt that my wife and I ended up with blisters on our tongues. You could film a reality TV cooking show here.   Well-meaning conversations with wait staff asking \"what was your favorite?\" led to awkward silences. They must know. I think they know? Who knows?   In the end, we spent more here than we would have at just about any Pittsburgh restaurant. We didn't finish any item we ordered and wouldn't recommend sitting by the kitchen staff. The venue is gorgeous, though, and the beer was good."}
{"text":"My experience is limited to happy hour at the bar.... which was lovely! The bar tender was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The Happy Hour specials are from 5 - 7pm and include $2 off wine and beer and they have a happy hour bar menu that includes reasonably priced options. I went for the pork tacos and a glass of Cab. We had a question about one of the kinds of wine and were offered a nice sized sample so we knew what we were ordering.  The tacos were very good! The pork was cooked well and the toppings were tasty. It did have jalapenos to add spice, but oddly, I must not have had any seeds in mine because the taco didn't really have spice to it (which I love).   The atmosphere is completely redone (the space used to be Quiet Storm, and it just feels like a whole new space now). Very modern, and on a Tuesday night it was quiet and had plenty of seats open. I've heard the weekend is very different... hard to get a space at the bar and tables are packed."}
{"text":"We had six dishes and every single one was great! And their duck breast was the best duck I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Food excellent, but pacing of dish arrival could be better.  A few times we had barely finished and the next plate arrived. It had cooled considerably before we enjoyed it. Jerk tuna was very good but incredibly spicy."}
{"text":"This place was disappointing, but let me start with the good - they're on No Wait and there's a parking lot across the street for customers. The space is great - the glass around makes way for the natural light, especially for current long summer days. Spacious seating too! Food that I liked - the pork cheeks, dulche de leche, and warm berry cake. The chef/owner walked around the dining room often to talk to customers and ask them how things were.  Now for the cons: 4/5 non-dessert items we ordered were extremely mediocre. The ceviche was ridiculously overpriced at $11 for something that didn't have any flavor or fish in it. I think I got two tiny pieces of fish and that's it. The most disappointing dish that night. The ravioli was under stuffed - very flat. The gnocchi and the sauce just didn't go together - and the gnocchi pieces were too small to get any flavor or texture. The lamb, veal, pork meatballs were unimpressive - I make better meatballs. All servings were TINY. I could count the number of prom cheek pieces on my plate, or the number of gnocchi. I know they're tapas, but I found the portions very ridiculously small. We ordered 7 things in total (including dessert) and paid close to $100 with tip for two people and I still went home feeling like I hadn't eaten anything. We ordered three rounds, but as we went on, we realized the food wasn't great, and we didn't want to waste money trying to get full there.   If you're a small eater, maybe you will feel differently. If you have a large appetite, don't bother going here. The food did not blow me away at all."}
{"text":"Although the East Liberty and Bloomfield areas have recently acquired some top-notch restaurants, it's great to have an option a bit further down on Penn Avenue in the Friendship/Garfield area. While the food at Spork is definitely \"upscale\" in price and presentation, the atmosphere is casual and cozy, with those huge windows that are great for people watching as well as letting in the light.  During our visit, service was thorough. We had, I think, about five people check on our table, deliver food, and take requests throughout the evening and each of them was professional, upbeat, and engaged with the menu options. The menus at Spork come with a pencil, so you can circle or check the dishes that you wish to order. Although Spork doesn't bill itself as a \"tapas\" restaurant, the menu is definitely arranged to suggest that multiple dishes be ordered.  And if you actually thought you were getting a large-size entree portion of something for $12, you missed the foodie explosion that's happening in Pittsburgh (and the pricing that comes with it). Being conscious of the pricing and talking to the server, we chose to order several smaller plates and bites to share.  Generally speaking, we were very happy with our menu choices. The goat-cheese spread with eggplant and toast was delicious. All of the table's pasta choices were excellent (rags with duck soppressata, tagliatelle with veal bolognese, and ravioli with butternut and sage). Seriously, these pasta dishes are something special. The crudo with walleye was both sweet and tangy, with plenty of acid to balance out the mango.   The menu is a little bit \"all over the place\" and sometimes that seemed to show. The \"bread and spreads\" should definitely have been called \"bread & oil\" since the spreads were butter, a different kind of butter, olive oil, lardo...and white bean spread. The bread was AMAZING, but we would have been much more prepared and happy with the dish if it was just \"bread and butter.\" The lamb meatballs with yogurt-cucumber sauce definitely carried the full gyro taste experience, but were dense and didn't seem as special as some of the other menu items.   The desserts were awesome. I've said in the past that I don't always think Pittsburgh restaurants, otherwise awesome, have great desserts, but recently that's changed. The chocolate-coconut \"tiramisu\" was huge, with a beautiful sponge cake and several different textures and flavors of chocolate & coconut. So good!   There will definitely be a next time. I'm already trying to figure out how to convince my seven year old picky eater that we stop by on our way home from her school, which is just a few blocks away. Definitely want to try their cocktails and burger!"}
{"text":"We had a really nice meal at Spork over the weekend, and we had been looking forward to it for a couple of weeks. I was so happy that the place settings all actually included sporks, which I think I can get behind. The place is beautiful and the light fixtures are gorgeous. The food was great----I was very impressed by the smoked trout ravioli and the shared plates that we had. I do, however, have a gripe about the shared plates---I am always annoyed when there are just 3 or something----and almost all of our appetizers came with just 3. I would rather see 4 or even 2---I think 3 is an annoying number to share.  Our server was very nice, though maybe a bit timid and not extremely attentive. When two couples make plans for dinner, and one hires a babysitter, and they take Lyft to go out for an evening, they are hoping for a long dinner with lots of food and drink. We had to call our server over at one point to order more drinks---we each had two apiece when we might have ordered three or four.  One member of our party had an empty drink for almost half an hour before we got our server's attention. We would have gotten dessert, but we actually felt that the server was not extremely interested in us ordering anything more. As I said, he was nice, but just not very attentive, which was a shame because we thought we would spend more money. As it happened, we went somewhere else after and had more drinks and desserts. This may have been an off night for the server, though, so it will not put us off of returning. We will be back."}
{"text":"I give this place 3.5 stars.   I have such mixed feelings about this place! First, as anyone who has lived in Pittsburgh a while knows, this replaced a great restaurant that closed. Next, the neighborhoods of Bloomfield/Friendship have been experiencing a boom, with many great new restaurants moving in, some which are excellent, and some which are simply okay...though nearly all are very very pricey.  So we walked in and the ambiance is great- a bustling place, even on a Monday night! We were seated by the kitchen, which was cool, as we got to see and smell everything that was cooking. We got our menus and settled in to chatting. Now my dinner partner and I can talk forever ... But it was a really long wait to get our drink orders and food orders taken. Luckily we were happily chatting the whole time...but this could be awkward for some people who are less talkative or more hungry.   Speaking of hungry...the portions here are very, very small. I know this is a fine dining trend, so I can cope, but I ordered a $7 chicken tortellini soup, and it was about 1 cubic inch of soup. It was laughably tiny! We each got drinks, and the fizz and sparkle were good- my dinner buddy is a gin fan, and liked all of the gin options. I ordered the rum/grapefruit/cayenne option- it was a little watery on the drink and too salty on the cayenne rim. So not my favorite drink for $12...not even close. I think the bartender may need some more education.  The reason I didn't give Spork the 3 stars I considered giving them- the bread & pasta! Oh my gosh, was my dish good. I had the duck and pasta \"rags\" dish (gotta work on naming, chef!), and my dinner buddy got the salmon. Both were stupendous! The breads and spreads was great to share as a starter. However with prices this high and portions this small, some kind of bread should be included.  We ordered two desserts as well- the vanilla bean ice cream (yum! A very good vanilla), and something else that I've already forgotten about, but which was good. I will be back, but the bartender needs improve a lot for me to be a regular!"}
{"text":"Finally was able to check this place out and it did not disappoint.  This is a tapas style restaurant so all the dishes are small plates.  Great way to try a little of everything from the menu and share amongst your friends or for a date night.  The pork belly, scallop and  chicken wings were my favorites.  Loved the homemade bread with the variety of spreads.  Can't wait to go back on my next visit to try all the other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"The vibe of Spork is quite strange. Lighter music with bass cranked up, so it made the venue a lot louder than is needed to be. We were seated next to the door (boo) and it was still loud. If you want to have a romantic dinner, forget it. More like a club vibe....  We ordered the goat cheese, crudo, mushrooms, pickled nectarine salad, and hay and straw pasta. - The goat cheese with eggplant marmalade comes out first. It's pretty solid, the balsamic isn't too overwhelming. - Pickled nectarine salad was interesting and bad. The fruit was all it really was, with a few pieces of greens. The pickled taste was overpowering. - Mushrooms were bland. We like the variety of mushrooms to try, but there wasn't taste. - Crudo was by far our favorite. The snapper was tasty and blended well with the pepper. - Hay and straw pasta was good, a safe option of peas and prosciutto. Can't really go wrong with it.  Service was fine. They didn't give us new plates with the dishes. The plate is small, so that wasn't helpful. The mixing of flavors wasn't good, particularly with the crudo.   It was very average overall, not sure what they're trying to go for. Not in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"The wait is interminable. We were in no wait and we showed up when we were supposed to but an hour later they still had no table for us. The food was ok. Not worth the wait for sure. Drinks are very good though."}
{"text":"A very hip spot with a nice layout. You weren't on top of each other like many other similar restaurants. Arrived at about 6:30 on a Friday night and didn't have to wait. Service was prompt although not entirely knowledgable. We had quite a few questions because the menu has some unique options. We tried the bread and spreads. The bread was freshly baked and warm. We also shared the eggplant and goat cheese dip which had such a great flavor combination, especially with the toast. My boyfriend got the duck breast confit with foie gras and tortellini. The pasta is made in-house and was delicious. The duck melted in your mouth. I tried the tomato tart. The buckwheat crust tasted almost burnt and wasn't the most palatable. It's a bit pricy and wouldn't be the best place to go if you were starving but is ok if you're just trying to munch and try some unique food."}
{"text":"For some reason I didn't think I was going to like it, but I was wrong. Everything was delicious: pasta with veal, fried risotto, salmon cake, hummus, goat cheese with eggplant, pork meatballs... Friendly service and a nice room with an open kitchen. Will be back (love that they have parking across the street)."}
{"text":"Original combinations of flavors. Great service.  Outstanding drinks--even the mocktails.  Not cheap but not outrageous.  Very hip, very cool.  A few examples of greatness.  Goat cheese with eggplant marmalade.  Prosciutto in a salad where prosciutto was the star.  Great use of nuts to add texture and crunch.  Jerked tuna served sashimi rare!  Insane desserts with marshmallow fluff, sorbet, yogurt and granola. Lots of things that should not work together that do somehow.  It's the Cockatrice of restaurants."}
{"text":"Ridiculous.  This place is sooooo good. I've tried oodles of their amazing tapas with a group of friends one night. We were all so impressed...and stuffed. Everything was so good that we left nothing to waste. Check out the wine list. It is well selected and will not disappoint. The new bartender is pretty hot as a plus.  Service was very good, not excellent. Save room for the vanilla ice cream.  I know- it sounds lame but it is THE most amazing sweet buttery creamy happiness ever."}
{"text":"Spork is an amazing experience. From the host to chef you feel welcomed! I had the quail and it was delicious! Tonight I had Spork Pit (right outside) I had the Brisket and Pulled Pork with a side of Mac N Cheese. Their BBQ sauces are amazing, a nice crust of the brisket with a delicate smoke taste. The pulled pork is sweet and savory with a smoke back. I paired the pulled pork with the vinegar and it complimented it nicely. Brisket was paired with the Texas BBQ sauce.   Spork Pit is very casual and accepts cards.   Spork Is higher end food with a business causal vibe. Great drinks, friendly staff and amazing food."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing.  The lentil meatballs are unbelievable.  I also had ricotta gnocchi which may have been the most delicious gnocchi I have ever had.  The atmosphere is really nice.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  My only complaint is that the prices are a bit steep for some of the items.  Everyone needs to try this place.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous!!  And the food, while the portions make you chuckle, is amazing!  I started with the tortellini soup which was very small but came in this ridiculous plate bowl.  It was so delicious though!!  For a main I got the chestnut gnocchi which had kale and pancetta.   Sooooo good!!!  I THOUGHT I would still be hungry so I ordered the lentil balls and they were good, but a little dry.  Good flavor though.  For dessert I had the tres leches.  Oh. My. God. The tres leches!!!  If I had to pick a last meal, yeah, that would be it.  Tl;Dr: expensive, but sooooo good!!!!"}
{"text":"Spork is great and I love the small plates. There is something there for everyone with twist.I will be back again."}
{"text":"I love the name of this place, so I was excited to try out their food. But, I was sorely disappointed. I had the jerk tuna, which was terrible. The tuna was clearly not as fresh as it needed to be for the chosen preparation. And, it was bland. How do you make a \"jerk\" dish bland? I also could not find the mango promised with the dish for the life of me. My companion had chicken patties, which the staff raved about. It ended up being greasy.   During our meal, the owner/chef let us know that he is opening up a new place down the road. Please don't. Pittsburgh needs good food, not the same disappointing mediocrity."}
{"text":"This is one of the best food in Pittsburgh.  Every dish in their tapas menu is amazing.  I only wished I found this place earlier.  Will definitely come back whenever we are in town.  Really nice decor. Great staff.  Best experience.  Everyone in our party was raving how good the food is here.  Keep up the good work.  Pittsburgh is starting to be an amazing place to visit or live."}
{"text":"Come for the food, but the service makes you glad to leave. Unfortunately our dinner conversation was dominated by the service rather than the food. Empty water glasses, forgotten drinks, repeating food orders, table crowded with empty plates, couldn't find the waiter and had to ask someone else for extra spoons, etc..  But the food was good."}
{"text":"I love this place! The ambience, service and food are the best. The food is unique and I enjoy the small plates you can share -- while having a bunch of different options. Spork is one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Spork is my absolute favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. The food, service, drinks and atmosphere make for a perfect casual evening out. I've visited spork at least ten times and it has always been extremely consistent. I highly recommend the tagliatelle with veil, it's dream worthy."}
{"text":"I came here with some Great Expectations since I heard great things. They use the NOwait app so I definitely suggest using it. They have no waiting room, so you could be left standing for a long time while waiting for a table. It seems fine now, but if it were snowing I wouldn't wait for a table at all.   The bar is very welcoming. The drink menu is decent with more beers than cocktails. See pictures in pics of the menu for more details. The table settings are intimate. I was there for date night so it was much appreciated. The table has 2 small candle votives to create a nice intimate vibe. The noise however makes the scene less intimate. It's kind of Loud so you have to speak with intention so the other person can hear you. If you like tapas this is the place for you.  We ordered the following:  Number 11 - drink. Gin, rosemary and ginger. Volume of liquid not worth the price at all. The glass appeared 3/5 full. I had to inquire whether they skimped out on a shot worth of something. The bartender claimed that's how they were supposed to look. Kind of disappointed, but the taste was good. For $12 I want my glass to be close to full. Requested a straw but the server forgot, so I made my husband get me one from the bar. They appeared to be heavier handed with the wine, so maybe I would have been better ordering off the wine list.  Mussels in tomato sauce with chorizo - the taste was good and the spice kind of sneaks up on you. I'd order it again but with a side of bread. They give you this little bitty piece of toast. I'd recommend asking for a couple of pieces of toast or letting them know they should automatically incorporate that in their meal.  Lamb sausage with Brie - the sausage with the Brie was interesting. They cut a piece of sausage on half so it's great for one or 2 ppl  Tagliatelle with bolognese - aka fancy hamburger helper. Enough said.   Coffee steak and egg - the coffee rub is DEFINITELY an acquired taste. I had never had it before and didn't know what would taste like. It left a charred taste in my mouth but it was served medium rare. The charred taste made it seem like it was well done. It also comes with a tagliatelle pasta and an egg served poached. My husband Disliked the pasta but I didn't mind it.   We passed on the dessert, but I did have a dogfish head 90 minute IPA for a relatively reasonable $7. Best dessert choice ever since I knew what to expect. I think Spork is a tad bit overhyped personally. I've had better tapas."}
{"text":"Great food. Beautiful restaurant. I love sitting at the kitchen bar and watching the cooks preparing food. It'a clear this place takes their food very seriously and you will not be disappointed. The meat and cheese board will change your life.   HOWEVER, I have an issue with the bartender:  Both times I ate here I tried to order a drink that wasn't on the menu. Both times I did this, it was a major issue. The first time, I can't remember the details but the waiter made me feel so uncomfortable ordering off the menu that he convinced me to change my mind. The second time (same bartender too), I had my heart set on a classic Aperol Spritz. The waiter had no idea what this was and when I explained it, the bartender argued that the recipe didn't have Prosecco in it. When I pushed the issue, he gave me a splash of prosecco \"as a favor\". THE RECIPE IS ON THE FUCKING BOTTLE!!!! (and it's more than just a splash, thanks).   This restaurant is too expensive and upscale to have a bartender this limited. Major points lost here. I am not saying he needs to know every drink but at least know the classics. Also, they have an app for that! And when you really don't know what the fuck your doing, try looking on the side of the bottle."}
{"text":"This is the third time I have been there and the food was ok but not as good as in the past. They were out of many dishes.  Most disappointing was the service. Our waiter was inattentive and pretentious.  When we ordered the sweetbreads he commented that he was a vegan and that he wouldn't order the dish-like who cares?  I will return and hopefully they will have dissed this guy."}
{"text":"Came here for our anniversary. Started with a fine cocktail, well designed gin with fresh dehydrated ginger called a Muddle- a great open. First it should be noted that a very drunk panhandler entered the restaurant and led the house in a chant of Let's Go Pens! before being showed to the door. It made me well aware of the economic divide that is part of the Penn Avenue neighborhood transition. We waited for 20 minutes at the bar where people graciously made room for us and we were perfectly seated in a great window table for dinner- I was already in a good place having discovered a great drink and was eager for an amazing meal. Ordering at Spork is participatory by checking a paper menu with a pencil- it was a fun way to order. For the record, sporks are on the table with forks, knifes and spoons. We put ourselves in the hands of the waitstaff and ordered what they recommended with the exception of two of our calls: Ceviche and an order of lentil meatballs. We loved the recommended goat cheese in a jar and the grilled romaine salad to start. Our first OK dish arrived in the form of the lentil meatballs. They were dry, luke warm, fried and edible but not great. Next we had the recommended Chestnut Gnocchi-these were better than the meatballs but not worth the big fuss that the staff made. Unfortunately,  although we had not been served all we ordered, we were approach about desserts and only when we inquired about our missing dish did it arrive.The final dish of our meal was a coffee crusted steak which was also highly recommended by the wait staff. This dish was a bright spot of our dinner and ended everything on a super high note. Although the staff was nice- I did not feel like they cared about making our evening special- they did write on the check Happy Anniversary but nothing more - a simple something would have been appropriate - the real slight came as the chef who was working the tables didn't even check in on our table. Over all the cocktail was a plus, the food is very good and the ambiance is nice. The food was creatively prepared and carefully presented right down to the the edible chive blossom - I am looking forward to coming back and trying other dishes- I have a strange positive feeling that our next meal will be better than our first. My expectations were just too high, the service was not dead on for our special night and we picked a couple of near misses to offset three spectacular home runs."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant ten stars I would. The food is creative and delicious. My husband and I shared the goat cheese and eggplant starter and also the crab souffle. Both outstanding - I'd go back for more of that souffle again today! My main course was the pork bolognese tagliattore. Light and flavorful and al dente. Dessert was the royal wedding cake and it also was excellent. I had wanted a Kir Royale as my adult beverage but they did not have Chambord. The bartender came up with a delicious alternative. We ate early which was a good idea because it's a bit noisy. This is definitely one of my go-to Pittsburgh restaurants!!"}
{"text":"This has been one of our staples, but the last two times we have been disappointed. Food is coming out not hot and last weekend we were served a bad scallop. Our server took it off of our tab, but how it was ever served smelling like that, I'll never know. They do some things very well but they are still missing the mark in execution. There are too many excellent restaurants at this price point to make mistakes.  I hope things turn around soon so that we can come back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times since I reviewed and it's really become one of my faves.  The flavors are always so thoughtfully put together and the chef seems like a really great person and always so humble and appreciative of compliments about the menu.  There are items featured on the menu that in any other setting I would claim to dislike, however, this is a chef I trust.  I've tried so many different tastes and flavors and I haven't disliked any.  I have some I prefer and some I won't go back to but none that I've hated.  I always find the flavors to be unpredictable and I guess I think of these guys as artistic with food.  Service is always attentive and friendly.  You don't get the vibe that they feel like you should be grateful for their service like some of the other hot spots around town.  They just want to make sure you enjoy your time with them.  I love it."}
{"text":"Great food. Perfect for date night. We got the pork cheeks, scallops and the veal bolognese. Both were 5/5. We had a hard time finding a reservation for dinner anywhere at 7pm Saturday, but were able to reserve counter seating at Spork. I was afraid we were going to be cramped at a bar, but it was actually a counter right in front of the kitchen. It ended up being really cool entertainment watching the chefs put everything together. Plus it didn't seem cramped even when we were sharing a couple dishes. Normally I don't give 5 star ratings, but the fact that they're on Penn Ave and have a private lot is worth the extra star."}
{"text":"Still so amazing! I took my folks, who were in from out of town for the holidays, last week. Everyone had a great meal. From the chaurcuterie board to the cookie table, every morsel was delicious. Our waiter was incredible, too. Glad to have this become one of our staple spots."}
{"text":"I visited Spork last night with a party of 4 of my friends. We enjoyed ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING! The experience was amazing, and I especially loved how the tapas plates are actually played as small portions of full meals, with lots of flavor and expertly executed preparation.   The menu changes daily, but we had white bean spread, green bean salad, mussels, and the duck. We also got a special send out from the kitchen of polenta cakes that were AMAZING.   Overall, the ambiance is amazing and it's a super cozy restaurant. I didn't order a drink, but the cocktail menu and beer/wine list looked like it has great options! The pricing is amazing for the quality and value you receive at Spork. Oh... and be sure to actually use your Spork to eat your meal!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite new American style restaurant in Pittsburgh. We went to Spork last night for a belated birthday meal and it blew my mind. This was the best restaurant experience I've had in a long time! I don't know if the waiter, Peter, was just spectacular, or if it's standard service across Spork but when I told him I had a dairy allergy, he checked with the chef to see what dishes I could have. The chef ended up made a special pasta for me to make sure there was no cross contamination and then at the end of the meal, he made sure I liked it.   We ordered the small charcuterie, a crostini, my pasta dish, and a hanger steak. The portions were really big and the food was so good. I'm salivating thinking about it!! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I honestly can't wait to go back to this place.  Met a couple girlfriends here for happy hour.  We sat at the bar, had a few drinks and ordered some apps.  The grilled wings were delicious - full of flavor, and definitely hit the spot.  My friend got the pizza - handmade dough, topped with deliciousness.  I regret not trying a slice!    I've since been following the business on Instragram.. which has been a continuous mouth water.  Drinks, foods..  they have a garden next to the place and smoker, which of course they use everything in their food.  Amazing.  I will for sure be back - and have not stopped recommending to anyone that will listen :)"}
{"text":"I don't dish out 5 star reviews often but I give Spork a 5 across the board for multiple reasons. Let's just start with the ambiance...the setup of this restaurant is adorable. It's a very small place with mostly 2 person tables, a few tables for larger parties in the center, a bar to your left, and a bar overlooking the kitchen. We were told when we entered they only had seating at the kitchen and the bar left. We chose the kitchen and I honestly think it may have been one of the best seats in the house. We were able to watch them cook right in front of us which was very cool.   Another big thing I was impressed with was all of the staff. You could see how focused and organized the kitchen staff was at all time. Turning over beautifully prepared plates very quickly. They checked in with us a few times to ask how our dishes were. The waitress was very helpful to explain anything and offer suggestions. Which is always nice when you don't always know how many plates to order at each tapas style restaurant. Upon leaving the restaurant the staff behind the bar was very friendly and wished us a good night which you don't see often. It's the little things that go a long way!  Saving the best part for last, the food. My friend and I ordered a total of 6 plates for our meal. We started with the breads and spreads and the arancini to share. The bread came out very warm and was served with a orange butter, sea salt butter, olive oil, and white bean spread. Pretty hard to mess up bread but I think the spreads were very interesting and unique. The only complaint about the arancini is that it's very small and hard to share just 1 little ball. Main courses we got the following: pasta rag, scallops, mussels, and chestnut gnocchi. I was very impressed with my scallops which were paired with butternut squash Raviolis in a pesto sauce. The scallops were seasoned absolutely perfectly! The gnocchi was also delightful. It was my first time having gnocchi so I don't have anything to compare it to unfortunately.   Overall I think Spork perfected everything. I really hope they keep up the good work and continue to do well. If you haven't been there yet, get there ASAP!"}
{"text":"I just checked out this place for the first time and really liked it.  The atmosphere was nice with the huge windows letting lots of light in.  My friends and I sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks and small plates.  I had the \"Daisy\" cocktail and the linguine that was a take on a carbonara. My friend had the lamb meatballs. I found the cocktails to be excellent with some unique options, though they were a bit pricey for Pittsburgh ($12-14).  Most of their menu items are like tapas/small plates style, with some portions more generous than others. We found all the food to be excellent, though maybe a little overpriced.  The service was pretty good, though sometimes the bartenders were oddly distracted by their strange obsession with polishing the glassware to perfection (see photo).  Often 2 or 3 of them would be polishing glassware at the same time behind the bar with a towel and examining it every few seconds carefully for spots.  This could go on for 10 minutes for one glass, and sometimes their obsession would result in guests not being attended to promptly as their eyes were fixed on the glass.  I appreciate that they hand wash/dry all their glassware and it did look quite spotless and nice up on the bar, but it seemed a bit strange/obsessive and that maybe it could be done at another time than on prime time on a Friday night when it is very busy and they still had plenty of clean glassware remaining."}
{"text":"So glad to see the opening of spork on penn ave. I believe they will do very well. The food was fantastic! It seems that everything is made the \"hard\" albeit delicious way! Well thought-out small plates, some I would more consider medium plates as the portions were great for the price at a nice restaurant. My husband and I ordered 6 to share (including the meat plate which was amazing) and it was plenty of food. Maybe a dish too many for us. The hamburger was the winner for the night. I'd personally give it the best burger in Pittsburgh award. Cooked to exactly the right medium rare as it should be. The flavor of the beef was outstanding. Perhaps slightly soggy on the bun, I'm just going to assume it's because the meat was so juicy and delicious. The goat cheese spread with eggplant was tasty. Jerk chicken wings had a great flavor and texture. The duck confit pasta was very good. And We ended with the tres leche cake which was perfect and covered in delicious fruit. Going to be back sometime for the cookie table!  All in all, I can't wait to go back. Great spot!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town for the weekend and we found this place and are so happy we went there! The atmosphere was great, the dim lighting and candles on the table made it feel cozy. We had no wait and sat right down. We got the steak fries as a starter which were very tasty. My husband and I got the Salmon and Tuna dishes which were phenomenal!! The chef even came over to our table and asked how our meal was. The wait staff was very friendly as well. We definitely recommend this place to anyone unsure :)"}
{"text":"Went on the recommendation of a coworker. Fantastic food, I am a vegetarian and found there were plenty of meatless options that were clearly labeled on the menu. The atmosphere and service were also great. Will definitely visit again!!"}
{"text":"Well, I've officially been coming here for a year, and Spork has become our neighborhood go-to. Service quality still varies a bit by who you get (on our most recent visit, we didn't get one of our ordered items, and then needed to ask our server for more silverware as it was cleared before our final dish was brought out), but I still wholeheartedly recommend this place, and have brought many out-of-town guests.  For those not used to tapas-style dining, the prices may seem a little high relative to portion size, but Spork is great for those of us who love variety and just want to try a little bit of everything. It's especially fantastic to be able to enjoy a small order of pasta and not be stuffed to the gills!  I grew up with homemade pasta, and Spork does it justice, with an innovative variety of filled and sauced treats. I especially love the experiments with chestnut flour, which are unfortunately a seasonal offering. Spork is opening up a pit BBQ place and you can get a taste of the future with the brisket sandwich and brisket ravioli. We opted for the ravioli on our most recent visit, and the meat was incredibly tender and flavorful. The pizzas are a recent addition, and are certainly tasty, but we are spoiled for brick-oven pizza in PGH, so save room for the tapas and pasta instead. I've not been particularly impressed with the dessert offerings; hopefully when they open the new place, they'll hire a baker.  Beyond the consistently delicious--despite a large menu of offerings--food, Spork offers a great cocktail program and wine list. On Mondays from 6-10, you can enjoy half off a bottle of already-reasonably-priced wine...but you had better save me a seat!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  Small plates. Perfect wine. We couldn't get a table reservation so we sat at the bar.  Wes was the bartender and our server. He was great. We enjoyed the bread & spreads, corvina,  ceviche, veal- pork - beef meatballs and the sweet breads.  Perfect!"}
{"text":"Cocktails were hands-down the best I've had at a restaurant. My husband and I came with high expectations from the great reviews, and we were not disappointed. I'm still thinking about the \"straw and hay\" pasta and the scallops. Highly recommend. Service was wonderful, too!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing fresh great food combinations a variety for people with lots of different tastes.  I love small plates great for sharing a few bit and you are able try other things without getting weighed down with a full meal. Allows you to try a variety of different foods.  Everything I had was yummy.  We had the charred romaine, hummus, scallops, ceviche and pizza.  Very chill atmosphere nice and cozy.  So glad I decided to try it"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this new addition to Garfield, but my sub-par to average experience here doesn't have me dying to come back anytime soon.   We waited nearly 30 minutes for anyone to come over and take our order. When our server finally came over, they asked us if we were ready to order, despite no explanation of their menu (didn't know how many plates to order, wasn't exactly sure if we were supposed to fill in the bubbles on their menu). Even once our drink order was placed, we still waited nearly 15 minutes to get them (had to make eye contact with the waitress to remind her we were still waiting). The drinks were nothing special, but thankfully the food was great and we ordered just enough plates to leave feeling satisfied.   Unfortunately, food alone doesn't quite do it for me. I want to enjoy my time while dining out (at least I do at a place like this) and I felt like the lack of service, plus drinks that left a lot to be desired, was enough to put this on my \"meh, nothing special\" list."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service - we used the NoWait app and it said 15-30 min.  We arrived about 20 min after reserving our place in line.  The hostess and managers couldn't give us any idea of when we would be seated.  After waiting 15 min a 4 top opened up and I thought we were up but no luck.  The 4 top sat open for 20 min and all of sudden a group walks in and immediately is seated.  Ridiculous.  We left and WILL NEVER BE BACK."}
{"text":"So far all we've done is wait. Seems like the No Wait App is disregarded when it comes to who should me seated first. This is a current time review. No Wait says zero ahead of us. Only hope the food is worth the looooonnggg wait."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night. I had some of the best lobster I've ever had. It was flavorful and juicy. My colleague had the wagyu skirt steak.   They had some great IPAs on their drink list.   So here's what I didn't like. The music was stupid loud. I had to shout to my colleagues who were seated next to me in order for them to hear me.   Also, they seated us at the bar (there were three of us) and so I had to turn sideways to talk to them."}
{"text":"Really good food! I went with a bunch of friends and we shared a ton of things. I loved everything! From what I can remember, we had the bread and spread, cured meats, goat cheese jar, lamb meatballs, scallops with butternut squash ravioli , duck, and so much more. For dessert I had an almond lace cookie with cinnamon ice cream and they topped it off with espresso. The menu changes day by day, so there is always something new to try. I would defiantly go back to Spork!"}
{"text":"We went a little early on a Friday and were able to get a table or sit at the bar.  Service was great.  We were able to get a description of a few items we were interested in, Our food came out at a good pace and we were asked if we wanted additional drinks and how we liked the food.  One gentleman stopped by to make sure we were happy with our meal.  I started with a Jar of goat cheese, balsamic-eggplant, toast - very tasty and good especially the goat cheese, thought the eggplant was there but did not add anything to the jar. Then I had the duck breast & confit, foie gras, tortellini, roots.  This was a huge success.  A tasty and nice balance of flavors.  All in a a good place to relax and have a good meal."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this tapas place while visiting college for my kid.  Had a great meal - 2 pasta dishes, risotto cake, and breads with spreads.  Don't pass on desserts - olive oil cake was rich.  Chef walked around and spoke to guests - we had a great discussion about the area. Pictures are below."}
{"text":"Solid food, good service and welcoming ambiance. For starters, we tried several dishes. The pear, quinoa, and spinach salad were all exceptional. The ingredients play with each other to form unique tastes at nearly every bite. I especially enjoyed the halloumi on top of the quinoa salad. A great combination of texture and saltiness that I will surely attempt to replicate at home. We also tried the goat cheese jar. Simply a must if you are a cheese lover. The bread that comes with this dish is smothered and toasted in olive oil for a beautiful marriage with the balsamic eggplant that sits on top of the goat cheese. We also had the lamb meatballs and the scallops. I personally did not enjoy the meatballs however I can still attest that this was due to personal taste preferences and not to the quality of the dish. The scallops were impressive and paired surprisingly well with the butternut ravioli. Last but not least, we finished with the bistro filet and opted for the wagyu strip substitute. The dish is the most expensive on the menu however it is well worth the try. On a personal note, I would like to add that executive chef Christian was going table to table asking patrons how their dinning experience was going. Not only did we thus get the chance to meet him but I also got the chance to meet sous chef Rocco which was truly delightful. Rocco and Christian showed me the cut of wagyu beef that was used for the dish we tried. We even had the chance to discuss about the food scene in Pittsburgh. Overall, a truly satisfying dinning experience."}
{"text":"Great bar, great food, great service. This is a good replacement for Salt."}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice - although a bit dark - and, as a side note, the background music was awful. I feel like Spork is trying a little too hard to be cool but I'll forgive them for the cocktails and food. I'm also a huge fan of the fact that Spork is 'No Wait' app-friendly - we walked right in, were greeted by name, and seated immediately.  We started with cocktails. I had the herbal (vodka, watercress, mint, st germain), which was one of the best drinks I've ever had anywhere; and, my husband had the daisy (honeydew, mezcal, smoked chiles), which he said was very different from what his normal choice of an IPA but appropriate for the feast we had.  We started with the charcuterie board, which rivaled my favorite in town (at the Allegheny Wine Mixer).   We followed with some gnosh: --Goat cheese, balsamic-eggplant, biscotti - Warm, lovely, and served on the most perfectly grilled bread (if I could have bought a jar to take home, I would have). -Arugula, pancetta, soft egg, tomato - I wanted to love this salad but just didn't. The arugula was missing with spinach in its place and the pancetta was hard to find.  We then had a few items from the vario section: --Grilled lamb sausage, brie, mustard, flatbread - The ingredients each on their own were very yummy but the dish fell flat on composition (it was quite messy, almost thrown together). --Pork cheeks, cider jus, tempura apple, polenta - By far, my favorite dish of the night due to the meaty, tart, creamy little bit of everything quality of the flavors.  We finished with some pasta:  --Pasta rags, mint, ricotta, peas, duck soppressata - I could have eaten this twice over for sure, as the pasta was delicate, the mint/ricotta/peas combo a palette pleaser, and the duck soppressata perfectly cooked.  We obviously had a huge meal but I don't feel like it was overly expensive for the quality and quantity of what we ordered. The only downside to this specific experience was that we had awful, excruciatingly slow service, which can ruin even the best tapas meal. Again, I'll forgive the service for the food.   I think Spork is still having growing pains, as they are relatively new to the Pittsburgh food scene - so I'd like to go back again and see if I'm still willing to forgive the shortcomings. I'd also like to sit at the bar so I can watch the kitchen."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Spork the other night and it was wonderful!  It's a small plates place and we tried the goat cheese and white bean spread, the vegetarian gnocchi, the scallops and lentil meatballs. Everything was fabulous!  The service was friendly, I loved the ambiance and I will definitely go back !"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great addition to Penn Ave. The tapas menu is big and everything sounded delicious. My boyfriend and I decided on a grilled romaine salad, chestnut gnocchi, scallops & ravioli, and lamb meatballs. My favorite was the chestnut gnocchi, but everything was fantastic. Our table decided on the \"breads and spreads\" as a starter, with homemade warm baguette. The service was fantastic, and the chef/owner came by twice to say hello! For dessert, our table shared a cookie table, which was served with milk in shot glasses and was really fun to share."}
{"text":"Spork: I have walked by you several times and your rustic warm decor has tempted me to come in. I was smitten with your use of fresh ingredients, and had heard good things. Unfortunately, my expectations were too high, and the food and service left much to be desired. I would be very hesitant to come back here...   Overview: Hard to beat the look and feel of this place, good for a romantic dinner or small group dinners A little loud, but more because people are having a good time.  This was our first time here, so I was new to the three menus they provided and the different options. The server could make a better effort to explain the menus, but maybe she was rushed. We ordered a mesclun salad and lamb meat balls to start, which came out quickly, a little too quickly. The salad was good, not great, but some of the lettuce was a wilted. The lamb meat balls looked like they were under a heat lamp for several hours and were barely warm. We told the server that they weren't warm and she offered to warm them up. We eventually indicated that we'd prefer fresh meatballs and after an awkward exchange, she understood. I was surprised that a server asked if we wanted to have our food reheated, because..... that's what Subway asks you to do, not nice restaurants do.. After the meatballs came out, they were fine, not particularly tasty. There's an awesome place downtown for meatballs, so don't order them here.  We also ordered the Haddock, which was tasty. The Lamb sausage flat bread was also good. Overall, the food was fine, but I felt the flavor profile was a little off for my preferences. Maybe it was the Monday blues, but I wasn't in love with any of the dishes I tried. I left not feeling full, mostly because I didn't want to be disappointed by trying additional dishes.   For a place that had such high reviews, I came in with high expectations. If I had lower expectations, I wouldn't have been disappointed, I also wouldn't have expected to pay an above average price for a few small mediocre dishes."}
{"text":"My husband and I checked out Spork for an early dinner last week. We had been fans of the Quiet Storm when it was in the same location and were quite impressed with the redesign!  The hostess and servers were all super-friendly, and our drinks and food were delivered promptly. The waitress was also very knowledgeable about the menu and made sure we understood the tapas-sized portions.   We shared two meatball dishes, lamb with a cucumber yogurt sauce, and a more traditional veal/pork/beef meatball in a red sauce. Both variations delivered in flavor, while the lamb was the spicier of the two and the veal/pork/beef was more rich in flavor. Both held up on their own without sauce, which I think is key when it comes to meat!  We also shared the ceviche, which was fine, but my skirt wasn't blown up. I think my husband said it best, \"I've had better ceviche at a lesser price.\" There you go!  Lastly we had the chestnut gnocchi, which DID blow up my skirt. The sauce had this welcoming smokiness to it that complimented the prosciutto component of the dish, and the pasta was cooked perfectly. However, this dish would have been a bit too heavy on a warmer day. But, fall/winter I could eat a portion and a half.   We weren't all that impressed with the cocktail menu. I ended up with a simple vodka/tonic and it tastes like they make their own tonic, which is a nice touch.  And even though the waitress was upfront about the portions of each dish I expected more than 3 meatballs per order, at least an even number.   Overall, we would definitely go back, their brunch sounds interesting. My only real \"negative\" note is that the food/plating/potion seems a bit too precious, i.e. too light/delicate of a hand. Full disclosure that's my meat and potato background rearing it's head."}
{"text":"Cute place with welcoming staff. Faith at the bar was super awesome. Gave this place a 4 because the non pork options felt limited. I ordered the Monday Lasagna special which included a delicious salad filled with yummy texture and taste. The lasagne portion was much smaller than I anticipated but delicious. Special included a glass of cheap red wine that I gave to my coworker. I'd def give them another try just for the dessert selection. The cookie table is calling my name."}
{"text":"I finally tried Spork this last week for the first time and had an amazing food experience. The atmosphere is really nice inside - a little chic industrial, but not obnoxiously so. It kind of reminds me of a more spacious and private-seated Salt (may it rest in peace).  This sort of place is inevitably going to get negative reviews from people who have expectations that a single plate that costs $11 is going to be enough to stuff them like a foie gras goose for the meal and have leftovers to spare. If you want this - please go to Mad Mex. This isn't that kind of restaurant. This is small, intentional carefully plated gourmet plates with interesting and unique ingredients, cooked to perfection.  For both the dinner and Sunday brunch I went to, we averaged about 2 plates per person and walked out feeling full. Some plates are quite small (waffle) while others are huge (coffee steak). The waitstaff was very helpful in properly setting expectations.  Both brunch and dinner had a pretty large set of vegetarian and gluten-free menu items. I didn't ask about how careful they are about gluten separation, but it is good that at least the menu is labeled and they're thinking about it!   Cocktails were quite pleasant, though all slanted a bit on the sweet side and perhaps a bit stingy in quantity. My brunch pomplamoose cocktail seemed to disappear a bit too quickly (though i did just spend over 2 hours in Home Depot prior - probably needed it!)  It would be good to see a few more bitter/complex cocktails on the menu to balance it out. I've yet to try going off-menu to see how creative they can get, but am excited to return and see!"}
{"text":"I do not give out 5 stars lightly--3 is 'a-ok' for me.  This really is one of the best experiences in Pittsburgh I've had in some time.  Found Spork as an accident.  It's located in the old 'Quiet Storm' space but has been completely renovated--interior is elegant and has a NY feel to it.    The chef, Christian Frangiadis, and backed by David Tepper (just read that on-line when I was looking up info) just returned from Pittsburgh after spending several years working out of town.  Service was excellent--off the charts when you consider this place has only been open two days (typically lots of kinks to work out).  Small plates with an Italian influence.  Everything from the pastas to the the curing of the meats are done in house.  Had the cookie plate for dessert--everything was fantastic.    Pittsburgh really is becoming a food hub.  We're so lucky to be here now!"}
{"text":"I love love love the light fixtures in this place! Seriously, Spork has a great ambiance for a date night. It's cozy, but not too dark, and you still have enough room to fill your table with delicious small plates to share. Our server was very friendly and offered some great recommendations. We ordered family style, getting two things per person, which was a bit too much for our six girl group - I would get 1.5 things per person if I came back with the same group of girls who don't eat a lot.   The bread was deliciously chewy in both the bread and spreads, as well as the smoked trout toasts, which was like a whitefish salad. The pork cheeks with delicious crunchy polenta were fabulous, as were the lamb meatballs, and scallops.   Unfortunately, they were out of the octopus pasta, but we tried the smoked brisket ravioli which I thought was a little too plain. We also tried the straw and something pasta with peas - that was delicious. The smoked salmon pasta came out a little on the underdone side but we were too full to really complain at that point. The flavors were very good nonetheless and it probably would have been my favorite if the pasta were a little less raw on the inside. The only thing that I wouldn't get again were the fries. They were large cut wedges with aioli and sriracha mayo dipping sauces, but they were a little boring compared to the rest of the food. Overall, we had a fabulous dinner and service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Spork made my birthday! Amazing tapas menu, plenty of vegetarian options, and everything tasted fantastic! The decor is classy and elegant with a rustic touch. Perfect for a special night out!   We ordered the bread and spreads which comes with 3 spreads and olive oil. The bread was phenomenal - crunchy yet fluffy. Yum! Next, I had the goat cheese and eggplant jar with toast which was SO good! The goat cheese and eggplant spread was creamy and surprisingly sweet. Definitely my favorite! The falafel was also very tasty! It came in three deep fried balls and served with a sweet purée.   Unfortunately, I could not let myself eat an entire cookie table on my own, so I opted for the tres leche cake which was phenomenal! It came with strawberries, blueberries, and caramelized banana. Ah-ma-zing!!   The service provided at Spork was top notch. Everyone from the hostess to our waitress were so friendly and helpful. The chef even came out to greet every table.   Parking is super convenient. There is a gravel lot right across from the restaurant with free parking.   I can't recommend Spork enough! I did not have a single complaint the entire night. Food, service, and atmosphere were fantastic! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The plates were delicious. They have a lot to choose from and more than most in terms of vegan and gluten free options. The scallops were disappointing thankfully the ravioli on the plate saved what could have been true disaster. The other dishes were lovely, to list a few of my favs; romain, duck, bread with spreads, the ravioli, and the lamb. All were wonderful. The environment was warm and welcoming with a bit of rustic antique glam. The only reason for my four stars is that the configuration of the menu was almost unreadable. I have never been so confused by the setup of a menu in my life. Nor do I want to pay top dollar for food I check off of a list using a pencil. It made me feel as if I was at burgatory, looking forward to watching this place blossom into a beautiful staple in Bloomfield. I truly believe it is here to stay! cheers to that!"}
{"text":"The quick review is - pleasantly surprised, but bring a stack o' cash or leave your appetite at home. And now for the how. The ambiance you're presented with is a sleek mix of low lighting, tables, bar seats, bar height tables, and an exposed kitchen. Read and re-read the tap list, but it was tough to find a beer that grabbed our attention that evening (there is a worthy wine list though). Reading the food menu is of equal experience - nothing that really stood out other than elevated ingredient pairings with price points to match. The 'bites' take the word bite quite literally and an array of them would be necessary to feel $atiated. So the haters and the doubters are in full effect...then, pleasantly surprised once you take that first bite! The scallop + butternut ravioli plate layered complimentary flavors including prosciutto and pesto. The mussels with its spicy tomato based broth and chorizo bits were also a hit as were the arancini, which were unexpectedly excellent.  Further, the meatballs were good not great.  It's obvious that the dishes are prepared with precision, and their presentation is to be lauded.  A future visit will have to include a fresh pasta and/or a more adventurous 'composed' plate off their ephemeral menu...oh and a proper cocktail!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food here was very good on the whole.  The atmosphere was very nice, and the inside was well decorated.  The menu had a nice offering of both food and drinks.  I had read several reviews, and there were many complaints regarding the seating time, and some complaints about the portion sizes.  Unlike these reviews, I thought that for a tapas restaurant, the portions of most of the dishes were appropriate.  I also didn't have a problem getting seated.  So why only 2 stars from me?  Simply put, the service.  When I say the service was the problem, I don't mean the hostess who greeted us with a smile and promptly seated us.  I also am not referring to the gentleman (who I believe was either the owner or head chef) who came by later in the meal to make sure that everything was ok.  That is always a nice touch.  I am solely describing the service by our waiter, which was nothing short of atrocious.    We started off the meal with drinks.  From the very beginning, our waiter had an air of pompousness, and my date later referred to his personality as \"snarky\". I don't think that he even once smiled. I asked him about their featured drink - which was an aperitif.  He said that he didn't recommend that type of drink, because if it were him that were drinking that, then he would have to decide all of the dishes that he ordered based on that drink.  He proceeds to tell me that when people order a combination of food and drinks that he doesn't agree with, he just turns away and says, \"OK, very good.\"   Ok...so, he is a food snob.   I order the aperitif anyway, because it sounded interesting.    We ordered about 5 tapas dishes, after which he sort of blankly stares and then bluntly (and seeming disapprovingly) utters, \"thats a lot of food\", and walks away.  I thought this a strange remark from a waiter at a small plate/tapas restaurant, and very odd since most waiters would happily take an order for more food since this would generally mean a larger tip.  Our first dish comes out - it is simply bread, but with several dipping sauces.  One is an oil, which I believed to be olive oil, but it had a fruity/banana like taste, as well as a slightly grassy flavor.  When the waiter came back around, I asked him what this oil was.  He stares at me like I'm an uneducated idiot, and blurts out \"olive oil.\"  I told him of the fruity flavor, and asked him if it was infused with anything.  He coldly replies, \"No.  Maybe its your drink.\" Then he shrugs his shoulders and says, \"I told you so.\"  ??  Wow.  Later, I researched this and found that some high quality olive oils have these flavors.  But obviously our food snob waiter didn't know that, and instead decided to hand me a disdainful response. After eating virtually all of the dishes we originally ordered, I ordered one more dish.  He paused for a few seconds, eyes shifting to the side with a clearly disapproving look on his face before turning away and muttering, \"OK, very good\".  I suppose that he had a problem with me ordering more food, or that he thought that dish didn't complement my drink?  At virtually every opportunity, this man felt the need and the privilege to display his arrogance and deliver contemptuous remarks.  My real regret now is that I should have tipped him low, to reflect the type of service that I received.  I have had bad service many times, but I have never had service that was this offensive to me, and it is certainly not what I would expect from a high end restaurant.  It is very unfortunate, because if it were not for our waiter, I can honestly say that I would surely be back. After this experience though, I would never consider patronizing Spork again. I do wish the owners of this restaurant success though - because other than our waiter, I thought that everything was great."}
{"text":"This is a lovely addition to the Pittsburgh scene. The ambience is very Lower East Side circa 2010, which, at least for me, was a great time/place to get a bite. It's cozy and well designed. Now, we went on a Monday night near closing time so it wasn't particularly crowded, but I remember thinking \"wow, this place has wonderful sound design,\" in that the ceilings were relatively high and the space quite open and yet I could hear my dinner companions without them having to raise their voices. Seems like a silly observation, but many times I have to pop in an ear plug to reduce the surrounding noise at restaurants. Anyway, even though we arrived later the staff was wonderful! Many times you can see the look of horror/anguish/hate in their eyes when you come towards the end of the shift and risk staying slightly after hours (I get it, I've done it), but everyone who helped us was so nice. I ended up going with some sort of gin drink and loved it; my companions went with wine and equally enjoyed their selections. We then ordered a sampling of land and sea. Some things were amazing! and some were fine. Having read yelp reviews before arriving, I noticed a pattern of people recommending the breads and spreads. Trust the hype and do it. They're awesome. The bolognese on the other hand did not blow my socks off. One of my fellow diners was in love with it, but I'm Italian and found it to be no better than the homemade pasta and sauce my gram makes every weekend. The mussels tasted extremely fresh, which is not the norm for the Pittsburgh/seafood pairing, so I very much appreciated it. Overall I was very satisfied and excited to return again. Note: as so many other people have before, I will point out that the portions are quite small and require quite the sampling for you and your party to be completely full. That can get pricey in this case. Plan accordingly and ask your server for his/her recommendations (the staff seems very knowledgable and happy to assist). It's not standard Pittsburgh fair, which makes it a lovely treat, so make sure you are prepared to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I'm all about that cookie tray! The other tapas I tried were good as well. It was a long wait Saturday night, but I generally expect that. Expensive but quality food."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. I sat at the bar. Multiple staff coming to me, confused with who was my server. I tried a variety of small plates. A few were decent, but the majority of the food was disappointing. The concept seems good, but the execution was off. Kitchen staff seemed uninterested and careless-not what customers want to see when the kitchen is on display in the restaurant."}
