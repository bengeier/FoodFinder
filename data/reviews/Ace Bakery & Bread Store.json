{"text":"I work in this area and there isn't much to choose from for lunch, but this place is exceptional! The nicest staff and decent wait times. The cafe club sandwich is my go-to, there is also creative special sandwiches every week. I have also had the soups and salads which are delicious and home made. Avocado toast is pretty good but a tad overpriced for what you get. Overall, very impressed with the setup and it's a great option for a quick relatively healthy fresh lunch!"}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of ACE bakery breads in the grocery store.  They have a cafe?  Hey, I'm in!  The interior is chic and industrial.  Service was laid back and a bit slow considering what we ordered, but it wasn't busy and they had  only opened moments before we got there.  

Needless to say, all their breads are amazing! And there is always a special on a different one of their loaves every week.  They create a new signature sandwiches every week in addition to their primary offerings.  Hello pulled pork!! :L *drool* Unfortunately, I was there in the morning.  And while the Brekkie sandwich satisfied, I would have liked to try a lunch option.  I will be back!!

Hidden dab smack in a commercial zone most would miss this gem. I would recommend stopping by for lunch instead of going to Metro for a soggy sammie.  For about the same price you get a gourmet bun."}

Did you know that the Ace Bakery factory has a small cafe opened up on their Hafis Rd. site? Yup, they do. It's open 6 days a week, your basic 10 a.m. -3 p.m. hours and have cafe seating for about a dozen people. They offer up a decent sandwich menu, along with a daily soup, a daily muffin and a salad option as well. Sandwiches are such comfort food and nothing beats having a sandwich on freshly baked bread, especially bread that has such great texture and flavour. 

Offerings include a bit of a twist on tuna with a Japanese styled tuna dressed with rice wine and wasabi vinaigrette served on a multi-grained panini. Being the beef lover I am I often opt for the roast beef with arugula, tomatoes and horseradish mayo on a ciabatta lunga. They do the apple cheddar play on sandwiches, bocconcini & oven roasted tomatoes and a curried chicken salad with chopped apples served on raisin walnut bread. On a few occasions they had a grilled cheese up on the menu as well.  You can also grab a toasted cranberry focaccia bun and a coffee which is a great mid morning pickup.  Sandwich prices range from $6.00-$7.50.  I have always found the ingredients to be fresh and plentiful. 

You have an option to do a half and half, combining a sandwich and a soup or salad. Soups are changed daily (today's was chilled green pea) and are very hearty, not tasting of flour or too much salt.  The salads are fairly basic (which means mixed mache greens) with options for standard or greek styled salads.  Standard vinaigrette dressing are offered for dressing.  For dessert Ace Bakery Cafe sells a small selection of  Dufflet's squares and tarts. 

While there you can also pick up their breads, both fresh and frozen. I have found a wider range of their bread products than I find in my local food specialty shops at just a slightly lower price. I have always had a love affair with their potato foccacia and their cranberry fococcia is what I use to make the best French toast you'll eat this side of the great lakes.  Any left over Ace baguette in my house get turned into delicious croutons for snacks or salads.  

Ace has expanded its product line to include their own crostini crackers, as well a their house brand granola. They recently introduced their own cookie brand, offering up two kinds of cookies, one cookie with chocolate & pecans and the other an oatmeal, chocolate & walnut cookie, priced at $4.99 @ box. 

It's a bit out of the way but if you are up in the Lawrence & Keele area it's a great place to stop for lunch."}
{"text":"My favourite lunch combo of all time is a soup and sandwich. Unfortunately, I haven't found anywhere in Toronto that does a really good one. Some coworkers recommended Ace Bakery due to its proximity to our office, so I ventured out recently to give it a try. 

The soup of the day didn't sound overly appealing to me that day, so I just ordered a sandwich. I was craving smoked salmon, but when I asked for it without dill, they said it's pre-made and already mixed in. Ok, pass. I chose the Italian grilled cheese instead. 

When I opened the sandwich, I could barely make out any cheese inside. I found the bread to be too thick for the amount of cheese and it was quite dry as a result. I also felt the type of bread was a bit too overpowering for a grilled cheese, but this is just my personal preference and I'm sure many others would disagree. 

It was ok, but I prefer a place that allows you to build your own sandwich. This place is better suited to people who want something quick and are not overly picky about what's in their sandwich."}
{"text":"+ good bread
-  pricey pricey pricey

This cafe is located within the factory building. You would think the breads would be at a discount. Oh no, they are actually priced higher than in local grocery stores. Seems like a pathetic money grab to me. Other than a bread special of the day, everything here costs an arm and a leg. $9 for a small lunch sandwich?  Who's running this place?  The sandwich was good, but not $9 good. There's only a single large table to eat your lunch at too--weird. 

It's not worth the drive to the industrial section of town folks. What a disappointment."}
