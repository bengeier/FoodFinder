{"text":"I have been going here on and off since it opened.  I like the laid back environment.  Friendly but no overly so.  I don't need to be fawned over.  I don't really care for small talk but if i want some its there.  Service is great and  making food from scratch takes time.  So I usually bring my lap top and do some work while I wait.  Owners don't know my name because I am not a regular but they do recognize your face and nod acknowledgement.  It's either seat your self if the restaurant is not crowded or the put you at a table, but wait isn't very long.  I go during the week so I usually don't have a wait.  I avoid weekends because 9-5'ers are there and they need some much more attention.  Too much drama. The food is outstanding and creative.  Coffee is great I wish it was a little hotter, but since that old lady at McDonald's they have to be careful.  I highly recommended this place. I am glad they made it through the rough spots in the  economy  I was afraid it be like a lot restaurants in Ahwatukee here today gone tomorrow."}
{"text":"It is our second and the last time to this place. The crepe is ok, but the service is so bad to the \"new\" customers. 1st, no one come our table to place orders; then even after we ordered our food, there was more waiting.  I had to remind them to not forget our order cuz people come after us already finished their food already!!! We have been waiting 40 minutes with just two water and an ice latte, but the owner just say \"your orders will be ready in minutes\" without any apologies. Never bring your love to this place or it will ruin your weekend morning."}
{"text":"After reading most of the reviews, I thought we were going to have to wait for a long time to get our food. We came here at 1030 on a Monday, the place was 3/4 full and we probably waited at most 10 min to get our food.  It was good. The staff isn't overly friendly, but they aren't as slow as some reviews say. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great service, decent crepes, nice ambiance. We tried the bacon egg and cheese, ham egg and cheese, Nutella, and cinnamon sugar crepes. The savory crepes were dry, and slightly bland, also lacking in creativity. I was wishing for some seasoning, non-lunchmeat ham, and some green chile sauce to bring some flavor. The Nutella crepe was by far the best, although the use of ready whip and Hershey's syrup took away from the Nutella, wish they had made their own products. The cinnamon sugar crepe was by far the worst, having almost no flavor.  If they had used less store product I think they would have a dynamite crepe, it's not hard at all to make whipped cream, and chocolate sauce.  Overall a mixed experience, prefer Crepe Bar for their far superior, and much more creative crepes."}
{"text":"We had a great experience. We will definitely come back again. Best crepes I've had. My wife had the mushroom And avocado crepe. It was so good, my five-year-old took it away from her. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My standard for crepes is from my favorite food truck, Truckin' Good Food.  I like this little joint, but it doesn't quite live up to my standard.  My dining companion, a junior crepe aficionado, ordered the turkey pesto crepe, which is supposed to have avocados and tomatoes, etc. Junior crepe aficionado complained that she hadn't bitten into an avocado yet halfway through her crepe, so she opened the darn thing only to find two measly pieces of avocado.   I had the BLT, which was pretty good, but again, missed the mark on the promised avocado.  Maybe avocados were not in season?  Most of the customers were enjoying items from the sweet crepes selection. My dining companions and I did, too. We shared the Nutella, strawberries and bananas topped with whipped cream...and really, how can you go wrong with that? It was delish.  I dig this place, and I was so glad to see the place packed with locals enjoying sweet and savory crepes, while working on their computers (they have free wi-fi BTW). The owners are friendly and they seem to know most of the people present, indicating that they have regulars. That's a good thing.  But there is a difference between my fave Truckin' Good Food's crepes and Cupz and Crepes'. There is a difference in the quality and richness of the ingredients used by both. You bite into a Truckin's crepe and the robustness of the flavors envelops you, leaving you sometimes speechless. You bite into Cupz and Crepes' offering and you say, \"It's good.\" You feel me?  Would I recommend this joint. Yes, of course. It's a good breakfast place where you might just meet your neighbors. It's cozy, it's friendly...and you know... \"it's good.\""}
{"text":"The crepes are delicious! We come here for breakfast or for lunch. For lunch, we always order a salad in addition to the crepes. We enjoy both the sweet and the savory crepes. This is also a good place to meet friends for coffee. They have a good selection of coffees and teas. The service is great. I'm happy to have this restaurant here in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"The most delicious crepes ever! So much to choose from and very friendly staff. A great place to go & it's  one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Wow. Just had the best ever breakfast at Cupz N Crepes.  Get the BLTA, it was AWESOME!!  I drive 36 miles one way to eat here and my only complaint is,  I wish they were open all day and night!  LOVE THIS PLACE.  5 STARS."}
{"text":"Fabulous food for all. Delicious crepes fresh interesting healthy salads very friendly service. This is my favorite! Great for entertaining guests with very reasonably prices. Don't miss this hidden gem."}
{"text":"I love crepe, both real traditional french style and french-wanna-be-japanese style.   Their desert crepe with nutella reminded me of the times i traveled in europe =D  Their regular lunch menu is more americanize? I think   Their crepe is kind of thicker than I'd normally like, but still good.  Still I am soo happy to have a crepe place in az that actually tastes good.   They have good coffee as well, portion is real European style, pretty big. haha, but good quality .  I love this place for lunch."}
{"text":"I love to come to this delicious crepe place for brunch. Gina is always so sweet and my coffee is never empty. Prices are good and the food very tasty. Paris decor is adorable. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered the Turkey Pesto Crepe and Cappuccino. The crepe's presentation is nice, but the overly greasy and over powering pesto stole rest of the flavors from Avocado and Turkey. Cappuccino was decent, I just wish my hot cappuccino was actually hot and not cooler than lukewarm like it has been sitting there for a while. I will give it another try (and stay away from the Pesto next time) and see if maybe it's an actual hidden gem or it's just over rated mistake."}
{"text":"The crepes are delicious. The service is bad. I'm not sure if the owner is purposefully trying to ruin the business or it's just poor service. This business could be fantastic but it's not. So I've decided their crepes are not worth a 45 minute wait. If you decide to go, I'd walk straight to the cash register and submit your order. That should shave off about 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a crepe place ever since I got here and finally found this place, the only place! Great place to go for dessert crepes. They are a little pricey for my taste, but I thought the crepes were practically perfect.   The crepes were not too thin, not too soggy, and overflowing with nutella, strawberry and bananas. I have not tried the savory crepes yet. The only reason I take one star off is because of the hours of operation, they close by 4, which did not make me too happy."}
{"text":"This is a cozy coffee shop in a strip mall.  I went for lunch one day and ordered a sweet crepe with nutella, strawberries, and bananas.  It was very good.  In addition to the sweet and savory crepes, you can also create your own with a wide range of fillings.  The coffee was also good.  The service was warm and friendly.  This is a good place to relax and enjoy a sandwich alternative.  The TV didn't seem to fit the rest of the restaurant, although I'm sure sports fans will be happy."}
{"text":"The slow and incompetent service is the downfall of this place. Disappointing because it could be such a cute little place if they improved this! It usually takes over an hour for my boyfriend and I to order and get our food here. Little acknowledgement when we come in and a few times we have had to ask for someone to come serve us.  Crepes are pretty good in my opinion, a little on the small side for the price, but then again I haven't tried crepes elsewhere yet so I have no comparison."}
{"text":"The Crepe Bar in Tempe finally has a stiff competitor.  I absolutely am in love with this place, price and the right variety in menu.  Their menu price is anywhere between $3-$7.  Very affordable!  The facility is very small, and you may have to wait a few minutes prior to being seated.  The service is a little slow and takes a bit to warm up to the staff because initially because they did not come off too friendly.  My 3 kids and I ordered 3 dessert crepes. We ordered Nutella w/whip, banana Nutella and a savory cheese, egg and avocado crepe! Delish!!   My son does not like crepes because he is very particular with what he eats however this crepe hit the right spot because he guzzled it down like water.  The portion size is enough to fill you up! The crepes were soft, fresh and just right! The fillings were made with fresh vegetables and fruits without the gooey preserves that normally comes with any fruit crepe.  We would definitely come back! We spent a whopping $17 for 4 orders of crepes and an iced vanilla latte!"}
{"text":"I had the turkey pesto crepe and it was so good but I also had the Elvis crepe and that one wasn't as good but it was still delicious"}
{"text":"Breakfast amazing! We tried the breakfast crepe despite someone posting they were not a good choice. We had the mushroom, avocado & feta. It was good. Of course the nutella was perfect. We finished up with strawberries and cream cheese. Happy to was fresh strawberries and not frozen. We will be back! Service was prompt, friendly and food was quick. We will be back"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Hidden treasure try it! And I am a picky one. Price is right people are great!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend went here on a saturday. We are in our 20s and not from az. We had high hopes but they were not met. Our waitress was not nice. We ordered two coffees and one crepe and a parfait. It took 15 minutes for her to bring us water and coffee.  People around us who showed up later than us all received there food before we did. It took 30 minutes for my friends crepe. They were not nice and treated us bad because we were in our 20s. It was horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Seriously tasty crepes! Breakfast and lunch crepes were tasty and produce was fresh and delightful"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times... the food is amazing, the service can be slow when their busy, otherwise it's fine. The staff is friendly, and it's a nice place to go and chat with friends and have a light lunch and something different than what's around in the local area. I'd check them out if you're looking for light, good and still healthy food."}
{"text":"Odd that there are two entries, but regardless I love this place and will gladly write two reviews. Love Terri, and the food is great."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious!   So many options and they get it right every time. They also provide pick up which is nice, since some crepe places don't."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast spot. The avocado mushroom crepe is fantastic, and the food is SOOOO CHEAP! Sometimes the wait is long on the weekends, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"My son and I went to Cupz N' Crepes yesterday for a late lunch.  We got there at about 1:10PM, no one ahead of us, and no one seated us...we took menus and went to the only open table.  They took the order right away, but it was 50 minutes until we got our crepes!  One gentleman near us tried to flag down a waitress several times to get silverware while his food sat getting cold on the table.  Several tables were not cleared.  Two waitresses (one I believe was actually a manager) were bickering about whose fault some error was and we could hear them!  I've always enjoyed their crepes but the service continues to go downhill...not sure it's worth a tasty crepe to put up with their bad service!"}
{"text":"My husband & I love this place. The coffee is amazing and I crave the crepes on a weekly basis. The fillings are always fresh and delicious. I love the people here & think the service is great. It's a family business and when we come here it feels like we're part of the family, and there are many local regulars who seem to feel the same way. The interior remodel looks great too. Free wifi is also a plus."}
{"text":"There is something to be said for doing a few things and doing them really well and that is Cupz and Crepes forte. The crepes, filled with a variety of sweet and savory fillings are always fresh and delicious. My fav, The Veggie, is filled with baby spinach, red onion, tomato and feta cheese...add pesto for an extra \"pop\". Yum. Coffee drinks are served to perfection in generous mismatched mugs by spunky servers in a very relaxing and inviting atmosphere. My favorite place to bring my computer and hang out with friends. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine reccommended this place because of the food, so we ventured out on a lazy Saturday morning. I was excited to try another non-chain resturant, and really wanted to like this place!   We walked in, and noticed the sign to seat yourselves. We were looking around the room for a table when, without even so much as a \"Hi\" or, \"How are you\", the waitress gruffly tells us her only table is outside. Okay, sorry. So we grabbed our menus and silverware and headed outside.   Approximately 10 minutes later we order water and coffee, boyfriend gets a ham and cheese crepe, I order a cream cheese and strawberry crepe. After quite a long wait the food comes out, and my crepe has no cream cheese, just plain strawberries and whipped cream. When I ask the waitress about it (nicely!)- thinking maybe they'd just made a mistake, she quite rudely says \"You didn't order a cream cheese crepe\" then invents a ficticious conversation where she had asked me if I wanted \"just whipped cream and strawberries\", and I said yes...  Despite the fact that that conversation never happened (she hardly said two words to us when we ordered!), my boyfriend AND the people at the table next to us heard me order the cream cheese and strawberry crepe. Plus, I don't even think there's an option on the menu for just a whipped cream and strawberry crepe...  There were no offers to correct the mistake, no apology, nothing. Just an accusation that I didn't know what I ordered, and what did I want her to do about it... Also not a single offer of a refill of water or coffee throughout the meal. Not wanting to sit there for another 20 minutes to wait for our check, boyfriend went inside to pay. Again, that took about 10 minutes because despite having three people behind the counter, not a single person acknowledged him.   WOW! I will admit the food was pretty good (although I really was craving the strawberries and cream cheese...). But we will not be back- because of the service!"}
{"text":"First of all Try the Nutella crepe!!! The BLT crepe is great too! The owners are very kind. The only disadvantage to coming here is the service is very slow. Sometimes you will be waiting for someone to come great you for about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"So accommodating! My daughter has a severe nut allergy and they cleaned the crepe machine so there won't be any cross contamination. The crepes were very good! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch on Saturday and was very satisfied. It was not extremely busy but we were in around 2pm so I did not expect a large crowd. The food and service were very good and the price was very reasonable.  I had a spinach tomato cheese and egg breakfast crepe. My boyfriend had the bacon cheese and egg breakfast crepe. We split a peanut butter banana and Nutella crepe for dessert which was very rich. They are very accommodating and will pretty much add anything to a pre existing menu crepe that you ask for. I would recommend this for a lighter breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Thought the Shirley was delicious but the service left much to be desired. The waitress seemed annoyed that I didn't know the routine (have a seat at a table, they'll serve you. This is confusing because you walk in and there's a giant counter with a register up front. When they give you the bill you have to take it there to pay.) I sort of stood around until she told me what to do. It seemed to take a long time to get my food, even though there were only 3 of us in there. The waitress seemed irritable. Hopfully it was just a off day. The food was great."}
{"text":"You can find us at Cupz n' Crepes at least twice a week! I have several \"regulars\" that I rotate between and my husband usually gets a bagel. We love their brewed coffee - it is outstanding. The service cannot be beat, not only do they arrive at our table with our coffee in hand but they are attentive throughout the meal. The crepes are the best and there are so many to choose from. You can get sweet to savory and they have several already listed in the menu or simply put together the combo that sounds best to you - they'll give you what you want, every time. And that's one of the things I like best about them; you get the same great service the first time you go in as you do the 1,000th time you go in! Not far off the freeway so worth the drive even if you live in Tempe or Chandler but there's no excuse in not going no matter what part of Ahwatukee you live! And the WiFi is free!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I always order the hot latte and strawberry with nutella crepes...I just don't like their schedule, they close too early"}
{"text":"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!!! This is a great local restaurant that you should experience. The staff is wonderful and friendly, the setting is quaint and the crepes are to die for. I had a breakfast crepe and e en though it was pretty filling I had to order another type of crepe just because it was so good."}
{"text":"Absolutely no gluten free options, I have no idea why when I search gluten free yelp comes up with this place. Only possible thing to get is fruit.  Service is terrible, we've been waiting for at least 45 minutes for fruit and two crepes.  Overall, we won't be back to this place. Not only have we been waiting over an hour now, but the staff isn't all too friendly. Clearly they are trying but unfortunately, not succeeding."}
{"text":"Nice family owned restaurant in Ahwatukee. The decor is a Paris style cafe with small tables inside and out as well as a lounge area.  The staff is friendly and the menu is large for their size. The menu includes a large variety of breakfast, lunch and dessert crepes.  The crepe is handmade at the time you order it.  The taste is very close to the ones I had in Paris.  My favorites are the bacon, egg and cheese and the Nutella and bananas.   A nice place to meet friends for a cup of coffee or to sit and read."}
{"text":"We go here occasionally and it's just what it says. Good crepes and coffee and nice atmosphere. Always had good service"}
{"text":"I love getting breakfast here. The atmosphere has a quaint charm to it that definitely makes me want to hang out while I enjoy my coffee. Speaking of coffee, the House Blend coffee here is to die for. Definitely take the time to get a cup. Furthermore, the food here is amazing. My personal favorite is the blueberry and cream cheese crepe. It is the perfect combination of sweet and savory and makes for a wonderful first meal. Definitely come to Cupz 'N' Crepes."}
{"text":"Had the Shirley Crepe.  Very solid.  Bunch of experimental lattes too, although I wasn't adventurous enough to try chili pepper in mine (what a wimp, right?)  A little bit of a wait, but worth it for sure.  Very friendly staff.  Clean.  Nice ambiance.  First date worthy (for scrubs like me anyways.)  I'm not the world's preeminent authority on crepe quality, by any means, but I can't see many people coming here just to regret it. Go get your crepe on son!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the Shirley and the going bananas' version as well. The breakfast crepes are also fantastic. Since I can never decide between spinach and mushroom I always add one or the other :) The staff is really friends and the Parisian cafe atmosphere ver relaxing."}
{"text":"I've ignored this place for years because Crepes are French and the last time I ate at a French place they tried to feed me food that wasn't even cooked and they wanted to charge me like $100 for it and I had to say, \"No sir, you take that back to the kitchen and put it in the oven\" but my wife finally convinced me to try this place and let me tell you what - crepes are ok.  There are only three things you need to know about this place: 1. They've got a lot of crepes. A crepe is like soft tortilla without a lot of flavor. You put stuff in it, and eat it, and the crepe works with basically anything because it's not a strong taste. So we had a chicken crepe, a BLT crepe, and a PBJ crepe. All were great, and all very different experiences.  2. This place is pretty cool in terms of being friendly and family friendly. The waitresses were cool, and did a lot to help keep my tiny, tiny son entertained.  3. It's not super fast, but it's not super slow either. And it's popular. We showed up, there were no open tables, and there were people waiting in like for coffee or something like that. It only took us about 5 minutes to get seated, but I could easily see it taking longer on a weekend, so just plan ahead."}
{"text":"This place is okay.  The crepes are pretty good.  I've had the turkey and avocado one and a veggie one.  The spinach salad with dried cranberries and almonds has a poppy-seed dressing that is way too sweet.  I guess I should I ask for it on the side."}
{"text":"My first time ever eating a crepe. I tought they were ok. My daughter & I shared a sweet & a savory crepe and a strawberry Italian soda. It was good but not great to where I cant wait to go back. Its in the same complex as my daughters gym, so we decided to try ot out"}
{"text":"May not be the best crepes, but by far the best thing we've got in Ahwatukee and a very nice place for brunch! Sometimes a little slow and a little pricey, but usually worth it!"}
{"text":"I have been meeting friends here for along time, and I still keep coming back because of the great mix of atmosphere, service, and quality food.  The owners are very friendly, and know our drink orders us well enough to have them served as we pick out a table and sit down.  The recent decoration change has added a nice theme and fresh look, the red color is more lively than what it was before.  I have tried every item except the salads, guess I just like the crepes so much more than rabbit food.  The food is just enough filling that you are neither stuffed or hungry, and the quality has always been great.  I never have heard any once complain or send anything back.    Usually the noise level is not too loud, but it could be if it was very crowded.  Many times I see people there with laptops.  I wonder if they are really working, or just pretending to be working..."}
{"text":"I was recommended there by a friend so I decided to try it out.  Went on on a Thursday morning about 830am, the place was about half full.  Charming decor as my friend had told me,  sadly that is where the joy ended.  I waited literally 15 minutes in this very small cafe like setting to be greeted.  Watched the server come and go around me and not once did she say \"I'll be right with you\"  or anything to acknowledge my existence.  Which certainly I appreciate when I see a server struggling,  \"in the weeds' or dealing with another party per say. Another table that sat 5 minutes after me was greeted first, received their drinks, and then I was greeted with no mention as to any delay.  I ordered an avocado, tomato crepe w no cheese.  It was fine, rather bland and I ordered salsa to help it achieve some much needed flavor.  The waitress never mentioned that I pay at the front register so I waited quite a long time with my credit card on the table waiting to have it ran, as that is the typical process for most sit down cafes/restaurants. Finally when I figured it out I went to the front and asked for a to go cup for my tea from the server,  I then  proceeded to wait as the server went to take other orders while I stood at the register waiting for a to go cup...  Overall it wasn't terrible,  but other than the fact that it's decor is adorable and it offers a vast selection of crepes,  I would not make an effort to return due to the poor service and less than phenomenal crepes."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch. Good crepes, great drinks and salads."}
{"text":"Only reason I am giving 3 stars is because the food and coffee are consistently great!  The service on the other hand.... My last visit it took nearly an hour to get our two crepes and not one refill of coffee.  I have been here a few times and in all instances I would have to agree with the posters previously who have stated that a person could feel more like a burden to wait on than a actual paying customer.  I don't necessarily blame the wait staff, I just think they need more help during the busy times.....and an occasional smile wouldn't hurt either.  I have debated returning each time but somehow the tastiness of the crepes keeps me coming back.  I'll just return on the off peak hours, I guess."}
{"text":"We went here the other day and I was very excited to try it out. The place was decorated nicely, had clean bathrooms, and had a cozy feeling to it. The staff was fairly nice and we didn't have to wait to order. I've never tried a crepe before so I ordered a strawberry and whip cream one.  The crepes looked delicious when they brought them out and had very good plate appearance. The downside was that all of our crepes were soggy which made it hard to eat them.  Also, behind the counter seems to be not the cleanest which made me a little sketched out as I was eating.  I'm not sure if we will be back-my boyfriend wasn't too impressed by the food- but hopefully the crepes will be better and the back will be cleaner if we do."}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars I would. I LOVE this place. I have been coming in for the last 3 years or so. Took my son there for breakfast on his birthday and opened his gifts in the couch area. The food. Omg. The crepes are amazing. My favorite is the Nutella, strawberries and banana. And the turkey pesto is another must have. Looking forward to my next trip!"}
{"text":"My family and I come here all the time. Service and food is always exemplary and I can't help but brag to my friends. So far, they have all loved it! Terrie and Gina are always so kind and Rick makes better crepes than an authentic Parisian. I hope they stay open long enough for me to bring my kids out when I'm older. Can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place one star because the crepes are not that bad. However, every single time I've been here the service has been absolutely HORRIBLE. The staff is rude, unresponsive, and flat out mean. I thought it was just me but all my friends who have gone here have never gone back because of how bad the Customer Service is. Not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Wonderful customer service and excellent food! My two favorites are the pepperoni and cheese crepe on the kids menu. Even though it is on the kids menu it is the same size as all the other ones! I also love the Nutella, strawberry and banana. Full of fresh fruit and so filling! The crepes are made fresh when you order them! The coffees are also well made with tons of flavoring options. Well priced and definitely worth every penny! Go there after every early release from school!"}
{"text":"Great local eatery. Nice to have an alternative to the regular options. Wonderful selection of Harney & Sons tea. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Although slightly higher priced than I expected, I LOVE this place!!! Great atmosphere with Paris Cafe type decor. Yummy Chai, super nice owners, and really great breakfast! They have steady customers at any given time so the wait time it takes to get your order varies. Any wait is worth it! I highly recommend my fav... Strawberry and banana crepe with Nutella on the side, extra whip cream!!! A lot of food and almost too pretty to eat. But I manage usually once a week with my daughter."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place. So many people really seem to enjoy this eatery, but I was not impressed.   The atmosphere of the location isn't bad- though I've attempted to eat here on the weekend, only to be forced to sit outside in the sun because there was no room to eat inside, and apparently it never occurred to them to let me wait for a table (I ended up leaving before eating during that visit).   This time, though, there were few people in the restaurant. It was nice and quiet. The service, in my opinion, was rather slow despite the lack of patrons. I ended up ordering a hot tea and a ham, egg & cheese crepe.   The tea was okay. It looks like they're using a higher quality tea, but it tasted a lot like tap water to me- so I ended up tasting more of the water and less of the tea.   The crepe was bad. I couldn't even finish mine. It was soggy and reminded me of a tortilla more than a crepe.   And on top of that, no one bothered to ask if everything looked okay. If the food was good, or if I or my companion needed anything.   I'd rather go eat at the crepe bar instead."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and have always enjoyed the crepes and lattes until this morning.  About half way through my crepe I bit down on something hard.  Thankfully I didn't swallow it as I discovered this was a very sharp piece of ceramic!  I showed our waiter (who I believe is also one of the owners) and she took the piece of ceramic, grabbed the plate with the other half of my crepe and just walked off with no apology.  When she finally came back she explained that a piece of the ceramic spoon used to stir the cream cheese broke off into the mix.  Again no apology and she walked away.  She returned a few minutes later with our bill and stated she took the one crepe off and walked away.  Again no apology.  When I looked at the bill she had removed the crepe but also added another charge for something we didn't even order so we had to ask her to adjust the bill.  In summary, food is great but customer service not so much.  I would have appreciated an apology and an offer to bring me a new breakfast."}
{"text":"Color me impressed, the turkey pesto crepe is really good.  Nice place to hang out or come for a meal."}
{"text":"Everything there is delicious.  Strawberry and Nutella or even add bananas. My personal favorite is their Sunshine crepe that has granola and yogurt.  Cinnamon crepe is a good snack sized one.  Love the quaint atmosphere."}
{"text":"My family and I are such huge fans of this restaurant. The food is stellar! Great portions. Consistent. Service is excellent. My 13-month-old daughter loves coming here. The staff always remembers her and pays her extra attention. And she's a big fan of the blueberry crepe. Very family oriented. The chai tea latte is a dream. I highly reccommend."}
{"text":"The food is great! I recommend the Graceland.  However, customer service is very poor. The entire staff, which is very small, look very unhappy working there. I keep coming back because of the delicious food but the poor customer service is starting to take its toll. Like many of the other reviews, we all agree that the staff is very unfriendly. It doesn't matter if they are busy or not, they will still take awhile to greet you, get your drink order, etc. Also, I recommend asking for the check as soon as they deliver the food as they probably won't be coming back.  It's a shame because the food is amazing--I just wish they had great service and the place would have the whole package!"}
{"text":"Very good. It was extremely busy, so I thought that the service would be slow, but it wasn't. Good food-creeps are a bit thicker and heartier than I've had, but both the savory and the sweet ones were crammed full. Good decor-the place has regulars, which is a tribute to the good service and food. My only wish is that they get a \"seat yourself\" or a \"please wait to be seated sign\" and a \"take out\" sign for first timers."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! They need to hire people that have actually worked in the restaurant industry before.  They are just entirely tooooo slow!!!!!! The staff acts as if they do not know what to do!!! Incompetence on the highest level!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The sweet crepes are great. From classic simple lemon juice to the Nutella bananas . But the savory crepes are quite run of the mill, uninspired. But the coffee and the relaxed coffee shop vibe is welcoming. But the service is uneven, and a fly bothered us on the last two visits.  Was undecided between four stars or three, until I ate crepes today in San Jose, CA. Smoked salmon, and fast friendly service. A good reference point, so overall it really is a three star place. But come in for coffee with friends and share a sweet crepe? Then maybe five stars!"}
{"text":"I was not a big fan of crepes.... just wasn't my thing I guess. I saw Cupz n' Crepes in passing and suggested to try it and it was delicious!!! Friendly owner and staff. Highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Have to give this place 2 stars mainly because the service was bad.  Makes it hard to enjoy a nice breakfast out when the waitress doesn't smile or refill your coffee.  The crepes were alright.  A bit too bland for my taste.  The dessert crepes were probably the best part about this place but I feel like I can just turn around and easily make them at home.  I personally would rather spend my money on more flavorful and complex food where the staff is more pleasant."}
{"text":"AWFUL LEARN HOW TO RUN A RESTAURANT!!  Decent food but who wants to wait 2 hours for a crape?? All the guest look at each other like What the heck is going on. Pathetic!!"}
{"text":"Yummm!! I had the fresh berries, yogurt and granola crepe while my wife had the banana, peanut butter, and honey and my daughter had an egg, bacon and cheddar and we all enjoyed them.  The crepes themselves were a little thicker and chewier than I'd prefer but the flavors were well paired.  Coffee was of Starbucks quality but a few cents cheaper"}
{"text":"Delicious! I love the dessert crepes, I could probably eat all of them in one sitting. Today I ordered the Strawberry Nutella crepe and it is to die for. Just the right amount of cream, nutella, and strawberries to make the crepe a delicious treat instead of a sugar overload. I will say that the service is not the best. The lady who served us (I'm pretty sure the restaurant owner) was not friendly towards my table at all and no one greeted us as we came in or left."}
{"text":"Downgrading them a star.  The crepes are still tip top.  This time I had the Chicken Supreme and my co-worker ordered a custom crepe with egg and some veggies and they were served hot and fresh as always.  Very good!    BUT... it took *forever* to get them!  In their favor, it was pretty crowded, but it looks like they still have one of the staff on waitress duty, one on hostessing and only one chef after a few years in business.  That formula seemed to work well when they opened because there were only a few people there on any given visit.  Fast forward to 2013 with a full house, me and company hunkered over our smartphones next to the giant spoon and fork.  It took about 5 minutes to get our order in and almost 30 minutes to get our order on the table.  I saw others waiting and fidgeting around us, too.  Forget the days of yore when they'd return mid-meal to ask if we wanted to get another crepe.  They didn't bother this go-round.  We went to the cash register without waiting to see if they delivered the tab to our table.    Rule of thumb:  If they're busy, give yourself ample time to get service or call ahead and take out.  They get a little apprehensive about not giving it to you fresh off the pan if you're not already on site, but they pulled it off the one time I gave to-go a try.  In house, order something substantial.  Getting seconds may not be in the cards."}
{"text":"I wondered why I hadn't heard about this place since I used to live within walking distance and a friend works next door. I gave this rating two stars, as I usually award-2 for service, 2 for food, and the 5th star for overall experience and desire to return.   I walked in late Monday morning (not busiest time) and said hello to the lady at the counter and toddler next to her. I always smile but did not get any eye contact when I explained I had never been in before and was excited to try it. I asked how it works...where to order etc. I wanted to enjoy the rainy weather with a new book and eat in. But she mumbled something and went to make coffee, the little girl played with the register and money. (Cricket, cricket) Then I asked the toddler if her name was Bonnie and she said naa, so much for my icebreaker. About 5 minutes pass and the server (Gina displayed on receipt) came back to take my order and at that time I decided to get it to go. I ordered the nutella/banana/strawberry crepe and a mocha, which she said would be \"up in like 2 minutes\". Wow that is FAST, how impressive and I wasn't in any hurry. I awkwardly shifted around the entrance and back wall trying to find a place to stand as the next 25 minutes rolled by. When I stood in back she told me my coffee was up front...which scolded my tongue ouch! I said it is so hot I burned my tongue and would like a couple ice cubes. Yet again no eye contact or comment and she poured in 2 ice cubes. Let me just say I love my coffee but damn that hurt! I also understand fresh quality food isn't instantaneous but would have appreciated a realistic estimate. After trying the crepe I realized it's not my favorite food as I don't like warm bananas and strawberries-no stars taken off that is just my personal taste.   My philosophy is I'm spending money at a local business, welcome me and give me the run down. I did not feel welcome at all. It's not difficult to glance up with a smile and acknowledge a NEW customer to make a good first impression. This is an adorably quaint restaurant and although small it would have been a great place for small meetings. I watched 2 couples come in while I waited and they were not greeted warmly either. Considering these service related factors I'll continue to go to #WHEREUBEAN for coffee and pastries."}
{"text":"The coffee, food and staff are great!  They always recognize me when I come and know my \"regular\" order -- and when I'm in the mode for something else, they are always flexible to customize my crepes.  Highly recommend for breakfast, brunch and lunch."}
{"text":"This morning, a co-worker and I visited Cupz N' Crepes for a working breakfast. We frequently use the Enterprise Rent-a-Car located a few doors down, and had noticed the cute signage for the new shop. Instead of hitting a Starbucks or Einstein's, we decided to take a peek at this new place.  What a treat! I enjoyed a sweet crepe filled with Nutella and bananas and topped with fresh whipped cream. It was delicious! My co-worker had the Nutella, bananas and strawberries - also fabulous.   In addition, we had drinks. I had a white mocha and my co-worker had a chai tea.   Besides sweet crepes, they also offer savory crepes, salads and bagels.   The entire place was comfy and cozy with great seating and free Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection of crepes and other items. Great cafe au lait! They are happy to adjust the ingredients if requested. Lovely staff and great, relaxed atmosphere. We went twice over the five days were were in town."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting Cupz N' Crepes. I was very disappointed with their customer service.  The waiters didn't greet me and let you stand there (in front of her) and she continues on with her job.  She is not friendly and seem to pick and choose who she wants to take care of or not. When I finally sat down at the table, I had to wait about another 15 minutes before anyone works there realized that I haven't been given a menu. Total Ridiculous. Once I placed my order, I waited another 15 minutes before my food arrived.  Total time spent there was 1 hour between waiting to be seated, waited for services and waited for food. Horrible customer service and food was okay."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a nice non-chain breakfast spot & we have certainly found one here!! This is a nice small cafe-style restaurant that specializes in crepes.  The ones we tried were the turkey pesto, a breakfast cheese, avocado & mushroom, and from the sweet menu, The Shirley. All 3 were so delish!!  One thing that we noticed, being mushroom lovers, is they did not skimp on the mushrooms. One of my biggest peeves is when go to order a mushroom dish & you only get like three or four in your entree. The mushroom crepe was loaded :) and it was very much appreciated!!  All the crepes were good portions. All were cooked perfectly, not over or undercooked. Our sweet one, The Shirley, we were able to split between three of us! Perfect finish to our meal :) Great service and atmosphere as well! Good job Cupz N' Crepes! We will certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for about 5 years  now.  I don't usually go on weekends which is probably when other reviewers are experiencing longer wait times,  but anywhere you go that is good,  will have wait times.  And the fact that this is a family owned business,  with amazing food makes the wait very well worth it in my book.    I always order the same thing... Cheddar cheese,  bacon,  spinach,  avocado,  and tomato... And every time the food is consistent and delicious!  I love the way I experience all of the flavors throughout the whole crepe (and yes...  I eat every bite).   The owner is very nice and remembers her customers names  (and there are many regulars).  They offer free WiFi and are so generous in allowing people to come in and work and even plug in as needed.    I love this coffee and crepe shop and will continue to visit and refer to all my friends."}
{"text":"Love the food here! Service not so much! When I was brought the wrong order, I was told that was what she wrote down so there was no offer to bring the correct dish. I am very sure that I did not order ham since I hate ham and ended up picking it out of my crepe.She doesnt seem to feel that the customer should be able to have what they want ."}
{"text":"Nice to find a good crepe's restaurant in my new 'hood ;)   After a couple hours of hiking the trails at South Mountain, we were kinda famished (& thirsty). Yelp'ed a few options and decided on this one- crepe's sounded yummy.  It was busy on a mid-Sunday morning, yet just two parties ahead of us waiting for tables. It was hot outside (PHOENIX ;p, its a given) but definitely \"cooler\" than the past few days. Hungry = getting cold drinks and deciding to sit outside.   It actually was comfortable, and we were able to order & get our food quickly. Simple menu, great options. My friend went wit the featured special, I built my own savory crepe. Devoured. We both got nutella crepes for \"dessert\"....not as good as my spot I found in San Diego, though good nonetheless. It was starting to really heat up so the whipped creme melted literally as soon as they were brought to us. Okay with me, since I wasn't gonna eat it anyway but it was funny. Waitress brought us extra glasses of water- she knew we were in the \"warm\" area- great service.  Greatly priced, fast and pleasant service, great size portions. This may be a tradition in the making. ;p"}
{"text":"I wish I had this place closer to my home.  I love the atmosphere it is friendly, inviting and cozy.  It's perfect to enjoy some delicious food and coffee or just run in to get coffee before work.  It is made to perfection and the prices are very reasonable compared to other coffee shops.  The crepes are light and fresh.  I have had the nutella and strawberry crepe and all I have to say is can I get another. please!!  They have specialty lattes with seasonal selections.  My last latte was a pumpkin latte, and don't tell anyone at Starbucks, but it was hands down the best pumpkin latte I have had!  If you're in the area, I would recommend stopping by for a bite to eat and a cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Great savory crepes. And the desert crepes . . . WOW!  Definitely a new favorite."}
{"text":"Hey y'all!   I'm a big crepe fan, and normally go to Italian restaurants to get em, but my boyfriend suggested this place, so I figured I'd give it a go.  I got the BLTA (Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato, Avocado), he got a Pizza-Esque crepe, and we shared a strawberry Nutella for dessert.    Everything was FANTASTIC!  The ingredients were fresh and so so flavorful.  The waitress whom I think is the owner, was super sweet and always very attentive.    Since this first positive experience, we've been back several times, and have gotten the same quality food & service.  We will be patrons for years to come.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place was all I expected it to be and more! Per a recommendation from a fellow Yelper I tried the \"Shirley\" Crepe. The crepe was warm and pleasantly chewy but not overly so. The chocolate sauce, Nutella and Cream Cheese harmoniously suited the fresh Strawberries. I literally ate this crepe up in less than 10 minutes it was so good! I also had a Blended Carmel Latte which was equally good but too sweet to eat with my crepe. Make sure you stick with black coffee if you want to get a sweet crepe. My sister went for a more simpler crepe; the \"sugar and cinnamon\". She also raved about the texture and perfect sweetness. Next time I go back I think I'll try a savory crepe.  The atmosphere is really laid back, fairly quite unless someone orders something blended. The service is a little on the slow side but not so slow to negatively affect the overall experience. So what are you waiting for? Go try a Crepe today!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite weekend breakfast stop. It is local and family owned so the service is a bit quirky and they don't always take your order fast. Or cook it fast sometimes. And there seems to be a little east coast surliness some mornings, which I like.  But to me it is just what Ahwatukee needs, a place to have a coffee/chai, have a conversation with friends or family, read a magazine or fiddle with your iPad, and get a good crepe.   But if the pace or service bugs you, there is a Cracker Barrel just down the street.    The crepes are yummy. Not like ones you get in London or Paris, or even Seattle for that matter. But for suburban Phoenix they are great. My guess is it is the ingredients. Not as fresh maybe?    The selection of crepes is good, and they have always accommodated any requests or custom orders.  I've had most of the \"cupz\" offerings as well and they are all good, hot or cold. My kids like the Italian sodas.   I wish they had a bigger patio with a better view than the parking lot, but it is a strip mall and they do well with what they have. The decor is cute \"Paris\" without being over the top and they have books and coloring for the kids. They also have a couch area with a TV for any catching critical sporting events that might be on.   The business level is unpredictable. Light during the week it can be packed on weekend mornings, but is sometimes empty.   I recommend the eggs, ham and cheese for breakfast or the nutella and bananas for sweet crepes.   I kind of wish they were open late. It would be great for coffee and desert crepes."}
{"text":"Love eating here! I try and go at least once a week. The staff is friendly and great to converse with. The food is always excellent and you cannot beat the prices! I try and take as many friends as I can for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"I really like this neighborhood restaurant. They have a pretty extensive menu of options or you can just build your own.  I usually stick with an egg based one for breakfast.  The Cheese Avocado & Mushroom add Egg is my personal favorite. They are a good size and service is pretty prompt. The staff is nice and make pretty good espresso drinks in the times I have .  I usually always get a mocha and they are quite good. It has a comfortable atmosphere  and plenty of room to sit down and take a break.  I'll have to come by and try them for lunch even though I usually stick to breakfast :)  Try: - Cheese Avocado & Mushroom + egg - Mocha"}
{"text":"I'm here about four times a week. Obviously because the food and the coffee are delicious but also because the staff makes me feel welcomed and loved :) Sometimes they get super busy and there's always just one or two people serving there, so just sit back and relax, your food and coffee will be so worth it!"}
{"text":"Brought our daughter to our favorite place! The owner, Terri, is so welcoming and recommended the peach vanilla Italian soda for her and she loved it. We vary between the savory and the sweet here, but have never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"The Italiano crepe was salty pepperoni perfection! Maybe that's because I'm Italian, and biased towards Italiano-anything. But more likely it was the fact that even though the pepperoni was the pre-sliced, supermarket variety, and the added olives and mushrooms had clearly spent the past year or so in a can, they balanced in perfect harmony with the salty ham, the thick, gooey mozzarella cheese and the perfectly crisp crepe. Not a \"gourmet\" crepe, sure, but a _damn_ tasty one!  I'm from out of town and their free WiFi was a lifesaver, allowing me get some important work done while I'm away at a conference. Oh, the iced tea and the service were great too!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late breakfast recently.  We were in Phoenix for a few days vacation and consulted Yelp for a breakfast place not far from our resort.   We were not disappointed.  We didn't want anything fancy, just fresh, tasty, and hot.  This was just the place.  Lots of strawberries in my son's crepe-so many that he couldn't eat them all.  I had a Monte Cristo crepe and it was exactly what I wanted...sweet and savory.  We also shared a banana and cream cheese crepe with caramel drizzle and whipped cream.  The crepes themselves were also good.  Would definitely eat here again if we are in the area.   It wasn't completely slammed at the time we were there(Saturday late morning)but my guess is it could get that way.  It's a spacious place in spite of being in a strip mall type setting, albeit a nice strip mall.  The area is pleasant enough."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years but recently went with my sister for brunch. We sat outside and our service gal was great: friendly, quick and good with recommendations.   I had the BLT crepe (everything else seemed like a bit boring) and it was well made but nothing \"craveable\" or really memorable. ..i sort of wish they had a more adventurous savory crepe menu. ..buuut, they don't. Oh well. .maybe I'll stick to the sweet crepes next time. I'm not expecting Crepe Bar level adventurous, just something different instead of typical sandwich ingredients inside a crepe... like maybe one of Goat cheese topped with walnut halves and prosciutto... that's different, right? Cuz most of these combos i could just get at a paradise bakery-like chain place. Their crepe batter itself is good, a good foundation, that is.   The iced Toddy was very very enjoyable and i chugged that baby down quickly. .. What they make, they make well; their service was great and i enjoyed my house drink..so this is a 3.75 star place :)"}
{"text":"While visiting a friend in Ahwatukee, my wife and I ate at this amazing brunch place. Our creeps we're freshly made and were outstanding. The vibe there was very laid back. If we had this place in Chicago, I'd be there every week. Though it's a very busy place, the staff seem to genuinely enjoy what they do and provide good service."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and ate here for lunch. We loved everything we tried. Had the turkey pesto, which was our favorite. The lady that waited on us was super nice and friendly (short brown hair and glasses). Really cute decor, would be a great spot to just go and have coffee as well. Also amazing prices, less than $7 per crepe and we did not leave hungry.   Went back again a few days later for breakfast. They were really slow (the waitress warned us and we were in no hurry so we didn't mind, but just FYI if you are trying to get in and out quickly on a Sunday). Again, had the same waitress from the couple days before who was super nice. She wasn't great about drink refills or checking after we got our food, but she seemed to be waiting on every single table in the place, bussing the tables and making  drinks so I don't blame her - seems just like they need to hire a few more people. She seems to be the one keeping this place moving so kudos to her! There was another with waitress with tattoos (nothing against them, just what I remembered) who was rude to almost everyone who walked in, even when they were friendly with her. She seemed to do about 25% of the work (not sure if any table was actually solely hers), while ours did the other 75%. The breakfast crepes we had were really blan with not a lot of flavor - crepe itself was just as good as the first time, but the filling lacked anything exciting. We had the ham, egg and cheese (had to put salt, pepper and hot sauce on it before I even wanted to finish eating it), my mom had the tomato, spinach, egg and cheese (spinach was not sautéed and was cold). Again both really blan.   Great place to go with girlfriends.   In conclusion, I probably won't return for breakfast, but will return frequently for lunch!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a small shopping center, Cupz and Crepes is an Ahwatukee treasure. Recently it's become even more popular, but it has stayed true to quality and  taste. Always, always get the Strawberry, Banana and Nutella crepe before leaving!"}
{"text":"My friend invited me here for brunch and it was really good! Crepes aren't really my preferred brunch food, but I really liked the quality and texture of these crepes--they were thicker and more breadlike than what I've typically seen. We had:  Pizza Crepe: it's not actually called this on the menu, but that's essentially what it is. My friend ordered this and it looked amazing so I'd try it if I ever went back!  Avocado/Bacon/Mushroom/Mozzarella Crepe: I made a custom one and it was bomb af. Kinda tasted like a BLT fell apart in a crepe...minus the lettuce and tomato...okay so maybe not actually a BLT...but just as good!  Dessert Crepe: bananas, strawberries, nutella, cream cheese, whipped cream, chocolate sauce.....extremely good.   I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Came her with my fiance and had lattes and crepes. The latte was absolutely delightful with the perfect flavor we were looking for! We ordered a savory crepe, delicious and filling even though we shared. Went back the next day with my daughter for her birthday breakfast and she Loved it! They even put a sparkler in her crepe. Perfect setting for a sweet or savory sensation."}
{"text":"First time here and I couldn't be more satisfied. The food is served in tasteful, generous portions. The crepes are especially fulfilling and their hot chocolate is delicious. We definitely will be returning here soon!"}
{"text":"Cute interior and good food. It's located in an unassuming strip mall. The restaurant is self seating for breakfast on the weekends, not sure if it's like that rest of the time. I ordered a modified breakfast crepe of bacon, egg, mushroom, and avocado. The crepe was crunchy that mixed well with the savory filling ingredients. The service was a bit slow for sit down dinning but perfect for a slow weekend morning. The staff is friendly and quick to resolve issues with orders."}
{"text":"This cute little place has started to grow on me, if you are looking for cheerleaders to take your order or fast service this might not be your place. I have been here numerous times and when you realize it is what it is, all is good. Crepes are great! I had a egg, bacon, and cheese one this am. It's nice to have great coffee with your breakfast. It's very laid back and they have the same three people working here everyday."}
{"text":"This place was simply amazing. I went here with a friend for breakfast and we were met with an amazingly accommodating and friendly staff, a dizzying array of lattes (my absolute favorite), a plentiful menu of sweet and savory crepes, and a well-cultivated atmosphere. For a local, neighborhood fold of France, this was the perfect spot. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am a chef and crepes is an absolute one of my favorite things to eat. I dont really have time to cook much so i rather go out and eat. I went to IHOP to try their crepes and they tasted like plastic well I went to this place and they kinda tasted like plastic as well. They didnt blow me away at all so I guess I have to continue making my own!!! Nice idea though."}
{"text":"This place has been around for years, and I just made my way over last week. There's a huge selection of different crepes (both savory and sweet), and the prices are very affordable. I personally love the honey and strawberry crepes; they're definitely generous with their portions, and I feel as though I had a half container of strawberries on my plate. It was delicious! The restaurant is super casual, and it can be a bit cramped. It takes a while to get your food, but it sure is worth it once it arrives!"}
{"text":"What a great little place this is! Plus who doesn't love supporting local businesses!?!  I had the pleasure of sipping on a delightful vanilla latte which was served in an oversized mug, my favorite, and enjoyed a delicious breakfast crepe filled with mozzarella cheese, fresh tomorrow's, spinach and mushrooms.   My friend and I had the opportunity to catch up, while sitting on the comfy black chairs in the back of the restaurant.  I highly recommend this place. Sit and enjoy a yummy latte, they have many flavors including holiday ones, and indulge in a crepe. The staff will take great care of you."}
{"text":"My rating scale:   (Only food and drink quality considered for rating. Usually worldwide comparison rating given unless otherwise noted in description)  1 Star - Terrible.

Would return.  5 Star - Excellent. The best representation. Would definitely return.     The crepe was made well even though i just had peanut butter and apricot to go off and the latte hit the spot."}
{"text":"Customer service here was horrible...crepes were average- not worth the 45+ minute wait and the lady server w tattoos and piercings has mastered the art of acknowledging your presence but ignoring you"}
{"text":"Let me first off start by saying that I am by no means a mushroom fan, but I got a savory crepe with mushrooms inside and was not disappointed. It was so tasty. I also got a great vanilla latte! The service was great and the inside is so cute. I loved the Parisian flair. I could almost picture myself back in France with all the different crepes! Can't wait to go back and try a new one!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant three times now and I have had such a nice experience. The decor is cozy and very Paris oriented, but with whimsy. The food is delicious!  I had tried a different crepe each time. This is a lovely place to have a coffee, Italian soda or a meal. Today I had the chicken with vegetable crepe, and my daughter had the BLT crepe. She also got a root beer Italian soda. I took a sip, oh so delicious! This is Mother's day and we arrived around 1:00 pm. We waited, but not long. All I have to say about this dining experience is yum, yum, yum!  You must go here and experience the cuisine for yourself! There is seating outside and inside. I have seen water bowls for the dogs outside."}
{"text":"This place is great. Its a little family owned place with great fresh food at good prices. I have had a few different crepes (Chicken Supreme, Blueberries and Cream Cheese, Apple Cinnamon and I think I had an Egg, cheese and Bacon one). I have to say for the savory ones, the Chicken Supreme is awesome, fresh smell and taste of the Pesto and spinach with Mozzarella is a great combo.  I've seen some reviews about the service being slow or bad but I guess it depends on your expectations. I go here after hiking at South Mountain and I am not in a rush for anything. I was going there 1 to 2 times a week for a few months but recently haven't had the time to make over there. Instead of coming out to refill my iced tea they started just leaving a small pitcher on the table for me and my friends which I preferred. At the end of our meal they provided to go cups for the iced tea too. So, to me the service was good.  If it wasn't 20-25 minutes from me, I would still be going there weekly."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday with my husband and we were quickly seated by an apathetic waitress.  When I asked her to clarify where she wanted us to sit she shrugged her shoulders and told us to \"just pick a table.\"  We ordered two lattes and two crepes, which I'm surprised didn't take too long to come out. The food we ordered was pretty average. After we were done eating and our table was cleared I mentioned we had a coupon and she told me, \"We'll have to take care of it at the counter.\"  She never came by with the check and when I got up and asked if I paid at the counter she seemed annoyed and said something under her breath that made both my husband and I a little uncomfortable.    I don't think we will be coming back here, at least anytime soon. I'd rather wait 30 minutes and pay more at the Crepe Bar in Tempe than to have lackluster service and a standard crepe."}
{"text":"If you like savory crepes, this is your place. I haven't tried a crepe here I didn't love. And the owner is the best."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere and the food was really good..I had never had crepes as a meal only dessert. It was fabulous!! More stars could have been had but the service was super slow...she was talking and forgot she was our waitress...."}
{"text":"My daughter and I love this place. We've eaten here a couple times since moving to Ahwatukee. It's a nice some Coffee shop ambiance. Love their selection of of espresso drinks. They have s chalk board in the front of weekly specials on coffee/espresso drinks. The crepes are good as well. They are a bit thicker than what I have had before, but the toppings are delicious. I will continue to visit. I'm a satisfied customer!"}
{"text":"Really cute little place, but the service could not be slower. Great coffee though, I must say."}
{"text":"Rude first words said to my son when being handed food is \"I bet this will end up on the floor, you be good ok?\" My son was irritable the whole time and I was too.  Waited forever to get a box too. He is usually pretty good at restaurants but it was a very negative vibe for me and I won't return. Spending $15 to judge my toddler kid being a terror is very rude towards a paying customer."}
{"text":"Great place for free wi-fi and mellow ambiance.  Crepes were good too.  The coffee was good, but they gave me a huge latte when I order a cappuccino.  It is surprising how common this is throughout the valley.  Coffee snobs who know what coffee should be like, might prefer Seattle Espresso down the street.  As far as ambiance, Cupz n Crepes wins.  Usually the Eiffel Tower motif seems too trite, but I didn't mind it so much here.  The spread here offered warmth of a woman's touch too.  Although it was far from old-timey, it seemed like a smiling grandmother might come out of the kitchen door with an apron and the smell of fresh apple pie."}
{"text":"Yum! Had a fantastic time here with a large group celebrating a friend's birthday with 9 adults and 9 kids under 5. The food was SO good. I had the avocado, mushroom and pepperjack. So fresh and delicious! They had toys, coloring books and a tv playing a kid show. I hadn't been here in years and now I think I'll be coming in more often!"}
{"text":"The savory crepes are the star here. The staff is not. My main issue with it is that they act a bit put out if you don't know their routine and they were also very distracted the last time I was there, with each other.  I have been there over a dozen times as it has a nice patio area where you can sit with your coffee and crepe and read."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this hidden spot in a quiet shopping center. Almost across the street from the library/Uhaul.  Owner is very informative. More smiling faces and street advertising would help. Has a clean/professional atmosphere. Unsure of free wifi, would be great though. Been looking for a neat coffee place instead of the chain coffee place down the street. Tasty creative food, quality cold brewed coffee. Nice comfy looking chairs in back. A must try!"}
{"text":"The reviews were spot on for this one - solid but not amazing. I tried a server recommended crepe and it was okay. Basic ingredients, tasty but nothing special. The turtle latte I read about was a little subpar compared to the raving reviews ive seen on here about it. The server really nice, but a little slow. Also couldn't break a $20 for me, but understandable. The atmosphere was the best part which is why I bumped up from a 3 star. Unique tables and chairs, newspapers available and positive vibes. Will be back to try some of the sweet crepes."}
{"text":"Great place just to hang out in the morning. The crepes were delicious: the savory and the sweet. I would go again."}
{"text":"I stopped in to get a breakfast. I had not been here before. I had a couple of questions. The lady behind the counter was so rude and short with me that I ended up leaving and went to Sonic instead.  I was treated very well at Sonic. Too bad a rude person behind the counter can ruin an experience and a possible loyal customer."}
{"text":"Didn't know this place existed until this week. Such a cute place. Had the ham and cheese crepe and it was delicious. Their frappes are really good as well. I had a hard time choosing the crepe I wanted to try, as there were so many choices. Will most likely go back"}
{"text":"Yes!  My husband and I frequent here for lunch! We love it, inexpensive and delicious.   The chicken supreme crepe is amazing! For the sweet crepes, I enjoy the simple but tasty sugar and lemon juice. And for coffee lovers, you must get the hot salted caramel latte. Yum!"}
{"text":"We have returned several times and the service time has improved! We like all the entertainment available for our kids too (TV, coloring books, games). My son loves to get just a plain crepe and my daughter is hooked on the nutella. Glad to have this café so close to home!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Fresh. Great service. Beautifully designed and relaxing ambiance. Can't wait to go back and try the sweet crepes."}
{"text":"First of all let me say the coffee and the crepes are very good. But they are very very slow they need to have another waitress on during the busy times this is the only reason I wouldn't return or only get my stuff to go. Good fast efficient service is essential to a successful business"}
{"text":"Ordered the cordon bleu crepe. Not impressed. Was in the mood for a nice farm fresh savory crepe chock-full of vegetables and protein. Unfortunately the only vegetables they seem to have are spinach, onions and tomatoes. Pretty decor and ambiance inside. Good strong cappuccinos."}
{"text":"I love the crepes, the lattes and the staff. Love the Paris ambiance too! I go there regularly for my lattes...they have Pumpkin Spice and Pumpkin Pie Lattes all year round. Great prices. Enjoy supporting local business...rather than a chain coffee shop. One of my new favs..."}
{"text":"Ok so the crepes were good.. service though a bit slow. The Nutella crepes were great with strawberry. The breakfast crepe was a bit dry for me. But I would go back for the Nutella crepe."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Cupz N' Crepes for the last year and absolutely love it. I've come in at various times during their hours. I've come alone to read, to work, and brought friends. The service has always been friendly. It can get crowded on the weekends but it's a small place so it comes with the territory.   I absolutely love The Shirley crepe. Its a crepe filled with cream cheese, Nutella, Strawberries, chocolate sauce and then topped with more chocolate sauce and whipped cream. The strawberries are always fresh and taste amazing. There is a perfect blend of Nutella and Cream Cheese. I have never been a big Nutella fan but something about mixing it with cream cheese makes is heavenly.   I have made my own crepe in which I will usually get chicken, bacon, pesto, lettuce, and cheese. Very good but the sweet crepes have always been more my style.   I've had their blended coffees and iced coffees which really don't taste that much different from any coffee chain place I've been. They do offer Italian sodas which I love (get a raspberry one with whipped creams) it's extremely good.   In all, I really enjoy this place. I would like to come more often on the weekend to be able to work on my side business blogging and running social media. I have never had poor service. Just remember that this a small family run place. They don't have multiple cooks turning out dishes left and right. If it's crowded it may take some time. Just sit back and relax because it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Holy crepe this place is good. I've tried it a few times and every crepe has been nothing short of delicious. It's also really cute with its Parisian theme. I've never really had an especially noteworthy experience here - friendly service, though not always the fastest. Nothing outstandingly amazing, yet also nothing bad. The crepes really are tasty, but they're also don't differ very much from other places that serve crepes. They've got all the basic options - sugar, fruit, and Nutella, as well as savory options like chicken, spinach, cheese, mushrooms, and other meats and veggies. It's always a tough decision of whether to get sweet or savory since both kinds are really good! Though not a super original concept, I do think Cupz N Crepes is worth a try if you're in the area/craving crepes!"}
{"text":"This would be a perfect rating if they had more people on staff, or in the kitchen even.   Every time I've gone in it's been pretty busy and very little people working. After I order, the wait for the food takes forever, so I wouldn't suggest going when you're starving (I learned the hard way). But the food is delicious and I think it's worth the wait... most of the time!  It's a cute place with nice people and great atmosphere. Would recommend anyone in the area to try it out and see what they think of it!"}
{"text":"Been here before and never dissapointed. Great crepes, wonderful coffee.  Service is wonderful. Everyone is so nice, and accommodating. Wish they were open for dinner.   Always crowded."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The service was bearly polite, but the crepes were disappointing all together. I had a bacon egg and cheese crepe, it came to the table naked and a bit dry, the egg and bacon were bearly even there, egg flat and only 2 strips of overcoocked thin bacon. Presentation and flavor went hand in hand- not impressive. I will not be back... Too bad, I love crepes but not this version. I feel this is a bit of an insult to the real art of French Crepe."}
{"text":"3.5* Hungry from a day of shopping, stopped in here with my SILs and niece, about an hour before closing on a Saturday; they frequent this charming Parisienne themed cafe/creperie. Immediately liked the decor, we were invited to sit anywhere to our liking.   My twin SILs went for savory crepes: Turkey Pesto and the Cordon Bleu which are their 'go tos' while the other shared a Nutella & Strawberry with my niece. All three had coffee beverages which are also their tried-and-true options, my niece had almond milk. I chose the Strawberries & Honey crepe requested no whipped cream, and an almond milk chai latte; both were absolutely delicious, I took half my crepe to go: it was loaded with fresh strawberries! Absolutely loved that the chai came in an oversized (think \"Friends\") cup, not cardboard!   Service was cheerful, knowledgeable, and we did not feel rushed at all, even late in the day nearing closing time. Will absolutely return to try more menu items, 'Shirley Gone Bananas' and the Swedish Crepe are on my radar.   * salads available *  ** sweet and savory crepes, reasonable prices  **  *** gets busy during 'prime time, waits are the norm ***  **** very clean restaurant and restrooms! ****"}
{"text":"I didn't realize this was a sit down restaurant when I went in.  My 9 year old and I were meeting friends for lunch at 11 am somewhere else.  We were leaving the allergist and starving at 10 am so wanted a small snack to share.  Tried the breakfast crepe with avocado and feta cheese with mushrooms on the side.  It was good.  Not as fabulous as I had hoped it would be.  My daughter loved the crepe part but decided she wasn't a fan of feta cheese.  I would try it again for sure.  They were super busy and it was cheap.  Less than $6 with tax!"}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely be back. The lattes were a perfect start. The Monte Cristo was so good and my wife had the turkey and cranberry and loved it. Finished with the Nutella and strawberry. I don't think anyone could go wrong with any of the offerings in the menu and a build your own savory makes it even better.   Staff was perfect and so nice to my family. We will be back !!"}
{"text":"Where do I start. I walk in. Not greeted. Waitress yells \"sit anywhere!\"  I sit down. No water.  She finally comes over and drops off a menu and bolts off. No coffee. PS It's National Coffee and only 4 people are in here. She finally comes back and asks me what I want. I tell her a cup of regular coffee and a crepe. She brings it out.  Crepe is tough and lacks flavor hugely. Coffee is barely warm. Since I'm on a tight schedule I don't have time to complain or wait for it to be right.  I did want it to be good!  UPDATE 4/5/2018:  Tried this place again. Why did I do that?  Same review as above."}
{"text":"***DONT WASTE YOUR TIME***  Been here 4 times. First time was great! Good food, expedient service.  The past 3 times have been absolutely miserable. The waitresses look like they don't want to be there and the food takes 30-40 minutes to get out.  I really think there needs to be an honest conversation with the cooks around expectations. We will not be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I was actually very disappointed today. It was my first time showing up so I guess I did have some high hopes. The employees were honestly what really ruined my experience. I wasn't even really seated. Some dude just pointed to a group of tables and it was up to me to pick the right one. I had to wait ten minutes for someone to approach me at my table and give my order and the wait to get the food was long, but I've definitely have had worse so I'm not knocking them for that at all.  I got the crepe with nutella and strawberries and boy the crepe itself was excellent. I feel that the nutella and strawberries were a little too much, but that's not really their fault. They 100% know how to make crepes and that's wonderful.  Really though, I've had bad days at work too, so I can excuse a server for not feeling that well or up for it. The thing is all three different employees that I interacted with made me feel like such a waste of space that I sort of guilt tripped myself into eating as quickly as possible and getting up to pay.  I didn't want to leave a one star review because I don't believe that it's constructive or helpful and it just makes me sound salty. If this kind of behavior is normal for this place, then that's cool too. It's just not for me. I don't know where else I can share about how downtrodden I felt after leaving this spot this morning. I don't want this restaurant to burn or do poorly. I love Ahwatukee and I want the local businesses thrive. I just want to leave a rather helpful reminder that I personally think it's super important for a morning establishment to really do your best and be as nice as you can. A friendly demeanor can really cover up some small mistakes and can only help I think.  Thanks for your time."}
{"text":"Cups is always a win for breakfast or lunch. Prices are good, good is tasty and I like the small location. I wish there was more outside seating when the weather warms up but it's still a great place to go"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place SO bad! I love coffee and I love crepes! It was not meant to be though (...yet). I think if they made a couple changes, they'd be alright. And, I will try them again after a while to see if they've improved. But for now, I'll stay away.  Change 1- The crepes themselves are chewy. Crepes are not supposed to be chewy...at least not that chewy. I've never NEEDED a knife with a crepe before. I've used a knife with a crepe before, but it was absolutely essential here. I'm not a chef, but my guess is too much stirring of the batter creates too much gluten, which means way too chewy crepes (?). I know that's true with pancake batter at least.  Change 2- Without advertising the fact, they used some sort of non-fat or skim milk in their espresso drinks (I ordered an Iced Mocha). I think a little bit of fat (like whole milk) works best in espresso drinks. I would have at least liked the option, but it was not stated anywhere, nor were we asked about type of milk we wanted. Worse yet, they used a cheap brand of milk (or it was expiring?). Bad.  Good points: The fillings of the crepes were actually delicious (otherwise I wouldn't even consider coming back). The turkey, the pesto, the avocado, all delicious! My sis ordered a sweet crepe, and that was also delicious...well, the inside of it anyway. The atmosphere was also nice. I wasn't expecting it to be so 'chic' inside (like I really know what chic is). But, it was both modern & relaxing inside. The service was mostly friendly too...after a rough start.**  Bad Points: Chewy crepes. Low quality milk. **The beginning of our service was weird. I hate when people who work places treat you like you should know how THEY do things even when it's your first time there. You ever pick up on that vibe some place? I didn't even know if you order first or sit first, and they were staring at us like, \"What's your problem?\" Uhh...I don't know what to do; that's my problem! How about welcoming me to your establishment and telling me to have a seat or place my order. They turned into sweethearts after we were seated, but it was a startling introduction.  Bottom line: I will try them again eventually perhaps, but I'm in no rush at this point."}
{"text":"There is nothing here that I don't like. The food is delicious and the staff is great! It's a wonderful mom and pop shop and has a welcoming feel to it. It's a perfect place to become a regular customer. I always enjoy coming in and eating here :)"}
{"text":"The place is usually busy, but has a nice chill/laid back Ahwatukee feel.  They have a big selection of crepes and coffees.  I dig the banana and nutella crepe.  They have much healthier crepe selections if you don't need the sugar+coffee buzzzz."}
{"text":"You can't get a better crepe in town!!! The food here is fantastic! The Cobb salad rivals anyone who has ever made Cobb salad on earth!!! The strawberries and bananas with Nutella is the bomb! Do not miss this place!!!"}
{"text":"This is a weekly place for  us. Same two servers (mother and daughter). This is more of a hang out. Don't go for a Parisian experience dressed in your Sunday best, it's more of a mom and pop shop to hang out and enjoy some quiet time."}
{"text":"Small little shop with a warm and welcoming ambience.  One of my top favorites for brunch for 2015, Pesto chicken and Sherleys Gone Bananas being my family favorites."}
{"text":"I like this place because it's small and the crepes are good. If you're a regular you're most likely going to get good service. If you're not, it's hit or miss. One time I sat and waited to be acknowledged for over 15 while the waitress chatted with everyone around me. I was annoyed but once my friends arrived we got good service. They go there a lot."}
{"text":"The two stars here are for the crepes and coffee. The minus three are for the rude service or lack of attentive service the many times I've been. If you're going to check it out, pick a slow time. Otherwise be prepped for disappointment."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Great staff who remember my order when I come in. They have good coffee and great food. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Crepe-tastic!!!! Cute place with yummy crepes! I had the strawberries and the strawberries with cream cheese.   The strawberries with cream were awesome! It's a great stop that's family friendly and the salted Carmel latte was delicious!"}
{"text":"Many people had said this place was an awesome place to study on their reviews, I pretty much got kicked out so I wouldn't agree. When I walked in it was empty and I had never been there before so I assumed it was more like a coffee house not table service. The girl explained it was table service and I asked if it was alright to study and she said \"it gets pretty busy on the weekends,\" I was already there so I decided I might as well have breakfast.  The crepe was okay, not impressive by any means, I expected it to be warm and it was pretty cold. Then they made a point of letting me know that they had a wait list (even though there was clearly another person studying that was a regular) and brought me my check.  Never asked if I would have liked anything else, I was considering buying an americano (only because the coffee was so weak.)  Fun every once and a while brunch place, but don't go there to study or for the service."}
{"text":"This is the place for crepes if your a crepe person!! They have everything from sweet to savory on their large menu. If your not a crepe person their salads are fresh and delicious as well.  Never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"I found the crepes to hit the spot on a lazy hungover Sunday morning...  I had the bacon, egg and cheese crepe with cheddar cheese. I would have to say it was a bit average, and would have enjoyed maybe some sort of creamy sauce on the inside!   I did find that the service was a bit slow...  I was disappointed to see that their menu only has nutella as a chocolate topping for the dessert crepes.  I HATE nutella and wish they had just regular chocolate as an option as well :("}
{"text":"A cute little cafe with great decor, and serving an assortment of sweet and savory crepes! They also have a reeeally nice women's bathroom! It's a great place to meet with friends or study, but as for the crepes, I've had better. Although they are reasonably priced, the ingredients don't seem that quality. (Maybe I'm spoiled from Crepevine) I ordered a turkey pesto crepe expecting actual turkey but it was just a couple pieces of packaged turkey slices. And though the pesto was tasty, it was clearly a store-bought spread. And the crepe itself was so-so. Guess I'll have to try a sweet crepe next time...  Also, the waitress wasn't that friendly, and the overall customer service wasn't great."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I love this place.  We go here quite often on the weekends.   The crepes are delicious, and they have several sweet, savory and breakfast crepes to choose from.  The coffee is okay, usually pretty strong.  The family that owns the place is really cool and they and like to joke around.  Great place"}
{"text":"Best crepes I have had in the states. I'm boring, I always get the Nutella with Strawberries & Bananas, but it's SO GOOD. Staff is friendly, and the ambiance is nice. They renovated and redid the decor and it looks much nicer. I don't go here as often as I'd like anymore, but when I do get to go it's a special treat for me. I would have given 5 stars, but as they've become more popular, the service has gone downhill a little. Last time I was there it took quite awhile to get my food. I will still keep coming back though. The food is always delicious and the prices are decent."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a better review. The crepes and coffee are good, but the service here is HORRIBLE. Unfortunately, it hasn't been a one-time thing. Most of the times that we've come, we've had to wait at least 10-15 minutes just to get menus and water. Then another 10 mins for coffee... and another 20 mins for crepes.   Today was more of the same. However, after waiting the standard 10 mins for our lattes, the waitress brought the wrong drink because she could read what she had written. One we ordered our crepes, we waited another 35 mins. At that point, the waitress came over and asked if we wanted anything else... forgetting that she hadn't yet brought us our food. When we reminded her, she apologized and, to her credit, brought us a fruit bowl. The crepes came out 5 mins later.  After we ate, she brought us the check for full price. I asked her if we can get anything taken off because of the messed up coffee order and the long wait. She said that was why she gave us the free fruit bowl... but she would do something for us. Then, she came back with the revised bill, taking off one crepe ($5). Instead of arguing, I resigned myself to paying it and posting this review.  Again, I wish this were a one-time thing, but you need to know what you expect when you come here - decent food and terrible service. I also wish that there was a better place to get crepes in the east valley. I guess next time we'll try that place in Tempe."}
{"text":"My yelp friends at work have talked about this place a few times & i keep thinking we need to try it out. My husband woke up this morning & said he wanted to make Blueberry cream cheese crepes. I told him there was this place i wanted to try that made crepes & we should go there instead, and it is worth it to me to go out so I don't have to clean up a huge mess. So we took our dogs and had a great Sunday breakfast. They have a few patio tables outside & the Arizona weather is perfect right now to eat outside! The staff was great & they kept checking to make sure we had everything we needed which is great b/c sometimes when you are outside it can be easy to be ignored. I ordered a vanilla latte & my husband had a plain coffee. My latte was perfect, just sweet enough for me. My husband saw that they did indeed have blueberry cream cheese crepes & ordered one. I went a little more savory and ordered the turkey, avocado & pesto crepe. They were both fantastic. Pesto can be very oily, but this was perfect and really brought everything together in a perfect bite. The blueberry crepes were great too, but I'm glad i didn't have that to myself as it was very sweet & rich. My husband has a huge sweet tooth though & he is a sucker for blueberries so he was in heaven. The staff even brought a bowl of water out for our dogs. Great little spot to meet up for a cup of coffee & a light breakfast! Will definately be back."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and have found my new hangout.  The crew @ Cupz N' Crepes are fantastic and their coffee is to die for!  They offer incredible caffeinated drinks as well as unloaded ones, delicious crepes and an atmosphere that draws you in.  Highly recommended, I usually stop in there 4-5 times a week."}
{"text":"Really good crepes. The service is extremely slow but worth the wait. Make sure when you go it isn't a day where any of the high schools have late start, it gets extremely busy. The restaurant is super cute and good for breakfast or brunch, but they also have lunch crepes so its good for dinner too."}
{"text":"Holy Crepes!  The Turtle Latte was good.  Strawberry honey crepes were nice! Nutella, strawberry banana crepes were tasty... Bacon egg and cheese was good too.  The owner lady was really friendly and this is a pretty nice place... Clean and inviting...  Good Prices! Good Food! Good Service!  Don't miss out, stop in for a bite!"}
{"text":"Really slow service.  Crepes were OKAY.    It's a cute little place and I wanted to like it more.    Once we walked in we had to wait almost 10 minutes to get menus.  We both ordered nutella, banana, and strawberries crepes.  They were good, but nothing special.  It took forever, and luckily we didn't need any refills because nobody asked about it.  Honestly, the crepes tasted like they needed a pinch of salt in the batter.  They weren't awful, but not sure I would go back.  $21 for 2 crepes, a coke, and an iced coffee.  It took almost an hour.  No thanks.  You're better off making some homemade pancakes/waffles and slathering on some nutella and fruit at home."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Excellent crepes both savory and sweet. My favs are Turkey Pesto in the savory category and Shirley in the sweet category.  Plain Lattes are great and there are a variety of flavored lattes on the chalkboard. Chic French decor with a casual atmosphere. Friendly,  efficient staff."}
{"text":"This is my first review, so here I yelp!  A friend of mine recommended this place for crepes, and I needed a quick stop to eat lunch. It looks like they just opened. First of all, I am a crepe fan, and I honestly think they can do better. I came with that expectation because food at restaurants isn't always satisfactory, and I've stopped going out for a long time.  I ordered a Veggie Delight (I'm a vegetarian/vegan), and it had baby spinach, red onion, tomatoes and feta cheese, and it wasn't fully wrapped and there was too much feta cheese. I like a crepe where everything's stuffed in-nothing spilled out on the ends. I liked their simple selection of ingredients-I would have liked to see more vegetarian options. They do have the \"create your own crepe\" option, but I wasn't in the right mood to invent my own crepe. It costs $3.50 for a crepe with 1 topping and for every meat you add, it's 1.00 and savory & cheese for .75. If I really made the effort to design my own crepe, I would have ordered spinach and swiss, and it would have been slightly cheaper than the Veggie Delight (it cost $5.25) for less ingredients.  If I could come here again, I would try the breakfast crepe and sweet crepe when I need my sweet fix. And maybe that'll change my rating. :)  I like the design and decor of the cafe-a nice mixture homey 'n' modern feel to it-loove the wooden fans. Doesn't ave alot of character, but there are several old-french style decor. The open celings with metal covers are cool. It is very spacious, and there are several black plush chairs and lots of tables and chairs. I would come here to study since they have free WIFI here, and you can find comfort here.  I ordered iced chai with soy milk, and it was surprisedly good-most places don't make it right!  Lastly, the customer service is greeeat-as soon as I sat down, a waitress came up to me and asked what I wanted to order-you would think this cafe is a typical one where you go to the bar and take your order, but this is also a restaurant setting where they serve you.  If not for crepes, I'd def recommend this place for a hang-out and a sip of coffee with friends if you want to steer away from the devli's brew for yuppies.  (Starbucks)"}
{"text":"I really go out of my way for this place. The prices has gone up since I've been here the first time but they are still reasonable.   I sort of bashed the turkey crepes in an earlier review but have since tried it. In fact, I've tried everything that had pesto in it. Their pesto is so good.   My top favorite is the Chicken Veggie. After that it is tied between the Turkey Pesto and Chicken Supreme. And seriously, all hail that Sunshine crepe, the parfait disguised crepe."}
{"text":"We've been dining here for years now. We love their crepes! They have both sweet and savory. The ingredients are consistently fresh. Whether meeting here for business, with a friend, family or someone new, this is a good choice for a relaxing cup of coffee, (or for the kids, they have Italian sodas), and a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"The service was very slow and the food was nothing very special. We took some friends who were visiting from out of town and we were hoping for a better experience after reading some of the reviews, but we were disappointed. Our server was nice enough, just very slow."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for the first time this past weekend. The Crepes were excellent and so was the service. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great local place. Variety of coffee and crepe choices, all delicious creations. Family owned, super friendly staff. It's a favorite place of ours!"}
{"text":"Love to grab a late breakfast or lunch here.  I almost always get the turkey/pesto, it's so darned good!   I've been many times over the years, and NEVER had a bad crepe!  Nice atmosphere too.  Seems to be a lot of locals that know each other..."}
{"text":"I love this place.  My all time fave is the sweet crepe that has cream cheese, banana, caramel and whip cream on top, fantastic!  Terri is so sweet too.  I've never been disappointed in any of the crepes I've chosen.  I make a point to bring all out-of-town visitors here & refer customers in my boutique as well!  I'll be a customer forever!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for the first time today. We were greeted immediately which was awesome. There was no wait for us. We sat down and ordered drinks. Their hot chocolate is amazing! The crepes were presented very well and tasted delicious!   Why I gave this place 4 stars: we ordered within 10 minutes of arriving and didn't receive our food until about 45 minutes into our visit here. The server also forgot to bring us waters and we had to ask again, not a huge deal but still. With these notes: there were only, three servers working. Unsure of cook staffing.  Also, we ordered a side of bacon and received bacon that looked as if it was precooked bacon that you would buy, it was very thin and not very good."}
{"text":"The crepes are to die for!!!  I went with my hubby and son and we loved the food.  You will have to wait a bit for your food, but well worth it.  The service was on top of drinks and letting us know that it would take time to make our scrumptous crepes.  I beleive this is a family owned establishment and you can tell that they take pride in the service and wonderful breakfast/lunch.  Gotta check this place out."}
{"text":"Not the friendliest staff on earth.  Staff has that hipster rebel look that is supposed to be cool but really just looks trashy and uninviting. Food= takes forever.  Taste= my crepe will be described as a soggy, burned tortilla without flavor. My fiancé's= he liked it a lot. Overall: not coming back."}
{"text":"I've grown very fond of this place.  I've come here several times over the past six months or so.  The crepes are consistently excellent and reasonably priced.  The crepes themselves are crispier than you usually find, but personally I prefer it to the soft ones.  What others have said about the service is true.  Sometimes it gets slow when the place is packed, and sometimes you get forgotten once your food has been served.  It may be time to hire some additional staff.  However, the owner recognizes the regulars and builds good rapport with them, a serious plus in my mind.  As far as the coffee goes, it's the best place in Ahwatukee if you're a chain-hater like me.  It's priced typically (i.e., too expensive, but about the same as any Starbucks in Arizona) and they have tons of latte options.  I'm definitely a fan.  Recommended:  BLTA, Nutella and bananas, Iced salted caramel latte."}
{"text":"Never had crepes before coming here and I had no idea what I was missing. The food is always fresh, but the downfall is sometimes you have to wait over a half an hour to get your food. Everyone here is really nice and they have a great menu, they close at 4 so a great place for lunch or brunch on the weekends."}
{"text":"The place looked great. Very unique and Paris decorated. But really slow service. Slow...for a crepe. The dough used wasn't very good either. Too thick and doughy, not very sweet. Won't be back to this place."}
{"text":"I decided to bring my family here for brunch... unfortunately I quickly regretted my decision. First, they were not accommodating to food allergies, the customer service was sub-par and our waitress was very unorganized and therefore seemed very flustered. All of this translated to an overall disappointing experience. There are so many other great restaurants in the area and next time I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Some of the poorest customer service I have ever experienced, but the crepes and drinks were very good :)"}
{"text":"We had a in-service training day at work, which means 8 hours of training, but everyone can go to lunch at the same time, so a group of us decided we would head on over to Cups N Crepes. I have wanted a crepe forever!! So off we went!  We were a party of 8, and we had separate checks too, but never did our waitress get flustered with us, I have to say service was good and friendly, our drinks were filled, and we were taking care of, instead of bringing us separate checks we were told we would be rung up at the counter, that was easy for us!  I couldn't make up my mind on if I wanted a savory or sweet crepe, so I went for both haha. I 1st ordered the Shirley, which is cream cheese, nutella (LOVE THAT STUFF), strawberries inside and topped with whipped cream and drizzled with chocolate sauce OMG that was pure heaven! Everything was great and perfect, I wanted more!! I think I could eat that every day for a month and never get tired of it, just so delish! Then I ordered the Turkey Pesto, which was pesto, turkey, cheese, avocado and tomato and yes this was a good savory crepe, but I ruined it by having the Shirley 1st, because at this point all I wanted was another Shirley haha.  The turkey pesto though is a good tasting crepe!    I noticed on the board on the way out that they have one that has chocolate, banana and coconut crepe; I know I am coming back for that, plus I already hear the Shirley calling my name!  See ya soon Cups N Crepes!"}
{"text":"This is definitely THE place to get crepes in town. The variety is vast and the ingredients are fresh!  The crepe is a little bit tough and thick, but I think it might be by design because they pack so much real ingredients in it that it needs to be able to hold them in.  I ordered The Shirley with banana. It is Cream Cheese, Nutella, Strawberries w/ Whip Cream & Chocolate Sauce. I wanted some banana with it to make it even more tasty. It was huge and delicious~ I think it should be considered healthy since I had strawberries and banana... :P  My hubby ordered Graceland (Peanut Butter, Bananas & Honey) and a Bacon Egg & Cheese breakfast crepe. Both were delicious.   Bacon Egg & Cheese was very satisfying for breakfast. Graceland hit the spot for my hubby's peanut butter craving.  We can't wait to head back and try out all the other items on their Savory Crepe menu."}
{"text":"I have been a patron since this business opened. I enjoy the atmosphere, the food, their drinks and especially the teas. Although a coffee drinker, I really enjoy good tea and it is very rare to find a place that has them.  It is a small and family owned business, with consistent employees and it is nice to be recognized and feel valued as a client.  They will accommodate large groups if needed and I would definitely recommend it for a family brunch or breakfast.  Give it a try. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, authentic crepes.  My boyfriend and I had some time to kill and were starving so we stopped in. We were immediately impressed by the decor and homey vibe. The restaurant was busy and the owner was welcoming and patient with us as we explained we had never been there. The crepes were very fair priced and the coffee was delicious. One of the owners came by to talk to us while we were there and he was very nice and happy to be there.   It did take a little while to get our crepes but it was well worth the wait. I ordered banana, strawberry and blueberry with nutella crepes and they were delicious. It felt like I was in Paris again. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good food, great owner, service and ambiance. After being there once, our server remembered our orders - and we didn't return for our second visit for months. I love that we felt like a regulars almost immediately. They know our kids and are always warm, friendly and inviting. If you're looking for a place to feel like you're noticed, this is the place for you. :)  And I highly recommend the strawberries, banana and nutella crepe - yum!!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty decent crepes and the coffee is pretty good as well. I got a crepe with yogurt and berries the first time I came and one with nutella, banana, and coconut the next time. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for crepes and coffee. Went here for the first time today, and we were extremely satisfied. The selection is great and the prices are awesome at under $7 per crepe. We drove an hour to get here today because there are no crepe places near us, and it was worth it. I got the Chicken Supreme crepe with a Shirley for dessert. It was a ton of food, and the Turtle blended coffee was great. I can't wait to come back and try more of their selection."}
{"text":"I met up with a friend yesterday for lattes and crepes. Perfect place for just that! This was my third visit but I hadn't been to CnC in about a year because I keep forgetting it's there!! I definitely won't forget next time I'm craving crepes 'cause they make 'em tasty here! The \"patio\" is just a sidewalk facing a parking lot but when it's nice outside, who cares? Our server was friendly, efficient and non-intrusive (thankfully, as we were definitely NOT in a rush). My latte was prepared exactly as I asked (special instructions that Starbucks often gets wrong somehow) and the servings are just the right size. I can personally recommend the Banana Nutella (just like the ones at Cibo!), the Strawberry Cream Cheese, and the Turkey Pesto. My friend loved her Strawberry, Kiwi with Honey.  Also, very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We ordered for our office from cupz n crepes. Had a fairly large order since it was for the whole office the food was amazing. They got our order correct thank god.The lady that was taking our order via the phone had alright customer service. Food was great and the service was alright."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here on a weekly basis. The crepes are delicious (especially the nutella and banana) and the ingredients are always fresh.  Coffee is good and the staff (that consists of mother, son and daughter) are always friendly and welcoming. Sometimes service takes a while when they are busy but they are worth the wait! We love this place and will continue to go there as long as we live in Arizona. We also voted them the best cafe on bestofphoenix2012.com Good luck Cupz nd Crepes!"}
{"text":"Gave this place another try after my first very successful time. Downgraded to three based on dinosaur like service and one customer who was very offensive to me, stereotyping me based on my look and skin color. Granted he looked like he was 85 and senile but still didn't give him the right to say what he said to me. I left and sat outside on the patio. Didn't have a very good experience."}
{"text":"This was a disappointing experience.  I took my mother in law here for her birthday so it was her first time being here.  Their customer service and service in general really sucked.   Everyone who works there looks as though they dont want to be there, they are critically under-staffed for being busy on a Saturday and they make you stand and wait ages before anyone acknowledges you!  We waited so long to be served that i decided that maybe one is supposed to go up to the counter to put in the order.  The untidy girl behind the counter said to me that sg2e would come and take my order but they were \"just busy right now!\"  Couldnt believe what i heard!  Firstly, do you want the business or not?  Secondly,  maybe you should hire more people!!!! You dont tell a paying customer that you are too busy to serve them!  The crepes were forgettable and i had hoped they would make up for the bad service.  They looked nice but were really very underwhelming.  My caramel latte tasted like dish water so i feel like comibg gere for a special occasion was not the best idea.  It made sense though...if your \"too busy\" to give good service then it goes without saying that yr quality control goes out of the window because your \"too busy\"!  Sorry...not impressed !"}
{"text":"I was in the area and was looking for a new spot for breakfast. Great crepes! Soooo delicious. I had the mushroom, avocado, cheese crepe with Colby jack cheese. I can't wait to go back and try the desert crepe strawberries and cream. Good friendly fast service. I will be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I road out bikes here! The crepe was the perfect size and it hit the spot! I had the sunshine crepe with vanilla yogurt and no whipped cream! It was perfect, and not too sweet!! An absolutely lovely place to enjoy some of the finest French crepes!"}
{"text":"Everything was very good. We had the 'Shirley Gone Bananas' and the 'Chicken Veggie' both of which were gone within 10 minutes. I've never actually had a crêpe before, so this was my first time, and I'm definitely sold. The service was very good, and our waitresses were very kind and friendly.  Will definitely be coming back when I get the chance."}
{"text":"Crepes are okay.. Batter is a little thick. I got the lingonberries and sweet cream. A little bit too much jam. Coffee is okay. Nothing special. Place is located in a random strip mall... Don't think I'll come back here."}
{"text":"I love their coffee ! They have amazing huge portion coffees and lattes ! Portion just like in France :)   It's flavorful strong and their white chocolate will make it yummy sweet but not over sweet treat :)  My family loves the crepe here , it's a little too thick for my liking but it's still a great little cafe :).     Friendly stuff ! Awesome place, crepe is good it's just my preference is thinner softer crepe."}
{"text":"The best crepes, cute atmosphere, really good coffee (try the nutella latte) & friendly service! Great WIFI!"}
{"text":"The staff here act put out whenever a customer walks through the door. The crepes were pretty good so I put up with the treatment for about five visits.  It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I go here regularly, and it is my go-to choice for breakfast/brunch. I always get the same order, and they always remember it, too. My fiancé's son is a picky eater, but he will eat here too. The staff is very nice, the food is reasonably priced, and most importantly it is delicious! The atmosphere is also great, as it is well decorated."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out and their extensive menu definitely kept my attention. I ordered a latte, a water, and a Shirley crepe. The latte was okay- nothing special, I probably could've bought the same taste at Starbucks. Not to mention it took about 15 minutes to get my latte AND my water. The crepes took about another 40 minutes to come out, but mine was very delicious and I was full after I ate just half of it. Our server never came to check on us and it seemed like she was avoiding us by the time we wanted our check. Probably wouldn't come back to this place, the good crepe isn't really worth the bad service."}
{"text":"Very delicious crepes. I do wish the staff smiled a bit more. Food is worth coming back though. Worth 4 stars def"}
{"text":"Charming little cafe with a unique and delicious menu item- crepes. I love the sweet crepes and I always order the stawberry with nutella crepe. The coffees are delicious too. I have been here about 6 times recently and while the staff are very friendly, it seems they are always short 1-2 people during the mornings and weekends. Typical wait time for me when I dine alone is about 30-40 minutes. Just be prepared for that, enjoy a coffee and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious! The only downer is the price relative to the size of your meal. Too little food for what you pay."}
{"text":"Not the best crepes I've ever had--but not the worst either.  Their service made the two times I've eaten here some of the worst dining experiences of my life.  My wife and I wasted 2+ hours on both occasions because of how poorly this operation is run.  Waitress covered in tattoos from head to toe--thought she was part of a prison work-release program, but I guess she is the owners' daughter?  At least 30 minutes after being seated for her to even show up to the table.  Spent the next 30 minutes attempting to get silverware, water, and coffee--actually went and refilled my own water glass twice to avoid the wait.  An hour after ordering, the food arrives, which made sense when I saw that the henpecked husband/owner was the only one cooking on a jam-packed Sunday morning.  His head was bowed like a dog awaiting a beating from the wife/owner who is a truly nasty, arrogant person.  I could not believe her snarky comments--actually shocked me into silence.  Whenever one of her \"buddies\" arrived, nasty woman rushed right to their table, set it, and catered to their every need, ignoring all other patrons.  So maybe it is her intent to chase away those who are not in the \"inner circle?\"  Prices were a bit on the ridiculous side, all things considered, and I'm not going back in an effort to sycophant my way into the \"inner circle.\"  Lady, I hope your \"pals\" continue to keep your doors open because, if they don't, I seriously doubt you can maintain a viable enterprise--the food wasn't so spectacular that anyone outside the \"circle\" would willingly ignore the crap you displayed."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying I have been coming here for a while and the crepes are pretty delicious which is why they are even getting 2 stars.  Service has never been fabulous but not worth complaining about until it went out-of-bounds bad today. Today, a friend and I sat and waited literally 30 minutes before anyone would even bring us water.  This was after my friend had to get up and ask someone at the counter to please come serve us.  Even after that, there was an uncomfortable time lapse before we even got the water!  Then, when the waitress finally came over for our order, my friend politely informed her how long we had waited to even be acknowledged and we were only rewarded with intense attitude/denial and no apology!  One apology if she hadn't seen us or felt overwhelmed would have gone a long way - I get it, but nothing.  We watched her serve all of the other tables food (most of which had arrived after us) before we even had some water!  It was so bad that I started to wonder if the waitress could possibly have something personally against us that I was completely unaware of but that's crazy, right?? So, no validation, no apology, no comp on the bill, no vindication, (except perhaps this review) just a fear that there was waitress spit in my crepe or water...  Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"I love this place! I came for breakfast by myself & it instantly became a favorite. I try to come each weekend that I'm home. First off It's a very relaxed atmosphere and the customer service is great! They offer breakfast, lunch & dessert crepes & they are Delicious!! My usuals are either the Nutella Crepe-YUM or the savory Chicken Supreme-Soo Freaking Good! If you're looking for a chill atmosphere to enjoy some amazing crepes, then Cupz N' Crepes is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Geeat food but it took 15 minutes for them to realize i didnt get my order taken. Took additional 45 minutes to get my crepe. It was not too busy either, they literally have 1 chef"}
{"text":"The food is good.  It's a nice breakfast spot and I'll probably end up eating here a lot.  The savory crepes are better than the sweet (in my opinion) and the coffee drinks are tasty.    There are a few things I'd like to see change though:    - A hostess would be welcome.  Being my first time here I walked in and was unsure of what to do.  There's a register and a long counter so there was no clear indicator as to whether it was counter service or table service.  I had to track down an employee to find out.   - The service is spotty.  There were two waitresses working when I was there.  Every table was full so it was 15 minutes before we got to order.   - The wait times for food.  After ordering it was 20-25 minutes for two crepes.  That's way too much.  I didn't mind as I wasn't in a hurry but it made me sure to never come here if you have anywhere to be in the next 90 minutes.    I like crepes and  I like coffee and I like good service.  Two out of three ain't bad."}
{"text":"Satisfied my sweet and savory liking in a single swath.  Just had my first visit here and will be back soon.  The crepes were tasty and light, the service was attentive and friendly.  Too bad they aren't open later for a sociable evening with dessert and caffeine."}
{"text":"Shhh...it's a secret!  I love this place.  Looking for some tasty crepes and a large latte, this place is a MUST go! My fiance and I visit this local establishment, hidden in a small strip mall every other Saturday.  The menu has plenty of choices of sweet and savory crepes, we get one of each.  We recommend the Strawberry & Nutella and the spinach with ricotta cheese.  They also serve several coffee beverages from peppermint lattes to iced mochas.  We'll keep going back as it's one of our favorites."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for Cupz N' Crepes to open and it was worth the wait.  Their crepes are delicious!  Try the turkey pesto for lunch and for dessert the almond and honey.  The owner is gracious, the staff is delightful, the ambiance cozy, and the wifi works!!!!  Thank you for bringing a little taste of Paris to Ahwatukee!  A must try!!!  NatalieG."}
{"text":"best service ever!!!!! love their food and the people that work there are the greatest people ever! i love it and go in all the time:)"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous breakfast/brunch place.  Have been coming here for years and have never had a negative experience.  I always get the same wonderful crepe: peanut butter, nutella, and banana. The lattes are wonderful too.  Cute French decor, French music playing- great vibe."}
{"text":"Nice for breakfast, when there is no wait.  They have gotten my order wrong on more than one occasion (do they have to put mayonnaise on EVERYTHING?) but there is good coffee and fresh food."}
{"text":"Went here last week for breakfast. Although the wait was long, it was worth it because it was very busy. Clean and cute decor. Feels like I'm in Paris eating crepes:) I ordered choose your own crepe (which you can add anything you wanted into your crepe)   and my boyfriend ordered the chicken crepes.  They flavors were  fresh and tasty! We both also ordered two sweet crepes strawberries, bananas, and NUTELLA! I think our eyes were too big for our stomachs.  We were both full from our first order and took the rest Togo."}
{"text":"I love crepes and the fact that this location is so convenient for me is wonderful. As you walk in there is a cute atmosphere that invokes a sense of comfort. The wait staff is quite nice but sometimes it is very busy and they forget to bring the water or take a while. I have often come at different times just to make sure it wasn't due to the crowding but the service is still subpar. I suppose they want to imitate the slow pace of paris.  Each crepe is crafted with care as all of them look fabulous and the taste is just splendid. The crepe itself is not a crispy texture like some places but a stretchy doughy consistency that I am quite fond of. The savory crepes are similar to each other except for the turkey pesto and italian. Turkey pesto is unforgivingly salty but the others seem true to their description. The sweet crepes are a delight and they have a good variety whether you are craving a lighter fruit crepe or chocolate drenched or a mix there is one for you. I enjoy the strawberry, kiwi and honey as well as the sunshine. One crepe rarely fills me though so the bill ends up being expensive since I get one of each. Coffee and italian soda here are also quite good but I wouldn't say it is to die for. All in all it is a wonderful place to sit and relax for a bit as well as enjoy a delicious warm doughy crepe."}
{"text":"We have been going here for lunch about once a month for the past several months. Always high quality, always fresh, and always friendly. Support your local shops and forget about Starbucks. This place lives to give you a touch of France, a touch of Italy, and honestly, who doesn't like Nutella."}
{"text":"Is not closed..... Monday through Friday 7:00.  3:00 Weekends from 8 to 3 They just went on vacation.."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here many times for breakfast and once for lunch. Their chai latte is delicious and I don't even care for tea.  I normally order a savory crepe with egg, cheese, bacon, avocado and mushroom, but I have also experimented and done my own variations. The one time I came here for lunch, I tried the turkey pesto and it was good, but I'd opt for breakfast over lunch any day. The sweet crepes are really good as well; the Shirley is rich and decadent. Anything with Nutella wins in my book. The ingredients always seem fresh and proportionate.  The service can be slow, but the quality of food is worth the wait especially given that it's a non-chain restaurant.  And the people who work there have always been friendly even when it seemed they were overwhelmed. I definitely recommend coming here if you love crepes and a relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"So many tasty options make it hard to choose, but hard to go wrong! One crepe is enough for an average person without overdoing it. Nice change from typical breakfast food!"}
{"text":"You now how you want something and when you don't get it and try something else, it pales by comparison? Yeah. That's this place for me. My favorite place is closed for remodeling. So we tried it here. Every sweet crepe had a \"base\"-- most of them cream cheese. Why? To keep the fruit from getting warm. Um, ok. But I like it a different way, so I asked for a plain one with fruit on the side ($3.25). Bowl was plentiful and fruit mostly ripe. Crepe was, well, not what I expected. It was almost crispy--not what I'm used to, I guess.  Tasted a little doughy but with enough Carmel sauce l, most things are much better. Coffee was ok, too; cups were large and hot. Good sign.  Overall, this place is fine. Nothing over the moon but, in light of many of my other dining experiences, not awful either. I'd recommend waking in without expectation and enjoy the ride."}
{"text":"Good crepes, fast and friendly service. We tried a crepe from the sweet and from the savory side: chicken supreme crepe and nutella crepe. A great place to get your crepe fix regardless of what you're in the mood for."}
{"text":"This place is so friendly. We have been coming here for a while & they remember our regular orders. Great atmosphere. Just chill."}
{"text":"Delicious, eaten here several times and everything I've tried has been delicious. The crepes are quickly made and the coffee is great!"}
{"text":"Wait time to be seated: 10-15 minutes Confusion and frustration when your wait list spot is crossed off and two other parties take tables before you: palpable  Wait time for server: 15-20 minutes Wait time for food: 35 minutes (took it to go since we were on a timeline)  Ham, egg, and cheese crepe: even if it's the best crepe I've ever had, it's not worth the hour and change it took to put it in front of me.   Note: we weren't the only clearly frustrated table. Pretty sure the volume of customers is due to the fact that this is the only game in town. If you plan to visit, just be aware that they are woefully understaffed for the weekend breakfast/brunch crowd."}
{"text":"Pros:  -Cute Parisian themed decor  -Crepes tasted pretty good   Cons:  -Small portions -Dirty silverware  -Poor customer service   I asked the waitress for a new knife, because mine had food stuck to it, and she seemed incredibly put-out, as if I had just asked for her first born. She also forgot my water, which I found strange, since we were one of only two or three parties in the entire restaurant. The crepes were pretty good, but pretty small.   I prefer Jobot in downtown Phoenix for crepes."}
{"text":"This is my spot to be at! I love coming here, staff is friendly, place is clean, i love the Paris theme, and the crepes are sooo good! Nutella w/ strawberries & bananas is my go-to"}
{"text":"My husband started going to this restaurant over 4 years ago and I have been going for over 3 years. It is family owned and they always remember us, no matter how long it is between visits. It is so awesome to walk into a place and see faces that you remember. They are very attentive and service is quick!   They have a huge variety of crepes from sweet to savory. The Italian sodas are amazing and their hot chocolate is so fancy!   I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I have come here twice; once with my dad on father's day and this morning with my boyfriend. Both times everything was really delicious. Both times I've gotten the Shirley's Gone Bananas. A crepe with nutella, strawberries, bananas and whipped topping. MmmmmMm! If you go on Saturday or Sunday morning be prepared to wait because it gets pretty busy and it's a small cafe. The staff are friendly and the place is clean. The only thing I wish they had are side orders of eggs, bacon or sausage and potatoes for the breakfast crepes and chips or fries for the lunch crepes.  The crepes are an ok size but if you're wanting a big hearty meal this isn't it. At least they don't over charge, their prices match what you get, so that's good! If we're ever in the mood for crepes this is where we'll go!"}
{"text":"Poor service. We waited 30 minutes for our food and we had not one, not two, but three different servers.  We live around the corner and were hoping for a delicious new breakfast place to come to on the weekends and left very disappointed.  Food was decent, service so poor I don't plan on ever going back."}
{"text":"This place is ADORABLE!! I was getting my teeth cleaned next door one day and afterward decided to give this place a try. It did not disappoint!!! The woman who was serving seemed like she might be the owner and the service was excellent! I ordered the Italian Crepe and it was delicious! I'll be back to order a sweet crepe sometime very soon. Great place!!!"}
{"text":"I think I'd like to give them like a 3.5 really. We talked about going there for quite awhile since it's just around the corner from where we live. Finally, last Saturday, after an early jaunt to the dog park, the boy and I decided to have a nice little brunch date. The place was fairly empty and we were surprised to find it was full table service. We were prepared to order at the counter and then sit. The decor was really cute and the atmosphere was really nice. The waitress was a little bit abrasive, and not my favorite, but we ordered lattes and a couple of sweet crepes, read the Ahwatukee Foothills News and just enjoyed some pleasant conversation. We both went with sweet crepes, the Strawberry, Nutella and Whipped Cream. I've never been to France and I've not traveled the world over so I'm not going to tell you about how inferior their crepes are to those I've enjoyed in Paris, so I think they were good. I guess they're a little on the thick side, from what I've heard about crepes, but it created a good balance with how much filling they put in them. This past Saturday we had friends stay over and they wanted to go as well, so we went again for the second Saturday in a row. This week there was apparently some sort of Senior Olympics, so 90% of the tables were pushed together for them, fine whatever. So we were sat and brought menus, and not two seconds after the first waitress walked away, the same woman as the last time came over and said \"are you ready to order?\". I felt kind of rude but she was so I guess no harm, no foul, but I just said \"She literally JUST brought us the menus\". So she went away for 30 seconds and was back. Then we ordered coffee, 1 min later she was back with the coffee and very clearly ready for our order. We were half way through giving our order when this group of 3 other diners who were apparently regulars and favorites of the waitress felt that they should interject and begin joking about the waitress not already knowing their order, she of course obliged, and eventually returned to taking our order. We ordered a breakfast crepe each and then two sweet crepes to share. She informed us that she was just going to bring them all out together because that other large group was going to be ordering too. It was obvious what they were trying to do was squeeze us in really quick before the large group of senior bicyclists weeded their kitchen for 20 mins. That's cool, I get it, but it could have been done a bit more gracefully. I had the Ham, Egg and Pepper Jack cheese crepe, which was really good. The ham seemed to be really good quality. One saving grace of the waitress was that she had the forethought to put the whipped cream on the side of the sweet crepes so that it wasn't a melted mess by the time we were ready to eat them. Everything was tasty yet again, but I still think their service could use some work, or maybe I just need to work on being \"a chosen one\". We'll probably go back once in a while, we'll just try to avoid senior bike race day from now on. (Nothing against senior bicyclists of course)"}
{"text":"I love crepes, and as such, I really wanted to try this place out. So, I convinced my wife to go with me for lunch. She's been before and she warned me about the service, but I figured it was just a fluke and it would be fine. Suffice it to say, we came in at lunch time, around 11 and the place wasn't even that busy. Maybe 15 people. The sign said to seat ourselves, so we did, and there we sat unacknowledged for a good 10min. Not even so much as a \"hello\", or a \"we'll be right with you\". I think I even saw one of the waiters sitting down watching the tv. I even saw customers getting up to refill their own waters and get napkins for themselves from waiter station. So, we left (without anyone evening noticing), and we will not be returning.   I'm the kind of guy that likes to recommend places to his friends, and I will not be recommending this establishment. This is how you lose customers, so take note."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, any business I come across is usually pitted against a SoCal equivalent. Why is that you ask? Because SoCal sets the standard. This may be an unfair advantage but I'd like to think, I've come across the best or at least above average places that I'd like to see duplicated out here.   I recently visited this cafe for lunch. The menu online was not as diverse as I'd hope. But the fact that a crepes cafe exists in the East Valley was enough for me to trek out to Ahwatukee for the afternoon. I didn't know what to expect from Ahwatukee since I never go out in that direction. It didn't have the same flavor of La Creperie in Long Beach but that is downtown Long Beach and it's where diversity lives and breathes. Tucked away in a strip mall, this little cafe stood out among the other stores/restaurants with it's signage and decor. It was a friendly cafe that seemed inviting for a casual meal and laid back ambiance.   I ordered the veggie delight and I tried with all my might to really like it. There was nothing special about it. It was dry from the spinach to the tomato down to the cheese. Absolutely dry. No sauce or flavor. My friend also ordered off the \"savory lunch menu\" and felt her meal was bland as well. We wanted to like it but it just wasn't what we had in mind.   I gave the cafe 3 stars because the owner was very patient with us as we took our time ordering. The chai was good not stellar but good. And overall the experience was fine. I just hope that they put the \"savory\" aspect back in the meals by adding a little sauce or flavor to the dishes. This place has great potential and it would be ashamed to see the only local crepes place disappear like most businesses in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Definitely my fave breakfast place! Small, cozey and friendly faces. Prices are affordable and the portions are big! Delicious every single time! :) two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Ordered a turkey pesto crepe and peach black iced tea to go (because I had just finished a long hike in the heat). I was starving and wolfed the crepe down after smelling its delicious aroma in the car all the way home. For under $7, I consider the crepe to be a bargain, it was fairly large with half an avocado inside. The selection of both sweet and savory crepes is quite impressive. Both breakfast and lunch varieties are available during open hours which is nice because I arrived at 10:30am but wanted a lunch crepe.  I will be back for a sweet crepe that is for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday brunch. Just tried it out this past Sunday for the first time. I got a veggie and cheese crepe. Super yummy! My fiancé got the BLTA crepe which was delicious! And be also got the banana Nutella crepe. It was pretty good! I'll definitely be back for more. Wasn't too impressed with the iced coffee. I'll have to keep experimenting I guess!"}
{"text":"Really decent price for crepes, lots of variety and its a nice clean quiet atmosphere .  Also have big variety of coffee drinks.  Staff was friendly and courteous.  They also have a variety of jams for sale. Was there for breakfast but will be back for lunch."}
{"text":"Pretty much exactly what the name suggests. They have coffee, Tea, Crepes and Bagels. However the variety of crepes they offer is incredible. They run the gambit of everything you could possibly think to put in a crepe and a few things that I didn't even think of. I would check them out though they can get a bit busy at times."}
{"text":"Great crepe place! They have a the classic favorites (like mine!)- strawberry, banana, nutella and whip at a fantastic price. They also have savory crepes when you want a meal and a dessert. It seems like they are pretty busy on the weekends for breakfast and brunch so get there early or you'll have to wait in line. The only downside is the when you start scarfing down the deliciousness, the crepe doesn't always remain so pretty."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite places to eat! They have great tea and coffee and delicious food. I have yet to have a crepe I didn't like here. The place itself is warm and welcoming and has a great atmosphere. I recommend the turkey pesto- its one of my favorite savory, and split dessert, any sweet crepe i have tried here has been a winner, even something as  simple as powdered sugar and lemon juice. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing capes, super cute place, love it! Definitely coming again and again!"}
{"text":"This place is great! It is cozy and the espresso drinks are wayyy better than \"fast-food-coffee\". I have been here three times. The first time, I had the pesto chicken crepe. It was so so yummy. I can't wait to go back for lunch and try it again.   This place is turning into our favorite breakfast spot on the weekends. My daughter loves the nutella crepe, and I'm a fan of nutella + strawberries. My husband ordered a savory breakfast crepe with tomatoes, mushrooms and cheese. All three were wonderful.  I only gave four stars because my favorite crepe place ever is still better...that's Ti-Couz crepes in SFO. This place is really really good, but I didn't ooh and ahh after my first bite. I guess I left my crepe heart in SFO."}
{"text":"I adore this breakfast/brunch place. Every time i have out of town guests or a day to meet up with friends this is my first pick. Every time I go there I am happy with the level of service, friendliness of the staff  and quality of the astounding crepes. I would recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"I had read that service could be a bit slow - happens when every thing is made wonderfully fresh to order!   Despite this and only having one hour before an airport run, we could not resist. When we walked in I mentioned we had an hour and asked if we would be OK. The owner said if we were quick to order we'd be fine!  Quick to order....was a tough ask with so many incredible savory and sweet options, not to mention the BYO! We rose to the challenge and built our own savory (they charged it according to the least expensive ingredients????) and ordered the banana, cream cheese, caramel sweet.  While we were battling the menu options the owner made sure to let her staff know we were pushed for time and they were on it.  The crepes were perfect - chewy and moist and slightly crisp on the edges. Very generous fillings and the pumpkin spice latte was 'the best' DH  I wish we had longer than an hour but as we were leaving within our 60 minute window a line was growing at the door.  Friendly staff, lovely decor, hard working owners, welcoming regulars, great attention to detail and an all around gem of a place.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've gone to Cupz n Crepes for many years! The food is always delicious.  They have a good variety of sweet and savory crepes. They have yummy coffee drinks. however the service can be slow. It's not a problem if you aren't in a rush!"}
{"text":"Based on food by itself, I would have only given a two.  I don't think crepes (and I am by no means an expert crepe eater) should be tough. I don't think they should need to be sawed through with a serrated knife. Each of the three times I visited for breakfast this was the case. The fillings might have been savory and delicious, but the wrapper should have had BF Goodrich stamped on it.  So it gets a three for three reasons:  The coffee is great. The atmosphere is open, airy and comfortable. The wifi is strong  Oh, and they have daily newspapers there as well. As much as I am wedded to my electronics, I love to look at newsprint in the morning with my cup of coffee.  So my A-OK is for the coffee and the atmosphere. Try something other than crepes if you're hungry."}
{"text":"First visit here,  definitely not my last! Delicioso! Enjoyed a salted caramel latte and the sunshine crepe."}
{"text":"With the right equipment and enough sweat equity, I know I can make crepes like how they make it here, but why bother? This place is convenient, decently priced, enough menu choices to pick from, and it's just such a treat to lazily enjoy a weekend brunch here. The crepes are always soft and perfectly warm, and they don't really skimp on the ingredients they shove in those delicate little things. So beware that when you order a crepe with more than 5 items in it, you may have to upgrade your fork to a shovel. And their coffee drinks aren't half bad either."}
{"text":"This place is right by my house and I've always passed by it and once I got the chance to go in I will not be coming back to this place. The waitress was so rude and the crepes were kind of pricey. The waitress would hardly come to our table and ask us if we needed anything. My friend arrived a bit before me and she asked if she could put two tables together and a waiter was so bothered by the fact that she asked if she could get the two tables together and after a few minutes the waiter asked my friend \"is your friend coming?\" so rudely. It took forever to get our food. I was just so disappointed."}
{"text":"We ordered the 1. bacon, egg and cheese crepe 2. Strawberries and honey crepe 3. Strawberries/bananas with nutella crepe and the Turtle iced latte.  Our server was really nice, she seemed like the owner along with her husband that made the food. Great food for a good price! If you love sweets then this is a place for you."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! We got the Shirley and a parfait, my sister ordered a hot chocolate and I just had a plain coffee. I'm very particular about my coffee so it was nice to have a good cup of coffee. The service on the other hand was terrible, the waitress was not very happy and made the visit a bit uncomfortable. Other than that, I would definitely go again because of the food."}
{"text":"Food was OK, had breakfast in a crepe, and my wife had the tomato cheese crepe.   Small portions,  but ok in taste,  nothing spectacular,  what gives this place a two star really the service!  Terrible service,  sat at a table, no server, went up to desk and got our own menus,  and still no waitress, waited about ten minutes for her to come by, and finally placed an order. Iced coffee was bitter and had to wait to get cream,  again the service was an attitude of indifference,  and two word answers.  The whole restaurant had about 5 other people, we were just put off, and certainly won't go back.  At a recent dinner party,  we laughed at our misfortune with our friends,  and found out weren't the only ones being snubbed and treated poorly,  so at least the server is consistent."}
{"text":"The only reason this place is getting 2 stars is because their food is amazing, which is a big deal, of course! Delicious crepes & coffee.   However, that being said, the service is horrible! Every time we've been here, it's been bad and getting worse. The owner is downright rude. No smile, no sense of urgency, no \"compassion\". Today there was a party of 22 that came in after us. Overwhelming and noisy? Sure, but not a huge deal. The owner and waitress were asking other guests that were coming in if they had patience to stay because there's a 22 crepe order ahead of them and said that they have a table right there (by the door) where they could sit to be as far from the party as possible. RUDE! You don't say this!!!   Don't go here if you don't have extra time. Food and service takes a long long time! After they finally take your order, they won't come back again. That, coupled with the rudeness makes me not want to go back but again....the food is delicious. That's the only thing saving this place!"}
{"text":"I LIVE for this place haha I like to bring everyone here because of how cute it is!! Also the food is delicious! The prices rock too! Overall, Cupz and Crepes is one of my favorite little breakfast places in Ahwatukee. It makes me feel like I'm in a French cafe or something."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times now. After my last visit I thought I'll give it another chance. However, I have only found that each time the service had gotten worse & worse. I went or with my co-workers on Sat. Yes it was busy. We expected that. When we found a table the waitress wad clearing the dishes off. She left the wet rag to wipe the table down on the table. Shoo I wiped it clean thinking that it would be helpful. It took another 10 min for another waitress too come over & give us menus. No greeting or anything. I handed her the wet rag & said I hope it was alright I just already wiped the table down. She took it & SAID NOTHING!  WE WAITED ANOTHER 20 MIN. & we finally waved her down to ask her if she could take our order. She did & then made a remark about is having patience. This was after waiting over a 1/2 hr. Them others that came in after us were being served. It took another 1/2 hr to serve our crepes. When I got mine it was the wrong crepe & I explained to her I didn't order tomatoes in my crepe it was avocado. She mumbled under her breath she was sure it was tomatoes. We had 5 mins to eat before we had to leave for a meeting at work. All of that to say I will not be going back again. The wait staff has become ruder with each visit."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this place on Sunday, 10/26. We saw it while driving in the area and were looking for a place to eat breakfast.  First impression of the service was not good. The sign said \"Please Seat Yourself,\" but we were asked to wait. Fine. Two women came in after us and were clearly regulars. We stood there for about 10 minutes before we were seated. The women who came in after us were acknowledged and told to pick a table and we were asked to pick the table they didn't pick. Hmmm, really?? We came in first and they knew that.  The food was \"alright.\" Nothing great. Overall, the service was horrible and the food was mediocre. You would think they would welcome new customers (especially local businesses), but apparently they don't need or want any. If the food had been phenomenal, I could look past the service, but that was not the case. I am sure they will do fine without my business, but I can't help but share my opinion with the social media world. Needless to say, there's no need to go back.  One more thing:  They have the word avocado spelled incorrectly in multiple locations on the menu. This does not look professional at all."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  It ways seems busy. Prices seem reasonable.   There's only one guy making the crepes and he is not fast. They need another machine or two.  What I believe is his wife, acts as the greeter and cashier. She's a but surly. I made a comment about it to the young guy there and he said, yeah that's how my mom is. Maybe it was a bad day, or the umpteenth day in a row of working long shifts. I'm going to give it another try for sure. It's not like she's the Soup Nazi or anything but their crepes might be better than his soup!"}
{"text":"simple, by the book crepes... not much of a crepe eater but enjoyed cupz n crepes.  i especially enjoyed the yogi green tea they serve in copious mugs. my spinach and tomato crepe was nicely prepared - the spinach still bright in color and the tomatoes, fresh and not mushy.  i like the cafe feel of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place. Very quaint and relaxed. The staff is very friendly and hospitable. My go to is the turkey and spinach. If you have banked some of you calories for the week go for the strawberries and Nutella."}
{"text":"Definitely a spot that is not worth spending your Saturday morning at. The service was on the VERY  poor side. Coffee came out cold and no check up to verify that everything was okay with our coffee drinks. The Ham, Egg and Cheese crepe was 5/10. The Coconut, Banana, Chocolate crepe was 1/10, which was a total disappointment. We found two separate hairs in our food. The chef was not wearing a hair net, as he can be seen from the tables. I also suggest that this joint stop using cheap tasting chocolate syrup for the chocolate in their sweet crepes. At least melt some chocolate chips, come on. Definitely choosing Crepe Bar over this place any day, all day. Thumbs double down."}
{"text":"This is a perfect place to have a brunch or lunch. the crepes are outstanding. Mostly a place for women to enjoy a late breakfast or lunch. Variety is good and everything is always fresh and clean."}
{"text":"The wait staff is horrible. Waited 5 minutes before I was even acknowledged. When I chose to sit outside ( the only place there was an available table), I sat for another 10 minutes before anyone came to my table, and that was only because they saw me get up to leave. Very disappointed. I was really looking forward to trying this place."}
{"text":"Good cup of coffee and a good crepe = what I was craving this morning.   It's the only creperie in PHX I've tried, so I can't compare to any other place. But it was delicious!  I ordered the Nutella & Banana crepe - only $4.50, complete w some chocolate sauce and just enough whipped cream. Mmmmm.   I totally forgot that they may have WiFi here - doh! And they do... apparently good WiFi, so I'm bummed I forgot my iPad. But it was alright, they had plenty of magazines, newspapers, and books to browse through. I chose a People magazine to get my \"Royal Wedding\" fix.   But the crepe was served faster than I could read/skim through the magazine.... (good thing!)  Service was friendly, efficient.   Ambiance was cozy. They have some table & chairs outside, and plenty inside. They even have a couple sofas in the back w/ a TV -- a couple kids were hanging back their while I'm pretty sure their \"Realtor Mom\" was hanging w/ a few other realtors.   Others have noted that the crepe itself was thick - - i didn't seem to really notice if it was thick, if anything mine was probably on the thin side - just right.   They do have plenty of crepes on the menu: breakfast, savory, and sweet. So plenty to choose from.   This would be a great place to meet up w/ a colleague for coffee time. (and crepes)"}
{"text":"Tastes exactly how you would expect crepes in Ahwatukee to taste, unfortunately. So bland, suburban, and boring. The service was fine and the crepe itself was actually quite nice but the options for filling were incredibly lame. I got \"turkey pesto\" which was literally deli counter turkey shoved into a crepe with what tasted like Bertolli pesto. They also seem to put romaine lettuce and tomatoes in most of their crepes which for me just ruins the texture and warmth of the dish. I would save $10 and make yourself a turkey sandwich at home."}
{"text":"The food, delicious! They do an awesome job with the combinations and the crepe itself, Amazing. Sweet and savory I like both of their options. I've been here several times now and I'll have to say I've never had great service. Today was definitely the worst. I didn't feel welcomed and it certainly didn't make me feel like I should go back anytime soon. I like crepes and I wouldn't say that I seek them out. What makes the difference for me as a customer beyond the good food is great service. I'll come back all the time and be a really loyal customer when the atmosphere is warm. Today I felt more like it was an inconvenience for us to be eating and getting waited on. I was there for 2 hours and wanted to order more food but the server only came to the table twice (to take the order and to deliver the food). I wanted more water and my cup was empty for at least an hour and a half. So I can't say that I'll be going to this place anytime soon for a dine in. If you're big on service I'd say be cautious going here or order to go if you absolutely look crepes because although the food is good the service is not."}
{"text":"I'm giving this establishment 5 stars.  I walked in, got seated within seconds, got served my drinks quick, food was great, and got checked our quick. I like that about a place. Efficiency without loosing the quality when under pressure. The staff was kind,  attentive and accommodating. I had the tomato, spinach, and cheese crepe... I added eggs and bacon. Iced mocha to finish it off. Loved my experience."}
{"text":"A great place to go after a hangover. That said the crepes are nothing to write home about. Good Italian sodas and a nice ambiance, all in all coming here after a rough night will make for a better day."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for an afternoon brunch because I have been wanting crepes. As we went in we were seated and it was very slow and we felt like we were a bother that we were there. I ordered a crepe with strawberries and my husband got a bagel with eggs and bacon. First off my crepe tasted like a soggy tortilla, I was quite depressed because knowing what an actual crepe tastes like getting this instead was seriously sad. Not only that but my husbands bacon was MICROWAVED..what the hell? Sad to say your stores name shouldn't have \"crepes\" in it if you can't make them. So, unfortunately the best part of this place was the hot chocolate..."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast place! I didn't know what a crepe was until I ate here, and now I'm hooked. Order the iced caramel or pumpkin pie coffee (iced or blended). For your crepe, I prefer The Graceland. It's a combination of peanut butter, bananas, and honey mixed into perfection. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also add bacon, even though it's not on the menu. It's becoming more popular because those who have been here are sharing how amazing it is."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been in heart of Ahwatukee for the past few years and one of the best kept 'secrets' in the 'Tuke'.  Great little breakfast/lunch spot with outstanding coffee drinks (the cappuccino is perfect) and many varieties of homemade crepes.  Good vibe and one of a kind in Ahwatukee.  The only reason I am not giving a five star review is two things:  no music playing in the background for some odd reason; personal huge pet peeve of mine and worse, the two ladies that own/manage this establishment do not come off as the friendliest people in the world.  Maybe it was a bad morning for both of them but I've never understood running a small business (or any business) and not being friendly and personable to its customers but fortunately the other attributes makes up for this short coming."}
{"text":"I gave this place three stars although the food is worthy of four or more the service is only worthy of two stars. Our actual server Terry was friendly it was the service from the people around her dropping off the food that was more on the rude side.    I would come back 1 more time as maybe it was an off day.  Update May 7th: my wife my mom and I went there today to try this again see if service was any better but it was worse. We sat down and waited quite a while no coffee no nothing just menus dropped off.   Then we looked around and realized how many tables were still waiting on food and there's only one chef on duty it was time to leave so we left.   Too bad because we really enjoyed the food. Changed to 2 stars because of service."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my sister last weekend. It was the perfect compromise since I wanted breakfast food and a latte and she was in lunch mode. I got a ham, egg and cheese crepe and she got the pesto turkey crepe. Both were delicious! We also ordered \"the Shirley\" to split for dessert and it was awesome. Loved the decor and ambiance. Very cool and modern looking but still quiet and relaxing.   The only reason I didn't give this place four stars is b/c we both had upset stomachs after the meal. May have just been a coincidence, though. I will definitely go back for further experimentation. The food was just too good."}
{"text":"I love this place. Honestly, walked in and they greeted me. Felt really welcome. Got the Red, White, and Blue crepes. It was amazing! .  I really like the way the women's bathroom looks like. Haha.  Another thing I like is the whole Paris feel this place has. :)"}
{"text":"So good and soooo cheap. I love the turkey pesto or the strawberry cream cheese, but honestly everything is great. My kid orders off the menu...a pb, banana and bacon crepe. Yum!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Cupz N' Crepes for the last year and a half.  I really enjoy it!    It is the only real cafe in the area, but the reason I keep coming back is for their avocado and mushroom crepe.  I used to get it with ricotta, which is AMAZING.  I highly recommend it!  My daughter has had some pretty amazing sweet crepes, too.  Today she had a strawberry and banana crepe with chocolate sauce, strawberry sauce and whipped cream.  I stole a bite of it and it was SO rich.  My daughter couldn't even finish half of it because it was so big.  Cupz N' Crepes renovated a few months ago and the place is really cute!  It still has the Parisian theme from before, but the counter is completely redone.  The walls are all repainted.  The whole place is updated.    The family that owns this place is also very sweet to us, recognizing my daughter immediately every time we enter.  The owner is so sweet to her and makes sure to stop to chat with us, even when it is packed!  I highly recommend you give it a try.  Support local Ahwatukee business and have a great meal at the same time."}
{"text":"This place was so DELISH! It had a cute contemporary/Parisian atmosphere. I had \"Nat's\" which is the equivalent to a buffalo chicken crepe & an Irish Creme Italian Soda. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Don't go for breakfast unless you want sweet crepes. Hubby and I had egg, cheese, bacon crepes and they were soggy, squishy, and tasteless. No side dish-just a single crepe on a small plate. Coffee was good and seemed like lots of people there for lunch-type items so maybe that's better but I was really hoping for something like a crepe Lorraine with hollandaise on it but they have no sauces. Not coming back, unfortunately. Was very much unimpressed."}
