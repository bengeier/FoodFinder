{"text":"If you're looking for a spot that reminds you of your friend's parents' basement in the hood when you were 16 this is the spot. Cheap coals, broken hookahs and stale flavors - the place is dirty with broken seating and small. Nice guy running the place though."}
{"text":"Great customer service let me just begin by saying that, the hookahs are made to perfection and if you dont like your hookah within 2 minutes a complimentary swatch will be done. Very friendly environment always spreading goods vibes. Always come here when im in the city."}
{"text":"Very interesting. . Not your typical shisha joint. .. very friendly staff. Price was right and was a good experience. 

We weren't sure from the outside if it was a store or lounge. They could use some newer comfy couches, and it's small but a cozy atmosphere and super chill vibe."}
{"text":"I love this place, great service especially by the cutie Harkirat, he's so sweet.  When I come back I'll definitely be here.   He's actually so amazing.  SO AMAZING!"}
{"text":"It's a small little spot and it's not fancy at all but it was a great experience. The couches are beat up, but the hookah experience was good, you can pick the music playing and the guy there was cool. I had a great time"}
{"text":"This place is a dump hole. It's disgusting and dirty inside and the staff is nowhere to be found. Whoever wrote a good review about this disgusting place is insane. These owners need to go to other countries and see what a real hookah bar need to look like. This place is legit like a crack house. I wouldn't smoke hookah there if they paid me...."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place quarter star. It was awful. They don't serve anything other than shisha. Play awful music. Never again. Don't even waste ur time"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Was told not to move from where im sitting (even to go to the washroom, or speak to a few people I know there). Harkey told me specifically that these rules are new and only apply to me. I had horrible service from Harkey and saqeeb. Felt uncomfortable in the place from the annoyed looks with the staff. Shisha tasted horrible and like a dirty attic. Did not feel welcome in the business at all. Teach your staff to be nice to returning customers when management is not there."}
{"text":"Cool place in downtown, Toronto. There's a great upstairs that you can check out. Staff are great. I'm pretty sure it's cash only."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday on a whim with a friend . This place is incredible for anyone who loves the element of adventure . Initially downstairs will have you wondering how any large groups of people can possibly fit into one vicinity and may possibly be dismayed to stay but if you allow your curiosity to take the lead you'll be delightfully surprised by the newly opened upstairs floor. Privacy , cozy couches ,eclectic decor, and a place with a sense of community will embrace you . I am so happy stumbling upon here and being welcomed by the young owner named , Tee. The shisha had long and delicious staying power , the crowd is young and I am definitely making a return back ."}
{"text":"Some of the service is awful. Get this: First time I go, my friend and I are treated great by guy upstairs. Good looking guy. Guy on bottom seemed like a lazy fuck. Today I go for my birthday at 1:30! It was only 1:30, and they wouldn't let us go upstairs. They said cuz they don't serve shisha after 1:30 and I said \"even for my birthday we can't even just hang up there\" and they say no. They wouldnt even let us hang upstairs. Nice guys. Even with my visiting mother.

Shout out to the guy from week before around same time who let us smoke and drink to the normal time... 2. Fire the lazy Fuck who doesn't feel like doing any work so he just sits around and does fuck all and Denies entrance."}
