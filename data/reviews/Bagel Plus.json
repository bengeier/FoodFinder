{"text":"Gluten-free bagels - poppy seed only, frozen when you purchase them to go. Tasty and chewy, not overly bland or salty. A bit pricy ($1.50 for each one) and they are smaller than the non-gluten free bagels that you can find at other bagel places. 

White bean soup - yummy, but slightly salty. On their daily special soups menu when I went."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years to buy challa and rye bread. I've been spoiled and won't buy from elsewhere. Delicious breads. My dad used to come to Toronto and order 10 loaves of rye, take them up north with him and freeze them. I'd give them 5 stars but the breads are expensive (but you get what you pay for)."}
{"text":"Went to Bagel Plus for the first time today. What a great place! Staff is very nice and helpful.
Lots of variety, bagels, breads, challah, Also a very nice cosy cafe area with different breakfast options! I will be back for sure! The hardest part was driving home and having my car smell like a bakery..I was very tempted to devour the bread right in the car!"}
{"text":"Lovely staff who are passionate and the food is just right-- comforting and filling. I'd choose this any day over Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"They charged me $1 to slice and toast my bagel and didn't tell me until giving back my change. This place can burn in hell."}
{"text":"Omg!!!!  I have never eaten in this shop but my dad bought me a pack of four gluten free frozen bagels from this shop. All I can say is, these bagels were to die for!  I put one in the microwave on defrost for a little over a minute and then moved it into the toaster oven. This was the BEST gluten free bagel I have ever had. It was moist and soft. It tasted like it was just freshly baked. I highly recommend Bagel Plus's frozen gluten free bagels and will definitely venture here on my own for this scrumptious treat!"}
{"text":"A casual Jewish bakery at the corner of Bathurst & Sheppard. I go there mostly for their Dill and vegetable soup as well as their Greek salad...portions are large and the food is always fresh. While there, you can also purchase the usual bagels and loafs to take home.service is fast and courteous."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong the bread is amazing, but I was slightly disappointed when  I went to get bread, and thought I'd ask if they had gluten free bread. She didn't know what that was, and told me she had whole wheat bread. I asked if they had Spelt, but she gave me a confused look and told me about the rye bread. 

The chalk board on the top, with all their bread choices state single or double. Single means a normal loaf size, maybe slightly smaller. 

She couldn't slice some of my bread because they were still hot. I took it for $3.50 unsliced. But. I was informed later that you can get room temperature ones from the back where they put the \"stale\" bread. It would probably be half price too. 

The cafe in there serves lots of sandwiches and fallafel/pits type things.  Every time I pass by it's usually full with families."}
{"text":"Typical Jewish Bagel shop.   I was there for breakfast, had a friend egg sandwich with tomatoes on a sesame seed bagel.  All I can say is that the bagel was perfect and I could tell from looking at the product display that this is a high quality place home made bakery/restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent and getting better all the time. Our whole family loves this food. The soups, tuna, cabbage rolls, chili, bagels, bread, pie, salad, etc. are all favourites. The service is very caring, too, like getting your order right is the most important thing happening on earth at the moment."}
{"text":"Had a breakfast with some friends, all sorts of egg dishes with the usual Jewish spin, bagels etc. 
All in all was good, very basic stuff but fairly cheap or reasonable for what you get. 
Great place for easy brunch with the family"}
{"text":"soooooo, did you hear about what happened to the goldsteins?  how about the shmaltzbergs son michael, i heard he got an earring!  no? really. what a hoodlum.  oy a broch.

this might make virtually no sense to you at all or it might make all too much sense to you and either way when you are eating in the cramped space that is bagel plus youll hear this conversation in any number of incarnations at much louder decibel levels than in this review.

right at the lip of one of torontos jewish areas (spanning from as far south as eglinton you might say to as far north as sheppard all along bathurst as its spine) sits this boisterous place thats half bakery and takeaway and half sit down.

there are classic chopped eggs, tuna, lox, cream cheese, and herring.  then they have a bit of middle eastern flair with falafel plates.  the falafel are huge and crispy.  they also, make a great spinach salad with a huge ice cream scoop of chopped egg - im sure you can get a huge scoop of just about anything on it.

and just about anything you get, will come with, as you would expect, a nice big bagel.  i always enjoy my food whenever i go - the menu has long been set and they do it well, but i could do with a little less all the bar mitzvah talk.

but when in poland..."}
{"text":"Bagel Plus is the most underrated Jewish bakery in the city. All the talk in this town is about Bagel World and United Bakers. It's a real shame. These two places are great, but Bagel Plus stands head to head with any Jewish bakery in the damn continent. Soups and salads here are among the best in Toronto. The bagels are....maybe not quite as good as Bagel World. But the overall selection of menu items and baked goods puts Bagel Plus in a class of its own. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"After eating here, I don't think it's possible for me to go back to Loblaws bagels again!

When you walk in, the first thing you see is rows and rows of baked goods.  They have a selection of sweets with the typical cookies, muffins, danishes, and turnovers, combined with a large variety of breads, and bagels; from pumpernickel, rye, twist, whole grain, swirl, to a few others I can't think of at the top of my head, this bakery is a bread lover's dream!

Bagel Plus is nothing fancy, nor does it try to be.  The atmosphere is very cozy and reminds me of home; it's a perfect breakfast or lunch destination for families.

Service was decent.  Nothing stellar, but certainly nothing to complain about.

The menu is on a large chalkboard at the back of the store.  A bit confusing to figure out, but once you do, ordering should not be a problem.  They serve a decent variety of bagels, salads, and omelettes.  Before you go and order every food item that calls to you on their menu, fair warning:  the portions are huge.  Don't fret if you don't finish though, they insist you take the home the leftovers and won't take no for an answer.

The greek salad is delicious.  A bit overdressed for my liking, but delicious nevertheless.  The bagels.  Oh the bagels.  Bagel Plus lives up to its name, because the bagels are definitely A+.  And you can't forget the cream cheese.  Rich and creamy, their homemade cream cheese may be double the price of the blocks of cream cheese you can get at the grocery store, but once you get a taste of it, it's definitely worth it!

Bagel Plus is a bit of a journey for me to get to, but for a taste of their bagels and cream cheese, it's definitely worth the trek!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after walking by it constantly for two years. I loved it!
I had a bagel with lox and cream cheese... was wondering why the \"to-go\" version was $6.95 and the sit down version was $9.95, but when it arrived it was a large toasty bagel accompanied with a platter of smoked salmon, onions, cream cheese (a giant ice cream scoop of fresh tasting and fluffy cream cheese) along with tomatoes and cucumber. Tasty! One bagel and I am stuffed. Picked up a cupcake the size of my face for the road, though."}
{"text":"My fiancee  LOVES this place, It must be something in their Greek Salad.
I'm not a big fan, but let's say A FAN.  
It always gets me that there is no menu at this place and you have to order off the wall. So when our waitress comes to take our order, I'm still waiting for the menu.
I usually get some form of sunny side up eggs with lettuce, tomato and a twister bagel and a cup of coffee. A great way to start a Sunday morning. 

If you haven't been to this place, check it out. Also, bring cash and you pay at the cashier."}
{"text":"There are places one takes for granted sometimes, and this is one of them.  The food business is tough work - lots of competition, and I have come to appreciate things more of late, especially a business where you are treated well and get value for money.

This is a bakery located in my hood.  

Bagels, good texture, good variety,  Also have twisters with kosher salt and poppy seeds on top. What's not to love?

It is BLUEBERRY SEASON and their blueberry buns are to die for. This is one of their signature items and they sell out fast.  Spouse and I shared one today.  The top of the bun is sprinkled with rock sugar - old style old school baking.  Love the place."}
{"text":"Eek, nasty, nasty, nasty. Even thinking about this place sends vomiting impulses down my throat, so I'll keep it brief.
Latkes - greasy greasy grease, do not attempt, spare your liver some life.
Bagel - nothing special, rather dry
Eggs - omg, do they cook them weeks in advance?
Overall: everything was fatty, greasy and so was the majority of the customers. You are what you eat after all, but methinks NOT!"}
{"text":"Bagel Plus is the one of the most sanitary bakery I been in the area. 

All the bagels are inside a glass cabinet, all neatly labelled. You can see exactly what they have for the day but if you want to buy any, the staff have to pack that for you.

The trade off is you cannot really cross examine what you are getting. Especially the sweet and pastries they are all kind of hidden behind some waxed paper.

Most of the baked sweets are sold by weight... and they do have brownies and butter tarts too!

More than half of the store space is dedicated to a sit down cafe. You can get bagels in all style, eggs in different style and salad and other light meals."}
