{"text":"I just went with a party of four, which gave me the opportunity to try most of the menu, and it's just okay.   I had the braised beef, which was really amazing, but I think I just ordered well. My husband had the parppadelle (it was just okay) and my friend had one of the pizzas and it was not good. It also didn't even look good (half the battle in my mind).   On the other hand, the atmosphere was amazing and the drink menu was bold. As a date place i think it's pretty good and certainly expensive but I wound't go back on my own - only if I had to for a gathering of some sort."}
{"text":"4 we went,I went with high expectations!!! Dined in the patio, chairs weren't so comfortable.  Over all food was ok, atmosphere just ok.  They moved us inside around 1130 because noise restriction with neighbors. Price was reasonable.  Service was friendly.  Probably won't be come back any time soon.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Had a family brunch at THR & Co. yesterday and couldn't have been happier!  The food was excellent (I had the decadent braised beef cheek and eggs, my aunt said the burger was the best she'd ever had, and most others got the cured trout benedict and couldn't stop raving about the harissa hollondaise!).  The servers were extremely accommodating too--they even went so far as to turn down the music when we asked them to since some of my older relatives were having trouble hearing the conversation at the table.  The booth we got was comfortable and roomy, and I loved the space. Nicely spread out and beautifully decorated. That they take brunch reservations is a bonus!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"What a charming place to have a catchup dinner with a friend tonight! THR and Co just re-opened after a summer break and introduced a new menu too. We had the buttermilk fried chicken and flank steak - both were delicious. As a side we had roasted cauliflower and chickpeas with Harissa, olive oil & capers. The standout was the service - our server was extremely helpful and attentive and the owner came by and chatted to us too. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Picture this: my first night in Toronto. Business trip swank time: nothing could be better than a cushy hotel room and a good meal on le town...problem: the \"good\"part of that designation. The squid ink and clam pasta was boring. I didn't know that was possible. And the clams were sittin all chewy n' lonely out of their shells and the tomatoes were grainy and the squid ink pasta (the raison d'être!) lacked all the briny, salty schtuff that is squid ink. Not a happy camper, but one with garlicky breath(!?). And the drink, a trojan horse of a dark and stormy called The Harbord, was not worth the $12 price tag, even with someone else footing the bill (hallelujah t&e). I'd say better luck next time, but there's probs not going to be one of those. I think we'll both get over it."}
{"text":"Great Company, Great Décor...but the service leaves much to be desired....  On a recent visit to THR & Co. we were celebrating a milestone birthday of one of our closest friends.  It was a party of 11 people, large enough to be a good revenue opportunity. I believe  most enjoyed the food.  One couple ordered the cheese and meat appetizer platter of the day, everyone had a taste and we all agreed the veal tongue was the best thing on the platter (all these meats are prepared in-house, impressive).  I had the fig jam crostini also very good and others ordered the bone marrow, which also received great reviews.  My partner had the Merguez pizza and I had the skate fort dinner both very tasty dishes and ones that we would go back to restaurant to have again. Mushroom pizza delicious. Potato croquettes were also great.The birthday girl had the beef cheeks for dinner, which she thoroughly enjoyed.  The one disappointment I know of is a friend ordered the pasta with lamb.  The pasta was underdone in attempt to be al dente and the lamb was tasteless and dry.     Wine and conversations of all different topics (I heard people talk about hunting, ethically raised veal, travel, an interesting custom pendant, etc.) were flowing.  So what went wrong with the service?  We were all received well by the FOH - asked if we wanted our coats to be hung, we all had our drink within the first 10 minutes of arrival - great start.  It did take awhile for everyone to arrive and to get settled, but as we were settled we were all feeling little peckish (we had 8:30pm reservations).  We were expecting to be served a customary bread basket, but may be thought that this was something that wasn't offered at this restaurant. So we waited patiently for appetizers.  Eventually bread did arrive, but with DIY butter.  We all called it DIY (do it yourself) butter because it was hard and non-spreadable, we all tried to melt our butter by our table tea light.   It kind of worked; we were hungry so we spread what little butter we could melt on our bread.  Appetizers rolled in and we were happy again!  As I said most of the food was great!  But let's mention that the charcuterie platter of the day was served with no additional bread, our dear friends had to ask for another basket.   The heart of our discontent was our server who kept shifting the focus of our evening on himself.  He kept on re-iterating that he was 50 (and though he looked great for his age) I'm not sure why we needed to know this fact about him, did he expect us to give him compliments throughout the evening? He also paid extra special attention, not to the birthday celebrant but to one particular friend who had a broken heel incident, also she is a model, so she is stunning, over 5'10\", great figure and great cheekbones.  But then he also began to tell her side of the table that his wife is so gorgeous that she stole the attention from Victoria Secret models when they were in the same room.  So again why did we need to hear about him and his wife?  The climax of our discontent came when somehow through no fault of his own, our server breaks the bottle of an expensive wine bottle ordered by the celebrant's husband. Luckily no one was hurt and no permanent wine stains on anyone's clothes but shards of glass went everywhere, the server had to discard the last two glasses poured from the bottle and this incident interrupted the vibe of our evening.  He did replace the two glasses of wine that needed to be discarded, but replaced them with a lower quality wine, which was considered undrinkable.  It is surprising that the server didn't even acknowledge that he gave them a different glass of wine to replace the ones that were lost.  The birthday celebrant asked for the glasses of wine to be replaced for a better quality wine.  This is when the server begins on yet another story about two of the best Canadian sommeliers drinking wine in the South of France which they thought was both the best and worst bottle they have had (worst because of the quality, but best because of the company) - why did we need to be subjected to this story?  It only made the birthday celebrant feel like an \"a**hole\" which she had no problems making him aware that is what he did.   All this and an 18% mandatory gratuity (which by the way he tells us is the industry standard because he has been in he restaurant business for 30 years)!  The experienced left much to be desired. Silver lining - they do separate bills which a lot of restaurants don't do for large groups.  I believe that 10 out of 11 won't be returning...  One more tip - they only have one type of vodka (Absolut) so if you are looking to order a vodka martini you only have one option."}
{"text":"2.5/5! i walked in with very high expectation so that could be part of the reason I was disappointed! For starters, the chickpea fritters were overly salty. The pizza was okay but i've definitely had better. The only shareable plate I truly enjoyed was the burrata. As for mains, the spagetti was good but the steak -- although it was flavourful -- it was not well cut. Finally, the dessert was the biggest disappointment. I was not a fan of the red velvet cake (it did not even taste like red velvet). The only realy highlight of the night (aside from the company) was that we saw Claire Danes. Hopefully her meal was better than ours"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this restaurant, particularly because it was associated with the Harbor Room, but in the end the meal was inconsistent at best and mediocre overall.  The wine list is extremely overpriced, but this is nothing new for a Toronto dining establishment.  Still do not understand the rational of an Italian oriented menu paired with a wine list skewed to French but each to his own. The price per quality ratio of the food was reasonable and service attentive.  Nothing overtly wrong but nothing stellar - can't see frequenting again anytime soon.  Many better options out there in the $200 price range."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the space is nice kind of hipster chic.  Service is pretty good.  Food is all right but not super memorable or wow.  Came for one brunch and one dinner.  Portions could improve too as I came home and was still hungry and I ate a mushroom pasta."}
{"text":"Nice, but I won't be rushing back.  Pretty patio that is worth enjoying as the warm weather wanes. Great service - courteous, efficient, pleasant. I don't take that for granted. Cauliflower appetizer has had me craving roasted cauliflower with Harissa sauce ever since. Rum cup cocktail managed to combine two of my favourite summer cocktails - pimm's cup and dark & stormy - bravo!  But my bavette steak was a jaw-wearying challenge that couldn't be forgiven even with the yummy sauce and perfect frites that attempted to distract me from it. I threw in the towel. Leaving the steak half eaten rather than risking further jaw muscle strain. Bavette steak and frites is a meal I order whenever I get the chance, so I know it can be a lot better!  Maybe I just need to try a different dish. If I'm on the block and haven't decided to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Really nice contemporary Italian. Came here for a family dinner two weeks ago. Tried a number of appetizers and mains ( you have to share with family) , and I was impressed with quality of all the dishes. I had the squid ink pasta and it was unlike any pasta I had eaten before, with the noodles having an interesting spicy bite and being of a constituency closer to Chinese or udon Noodles. This may sound not to everyone's taste, but they were really good. Top notch delivery.   Service was a bit strange and super laid back. .. Maybe a bit too on the laid back hipster side but still prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"I had the chance to revisit THR after a long time away.  It was interesting to me to go back and see that I'd given it 4 stars; in my mind it was unmemorable and I didn't have a strong positive feeling about it.  Perhaps back then I wasn't in full serious-Yelp mode yet!  I am a big fan of Cory, the chef, though, as I love the burger at Harbord Room (although the cocktails suck there too - what's with that, yo. Get a better cocktail program) and I am huge huge fan of his newest venture, Flock.  So I was excited to see what happened since they updated their menu.  First off - lovely patio.  A bit uneven, so you'll be wobbly, but it was such a nice night out it didn't matter.  Service was excellent.  Well informed, well timed, friendly.  The prices are very reasonable and approachable, with the most expensive main being $25.  What we ordered: - we shared both calamari apps, and the blistered peppers n olives - cauliflower and chick peas - flank steak and mac n cheese  I had a cocktail to start, but, not surprisingly, it sucked.  I don't think it should be this way.  They only have 6 cocktails on the menu, so they might as well make them delicious.  I switched to wine after that, since they have a good by the glass list.  I liked everything we ordered, the standouts for me being the cauliflower and the mac n cheese (super strong cheeses in there, if you aren't someone who likes a pungent cheese you should avoid), but I'd order it all again.  Flank steak was fairly boring but definitely a good choice for those who prefer more by-the-book food.  Fries were perfect, chimichurri sauce was actually really good (I fearfully got it on the side but was pleasantly surprised).  Wouldn't have minded some ketchup, but I'm a freak.  I think I like this place better than Harbord Room now, unless I'm jonesing for a burger."}
{"text":"\"DIES SATURNI. To-do List: 1) Nothing 2) THR & Co.\"  Word ^   THR & Co. I like your style. I'm also a fan of your big bro, Harbord Room and so I guess it's not too surprising...  We felt like having a simple pizza night and ordered two pies and two salads. Tasty dishes, enjoyable presentation and fairly priced.   Salads  Grilled Romaine & Chicory Crispy Pig Ear, Cured Tomato, Toscano w/ Chopped Caper & Anchovy Dressing [11]  *Not a complete hit, but a fine side for pizza*  Fresh Burrata and Watermelon with Avocado,  Pickled Watermelon Rind, Arugula Sprouts,  Sunflower Seeds and Vincotto [13]    *Delicious ingredient combination and texture*  Pies  Nettle & Ricotta Farm Egg, Pancetta, Porcini Oil, Potato, Sheep Milk Cheddar & Smoked Salt [14]  Crumbled Merguez Sausage Romesco, Grilled Scallion, Cotija Cheese, Dried Olive & Chopped Parsley [14]  *YES & YES to both. Extra notes: great-tasting semolina crust (nice change from the typical charred Neapolitan style), appreciate the scissors*  I started with a Campari soda (pretty presentation with two large fresh olives and perfectly sculpted ice cubes meticulously stacked). The only complaint I have here is echoed in another review below me (Amelia J.) - it isn't crystal clear when the restaurant lists $7 for their aperitifs, but generally ends up charging an extra $5 depending on how you order. Next time I will be more specific with my order or ask for a clarification. That said, I enjoyed my drink very much.      The service is cool, relaxed (yet attentive) and generally excellent. The acoustics are good. The music you hear has all ages appeal (much like the restaurant itself) - think of your favourite Bar Mitzvah tunes, MJ's \"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\" or cool classics like Sly & The Family Stone's \"Hot Fun In The Summertime\". Nice design and mood.  ...and so when am I going back for more? Fatty Natty wants some slow-cooked chocolate cheesecake."}
{"text":"We went to THR&co after trying to get a table at the Harbord Room, but it being full, on a Tuesday, at 8pm. We had been there before but I really wanted the burger, as it IS one of the best in the city.  So anyway, we got to THR&co at 8.01pm as it is literally 2 doors west and were greeted at the door by a kind man (whom I believe was the bartender) who sat us at the bar (we prefer to sit at the bar) and gave is menus.   We got our drinks and ordered food. We started with the Burrata-delicious. My fiancé has an allergy to red wine so we informed the bartender of this and he changed our mains order without any fuss. I had the pork and pizza and she had the mozzarella pizza. When they arrived I real loses there were mushrooms on my pizza which I don't like, so I picked them off. The pizzas were thin crust and came with big scissors to cut them with, I thought that was kind of cool.  The room is ambient with nice music and mellow lighting. Food was solid and service was great.  I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Feel like I had everything on the menu tonight, and it was all so good.  Great waitress who gave us amazing recommendations on dishes and wine pairings.  Had squid ink pasta, pizza, steak, fingerling potatoes, sugar snap peas, tuna appetizer, chick pea fritters, amazing Argentinean Pinot and the cheese plate with an Ontario light wine.  So good, great experience"}
{"text":"Delicious and excellent service. I was there last Saturday evening for dinner with my girlfriend followed by going to see a play called Parade at the theatre located next to Trinity College which is one of University of Toronto colleges"}
{"text":"After many years of loving THR & Co's sister restaurant, the Harbord Room, we finally gave it a shot. The Harbord Room was packed last week when we stopped by and so we went down the block to THR & Co.  You must be warned that they have some silly things on their menu, like EVOO, which is a fancy way of writing extra virgin olive oil.   Putting that side, there are a lot of wonderful things.  As much as I love the Harbord Room and their selection of music, it is smaller, harder to get into and much louder. THR & Co. has much more seating and availability and it is easier to carry on a conversation. Both are great. It just depends what mood you are in and how last minute you are trying to make reservations.   The food was lovely. The mushroom pizza with caramelized onions was delicious and made on a slightly wavy, crispy, smokey crust. The black spaghetti with squid ink was very tasty and included the most tender calamari I have ever eaten. I only wished the portions were slightly larger.  For dessert we got the brownie with sour cherries, sponge toffee and banana ice cream. The cherries and toffee were particularly tasty, however, as a full dessert it did not blow me away, as many of the desserts at the Harbord Room have in the past.   We were very happy to find this new option for great food in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I went to THR & Co earlier this week and absolutely loved my meal! The place was packed and I'd certainly recommend making a reservation before you stop by. We sat at the bar since we didn't have a reservation. The bar is big enough to sit comfortably and eat your meal without feeling like you're cramped in.   We shared a some bottles of wine, and also ordered a variety of dinner items. I had the sea bream (the daily catch from Hooked), and shared two sides - the carrots and the rapini. The fish was so, so, so tasty. It was a great combination of flaky with a crispy skin and was paired with a unique sauce. The portion size was also quite large - I think we could have shared the fish (between two) and shared a salad with the meal as well. Either way, though, I absolutely loved the fish! Others tried the half chicken and a pizza, and we were all incredibly satisfied with our meals.   We then shared two pieces of the chocolate cheesecake which was wonderful, rich, and creamy. Super tasty.   While it took a fairly long time for our food to come out, when it did, it was well worth the wait. And, the service we received all night was excellent. The bartender was extremely friendly and attentive.   Overall, I'd recommend THR & Co to my friends again in a heartbeat and cannot wait to visit again to try some more items off the menu!"}
{"text":"The food was 'meh'! There, I said it! Yet another place in Toronto where the decor is gorgeous/trendy but people rave about the food - over priced may I add. Truthfully, the only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because the service was great!"}
{"text":"Gluten-free pasta available (most of the time, call in advance). Really love this place!"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5. The food is good if slightly over contrived. Some great gems on the beer and wine list but no taps is a negative.  Cocktails are over mixologized and there isn't a good savoury option. Staff is great = Light, bright and the right amount of funky. Food is tasty but a few too many extremes. I  love the butter lettuce salad and a few of the pastas. I hate the pizza with shears = come'on!    Great booth in the front but push for a booth or take the bar because the rest is jammed. Too small for the numbers.   Worth a try and great for a foursome in the booths. But not going to be dating your life by it. Let's see whether they can kill patio season and maybe they can bump to a 4."}
{"text":"Went with a large group of people for a birthday - staff was friendly and accommodating. Located in a sweet little corner spot along one of my favourite streets in Toronto, THR & Co. offers some great fare as well as tasty cocktails. Their daily rotating special was interesting and most things on their regular menu were also quite tasty. The roasted bone marrow was particularly memorable.   I had the pot de creme and it was sinfully creamy and heavenly! All-in-all, a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails. Nice place to share a few apps before having mains. Happy they had 2 sizes for all there pasta dishes - allowed us to share more desserts! Really mixed crowd. Only complaint would be tables were too close together."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  With all the buzz surrounding this place, I really wanted to love it but it wasn't the experience I had hoped it would be.  I will say up front that the service was absolutely fantastic, no complaints at all about that. The food on the other hand I thought was good but not mind-blowing. Definitely nothing was bad but I wasn't wowed by the mains. It didn't help that the menu posted on their website that day did not match the menu presented at the restaurant and that the one item I really had my heart set on was not available.  The menu is divided into appetizers, pastas, pizzas and meat entrees (of which there were 3 - fish (branzino), beef cheek and the roast chicken/chicken sausage duo).   We ended up ordering the beef heart tartare and the small house-cured meat board. The tartare had nice texture but lacked zing. Liked the idea/texture of the rice papads it was served with, but probably wouldn't order it again. The charcuterie board was fantastic though and featured bison pepperoni, rillette, mortadella, pickled veggies, and another meat that escapes my memory at the moment.  For mains we went with the ricotta and farm egg pizza with cured pork, the braised beef cheek (that was seasoned in chimichurri) and a side of rapini. Both mains were nice but not special.  The desserts were pretty good. I had the buttermilk panna cotta with sea buckthorne sorbet and berries and rhubarb. Only complaint with that one was the tart fruit overpowered the delicate panna cotta somewhat. The pink peppercorn wafer was unique though. Husband had the chocolate ganache which was super delicious.   Cocktails were creative and delicious, wine list was a little uninspiring.  Tables, as others have noted, are much too close together especially considering their form factor (you end up sitting closer to the person next to you than your own dining companion).  If I were to return it would be for just cocktails and charcuterie, and I'd come with a bigger group of friends (vs. dinner for two)."}
{"text":"So I was here twice in a two month period. First time, wasn't sure what to expect but was hopeful, given that it's run by the same person as my beloved Harbord Room - and its interesting menu. Heather was our server, we were seated in the great back booth and were delighted to find that they had a special Valentine's Day menu w wine pairings ($145 for two people - I had to ask a few times to make sure I wasn't dreaming). The service was fantastic, Mike was our wine guy and he was friendly and informative. The food was fantastic - the wine pairings weren't bad and the price was excellent! The second time we were back and I was excited to try the \"regular\" dinner menu. First we started off with the marrow and the steak tartare. The marrow was good - made extra flavourful by the addition of the crispy fried onions. Now the tartare - OH. MY. GOD. I tend to order steak tartare whenever/wherever possible. THIS was the absolute best steak tartare I've EVER had. If I hadn't been so eager to try the black spaghetti (which was fresh and zingy tasting with great little bites of shrimp and other seafood) I would've just ordered a second one for my main. They make all of their pasta in house and it really makes a difference. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Update: this place is still amazing, but I've been three times in the last few months, and the fish is always sea bream. I'm starting to wonder if it's really a fresh catch of the day or if they just get massive amounts of the same fish and call it a daily feature until it runs out.  We had a great server at first but he had to leave halfway through dinner and left us with the world's slowest server. So even though this wasn't perfect, the food is still worth it. Love the music here too!"}
{"text":"Checked out the newly opened THR & Co. last night with a party of 11 people. Wow, this restaurant ran like a well oiled machine, and there was none of the bumps you encounter sometimes with brand new restaurants.  The space is gorgeous, bright, & clean. It's actually a little deceiving because it's smaller than it initially looks due to this large windows on the inside! There is a nice space out front for a patio, which should be in place shortly.  Our server was a.) super knowledgeable, b.) quite charming & friendly c.) very present & d.) easy on the eyes, teehee.  The food was really, really good, and not just mine, but that was the consensus from all 11 of us at the table.  I had the crumbled merguez sausage pizza. The crust was nicely done, the ingredients fresh & tasty (the cotija cheese on this thing was SO, SO good. I would literally bathe the pizza in this cheese, if it were up to me :P), and the portion size was pretty good. If you are eating more than one course, you could easily share the pizza with someone else.  I also had the Lemon Poppyseed Cake with buttermilk ice cream & marshmallow meringue. Wow. It was even better than it sounded! The cake was sooo fresh and moist, and the buttermilk ice cream was really delicious and added a yummy dairy element to the dish. The marshmallow meringue pieces were little crispy bits of heaven. Yum.  I stole a bite of the slow cooked chocolate cheesecake and it was incredibly decadent and delicious. When I come back (which I most certainly will), I'm going to devour one of those bad boys!  THR has an array of daily sorbets & ice cream that they make in house, so if you're not going to go full out with one of the larger desserts, I highly recommend you try one of these! They are awesome!  Side note for all you DDs out there, they have some fantastic juices and dry sodas if you're looking for something nonalcoholic! I had a pink lemonade and it was nice & refreshing on a humid day :).  Fantastic experience! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"If this was a blind date:  Her cocktail list was lame.  Her compressed carrot salad was gorgeous.  The oxtail bucatini pasta was firm but small and not overly delicious.  The mushrooms were sexy.  But in the end, I liked her sister Harbord Room at lot better."}
{"text":"We always come here for the family style sunday dinner. You share food within your table but you don't need to sit besides strangers(I've done that at other places, I don't like making friends at a restaurant) Always happy with it. Cheaply priced (30 for 3 course meal) for the quality of cooking and generous size, way better than the summer/winterlicous joke some other restros do."}
{"text":"I was dragged here last night, and what a drag! The best drag of my week! A delicious drag result!! Big fan o' this joint - - fancy enough to be really special, affordable enough to be really comfortable.  The room:  A nice balance of warm wood, stone and glass - we agreed it kind of feels like being in a reallly expensive restaurant in 1995 California, maybe because we both liked 1995 and think we'd like California.  The rose stone, horseshoe-shaped bar is a perfect casual date seat, and great for people watching. As a note, the glass washer is in the back, so there's no madness/steam/vrooming in the bar area. The booths, which looked like teak tables to my untrained eye, have dark green leather round-U seating which looks like a treat as well.    OK THE FOOD 1. Got a half bottle ($23) of a dry Grenache rose. I liked it. Big enough to satisfy with food, dry enough to drink throughout, a nice minerality in the finish. Wine list is good and accessible. I love the half-bottle option for work nights.  2. Starter: a grilled radicchio and romaine take on the caesar. Nice and charred bitterness from the radicchio, creamy dressing wrapped into the romaine (a tiny bit too much dressing IMO which I forgive because I have a *thing* about dressing quantity), nice fresh tasting anchovies and generally well-balanced flavours. The sharpness was almost overwhelming, but paired with a pizza it was great.  3. Main: Pizza! P I ZZ a. We got the Nettle and Ricotta pizza (an easy share if you're not famished). Came with a lovely fresh sunnyside up egg that our waiter spread over top of nice'n'salty pancetta. The smoked salt sounds frouffy but it comes through so nicely with the egg yolk. The 'sauce' is a kind of wild pesto I suppose. A nice fragrant green concoction; lovely blended into the warm ricotta. I was not hungry. I ate it all.    Another bonus: pastas come in small or large portions for you..people who like that.   A happy addition to a strip that seemed to be fizzing out! I believe again!"}
{"text":"Came here for an early pre-concert dinner, reservations at 5:30pm. Atmosphere was cozy, warm and modern.  Selection on the menu was fantastic - 2 pizzas, 4 pastas, 5 mains and a few starters/appetizers.  I loved the December Spice cocktail I had, perfect balance of spice, sweet and sour. I shared the mushroom pizza with duck egg onto - this was a perfect starter and so delicious. Presented on a pizza cutting board with huge scissors.  For my main, I was disappointed that the squid ink spaghetti that Yelpers loved was no longer on the menu! Instead I had the spaghetti with sea urchin butter and cured pork. Pasta was al dente (I like al dente, but this time it was marginally maybe a touch too al dente for my liking). The flavours were unique, buttery and had umami pow.  For dessert, I had the sticky rum cakes with buckthorn gelato and crispy toffee bits. It was quite yummy, but the proportions were a bit off (too much cake, not enough sauce/toffee/gelato), I left bits of cake on the plate at the end because it was too dry without the other toppings.  Unfortunately, our THR & Co experience closed on a sour note. Our server decided to come and let us know at 7:45pm, that the people who reserved our table for 8pm had already arrived, in a tone that made me feel a bit offended. I did not feel the need for him to tell us this, as we were 2 bites from finishing dessert and would have asked for the bill in 5 minutes if he had not come by. Also, it was not 8pm yet and their 8pm guests arrived early, which is beyond our fault. It was complete unnecessary. Unsure if I will be coming back (I am quite sensitive to service standards)."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. The days special was a rock lobster crustini that I could have eaten 10 of. Our mains were the house made rigatoni and the sea bream. Both were amazing. Service was prompt and professional leaving us with a wonderful experience overall."}
{"text":"Cute little resto.  Friendly staff.  Delicious food.   Convenient location.   It sure is an a-ok!!"}
{"text":"Nice, casual vibe where we enjoyed tapas (there are full dishes as well). We shared charcuterie and scallops. Good service."}
