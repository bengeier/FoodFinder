{"text":"À découvrir! Nouveau petit resto à Montreal dans un coin qui manque de bonne cuisines (aka, le centre-ville). J'ai adoré le nougat glacé aux amelanchiers! Tellement bon!"}
{"text":"Félicitations aux propriétaires de ce nouveau bistro du centre-ville de Montréal! Cet endroit deviendra rapidement un chouchou de foodies du midi. Mérite amplement le 4* +... Respect des aliments, produits locaux, Excellent départ."}
{"text":"Didn't have any food there aside from appetizers, but thoroughly enjoyed their outdoor patio sipping wine and coffee. Very good and non-intrusive service."}
{"text":"Dinner our first night in Montreal overall did not disappoint.  I came out feeling full but not stuffed.  Ordered the papperdalle with shrimp.  Good dish. I I don't like it when the description doesn't list all the ingredients so I was slightly disappointed when my dish came out with a large amount of green and red peppers. I like them but it's not my favorie veggie so I left a lot on the plate.   Same thing with dessert- went with the cashew vanilla pot de creme. Tasty but also seemed to have oreo like cookies in it.  In my quest to get to the bottom of the mystery, I overate and got a little high on the sugar content.   Our server was super nice.  He asked if we wanted to order in french or english. They had a nice patio to sit on and didn't chase us out of there when we were done.  One friend ordered the burger with goat cheese for dinner and she said it was one of the top burgers she's ever had."}
{"text":"I give very few \"5 stars\" to my reviews but this one is totally worth it! We came here for this year's edition au \"MTL à Table\" and it was partly just luck as we tried to find one good table that was available the same night. As you might expect, a lot where fully booked but we manage to get the last table here... and for 5 people.  The place is small and hugely popular at lunch time, you'll only get here at that time with a reservation and you should reserve at night as well.  What can you expect? A great bistro experience without the attitude. Our server was one of the co-owner (Audrey, I believe) and her service was perfect and on top of that, since she's an owner, is able to offer special wines not yet on the wine list (she told us that all their wines are by private importation).  Among out group of five was my 18 years old son who had an issue with the main courses offered on the set menu for \"MTL à table\" and it was the only menu available that night. The option was either a fish, scallops or beef tartare none of which he wanted to eat. Despite that, our server/owner was able to negotiation with the chef and find a delicious ad-hoc replacement for our son.  I don't usually eat cooked food but I made an exception for the scallops dish which were described as \"Roasted scallops - Browned butter butternut squash puree, speculoos, coffee infused veal jus, aragula salad\" and I don't regret trying. The mix was delicious and the plate very generous with a good count of large scallops. The only reserve that I have is that it was a bit generous on the \"fleur de sel\".  The ambiance of the restaurant is very relaxed and friendly which I believe mirror the personally of the owners. The choice of the \"antique multi filaments\" light bulbs just by itself create a relaxed and cozy setting. They also have a terrace outside for those days where Montreal's climate is not too brutal.  The warmth of the bistro and it's staff along with great food and reasonable prices makes for a winning combinaison and a place where you want to come back and bring some friend so they can experience it as well. No wonder the place have quickly became so popular!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. It's packed during lunch time with office workers in the surrounding areas. During dinner hours, it's considerably more quiet. I got the salmon tar tar for $24 and it was totally worth it. It came with crackers and a large salad. I was full but not the heavy type of full. I think I'm going to try Albert salad with the poached eggs next time."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. Friendly staff whom do not hover but make sure you are all set, absolutely delicious food and a good drink selection. I had the chef's special which happened to be filet mignon with greens and potatoes.  It was so good I honestly wanted to go back a second night during our trip. 10/10 - we'll be back during our next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and ordered from the MTLaTable menu. I started with a wonderful cream of chestnut soup and my main was the braised short ribs. WOW! The short ribs were so tender and full of flavour. It was really top notch! For dessert I had their tatin and it was perfect. Eat it slowly to savour every bite! This is one of the best culinary experiences I had in a while. The atmosphere is warm and cozy and if you're a small group, they have a semi private alcove which would be perfect for an intimate celebration."}
{"text":"Jade both the salmon and beef tar tar... Great! Nice seating outside and great service!"}
{"text":"It started off very promising - the waiter was extremely helpful.  Turns out the omelette is only offered at lunch (so why is it on the dinner menu?).  He went off to the kitchen, the chef agreed to make the omelette, and it was delicious! He also helped us choose an excellent wine by allowing us to taste test two reds. After delivering our food he disappeared and through the window we could see him and the other staff doing shots with a group of customers.  I saw at least three rounds of shots.  Eventually another staff member brought our check. We enjoyed our food, but the service was, to say the least, disappointing."}
{"text":"I cant give a full review of the food at Albert (yet), simply because we came here for a glass of wine after work and only ordered some french fries to share. However, what I can say is that I really enjoyed the ambience and energy of this place. They have a great location with both in and outdoor seating.  The inside is comfortable and classy without being pretentious. Service was impeccable, friendly and very helpful in choosing the wines according to each of our preferences and very attentive to make sure we were never kept waiting for anything (even water refills).  The white wine we had there was delicious and refreshing and the french fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned and came with a little dipping sauce. My experience at Albert left a very good impression and after all the good reviews I am seeing on the food I will definitely come back for dinner and/or lunch in the near future. Great upscale spot for a date or to spend some time with friends."}
{"text":"With only 8 reviews there is always concern that the owners buddies got on Yelp and said good things. Buddies or not this place is fantastic. I must preface this by saying I had a 5 year old and a 10 year old with me - and I don't speak French. The wait staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. The place is small, but had a nice intimate feel. The menu is limited, but the chef knows the product and the execution was perfect. This was not only my best meal in Montreal it was also probably the best value. I cannot say enough good things about this place. Go and enjoy."}
