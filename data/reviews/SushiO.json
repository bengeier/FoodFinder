{"text":"Worst sushi I have ever eaten. I went for AYCE lunch. I  love sushi and go eat it all the time. Sushi o has the lowest quality sushi and service. Everything was poorly made. The sushi was bitter tasting, and the sashimi was scaly and not smooth. It tasted like its been out for days because it was warm. Overall everything but the water was disappointing."}
{"text":"My fiance and I weren't starving (for once!) but needed some dinner. We went to Sushi-O to try to satisfy a craving. We chose not to take the All-you-can-eat option because we didn't want to gorge and thought it would be cheaper to order a few things a la carte. We got a mango roll and a green dragon roll - YUM!!! their rolls are amazingly good. Then we ordered a couple of appetizers - chicken skewers (can't remember the name) and pan seared scallops - BAD CHOICE. The skewers were tiny and had bland, overcooked dark meat chicken on it. The scallops were only visible with a magnifying glass. Seriously, there were 5 scallops that were no bigger than the size of a nickle each. What the hell is that? And did they really charge me $8 for that?! Yes, yes they did.  Still hungry, I ordered a ginger salad roll. Yum. The waitress said we got 2 free california rolls - I shrugged and thought, \"great, free rolls!\". But the waitress only brought them over after we were almost finished everything else, and after I asked her about them. When they arrived at our table, they were in a take-out container. I said to my fiance, \"are we leaving?!\" but then noticed everyone had their free california rolls in take-out containers (weird). We ate our sad little california rolls in our sad take-out containers then paid more than what we would have if we would have taken the all-you-can-eat option. BOOOOOO. I would never recommend anyone to order anything but rolls at this place. Portions are ridiculous, service is mediocre, and it feels like they want you to leave. WTF."}
{"text":"I live around the corner so I go here a lot and the service has greatly improved since the initial reviews! The sushi is definitely the best in the area and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I never came back here after my last experience with the service. However, their $3.99 Sapporo beer special and $1.99 bubble-tea signs outside their restaurant attracted both my hubby and I for lunch on a Sunday.  The lunch AYCE has some nice sushi options. They do lack a wide variety compared to other places I've been. The service was really good here but it did become slow a bit near the end. I also found the servers to be helpful and kind.  The sushi maki options on the AYCE menu were my favorite. I personally love the dynamite maki- fresh, big and yummy! Basically all the sushi options are good but other dishes suffered. The spicy salmon pizza is good but too oily and I've had better. The deep fried tofu was gross, the spring rolls were disgusting and the salmon teriyaki was okay-slightly salty. They also have a soup, salad and ice-cream bar. Both soup and salad were bland and boring. I did not get a chance to try the ice-cream. Sticking to the sushi options is the way to go.  Lunch AYCE- $13.99 Dinner AYCE- $18.99 5% discount if you pay cash. Free california rolls with any take-out order.  Overall, the AYCE at SushiO was a bit disappointing. However, the sushi was so good and the service did improve significantly compared to my last visit. I can see myself coming back for the yummy sushi!"}
{"text":"Sushi was alright - nothing special, but the service was pretty bad. The waitress seemed very busy and barely stopped at our table except to drop off food and it took about 30 minutes for us the get all 4 rolls of sushi we ordered. Another waitress had to come fill up our glasses with water as we waited as our own waitress seemed too rushed to do so herself. I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Waited 45mins for our first plate of sushi and sashimi.  Part of 2nd round of food never came while we received items we never ordered. Service was awful.   Never again."}
{"text":"Sushi O,  Great spot for all you can eat sushi in a nice area (close to home) of town.  I must admit, if you require the largest sushi variety in the menu, Sushi O is probably not the place to go. Personally, it works for me. I enjoy a few items plus the delicous Tempura Vegetables and their spicy chicken dish.  The price is decent and the place has a nice decor and atmosphere, itis very friendly.  The service could be better for sure. The servers are on the slow side, but the sushi makes up for it. They also routinely either miss some of your orders or bring orders twice. Expect this but it really does not subtract from the overall experience.  I recommend this place, been here 10+ and always have a good time. They have a nice patio and nice inside space, big enough for large groups. The bonus, you are in the Yonge-Eglinton area... visit one of the many bars around to digest all the sushi you stuffed yourself with"}
{"text":"Love the price but the food was unimpressive. $10 for AYCE lunch? What a steal! It was a nice looking place. My group was actually trying to find sushi star but we happened upon these signs summoning us in for $10 AYCE lunch and we couldn't resist. We should have kept trying to find sushi star. At least I knew I liked the spicy salmon there. This place made very mediocre food. I often go to yang's kitchen in markham where the food is AWESOME. Sushi O's is nothing like it. The spicy salmon was the biggest disappointment. That's something I have to have in a sushi place every time. One good thing that happened during our experience is that they ignored the quantities we wrote down and just gave us one of each thing we ordered...it's good bec we didn't know the food wasn't great."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Much worse service. Overall terrible experience. Even considering it's a non-Japanese AYCE. The owner seemed extremely contrite, though. There are many places to check out in Toronto so unfortunately I don't give second chances. If you do, then take a second chance on SushiO.   Otherwise there are plenty of other AYCE sushi. Nearby, I recommend Echo Sushi at Yonge and Davisville."}
{"text":"Sushi-o was a great, affordable sushi restaurant in the uptown area. Their unlimited specials and cheap beer made it a really great place for students on a budget. They offered cheap food without compromising on quality, most notably their all you can eat special for $16 on Tuesday nights which were always busy.  Unfortunately, as of early 2013 the place has closed down. A sign on the door says it's going to be replaced with the vegetarian restaurant chain \"Fresh\" this summer. Having been to the Fresh at College and Bathurst I'm excited to have one closer to home, but I am definitely going to miss Sushi-o's great, fresh and affordable sushi."}
{"text":"I have never tried their AYCE. Their $10 lunch specials are the way to go!  Black dragon rolls are a steal, and very nicely made (priced at $10 on the regular menu). It comes with your choice of gyoza or spring rolls, a maki roll, soup and salad. The salad dressing tastes like none other. It's one part gingery, one part sweet, one part sour...Pairs wonderfully with the crisp salad!"}
{"text":"This place has so many bad reviews but I found it to be fine. I work in the area and often have their lunch special $10 plus tax and tip for edamame, avacado maki and I just have tuna maki but you can have dragon rolls and other things. Plus free cali rolls with every order. I have had salmon, tuna and whit tuna sashimi, dumplings, spicy tuna roll. All were good.   I have never had a problem with the service...in all fairness I am usually picking up lunch or if I have eaten in, we let them know we are in a hurry and the service is fine."}
{"text":"It had a decent beginning but went DOWNHILL as our meal went along.  The SELF-SERVE Soups(Miso, Hot & Sour) were bland, there was cold Mussels, Shrimps and Salad Bar(Good), as well as Ice Cream(Good).  We got a great server to begin with but as time pasted and 10pm came around, we saw a couple other staff standing and watched the few of us tables like HAWKS with their arms crossed.  At that time, the Sushi items were still coming but our Kitchen items seemed to take forever and then I overheard the next table asking why THEIR Kitchen items are not ready and re-ordered again, that was when I got the hint that their Kitchen just quit for the night and if anything arrived it would probably be subpar.  One of the awaiting waiters came by around 10:30pm to tell us last call when I was facing the sign with the hours stating 11:30pm CLOSE.  I must be holding them back from Saturday clubbing or something.  The food was in general acceptable but I wouldn't order the Chicken Karaage again and my Chicken Wing Karaage never arrived for me to rank it so FAIL it is.  Yakitori had the sauce on the bottom of the plate instead of on the Chicken.  The Green Dragon Roll and BBQ Eel Roll were fine but the Sashimi I'm still not quite sure about.  Beef Enoki Mushroom Rolls are Good but small portions.  I walked pass this place to go to Fin Izakaya but then noticed SushiO had more patrons, so it made sense to come here instead right?  I guess that LOGIC no longer applies, or at least be very selective.  They even had a Patio space which I've never personally experienced for a Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that the sushi isn't 5 star, it's about 3.5, but the experience certainly warrants all 5. There are like a thousand little touches that make me love this place. I've been walking by this place pretty much daily for two weeks and figured it was a dump because their signs indicate they are almost giving away sushi. They have lunch combos starting at $2.99 according to the signage (I don't know, didn't get that).  I went for the AYCE lunch for $9.99. The space is bigger than I expected and was quite clean. The staff were super attentive. They asked me about three times how things were. They also left the order sheet on the table and crossed off the items as I received them. Awesome considering how orders like to go missing at AYCE places. There is a self-serve area with salad, soup, and ice cream. This rocks because I can eat way too much green tea ice cream and also put way too much tofu in my miso soup (I HATE when I only get like two cubes of tofu at other places). The soup was good. A little salty, but that's how I crave it. The salad was dry which is impressive considering most Toronto sushi salads are served in their own little swimming pool. There was also red bean ice cream which my usual fave sushi place sadly doesn't have so it was a good surprise.  The food I was served wasn't skimpy. Fish was big on the nigiri and seemed fresh. Spicy mayo was ACTUALLY spicy, needed a sip of water after eating it. LOVE that. Tempura sauce was another surprise. I'm guilty of sometimes dipping my fried treasures in soy at other places because the sauce is bland and I love me some sodium, but the sauce here was awesome. The karaage was pretty much identical to Guu's only all you can eat. I approve.   I can't find anything to hate. A longer menu would be nice but I understand that would drive the price up. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is one of the better sushi places I've been to. It's in a good area - not too far from downtown, not too far from my lovely Finch station.   In the summer you can sit on the patio and they have cheap(er) Sapporo which is a big plus since that beer is 'spensive errywhere else.  My most most most favorite thing (s) about Sushi-O were the squid tentacles. It was kind of like calamari but not really, they were dipped in some kind of light tempura coating and fried to per-fish-ction!   The sushi (maki rolls, I don't actually like sushi sushi - if I wanted to eat rice I would stay home. If i want to eat a piece of raw salmon, I'll order sashimi. I don't understand the point of having a piece of rice with a piece of fish, when you can just have the fish and enjoy is twice as much. rant over! moving on.) were a-ok. The rice around it seemed very stiff and very \"square looking\"... does that make sense? It was too tightly wrapped, and there was only one outter layer of rice. So it made me feel like they pre-make these rice rolls with empty holes and then just stuff the fish inside, assembly line style.  The service was really slow the last time we came, portions were super small. Squid tempura rings were kind of tiny also :(  I do think that if you're in the area and craving sushi, this may be one of the better places to go. They have 10% discount days (i think Tuesday or Thursday) and get pretty busy around lunch dinner so make a rezzie!!"}
{"text":"I used to be a loyal customer for years...including when it was called sushi eaton. Needless to say I have vowed not to return. Not only has their service gone downhill (staff don't speak English, the wait is unnecessarily long, they didn't even bring cutlery or water last time) but the sushi is just beyond bad. They mass produce them and fill everything with mostly rice. To disguise the lack of freshness, they smother overly thing with cheap sweet sauce. The dragon rolls were terrible, and the shrimp tempera on the inside was sauggy. Also I noticed they only have a conditional pass from the health inspectors. It's a shame given the location and the size of the restaurant. :/"}
{"text":"First and only visit.  The service was deplorable and does not make up for the fact that the food was decent and cheap.  Myself and my friend ordered a bento box which contained a whole bunch of hot food (teriyaki, rice, tempura, etc) plus 3 pieces of salmon sushi and 3 pieces of cucumber sushi.  A good deal at $10!  But then things start to go awry: - The hot food arrives and we eat it.  Not bad at all.  But oddly no sushi. - The server comes to take our plates, or boxes actually.  I ask her what happened to the sushi.  She seems shocked and asked if we didn't got it.  I tell her that she only brought us the hot food.  She apologizes and leaves. -  15 minutes later a different server drops off a small plate holding 3 pieces of salmon sushi and 3 pieces of cucumber sushi, without saying a word.  Ummmm....there's 2 of us, remember?  We both ordered the same thing, we both didn't get our sushi.  We split it, realizing that nothing else is coming. - We wait.  And wait.  I eventually wave down our server and ask for the bill.  She asks how we would like to pay.  I tell her \"credit\".  She leaves. - We wait.  And wait.  She brings the bill and drops it off.  I put my credit card out on the table. - We wait.  She never comes back.  I wave her down again and ask if I can pay.  She asks how I would like to pay!  Ummmm...\"same way as I did when you asked me 15 minutes ago\"....no, that would be rude, I simply tell her \"credit\".  She says \"Oh, I'll go get the machine.\"  - We wait some more.  She serves some people their food.  She goes in the back for a bit.  Then she brings the machine and we pay and escape."}
{"text":"Okay, this is a Homer Simpson review. I think it's the only four-star in the bunch. But I can justify it, nothing was so terribly wrong as to merit two stars off, and the food was really excellent.  My husband and I and three friends went for the Tuesday night dinner, which is 20% off. The place was packed. The decor is standard mellow dark-wood Japanese restaurant style, and very comfortable. Largely accessible without stairs, although the bathroom sink requires some contortions to avoid getting wet even if you're standing on your feet. Oh, artsy plumbers, I love and hate you.  This is not a buffet. You get a menu and a checklist at the table, and you write down how many you want of which items and give it to the waitstaff. Then they bring the stuff out. It's all made fresh, which is why some things are slow (anything tempura) and others are speedy (sashimi). Hint: don't order from the appetizer list first! Most of those items are cooked and will take longer. Make sure your first list has lots of sashimi and sushi on it so that you aren't sitting and waiting for the appetizers like we did. I wasn't expecting everything to be made fresh to order (come on, it's AYCE!) and if I had I would have figured that out beforehand.  In general the service was slow but very friendly and helpful. If it's slow it was either because the food was taking so long (which is a very good reason!) or because there just weren't enough staff for all the tables.   Okay, the food. I am a sushi n00b -- this was my first time in a sushi restaurant since I started eating meat again. I'd never had sashimi. My first bite was a very pretty slice of salmon and then some white tuna, and I was impressed. How can fish taste better raw than cooked? The tempura items were perfect, crispy and hot. The rolls are very artfully done, with just the right proportions of quality ingredients. My favourite was probably the Crispy Boston roll -- rice and fish with nori around it, then fried tempura-style, and topped with tobiko and hot sauce. I wish there was a more detailed menu so that I could tell exactly what kind of fish was in the rolls. I can't remember everything we got, but it was all perfect. Finish off with the tempura banana. Ours came with maple syrup rather than the described chocolate sauce, and was really excellent.  Oh wait. There was one item that was not perfect. Did I mention I'm a n00b at sushi? I ordered 'crab sashimi', which turned out to be neither crab nor sashimi. It was those precooked minced-pollock sticks, or as we call them in my family, krab-with-a-k. Well, they charge you extra for anything you order and don't eat, so we ate the krab. Just don't order anything with crab in it and you're fine.  There's a little soup-and-salad bar that you can nosh from between plates, if you want. It's mediocre. Order lots of sashimi and you won't be waiting too long between your plates. The one thing on the bar that was worth going for was the ice cream -- a cooler full of Japanese-style flavours like green tea, red bean, and ginger.   The $3.99 pint can of Sapporo (which apparently is made in Guelph for the North American market) is the perfect thing to sip between sushi plates.  I'll definitely be back for more of this."}
{"text":"One of my co-workers is a chef, and he recommended this place to our team for lunch and we all enjoyed it very much.  For $9.95 we got their lunch special, which includes 1 fancy roll: red dragon, green dragon, spider, spicy salmon etc. , 1 plain roll: cucumber, avocado or egg, a puny appetizer: endamame, 2 gyozas, etc. and unlimited miso soup, salad and ice cream.  I think the unlimited soup, salad and ice cream completely made this worth while.  Their salad bar didn't have much but most japanese places just have lettuce and dressing in their salad anyway.  The ice cream flavours that they had were ginger, mango, green tea, red bean and my favourite, black sesame!  Usually, the same price at other sushi restaurants will get you a bento box lunch and you'll be lucky to get the ice cream with it.  I've only been here once but I highly recommend their lunch special."}
{"text":"Ok this review related specifically to lunch  The positives first: - It has a patio - The salad dressing is nice (gingery, garlicy and orangey) - The $9.95 lunch special is good value (soup, salad, 6 maki of your choice, one main of your choice which could be green,red,eel dragon, etc).  The negatives: - The food is not good. at all.  - The all you can eat option is worthless because nothing good is on the menu - The options keep decreasing with time. Salad bar reduced to one choice - Service is bad  But they have a patio. You decide. I'm not going back."}
{"text":"I just had lunch here and have rarely been so impressed by a restaurant's service. We actually arrived 20 minutes before they opened, but the man at the in front insisted on serving us anyway.  During the meal ($10 all-you-can-eat!), we were continually asked how everything was. We received our food quite fast and were satisfied with everything. They even include dim sum on the menu, which was a nice surprise.  From our seat on the patio we could see the greeters handing out free sushi samples to passers-by. It's incredible the effort they put into this restaurant.  If you want good, reasonably-priced sushi with what I'd say is exceptional service, you should definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"While the ALL YOU CAN EAT banner out front must have been like a sign from God for those hungry hungry sushi-files, we walked into Sushi O out of convenience and were therefore likely the only table ordering a la carte. The bright and spacious dining room was packed on this late weeknight. The server seemed to be both surprised and relieved that we only wanted one dish each.   Our large dishevelled green salads and piping hot miso soup came straight away from the buffet station. Our matching chirashi dons arrived soon after with a fair assortment of sashimi (and pleasantly sweetened tamago) atop huge bowls of rice that neither one of us could finish.  Although the servers seemed to be quite flustered, frisbeeing around monster sized platters of mish-mashed AYCE orders, the service we received was not bad at all.  The women's bathroom was a problem though. It was so flooded in there, it was pretty much impossible to side step the mini pond. Gross."}
