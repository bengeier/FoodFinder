{"text":"I liked this place, because of the location and the fact that I was able to get a table right away (midweek, lunch time).  The view was great, the food was good (but very pricey) and the atmosphere was relaxed.  I was in the mood for seafood and wanted to eat on the Harbourfront, and was expecting to pay a little more for the location.  

I paid more than anticipated (about $70 including $10 tip) and while the food was good, I think $19 for shrimp cocktail is a little ridiculous considering I got 5 pieces.  The service was somewhat disappointing, considering it was relatively slow and there were 3-4 waiters serving 6-7 tables of 2.  But they were friendly and my seafood casserole dish was tasty, so I would probably come back."}
{"text":"No free refills?  

Pretty standard practice now a days to have free refills; would have been nice to mention to us after our 3rd refill.

Food was ok, but it was more expensive than other places.  Music was stuck on 90s pop.  It's been a while since I listened to boys to men...

I wouldn't go back.  If I wanted average pub food, I would go to the watermark."}
{"text":"Tourist bar along the lakefront.   Many sea-faring artifacts adorn the walls even though its on a lake.  I was just here to drink.  No feed back on the feed.  
Bartender was friendly and answered all our questions about touring Toronto.  Quick service though we did sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Being my first visit to Toronto I don't know of many places to go near the waterfront. This is not a bad place to visit if you're a tourist trying to see the waterfront. There is plenty of outdoor seating if the weather is nice out. 

I will say that I ordered only an appetizer because the meals were way overpriced. Even the apps are too much. I also was not impressed with the size of the appetizer I ordered or the quality of the food. So, I'm going to say that you can probably eat dinner somewhere better.

I would say this is the type of place to hop in for a beer or a drink just to see the atmosphere. I think there are too many excellent places to pick from in Toronto to eat at.

Overall- this isn't the best I've been to."}
{"text":"Another tourist trap on the harbor front. I am very disappointed by the fact that Toronto lacks good restaurants near the harbor front. 

There was no service here (we waited close to 30 minutes for a waiter to arrive - even though the place had about only 10 full tables). 

Tacky theme decor (sailors, anchors, fish ... everywhere). 

The food itself was decent, otherwise I would have given it a 2 star. I had the Tuscan pizza and my dining partner had a burger with fries. Although the food is far from inventive and very expected, it was decent."}
{"text":"Tourist trap, and anti-customer to boot. How disappointing to find a restaurant like this in an area so heavily trafficked by locals and tourists.

Yes, it has a great location, but the food is average and the service even worse. The day we were there, we asked for something on the patio. The hostess said they didn't have anything available. We said we would gladly wait, and the hostess looked confused/irritated and said they don't do that. Um. Don't do what? Would they have rather we lurked around the patio like it was a food court until someone got up? Who was it really hurting to have us wait at the front or at the bar for a few minutes? The dining areas inside were largely empty.

We left, but not two minutes later, saw a table for four open up on the patio and went back. But we all wished we hadn't. Once seated, we learned there was an $8 minimum food order per person, so we couldn't just sit back and have a pint as planned. Really??? I'm ashamed to say that we broke down and each ordered something small rather than leave. And of COURSE the food was mediocre at best. Of course it was.
 
You know, I hate to say this, but you couldn't pay me to go back. Reminds me of a lot of the restaurants at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. That's not a good thing."}
{"text":"Seriously, how difficult is it to get a decent burger?  What could possibly be less complicated?

The \"lighter fare\" wing to the Pier 4 Storehouse restaurant in the Harbourfront area, Wallymagoo's boasts having \"the world's greatest pizza,\" and by the ships-ahoy looks of the place, I'd expect it to have decent seafood.  But when I visited, all I was looking for was a basic, standard cheeseburger, and I was totally turned off.  

Yes, the place is big.  Yes, it looks like it could be fun.  Yes, the yuppie Queen's Quay set seem to like watching their golf games on the huge TV while sipping their foo-foo drinks.  Yes, it's conveniently attached to other well-reputed eateries in the Queen's Quay tourist mecca.

But, c'mon, how hard is it to screw up a cheeseburger, dude?

For the vibe of the place and the price, I expected a burger made from fresh ground beef.  Nope, this was from the same variety of oval-shaped, thin, store-bought patty of processed filler that I could easily get myself at the local No Frills.  Also, the side of fries seemed like a ridiculously small serving for the price.

With the nice table linen, the handsome services, the cute doily under my pot of tea, this less-than-mediocre fare seemed like an crime.  My plate mocked me, laughing in my face about the $11 I was going to shell out for this abomination of a cheeseburger.

Wait.  Did I say cheeseburger?  My mistake, I received a hamburger.  Ok, sez I to the server, just bill me for a hamburger instead.  Aren't I nice?  Server guy apologizes.  

The bill arrives.  Cheeseburger price remains.  

They forgot food quality.  They forgot the cheese.  They forgot to adjust the bill.  I forgot to leave a tip."}
{"text":"Toronto's Harbourfront is amazing & this is a great spot for a beer and a snack on a warm sunny day."}
{"text":"When will Yelp add the coveted half a star rating? If ever a place deserved it...

Typical bad tourist food with a dash of bad attitude. Do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere."}
