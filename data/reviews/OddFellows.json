{"text":"I have been meaning to go to Oddfellows for quite some time now. Never really made it out because my usual dinner partner is not a fan of the communal table. Finally made it out on Friday with a large group. The service was great and I had the amazing pork belly ribs. I also tried the flat-iron steak, thanks to a pal, and I was just as impressed. I hear that the breakfast is dope too, but I'll have to check back on that.

Post dinner, the entire group basically hung our and drank until closing and we were always treated with the utmost respect and I honestly cannot wait to go back. The beers were also pretty inexpensive, all considered. I honestly cannot wait to go back, eat some pork belly and a drink a bunch of $3.50 PBRs! 

Thanks Oddfellows for hosting a fantastic bachelor party."}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday having never heard of the place and was down right impresses. When she told me there was only one table I was a bit skeptical but upon arrival I realized how fabulously communal and European it was. The music was great, they even played my fav Bone Thugs N Harmony song, \"First of The Month\"  oh yeah...! Beyond that the drinks were reasonably priced, $5 rails and $8 house wine and the service was great. The food is definitely on the expensive with most entrees hovering around $20, however everyone loved what they ordered and didn't complain about the price once their plates were cleaned. Well worth the extra money for an awesome, unique night out!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, with a number of vegetarian options on the menu (oh, the tempeh stew--perfect for a cold night!).  Don't sit at the far end of the table, though--with all the beautiful windows in this place, it can get pretty drafty, so the further you are from the fireplace, the colder it is.  

The close quarters make it easy to chat up people you don't know, but when the place is full, it's hard to carry on a conversation--it's easier to hear the stranger seated next to you than your date across the table!  On the other hand, having friendly strangers next to you does make it easy to ditch a date that's going badly (not that I'd do that! Just, you know, it's an option.)"}
{"text":"From first glance, there is nothing going on here. On a funny corner, surrounded by Style Garage and CAMH, it looks like an abandoned building, perhaps an artist's space. Step inside though and you're welcomed into a communal dining experience that I initially found off-putting, but warmed to.

My friend had been before, and I was taking him for his birthday, so trusting his foodie sense, I was excited. The long communal table made me hungry as our neighbors food arrived while we were waiting, hungry - it did help me decide what I wanted to order though!

I had the pork ribs, an unusual choice for me, and I loved every bite. There wasn't a bad thing to say about the food at all. The staff was fast enough, the one guy I remember as vacant stare man from the Victory Café and he lived up to my memories. At least he was on top of his game here. 

After dinner when I was more in the mood for dessert, it was a bit weird to smell the stew a few seats away from us. A slight downside to the communal concept, but at the same time it was fun to share the experience with others and watch them dig in.

Only one real lame point to me which was the effort that went into small things (not the décor though, that was fantastic!). The food is worth every pretty penny it costs, but you'd think they'd have a real soap dispenser, or would serve drinks in a way that would make them also appealing. I can't stand when a place cheaps out on the small things, thinking their food will make up for it. To each their own though!

I must go back after dinner hours for $3 grilled cheese because I love to scour the city for the best."}
{"text":"The only reason I give it 4 stars over 5 is the lack of apps. But the food and service was awesome. Loved sharing the table, although we lucked out with an end so maybe it changed the vibe a little bit. The staff were great and didn't get judgy when we were having a little too much fun (you know how easy that bottle of wine can go down). And I didn't even mentiontje decor! Simple but quirky, don't try to act to cool for that fireplace.  It's my go to date restaurant right now."}
{"text":"Dale M: I'll take a Delirium or whatever's on tap.

They were out of Delirium and the tap for Erdinger was broken. He had to settle for a tall boy of Steigl which was served in its can.

Kat F: I'll have a spiked lemonade. I know they have that.

Nope.

Kat F: OK, then, I'll have a Hendrick's and grapefruit.

Denied again. No Hendrick's, just Bombay gin.

At this point, I wasn't even going to be picky. I settled for whatever vodka they had plus an over-dousing of tonic water.

Later on, Kat F's attempt to order a brownie sundae also proved futile. 

Do Oddfellows and Prohibition in Leslieville share the same slacker inventory manager? I want to like these places but it's frustrating when they keep running out of stuff.

We finished our drinks and left quickly before the DJ put on another Merle Haggard record.

Still, I might go back for their $15-AYCE-wings night* on Sunday. That is, if they don't run out of food.

*Actually, call the restaurant to find out what they're serving for their AYCE nights. Their website is not updated."}
{"text":"This place is fun fun fun.  Not for the faint of heart as the music blasts, the conversation and drinks flow, and the flavours can be intense.  But when it comes to weekend dining that is just what I'm looking for.  

As though it's a little oasis of foreign soil, it's a great place for random conversation with your neighbour (not Toronto's specialty).

The amazing stew-for-two feeds at least three, and I find that it attracts characters of all ages and types, so you'll be dining with some built in entertainment.  One of my go-tos.

I'm withholding the 5th star ONLY because the brunch is middling (though the atmosphere still brings me out)"}
{"text":"I thought it was funny when the restaurant first opened and prominently highlighted its communal table. (Insert eye roll here). I met a friend here for dinner and had a very mediocre meal. The servers all screamed \"art-school college students\"; it was hard for us to get their attention because they were too busy dealing with their own sense of entitlement. Maybe the management should spend more time on figuring out how to deliver quality service and food, rather than maintaining their Williamsburg-esque \"mystique.\""}
{"text":"After a afternoon of slinging back tall cans with friends in Trinity Bellwoods park on a hot summer day, naturally we were looking for food to absorb all the booze.  Oddfellows was suggested by a friend and we were sold.

The place is cozy and i love the minimalistic decor with a few choice pieces around the place.  I love the communal cafeteria style table right in the middle of the room.  That being said you might have to wait a while on a busy night due to the small amount of seats.

On to the food.......I ordered the Vegan Stew.  It was hands down one of the tastiest meals I had in my life.  I had to refrain myself from licking the bowl.  The menu itself will please anyone.  My friends ordered the quail, the tempeh club and the pork butt.  There was a really good variety of food for everyone.

The service was good, they played good punk rock music which prompted a couple of quiet singalongs.  The only draw back is  that is some of the meals were on the pricey side, but it's well worth saving up and treating your tummy to some good good food."}
{"text":"On my second visit here, I have to say that the overall \"experience\" here actually dragged OddFellows' rating down to a measly 3 stars. It is a happy median between 4-star quality food, but 2-star everything else.

By \"everything else\", I mean service, overheating your customers, and a general snootiness that I guess comes with Castor territory. We called about 5 days in advance to book a table for that Friday evening, and they informed us that had to make up our mind about the precise number of seats (we told them 6 for sure, possible 7), otherwise we were out of luck. Hm, okay... Apparently they were to be so busy that not a single chair could go wasted. Also, we were informed that we could only stay until 9 pm. Um, fine.

Upon our arrival we were surprised to see that we were the only ones at the table (there were a couple of people out on the patio), and to our dismay, despite the scorching weather, there was no AC, not even a fan in sight. It was so hot that we all sweated through the entire meal, and one of our party even had to go out and get air to keep from passing out. For the two hours that we were there the entire row of tables remained empty, save for a couple people who sauntered in, only to saunter back out (heat? kicked out because they didn't have reservations?). After all that reservation hubbub, it looked like it was all much ado about nothing.

Service - not friendly, but we were serviced well enough. My friend did request salad dressing on the side, which didn't happen. A small slip-up.

Food, on the other hand, is excellent (albeit a little pricey for what it is). I enjoyed the tempeh sandwich (huge! enough for two people), which normally comes with a side of fries, but they obliged to my 1/2 fries-1/2 salad request. Yes, I'm one of those people. Delicious, and to my surprise, the salad was perhaps the star of the dish. Dressed with what seemed to be dried blueberries, among other goodies, the salad was outstanding, summery, and unique. 

I've heard great things about their brunch, perhaps it may be busier which could help with the atmosphere. And if only they could just get over themselves."}
{"text":"The perfect place for a fall date! 

I'd been in the summer and remember enjoying the steak tartare and mussels - clearly I'd forgotten (or not taken advantage of) the beautiful contemporary fireplace that hangs from the ceiling... or the long communal table and stemless wine glasses (stems are so fou-fou sometimes no?)

We started with the fried pork belly and kimchi and it was just as good as it sounds. My date called his burger 'the best he's ever had', I had some fish which I didn't especially like, but that has not tarnished my opinion of this place in the slightest... sometimes you order the wrong thing...and sometimes your date orders something so spectacular that it makes anything and everything else pale in comparrison...

Still must make a point to try brunch."}
{"text":"This had all the makings of a great dinner. Cool space with magnetic walls, a gorgeous hanging fireplace, a single long communal table, interesting menu ranging from vegan to carnivore and plaid plaid galore. As soon as I walked in I felt like I'd stumbled upon some sort of space/time warp and ended up in Williamsburg on Queen St. Unfortunately, as prefaced by the star rating...Oddfellows proved the old adage, \"Don't judge a book by it's cover.\"

The lovely Kat F. had made us reservations at 9pm and strolling in two minutes before I was greeted with the small space, a full table and little bar seats to wait in. The frazzled bartender cum waiter looked a bit horrified when we told him we were here for our 9pm reservation and he told us to \"sit back and have a drink, those two are just about to leave\". Ok. I asked for a Greyhound. He replied, \"What's a Greyhound?\" Alright, so this guy's not a bartender. Kat asks about their spiked lemonade and after rifling around in a dirty floor fridge for a bit he brings out a plastic jug of pink sludge and says, \"We have some...juice.\" Ick. I ask about the grapefruit for the Greyhound and he comes up for air with another dubious jug of concentrate and I concede and ask for Hendrick's which he denies they have until I point out the bottle on the shelf. This whole scene at a dive bar? Fine acceptable. But it was pretty ludicrous at a restaurant that charges $25 an entree to be served something you'd drink at a house party at 4am when everyone stops caring that the juice is expired and who knows where the booze came from. 

After continuing to wait, the time crept to 9:35 and we decided to order our food so that when we were seated we'd dive right in. 9:50 came around and after watching a homeless crazy do a round poking at diners before being thrown out, the frazzled guy kicks out the couple nursing their empty beer glasses that had been busy trying to decide whose glasses are more ironic. He puts plates of food at the seats and as an afterthought says, \"Oh, yeah you guys can go sit down now if you want.\" Thanks?

I ordered the salad, mysterious \"cream sauce\" on the side. It was, of course, soaked in said cream sauce but my hunger overpowered. I mostly gravitated toward the croutons as the iceberg lettuce was a bit...chewy. As an entree I had the pork pelly, rabbit and fig compote. I was mostly attracted to the pork belly but it came out...cold. Blech. Word to the wise, never eat cold pork belly...imagine chewing on layers of cold bacon fat. The rabbit stuff could be best described as tuna salad...it was the best tasting thing on the plate though so I gobbled up the mystery goo. Then there was a fig compote that was just a ridiculous addition as it was so potent that I couldn't figure out how it was supposed to compliment the bland meet piles. Kat insisted we go for the brownie a la mode to save our meal and that truly was a gooey hot \"forgive us\" though my patience was beyond tested at that point. 

Perhaps it was an off night but I can't imagine how this place survives. The other diners at our long communal table seemed to all be friends with the owner and kept walking in and out of the kitchen and stoking the fireplace etc. It was like being at a dinner party where we didn't know the hosts or the other guests yet tried to be polite about the food even though nobody's really asking you if you like it anyway."}
{"text":"Oddfellows has a unique charm about it.  Despite waiting a crazy amount of time to have our order taken and then to get our food I found the place relaxed me when normally I would have been getting the early morning low-blood sugar and caffeine-withdrawal rage.  We did come when it was jammed and every spot at the long table was filled but it is a small place. Waiting patiently, I found myself drooling over my neighbours plates of nearly finished food.  When we got our hearty and healthy looking eggs benny (but with asparagus and tomatoes) I was both pleased (the veggies were awesome) and displeased (eggs were overcooked and on the cold side).  If I'd only had coffee in this cool and kooky place I would've given it 5 stars - it was the best cup of coffee I've had in years.  Deee-licious!"}
{"text":"Oddfellows: Good drinks, good music and good vibes.  

I stumbled upon OddFellows during a midnight jaunt along Queen Street West and was pleasantly surprised to find a bar in Toronto with a very 'NYC'- artistic laid back vibe. It is the vibe that somehow inspires creative thought without actually doing anything in specific to provoke this thought. 

Also, the small room off to the side of the patio is a perfect spot for a portable midnight art project with a friend and a beer."}
{"text":"This brings life to Queen West dining / entertainment. The place is actually owned and operated by a design group - Castro Design.

This is why this place looks and feels as if your in a modern / Eco / wilderness type social environment. Its simply amazing.
I happened to get there after dinner was served, but had just an amazing experience.
What I like best is the people. I truly believe the people that visit the bar get the concept, and create an atmosphere that is open and inviting. You do not get that from many places in the city.

I heard the venison burger is amazing, so I will definitely have to go back.
One more thing - call ahead for reservations!"}
{"text":"We came for brunch. Three of us. It took

One. Hour. to get food. 

From when we were seated, to food on the table. Not counting the wait for being seated.

Ok, it was Sunday at noon. And the place was reasonably busy - but considering that it's actually pretty small, they might need to hire another chef or a helper or something.

The food was definitely tasty, with a short menu that respected both carnivores & vegetarians without fuss. Coffee was very good & strong, with refills.

Not overly generous portions (especially after waiting so long). No substitutions (I guess that's a policy? or maybe it was specific to that day, or to me.. I didn't ask for anything fancy, but my request was rejected \"no\"  no statement or explanation

Definitely a lot of attitude. I don't expect sucking up, but meeting requests with a flat \"no.\" and nothing else, rather than \"I'm sorry\" or an explanation is off-putting. Especially after waiting for so long, and paying a good amount for not a lot of food."}
{"text":"Even with a late dinner reservation, our party of 7 still had to wait a bit for room at the table, (and there was one group that hadn't finished eating when we arrived and loitered for at least an hour after!) but other than that, the place was great.

I had been to Oddfellows once before and remembered it being good, but this time the food was even better. Delicious appetizer of pork belly (big enough to share - lots of food!), and I followed with the brisket burger which was OMFG good. Really tender and generous, I couldn't finish, and not for lack of trying,

Wine was good, service was nice and friendly. The place has a cool eclectic vibe, from the staff, to the decor and menu, to the other patrons. It's an interesting place to have a very tasty meal. Go hungry."}
{"text":"The exterior of the place isn't much, actually it's very easy to miss as there is no sign outside. The only thing that gives this place away is the long communal table on the inside barely visible from outside. The communal table is an interesting concept and one that works. I've been here several times and always end up talking to new people, a very rare feet in Toronto. I'm sure many unexpected good times are had at this very long marble table and new friends made. The artwork inside is very interesting with foam heads red taped to chains, antler headphones, light fixtures made of various light bulbs, and the giant magnetic board is also a nice touch. The patio is covered by an army camo tarp and is just another quirky addition to the already eclectic decor.

The service here is great! The servers are very friendly, knowledgeable, and personable. It feels as if they are old friends. Pairing suggestions are great and they are also pretty good and food suggestions too. Saturday and Friday nights are very busy and the bartender is working away at cocktails and the cook staff are rammed but the servers keep their cool and collected and handle everything with ease.

Food here is very good. Although the menu is quite small the quality of food is quite spectacular. They have something covered for herbivores and omnivores alike. If you are a picky eater though, you may want to look elsewhere as the choices are fairly limited. I find it better to have a smaller menu as it helps me choose as the options are already narrowed down.

Overall, it's always a fun time out when at Oddfellows as long as your are with the right people. Come with people that are open to meeting new people and don't mind sitting in a table full of strangers, they also can't be too picky an eater. If you have a few friends like this then they'll love it here. If not, then you'll meet them here. Food is good and prices are reasonable. Hard to not like this little hidden gem."}
{"text":"I first tried this place in 2008 when it first opened and I was floored.  The friendly atmosphere created by the long harvest table, and the simple yet sophisticated gasto-cuisine created the perfect meal.  It was also a great cross section of people - the post-work office crowd, local artsies, and older clientele.  At that first visit I had their Buffalo meatloaf which was truly bliss on that cold March night.

Summer brunch at OF was also quite good - their Breakfast for Two was a tad spicy, and very large, but on a lazy Sunday, with a couple of cups of coffee's, it's a great way to spend an hour on.

That being said, even though my first couple of visits were stellar, I recently went back to see that the restaurant may have lost its way.  On this occasion, inspite of my reservation, I had to wait 20 minutes for my seats to free-up, and was also ushered out around the 1.5 hour mark even though we were still on our mains (the kitchen was EXTREMELY slow).  The food was also average and unimpressive, which capped off some minor changes to their menu items (for the worse).  I'm willing to give this place another chance, maybe on a less volatile evening (it was very busy, I'll give them that), but I really hope that they're not trying to rest on their laurels too much."}
{"text":"Unusual restaurant as suggested by the name.  Yes, everything about it is a bit odd.  I read somewhere it was owned or designed by artists.  The ceiling above the bar is cluttered by various sorts of light bulbs in a sculpture.  The seating was also strange as it was one long table with chairs on both sides and ends.  There was a group of 4 at one end near the window, so we sat at the other end; very reminiscent of high school cafeteria style seating.  Water came in a large Grolsch swing top bottle.  Espresso came in a clear drinking glass.....  This place, I think, is meant to engage your visual senses as much as taste and smell - which scores it a point.  One wall opposite the door is made of metal and littered with everything from alphabetic magnets, to a sculpture of a head with red tape over the eyes and mouth.  I don't know what is with this place and red tape....., but they seem to think it's a charming decorating motif as you'll see it scattered about the restaurant in various areas.  
Brunch menu was quite limited with only 5-7 items to choose from including Omelettes, Buck Wheat cakes with fruit [which I had].  For a breakfast I thought it was rather expensive at $12-16 per plate.  The menu states that for groups 4 or larger they add 15% gratuity.  So don't come here unless you enjoy enforced tipping.

However, despite the weirdness, they definitely knew how to cook.  My waffles were made from healthy whole grain flower: buckwheat!  Combination of blueberries, blackberries, oranges, fried bananas, and whipped cream was lovely.

All in all, I don't think I would return for a second visit primarily because of how unnatural the whole place feels.  No signs for washroom [one shared by all guests], one long table, weird sculptures all around you. 

I should mention they have bench seating outdoors as well, and there are windows on three sides of the room so it's quite bright."}
{"text":"The most interesting restaurant in the city.

Simply gorgeous modern interior design.   Topped by a spendld chandelier over the bar   They wouldn't have to serve any food and the place would still be worth going to.

Communal tables.  A hodgepodge of interesting people from interesting places.   A constantly changing social environment.   Young.  Hip.  Unpretentious.   

A unique menu with plenty of surprises.  Venison.  Wild Boar.  Solent Green.  Grilled Cheese.  Milk.   Seriously.

Erdinger on tap.

A wonderful staff.

No sign.

Don't tell everybody.  Let's try to keep this place quiet."}
{"text":"One of my new fave restaurants in the city.  It's rare to find a place that puts just as much thought into their vegetarian dishes as their meat dishes.  Rare and refreshing.

With no sign out front, and just a menu taped to the window, the first time we walked by this place, we thought it was a private party.  One big long marble table, with people sitting all the way around it, conversing over imported beers and wine.  The communal seating idea is wonderful, and we always meet lovely people and have fantastic conversations over dinner.  You get a real feeling of community, in a city that isn't known for it.  The interior is filled with recycled-bulb light fixtures, a cozy fireplace suspended off the floor, soft-lighting and flickering candles, and interesting wall installations, all worthy of placement in the MOMA.

The \"Herbivore Stew\" and \"Veggie Pasta\" on the menu changes every week from my experience, which means there's always something new and exciting to try.  One of the best things I had there was a pasta dish with a tomato and butternut squash sauce, and pumpkin seed pesto with shaved cheese on top.  The duck pate, served with honey and nuts, is beyond description.  The wild boar or venison burgers are rightfully popular.

I've eaten there a few times now, and the staff always remember us, and our favourite dishes.  The chefs are always around to give feedback to, and seem to really appreciate it and take it seriously, as they constantly are developing new dishes.  It's great to speak to everyone around the table and hear their thoughts on the food they're eating.  I've even seen young families walk in with their kids!!

You MUST make sure you have room to try the brownie after your meal.  Life is not complete without it.  After dinner hours, they offer drinks and $3 grilled cheese until close.  I've also heard good things about their brunch and all-you-can-eat Grazing Mondays spread.  Couldn't have imagined a better restaurant myself.  Best kept secret in the city."}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday here last week. A great place, with positive energy and fantastic food. I had a steak and fries and before I even got to touch my plate, my friends dove into my food. Always a good sign! Great for groups but you have to put it on your credit card. 

Overall.. a little gem on Queen West."}
{"text":"A weird but interesting place is OddFellows. It's a unique place because there's only one table in the restaurant. It's one huge long table, and your group could be sitting next to strangers. It's fun, but the atmosphere is a little dark. The food is pretty good and they have some good imported and old beers. The bison burger there is amazing and generally, it's pretty cheap too. It's a nice place to go if you are going out on Queen Street for drinks after. I think it's a good place for groups, but the service is pretty bad. But me an my friends go back just for the bison burger. I would make a reservation if possible, but it's not usually that busy. I heard a rumour that they were moving, so call before you go. http://www.oddfellows.ca/"}
{"text":"Erdinger and Delirium - those are your options you will get when you ask what's on tap at Oddfellows. If you care about stuff like that, you will also be delighted that they are each served in their appropriate extra tall or pink elephant adorned glasses. 

As with the drinks, the food menu has obviously also been carefully curated. I had the calamari ($8.95) which came on a darling dish served with capers. It was on the saltier than normal side and wouldn't have been enough to share as a starter, but was perfect for nibbling in between sips of my gigantic wheat beer. 

The long communal table is interesting to sit at, but makes for segregated conversations if you come with a larger group. I've heard that the minimalist layout serves as a great casual venue for drinks come the night."}
{"text":"Found this little restaurant on a mini trip to Toronto - This place is great! Very friendly people working, we had the stew for 2 which was super delicious. The chicken pate to start was also very tasty. Unfortunately didn't get to try dessert but overall, this is an awesome place to try! excellent ambiance and decor as well."}
{"text":"The last few times I've brought friends here I've been a bit embarrassed by my own advance raves of the place. Inattentive, elitist \"all my friends hang out here so I'll serve them first\" attitudes are cute at first glance, but get boring after a few visits. The last three times I've eaten here they were out of everything I wanted to order - alcohol, dinner and dessert. Worth a visit, but beware the attitude."}
{"text":"Brunch Review. Went with Wendy H.

Delicious food between 9-15 dollars.

Expect a great brunch, fun mugs, hipsters, and everyone sits at one table. Be comfortable with sitting next to strangers.

I enjoyed the atmosphere, the food, the brightness. I ate, and then get the hell outta dodge when the uber hipsters arrived, making me feel like a suit.

go. enjoy. report back."}
