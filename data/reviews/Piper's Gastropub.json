{"text":"1 out of 5! The food is horrible and house wine is disgusting! Do not recommend it"}
{"text":"Secretly hidden among the shops at the Royal York Fairmount Hotel stands Piper's. Do you like dark beer?  Well, all the brews at Piper's are dark since the lights are barely on.   After-work crowds gather here for happy hour.  It closes too early though.  Coming back to our hotel after a day/night of drinking we wanted to have just one more round.  It was midnight and Piper's had already closed at 11pm.  Huh?  (Plan B: Go back out to Front Street) Review is not for the food since we were strictly getting our drink on."}
{"text":"Tried it b/c of a wagjag offer. Food is horrible. Worst burger I've had in a long time. Better off going to a truck stop. Shocked that this was the 'royal York''s pub. Closed on the weekends???"}
{"text":"Try the seafood chowder. Truly outstanding. Also very pleasant and professional staff."}
{"text":"My review is for drinks only. I tried to go to \"Pete's Pub\" on a Monday...yes my friend gave me the wrong name but the right location...but they were closed.

Tried again on Tuesday. Yay they're open. We order a round of drinks...my friends get the honey beer...local beer mixed with honey produced by bees that live on the roof of the hotel. And I got an old fashioned with cherry something bitters. It sounded sweet but tasted perfect. We were texting other friends to try to get them to join us when our server came over and told us that actually it was last call as they weren't busy enough to stay open...at 9:30pm.

OK. We started to wrap it up when folks started wandering in from the Blue Jays game but nope. They were closing. 

Oh well."}
{"text":"Located beneath the Fairmont (The Path), located just down the stairs when you come into the main Fairmont doors facing Front.

We ended up at Piper's because we didn't feel dressed up enough for the Fairmont Library Bar. And what a pleasant surprise, considering it's really hidden away!

Only open till 11:30pm, Mon-Fri, so beware - but this is a great casual place to grab a drink. They have that one-step-up beer menu including Mill Street Organic & Steamwhistle on tap. Regular prices, big sports tv, high bar tables as well as comfy bench seats and tables. 

The staff was super friendly AND (I love this), they offer a complementary peanut/pretzel/wasabi ball dish! Spicy, but nice pairing for a drink!"}
{"text":"Very dark inside.  Lots of TVs so you can enjoy a game.  The food was good, nothing super special, but did the job.  I thought they were a little expensive for what they serve.  I did like that the menu offered to pair a beer with a specific menu item!  Very cool."}
{"text":"This is a below average pub IMO. I guess they are somewhat guaranteed business by being located in the hotel. The beer selection is just mainstream brands with some promos thrown in. I was taken aback by the prices of wine to tell you the truth but they explained they have to follow the rules for those given out by the hotel.
Now for the main I had the signature burger. Mundane and the side of sweet potato fries in the same bandwagon. The other diners commented that their food was below average as well.
Service was OK. They do show a lot of sports so if you just want average grub and pints this might be your ticket. 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Suggested by a comely young hostess in the Fairmont as her \"favorite bar\" in the hotel, Piper's may have been positioned to disappoint from the onset. Frankly, it was a dim, lifeless dungeon beset by fried food and an epically unimaginative concept. With so many great choices nearby, stay above ground!"}
{"text":"I worked nearby for a number of years, and this was often my go-to place for a casual dinner and a pint. Service was always quick. Salmon was my favorite dish. Not a huge menu, but did the job. Beer during happy hour was very reasonable. I actually like the dark atmosphere. There are lots of people watching sports on the huge projector, so its not a quiet place but crazy loud either."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had a nice experience. The bartender was friendly and attentive without being nosy and without lingering too long, which is an under appreciated quality.
Ordered 2 delicious pints with an order of poutine. We are tourists after all.
Local pints were delicious with the salty poutine. 
It was too large to finish"}
{"text":"Really 3.5 stars.  This is primarily a bar with a full menu thanks to the hotel link.  The surroundings are definitely English style with a  lot of wood, the selections are nice and the food is quite ok.  One of the less expensive restaurants in site (the food is all the same, just priced differently).  The meal was standard fare with the protein, greens and starch setup.  Not the best I have had but quite acceptable.  They have different dinner specials daily with exception to Sat - they are closed."}
{"text":"We came here during our stay at Fairmont. The style is typical pub, but the food is delicious. We ordered bruschetta, the portobello burger and the blackened chicken burger with a side of sweet potato fries! 

The burgers were both amazing. The chicken burger was quite large and I struggled through eating it all, but, I tried because it was so delicious! My boyfriends portobello burger he said was very good! 

Would recommend for a casual dining experience! :)"}
