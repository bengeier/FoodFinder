{"text":"Terrible maintenance department! They did not get permission to do the work, then charged a ridiculous amount, and the boat did not work!  Reviewing the parts charging they double charged us for several parts, then after they claimed to have fixed it - we found eve more parts double charged.  After a second trip back the boat still didn't work.  Stay away from the service department!"}
{"text":"This place looks really great, but that is where it ends with regard to treating customers well. In short, lots of pressure with regard to a boat purchase, lack of knowledge when dealing with the parts/service department, and generally abysmal service on all fronts when looking for help (Jes and the lady at the front desk providing water excluded). It is almost like they do not want customers, or at least long term, repeat customers. I could write a short story regarding my experience with this place, but it is really not worth my time. If someone from this company wants to contact me to get any clarification or help better my experience, feel free to reach out."}
{"text":"I went in to look at the boats given i just moved to tge area and had my prom once upon a time so while i was there i figured i would inquire about a bartending position .....it was around 1030...being Ive worked in the service industry for over 15 years I understand and empathize with those servers just getting off a double....youre exhausted yes.....this server of who's name is Marta is apparently the hiring manager . I approached her aplogetticaly  and kindly explained I was wondering if they were hiring. She turned to me as if I just asked her the most appauling question in the world....she fired comments about training already being completed and asked me to list (even with my resume right in front of her) like a drill Sargent all the bars I've worked at ... What bars in Pgh and when was the most recent...if I had my certification (TABC?) . I said no BC of the fifteen years I've bartender I've never even heard of such a thing but she reacted as if I was some sort of phony or liar....I told her I would gladly comply and fill out an application and bring it back BC clearly she was having a bad day and maybe it would be better to start fresh trying to give her the benefit of the doubt .... I am not one for confrontation and she said well if you've been here for over ten hours you would be like this too....I even tried to make a joke saying I've been there and I would be a bitch too....she ran back threw the application at me and I said you have to excuse me my mother just passed away and I don't really want to deal with any drama and she told me that I shouldn't be a bitch to the hiring manager.....at that point I was stunned that this was even happening the way it was as I myself am a non confrontational person and truly respect and empathize as I've said with those in the industry....this girl Marta looked at me with zero compassion and a sense of entitlement  and said you wanna talk to the manager I'll get him for you before I even had a chance to say anything .... Almost as if she wanted to exert her power....of course the manager told me to get the fuck out of here.....I was at a loss....im baffled that this situation even took place .... I HAVE NEVER taken the time to write a review about anything BC as I said its not worth it most times....this I have to share as I found it insulting upsetting let alone unprofessional... Of course the other parties involved will see it as they want...I couldn't be more hurt is the word that comes to mind....I've dealt with my fair share of difficult people ... We all have bad days...but I always have compassion and respect for people .....I am so appauled that no one I know will EVER step foot in there again.....you don't treat anyone like that...I was pushed to my limit and still the worst I could say as I was pushed out is how heartless they were.....don't expect much from there.....unless you have money ....im sure it would have been a much different situation had I came under different circumstances...its unacceptable and should be known"}
