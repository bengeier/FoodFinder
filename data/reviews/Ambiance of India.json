{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time as it was always just down the street from me. Wanted to try the buffet but missed it so dinner it was! Had fish pakora, butter chicken, paloua rice, garlic naan and ritai(sp?). Everything was good except for the beer haha.. King fisher to be specific. Prices are on the higher side but still reasonable. Next time I will try the buffet"}
{"text":"I was there last night for dinner, I had chicken tikka masala and hubby had chicken vindaloo.  Both were very well cooked, very fresh and tender.  The staff are great.  This is a little gem."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for three. We were horrified at the poor quality of the food. Here are some of the low lights: - Entrees clearly had frozen bagged vegetables in them that were freezer burned. Peas were shriveled and rock hard. Carrots and chopped string beans in the curry were raw and flavorless. We had to pick the veggies out in order to attempt to eat the rest of our entrees. - Naan bread was so undercooked that it was still raw dough. Two orders, totally inedible. - 4 small chunks of chewy lamb swimming in about 4 cups of watery sauce for $16. Poor value to say the least. - Very bland curry flavors in all the dishes, weak spices, not fresh ingredients. - My friends wife was sick during the night. A complete waste of $70, this place gives Indian food a bad name and we will NEVER order from them again. Do your self a favor and go some where else these people clearly don't care about serving you quality food."}
{"text":"I went to Ambiance of India on weekday and the  food and service was good. I'm impressed with their tandoori cook. He really has his technique down. However that day the restaurant was empty, thus the good service. Having had that experience once, I was hoping to be a repeat costumer. When I went today, I walked in at 8:02 PM. We were seated in about 5 minutes and forgotten about. There was no water. My mom asked for warm water and we were given scalding hot water. When we said this the waiter ignored it. Needless to say, I had to ask for water 5 times..our food was served cold one hour later. It was really cold I dared the manager to touch the food to check the temperature. And when my mom asked for water twice the waiter Ali said yah I'm getting it. Wow, way to go. The manager didn't feel like a manager. So oh well have to find a new favorite. I will miss my moustached tandoori cook though."}
{"text":"I got takeout here and it was absolutely delicious. I had the Chicken Madras and my boyfriend had the lamb Korma and we both really enjoyed our meals. We both thought the spice levels were spot on. Good portion of rice for two to share, many other restaurants you have to order a more expensive serving of rice for each person. Naan was fresh and fluffy. Food was pricey but good portions, lots for dinner and leftovers for tomorrow. We will return, maybe done in next time."}
{"text":"Ambience of India has been my wife and my go to Indian food restaurant in Mississauga since we've been here. Customer service is always excellent, ambiance is great, and they have the best naan bread in town (which is belt fed to your table if you are having the lunch buffet).   Excellent food and now a staple in our restaurant eating repertoire."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food in Mississauga in my opinion, and some of the best Indian I have had anywhere, including India. Their naan are outstanding, pakora is excellent, the spices in all the dishes we have tried are perfectly blended and the portions are generous and ample for leftovers for work the next day. The staff are very friendly especially welcoming to children. The kids really like watching the chefs make the breads through the large glass window they have."}
{"text":"Update: ok. The wait was a glitch that has not been repeated. And I've noticed their dishes are much better. More of what I'm use to from an Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Good service, nice ambiance, excellent food presentation and my Madras Lamb curry was delicious. I'd also recommend the veggie samosas"}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch buffet- It's good, but I prefer the one at Brar Sweets due to better variety. However, you might like it here better if you like your meat, since this restaurant isn't vegetarian.  The ambiance is really nice- you can tell a lot of effort was put into decorating. That makes this a nice place for a more formal meal."}
{"text":"Excellent place for authentic East Indian cuisine. The buffet has a wide variety of tasty dishes to choose from. The decor and pleasant staff make you feel as though you traveled to India for the day."}
{"text":"Don't know why everyone likes this place. I found the price to be alarmingly high.  The waiters were mumbling.  The timing of the food was all wrong. I don't waNt to sound negative but thus place is just not for me. I would prefer more perky waiters. I wish woman were waitress ing instead some  men are not good waiters. I like indian people but I just felt odd being in here."}
{"text":"great service and amazing lamb biryani. meat was soft and spices done just right. a bit pricey but i would still highly recommend it if you want quality."}
{"text":"This is our go to lunch buffet .. Good service, good variety of Indian dishes and salads. And lastly Quality and taste of sweet dishes was ravishing."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised to find the place spacious, posh and classy in its ambience. The waiters were polite and incredibly soft-spoken and conversational.  You get a free basket of Indian crispy bread called \"Papads\" or \"Poppadums\" as starters. In addition we ordered an assortment Kebab platter which was amazing. Soft and tender lamb and chicken kebabs that melted in your mouth. Coupled with the pudina green chutney it was orgasmic.  Then we ordered Lamb Kadhai and Madras Chicken Curry. Each dish comes with a basket of free fresh and fluffy naans. Since we were 4 in total we ordered 2 more garlic naans which were one of the best I've ever eaten.   We also ordered some Mutton Biryani which was rich and the meat was succulent. We also ordered a mango lassi and a salty lassi which were quite simply awesome!  In the end we even got a complimentary round of Gulab Jamuns for us all.    Ambiance of India far surpasses expectations.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"The food is very delicious. It's my new favorite Indian restaurant. The ambience and decoration are beautiful. Service was good. I tried the lunch buffet. The food is fresh and nicely presented. Too bad it's in almost an industrial area!"}
{"text":"Run of the Mill Indian cuisine At $15.99 the lunch Buffet is expensive but has a lot of items, however taste is missing in most. it leaves a lot to be desired. It may be good for most people but simply did not impress me; appetizer samosas were bland and the pakoras dripped oil. Main dishes were 5-6 but not one of them tasted outstanding. Envoirnment is good and very pleasing. Service was good but then again there were only 11 Buffett clients. I would choose from so many other much better Indian restaurants in Mississauga."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant on a recommendation from some friends, but we were not impressed.  The ambiance was not very ambiant.   The restaurant was about 25% full.  The service, IMO, was very poor.   The waiter did not seem to want to be there, and it showed.   I wouldn't say he was rude, but certainly he was not welcoming.  The service was also slow. It took ~20 mins for them to bring the poppadoms, another 10-15 for our starter, and another 10 for the main course.   To be fair the other waiter (the one who we complained to) did seem to take more notice.  Food quality was ok, but not great.    Veg. Pakora: B Korma: C Madras Curry: B+ Naan: B Rice: B  On a positive note, the beer was served relatively quickly :)  We will revert back to our normal go-to Indian (Coriander Green downtown Oakville).  MT"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant quite a few times, and the food is pretty good.  What I don't like about this place are the inconsistent changes to the menu, or so they claim.  The first time I went  they told me free Naan was included with any entree order, but the next time I asked for it, it apparently wasn't included anymore. The third time I went with an Indian friend, and somehow free Naan magically appeared on the table again.  The service is good until they hear that you plan on using a Groupon voucher, then they leave you waiting for the bill for 25 minutes.  I would go back again for the food, despite the mediocre service."}
{"text":"Bit costly compare to many Indian Punjabi restaurants in Brampton & Mississauga. Only plus point is that, this place is not that crowdy and one can have tons of time to munch the yummy food."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful, me and my fiancee hosted her bridal shower here and they were absolutely amazing. They let us decorate as we wished and provided us with delicious and fresh Indian food. My mom does not like tandoori chicken and she loved it here. They are amazing and if I could I would give them a 6th star. Top notch restaurant and even better staff. Make sure you come early for the buffet because it taste best fresh."}
{"text":"Why have I never eaten here before. We came for the Valentines set dinner. It started with an amuse bouche of a semolina crisp filled with chick peas. Then the first course was a lentil coconut soup. It needed salt. But otherwise it was lovely and smooth. The second course was chicken tika fresh from the tandoor located in an open glass both for onlookers. The main was a choice of a number of dishes.  Both the saag paneer and the chicken tika masala were delicious. The rice and peas were wonderfully cooked. The dessert was a choice of gulab jamun and kheer. I had the kheer. The only kheer that rivals my mother in laws. My husband had the gulab jamun. They were lovely warm and juicy in the honey and rose water. All in all a lovely dinner. The place is filled with dark wood and nice staff. I'll be back."}
{"text":"After driving by this restaurant many times I decided to stop in for there lunch buffett..the service staff were very nice with prompt service,  now for the food not a huge selection but the limited choices were well made and tasty both meat and veggie dishes I am personally not a huge fan of Indian food but I would say food was Spicy and tasty my 3 star rating is for the limited selection of food and high price tag . It cost me 21.00 just with a coffee to much for a very limited lunch buffet"}
{"text":"As good as it gets! Really. I like Indian food and I ate at almost 100 Indian restaurants in Canada, the U.S., India, Nepal, Dubai and everywhere in between. Well... almost everywhere. The point is that I believe I can recognize good Indian food, and this place has it.  There are several things I like about this restaurant: - Buffet Variety: They have several cold dishes, several hot dishes, options for vegetarians, nice meats.  - Taste: The food tastes great. They found a good balance between no spice and Indian style spicy. I enjoyed equally the lunch buffet and the a-la-carte dinner. - Service: The service is nice, they offer fresh naan with the buffet, and they have a full bar menu.  It is hard to recommend one dish, I suggest to try them all :)"}
{"text":"Had the worst Indian food at this restaurant. Dont know how it has 4 stars on Yelp! Ordered Chicken lababdar, daal makhani and chicken vindaloo. Every dish lacked salt and spice. Malai chicken tikka was very bland.  Tandoori fish was ok.   Had to ask for salt on the side to make food eatable and suitable for a normal human consumption. Funny how it is over-rated. They had two servers for our group of 15 who were going crazy with the orders and and losing their minds."}
{"text":"Service was five-star atmosphere really old fashioned but the food tasted watered-down old wasn't good at all definitely not worth $14.99 for garbage definitely won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"FOOD: I have had a lot of Indian food before and this was nothing compared to it. There weren't a lot of tasty veggie options and the food was pre-made so it did not look fresh at all. They had good samosas and a salad bar! The naan and the desserts were the good aspects of this place. I expected a lot more.  PLACE: It was very clean, organized, and neat.   STAFF: Kind, friendly.   PRICE: $$$"}
{"text":"Wonderful Indian restaurant!  The ambiance of the restaurant, as it's name would suggest, is warm, inviting, relaxing and authentic. Though casual, definitely not lacking in elegance or quality.   Wonderful service from very polite and knowledgable waitstaff.   Have only been for dinner as I'm not a buffet person, but have only heard good things about their lunch buffet.   Best naan bread I've ever had!  I recommend: Garlic Naan Tomato Shorba (very refreshing and light, super fresh) Onion Bhaji Butter Chicken (nothing particularly special, but a well executed classic nonetheless) Palak Paneer Malai Kofta  Shrimp Vindaloo (amazing but definitely not for those afraid of spice!)  Yummm!"}
{"text":"I live around the area so I consistently order take-out; as such, this rating applies solely to their take-out menu.  Ambiance of India has always provided tasty food, quickly on-demand.  Every time I order, it has been ready within 20 minutes.  Their service is courteous and attentive - they are always eager to chat with the guy who is picking up the take-out food.  Everything I have tried on their menu has been good so far but I am especially a fan of their Mixed Vegetable entree and their Daal Makhani.  The garlic naan bread is a must.  They make it fresh and it never disappoints.  If you have a chance, go to their glass-enclosed kitchen and take a peak at the naan-making process.  It's pretty cool and the chefs are willing to explain it to you.  Tasty food and good service."}
{"text":"Yummy! I was really impressed how tasty all of the dishes were! I'm a HUGE Indian food fan, I go to Indian restaurants pretty often and cook Indian at home, so I'm super picky when it comes to Indian food. That being said, I was a bit skeptical at the beginning (there are often places with weird, sweet or oily dishes) but this place is amazing! The waiter was really nice and friendly, we came late when the lunch hours were almost finished, however, the waiter was really polite, and let us stay without removing the food (lunch buffet hours are until 2:30pm and it costs $12.99). I was happy to see tasty salad options, butter chicken and lots of vegetarian dishes - they were all really delicious (medium spicy) and not oily at all (there are restaurants were the butter is added way too much, not here!). Also, their desserts were really good! They had about six different desserts (that does not include boring ice cream, yeey!). Their mango pudding, gulab jamun and semolina dessert (rava kesari) were all soo good! Nom nom. Will be coming back again! I wish they were located in Toronto."}
{"text":"I quite like this place. I've never done their buffet but I've had 4 dinners here in the last few months. Every time I'm definitely pleased with all the dishes. Great flavours and very fresh. It can be a bit slow but always worth the wait. One day I'll have to try this lunch buffet, but so far for dinner it's fantastic."}
{"text":"Last week I went to this restaurant only to find them making fun of indian food. Trust me I have experienced taste of really good indian food before so I'll know what the real authentic taste is. This restaurant was everything but authentic. If you are in mood of good indian food, I would definitely not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Just had their lunch buffet, it was phenomenal! Definitely the best Indian buffet I have been to in the GTA. I cannot comment on their a la carte.. Yet. But I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great meal! The food was hot , fresh and full of flavor, staff was pleasant, and the price of $12.99 cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"Good desi food. Not cheap. Service has been hit and miss for us. Spices are not too hot which is good because some times the food is so spicy it drown all other flavours."}
{"text":"Bad timing on food delivery.  too expensive. Poor communication skills. Not worth going back.just not really .otivated to go back ever again."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed when I walked through the doors for lunch buffet with some friends today. The effort put into the decor and atmosphere was immediately evident, and the customer service was impeccable.  I wouldn't call myself a connoisseur of Indian cuisine, but I've had my share of the restaurants out there and this was definitely indistinguishable in quality from server-based restaurants, which charge much more. At $10.99 for all you can eat lunch, it's amazing value, and I left stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today for the buffet since its very close to work.  The food was very plain and average.  The service was great.  Desserts were pretty good.    I'm pretty sure I will not be going back. We found a hair in our food and I got sick"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch,the price is pricy and not kid friendly price. Is not to much choose for the food and do not have ice cream."}
{"text":"First time there. Ordered take-out. The staff was extremely courteous while we waited for our food. We ordered the biryani and the Rogan Josh.  I can confidently say that the Rogan Josh was cooked to perfection. The biryani was pretty good too.  Will definitely visit the place again for a dine-in experience."}
