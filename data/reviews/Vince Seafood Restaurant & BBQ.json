{"text":"I've been going back to Vince regularly each week for the past month and I've decided to upgrade it by one star because the service has improved since I last reviewed the restaurant.  I find that going early in the morning when the restaurant opens is the best time to go. It's not so busy at that hour and service tends to be more attentive.  If you go often enough and the waiters recognize you, they will obviously treat you better.  I still think the dim sum here is good.  I recommend the shrimp dumpling in papaya soup and their rice noodle rolls. Sometimes the latter is hit or miss, but generally, I find that Vince makes one of the best rice noodle rolls in town!  The skin is thin and wrapped tightly around the contents, which is how rice noodle rolls are supposed to be made.  So what made me come back to Vince in the first place?  I was looking for a restaurant that's nice and quiet on a weekend morning and this place doesn't really get busy until 10:00 AM, and what brought me back a second and third time is that the service gradually improved with each visit.  Most of all, I can yum cha for hours and they won't rush me."}
{"text":"We had dinner combo the first time been there. Roasted Duck was amazing. Duck skin was really crispy. Lobster with Noddles was quite tasty too. The second time we decided to try the dim sum, which is the lowest price I've seen. But the quality really let me down. The shanghai bun was cold. Veggie tofu roll tasted awful, the mushroom filling had gone bad I think. I would recommend dinner for sure, but certainly not a good dim sum place."}
{"text":"Located just 15 minutes from home.  Went here often before it was Vince's.  The food has definitely gone downhill since the old restaurant closed(name escapes me).  Portions i find are a bit small and dim sum is quite expensive due to their \"special\" selections which cost a lot more. Dim sum quality lacks in taste and i guess the only positive thing i can recall is the service.  Head somewhere else people...better options in the area."}
{"text":"Good dim sum and reasonable prices.  The food came very quickly and tasted good and fresh.  The specials are cheap and the staff are quite friendly.

The washrooms are really gross.....i wouldn't recommend going before eating as you'd probably loose your appetite."}
{"text":"This is my family's to-go place for dim sum (generally on weekends). Their food quality is quite good especially for the price being paid, so the overall customer value is great. The main dim sums are cheaper before 11AM on weekends, but its only $0.20 more expensive after 11AM anyway.

Even if you go on weekends, the line up is quite short. Their service is pretty good too and the servers are friendly. The restaurant itself is bright and somewhat spacious. And most importantly, you can find the common goodies there."}
{"text":"This place is really good! The food is tasty and price is amazing for what you get. The place looks decent too and service is not bad. Came here twice and had lobster both times, both times were delicious. Their other dishes like the fish, beef, chicken etc were all pretty good as well. I'd also really recommend their \"Wintermelon soup\" for $20, but make sure you preorder it! 

Just a warning you should bring someone who knows Chinese though. I think it'll make your time here easier."}
{"text":"I came here a few times while I was visiting Toronto because they have like, everything you'd ever want for dinner. Seriously. When I was a kid, you could only get these dishes for like, a special occassion. But imagine going on a random Thursday and ordering peking duck, and crispy skinned pork and jelly fish, delicious steamed lobster. Just because it's a Thursday.

Soooo in other words, prices here are crazy reasonable enough that you can come here on a random weekday and decide you feel like having all those awesome dishes you could only have once a year when you were a kid for the price of any regular Chinese dinner.

Why only the two-stars then? Service here is definitely hit or miss. One time I went and it was gold. I was ready to throw down 5 stars. The next time I came was for my mom's birthday dinner. That's a big deal. But everything went wrong that night. They messed up dishes, things came cold, some things came tasting off, they sat us in an area that was pretty much a freezer despite the fact the rest of the restaurant was fairly open.

So you'll have to take your chances with this place. if I go back one more time and the place is decent, I'll keep my star rating at 3. Otherwise, I'll send another review to drop it down one. Just a customer beware sorta deal. You've been warned!"}
{"text":"Update: roast pork continues to be incredibly delicious. Deep fried lobster and deep fried crab claw are excellent. So are the noodles that come in your standard ten course dinner. Way to step it up, guys!!!"}
{"text":"This will probably be my last time visiting this place. My family and I came here earlier tonight for a Mother Day's dinner. We ordered a set meal and the dishes came out at a decent time, and the food was good. It wasn't until near the end of dinner when we called for the bill my mom noticed on the slip of paper with our order written that one of the dishes didn't come. So we asked the waitress about it and she apologized and that she'll check. My mom told her no need since we're finished with dinner and would like to cancel that dish, but the waitress told her if the kitchen is making the dish then we can't cancel.

Anyway, by the time the dish arrived our table was already cleared. The waitress sets our table again - yes I know, just to eat one dish? We didn't even want it anymore, the food did not taste good bc it came out cold! After, the waitress came and said she'll bring us the desserts...well that took around 20 minutes! At this point, everyone was pretty much pissed out.

Overall, service was average..several times the servers either forgot to bring us refill of teas or brought us the wrong order and of course they forgot one of our orders. This was actually our second time that this had happened, the first time was on Chinese New Years - but we understood bc it was extremely busy and everyone's running around. But tonight wasn't too busy I thought.."}
{"text":"Well, this is my first time writing for a food court vendor but honestly once I tasted their food , I felt like I was in a restaurant but this kind of food comes from a food court vendor. Vince BBQ & Chinese Food is a food court vendor that is operating in conjunction with their main restaurant , Vince Seafood and BBQ , which is located just steps away from the food court. Vince BBQ & Chinese Food is a great place for customers to have a quick , hot, fresh , and tasty meal that can be eaten at the food court or be available for take-out. Rather than having a sit down meal at the nearby restaurant, customers can expect to have quick and efficient meals in a matter of minutes. Vince does the classic stir fry dishes to perfection. They stick to the classics and customers will be able to enjoy these dishes for a good price. They have great combinations in terms of dinner where you can make a selection of how many dishes you would want. For example, you can select 3 items, which includes rice and soup,  from their special combo menu for $19.50 plus taxes. This is a great deal if you are feeling a bit off take out for an evening dinner. In terms of the fried noodles and rice, the prices are very reasonable , ranging from $5-$7, and you will not be disappointed, they are absolutely amazing.  The BBQ selection is astonishing, I have not had good Chinese BBQ for a long time, and if you want a taste of authentic Chinese BBQ, this is the place to go. If you can't decide what to order, I would recommend trying the Cantonese Chow Mein, Yeung Chow Fried Rice, Stir Fired Beef with Seasonal Vegetables, Salt and Pepper Pork Chop,  or their BBQ items with Noodles in Soup. I will defintely be coming to this food court vendor for a long time. Before I forget, try their Soya Sauce Chicken Leg Special ! $0.99 for a chicken leg, what a deal !"}
{"text":"2.5*.  The food was mediocre.  The service wasn't great.  First, we were put in the small and dark back room (storage room?) when there were empty tables at the back upper section of the main restaurant.  Then they forgot to give us the dim sum menu.  Then we had to ask two times for hot sauce.  The SP dish - curry octopus- was over priced compared to the amount and quality of food received.  Our tea which they charged for was good and the staff was good about ensuring this was filled.  This was our second time there and we will not be returning.  Too many other places to go to in Markham."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Really the food would have had me coming back.

The service was just terrible.  I don't have a high standard for service when I am at HK Style Restaurants because unfortunately, poor service & HK restaurants generally go hand in hand.  I mean the service is efficient, but poor.  Under-staffing and tip management is the main reason to blame, but that's a whole other story, for another time.

The service at this restaurant was depressing.  I got number for a table of 2 for me and my gf.  We're a small table so it was hard to flag anyone down.  The boss is too busy servicing the big table customers, and so are the service captains.

One of the waitresses that finally serviced our table did so very reluctantly.  Gave us almost a \"god, why are you even here, and sitting in my section?\" feeling.

The waitress that ended up servicing our table in the end (due to the fact that we were unable to flag down the same waitress again) was very friendly.

Oh and our tea pot came with a side of grease and sauce.  Yummy.  So we ordered a cup of ice water.  The cup was pretty dirty, so instead of telling them, we just ordered another cup of ice water--still dirty.

Food was great, everything else, not so much.  Won't be coming back until new management/owner."}
{"text":"We normally head here for dim sum early in the morning and there's less crowd.  Dim sum is $2.28 for all sizes before 11am.  Pretty much everything on the menu is quite tasty.  My only complaint is that the seating is very tight.  You can barely walk between tables."}
{"text":"I really want to give Vince more stars, but I can't per the dinner last evening.  

The main reason for the low rating was the inefficiency of the kitchen.  We placed our orders at 6:38pm (the ticket was time stamped).  We ordered a seafood tofu hot pot and a honey and pepper eel dish.  The hot pot arrived in 15 minutes.  The eel arrived at around 7:30pm.  Yap, it was a whole 35 minutes wait for the second dish.  We asked the waitress to follow up on the eel dish twice.  A manager finally lost it and took our ticket to the kitchen to follow up the third time. (At least the service on the restaurant front was good).  I noticed that 2 other tables around us also asked to follow up on their orders.

To be fair, both the hot pot and the eel dish were delicious without being oily at all.  The hot pot was of reasonable portion size, and the eel dish was a bit smaller than average, but this was well compensated by the deliciousness. 

I have always enjoyed the overall dining experience at Vince since it has opened.  I enjoy its dinner more than its dim sum.  I hope the kitchen has had an off night yesterday only.  I will surely return to dine again and update the rating.  I hope the experience will be better."}
{"text":"LOBSTER SPECIAL ALERT !!!
Limited time only
$5.99 lb when ordering over 8 lb lobster
In comparison; other restaurants will charge $15.99 lb for lobster
Make reservations because many people are coming for the special pricing 

We ordered one of the largest lobsters I'd ever seen. A single 12 lb monster of a lobster. The claw itself was larger than 2 hands put together. Even though the lobster was so large and so old it still had the same taste and texture of smaller lobsters. However, if I were able to turn back time I would have order two 6 lb lobsters to get more tail meat.

Deep fried salted eel $22.95 - decent but I would rather have fried eel with a sweet honey sauce or Chinese XO sauce (3 stars).

Sweet and sour pork was nice and crunchy but not overly hard and not overly battered (4 stars).

Beef sirloin was done very well with the caramelized onions but portion was small (4 stars).

Service was a bit slow because of how busy they were."}
{"text":"Came here with unrelated Chinese 'family' for a huge dim sum lunch. We ordered tons and tons of stuff (see picture). 

Everything was quite good, some particular standouts include their fried sesame ball with egg yolk dessert ('Jeen Diu') and their Har Gow/Siu Mai. Would avoid the steamed bun with the glutinous rice filling though. Bland and fills you up unnecessarily - save room for the other good stuff instead! Everything is steamed/fried fresh to order, which is refreshing compared to other places.

For dessert, the sweet deep fried Taro 'fry' is their speciality, apparently from the Chiu Chow part of Guangzhou Province in China. It tastes like a glorified french fry coated in coarse sugar - so amazing for some people and meh for some others. 

Didn't see what the total price came out to, but if you come on weekdays before 4 I believe, it's 2.28 for everything, which is amazing value compared to all the other Dim Sum joints I've been to."}
{"text":"My dad and I came here for dim sum. It's $1.98 before 11:30 am and there's no tea charge. However, there is a tablecloth fee and the price varies depending on the table size. Since there was only the two of us, it was $1 for the small table.

We ordered 5 dishes - sweet corn and pumpkin congee, chicken feet in soy sauce, egg with ginger sauce, Shanghai style bun and sweet egg yolk cake. What I like about this restaurant is the selection of food they offer. Also, everything came really quick and tasted awesome. The sweet corn and pumpkin congee wasn't the best I've ever had but it was still decent. I've had sweet egg yolk cake before at another restaurant and hated it but I thought it tasted really good here.

Lastly, the service here was great. We weren't regular customers here and I felt that the waitresses treated us very well. They were considerate enough to keep our dessert warm by keeping the cover on the bamboo container."}
{"text":"Great prices. S, M, L all 2ish per dish; dim sum all day.  Lots of choices.  Cash only.  Def try the special dishes on the back of the menu as well.  My personal favourites are the XO pan fried turnip patties, and the duck skin fried rice."}
{"text":"Looking for good and cheap dim sum places? this is the spot to go!

$1.98/dish during weekdays and $2.38 on weekends

Unlike every other  $2 dim sum spots, Vince restaurant offers both value AND quality.

Menu is extensive, they have 7 different kinds of fillings in their rice rolls, and 6 different buns. 

Everything came out relatively warm, made fresh. 

I would give it 3.5 stars for food, but because of the value, and comparison to other Chinese $2 Dim sum places, this is where you will get the most bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Vince Seafood Restaurant & BBQ has one of the most value in weekday dim sum offering around on a weekday morning! Before 11 am, it is 10% off $2.28  S/M/L size and free tea.

Not surprisingly that it was packed with seniors that ordering a lot food to take out for lunch and dinner later to enjoy.

Dim Sum menu is quite interesting with a mix of classical and chiu chow style dim sum. And at this price point, my Yelp friend ordered quite a few and more from the menu.
 
Shrimp Dumpling \"Har Gow\" - A-OK
Pork Dumpling with Liver on Top \"Siu Mai\" - Meh, not crazy about overcooked liver
Pork Rib with Black Bean and Olive Sauce - good portion 
Bean Curd Skin Roll with Mix Chinese Vegetable - lacking filling
Dumpling in Lotus Leaf - love this! great contrast of taste and texture! 
Beef Tender in Spicy Sauce - Tender enough but really lacking any spice, more on the sweet side
Crystal Dumplings in Fish Papaya Soup - huge dumplings!!! shrimp has great bite!
Roast Pork Belly Roll - Not fatty enough and a little dry
Rice Roll with Whole Shrimp - shrimp quite mushy and rice roll itself a little too thin

Overall the quality and quantity are great! A little mix up here and there but service is friendly and decent.

My Yelp friend wants to try the Steamed Fish Intestine Egg Custard... I guess have to come back another time for that!"}
{"text":"We came here for a CNY dinner so it was super pricey, and the service wasn't there. The waitress didn't serve the food, which is what typically happens during holiday dinners. She rather stood around. Don't expect service.. They do have some of the best bbq pork I've had in my entire life though. Everything else was decent but nothing special especially considering it was a CNY dinner."}
{"text":"After a quick trip around the Pacific Mall, my family decided to get a quick Chinese dinner meal at Vince's BBQ. It was a Wednesday evening and the place was pretty packed with local Cantonese speaking people. It looks like your typical Chinese seafood place and can be used as a wedding banquet reception hall during the weekends. 

We ordered the $48 family meal which included chicken soup, bean curd and bok choy, red snapper fish, pan fried beef and mushrooms, and a plate of BBQ duck and pork. There are decent portions and we were pretty full by the end of the meal. My favorite dish had to be the beef and mushrooms and the bean curd with bok choy. The red snapper fish was flavorless and there wasn't much BBQ meat to go around for four people. 

As far as the food goes, I would have given this place four stars. However, I had to take away one star due to the service. The hostess was nice but the food came out really slow. There was seriously 15 minutes between each plate. Other tables were also complaining that the service was too slow and that they weren't receiving their food. We didn't know if it  was because there weren't enough people working in the back kitchen or if they didn't have enough food to feed everyone. In any case, we could have saved quite a bit of time if the service had been quicker.

FYI: The waiters speak English but the waitresses don't."}
