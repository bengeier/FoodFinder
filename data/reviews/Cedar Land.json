{"text":"The worst Arabic food Will experience in your life bad business. Greedy people. Don't waste money and time."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! The grocery store has a fantastic selection of imported foods, & spices. The guys that work here are super nice. I love the food too, its not a fancy restaurant but the food is very tasty. Great vegetarian dishes, terrific chicken & rice, coffee is awesome. Many times I order food to go, do some shopping while the food is prepared. This place is a gem, I live over an hour away & its worth the trip."}
{"text":"Seriosuly, one of the best resturants in Charlotte. My husband and I love the food, service, and people that work there. The lamb is amazing. I wouls eat at this place everyday if I could."}
{"text":"If I said I wasn't hesitant at all to eat here at first, I'd be lying through my teeth.  Never mind the fact that my very Southern in laws hardly deviate from bland American diet, the restaurant is actually continuous with a Middle Eastern grocery and butcher shop!
But boy did our worries quickly disappear when we took our first bite of Shwarma.  Incredible chicken and lamb dishes too and a such a polite waiter.
You may do a double-take when you first go in, but you'll forget all about it when you're devouring your meal."}
{"text":"There are two parts to the Cedars experience, the store and the restaurant. The same people run both. The man running the cash register at the store is also going to be serving you at your table in the restaurant. All the people who work at Cedars are very friendly, and kind and helpful. They will go out of they're way to help you find things and help explain what certain things are. The food is overall very good. Some of the meats are a little dry at times, and some of the appetizers come from a can but everything is spiced very well and tastes great. The half chicken, rice and salad is awesome."}
{"text":"So, Cedar Land has become a weekly habit for us. For the vegetarian combo, I get the falafel (richly seasoned and not at all greasy), fatoush (salad with olive oil/vinegar dressing, tomatoes, cukes, peppers, radishes, pickles, and fried pita bits), hommos (creamy and subtly spiced), and tabouleh (which tastes, to me, like Christmas, so probably cinnamon or nutmeg). My friends get meat-based dishes and have raved about the chicken shwarma and the shish tawook. Don't forget to get dessert! The Namura bird's nest, Burma, and ladyfingers are all amazing.

While the location is a little dodgy, the food more than makes up for it, and the owners are incredibly friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great homemade food!   Best kibbeh I've ever had. We stopped for lunch.  Would definitely recommend for travelers.  Not far from the highway."}
{"text":"Great market with wide variety of spices, olives oils, cheeses, olives, and other Meditteranean foods. The prices are excellent. The owner is very friendly and helpful. It is always a pleasure to shop there, chat with him, and get advice about ingredients for recipes I'm making."}
{"text":"Drove here to pick up tahini paste to make my own tahini yogurt sauce for shawarma (shawerma?).  They had it, it seemed a little pricey, so I will have to do some research to compare and may adjust star rating accordingly.  The proprietor was super nice. Seeing as it is attached to a restaurant I shall have to make a point to try their shawarma and what looked like fresh baked baklava in the window, so be on the lookout for updates."}
{"text":"Food that made me feel like I was home. Authentic and flavorful, the spinach pie was different but delicious."}
{"text":"So far, this is the best middle eastern I've tried in Charlotte.  I ordered the veggie plate where I had a choice of 4 different veggie items listed.  I ordered hummus, baba ganouj, grape leaves, and falafel.  They were all delicious.  Be sure to ask for some garlic sauce.  It makes all the difference.

This is also a small grocery store so I purchased some feta cheese.  OMG.  It was so salty and different from what I get at a restaurant.  

Friendly service and friendly place."}
{"text":"This place seems to be a really well kept secret.  I've driven past it a ton of times and never really noticed it.  Well I finally stopped in and I have to say that it is a really nice place, although it's kind of small.  The staff is super friendly and the service is really good for only having two people to run both the grocery store and restaurant.  The food is great and you can't beat the price.  I loved the lamb and rice, it was just so tender and perfect."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Hands down. A buddy of mine took me here and now I'm hooked. The staff is awesome and the food is great. I come here a few times a week. They have an awesome olive bar, spices are cheap and reasonable. They make the desert and there is a ton of food to pick from. You like Mediterranean style food this place is awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. The uncles have worked there for years and I always feel like family when I go. The food is always comforting. I can get many products there that I can't find anywhere else. God bless them always."}
{"text":"The door directly into the dining area is never open so don't break your arm trying to open it like I almost did.  But do walk in through the grocery store and make sure to greet the staff and you can take a seat in one of the red booths and they will wait on you.

The food is good quality.  The presentation is not spectacular, but there are few other places in town where you can get a $3 falafel sandwich that tastes this good.  Other items are also extremely reasonably priced.  Their sandwiches are pita wraps but satisfyingly filling.  Ideal for lunch or a quick meal to go.  Get the hummus or falafel appetizer for something extra to keep you going."}
{"text":"I went in to the place and I rather liked the market. They've got a lot of good stuff including rose jelly that appears not to be a blend of other things like honey or orange blossom. I ordered the lamb sandwich and found that it was not all that great. First, the lamb was cooked well and had some marrow which I appreciated. The lamb though was not really seasoned and tasted like boiled meat. They also tucked dill pickles into the thing which tasted strange to me. A totally unsatisfying meal. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing so I'm giving it two stars rather than one for benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"Bad news, folks. I must have gone on an \"off\" night...all the other reviews are so positive. What the heck?!

First of all, I was very impressed by the store. They carry everything Middle Eastern! I got lost among their products and I wanted to buy and try everything. My husband spent some time in Syria when he was little and when he saw the dried apricot paste, he was flooded with positive memories. Also, if you are looking for injera, they have it!

So now for the bad news...my experience was opposite than the other reviewers. We ordered the veggie plate and tried all 8 different sides. The grape leaves were small, smushy, and stuffed with salt (or that is how it tasted). The spinach pastry was hard and difficult to eat. The hummus, tabouli, and baba ghanoush were fine. I'm not new to Middle Eastern food and I've tried it a lot, so I feel fairly confident in saying that this had to have been the most unsatisfying and disappointing Arabic meal that I have eaten. However, one redeeming aspect was the falafel...it was good. 

The staff were very friendly and the seating area was clean. I would return to go shopping there, but I would not order anything to eat. Go to support the store and to find great Arabic products, but eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"I am so glad I reconnected with this place! I used to go quite frequently with my mom years ago but have not been there in 4 or 5 years and I am now definitely regretting that!

I was craving Middle Eastern and have been passing Cedar Land every day on my way to my new job so I decided to go pick up some food from there for dinner tonight. Firstly, the proprietor is incredibly friendly and outgoing and he makes you feel right at home and welcome as soon as you walk in. You can tell that he genuinely appreciates his customers and is there to serve up a positive experience. 

Since the restaurant and grocery store are connected, you can actually just order takeout right from the grocery counter which makes it really convenient. I ordered the Hummus with beef Shawarma, Baba Ghanoush, stuffed grape leaves, and some assorted desserts to take home and share with my toddler. While my food was prepared I walked around the grocery and couldn't help but pick up some other little snacks to take home. Although their store is very small, they certainly make the most of their space and it is packed with everything from refrigerated cheeses and meats, to spices and grains, to canned goods and desserts. Everything seems really authentic and the prices are very affordable. My food was all ready to go by the time I finished shopping and as the proprietor rung me up he went out of his way to mention how nice and polite I was towards him; as nice as he is, I cannot imagine anyone treating him any other way...

My toddler and I just finished eating our Middle Eastern dinner and everything was delicious and fresh. I love how irregular looking the stuffed grape leaves are because I can just picture someone making them from scratch in the kitchen and they were fresh and delicious. The hummus and shawarma were also very good, but the baba ghanoush was the star, it was the best I have ever had! I have not tried any of the desserts yet because I am just stuffed, but they look delicious.

The total for the 3 dishes I ordered, 4 little desserts and a few grocery items was $30, which I think was very reasonable, especially for the quality of the food. I am so glad I reconnected with this place and will definitely be going back often to try out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"My family and I absolutely love this family style restaurant. I enjoyed The vegetarian combination which I ordered babaganoush, falafal and fatoosh was sooo yummy.  My husband had the mixed grill and enjoyed everything on the plate.  The hummus was amazingly creamy and the pita was fresh and hot.  After eating I was able to walk over to their grocery area and stock up on spices and loose teas and basmatti rice.  They have everything you can think of in the market.  This place is truly a gem I am so glad to have found this on yelp."}
{"text":"Mediterranean grocery store with olive stand, fresh food to-go [NOTE: according to other reviews this might not be the case as of February, I would recommend calling ahead to confirm!] and sweet treats case [baklava included!] I stopped into Cedar Land recently and immediately had a positive feel from the store. You'll find everything from spices to peach nectar to a case full of baklava-esk treats! You can fill up on olives by the pound and choose from a variety of pita breads, honey's, tahini's and imported sweets! The owner was friendly and the store was laid out in a manner that was easily navigated while not being overly large. This seems to be a great option if you're looking for a product that you wouldn't find in an average grocery store."}
{"text":"Very authentic. Everything we ate was prepared well and tasty. It's in a modest spot but don't let that stop you from coming!"}
{"text":"Food was not fresh, bland, and overall unappetizing.  I love this Middle Eastern food, but this was a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Delicious restaurant. We usually get the hummus, falafel and mixed grill plate with grilled chicken and keftas. It's consistently good. Excellent service and the owner is very friendly and welcoming. 

The store is also well stocked with middle eastern specialties - spices, mixes, frozen food section, olive bar and our favorite, fresh pastries. If there is a special ingredient you need for a middle eastern recipe, they are sure to have it. For example, I found the pomegranate molasses I needed for a Kisir recipe. 

It's definitely no-frills, but it doesn't need to be."}
{"text":"I ordered this for the office and wow, it was a hit! This is the first time we ordered food and people went up for 2nds and 3rds, and everyone was asking what the place was called. This is very authentic and very good. We will definitely keep this on the repeat list!"}
{"text":"Returned here recently to find they stopped making the potato harra. Bummer. Everything else is still delicious."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday (2/6/16) to purchase falafel. When I inquired about the restaurant I was informed that they no longer have the restaurant portion of the business. I was wholly disappointed! I purchased frozen falafel! Hopefully they will be good but still not the same. They still have olive bar & fresh breads, and everything else that was at front of store. Good Luck!"}
{"text":"So I go to this place for my hookah flavors . They have stuff what I really wanted . The staff is attentive and quick the only think I see is they are little pricy compare to other mediterranean grocery store ."}
{"text":"Just called the kitchen is closed currently, because of a fire they had. Will reopen they said in a few weeks."}
{"text":"Visited with my friend today for the first time. Everything was great and fresh. We had Beef Shawarma Sandwich, Falafel Sandwhich, Baba Ganouj, Tabouli, Grape Leaves, and Potato Hara. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"I am really shocked by all of the positive reviews on here. I love middle-eastern and Mediterranean food, and have a lifetime of restaurant and authentic home-cooked meals to judge this food by. 

I headed out there because of all the great reviews and I wanted to try a new place.

The service was friendly. The food was really bad. If you have an allergy BEWARE. 

I told them I could not have wheat - they seemed to completely understand and assured me what I ordered was wheat free. 

Then, when I got it home, I realized that the saffron rice had small wheat noodles all throughout it. I have never seen saffron rice made with noodles like this, it's weird. Unfortunately I had already put my falafel and salad on top of it and eaten several bites before I saw the noodles. Hoping it wasn't enough to send me into major pain. Very upsetting. 

As far as the rice and falafel I did eat - the rice was very oily and not fragrant. The falafel were also very oily and very dense - verging on tough. The only flavor they had was that of the oil they were fried in. It tasted like the oil needed to be changed. 

The hummus looked perfect, but was flavorless. Huge letdown. 

Lastly - the lentil soup. This is my go-to at every middle-eastern restaurant I have ever been to. It's my favorite. When I lived behind a middle-eastern restaurant in college, this was my lunch every single day. I cannot believe how bad it was at Cedar Land. I feel terrible writing this, but it was just absolutely awful. The smell of it warned me, but I couldn't believe it when I tasted it. Very, very off-putting. Went right down the sink. Big disappointment all around. We will never be back. 

If you're looking for this type of food done far better check out Kabob Grill. Actually, every place we've been to in Charlotte is lightyears better, so you're pretty safe going anywhere else."}
{"text":"Before I was vegetarian, I visited Cedarland at least once a week for their Shawarma Baladi.  Wow.  That was one great sandwich.  One I definitely recommend to you meat eaters out there!

I'm not a big fan of their falafel or their stuffed grape leaves (I much prefer Middle East Deli which I think changed it's name last year for both of these items).

However, I do prefer Cedarland for their turkish coffee.  I've had it all over Charlotte, and I do believe it's my favorite here.  I always get a whole pot for the best taste.

I also love shopping in the grocery store for various items!  And the olives here are super cheap and delicious!"}
{"text":"Way to expansive for Halel. Beef sold as tender but was the opposite very tough. Service is ok."}
{"text":"Me gusta la comida y la atención que dan y la comida sabrosa. Bueno lo que yo pedí me gustó mucho."}
{"text":"Two weekends in a row and it's been really good. I can't recommend the chicken kabobs or the whole chicken enough. That and the grocery is kind of awesome."}
{"text":"Oh man, four words: homemade stuffed grape leaves. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE canned ones too (there are maybe 5-6 brands here to choose from, if you'd rather) but of all the falafel shops I've frequented, I've never had homemade. Exciting. 

Falafel is tasty, if a bit small (every city has their own style, it's interesting to me that Charlotte's is the roll-up rather than the pita-stuff) so make sure to grab one of their sides: tabouleh, babaganoush, and homemade samosas (!) all make me very happy. A drink, sammich and side will run you about 8 bucks. 

Also of note: huge jars of pickles run about 5 bucks (a steal) and the olive bar is terrific. It's on the floor. Don't be skeered. Another first for me: a rack of pre-made Injera. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Great great great! They have the best food. Falafel is bangin! I love the lamb. I haven't sat down to eat yet but i call ahead for pickup a few times a month. The guy who works there most of the time is really nice and funny. I also bought my hookah from here. I normally pick up my coals and shisha here too."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't written a review for one of my favorite cheap place to eat! I have been coming here for years, honestly don't remember how I stumbled across this \"restaurant\" since it is more a grocery store. The dine in portion is on the side.  My favorite items are kafta sandwich (wrap) and lentil soup. By far my favorite lentil soup in town. $3.99 and $2.50 makes for a semi healthy and cheap meal. Personally I think the beef kabobs for $9 is a little steep because you don't get much food.  
This is a hole in the wall type place, don't expect anything fancy (decor or service). But this is a solid spot to eat."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! My grandmother is from Lebanon and is very picky about her food.... even she loved this place. We have never ordered an item we didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is a must for anyone who loves food from other cultures. After you order your food, you can browse the foreign products lining the shelves. This restaurant doubles as a grocery store, which you can browse while waiting for your food. I recommended this place highly."}
