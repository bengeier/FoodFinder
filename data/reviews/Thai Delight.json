{"text":"This place is so good! The food is delicious, the staff are so friendly, and the restaurant is immaculately clean. We haven't had a single item that we haven't liked. Do yourself a favor and eat here."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Stopped in for take out on our way back to Apache Junction while traveling through Chandler. Well worth the stop."}
{"text":"Great food. Pad Thai was more authentic than most Thai places.  They provide soup and salad for free during lunch... Very cool. 
It's a nicely decorated place and since it's new it's very clean.  
Nice people too"}
{"text":"Great Thai food right in Ahwatukee!  We love this place.  Our favorites include the Appetizer platter, Thai fried rice with Shrimp and any of the curry plates. Service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Clean, quick and a lot of flavor.  The only thing I would do next time is order the Grilled beef salad with less dressing.  The soak it in dressing which makes the lettuce to wilted for me"}
{"text":"First time ordering from Thai Delight.  We love our Thai, and this place knows how to do it right!   The food was on point (we ordered five things so we could try a variety), hot (we had to drive 10 minutes home, then get it all plated, and it was still hot!) and, it was ready a few minutes before Yelp said it would be!  Will be going back for more!"}
{"text":"This downtown restaurant has been consistently good- I have eaten here several times over the last few years. This time I had the tempura shrimp appetizer and the fried calamari. They were both good, but I found the sauce that came with the calamari to be much more interesting and tasty than the sweet sauce served with the shrimp. The green curry with chicken was very good, with just the right heat (ordered a 3). A friend ordered a noodle dish that she was slightly disappointed in. Overall I would recommend to try."}
{"text":"We were there the first time for lunch.  Nice ambience.  Food was excellent.  Coconut milk based soup was awesome.     I am sure to pay them a visit again soon."}
{"text":"Ordered the papaya salad for takeout. I appreciate the complimentary salad or soup from the buffet, most Thai places only offer the free sides with specific lunch orders. The taste was fresh & flavorful but I was disappointed to see that the salad only came with one shrimp. 
As much as it is the little things that make a positive difference (like the soup/salad buffet), only including one single shrimp in the salad made the my meal feel skimpy. At $9, this salad is more than a side....I'd have rather paid $9 for a salad with no shrimp then to expect maybe 2 to 3 shrimp  & to only be given 1. Hopefully this is something the owners will take into consideration. Service was friendly, the place was cute."}
{"text":"We had Pad Thai chicken #63, mango salad #24, yellow curry with pork #51, heat level 2 to 3. Generous food with leftover. Medium hot heat!  Excellent food just like the reviews!  We have been to Thailand a number of times and this absolutely rates authentic. Fresh spices, generous protein, really excellent flavor.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice place.    A little hard to find as it is tucked in a non street facing strip mall.     Very clean and good service.    The owner introduced himself.    I had the yellow curry.  With a medium heat. I will ask for more heat when I come back.     I'm glad to have a new Thai restaurant in the  neighborhood."}
{"text":"Watch out! I ate dinner here last night and have terrible food poisoning today. We ordered take out last night... Pineapple fried rice and an order of pot stickers. We were asked if we'd like to add shrimp and chicken to the fried rice. I wish we had said no, because I suspect the shrimp was the cause. Now my weekend is ruined because I feel terrible and can't get more than 20 feet from the bathroom. I hope no one else has to go through this type of pain because of this place. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant and good services.
Fried tofu, craft fried rice and curry chicken were yummy."}
{"text":"Well first off I ordered from yelp thinking it was delivery and it actually wasn't. I noticed it had been over an hour since I placed the order so I called and the manager told me it was pick up only (my fault). I told him it was my first time ordering through the app and that I didn't want cold food. He just told me it was still warm.... well warm it was but the chicken was soggy. My pad Thai was to come with shrimp and chicken and I got tofu and chicken :(. I also thought it would be a little more authentic and it wasn't. Anyways this is partly my fault but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Encouraged by all the 5 star reviews, we decided to check this place out. There was no wait and the atmosphere is cute, but beyond that, there's not much I can say about it that's positive. Ok, so first we ordered the fresh rolls and it was literally a bunch of store bought salad mix stuffed into rice paper wrappers with some unseasoned tofu. Hardly any mint or noodles to be found either, so yeah. I brought this to our servers attention, and instead of offering to take it off the bill (which would have been the right thing to do) she tried to convince us that it's authentic and every restaurant does it differently.

My dad got their wonton soup, which was way too salty, and ended up having to throw a bunch of the lettuce from the previously mentioned rolls in it just to make it palatable. After a few bites he decided to take the rest home cause he could fix it at least

For his main course he ordered the mango curry with duck. Our server assured him it was mild in term of spiciness because he told her he didn't want anything too spicy. Well, not only was this dish really spicy, but the curry sauce was way too sweet- it seems they used mango syrup rather than fresh mango to make it. I didn't try the duck as I don't eat meat, but he was concerned about it's freshness since the sauce was so sweet and spicy that it was impossible to tell

As for myself, I ordered the pad woon sen with tofu. I love pad woon sen, and have had many in my lifetime. Sadly, this one was terrible. Greasy, overcooked (noodles and vegetables both) and the sauce was terrible. 

I should also mention that at no point during the meal did our server ask us how our food was. 

Both of us hardly ate our entrees, and as much as I hate wasting food, I knew I wouldn't end up eating it if I took it home and my dad wasn't up to making what would be a monumental effort to fix his dish (plus he was uncertain as to whether the duck was fresh)

When we informed our server that we didn't want to pack any of the entrees to go, she didn't say anything. Two nearly untouched entrees and no attempt to find out why.

Honestly we should have been paid to eat this subpar food rather than paying them for it!

I love Thai food and have never been to a bad Thai restaurant in my life, but I guess there's a first time for everything."}
{"text":"This is a new place that recently opened. Staff is attentive during the meal. Food is delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch based on the reviews and wasn't disappointed.  Lunch entrée come with soup and salad bar. The salad bar had fresh strawberries and blueberries,  and the egg drop soup was excellent.  Entrée were well portioned and delicious.  Wait staff was friendly and accommodating. There is plenty of seating and the atmosphere is pleasant. If you like Thai food, give Thai Delight a try."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in Ahwatukee, bar none, and certainly one of the best in the entire valley. 

Great service and great food--what more could you ask for? I wish I could eat here every day.

Their Thai fried rice with chicken is always top notch; it's very fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"We meet our friends for dinner often at Thai Delight & have always been pleased with the food & service. The red curry is a little too spicy for me & it can't be ordered to be made a little milder. One of our favorite places!"}
{"text":"Found this amazingly authentic Thai restaurant while on a business trip!  The food is fresh and flavorful and the portions were huge!  I've been to Thailand many times and this place is the real deal.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Try the peanut curry, and the fresh spring rolls. The owners are super friendly, and the atmosphere was great!!!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. This is my second visit and both times have been excellent. Love their Panang Curry. Try the Thai Tea. After dinner, we were given coconut pineapple ice cream, made by the restaurant, at no charge. A tasty end to a great meal. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Ordered tonight using Uber Eats. Delivery was fast. Food was hot. And best of all, the food was amazing. Ordered five different items and everything was delicious! Can't wait to visit the restaurant and dine in person."}
{"text":"We have never eaten anything but DELICIOUS food here! Tonight, I ordered the Crab Fried Rice. Soooo tasty. Sweet crab meat with cilantro, onion, and egg. Everyone at the table kept taking bites. The Tom Kha soup is the very best I've ever had. You will not be disappointed eating here."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and service. I am not an expert on Thai cuisine, for my first experience the food was so flavorful and spiced just right.  Everything was simply delicious! I can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"Went because of great reviews and we were not disappointed.  4 adults and 2 small kids.  All the adults know good Thai food and even cook some dishes.  Pad Thai was one of the best we have had anywhere.  The mango curry was a big hit too.  We also tried the Mossaman curry and the grilled seafood.  Service was very attentive but it was a quiet Tuesday night.  Overall the food was excellent and, for the price, a good deal.  Even though we were too full for dessert, to our delight a final course of pineapple ice cream was served to everyone and was a big hit with the small kids.  Will de"}
{"text":"My first time trying Thai Delight and I'm a fan!  I arrived around 11:40 today, hoping to beat the lunch crowd.  When I arrived I was the only guest in the restaurant, maybe the first guest of the day because they opened at 11.  I was greeted immediately.  While dining, business picked up a bit, 7 more people came in. There was plenty of available seating.
 
Similar to other Thai restaurants, Thai Delight offers free and unlimited hot soup and salad to accompany your meals.  The salad bar is slightly different.  It's just regular toss salad but they also have tomatoes, cucumbers, green onions, strawberries and grapes.  How nice?!  They did not have the peanut dressing most are used to.  Instead there salad bar comes with some sort of Thai Vinaigrette maybe.  It's delicious.  I had 2 servings.  The soup also taste a lot fresher than other Thai places I've tried.  Some Thai soup taste like it's loaded with soy and sodium to me.  This soup did not!

I ordered the L3 - Pad Thai.  I keep it simple! The portions were HUGE.  I can't imagine what the dinner portions are like (see pics). Again, the food didn't taste like it was loaded with soy and sodium.  No after taste from the eggs and chicken (which is what I've experienced at other places). I opted for level 1 for my spice level - it was perfect.  So was the spring roll that accommodated my meal. 

I was in and out, full and pleased within 40 minutes.  Probably could have been sooner but I sat and enjoyed another helping of salad before I left.  I also used my check it offer and got a free Thai Tea (large).  I've never tried Thai Tea because I didn't' like the idea of milk I my tea but I rarely decline a free check in offer   I noticed on the menu it said if you want more OR less ice in your Thai Tea, it'll be an extra dollar.  Really?! 

All of this goodness cost me less than 9 bucks (without the tip) and I have leftovers for dinner this evening or lunch tomorrow.  I would most certainly go back, next time I'm bringing friends."}
{"text":"Outstanding Thai food, and I've tried places in the area and been pretty disappointed. Don't let the bland facade and location fool you. Did a takeout order and had fresh rolls, tom kha and spicy basil with chicken. Finally great to see multiple meat options on the tom kha and everything was excellent. Big portions, great leftovers. And the staff was awesome. Gave us bottled water and coconut ice cream while we waited. I highly recommend them, drive past the Thai basil and keep going to Thai Delight instead."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!  We went for lunch 3 days during our week in AZ.  Wish we could move this place to VA!! Staff and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Soup and entrees were delicious,and very generous. Pineapple coconut ice cream was really good."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!!! Plus free coconut ice cream for dessert. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and fresh, been a couple of times and both have been great.
The soups are awesome, pad Thai and drunken noodle too.
Love having a local restaurant that does such a great job"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, fresh and a very good deal! One of the better Thai places not only in Ahwatukee but in town."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a healthier choice, so decided on their \"grilled\" seafood. Sorry, but not impressed since it looked and tasted like sautéed and was overly sweet."}
{"text":"I'm writing this as I sit here. I got here at 7:50pm and ordered food at around 8:00pm.  

We ordered two appetizers, one soup, two entrees, and one drink. 

It is now 8:27pm and one appetizer came out. We ate our appetizer pretty fast because we were famished. It is now 8:31pm and nothing else has come. The second appetizer came out at 8:35. We received the rest of our food at 8:43pm. We finished our meal, paid the bill, and left promptly at 9:01pm. 

Generally, I am a very patient person. However, tonight, I was irritated. I do not understand how it took almost half an hour to receive two fried appetizers and a cup of soup. I was also annoyed that they forgot the drink. I also felt bad because the couple next to us was receiving the same level of \"service\" and their child was really hungry. 

I have worked as a waiter in a similar restaurant of size and cuisine with the same number of staff members. Our average time from order to appetizer to entree was 5 minutes and 10 minutes. 

This restaurant somehow managed 27 minutes to appetizer and 16 minutes to entrees. I'm not placing the full blame on the waiter. I'm placing blame on the entire establishment. 

I will give credit that the food was good (note two stars instead of one) but it was accompanied by poor logistics, timing, and service. It was very disappointing and I have to say that I will not return."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. They sure do not skip on  the portion size and had plenty of chicken, basil, and veggies in everything.  Walked out full, happy, with a sizzling experience that came with plenty of leftovers... coconut pineapple ice cream helped cool the mouth. Yummy all the way around."}
{"text":"Lovely clean, spacious and authentic Thai restaurant with friendly staff, generous portions and reasonable prices. Simple, modern decor is pleasant. My green curry dish with avocado was excellent. There was also surprise complimentary coconut pineapple ice cream afterwards. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've made a review for anything on here. I have to say this place took me by absolute surprise of how flavorful the food is and how filling the meal was! Got the Thai Fried rice and the Pad See-Ew and it was DELICIOUS! Took me and my girlfriend by absolute surprise and blew us out of the water! Very good food, very clean place, and very good people! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Ahwatukee! The spice scale is just right and they always have seating available. Prices are normal for Thai, not cheap and not too expensive. The quality of food is great and it's always prepared to order. I haven't had a dish that wasn't delicious! (And I think I've tried it all!)"}
{"text":"We have had several great meals there (and love the complimentary ice cream) and the service is friendly. However, I think there growth has raced passed their capacity...we had a bad service experience where we waited 40 minutes with no update and then found it was another 15 minutes...1 hour is way too long to wait, particularly when no indication was given it would be that long. Should have give us a complimentary appetizer or something. Would suggest getting an estimate for food when arriving (treat it like a to go order).  Hope they fix this - want to see them succeed."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the metro. Best customer service, food quality and quantity, and best price."}
{"text":"I'm not only giving them 5 stars for the excellent food, but 5 stars fir their great service! I placed a Togo order and was greeted with a warm hello. I was given a cold bottle of water while I waited for my food to be bagged up. Nice touch! It's the little things :) 

Food was great! Yellow curry was full of flavor and fresh! Mango sticky rice dessert was perfect! I will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Takeout on a weekday night. Delicious Panng curry that I stretched into four yes FOUR meals by adding extra vegetables. Pad Thai is solid. Delicious chicken larb. So nice to have this in the foothills."}
{"text":"Small place with good atmosphere, food was great! Everything looked fresh. We had the coconut soup, thai fried rice and drunken noodles. Everything was awesome and took some home to enjoy the next day."}
{"text":"My husband took me here the past couple of weeks after he stumbled upon it during their grand opening week.  He kept raving how great it was, and I was at first a bit skeptical because I have my usual favorite Thai spot.  But he was definitely right!
I ordered my usual meal of a vegetable medley with some type of meat covered in garlic sauce.  It's called Mixed Vegetables Delite at this location.  And with me currently being pregnant, I got it at a mild spice level.
It was absolutely delicious!  The dish had just the right amount of sauce to be flavorful, without it being too soup-y.  It came with a side of rice so it was nice to mix it all in get some of the sauce on the rice.  The spice level was just perfect for me!  Although I\"m not sure I would categorize it as mild....although it could just be the pregnancy talking.  It had a small kick to it, which is what I was looking for!  But for those who hate spice and want the lowest spice setting, I think the mild still might be a bit too much.  But like I said, my taste buds have been a bit out of wack lately.
My husband ordered the Pad Thai both times we went, so I can only assume it must be amazing!  I tried a small bit of the tofu and it was great!  A bit crispy on the outside, but had the normal soft texture on the inside.  It was flavored so well that my husband didn't even realize it was tofu LOL.  He thought it might have been some scallop or type of seafood. HAH!  
They also give you a small bowl of coconut ice cream, although I'm not sure if this is the norm, a lunch special, or just a random act of kindness.  But it definitely helped complete our meal and the coconut was not too overpowering, which I loved!
We will definitely be making this our usual spot from now on!"}
{"text":"Great food. Good size portions and service was exceptional. 
I had Tom khan soup
My partner had garli and pepper with beef. Both dishes were more than we could eat."}
{"text":"I've had this place 3 weekends in a roll and it looks like its gonna be on my menu this weekend to come the food portions are good you definitely will have leftovers if your not sharing you're dish. The taste is of the food was great, customer service was good and the place was clean.  Try the coconut pineapple ice cream its light and tasty.
 Two thumbs up definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"This is a sit down, strip mall restaurant. The food was fantastic, great service, and a good value. The fresh coconut milk (served in the coconut) a was fun. I had the Garlic pepper pork and my wife had the Mango curry. Both were equally good. We finished with coconut pineapple ice cream."}
{"text":"Love the food. Love the staff. Probably the maximum variety among all thai places. Mango curry is yummy. Will definitely recommend if you're in for a delicious Thai food"}
{"text":"I rarely give a 5 star rating but this local gem won me over. It's not super fancy but the decor was really nice. Modern for ol' Ahwatukee which is a nice change of pace. The service was authentic and genuine. Not rushed and really attentive. And the food was outstanding. Hubby got the pineapple fried rice and I got the panang chicken curry both medium and was it spicy but not burn your face off. We also ordered the fresh spring rolls which were very good, peanut sauce not the best that I've ever had but good. We ordered mango and sweet rice for dessert which was delicious. They gave us complimentary cup or coconut ice cream with mango which was absolutely amazing. Creamy and refreshing after a spicy meal. Only down side according to my better half is they serve Pepsi product and he's a Dt. Coke guy. He needs more water in his life so he dealt with it. Great place, lots of options and spice levels for every palate.  We'll definitely be going back! So glad to have another Thai house in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"***Good curry, good service, very clean***

Came here for lunch with my son. I had the Green Curry, and he had Spicy Thai Noodles. The Green Curry had great spice and flavor.  The restaurant was extremely clean and new looking. The waiter was attentive. 

Definitely will return and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"This is a great new restaurant. The food and staff have been awesome every time we've visited!"}
{"text":"My personal favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix. The curry is the best I have found and the other dishes (Tom Yum, Tom Kha, Pad Thai, Larb, etc.) I have tried are equally good. The service has always been incredibly good as well. They even give free ice cream as desert for dinner. By far the best Thai restaurant in AZ."}
{"text":"Wonderful !! Stopped by this afternoon for some take out .. I came here because of yelp reviews and my neighbor recommended it !! 
I ordered drunken noodles and pad se ew .. while I waited the hostess brought out a few bottled waters as well as some bowls of ice cream for my kids which was very nice  ( but sadly my kids are lactose intolerant ) .. food was very good and portions were huge !! 
Definitely will be a return customer !!!
Stop by and check them out !!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. Next time I would not order my food so hot, but I FINISHED IT ALL. The service was excellent. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates quality Thai food."}
{"text":"Thai Delight is a good, spacious, clean Thai restaurant in Ahwatukee. The food is freshly made, and great value for the money. They have a large menu, with everything from tofu to duck. They also have a good dessert menu.
The staff are knowledgeable and friendly. I recommend Thai Delight and will definitely return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice decor on the inside with friendly service. I walked in and ordered dinner to go and service was relatively fast. 

Dinner Entree Garlic Pepper with chicken and brown rice: plentiful and very flavorful fresh veggies and tender white meat only. The sauce was good enough to drink! I especially like the care they put in cutting their vegetables...starburst carrot?! Nice! 

It's not the cheapest ($12 for 1 entree) but you get what you pay for here and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great and fast service and at a good price. Definitely coming back. Surprisingly not crowded. No explanation why. For sure top review from me."}
{"text":"I broke the Thai curse today and tried Thai food for the first time and really like Thai Delight. I orderd Thai Pad with chicken heat level 2 and Mango Sticky Rice. Thai noodles are clear and different than Italian styles and rice based.  Thai Delight cooked them and the chicken nicely. Sticky Rice is a sweet rice dumpling in coconut milk with mango bits and is very tasty. Everyone was friendly and food was ready to pick up. Prices vary depending on item. If you want to try Thai , try Thai Delight!"}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal and was hot and ready for pick up when I arrived! Lamb curry was out of this world! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"1st time visit to Thai Delight and it will not be our last. The food was delicious and the portions size was huge. The prices were moderate. Our waitress was courteous. The evening ended with a surprise complimentary coconut/pineapple ice cream dessert."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Lady serving was watching tv and did not check in on us  not even once and we were the only ones there eating! Seriously just two of us on a Tuesday at 4:30pm! Food had no flavor! I Do not understand why they have that many stars! Never returning! The Thai tea taste like water! So dissatisfied and disappointed. I love Thai food and was hoping this would be the place since we moved to chandler!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has so many 5 star reviews. I ordered from here once through UberEats after learning they no longer delivered Thai Chilli 2 Go (my go to Thai place at the time) and found it to be the worst Thai I've ever had in my life. It was spicy, but bland. No real flavor -- just heat. Ordered the Spicy Basil and Panang Curry. Hopefully, it was just an off day. I've never ordered again and am not likely to."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but I was sold after the first. 
The owners really know how to treat their guests. They are always attentive even when they are slammed. I will be coming back again. In fact I just ordered take out!"}
{"text":"New Favorite, Delicious Food! Great Portions!

Friendly husband and wife team make delicious Thai food that makes you want to return every day for lunch!

The Pad Thai dinner was my first awesome meal here! It was absolutely great and a nice portion size fit for a 220 pound man that likes to eat!

Today I got Massaman Curry for the lunch speacial and they even had a soup and salad bar that goes along with it to get you warmed up.

The coconut ice cream is SUPER DELICIOUS!

The Thai Tea is huge and tasty! I have then make it with coconut milk and it's great!

It's a nice, clean, open layout place with nice quiet music playing and clean bathrooms!

I really like this place.... 

Stop by to feed your inner animal and tell them Vladimir sent you!"}
{"text":"Food and service were good. Delicious green curry and coconut pineapple ice cream dessert this visit. Will come again!"}
{"text":"How can I just find this place? It's pretty amazing. 

I had the coconut soup with vegetable, as suggested by my server. It was WONDERFUL! Just right amount of sourness and saltiness in this flavorful coconut soup base. All kinds of vegetables were included. I was surprised! And they have an option for cup sized soup, which a lot of places don't offer but perfect for a side dish for a single person! Awesome!

My entree was the eggplant dish with tofu, mild. Delicious! The flavor was a little bit on the strong side, but balanced perfectly with the relatively bland eggplant and tofu. Their rice was great too! You can tell if an Asian restaurant is good or bad just by tasting their rice, for it's such an important but skillful main dish for all Asian cuisine. They did a great job. I was really satisfied.

And before the check, my server brought me a small cup of coconut ice cream, and told me it was free for all their customers. I was sold! The ice cream was very tasty too, with pineapple and coconut pieces in it! My FAVORITE! Yum! I came here pretty late at night, but they never tried to rush me out the door, and treated me very politely and nicely instead. I'm very glad I came here tonight.

Overall, I had a very pleasant and satisfying dinner experience here. Thank you! I would highly recommend it if you're craving some great Asian food. I'll definitely come back again myself and maybe bring some friends with me as well."}
{"text":"The food is solid, but the service is lacking. Came in with my family, and our order was served to us piecemeal. It took so long that I requested that the last 2 plates, that were yet to come out be served to go. 

Next time, we will just order take out."}
{"text":"This has become our favorite father-daughter date spot. 

I've been here probably 10 times with my dad/other family members and every time my dad has gotten something different and LOVED IT. He's normally not someone to compliment food or be very impressed but this place is so good. 

I get a cup of tom kha soup (it's honestly big) and a side of fried rice (why is their fried rice like crack? I've never felt this way before about fried rice ) and I can't stray away. Yummmm. I hope they stay in business forever.

Best Thai place in Ahwatukee. I've had everything else and nothing compares."}
{"text":"No lie, this place is one of the best Thai food I ever had! Services was very good and food came fast. Im not a local here but when I return to Tempe Im definitely coming here. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I am a Thai snob, but this place didn't set my taste buds aflame.  Perhaps we ordered wrong.  We selected the coconut shrimp and the spicy basil noodles.  While the coconut shrimp were quite good, with a pleasantly crispy and coconutty shell, the noodles were uninspired with a flat \"meh\" taste.  The basil flavor was not popping, and the noodles were slightly overdone.  Till we meet again, Thai Delight."}
{"text":"We're new to the area and Thai Delight has become our go-to place for really good Thai.   Great food, very quick and friendly service, and good prices make this a winner.  
As a meat eater, I hate ordering an Asian dish and end up searching through the veggies for a piece of meat.  That doesn't happen here as there is an abundance of meat in the dishes they serve.  My favorites are the drunken noodle and pas Thai.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food, clean, prompt.  We came for lunch and no one really explained the menu.  Once we ordered, I asked the waiter if the buffet I passed on the way in was where we get our soup and salad.  He said yes but it would be nice if you are new there, to tell you. I ordered the green curry chicken and it was delicious with all the veggies.  Also no high chairs or booster seats.  Ahwatukee is a family area and they need to invest in those.  It was hard to dine with my one year old.  On the way out, the owner was standing right at the register and never said bye or thank you for coming in.  They need to step it up on the customer service side and actually talk to their customers.  Otherwise, very nice experience and I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is great! I was really impressed with the presentation of the food too. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I each have a dish to test a new Thai place.  Her's is Mee Krob and mine is Pad Prik King.  Both at Thai Delight exceeded any we've had. I am based in L.A. but have had Thai food all over the country and this is as good as it gets.  She is from Chicago and has traveled a lot too.  We were both impressed.  They also make one of my favorites that not every Thai place makes, Pumpkin Curry.  It was very delicious as well. They will make things as spicy or not spicy as you specify which is useful for all different palettes. I really can't say enough about a simple place that just has the best darn flavor around.  That's what it's all about."}
{"text":"First time here and not my last! Server was super friendly and the food is amazing! Big portions and really tasty food. Just move to arizona so im happy to find a new thai food place!"}
{"text":"My family's favorite Thai place!!! Always good and the staff is friendly and attentive. Feels like we are part of their family when we eat here. Tried many things on their menu, cannot go wrong with anything."}
{"text":"Great food and great service my new favorite Thai restaurant. The soup was the best and really fresh."}
{"text":"So good!! The restaurant is lovely inside and our service was great. Yellow curry simply delicious, nice touch with the scoop of ice cream after! Will be back."}
{"text":"I just so happened to be in the area with a co-worker and we were craving some thai food. When we walked in, I was very impressed with the decor. Very cute and modern! I ordered the coconut soup, pad thai with chicken, she order the drunken noodles, and the same soup. We both were in thai heaven! It was actually her first time trying thai food and she couldn't believe what her taste buds were missing. We both live in Gilbert and kept saying how we wished they were closer however I know I will be coming back here :) I will be taking my husband with me next. Service was great and food was wonderful."}
{"text":"Food was great and quick!!! I ordered the spicy basil lunch special. The only hesitation I would have would be the ground chicken. A little odd to me but tasted good."}
{"text":"The food is good, service was pleasant but while I was sitting trying to eat the guy from the kitchen kept coming out and looking over the wall at me..his head just darting over here and therex to the point where I was kinda uncomfortable.. Now I can see if the place was packed and they were looking for empty tables but it was completely empty, and I wanted to sit down relax and take my time eating my food... I don't know I just felt rushed.. 
Other then that the food came out fast and it included a salad bar for lunch."}
{"text":"Great Thai!! Best in years!! Try the pineapple rice, as well as the yellow curry... great service as well!"}
{"text":"I think quality over quantity describes my feeling with this place. Their entrees are giant but lacking the finesse I anticipated. We ordered Pad Thai, Cashew Chicken, and Coconut soup. Cashew chicken shouldn't be fried.... and baked tofu in soup, tofu in pad Thai was the same. We paid a bit  to throw out most of the food simply because it doesn't taste good. But 4 stars for effort, we support small business for customer service and higher quality standards and attention to detail. Hope they can take my comments into consideration!"}
{"text":"Has to be one of the cleanest Thai food places ever!  The food is awesome every time we visit. The staff is very attentive and courteous. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Found Thai Delight via Yelp reviews. Thanks reviewers!  You were right  We had egg rolls - they were crispy & delicious, fresh tasting. Basil rice - lots of good veggies & flavor. Yellow curry with tofu - big chunks of potatoes and tofu, and the flavor was excellent. I ordered spice level 2 (medium) and it was perfect. Consistent flow of to go orders while we were there. We were the only customers at 5:30, by the time we left there were at least half the tables filled. Would definitely eat here any time I'm in Chandler or Phoenix."}
{"text":"First, It was a bit tricky to find. I'ts tucked away in the back. I got there around 6:30 on a Tuesday night, and there were a few customers inside, but things soon picked up, and they have a LOT of people coming in to pick up takeout!

Quick, friendly service with complimentary and tasty soup. I ordered chicken satay and beef Thai fried rice. It was all very good! I took about half of my fried rice home to enjoy later. 

Very close to my house, reasonably priced and the restaurant was very clean, too. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall. Went in for dinner and dining room was empty. Lots of in and out traffic picking up to go orders. Went with the servers recommendation of pork delight at a Thai hot heat rating. Food was good and he heat temperature was just how I liked it. Server was great and attentive. After my meal he brought me a small bowl of ice cream, which was a nice surprise. Dinner was right around $10 for the entree."}
{"text":"Thai Delight
4645 E Chandler Blvd
Ste 106
Phoenix, AZ 85048

A large group of us descended on this restaurant for dinner. We all wanted to try different dishes and compare them to previous experiences.

Companion ordered Egg Rolls and received 5 of them that were crispy and filled with veggies.
Personally, I wanted to have the Mee Krob which had large pork slices and was very good. 

Dishes that were ordered included Duck Curry (nicely cooked and flavored) and Tom Ka Pork soup, which was quite tasty.
One of our party ordered the #18 Platter, which was huge and had shrimp satay and wontons which were made of rolled rice paper.
Another ordered #2 which were soft rice paper rolls with shrimp, noodles and peanut sauce
Also ordered was Pad Thai which was declared to be very good.

For main courses, Drunken Noodles were ordered and were excellent but considered a bit too spicy.

Sweet and Sour Pork came in manageable pieces and was also very tasty.

The Red Curry Chicken was excellent and had nicely balanced flavors.

Another of the group ordered Pad Prik King which was very good and had a wonderful sauce. 

The Panang Curry was very good, but not spicy enough for one member of our party.

Other items ordered were the Chicken Satay and the Thai Delight. 

It was generally agreed that service was excellent. The restaurant was nice and clean and restrooms were properly equipped and clean.

4 stars for excellent service, excellent food, and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Thai delight can not be faulted. The staff are very friendly and attentive. The food is fresh and so delicious. The atmosphere is clean and fresh. We are in the process of moving to Chandler and I can see this as being a family favourite local restaurant. Thank you."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in Ahwatukee if not Phoenix 
We really enjoyed our dinner and the service was great 
We had the chicken noodle and the level of spice was 2 
3 would have been to much spice.  It was perfect"}
{"text":"First time visiting and everything was excellent!  I'm happy to have found this location.  I've tried many Thai restaurants and this is definitely one of the better ones. 

To start, the service was on point!  Continual water fills( so important when you're eating spicy food), and nice friendly service from who I think was one of the owners(white guy with glasses). 

I got the Pad See-ew and it was very good.  My two major complaints when I order this plate is too much sauce and not enough noodle.  I had neither of these problems!! 

One more note, the spice level is true to description.  Which is great. Nothing more annoying then getting your Thai order milder then you wanted and than was advertised. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Vary clean and great food. If you are looking for good Thai food then come here. Everyone here are vary nice and professional."}
{"text":"Food and service always exceptional.  Favorites are the chicken noodles, tom ka soup, and any of the curries.  The ice cream is a nice treat. Our go to place for Thai food."}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai food.  Excellent service.  I will now have to try all the different dishes in the menu.  The Crying Tiger dish was excellent.  So far I tried the usual Pad Thai, Panang Curry and Thai Fried Rice - all excellent. Coming back again."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 3.5 stars. 3 seems like too few, but 4 almost seems like too many. The highlights were great, the lows were more annoying than anything else.

This place opened in our neighborhood a few months ago so my family and I decided to walk over and give it a try. It was delicious! My picky daughter and not-so-picky husband loved the coconut shrimp and chicken chow mein. My son ate up the edamame (it was oversalted but since you don't eat the husk it's no big deal). The fresh rolls were a disappointment. They were filled with the same salad mix that came with the coconut shrimp and the tofu filling was bland. The accompanying peanut sauce was thin, not creamy and rich. My husband had the beef salad with a side of rice and he loved it. The beef was cooked well and the plate was full of flavor. I had the avocado curry with tofu and it was incredible. I ordered it \"thai hot\" and it definitely had some heat. I was happy to have the complimentary coconut ice cream at the end of the meal. 

The service needs some improvement. Our appetizers came quickly but the entrees took longer than expected, we even watched other diners, who arrived after us, receive their meals before us which is frustrating. The bathroom has a weird safety lock so you can't ever tell if it is locked--I thought it was broken and inconspicuously mentioned it to the host who gave me a drawn out explanation about the fancy lock. I know how to lock a door, I just didn't want anyone seeing my goodies over their pad thai.

It would be nice if they had smaller cups for children. The only cups with lids they had were styrofoam (cringe, the environment!) and enormous. 

We will definitely go back, I look forward to this being our new neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Came on a Wednesday night and there was no one we got our pick of any table.  About 20 mins later there was one other table occupied.  The food was good typical Thai food.  The décor was modern and clean - not the typical Houston Chinatown hole in the wall.  It was a quiet night since at the end of our meal the chef and owner came out to the front of the house.

I chose a safe beef broccoli.  The meat quality was good and tasty.  The sauce was a little sweet for my liking.  Also my friend wasn't expecting her fish to be fried and the sauce was definitely sweet - it looked like sweet and sour.

Yelp check in a glass of thai tea made my friend's day after a long project workday.  I personally am meh about thai tea.

The complimentary coconut pineapple ice cream was a nice treat.  The bowl was iced to - it kept the ice cream really cold.  It is like an iced beer mug - it just makes the ice cream or beer tastier.

It was a good casual Thai meal while traveling for work."}
{"text":"Visited twice during my trip and it was so goood. The veggies were super fresh, yummy food and great service. They have great lunch specials before 3:00pm but I never made it for that. I recommend the Chicken Vegetable and the Garlic Mushroom & Beef plates. And don't forget to check in for a free Thai Tea...perfect."}
{"text":"I'm perplexed by the rave reviews because this was one of the most dry and bland Thai meals I've ever had. I ordered the Drunken Noodles with shrimp and there was no hint of sauce whatsoever. It's like they forgot something. It was difficult to eat being that dry so I had to add my own sauce -- whatever was in my fridge and I did not have anything Thai or appropriate for this entree but it was better than nothing. Very disappointed in the drunken noodle dish. If I didn't order it to go, I would have returned it.

I also had a the glass noodle soup with vegetables and tofu. They did not provide enough broth so it wasn't really soup. The broth was flavorless and again, just seemed to be missing something. It tasted like plain water with no seasoning whatsoever, vegetables and clear noodles. Overall I was let down by the food. What kind of Thai restaurant has zero flavor in their food? I won't order from them in the future nor recommend this restaurant. 

The good things: my order was ready when it was supposed to be, the meal came with a bottle of water which was a nice surprise hence the extra star, and the man who worked the register was nice. The restaurant seemed busy with a lot of pick up orders."}
{"text":"This place is actually dangerous!  I have one other that is my favorite but it is far enough away that I only make it in once a month.  Being as close to my house as this is, as delicious as it is, pricing great especially for the portions, and superb service....I go 2-3 times a week at least!  
Turned down the coconut pineapple ice cream the first few times due to being so full, but this latest time I tried it and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Wow all of the food we ordered was outstanding!!!! I ordered the avocado curry with chicken man that was excellent! I have been to Thailand so my reference is good. This place as far as I am concerned the best Thai food in AZ that I have found! The chicken satay is on spot! Most places don't take care on how they prepare this appetizer but they do. Even the cucumber-salad is really  good that comes with it. The peanut sauce was great as well. The staff is excellent and the owners came out to see how everything was. That means a lot to me and shows they really care about their guests! My wife loved her Pad See Yu and I tried it and it was excellent. Not dry like other places. 

If you like Thai food try this place you won't be disappointed and you probably will fine it might be your favorite as well!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had an entertainment card discount so decided to try this restaurant for lunch.  This restaurant is terrific!  The decor is beautiful and our waiter was excellent!  The food was outstanding and reasonably priced.  Vegetables were cooked perfect - tender crisp.  Portion sizes are huge so I got to have a delicious lunch the next day.  We will return."}
{"text":"My son and I ate here for lunch recently. The service was good, very friendly, got our food quickly. We ordered pork fried rice and  chow mein. Both came with a small crispy egg roll, soup and salad. You can order your food spicy, with hotness on a scale of 0 to 5. All of the food was very good. My only complaint was about the salad. I'm not a big fan of iceberg lettuce, which is what was served. I will definitely come back and for sure try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Several Thai restaurants have opened in the Ahwatukee area over the last couple years and this one is by far the best!  Food is always fresh, hot and delicious. Service is great and the portion sizes are huge!  I've had takeout from here a half a dozen times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been back many times, mostly when I get off work and feel like some Pad Thai (Thai comfort food for me) for takeout. With take out they give you a bottle of water which I feel is a nice touch for over the top customer service. Something almost all restaurants charge extra for.

Went back last week for lunch with a friend. This is the first time I've had lunch at Thai Delight. My friend had the Massaman Curry with chicken and I had Garlic and Pepper with chicken sliced (lunch menu shows ground chicken). My friend seems to enjoy her food by not saying much but her plate will be clean when finished. Lol  So I'm assuming she liked it. I loved my dish so much that I will order it again. It had lots of veggies, which I'm always looking for. A lot of places will only put the standard fare of carrots, peppers and onions. Whatever they put in the broth is divine! I think it's a hint of ginger. The pepper in the name comes from black pepper (I think). Even tho it's a lunch portion I took about half home (I'm not a light eater).

With lunch they had a soup and salad bar. The salad choices are limited so don't come expecting to fill up on it. Not sure if the soup changes, that day it was egg drop soup. I added greens onions to it from the salad bar. A spring roll accompanied our entree as well.

My total bill with a Thai Iced Tea was under $13. Stupid me, I checked in and forgot to redeem my free tea! Still good value for your buck."}
{"text":"We tried Thai Delight for the first time and it was great! Had the green curry -hot, tom yum- hot, spicy noodle w/ basil - Thai hot, and the crispy egg rolls. Everything was amazing! Now, I LOVE spicy food and tend to drench my food in hot sauce. The Thai hot is a little hotter than I thought it'd be and I will probably stick with just hot for my spice level next order. In all though, everything was amazing and I'm exited to try more of their food soon!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good value. We had the drunken noodles, pineapple curry, and thai fried rice. Nice size portions, plenty for tomorrow's lunch. :) Close to our house. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I think Thai Delight deserves a second chance, but next time I'll dine in. I ordered a to-go box of vegetarian chow-mein noodles and was excited for my Thai splurge. I was in luck, my order was finished super quickly.  Inside I discovered that they also had Thai tea (a soft spot of mine!) and rushed off with my take-out to cram a quick dinner before other plans for the night. I was super hungry, and disappointed to say the least, as I carefully opened my styrofoam container, tied neatly in a plastic bag to find that napkins and eating utensils are not, apparently, included in the order. I was nowhere near silverware. 

Aside from not being able to eat my dinner ... the place was cute, but completely empty at around 4pm on a Saturday. I saw one other person snag a takeout bag just before I walked in, and wondered why it was so empty. I assumed it must be because the little restaurant is tucked into a shopping mall area next in an area with lots of empty office space. When  I was finally able to eat, the noodles were decent but had lost much of their appeal after my quest to find a way to eat them.... trying first to use two plastic straws I happened to have in my car... and failing miserably. #fail."}
{"text":"The food was delish and the restaurant was very clean! You can tell the owner takes great pride and passion into serving healthy and authentic Thai food.  Can't wait to come back the next time we are in town!!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. I believe it is family owned because it is the same people every time I go but they are so sweet. The free ice cream they give you is to die for"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????
????????????????????????????
?????????????????????????????????????
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"The reason for the 3 stars is not the food.  Food is excellent.  The service is poor.  Not friendly at all.  Too bad too, really good food and they could pack the place.  When we were there, one other table was occupied."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food! Great and ultra friendly service. Huge menu. They listen when you want it hot (so many other places don't listen when you ask for hot - as if you can't handle it).

Don't miss the green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"Everything was super delish and service was great! This is quite a way from home but will definitely be coming back again, soo worth the drive!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai in Phoenix. They use the freshest ingredients and every dish is cooked just right."}
{"text":"Finally, a Thai restaurant near my house!! TL checked out this restaurant on a business meeting/lunch. Monday to Friday they have complimentary soup and salad bar when you purchase a lunch item. The soup is yummy! Vegetables and tofu soup.

I've tried the drunken noodle chicken and pad Thai chicken here. The portions for lunch are dinner are very large! I can't even finish the lunch portion by myself!

The food is very authentic and the owners are polite. It's a husband and wife business.

The Thai tea is sweet and creamy! It comes in a large cup!

Prices for entrees range from $7.95 to $9.95, that's pretty good. 

Stop in for some delicious food!"}
{"text":"This place is mediocre, nothing really special.
We came to this place on a Saturday around 6pm. The wait was ridiculously long. The moment we sat down it took around 5minutes for a waitress to come take our drink requests. We ordered the Tai Tea, it took another 15-20 min to receive our drinks. We decided to put on a timer the moment we got our teas and it took another 45minutes to receive our food. So prepare to have a LONG wait time when you come here.

The food was ok - Nothing special. the coconut shrimp has sweet coconut shavings that made it a little too sweet for my liking.The Chicken Pad Tai was good. and the drunken noodles were ok. The dishes were skimpy on meat so we got more noodles than meat. The spice is mild- so if you like spicy food make sure you order up a heat level.

The service was great and apologetic about the long wait time but it was still longer than what I was hoping for. I'd come here again someday but I wont be rushing to come here."}
{"text":"Great new addition of Thai food around the area. I had a lunch order to go, called in and food was ready in 15 min. Staff was friendly and welcoming. The food had a good kick to it and flavor. I wish the lunch menu had a few more curry options. Other than that it was a nice and tasty experience."}
{"text":"All but invisible from the street. A hidden treasure, for sure!

One of the only Thai places I've been to where I'd say their \"Thai spice scale\" was on point. I always err on the cautious side when I'm not familiar with a place because I know things can be made hotter if I want but not the other way around.

Spice level 2 had good flavor but no heat. Spice level 3 had a reasonable hint of warmth but still no heat. Excellent flavors!

Shrimp Pad Thai and a chicken dish whose name I don't recall. Very happy with both.

When we arrived the only other diners in the place were a group of Asians. I suppose that is not PC to say. But, it also speaks to the authenticity of this place.

Very happy. It'll be high on my list when I'm in that area again wanting dinner.

The place was clean. The people were friendly. The serving sizes were not huge. The pricing was very fair."}
{"text":"Yuuuum! First time here and it was awesome! Very clean and nicely decorated. Great customer service and a great early dinner! I had the Mango delight"}
{"text":"Their food is just top notch super awesome! Very nice people and the place is always clean!"}
{"text":"This little hidden gem is truly a \"delight\"! Had the fried crab puffs which were amazing and the pad Thai, which was a generous helping.

Little surprises around every corner like their license to allow you to bring in your own alcohol and the little scoop of coconut pineapple ice cream at the end of the meal. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in Ahwatukee. The Thai iced tea was large and fresh. I ordered a fresh coconut just for fun!  We split the potstickers with ground chicken. These are fried with very thin crispy shell. Very good.  Mom decided to try drunken noodles with pork and basil. We split it and have enough for tomorrow too! It was really tasty snd ordering it medium was the perfect \"hot\" for us. The ice cream was delicious too. Pineapple/coconut. 
Easy access for handicapped and easy parking. 
We will be back soon. Eat Local!!"}
{"text":"The husband and I tried this restaurant a couple months back and had a mixed experience. We went on a Saturday night and the place was fairly empty. We ordered the mango curry and the drunken noodles. We also receive a free Thai tea with check in (which was awesome!). The noodles were fantastic.... super spicy and delicious. I'd 100% recommend them. The curry was just ok. Not as thick as I would hope and also lacking in spice and flavor. The real issue was when the bill came. The waiter brought the bill and the mango curry was priced 3$ more than it had been priced on the menu. I asked the waiter about it, and he said that's how it rang up, but that he would get the manager (or owner? not sure). Another man came over, I showed him the menu where it said the curry was 9.99 (or something like that) and he told me that that curry was actually more expensive due to the mango, and they just hadn't updated the menu yet. He then said, I guess I can figure a way to discount it 'if you want.' Uh..... ya, I want. You can't just tell a customer the food they ordered off the menu was actually more expensive after they have already completed the meal..... that isn't how this works. What should have been an easy apologize and fix the bill ended up being an awkward moment that left me questioning the level of honesty of the management of the restaurant. Though I would recommend the food here (and may return for the yummy noodles), I would advise that you check your bill carefully."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Thai food in the Valley!! I got the Drunkin Noodles w/ Chicken and the Panang Curry w/ Chicken. Both were extremely flavorful with the PERFECT amount of heat!! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best Thai restaurants I have been to. A lot of the places around the valley seems to have dishes that use the same base for curries, which results in a dish that doesn't have too much of a flavor profile. My mom and I went here for lunch and ordered our regular dishes, chicken pad thai and red curry. I was expecting the standard flavor that these dishes have that I've experienced with other Thai restaurants, but to my surprise these dishes had a lot more flavor compared to other places. The vegetables were also very fresh and not overcooked. I think it's best to go during lunch because of the value and the great amount of food that comes along with it."}
{"text":"Good flavor and big portions. Had chicken satay, drunken noodle with pork, and my mom got the basil fried rice with shrimp. The chicken was cooked nicely, but the peanut sauce was a bit too sweet. Huge portions so can't complain too much.
The entrees however lacked pizazz, there was was no color on anything, like everything was cooked on low heat in a sauté pan as opposed to a hot wok. My noodles were all broken in pieces before I dug in. Disappointing because the flavor was nice. +1 for complimentary ice cream"}
{"text":"I got a takeout order of satay chicken and the minced pork salad (laarb). As I've already noted, their satay is wonderful: 6 generous skewers of perfectly seasoned, grilled chicken. But I love Thai pork salad, so I gave them a chance to impressed me. And boy, did they! The take-out serving was huge, fresh, , herbal, salty, crunchy, tangy and spicy (I asked for level 2 and my mouth is still tingling). The only thing that threw me a little is the addition of short pieces of very chewy, thick noodles (think udon). I wasn't wild about that texture being added to the mix, but it certainly didn't affect the tastiness of the dish.

So now I can add one more dish to my list of sure bets at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place. Fantastic fresh yummy food every time.frequent this place several times a month. Addicting."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in Ahwatukee. Love everything I have ordered. The beef pad see ew and yellow curry with vegetables are my favorite. The décor is great as well and the owners are very nice. Will be ordering dinner there tonight. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today during lunch and.. WOW! Great value, huge portions, and extremely delicious foods. In particular, I couldn't get enough of the zesty all you can eat soup and salad bar. I've found my new go-to Thai joint!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had to curry here and it is awesome. We had the crispy eggroll for an appetizer was really good. Really good food great pricing nicely decorated clean establishment must try. Great Tia in the Ahwatukee area."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent fast service, large portion sizes at good prices. I'm partial to the Pad Thai and fried rice but its all delicious."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch yesterday. I ordered the lunch curry chicken with jasmine rice. The curry sauce had to most delicious sweet flavor. I am already wanting to go back today. The lunch special also comes with salad and egg drop soup. The atmosphere is pleasant inside. The waitress was attentive and friendly. My friend ordered the mango salad with shrimp. She said it is her favorite."}
{"text":"I have been to Thai Delight several times now.  I am hooked!

I like spicy food.  Okay, I love spicy food.  I have been ordering everything at a level FIVE, which is their spiciest level.  One day it was phenomenal and I could not stop eating it.  The next two times, it was actually a bit hotter than expected.  Still, I am addicted to the heat!

I keep going back for more because it is amazing.  So far, I have had the Pad Thai, the Drunken Noodles and the Garlic Noodles.  I like the Drunken Noodles the best, so I have ordered those on repeat visits.

If you go during lunch time, you get salad bar included.  I think they also have soup, but I have never tried it.  My daughter likes the grapes they have in the salad bar.

Thai Delight is reasonably priced.  Most of what I get is $7.95 during lunch and $9.95 at dinner.  Considering I get two meals out of it most of the time, it is a definite bargain!

The restaurant has only been open for a few months, but already seems to have a loyal following.  That said, they were empty on Friday night.  I felt really bad that we were one of only two or three tables in there.  

They even brought us coconut pineapple ice cream for dessert, which happens to be my absolute favorite ice cream from childhood!  They have earned my business for sure!

I urge you to go to Thai Delight when you are in Ahwatukee for some awesome food.  It is way better than the Ahwatukee Thai Basil and service is way friendlier, too!"}
