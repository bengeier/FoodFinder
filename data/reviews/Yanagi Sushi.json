{"text":"Went to this highly recommended place on Yelp for 2 reasons: it's close to home and we have been looking for great sushi! Sorry to say but we were somewhat disappointed. The food was fine but not great. Maybe it was the service that affected out opinion. Took our server about 10 minutes to take our drink order and she was not very attentive after. It was a Wednesday night and not busy. Maybe it was a bad day or night so I didn't want to just write this place off so I took a menu and recommended my fellow workers to go. Well they did and they had worse service than we did! They also said the food wasn't that great and wasn't even able to finish some food because of not receiving condiments that they asked and waited for!! I hope yanagi gets it together like the other Yelp surveys state. Sadly disappointed!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was so good and fresh. First time dining in as a family and the customer service was phenomenal. Our 2yo was mad the minute we walked in and our server calmed him down with some snacks. Towards the end of our meal, he started acting up again and she offered a sweet snack as dessert to settle him down again. We felt welcomed and very well taken care of. Highly recommend and prices are great."}
{"text":"I love this place - I am also looking for good fresh sushi and they have it here. 
You are welcomed from the moment you enter the place."}
{"text":"Understaffed and slow. Ordered twice from this place, first time they added an extra order to my bill which I didn't see until after.

This used to be the Signature Kitchen, which was pretty good as far as Japanese places go. Not sure what happened."}
{"text":"Another very mediocre sushi place..  fish wasn't fresh night I had it probably 3 days old or so, and was of poor quality. If you like rolls the California roll that came with it was edible but my review is on the sushi and sashimi. It seems as though people leaving reviews that this is great sushi are Eating it for the first time or perhaps haven't tried good quality authentic sushi"}
{"text":"This place has much higher quality fish than its competition on the Danforth. It also serves raw oysters, sometimes! And somehow their avocado is always ripe and soft but never spotty. My only wish is that they had a real website with a complete menu available; having JPEGs of the menu on FB doesn't work very well. Similarly, we ordered takeout and received no menu with the order, which makes future ordering a tad more difficult. But everything we've eaten there has been quality, and I can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere is so chilled. I love the music they play. The server is fast, super friendly and such a sweetheart. The food is great too. I love it."}
{"text":"Really good sushi place, everything is always nice, fresh and made with high quality ingredients. 

Have never ate in the restaurant, always get take out but the place is very nicely set up inside with a decent amount of tables and very clean.

Would have received 5 stars if they were more punctual on pick up times. Even if we are told it'll be ready in 30 mins from when you call it's always 45 mins to an hour."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Az. Sashimi sampler has my 3 favorites! Definitely my go to spot. The staff & owner will make you feel right at home. The love rolls are amazing. Everything I've tried has been amazing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We came and had dinner at this place last week and Jennifer the host/owner and the staff was very nice, friendly and accomodating. We started with an appetizers, soft shells crabs was so good, variety of sushi that we had was so amazing, salad and miso soup was delicious, I ordered the galbi and wow that just hit the spot. I highly recommend this place and we are definitely coming back. All I can say is thank you and I love this place!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by for lunch and had the worst experience thanks to the Sushi Chef who was rude from the very minute we walked through the door. It was evident that he did not want to be there and did not want any customers, either. From behind the bar he barked (yes, actually yelled) at us to wait to be seated even though we were just heading to sit at the bar. As my sister and my niece discussed possible options he eavesdropped on our conversation, interjecting his negativity and discouragement at ever turn: \"that roll will take 20 minutes MINIMUM\" and \"you can't order off the lunch menu today\". We actually got up and left before ordering, and as we were leaving another patron, who was also leaving, stopped and asked if the man was also rude to us; she told us he was also mean to her and her son, her son was going to confront him but she was afraid he might take it out on the kind server working there. They also left because of his behavior. We will not return and unless you want a pile of negative energy rolled up in your dinner, you might want to pass on this place too."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the owner is so nice, he has an amazing personality and is very helpful in helping find the right dish for you. This is going to be one of my go to sushi places for sure."}
{"text":"I would like give a zero star if I could. Our family went there as my kid's day care place is around and I believe in the good reviews. The waitress greeted with us with cold face when my son said hallo warmly to her. This made me mad. When we ordered, they keep asking us if we have ever ate at Japanese food and were very inpatient. The food were terrible as you can imagine. I will never go there again and just an alert to you when you see the excellent \"reviews\" below which I believe are all lame."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi restaurant! The owner is so sweet and friendly. The food was delicious and fresh. Coming from San Diego, it's hard to find a decent sushi restaurant but Yanagi sushi is a must!!! Oh and they serve delicious hawaiian poke!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out last night, it was my first time eating from here but I was in the area and heard good things. I ordered two rolls the salmon love roll and the lollipop roll. Both of the rolls were really good, the fish was really fresh. It took over 40 minutes to get the two rolls. But I will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi place on the Danforth. Fresh and so yummy every time! Good variety of rolls and their sashimi is excellent. I would say it's mid-range price for sushi in the city but the quality makes it worth it."}
{"text":"Very very disappointed in this sushi restaurant, I was there last night for the second time and probably had my worst ever dining experience. The sushi chef was very angry at a new waitress who actually seemed to be doing a pretty good job considering she was the only one waiting at least four tables and three customers at the sushi bar. The owner/ manager was sitting at the sushi bar with a customer couple. The entire time this manager woman was complaining (loudly) about this poor waitress and yelling directions to her. The sushi chef would yell at her in japanese and she clearly couldn't understand him and with each interaction she became more and more flustered and he would bang his sushi knife and slam things on the counter, it was horrible. The entire time he had a very angry look on his face and a demeanor as if he were going to blow up.  If I were the poor waitress I would have walked out! There was a customer next to me at the sushi bar who tried to help her by telling her what he was saying (I think this person may have worked there but was just in as a customer this particular night). At one point my husband asked if we should cancel our order or at least take it to go. Unfortunately we opted to stay

Most of the sushi was okay but we couldn't enjoy it due to the horrendous atmosphere! Hey instead berating someone who you think is stupid how about getting off your butt and actually training them, owner/manager lady and sushi chef!!??? Needless to say we will not be back.  I certainly hope the young lady waitress will realize there are much better places to work where you are treated with respect!"}
{"text":"Just had another great lunch at Yanagi Sushi.

Food was great as always and the staff was prompt, friendly and made a great suggestion (Bul go gi - sp?) for my bento box instead of the usual teriyaki chicken.

I really like the prompt service.  We enjoy a couple other near by sushi restaurants also, but we always have to plan for a much longer dining experience, which doesn't work well for lunch.

My wife and I both ate and were out the door for just over $20 (including tip)."}
{"text":"What a wonderful family-welcoming and extremely talented!  Excellent service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the best sushi place in the valley. Their sashimi is so fresh and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. You can tell that the owners, Jen & Troy, are truly focused on providing high-quality sushi. I've been to Yanagi about 20x, and their sushi has always been outstanding. I would recommend trying the salmon avocado, the tuna taco, the albacore carpaccio, and any of their sashimi (it's always fresh). The service is outstanding, and I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"There are many sushi restaurants in Gilbert. Each tries to differentiate by trying to be more original. As I traveled to Japan many times, the sushi bars in Japan are friendly from the time you walk in. At Yanagi Sushi you seat where you are told otherwise the waitress won't be happy. Even though the restaurant was almost empty, she insisted we sat next to another table that were having a personal conversation. They weren't amused either. So we insisted to be sat elsewhere. The food menu is nothing extraordinary. The sushi is average."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi and many different options. If you can make Happy Hour it's worth it! Service is excellent and they are always so friendly. We moved away from this neighborhood but still come back for how good it is. Ebi Ebi Love Roll is the best!"}
{"text":"We had the spicy tuna roll, crab roll, and spicy salmon roll.  They have complimentary salad and miso soup.  I also had seaweed salad.  Excellent service.  The rolls were fresh and the folks running the place were really on top of it.  Fantastic service excellence."}
{"text":"So unimpressed. I just threw out $30 worth of horrible, horrible sushi. It was foul tasting, smelling and looking. The tuna nigiri had bloody veins running through it. Super confused how this establishment has 4 star average."}
{"text":"Jennifer (the owner) came to our table and sang happy birthday! Staff is fun, food is great, and it is very affordable sushi."}
{"text":"This is my 4-yr olds favorite restaurant! We would be here everyday if she had her way. Instead we go at least once a month. Been eating here since they opened.

Love that I can get tako poke here. It is very hard to find. So ono!

Everyone loves the owner, Jen. She has a memory like an elephant. Knew all of our names after the first visit. She is so friendly. We love it here!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Excellent atmosphere, neighborhood feel, and they remember you!  Sushi is excellent.  Had a Yellow Tail Love Roll, and it was very fresh.....perfect!  Washed it down with a Sapporo."}
{"text":"Eh, not impressed. The food didn't taste bad but the portions were small and the prices were high. We even went during happy hour and their deals are what other restaurants charge normally."}
{"text":"Best sushi on the Danforth! Love this place, the sushi is always fresh and their maki rolls are delicious."}
{"text":"One of our favourite takeout places at First Markham!  Katsu is the best!  Teriyaki and Udon Noodles are good too!  Combos come with soup and pop/water!

Taste good! Great prices!  Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful service. The atmosphere is quiet, clean and private. Prices are a bit higher than many sushi restaurants, but well worth the few extra bucks. The only issue I might have is the tempura... A we bit on the greasy side the two time sthat I had it, but the rolls, miso and salad are spectacular."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for my son's birthday. Highly recommended, especially if you have kids, come after 6pm after the happy hour crowd. The place and service are family friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times but it's been months. I was greeted like an old friend and they always treat me this way.  I've never had a bad piece of sushi here. It is Japanese operated and it shows. 

The oysters are to die for. Prices are very reasonable for the quality and the taste. Both, quality and taste are impeccable. If you're looking for a sushi spot to hit up or just to try something new this is your go to. Don't waste anymore time trying to figure out where to go  - just go here!  It'll easily be the top five decisions you've ever made in your life."}
{"text":"The bf and I were in the mood for sushi and this place popped up as new in our neighborhood. We ordered one of the chef's sample platters of nigiri and sashimi, as well as a yellowtail love roll. The colors were vibrant, everything tasted so fresh. It was more than enough food for the two of us, and we have been known to put away more than our share of sushi. Jennifer stopped by to chat for a few minutes. I hope this place stays open- we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best sushi! Super nice people. Will definitely come again with friends and family. Sushi was so fresh."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi place to go out for a family dinner. The food is always great and the prices are lower than other sushi restaurants we have been to. Great service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Tried it based on the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed! Reservations recommended on weekends (for good reason). Sashimi quality was amazing and special rolls (Tiger, Maple & Crunch at this seating) was outstanding."}
{"text":"Best I've had in Phoenix! I got just about everything from the pictures. Went for a roll and ended spending 80 bucks - that good."}
{"text":"Love this place. Anytime we go in, Jennifer welcomes us with a hug. It 's a date night tradition for my wife and I. Highly recommend. The food is great and you don't have to mortgage the house to eat here."}
{"text":"Great place!  Sushi is good.  Service is always friendly!  Nothing like Hawaiian music, friendly service, and amazing sushi!  A little slice of heaven."}
{"text":"This review is based on my one take-out sushi experience. Surprisingly very good sushi and reasonable price. I had sushi lunch $12+tax. Comes with 10 nigiri, salad, and miso soup. I'd say the quality of sushi is pretty good for the price. I am always concerned about the quality of rice when I order sushi because many sushi restaurants use old hard rice that clearly had been sitting in the rice cooker for a couple of days. The rice I got with sushi today was just right. Soft and vinegary. No complaints. 120% satisfied."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. It was quiet and unassuming but it was FANTASTIC! We ordered 4 rolls all together and yakisoba noodles. One of the rolls was baked so it took longer but they brought the others out in short time. They were fresh, well made, presented well, and tasted amazing. The yakisoba noodles were for my daughter and she loved them. She ate over half of the generous portion and the server gave her a special jello treat when she was done. The cook and the sushi chef both came and spoke with us to make sure the food was delicious. The people are super nice and service was amazing. We'll likely return next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Great new sushi restaurant in the neighborhood! We used to order from Sushi Marche in Leslieville but it closed down for a bit and we were looking for a new spot. We have only done delivery, but it was very fresh and delicious! Ordered a sushi Moriawase, avocado and cucumber roll and a spicy tuna roll. Miso soup and green salad with ginger dressing was yummy too. Better than any other sushi spots I've tried in the east end."}
{"text":"Amazing place!  Sashimi was super fresh, the presentation is impeccable and the taste is fantastic .  Definitely I'll be a regular customer."}
{"text":"Bad. The service was shitty and the owner was demanding more tip when we left a good tip already just because we stayed during their closing time.  
Secondly, we went in at 8.20. By the time we finish our food it was 9.05 pm. And the owner was so rude to say that we took up 5 mins of his closing time and asked us to never come back.
That is so rude!!! What do u expect customers  to just leave what we are finishing coz its your closing time?? You bloody took 15 mins to prepare the order.
Totally rude sushi chef and never going back.

Edit: Jennifer, thanks for acknowledging my feedback. 

I understand that the food takes time to be prepared. We entered at 8.20 and exited at 9.15( this includes time taken to prepare food, eat, pay and come out). It was almost 8.45 when we got the food and no person could just gulp food in 15 mins. By 9.05 we wrapped up, We even took boxes as we didn't want to make the staff wait. It took 10 mins while we got the check and paid and left. We left a 5$ tip on a 65$ bill not because we don't know etiquette, a tip is paid for the service you get, and money is paid for the food you eat.  We have been thrice here and twice we got bad service. 

Are you saying that it is acceptable for me to receive bad service but unacceptable for the staff to receive a tip 2$ less??"}
{"text":"The chicken/pork katsu is the best that I've ever eaten in my life. The meat is pounded to thinness, and they use a very light batter to fry the meat, and it tastes delicious. For the price of $6.25, you basically get a whole porkchop with rice, salad, and your choice of a soup or pop. I recommend getting a soft drink because the miso soup doesn't really taste that good, but if you're ever in First Markham Place and don't know what to eat for lunch this is definitely the place to go! The owners are nice and it's a pleasure to give them my business."}
{"text":"I went to Yanagi Sushi for the first time last night.  The food was delicious, the service was great and it was a really nice atmosphere.   I have found my favorite sushi place!!"}
{"text":"This is authentic and high quality Japanese cuisine. Discover this form the green tea to the orange with your check. Lunch specials are excellent and affordable and the staff/owners are top notch people. I can't recommend this place enough. :D"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places ever. The owner Auntie Jen is so polite and so nice. The whole place is ran by a family. All Hawaiian. I love it so much 5"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place.   The service and food are top notch!   Fresh sushi in AZ is hard to find.   Not to mention Korean BBQ is spot on!"}
{"text":"This place is legit, Jen is so nice. Great sushi. Super clean and fresh, get that soju instead of sake. DO IT."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite new sushi place. Every bite is delicious. I drive 45 minutes from the west end almost every week just to eat here. Gets busy and service can be a little slow but worth the wait."}
{"text":"If you get the chance try Yanagi sushi!!
really good happy hour.. The staff was on top of it..  (GO MEET JEN!!!)
I had a sun rise roll... and if you love salmon like me, then get it! All this fish was really fresh! 
They also have filtered water....which beats the normal chandler water everywhere else!!!

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite sushi place in Phoenix. The quality and freshness of the fish cannot be beat here! The yellowtail is some of the best we've ever had. They get halibut, sea bass, etc, occasionally on special. The owner, Jen, is very friendly - she's always coming up with new things for us to try! It's a great locally owned place. The sushi chefs are awesome too! The regular menu has good stuff too, like yaki soba and fried rice."}
{"text":"Wow. Words cannot describe our disappointment in this restaurant. We tried the old restaurant and were underwhelmed, so decided to give the new owners a chance. It was a disappointment from the get go.

This was our experience from February 2016, but only getting a chance to post a review now.

Phoned in for a take-out order and were told it would be 40 minutes since they were a bit busy. We were a bit shocked at that but gave them the benefit of the doubt since it was a Friday evening. We went to the restaurant to pick up our order to find only 4 or 5 tables. We ended up waiting an additional 20 minutes. Really? An hour to get a take-out order at a place that wasn't even that busy? An earlier review also commented on understaffing and slow service. Is there only one chef running between the kitchen and sushi bar? They could see our obvious annoyance at having to wait and were nice enough to offer us a 10% discount on our next visit. Next visit? How about something for this visit??


Food was average. Nothing to write home about. The aftermath is another story. Our weekend was a write-off.  I am talking severe food poisoning here. One person recovered by Saturday evening. The other by Monday. Never in our lives have we experienced food poisoning this badly. We both work in healthcare so we knew this was bad and never have we ever been more tempted to go to emerg.


After a phone call to the restaurant to inform them, they were both sympathetic and apologetic. Still not enough to get us back into this establishment."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure. Sushi is very good and the service is excellent. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Sushi is always fresh and good!  It is very consistent. We have been to many places and will drive upwards of 35+ miles for good sushi on our date night. No need anymore because this place has become one of our favs. The owners Jennifer and Troy are great and really make you feel welcome. Try the spicy scallop roll made with the large scallops also the smokey salmon which is excellent. Just go and try....you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love sushi and love trying new places. Heard some good reviews so decided to give it a shot. Went in for happy hour on Friday afternoon wasn't to busy the place isn't that big. The owner and servers all greeted us as son as we walked in. They were very friendly and helpful. We ordered some sushi and sake, the sushi was very good the salmon was like butter it melted in your mouth. Overall the sushi was good and the presentation was on point."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Not only was the sushi delicious, the service was awesome!!! Make sure you try the Scorpion and Dynamite Rolls!!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in gilbert, everyone needs a great sushi place in their lives.  If you live in Gilbert, do yourself a favor.   Perfect neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Just got back from a delicious dinner.  We had a spread of nigiri, kalbi and mussels.  The nigiri was great, perfect rice to fish ratio, and fresh.  The kalbi was just like we remembered when we lived in hawaii.  Mussels were good but I'm used to the mussel being cut loose from the shell so a tiny complaint but the flavor was awesome ."}
{"text":"This is my favorite new sushi spot!!!! 

The sashimi and tuna love roll - amazing. My boyfriend and I always get the Samurai sashimi special. The fish always tastes like it is fresh and of very good quality. It is nice too because the sashimi special comes with a small nigiri plate as well. 

A lot of the rolls are okay, but the tuna love roll is wonderful. If you want to get a roll, this one is the ticket. 

I would recommend passing on the rolls though and getting the samurai sashimi special. You won't go wrong there!

Just fyi they are closed on Tuesdays. I have been there a couple times on a Tuesday craving their deliciousness, only to have my heart broken by the locked doors. 

4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say. I only give reviews if I feel the business is deserving of five stars. And this place certainly is. The sushi is top notch!! The fish is SUCH good quality and incredibly FRESH. Attention to detail has been given to everything, from the chilled soy sauce on the table to the laminated ordering sheet....sometimes its the little things that make a big difference. Jennifer, the owner, is so welcoming and makes you feel at home. The establishment is clean, the kitchen is spotless, and employees are friendly. Pricing is spot on, the menu is easy to read and they offer a ton of selection.  Don't pass this place up!! You will be a regular in no time!!"}
{"text":"I consider myself somewhat of a sushi (roll) snob and have been to a dozen or more places in the east valley.  Many were good, some not so much. The first time I went to Yanagi, I was beyond impressed. The ingredients were fresh, the veggies crisp, and the rice practically melts in your mouth. Since that day, I have never found another place that satisfies me like Yanagi. That's just the food. I have never EVER received poor service at this restaurant.  Jen is an angel and truly cares for her customers. I have never seen her disrespectful to anyone! I'm actually stunned anyone would give Yanagi a poor review. I guess even the best can't make everyone happy."}
{"text":"The food is alright. Not the best, not super quick. It's not too pricey, but you could find a better sushi place to go for lunch.

The service is terrible. Shortly after putting in our order, I asked if I could change an item to something else. The sushi chef said no, it was already in the computer. I let it go. After finishing our meal, we were still hungry. We order a White Dragon Roll, and something entirely different comes out. I try it, it's horrible. I asked, really politely, for a new roll or just to take it off the bill entirely. The owner and the sushi chef got visibily worked up and said no, I could not, because I had read the description and it's not their fault if I ordered something that I did not like. I paid $15 for a roll I ate one bite of, and promptly left."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place eastern toronto. The food is so good, really well made. The rice layer is really thin and the filling is more than what you would expect. I always had excellent service both when I dine in and when I take out. I would strongly recommend this place to anyone looking for great sushi at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Had the Yanagi roll,  twin tower roll and albacore sushi. All of it was very good! Also came with complimentary salad and miso soup. Service was very good and the owner came over to say hi as well! We normally went to ra but excited to have a good local sushi spot."}
{"text":"We just moved from Michigan to Arizona and this was our first sushi restaurant. It was excellent and the staff/service was outstanding. They even went so far as to recognize my son's birthday. Loved it and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great sushi place - both food and service are outstanding ! Been here at least a couple dozen times since they opened so I thought it's about time I yelp them.  I am a rather hardcore sushi eater and stick with traditional sushi. Here.-Hamachi is always buttery and melts in your mouth, Saba is perfect, and my personal test of freshness -Uni . Uni doesn't last long and you can tell when sushi chefs rotation has lapsed. This chef doesn't compromise on freshness- the Uni is always A+ & creamy good, 
As far as non traditional , spicy rolls and such. Usually I don't venture out of old school, but I've grown fond of Troys spicy scallops , sunrise roll , and volcano roll.
As probably noticed from other yelpers, Jen is awesome and I agree - she is - I wanted to point out the sushi is awesome too."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner. Got the boat for two and it was just the right size with endamame and assorted tempura, finished with green tea ice cream. 

Very quiet and service is very quick and polite. Will come again."}
{"text":"Dirty, smelled like chemicals, horrible service, too small (can't even back your chair up). Will not return. Manager gave attitude and disrespected my family."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Friendly staff, great service. The wasabi is some of the best we have had in the states! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I remember coming here during high school & recently came back. Nice and fast service, good sized portions. Ordered the maki set. Decently priced."}
{"text":"We just moved here from California in Dec. We have looked for a good Sushi place since arriving. . We finally found one! . The quality of food was great. The Twin Towers was amazing! I would highly recommend this to everyone. The staff was was outstanding and so cordial and fun. They have found customers for life."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great ambience, and attentive staff. I had the nigiri sampler which came with some good-quality fish. I also got a vegetable udon dish. It was wonderful. I had a great dinner here and will be coming back here for a sushi fix when I'm on the way home from work. Definitely the best sushi place I've found in the Gilbert area and a high contender for what I've sampled so far in the Phoenix metro area."}
{"text":"Wow! I never knew this gem existed in my neighborhood!

I decided to try it based on the raving reviews, and the hype is real! I luckily came on a wednesday night following a AZ Cardinals victory. this means that it's happy hour pricing all day. The sushi was quality and reasonably priced!

Better root for the AZ Cardinals or come at regular happy hour times!"}
{"text":"Love this place, best sushi in Chandler/Gilbert area. I always feel welcomed and they have great service"}
{"text":"Honestly my number one sushi spot! Staff is always so kind and welcoming, prices are more than fair and I never leave anything but happy and full :)"}
{"text":"Our first time here and it was a hit even with our 5 year old-she finished all her teriyaki chicken and they were cautious of her shellfish allergy. The owner and wait staff were so welcoming and took great care of us. The food was amazing! We had the specials, the salmon love, cherry blossom, and the golden dragon rolls! Soooooooo good!!!  We will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"We were one of their last customers, as we walked in at 915pm, and they close at 10 on a Tuesday.  Very nice ambience and friendly, but slow, service.  We waited over 35 min for our food - and the restaurant was serving its last customers.  Assume it would be a much longer wait if we came at peak dinner time. 

Ordered the Danforth boat for two - and it had a nice assortment of fresh sashimi, nigiri and the Golden Dragon sushi roll.  Salmon was especially yummy - tuna and unagi (eel) was so-so.  Didn't like the miso (too salty), and salad was quite sour.  They did offer yummy craft beers from Japan (Hitachino Nest).  Quite pricey at $10/330ml bottle, but worth a try as I'm not sure where else you could buy it.  

Prices are reasonable for food.  Would consider coming back again if I'm in the area and craving Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I saw the good reviews and came in 9:40pm to order some rolls to go. I was asking my family on the phone what they want to order. They do not have a complete menu online which makes very difficult to know all they are offering. I told them this is the first time I have been here, no help is offered until two minutes later, the server walked over and pushed me to order. The sushi chef behind the counter had a straight face and told me you have to order within a minute. 

I felt pushed because no help is offer or no commendation or whatsoever. 
I ordered four rolls and the fourth one I order the crunchy roll included shrimp which is fried. But the server told me the kitchen was closed earlier and they did not tell me when I first came in. 
How about dragon roll? Nop, kitchen closed. Only raw fish ones. Then I gave up and asked the server to pick one specialty roll for me. At the time the sushi chef came back again with an angry face and said you have it order now. We are closing the counter. 
I worked in restaurant and I understand there are timing kitchen staff have to follow. But nobody can treat customers with attitude like this. Very bad experience!"}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi and priced bit high as well. Nothing special and rolls are somewhat irregular. The environment is pretty cozy with good sake/beer/wine choices. Unfortunately kind of resort to this place due to lack of good sushi choices in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place! I order a California roll and the spicy edamame. It was delicious, the best I've ever had.  I'm already obsessed with the place and I've only been once. The service was fast and polite, and they all were very attentive to their customers. The prices were more than reasonable. Highly recommend this to anyone who loves sushi!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! This place is great.  I saw the review for this place I thought I would give it a try. I have read all the good reviews and some not so good reviews , but I go in there with an opened mind. And,  WOW!! What a great service! We sat at the bar, got to talk to Tony -the chef and then Jen came over to chat a little bit . Our server , I did not catch her name,  she was also extremely nice and very helpful . overall everyone in there was really nice,  great customer service. Then came the food OMG, every single bite we took was delicious. Our server and I discussed about how much we love spicy food.   a few minutes later, she came out with the complementary spicy edamame, which we loved.  We ordered spicy California roll, scorpion roll, white dragon roll,  shrimp tempura roll, and Las Vegas roll they were all super duper delicious."}
{"text":"I'll get straight to it:

Why 2 Stars?
- served tap water (tasted like sewer water)
- my wife and I were the only ones in the restaurant on a Saturday afternoon (approx. 2:00). I ordered a sushi roll and she ordered an appetizer. My sushi roll had 5 pieces of sushi that left me still desiring more and her appetizer about 5-10 after my sushi was served. 

The positive note:
- my sushi and my wife's appetizer were delicious. Very well put together. 

Unfortunately, this place falls short on service, portion size, and the fact that we were served dirty water. Sorry, but We probably be returning."}
{"text":"Dragon boat came with salads and miso soups! Good food and friendly staff. We just noticed they put a titch of wasabi on their sushi and rolls, but nothing you couldn't handle!"}
{"text":"Wow! Such a great lunch today! Sushi is oh so fresh and delectable. Spicy edamame is probably the best we have ever had. Ahi poke had me day dreaming I was in Hawaii and the rolls we had were top notch as well as the service! Jennifer is super sweet and was an excellent hostess. We were highly impressed and look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"This place has by far the best sushi I have ever had! It opened up a while ago and I went in during the opening and it was incredibly packed, but so very much worth the wait! I have since been back a handful of times and I've never had to wait, and the service is so friendly! I really can't express enough how delicious and fresh the sashimi and rolls are. I have been to establishments that are twice the price and half the freshness of Yanagi! I recommend the chef's recommended sashimi plates and the salmon love roll. Honestly everything I've had there is delicious!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best sushi I've had in a while. I had the pissed off cucumber salad (wasabi oil gives it a kick), autumn roll (with spicy tuna), and ika sushi (squid). It was delicious."}
{"text":"So glad we have a great sushi place in the hood. Wish I had discovered it earlier. I visited midday so had one of the lunch specials - spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls, comes with soup and salad. Everything was great, and the rolls were a great size. Just a note for anyone who isn't a fan of spicy - these were probably the spiciest sushi rolls I've ever had (which doesn't bother me) but just a heads up if you're not a fan of too much spice. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!!! Amazing bento box with many choices to choose from. Clean and not expensive at all. Be back many times!!"}
{"text":"Rolled in pretty late last night which I hate to do to restaurants as I always hated that when I worked in the biz.  Instead of sighs or body language of disappointment, my friend and I were warmly greeted. 

We sat at the Sushi bar and soon found out we were sitting next to Jennifer who is mentioned in many of the reviews.  Her friend was with her as well and we really enjoyed their company and conversation.  That after all is a big part of the sushi bar experience and exactly why I always sit at the bar.  

The food was excellent and they guided me to a few things I never do.  One was put spice and mayo on my scallops but it ended up being very good.  They also offered some samples to taste including a Saba that they pickle/marinate inhouse.  It was less oily than most and certainly more enjoyable.  

The Yellowtail sashimi was very good as were the salmon and tuna.  Typically Uni is hit or miss in Arizona but on a Wed this place had very fresh Uni and when paired with quail egg was luxurious and worth the trip alone.  

Can't say enough about the sweet people here and the good food.  Looking forward to more experiences and exploring the menu a bit more."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that Gilbert would have this amazing new sushi place? Sushi rice is pure perfection - melts in your mouth! The calamari is REAL calamari! The lollipop roll pure perfection!Fish is so fresh it's like we're on the coast! The service is EXCEPTIONAL! They make you feel like family! Great prices for a great selection of food! I will be supporting this delicious local family restaurant frequently!! So should you Arizona! 

ps the owner gave us a hug when we left..... How awesome is that!!"}
{"text":"Like this place because the food is good and the price is very good. I got a tonkatsu combo which has a choice of miso soup or pop and 5 sushi or 6 California rolls for $10. The katsu is good not oily at all, maybe because I came late and they have more time to cook better. The sushi is aright which I did not expect much for this price as long as quality is decent fresh. Would come here again for their katsu if you want good food but not pricey"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi!

Placed a pick up order for Medium tray (44pieces). Took about 40 minutes. Sushi was fresh and delicious. The rolls were well made with lots of ingredients. Very happy to find another good sushi place on the Danforth. Would highly recommend to others."}
{"text":"Everyone here is amazing! Jennifer is truly a celebrity! I have never had service like this! It was a pleasure to dine here. The food was phenomenal. I told her what I liked and she recommended the cardinal roll and it was honestly the best sushi I've ever eaten! This is definitely my new favorite sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"Small place in Gilbert but holy sh** place is amazing. Sushi roku can't touch this place"}
{"text":"Back for an amazing sushi lunch with Jenny. So happy she's back and feeling better. This is without a doubt one of the best sushi restaurants in the valley. New updated beautiful menus. Delicious photos of the different sushi rolls. Just a great place to come for a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"This place is amazeballs. Came down to Gilbert to meet up with family that just moved here. I suggested this place because of the reviews. Beats every sushi spot in Scottsdale hands down. Super fresh and damn delicious. We ordered steamed shrimp dumplings and tuna tacos. Both were fantastic, so we ordered a second tuna taco. We all shared a nigiri platter and a sashimi platter. Everything was fresh and firm and flavorful. We also had the lollipop roll and baked dynamite. Everything was on point, my only complaint is not living closer."}
{"text":"Very fresh fish and excellent service. Not that big but has some very good rolls definately recommend to anyone in the Gilbert area."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always good service, helpful and friendly. Delicious and fresh sushi with nice presentation as well."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of a sushi place just 5 minutes from my house, but every once in a while I am on the lookout for a new or better place.  

This place did not disappoint.  I looked at the Yelp images and saw the spicy scallops, salmon love roll, and the Hawaiian volcano.  They were all great.  The miso soup was miso soup.

My issue would be the price.  $15 for a roll is just too much.  Wanted to try the Pacific roll, but I think that one was $18.  The food was good and certainly comparable to my usual joint, but the prices were a little much. 

I could not have asked for better service--and a free rose and fried banana on Mother's day was a nice touch.  However, it looks like, once again, I cannot top my favorite place."}
{"text":"This has got to have one of the best quality sashimi in the valley. Hand rolls are a definite must. Daughter loves the California rolls (really?)
Hard to get salmon skin hand roll a must have! Spicy tuna hand roll is wife's favorite! This has become a staple for us! ( noodle bowls are awesome also! )"}
{"text":"We have heard that this place has great food, but unfortunately we were not able to try it.  We walked in at 2pm on a Saturday afternoon and nobody was there to greet or seat us.  We stood around for about 5 minutes hoping someone would show up but no luck.  We will try again another time."}
{"text":"Rude sushi chef. We get back from a long journey, stop by at 8.20pm for some dinner. We get a waitress who is absolutely terrible. Last time bad service from her, this time too we get the same girl. Food was okay. Coz we had bad service both the times we leave a 5$ tip on a 65$ bill. We left a 5$ bill coz they had to know about the waitress. This sushi chef had the nerve to come tell us not to come back again coz we left a small tip? Didn't we pay for the food we ate? We pay a tip based on the service we get. Absolutely terrible service n RUDE SUSHI CHEF! Get ready to get embarrassed if u leave a small tip for the bad service. He s gonna walk right up to ur car n tell u to never come back. According to them it's okay for me,a customer to receive bad service , but unacceptable for them to get a tip 1.5$ lesser.  Where's the justice in this?"}
{"text":"Loved everything we ordered! Great service too, also enjoyed the music! Jen was great! Spicy tuna tataki is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi restaurants tend to be hit or miss. Typically, the quality of the fish matches the price--low quality=low price The sashimi at Yanagi is the exception! The quality is excellent and the price is in-line with other Sushi restaurants. I am not a novice to Sushi or Sashimi--my ex-mother-in-law is Japanese--and I have a great appreciation for freshness, as well as variety. Typically, the sushi bars serve the same old sashimi platters. I have only experienced 4 Sushi bars where the sashimi platter varied from the norm--one in Upstate NY, one in Edmonton, Canada and 2 in Gilbert. Honestly, Yanagi and Sushiya are the only 2 that offer outside the norm. I will give Sushiya a thumbs up in that they allow for substitution according to price.

Still, Yanagi is one of our favorites and Jennifer, her Mom and our server make us feel welcome. They genuinely care about the patrons and remember you from your previous visit--not unlike our other favorite, Sushiya. We will be faithful customers to both establishments, but it's nice to see another Sushi Bar go outside the box. Kudos to Yanagi"}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM OWNER!!!
This is my second time coming here. Servers are completely oblivious to keeping customers happy.  We arrived during  happy hour and was asked if we would like to order anything off the happy hour menu. We asked for the HH menu. It took them 15 minutes to get us the menu. When we wanted to order the server told us there was only 1 minute remaining left of happy hour and that we would not be able to order. WHAT?!? I'm sorry but every place I have been to has always allowed us to order just before happy hour ends. 
 It took over an hour to serve us ONE roll. The roll was awful and tasted like rotten fish.  We each took one bite and told the server. The owner came over and said she couldn't take the roll off the bill. Um..you are the owner and can do whatever you want! After literally arguing with her for 5 minutes, which she also lied and said the roll takes 45 minutes to bake in the oven (extremely untrue) she took the roll off the bill.  In my opinion the owner is extremely cheap and does not care about customer service.  This place is a joke. I will never ever go back here."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in town. Enjoy it guys. Great customer service. Very clean place. I highly recommad this place to anyone that likes sushi."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I will be back. Service was very friendly and quick. I had the Las Vegas roll and tried the Cherry Roll. Both were delicious!"}
{"text":"I am always very careful about where I go for sushi, it has to be fresh for obvious reasons. This place came up on yelp with amazing reviews in its short time being open, so we decided to check it out.

It was about 730 Saturday night and the place was pretty busy, We were greeted immediately, there were seats available at the bar so that's where we went.  I had seen previous reviews that complained about the decor, I didnt find anything wrong with it and not sure what the other person was looking for.

While sitting at the bar the first thing you usually notice and look for is the fresh fish, but they didnt have that, instead there were plastic bins with various things inside, fish scraps etc.  I was a bit put off by that and wonder why the fish isnt there? Is it fresh?  We usually test sushi by ordering fresh salmon (sake) if thats not good the rest wont be, so ordered that along with one roll, Alaskan Roll.  I like that the menu explains exactly what is IN the roll and what is OUT of the roll. Miso soup AND a house salad (lettuce and ginger dressing) come with the meal which is nice, although the salad wasnt anything great, the soup was very good.

We received the Alaskan Roll and it was ok not our favorite but that is not the restaurants fault, we probably should have ordered something else.

I notice the owner thanking customers and even ran out to give one of her regular customers a hug, that was nice. We got to talk to her and she was a kind woman and grateful for the business.  Overall we had a good experience and the food was good and for only being open 2 months I am sure the kinks will work out."}
{"text":"I loved this sushi restaurant! The sushi tasted fresh and was very delicious. It was probably one of the best sushi places that I have had in Arizona. The customer service and waitresses were great and very friendly. My mom and I got a chirashi bowl, the sunrise roll and a yellowtail hand roll. They all tasted very good. I would highly recommend the chirashi bowl! It comes with lots of variety of fish and it is enough to fill you up. It is worth $15.95. The prices at this restaurant are a little more than other sushi places around the area, but for the quality that you get, it is worth it! I would recommend this place to other people and would come back again soon."}
{"text":"Rolls were delicious. Loved the Maple Roll. Sashimi was fresh. Can't wait to go back! Hopefully tonight :)"}
{"text":"Love this little gem of a place! Excellent addition to the east Danforth neighbourhood. Fresh fish, fair prices, good portions. When I asked for no surf clam in my sushi boat, the server kindly accepted my request and gave me an alternative. Service staff was nice and brought out the food in courses (miso soup first, then salad, then sushi boat), which I appreciate. Excellent timing. The only thing I wish this place had was a patio, but the indoor is comfy and inviting. I will be returning for quality and value!"}
{"text":"Food here is always very good. Great quality and quantity. I'm impressed, as I find it hard to get good sushi and sashimi. They offer a nice variety and the service was very helpful and friendly. 
The parking in this plaza can be a little tight, so be patient and careful. I've almost gotten hit with a crazy driver flying thru lot. ;-/"}
{"text":"Great little family restaurant. I've only been there three times and they already recognize me. Great Japanese food in middle of the city in Chandler."}
{"text":"Another hidden jewel! we were greeted immediately by EVERYONE. Seriously,  they all said hi as soon as we walked in! Sat down and even though it took a little while for them to get a drink order,  the visit continued to be awesome.  The owner (I assume), came to talk with us numerous times. She paid special attention to our 5 year old daughter with conversation,  even bringing her a box of crayons and a pad of paper to draw on. We started off with the jalapeño poppers. Yuuuummmmmyy! That's all I have to say about that! At that point,  I knew the food would be good.  We ordered the white dragon and the Ebi ebi love sushi. Both were scrumptious,  but the white dragon was Ah-MAZING (high pitched voice lol) ! We got it extra spicy and  that's exactly the way i would do it again! After dinner we tried the fried ice cream. That was just ok, because the outer part wasn't crispy like I'm used to, but it in no way changes my 5 star rating. The wait staff helps each other with all the tables, so I never felt like I was forgotten about.  It was awesome.  I can't wait to go back and have the white dragon again.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!  Right now I'm trying to convince my friend to play hookie from work today and go with me!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the east valley. The owner is great and treats her customers like family. I highly recommend the Albacore Sashimi, smoked salmon house special, Yanagis Crunchy Roll and the Rainbow roll.  We try to go during non-busy hours as they do get busy quick for obvious reasons."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for year with my dad for our occasional sushi date and it's AMAZING. The owner is the sweetest lady and always treats us with goodies. One time we ordered TOGO and they forgot our rice (we didn't really care) but the next time we came in some how she remembered and completely spoiled us with rice that day. Amazing service and the sushi is fresh and delicious!!! Try it and you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Went here the other week around 8:45pm ! I love that they are open until 10pm on weekdays! 

The service was great. The staff was very attentive and kept a smile throughout our meal. (I hate when you go out to eat later in the evening and you get the cold shoulder/ annoyed face from the waiters, but here they were exactly the opposite!) The owner was there and she was very sweet and let us a try a few things at no cost. I really enjoyed the Yellowtail Love Roll and the the spicy green beans! 

Definitely worth stopping by! Good sushi, great staff, and its open late!"}
{"text":"You won't find a better sushi restaurant in the East Valley, let alone the entire state. Although meager in appearance, Yanagi delivers with high-quality sushi, an outstanding and diverse menu, phenomenal prices, and--most of all--incredible service spearheaded by the owner, Jennifer. Every visit to Yanagi feels like we're settling in for a family meal. Oh, and did I mention the Happy Hour is incredible?!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best sushi !  Always served fresh.  The service is over top always a warm welcome !  Jennifer is fantastic always ones over and talks and recommends rolls. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"We recently moved here and have been looking for a good sushi restaurant. This is the place!! Great service, friendly and most of all delicious!!"}
{"text":"We read the good reviews about this place and figured we should try the place. My husband loved the sushi and said they were fresh. My boys loved the chicken fried rice and ate it all up. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great service and good happy hour specials. The sushi chefs sure know what they are doing and we were waited on promptly and attentively throughout our stay. We enjoyed a variety of rolls and sushi and each was exactly as advertised. What a delicious treat that you would likely miss if you weren't seeking it out. I'll happily eat here often and refer my friends without any hesitation."}
{"text":"We come here for lunch all the time. The sushi is above average.The owner is the nicest person and always takes care of us. I recommend this place to anyone close by!"}
{"text":"The food and service was fantastic! I highly recommend Yanagi.
My only complaint would be that the music was so loud it was difficult to talk."}
{"text":"Very much appreciated the owner's response to my original review, pointing out how I was wrong on every point. If I weren't busy I would go back and take a picture of the menu with basic rolls and appetizers not having descriptions but it's not worth it. I wish them best of luck and hope they keep up the great food and low prices! Sorry, won't be back!"}
{"text":"Been to so many sushu restuarants in Arizona and California. Nigiri was below average, (too much fat from a lean salmon and tuna), maki rolls were ok...there are better restaurants out there for the same cost. People were nice though!"}
{"text":"The owner Jessica is awesome! Fish is always fresh, pretty much everything is good. They get fish delivered everyday except Sunday if I'm not mistaken."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. We found this on Yelp. Sometimes I'm skeptical about tons of great reviews but we actually were very pleased. I am so happy we tried Yanagi today!  We were seated right away and the service was terrific. Food was AMAZING and really creative. I think I am a convert and will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"3.5 / 5

Pro: Ordered the Danforth boat for 2 people and it was the perfect amount. The salmon is so fresh and fatty, as well as the other cut of fish on the boat. The dynamite roll was small but it was nice and warm with plenty of fish roe on top! They also gave us free dessert in the name of love! For vday which I thought was very nice. It came with chocolate wafers, ores, red bean ice cream, and green tea mochi. Just a crap load of randoms but it was nice cause it was freeeeee 

Con: We waited 50min for our boat. The food is very good but I can see why they have so much takeout rather than dining in. The customer service is very slow. There were maybe 4 small tables of couples for valentine's including ours with two waitress and two sushi chefs. The Miso soup is very salty and the salad was acidic. My bf asked for more tea and they filled up his cup, looked at my half empty cup and walked away. I thought that was interesting... 

Overall: would I return? Maybe just for takeout."}
{"text":"Open late! Friendly! Delicious!

We found this place on Yelp on a recent work trip to Phoenix. Luckily, this place was open on a Monday evening to satisfy our sushi craving. I ordered the maki special and really enjoyed my spicy rolls. We shared the free edamame and my colleague had a roll and some egg rolls. Our waitress was super attentive and nice, giving suggestions about the area. If I lived nearby, I'd certainly return!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The staff and service were perfect. My dad is a huge sushi lover and he said the fish was really fresh and good. I got chicken teriyaki which was great. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sushi was mediocre at best. The water tasted like sewage water. The sushi chef was cranky and the service was lacking. Couldn't imagine what it's like when it's busy."}
{"text":"I didn't order any of the super cool items that I see in photos but did get a bento box so I could try different items. The beef dish (can't remember the names now) was very good. I even saved some to take home to my husband and he loved it. The spicy salmon rolls had a unique flavoring I couldn't place. It wasn't my favorite to the point of not taking any leftovers home. May be the first time I've left sushi behind. The other dishes were good. All in all, a good meal. Would want to try more sushi in the future, and find out what was in the spicy salmon so I don't get that in my food by mistake in the future."}
{"text":"So sad to be leaving AZ after finding this gem. Love the menu here and of course excellent customer service. My favorite is the albacore carpaccio! Keep up the good work and I'll visit when I am in town."}
{"text":"Cute place with a very friendly owner!  They have a lot of dressed up sashimi options to add some extra flavors to plain fish without adding the carbs.  The yellowtail carpaccio was amazing with fresh fish and ponzu and siracha.  Salmon sashimi wrapped with avocado was great too.  The best was the pepper-crusted tuna sashimi in some very yummy sauce.  The price of the specialty sashimi's were a bit steep however.  Other things we had were hamachi kama, yaki udon, and the chopped sauced tuna on fried wonton chips (name??).  Those were all decent as well.  My husband and his buddies had some $30 a bottle soju that he thought was the best soju he's ever had, \"It was very smooth and had a hint of sweetness.\"  Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"You don't come here for the sushi or the teriyaki or for anything else but for one thing and one thing only. The pork katsu (...and maybe the chicken katsu but mostly just the pork katsu). For only $6 you too can experience one of the best pork katsus in the GTA. Salad, rice, and a perfectly breaded pork cutlet. Is there really anything else you need in life?

I can't even begin to count how many times I've eaten here but I have never had a bad experience once and the owner is always super friendly. It will be a sad sad day in First Markham Place food court history if this place ever closes."}
{"text":"Came here the other night. Service was just terrible. No spoons were provides for my miso soup, and no cups for the soy sauce and wasabi. It took over an hour for our sushi to come out, and my daughters kids meal California roll was brought out AFTER we had paid for our meal. We were really disappointed and probably won't come back."}
{"text":"My favorite is the twin tower roll! I get it every time we go. The staff is amazing! Jenifer is awesome she does it all. She is almost always there to greet us unless she has to cover down on other people. I guess that's part of running a good restaurant. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone they have other amazing food if sushi isn't something you like they have other great cooked dishes."}
{"text":"The rolls we're really disappointing. For the price we expected something on par with Mi.Ne. It was ok.  Not bad.  But certainly not good. The reviews were very misleading and set expectations too high. Would not go here again."}
{"text":"I moved into the area at the beginning of the year and I tried 3 different sushi spots until I found this one. Search is over. I am in love. The staff is like family already and I have only been going there for a few months now. The salmon love roll is probably my favorite but everything is so fresh and definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"Everyone is SO friendly and welcoming. I stopped in for some udon when I wasn't feeling well and it hit the spot :) great flavor!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sushi place! The albacore garlic roll is great, so fresh, great customer service."}
{"text":"This place is amaZing!! Jen is such a fabulous owner. I've just been here once however my friends are regulars here and they were greeted with hugs, just a welcomed greeting all around!! The food, excellent! I can't wait to come back!!! Thank you."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this fairly new sushi joint.  However I was met with disappointment. 

Food:
The check-in said it was spicy edamame.  It was just regular salty ones. 
 I would like to have tried something a bit different.  The bento box with the ribs arrived cold.  The flavor was fine, but just not that great.  The gyoza came seemed like it was frozen ones and just reheated.  Not that tasty or special.  The fish in the chirashi were edible.  I didn't think the roe was that fresh though.  It had a bit of fishiness to it, which denoted that it wasn't all that fresh.  The other fish were ok.  Not one of the nicer grades, but at least it wasn't too bad.  It came with fairly small, thin slices as well.  

Service: 
Service was the part that really got me.  We waited forever for our food.  At least 30-45min.  On top of it all, the food was slightly lukewarm when it arrived.  The chirashi came last probably b/c they forgot the order.  I heard the lady announce the chirashi order at least 20min after we ordered.  They also forgot one of the bento boxes. Since it was very similar order with a couple of my other friends, they should've had them all come out at the same time.  It was only after we had asked to check up on the order, did they bring it out.  At least that bento box was warmer than the ones that came out earlier.  The earlier boxes were probably just sitting somewhere on a counter before bringing it out to us.

Maybe it was just a bad day or they got busy.  However it wasn't a good impression for my first time."}
{"text":"It's a nice little restaurant. They give you miso soup and a salad to start off your meal, very small portions. In comparison with the other sushi places I've been, it was okay."}
{"text":"the overall experience was good. server was very friendly and i got everything i need :) unfortunately i have to give 3 stars because the food was just OK. the specialty and the signature rolls were not as special as i thought it'd be, but i like the nigiri better (sushi and sashimi) as they taste fresher and more authentic ;)"}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem. Hands down the best sushi in chandler- phx for that matter. Jennifer is the Owner and is so friendly makes you feel right at home and hospitable.  The sushi is always fresh and the uni is always melts in your mouth. You must try the soft she'll crab it's heavenly!! Thank you to all the staff for always giving a 5 star experience!! Love this place, customer for life:-)"}
{"text":"Delicious! 

Our rolls came out pretty darn quick! Would definitely recommend this place for a quick lunch spot or if you are worried about a long wait. Personally, I was starving when we arrived so this was a major plus! 

We got the: Ebi ebi roll (pic attached)
The spicy tuna suffer jalapeño peppers.. and a spicy tuna roll + a crunchy roll 

All were super yummy! My husband reaaallllyyy enjoyed the stuffed peppers. That was probably the only thing we got I could've done without. All our rolls were super yummy and tasted really fresh. 
 
Price is pretty spot on for sushi in the area."}
{"text":"We just happened to walk in to this place to try it out. We were hesitant since we had our rambunctious 1.5 year old with us. We ordered sushi (spicy tuna rolls) and it was the BEST! It was fresh and actually spicy!! On top of that our lovely little started getting rowdy and the owner grabbed some cheese puffs (after asking), put them in a bowl, and showed him how to use the chopsticks like mommy and daddy! We actually were able to enjoy an entire dinner with our toddler!! It was the best experience and food. We will be regulars for sure!"}
{"text":"This place kicks ass!  My boyfriend and I decided to check it out after a long day.  The reviews just seemed to good to be true, but believe me, they are totally accurate. 

We ordered three rolls, the sashimi sampler, and the 6 gyoza appetizer.  The food all came out in what felt like 2 minutes.  The sashimi was honestly the best sashimi I have ever had in my life.  I wasn't expecting something so spectacular for the price but oh. My. God.  So good.  The rolls were so good we ate every single one, which is usually quite a difficult feat.  And the gyoza was super delicious too.  We also ordered some soju with Kirin light at the waitresses recommendation and were very pleased.  They have cute little measuring glasses to tell you how much soju and how much beer to pour.  It made the experience fun.  And man, does that stuff sneak up on you.  Be careful, fellow drinkers! :P 

Will definitely be coming back here.  The quality of the food (especially for the totally reasonable prices) and friendly, speedy service is, in my opinion, unsurpassable."}
{"text":"I've been here twice - once I ordered take-out and the other time I dined-in with friends. Both times I was impressed by the price and quality of their sushi - there are a lot of Sushi restaurants in this area, but this is my favorite! As the other reviews almost all mention, Jennifer is amazing and welcomes everyone. But the rest of the staff is equally kind and attentive. It's pretty casual and great for families too. This is now in my regular restaurant rotation!"}
{"text":"So thrilled to have such a quality sushi restaurant in our hood!
Great fresh sushi (thin rice layer!) great variety, oh so yummy, decent prices. Kid-friendly, excellent service, with a sweet toothpick-poked orange at the end to say thank you for coming. 
This is now our go-to, hands down!
Do yourself a favor, and stop by. And say hello to Stella and Daniel for me :)"}
{"text":"Another high quality dinner at a reasonable price. Fish is fresher at Yanagi, great attention to detail. Enjoy !!"}
{"text":"$9 for the sushi combo which comes with soup or drink. The soup is awful and bland. Just get the pop even if you don't like pop. The maki rolls are fine. Nothing extraordinary, Wasabi is weak though. The sashimi is ok as well. My experience here is just good. Nothing bad, nothing great. The combo is a good sized portion as well."}
{"text":"It is so great to finally have a real, great sushi place in Gilbert! We found this place by accident but we will definitely make it a regular stop. We had so much food, I can't remember it all, but it was all excellent and so fresh!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town for spring training, my 9 year old grandson decided he wanted to go for Sushi.  We found good reviews on Yelp and were not disappointed.  the food was great but what stood out was the service.  We had a waitress that was new and in training but the staff stepped in and helped when we needed explanations and recommendations on what to order.  Food was excellent and exactly as described.  When in the area again will definitely return."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to dine out here on a whim and the moment we walked in - we were welcomed as guests and were immediately seated. The waiters ensured we were being taken care of. The service delivered was professional and I must say I haven't had baked mussels that tasted so delicious before in my life. I also strongly recommend their house specialty; the White Dragon roll and their lollipop roll, which was different but no less delicious. I think this is our new spot for sushi!"}
{"text":"Koo-Koo_Cachoo you nutty bird.

Stopped in on our date night. Only ones here on a weekend? Ok, they're new I get it, maybe we'll get some special attention and some \"here try this\" sushi. 

nope

We got one on one attention with the owner. She sat down at our table and told us her ENTIRE life history. While my wife engaged in her conversation, I did not. This is our ONE night that we have no kids in the house or eating with us, in exchange I got a Asian woman with a truck load of problems that apparently needed to be talked about during my meal. 

On another note. We are the only people here the sushi chefs stood behind the counter like military guards waiting for our order........awkward!!! Every time I looked over at them, they were staring at us.

BUT.....the sushi was good, so were the drinks, no complaints about the food. The awkward situation of the staff and the owner will keep me from coming back in. I wish you all the best."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. We just finished our meal at Yanagi. We arrived there at around 4:30pm, restaurant was about 1/3 full with people walking in every few minutes to pick up their orders. We were seated immediately and were given the menus and were asked for our drink orders. The waiter gave us a few minutes to look at the menu while he grabbed our drinks. The menu has a lot of sushi roll options, definitely a good variety to choose from. The prices ranged on average between $12+ - $13+ with some options on the specialty and signature rolls being slightly more expensive at $16+ and if I remember correctly, the Las Vegas roll being the cheapest at $8+ when not during the happy hour. 

When the waiter returned, we were about ready to order. We ordered 5 rolls, Las Vegas roll (discounted during happy hour which is from open to 6:00pm on Fridays), the Yanagi crunchy roll, Alaskan, sunrise, and dynamite roll. All rolls were delicious, my favorite being the Yanagi crunchy roll! The sunrise roll had slices of lemon with it which gave it a very refreshing taste. The dynamite and Alaskan rolls were both baked, the dynamite roll slightly on the salty side. 

While we were eating, we were asked how the food was and we heard who seemed like the restaurant manager make nice conversations with diners who seemed like regular customers. 

Overall, very happy we tried Yanagi today. We believe it deserves its current rating and our rating of it. We will be coming back again soon to try the other varieties of their rolls which also sounded great."}
{"text":"We had the rainbow sushi rolls and cardinal sushi rolls. The flavor and texture of these rolls was nothing that we have had before. They just melted in your mouth like butter. Our sever, Charity was nothing but kind. And guess what? The owner, Jennifer came over and introduced herself and gave us hugs! We will be back, for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and each time the food and service were excellent! The owner is so welcoming, and treats you as if you are family.  I've tried many sushi places here in the valley and I keep coming back here because they know sushi!!  Yanag I has FRESH, buttery sashimi and other very yummy asian dishes.  Last night I had their 4 combo bento - salmon sashimi, ahi, mixed tempura and bulgogi.  They offered my mom and I a special mothers day dessert, but we were so full from dinner, we passed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently discovered Yanagi Sushi and I wish we had found it sooner!  The sushi is fresh and delicous (try the Autumn roll) and the owners and staff are friendly and fun!"}
{"text":"People are incompetent and rude.  Asked for seaweed salad and then afterwards would have the yaki udon.  So they bring the main entree minutes after she brings the seaweed salad, regular salad and miso soup.  Who does this?  No common sense.  So the entree sat getting cold.  No apology.  No follow up to see if everything tasted good.  

When I got to the entree, there were 2 brocolli stems each with 2 and 3 small stalks.  It wasn't even a full bulb, let alone there being only 2.  Then, there was about a few slivers of carrot and cabbage.  It was ridiculous.  So needless to say, I wasn't going to pay for that.  I brought it up to the guy behind the counter, and he was incredibly rude and unhelpful.  He refused to walk to the back and get the lady so that I could discuss it with her.

I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"We came in today for lunch as our usual sushi place was closed for some reason. 
We were a little disappointed they didn't have any lunch specials and were not serving from the lunch menu, so that made our lunch a little more pricey than expected.
I was pleasantly surprised to find out the meal came with salad and miso soup for all of us. The ginger dressing was perfect, I hadn't had that in a long time, and the miso soup was really good. Some places don't make it right and have too much or too little tofu and wakame...this one was perfect!
Kids teriyaki chicken was a little dry, however, its always hit or miss on that type of dish. Chicken katsu was good and the kids portion sizes were very generous! I didn't expect each kids plate to come with 8 cali rolls.
The decor could use a little work, the florescent gave it a little bit of a cafeteria feel and it was a little awkwardly quiet.
All in all I would definitely come back again, the sushi was much better than I expected however, it was a little pricey."}
{"text":"I ordered the chirashi don today, because I was feeling adventurous and wanted to eat a bit healthier.  Life Pro Tip: Don't order the chirashi don.  In fact, just order the chicken/pork katsu.  

The chirashi don costed ~$10.50, and I got about 12 pieces of sashimi - but not even the good sashimi - shrimp, egg, fake crab, snapper, and salmon.  The sashimi didn't taste the freshest either and was thinly sliced."}
{"text":"Leaving yanagi sushi completely and 100% disappointed. My husband and I were told we were not allowed to have a high chair against our table. We were not allowed to sit at a bigger table even though the restaurant was practically empty. Extremely rude service coming from the manager. I have never been treated so poorly in my life. We walked out before even ordering. If you are thinking about coming here, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and turn around. WORST place I have ever been to."}
{"text":"LOVE these guys!! The whole staff is awesome and so welcoming; Jennifer the manager is so sweet and makes you feel like family.  The waitress and sushi chefs were so funny and personable.  They really know how to deliver great customer service!

Food is awesome without a doubt.  We mainly ordered bentos (chicken katsu and Korean bul go gi) which made us so stuffed.  Sushi chef gave us a complimentary albacore tuna appetizer which was so tender and flavorful.  

Permanent customers here!"}
{"text":"What an amazing find in a shopping center! I'm a little nervous about small, hole-in-the-wall sushi places, especially in Arizona, but I was blown away by this spot. The service was amazing, the sushi was so fresh, and the prices were phenomenal. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Was looking on Yelp for a sushi restaurant in my not usual neighborhood & saw a friend gave this a 5 star so I had to try it.  She was right!!  Worth more than a 5 star!!  Sushi selection was SO good, service was excellent!!  Casual, relaxed atmosphere.  She didn't say, but I'm pretty sure it was the owner who came out to check on us.  Very kind & welcoming.  Spicy edamame is the best in town according to the boyfriend... and he's an expert!  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to find a practically neighborhood \"sushi joint\" just up the road from us!  It used to be that there was no really fresh fish in Arizona but there is now.  A lovely, cute little restaurant, bright, clean and inviting, that's Yanagi.  Available are 8 bar-stools to watch the action, plus 2 tables for 2 and 9 tables for 4, that's it.  The wait staff consisted of 2 young ladies and a college age looking gentleman, who were friendly and efficient and very personable.  It was a Friday early evening about 5pm and we were still within their Happy Hour!!
Monday thru Friday 2pm - 6pm.  We both ordered iced green tea, wonderfully refreshing.  For starters I had Miso Soup, rich in flavor and depth and my wife had the house salad with an interesting ginger dressing.  Both these choices were on the small side but great in flavor.  Next, Salmon Kama, the tastiest and meatiest broiled salmon collar we have ever had!  A platter with 2 pieces of salmon nigiri, placed between a shrimp tempura roll and a spicy salmon roll.  Another plate, boat shaped, of 6 pork gyoza with sauce, crunchy outside, soft and delicious inside.  What a feast, everything tasted fresh and delicious. For desert we ordered 2 desserts, Deep fried Ice Cream, a large portion of sweet vanilla ice cream enrobed in a sweet crispy batter, topped with whipped cream and a cherry, and a large Mango Mochi, quartered and also topped like the ice cream.  With tax this feast was just under $28, you gotta be kidding!
What more can I say, go early, enjoy, and return often, I surely will."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! Just picked up the Danforth Sushi  for 2 and it's delicious! The take out platter offers a very good selection of
sashimi, sushi and a large maki roll.  The fish is extremely fresh and the nice touches such as the flower and Japanese maple leaf make this place stand out! Most sushi places can learn a thing or two from Yanagi! 

The decor is very nice and welcoming and the staff are very 
courteous and professional. We'll have to come back to dine at the restaurant soon. This is our new go to place for sushi take-out night for the wife and I."}
{"text":"Loving this place. The sushi was great and the dressing for the salad probably has Crack in it it's so good and addictive. I'll be swinging back in soon."}
{"text":"Have been looking for a new sushi restaurant to go too!  We saw the reviews and gave it a try!  We were not disappointed!  Our table had a number of rolls and also nigiri!  All were so fresh!  I fell in love with the Salmon Love Roll!  Wished I would have taken I pic of it because the presentation was beautiful!  This is truly the best sushi I've had in the 15 years I've been eating sushi!  Jennifer is so friendly and made us feel so welcome!  I already feel like family after one visit!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for many years now. I usually order the salmon avocado handroll. The avocado is always perfectly ripe and the salmon is always fresh. Price is reasonable as well. 

The pork katsu is AMAZING for the price, if you're ever in this area, go try it. It's not the place you go out of your way to try, but if you're ever in this mall, it's a definite go-to."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and super affordable, but the best part has to be the staff. So friendly and welcoming. Oh, and the music playlist was awesome too."}
{"text":"Love their chicken katsu. This place is located inside the first markham place food court and has been here for at least 15+ yeara. The chicken katsu comes with huge chicken, rice, salad and a pop. Always fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"This place surpassed my expectations by a mile. Very decent meal, the sushi rice was flavored very well. The sushi rolls and bibimbap were exceptional for the neighborhood. This is a huge step up from the previous owners IMHO. The Servers were accommodating to our two little ones.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very fresh food. Seats about 40ppl. Quiet environment.  Got the Danforth boat; cost about $50 with tip & drinks included. Will be going back"}
{"text":"Service was prompt and professional. Solid place for sushi and some nice non-sushi surprises on the menu, like the the mushroom butteryaki."}
{"text":"Food is great and service is personable and awesome!  They have the best Unagi I have found in the east valley!"}
{"text":"I've been dining at Yanagi more times then I can remember. This is my go-to sushi spot and every time I bring friends and family they are always impressed. Jennifer, the owner, is amazing! Whenever we come in she greets us with friendly hospitality. We order A LOT and it always comes out in a timely fashion. Today was the first time we ever sat at the sushi bar and I recommend it for a small date or dining alone. It's fun to interact with the sushi chef and watch him make everything in front of you. I usually order the Samurai, it's a sashimi and nigiri combo plate. Then I mix it up with different appetizers and rolls. I love the baked mussels and the dynamite roll. You'll never be disappointed spending your money here!"}
{"text":"After managing in sushi bars for over 6 years I've become somewhat of a sushi snob. It's very hard for us to find sushi we enjoy and keep returning for. I have to admit I was definitely impressed. The food was amazing! Everything was very fresh and outstanding presentation. Being that it was a full house on a Friday night everything came out quickly. We especially liked the tuna tacos (ahi poke) and the sunrise roll.

My husband and I have both been in the restaurant industry for a very long time and although we are understanding when it comes to service levels, we also expect minimum basics. Service started out rocky - we wondered whether or server had any experience before. We asked for recommendations and he had none and admitted he hasn't tried any of the food - not something we line to hear from an employee of the joint. Slowly it became a team effort by the staff and other severs were better and actually knew the menu. The owner Jen was very friendly and welcoming. We didn't receive terrible service - but hoping it will get better as they iron out the wrinkles. 


We'll be back soon and hope that the food quality stays the same and service improves."}
{"text":"Good stuff! I looked this up on Yelp and the reviews didn't lie! The rolls were fantastic, the yellow tail was a light peach color, the salmon was salmon colored and not the red color of older less fresh salmon.  Very friendly staff and the owners were there as well. 

Moving from Colorado back to AZ I was a bit sad since the caliber of sushi in AZ is not as good as CO. Then I found this place and it is awesome!!!  Great sushi, great staff highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place after seeing good reviews. It was a very quiet lunch coming here 1 hour after it was open.

Me and the gf split a lunch special as well as one of their special maki rolls.

Sushi was excellent, and so was the variety of the lunch special. Service was great. 

Would recommend."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and to be honest I have been craving their maki rolls ever since. I am definitely planning to come back.
Service is Excellent, servers and chefs were very friendly and welcoming.
We tried sashimi, sushi, maki, karaag, caramri, tempura udon for dinner. Loved them all especially my children really loved them. You can definitely taste the high quality and effort they put into their menu items."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday. It was a little out of the way but since we already had plans on the Danforth, it worked out. 

Now, we usually eat ayce but thought we'd give this place a shot and unfortunately, I forgot to take pictures. We had some salmon, surf clam and shrimp sashimi which were all pretty standard. An order of the japchae, I think that's what it's called (glass noodles), gal bi, a dish that resembled beef bulgogi (but wasn't) and assorted tempura. Food came with bowls of rice, salad and miso soup. 

All the food was delicious. Our waitress was very attentive and the chef even sent out a complimentary salmon carpaccio, which was very tasty. It was about $90 between 3 of us, so price wasn't bad at all. And we got some delicious orange slices with the bill. I would definitely eat here again if in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome hole in the wall sushi! Open pretty late too. 

Ordered the Alaskan and fire cracker rolls and mixed tempura. Not only were all three dishes phenomenal, they came out quickly and the staff made sure we were satisfied. 

The best part of this spot is the good vibes and overwhelming welcoming feeling.. our server turned out to be the owner, Jen, who gave us the best personal service and was a joy to be around!

10/10 would recommend to anyone in the valley."}
{"text":"Today was another fun Saturday.  We went to look at some outdoor furniture and checked out some bicycles and got myself a game head phone at the Best Buys.  We were feeling Sushi for dinner and I'm always happy to try new Sushi places.  My husband got a recommendation from his friend because this sushi place have Korean foods too.  We arrived there little after 6pm and my husband ordered Bento with Spicy Chicken and I ordered appetizer Baked Mussels and Caterpillar rolls.  I know we said we were feeling sushi but menu looks so good, so we changed our mind to some cooked items.  

I enjoyed my hot cup of green tea and checked this restaurant out.  I like the decor but did not like how open the bathroom was.  I wish they had a screen or something so that bathroom is not so easily viewed.  And I noticed there was a lady who might be owner or manager who was very busy talking to customers going from table to table asking if everything was okay and just chatting with the customers.  That is always a good sign.   Then about 10mins my husband's food came out.  I thought that was strange since Appetizer wasn't out.  So we picked at his food while waiting for other foods to come out.  Spicy chicken was sooo salty and there was almost no chicken.  It was mostly vegetables.  I do how ever liked their octopus salad.  It was refreshing and yummy. We waited... and waited... and we were eating really slow  but my food still didn't come out.  Well after we were done with his bento our waiter asked how was everything.  He asked that like if that's all we ordered. Then he notice I was not happy, actually I was mad so he ask if I ordered anything. 

HELLO! You took my order!!!  I said yes I ordered appetizer and a roll.  He said he'll check on it, didn't even apologize.  Then comes back and said the baked mussels were in the oven and they always take time so it'll be another 5 mins and he'll get the rolls.  Rolls comes out like 15 or 20 mins later and I am fuming.  I was tire, and just exhausted from this waiting.  The lady finally comes to our table and asked if everything was okay and if we need a water or tea.  I said no thank you and my husband ask if our appetizer is done yet?  She said she'll check and then another waitress comes and asked if everything was okay.  My husband asked again regarding the mussels and she comes back and said it will be about 5 mins because baking takes time.  When mussels finally arrived at our table I was done.  I asked for to go box for those mussels and paid.  We even gave them 20% tip when they deserve nothing.  I just wanted to go home.  When we got to our car which was parked right front of the restaurant it was already 7:40pm.  So my mussels took more then 50mins to cook???  As you can see I didn't eat the mussels.  The mussels that is \"supposedly\" cooked for over 50mins was not fully cooked.  I don't know why but outside the mussels were warm but inside was cold.  Like it was frozen or something.  I couldn't eat it so I throw it away.  I was soooo disappointed.  I love baked mussels.  We will never go back and just told our friend who recommend this place what happened."}
{"text":"The sashimi is where it's at here. It's fresh, and it just melts in your mouth. I got a boat for 3 to share with one other friend and it was way more than enough. The prices here are definitely worth it for the quality you get here."}
{"text":"Sushi was OK, but I know it's hard to find a sushi place in Chandler that has California standards. But overall, quick service and fresh seafood."}
{"text":"First coming, the staff was attentive in getting us sat down so when I saw the reviews of the staff I questioned why so many people said bad things about them. But then when I ordered vegetable fried rice, I was given chicken fried rice. And decided not to make a fuss but the second I took a bite they came back and said did you already eat off it and it was meant for another table. (Btw despite the 5 stars on the chicken fried rice I thought it had no flavor what so ever). Then when I received my receipt I was only charged for the veggie fried rice ($1 difference) and she took my card and came back to the table and while having my card changed what I was charged for to the chicken fried rice. It was there mistake, and charged me and didn't inform me before charging my card. Not ethical at all. Don't know if I came on an off day because there are so many glowing reviews but I won't return to find out."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Came with a party of 4, got the Spicy Edamame and Shrimp Dumplings to start. Loved both. For the rolls, we got a few of the basic ones and loved every one. The owner is super kind and very knowledgeable of her menu. Loved having her as the server. The Hawaiian Volcano, Spider Roll, and Fire Cracker were amazing. Overall one of the best sushi places I've been!"}
{"text":"Good little sushi place.  The owner is very sweet.  The atmosphere is just ok. I don't like sitting at the tables because I like to watch the sushi chef prepare the sushi. True artists!  The waite staff seem to try to please but a little chaotic.  While several servers seem to check on us, one didn't seem to know what the others were doing.  They should each be assigned to a section and leave it at that, while the owner overseas everything.  Considering it was a little busy but not packed,  I would be less likely to go on a Friday or Saturday night. 
The meal itself was awesome.  Each dish/roll were presented beautifully and delicious.  Perfect portion size for each roll.  However,  edamame should always be given as part of the meal.  I shouldn't have to ask and it shouldn't be an extra charge.  If they adjusted the price of what it costs them, into the other prices,  it would make the customers feel like they're getting a freebie. 
Overall,  a nice place!"}
{"text":"So far, it is the BEST sushi place in our area, in my opinion!!! The food was soooo good!!! And the owners are very friendly ! I enjoyed it so much I would give it 6 stars, if I could!"}
{"text":"I'm also looking to find great sushi in the east valley. Yanagi Sushi is, by far, my new favorite. The sushi is inventive! And it is so fresh - I think the fish is right off the boat. If you love great sushi, you have to try Yanagi's. You'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"This is the only sushi place I will go to!! The customer service is impeccable. The quality Is amazing and the prices are great. I love how the owner Jennifer is always there making sure people are getting taken care of AND she treats everyone like family. 

The experience overall is excellent! If we could afford it we would come here every night. 

I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food but the service is REALLY SLOW!!! Waited for more than an hour just for the food to come. They should hire more staff specially their kitchen staff instead making costumers wait."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on Yelp a month ago. Tonight, we went there with a large group. Everything was so good, and the staff was so friendly as well. We appreciated for the complimentary drinks and foods as well. I have never seen such a friendly sushi restaurant so far. BTW, we tried more than ten rolls and three sashimis. All were fresh and delicious. We loved the Korean drink shochu served as a complimentary drink."}
{"text":"We frequented this place about 10 times in the last 3 months and we will not be coming back because the terrible service.

Pros: The sushi rolls are better than average. The rolls we regularly ordered were the Cherry Blossom, Lollipop Roll, and Sashimi Salad. Very tasty. However most rolls are spicy; do not recommend if you dont like spicy.

Cons: This establishment struck out with us on 3 separate occasions. 1) We were finished eating our meal and their internet connection server went down; they kept all their customers for over 45 minutes without exaggeration while they attempted to troubleshoot their issue; in the end they wanted us to sign our name on a blank paper along with our credit card information. Lastly, they damanded a tip although we were held their for more than 45 minutes 2) the server was inattentive to our table, didnt refill our water, check to see if we liked our food, or probed to see if we needed something else. When we called her over, she half listened and walked away in mid-sentence 3) the last time we frequented we waited for close to an hour before we received our first roll, the table behind us also complained and the server didnt apologize for the wait. She came to us and apologized multiple times for the wait. In the end, they made no attempt to compensate for the extensive wait as customarily done at other locations.

Service is a 1 and food is a 4."}
{"text":"This place is a rare find.

 First of all, the staff is supper friendly. Jennifer will greet you, ask your name, remember it, and make you feel welcomed. That's before the food is even tasted. 

The food.  It was great. Super cheap prices make you think it will only be average. Nope. It is fantastic. I tried the crunchy, California, avocado, and spicy tuna. Spicy tuna is my favorite sushi roll. Most places nail the flavor but have no spice. The flavor was great on this one. Not only that, but the spice was there too. It was not overwhelming, but it was there.  The price was right for all of this. 

Lastly, on the way out, we all got a hug for coming. Did I mention that the staff was friendly. This is one of those places that not many people know about, but is going to blow up with business. Just watch. Give it a shot. You won't be disappointed at all. Trust me."}
{"text":"Sushi here is fantastic! The salmon love roll was definitely the best we had ordered, but Las Vegas, and Cherry Blossom were also tasty. Dynamite roll was good but not my favorite. The sake we ordered was smooth and dry, just how we prefer it. Service was kind and attentive. We were surprised there wasn't a wait for this place but happy to have enough room to dine with our two kids. We will be back."}
{"text":"Five star staff and food. Best happy hour prices-full portions-large variety in HH menu. All items full portions. Appetizers,regular rolls and drink combos 2-10. Apps mostly under 5, rolls 3-6, drinks 3-12. 
Staff aStaff accommodating to kids, sushi chef saw how happy  my kid was to watch the chef and he gave her a slice of octopus. She thought it was the best thing ever. Staff always personal and treats as guests not just customers. Music a tv and dim lights for dinner-good ambiance. Clean restrooms and dining area. Our #1 sushi spot in AZ."}
{"text":"If you're hungry, you should be here! It's awesome! The food is excellent. The owner is amazing! Prices can't be beat for what you get!!"}
{"text":"High quality fish and great service....  My daughter and I had dinner here before a concert last night at Mesa Arts Center.  Our experience and dinner were excellent.  I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I had their chicken katsu bento box and their crunchy roll and I liked both of them a lot! Their gyoza that came with the chicken katsu was the best I've had! Good job!"}
{"text":"Service was super speedy and friendly.  We had a table of 7. Food came out at proper temperatures.  Fish was super fresh.  Mochi as a great ending to an excellent meal.  Will return."}
{"text":"The wife and I were looking for a sushi spot near our home in Chandler. Our favorite sushi is from Kobe in Ahwatukee. We haven't really been able to find a sushi restaurant that's on par with Kobe around us. That is until this past weekend. 

The sushi was very fresh and made very well.

We did the special where you can get three rolls for $14.

Very good deal!

We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"I love sushi again, and Yanagi is the reason why.  When I saw this place opening in my neighborhood I thought, \"Oh great.  Another Sushi place...\"  Not sure why, but I'd lost that lovin' feeling when it comes to sushi.  Last week my wife said she was craving the stuff, so I hit up Yelp to see what was good in our hood and was happy to see that the new place was rating high.  I went in with high expectations and they blew them out of the water.  Our server was friendly and attentive but not overly hovery.  The owner (I assume) stopped by at one point to check on us because she noticed we hadn't tried our spicy edamame yet (which was the best edamame I'd ever had - slathered in a kind of oily spicy sauce that truthfully didn't look awesome but was beyond delicious and highly addictive, and while it had heat it was not too hot.)  I digress.  Anyhow, she was super nice and just wanted to make sure we liked everything.  The reason we hadn't touched the edamame yet was because it came out with our first two sushi items, salmon nigiri and Tuna Love roll, and we couldn't get away from the Sushi to try the edamame.  The nigiri was like butter.  I could tell by looking at it that it was an amazing cut and super fresh.  The roll was delicious and also an impressive presentation (looked better than the picture.)  On her urging we finally tried the edamame and it didn't last long.  Next up was the dynamite roll which was also amazing with baked scallops on top and perfectly tender and delicious.  
What a hidden gem!  I haven't been this impressed with a new restaurant of any kind in a long time.  Great service, very good prices, amazing food.  I've been eating sushi in the valley since Kyoto's in Scottsdale was about the only place, and I've had some really great sushi along the way, but I seriously think this was the best ever."}
{"text":"We order Danforth boat for two every Friday and the quality is very good at all times.  Unfortunately their prices went up. Danforth boat was $42 and now $48."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Everything is so fresh and the crunchy roll is to die for. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place has been open 4 months and we tried it out after seeing the pics and reviews on Yelp. 

The fish was well portioned, very fresh and had a few twists. The staff were very friendly and on a Monday we were surprised to see 2 families with young kids come in. I always love seeing kids excited about eating sushi! 

10% off on Mondays & Tuesday's with Yelp check-in. 

Really great addition to the neighbourhood that has been lacking a good sushi place too long!"}
{"text":"'Twas bomb diggitty! I'm from California and I have had some of the best sushi. I was very impressed with the service and the quality of fish being in Arizona. I would highly recommend this sushi joint"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

This review is for take out sushi.

We walked in and opted for take out because the place was packed. The restaurant is bigger than I thought with about 10 tables and bar seating.

We ordered the Danforth boat for 2. In total, the cost was $48 including tax and tip.

We waited about 20 minutes for our food.

The meal came with two miso soups and salad. The sashimi was very good quality. Not frozen. Fresh. I liked the seared tuna pieces. The dragon roll was crispy and big. I didn't like the rice because it was a bit hard. 

Overall, this is a good quality sashimi place. The price itself is more expensive than sushi bay (on coxwell and O'conner), which is what I am comparing this place to because they are close by. I get more from sushi bay in terms of what I pay, but this place's quality beats it."}
{"text":"Wife and I had a craving for sushi rolls so decided to visit Yanagi's. What we ordered: calamari, salmon kama, spicy salmon roll, spicy yellowtail roll, and tempura roll. The calamari had a good fry but it was very chewy (overcooked most likely). The salmon Kama was very small and did not have much seasoning at all. While the spicy yellowtail was delicious, the spicy salmon was not spicy at all and what was worse was the salmon itself was room temperature :(. The tempura roll tasted average and wasn't anything to write home about. 

Overall, the service was good, but the food wasn't that great honestly :(. There are better places out there in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great food! Service was on top of things but the food was a little slow because the restaurant was pretty crowded. Will definitely be back though. The salmon love roll was beautifully presented, and tasted amazing. Samurai Sashimi platter was on point, good portions, well priced and fresh. :D Awesomeness."}
{"text":"The delicious sushi is only surpassed by the warm, friendliness of the owners.   Definitely our go to when it comes to sushi."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite sushi place anywhere. Jennifer and Troy treat us like family. Outstanding combinations of sushi and always something new and different every time I go. Beautiful presentations, amazing tastes, and wonderful people. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"The ramen is amazing! I love this restaurant! The atmosphere is very nice, food is awesome and the service is friendly and fast. I will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place. Jennifer and Troy welcome my family every time we come in. My son doesn't like sushi, but no worries cause he loves the pork cutlet. I enjoy the white dragon roll and the salmon avocado sushimi."}
{"text":"Great service and very very very fresh sashimi! Tried monk fish liver and live abalone for the first time amongst my other usual faves, salmon, yellowtail, eel sushi, butter scallop. The owner is SO nice and friendly!! I can't wait to come back to support this cute mom n pop shop."}
{"text":"The food is great and they have my favorite, Tamago. I always go for HH and my bill is always very reasonable for what I eat. Also very friendly to kids and offer them a special treat if they finish their dinner. I really recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Sushi / Sashimi in the area. My husband and I have been here twice and both times we've had outstanding food and service. The portion for Sashimi is perfect! The slices are thick and cold just like you'd hope to have. The rolls are delicious and filling!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, fast and friendly service and great prices!!    This has become our go-to sushi place in the east valley.    You can't go wrong here --- Nicely done Yanagi Sushi!   We'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Wow! This is a gem in Danforth! The Danforth Boat that we ordered contains 10pcs sushi, 15pcs sashimi and a large dragon roll. It's 42 bucks with miso soup and salad for two people. Very reasonable price. More importantly, sashimi are thick and fresh. The only thing that is not quite right is the sushi rice, but I'm not going to blame them for that. As for $21 per person, the quality of their fish is far beyond my expectations! 

If you love sushi, you have to check this out."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I feel about this place. I go back and forth. The sushi is fine - we ordered the rainbow roll, the salmon roll, las vegas and a couple of miso soups. The sushi was average for the Gilbert area... nothing extrodinary but the prices are a bit high for what you get. I'd understand if it was 'quality not quanity' but I don't know if I can go that far to even say that. It was a pretty expensive lunch for three people and we decided we'd rather go to Blue Wasabi or even Kona if we just wanted average sushi."}
{"text":"This place has fast become my favorite Sushi place in Gilbert! Great food and wonderful service everytime. The owner, Jennifer, is wonderful and makes every trip memorable."}
{"text":"Such great sushi and love the staff they always recognize me and my family. I recommend the tuna tataki it is to die for!! Definitely one of my favorite sushi restaurants"}
{"text":"Amazing, delicious and fresh sushi. Great service and always have a memorable experience!"}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying I don't write a whole lot of reviews. After eating at Yanagi I felt like it would be a crime to not at least give these guys a pop.

This was some of the best sushi I've ever had. It was also some of the most reasonably priced, outside of the revolving bars. Being as it was my first time there, I went with my safe bets - the spicy salmon and the spicy tuna. 

I can't say I got a lot of spice on either, but the fish was pretty much perfect. It was unbelievably tender, with flavor to match. The rice was cooked just right. The service was friendly. The preparation was a little slower than I've seen at other spots, but it was 100% worth the wait. 

Go eat at Yanagi."}
{"text":"Had the yanagi roll and tuna love... Sure is love!!! Super friendly and welcoming... really great atmosphere. We also tried the sayuri saki... delish! Best sushi ive had in Phoenix in a while. Great date night for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! The sushi is amazing and the service is wonderful. They make me feel at home :) I miss this area because of this sushi redtaursnt"}
{"text":"This place is great. We got in on a Saturday night quickly and I ordered a bento box and my husband got Pork Katsu along with sushi.  The service was great- when the food came out a little late we were given a hot appetizer (we were enjoying ourselves and it didn't seem long to us but they apologized).  Best sushi in Gilbert."}
{"text":"First off amazing sushi, some of the best in the valley.  Very fresh and put together well.  Secondly the service is above and beyond.  The owner took our 6 month year old around while we enjoyed our meal.  Great people and great food.  Very happy we tried it!"}
{"text":"\"Hair in food alert** server/owner has black messy hair that should be contained with a hair net. That said, I've been to this restaurant multiple times getting both carry out and dining in. Today, I dined in with a friend and we were the only two in the restaurant. Both ordered Bentu boxes. To set the stage, I was wearing a baseball cap and my friend has blond hair. Long story short mid way through my meal I discovered a medium length dark black hair. The lady server (quite possibly the owner) came over and made the biggest , over the top production about how it wasn't her hair. The hair was hiding in my rice.... given that she was the only female worker with black hair I can only conclude it was hers. Instead of apologizing like a normal person she implied that the hair was planted. Anyone that knows me, knows I don't mind paying for food. Due to this experience of 1) hair in my food and 2) the mishandling of the issue by a poorly trained employee or owner I won't be back. It's unfortunate because my prior experiences were fine. Lastly, she did take 10% off my $23 dollar bill but from my perspective too little too late. I'll take my dollars elsewhere. #notyanagi"}
{"text":"I went here with my toddler and we ordered, chicken gyoza, crunchy California roll and Hawaiian volcano roll. The gyoza was delicious and crunchy. My son liked the crunchy California roll. When I ordered the Hawaiian volcano roll I didn't realize it was cooked, but it was so delicious! There is a thinly sliced piece of lemon under the sushi that you can't see in the pictures that gets cooked with it. It was phenomenal and a great mix of flavors, it was tangy yet spicy. Their miso soup and salad is good as well, my toddler devoured their salad! The service was excellent, my son had to use the bathroom and I told the waitress we would be back. When we came back, someone had cleared the table and we hadn't finished our food yet. Thankfully they replaced the food and did not charge me for it.  When we were finishing up I was trying to order some sushi to go for my husband and the sushi chef gave me a hard time because he refused to tell me how many ounces of sashimi I would get if I ordered the ninja 20 pc. He wouldn't even give me a range of how many ounces I could possibly get. This is the only reason I did not give them 5 stars. I needed to get close to 10oz and honestly I don't see why they had so much issues telling me a range of how many ounces I might see for 20pcs. This is also the only reason that may deter me from coming here again. His mannerism was annoyed and somewhat rude everything else was excellent."}
{"text":"I read the review about the rude sushi chef and it reminded me of the Seinfeld TV show \"Soup Nazi\" episode where Jerry, Elaine, Kramer and George had to endure a crazy soup chef's mistreatment to get a bowl of his delicious soup... Lol. Well, no rude sushi chef when we were there today for lunch, a very friendly hostess, and delicious fresh seaweed salad, sashimi and sushi rolls.  We are from back east and if you are looking for a sushi place with bar, fresh food, good prices this would be it.  Seaweed salad - genuine legit, light tasting, ranks with the best we've had.  Sashimi sampler - 2 nicely sized slices of tuna, salmon, yellowtail. Tuna was the best - fresh, firm, red - spot on. Spicy tuna roll delicious, Dragon Roll with eel sauce very good, best roll was Spider Roll - mmmmm fresh fried crab inside roll crisp and tasty.  Waitress was very attentive, even noticing enough to ask if we had enough ginger for the extra roll we ordered (my wife doesn't like it so I always eat it all). Among the best sushi places we've tried including back east! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This sushi is amazing. I have been to several restaurants and this is some of the freshest fish I've had. The Las Vegas roll is awesome. Also, their sashimi is unreal. Service is great. No complaints. Consider me a regular."}
{"text":"My and my boyfriends favorite sushi place. Prices are excellent and the sushi and sashimi is the best I have had In Arizona. My boyfriend and I were impressed with the service, friendliness of the staff and the fact that they remembers details about us that most places just wouldn't remember. We moved far away so we don't come as often as we used to but man we are reminded how much we miss it when he eat here. Love his place!"}
{"text":"How have I not already reviewed this gem! The sushi is divine; the fish is the best I've ever had. Jen is lovely. She brings us treats and does her best to accomdate our limited diet. The fish is so fresh. The seasonings are divine. This place blows every other sushi place out of the water. The lemon soju is to die for. Salmon collar and shrimp shumai are amazing. So are the spicy green beans. And you really can't beat the chirashi. It is so unique and delicious. This is my go to place for sushi anywhere in the valley. Troy, Jen, and Mollie are the best!"}
{"text":"You definitely get what you paid for.  We ordered the Danforth boat and the Rainbow roll. It came with two miso soups and salads. We upgraded the sushi roll in the Danforth boat to Black Dragon roll and we just paid the difference of $1. All the rolls were tightly wrapped and all the sashimi were very fresh. We were glad the sushis were not mostly filled with rice."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, very fresh and great quality!  Very inexpensive with outstanding service.  
Do not let the outside appearance steer you away from this treasure.  This is one case where looks are deceiving."}
{"text":"Small space, we were greeted by the owner immediately upon entering the restaurant. It was later in the evening so there was only 1 other table. Our server was nice but the owner was great! Very hospitable and she even gave us some samples of soju! We had a few sushi rolls, Cardinals Roll, Futomaki, Scorpion Roll and White Dragon Roll. All were really good. Since we ordered the Cardinals roll which has Sriracha Sauce on it, she figured we liked spicy food, which she was correct, so she gave us an order of their Spicy Edamame, it had a blend of Korean, Japanese and a couple other chili pastes and sauces on it, it was also a little charred which gave it a great smoky flavor also. Overall everything was great."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! The sushi is the freshest and just hands down the best we have ever eaten. You can't even compare the sushi to any other place in the valley. The atmosphere, staff and sushi chefs are all amazing- and not to mention extremely reasonable prices for the quality and size rolls. Here are a few of my favorite rolls to try: tuna lover; cardinal; Alaskan roll and my all time very favorite is the lollipop!!!"}
{"text":"We come here at least once a week. Jen and her team are fantastic. Freshest sushi around. We feel like members of the family when we come here. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service could be much better. We were seated for 10 minutes before I eventually just got up and walked to the back and grabbed myself some menus. It took awhile for the waitress to come and take our order and then our rolls started coming out, everyone had eaten all of their food before my roll came out. Kind of annoying. I think they could be more attentive to the tables."}
{"text":"We love this place! Really fresh fish, extremely clean, friendly staff! We've been about a half-dozen times and had a great experience each time. Love getting their specials and trying new things each time. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, service was amazing, atmosphere was great. Many people coming in were greeted by name and with a hug. You can tell this is a regular spot with the locals. We had a dragon roll, summer roll, and Alaska roll and they were all delicious. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good family owned sushi spot."}
{"text":"I ordered salmon bowl for lunch and seriously believe the salmon taste stink. The owner tried to defend the quality but it just made the lunch stressful. 
I stopped the debate by telling him I will pay for whatever the bowl costs, and ordered chicken kazu, turned out the vegetables that comes with the chicken are half dry and turned color already. 

Sure, food quality varies, so does the reviews. 
0 points for it's bad service and food."}
{"text":"I thought I had already written a review of my favorite Sushi spot, but I was wrong.  Perhaps subliminally I was holding out and not allowing others to find this gem, I don't like to share!

The food here is everything you want in sushi - FRESH seafood to be consumed as sashimi or combined with other flavors to create delicious specialty rolls.

Everything I've tried here is excellent - from sashimi to tempura, it's all great.  The owners (Jennifer and Troy) treat us like part of the family.  They really do appreciate your business and it shows.

Treat yourself to the Hwayo Soju!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite sushi restaurants and we drive over 40 minutes to come here and eat the creativity and variety of the menu options is never-ending great environment for family fast service before you hit the movie theaters highly recommend"}
{"text":"Very simple....Jen and her sushi are the best in the area.  Love it."}
{"text":"We've just moved to Gilbert and this was our first venture out for sushi in the area. Amazing first impression. The yakisoba is fantastic and the three rolls were equally fabulous. Even the water is crisp and clean."}
{"text":"Great local spot with tons of options! Love how fresh the sushi is and a very friendly staff. 

We had nigiri, yellowtail love roll, lollipop roll, dynamite roll and the pork gyoza. All so delicious. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Really great sushi place. My dad comes every day for lunch because he works down the street, but whenever I come on weekends it's a great experience. Everyone is so nice, and it has a family feel to it. Really interesting music selection, one minute it will be Young Thug, then it will be Justin Bieber, then Hawaiian music. Other than that, the bento boxes are fantastic and the suchi is great."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch on a Friday and it was pretty dead inside. We ordered 3 rolls (California, Philly, and Las Vegas) and calamari as an appetizer. 

The calamari meat was good, but the tempura coating was soggy, greasy, and flavorless. The dipping sauce they brought out was also a little on the flavorless side too. My husband and I always order calamari at restaurants, and this one was one of the worst we've had.

The California roll and the Philly roll were really good. The fish in the Philly roll was fresh and the rice was delicious. They are the reason for the 3 stars. The Las Vegas roll was tempura coated and it was soggy and greasy like the calamari was. I wished we had skipped the the calamari and the Las Vegas roll and just gotten 2 more of the basic rolls.

I will probably come back here, but I will stick to the basic rolls and wont try any of the more elaborate rolls. I'll keep this place in mind for a quick solo lunch or take out."}
{"text":"Small a la cart sushi tucked away on the danforth. Nice atmosphere and the sushi was excellent. Meat to rice ratio spot on and service was good. A bit on there pricy side but is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I'm always a little leary about trying sushi without any previous knowledge of the place. This was very good. The place was busy but we were seated and the server was very attentive and answered all our questions. If there's a dowside it's not the food it was the level of noice. But I could just be overly sensitive to the noice level.  We didn't have to wait too long for our food or drinks. Well done Yaganaki...we'll be back."}
{"text":"This is the best place in AZ in my opinion off the places I've been.. I hope I can help direct the future here. This is a small place very friendly the owner stands for her yelp comment and the food is real. Please come and try for yourself awesome... soooooo good."}
{"text":"If you like sushi you will absolutely love this place!!!!  I come here every week and the sushi is amazing!!!  I always get the seared ahi tuna and its always amazing!!! The service is always on point and sushi is very consistent and FRESH.  If you love sushi you have to come here. The prices are always fair and food is great!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were looking for a sushi place for lunch, and we decided to stop by here. When you walk in the atmosphere is very relaxing and we were greeted by the owner Jen. We had the Avocado Salmon roll which was super delicious. We also got the salmon and himachi sashimi, the unagi nigiri, the ahi tuna poke salad, monkfish liver (Ankimo), abalone, and the butter scallops. All which were sooo good! The sashimi is super fresh and big slices! The poke was really good as well, it's mixed with fresh white and green onion and sesame oil. The monkfish liver was delicious, as well as the abalone! We also received some shrimp dumplings on the house, which was really nice of them! What really made this place stand out was the hospitality. Jen was really nice and talked to us for a while. You can definitely tell how much effort she puts into making customers feel comfortable. They seem to always look for something new to add and for customers to try. Jen also told us about how she's picky about the quality of the seafood that comes in, which shows how much she cares about customer experience especially when it comes to specialty dishes. Overall, very wonderful experience and definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I Strongly recommend this restaurant..!! 
Especially, Danforth boat is amazing.
Great food with a really good customer service. 
It's probably the best Restaurant around this area."}
{"text":"Sushi was excellent. Had a spicy tuna role and it's was just about perfect along with the garlic Albacore role. Would definitely suggest to anyone"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now. I like to try to eat and patronize local small business owners. This was a great place. We have been loyal to our sushi chef for the last 15 years, but now this place is an option for something a little different. Great happy hour prices til 6pm"}
{"text":"Very fresh sushi, but always understaffed and slow. Rolls take 1 hour to make. Even calling ahead for pick won't be punctual, I'm now waiting another 30min on top of when I called in 30mins ago."}
{"text":"Soooo good!! The white dragon roll is a must try. The sashimi is fresh, the service was phenomenal and the whole family left satisfied! Above and beyond 5 stars!! Might be my new fave sushi place!!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi place! Great happy hour prices, good food, portions are good size, staff is friendly and attentive. The owner is hilarious!"}
{"text":"Such a great find, super friendly owner and staff and fantastic sushi.  We have been back over and over since finding this gem and never left disappointed.  Very fresh sushi and some unique combinations.  Tempura is also great here, lightly breaded with great taste.  

Highly recommended for a fresh, tasty and friendly experience!"}
{"text":"Used to go to this place all the time when I was younger for the Katsu/Sushi Combo #3. It's so great to see that their food quality, service, and prices are all still excellent -- if not even better. They have some of the best Katsu and it comes at a very affordable price ($7-$10 depending on if you get a combo or not) and their service just makes it that much more welcoming.

A must-have if you go to FMP."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our food here. Sushi was very fresh and well prepared. Uni available and really good. The sun rise roll excellent. Lemon slices in the roll was an different addition that will become a favorite I'm sure m. Our kids also likes the bento boxes and \"marble\" soda drinks."}
{"text":"After eating here twice, I remain underwhelmed. Sushi is average but with a premium price. Chirashi sushi was a decent value with quality rice that makes or breaks the dish.  I was hopeful that the east valley would finally get a premium sushi restaurant. I'll keep searching."}
{"text":"I love eating sushi here. The owner Jennifer is truly amazing & a delight to talk to and the sushi chef, Troy knows how to make his sushi. Very fresh fish, I love there happy hour pricing!"}
{"text":"We did takeout. It's not a place for cheap sushi, but you are clearly paying for quality, care and skill. Green Dragon rolls - the avocado was so creamy and so filling. The sheer mass of such a pricy ingredient was impressive! No skimpy bits of underripe avocado here! Everything was exquisitely sliced, arranged, presented, even for takeout! Usually I laugh at people who take photos of their meal, but it felt almost wrong to bite into these creations! This is likely why others claim service is 'slow' - they're not making mall or fast food here, they're taking time FOR YOU cos you're worth it! If you need fast & cheap (who doesn't sometimes) there are more appropriate places."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my husband and it's a fantastic addition to the area (the old place wasn't bad too).  I had their bento with beef teriyaki and sashimi which was one of their lunch specials and it was really great!  The sashimi was a good thickness (not too thin, but just thin enough to enjoy), and the beef teriyaki was cooked medium and was a steak vs. the really thinly sliced meat that other places had.  Service was great, though it was fairly empty that day.

One thing that would help a bit with the place is the signage and the frontage.  We walked by there while LOOKING for it because it looked so dark and there was no signage for people walking by.  Either a sandwich board or some signage at eye level would probably help!

I took off a star due to price point, but I would definitely return since I live in the area.  There are better priced places north of here but if you're in the area, definitely a nice regular place to go for quality food."}
{"text":"Walking in for lunch, the place was empty.  Through the lunch, another pair of customers and a single walked in.

Server was a bit forceful but friendly enough.  Sushi Man looked tired.

The prices were on par, if not a tad cheaper that other comparable restaurants.

The qualify of the fish was weak and the preparation by Sushi Man lacked any semblance of skill.

Wondering how this place received such a high rating.


Came because of the positive reviews but will not be back."}
{"text":"First time trying sushi and it was really good.
It is a little pricey, paid almost $30 for a roll, four pieces of sushi and a drink but nonetheless the quality was there"}
{"text":"I'm honestly not sure how this place can afford to be in business with such cheap and filling meals. $5.75 + HST for a pork katsu meal that includes salad, rice and soup/pop? It's been at least 8 years since I first eyed my friend's takeout box at school and decided I needed to get one for myself next time I went.... and I've been going ever since.

It's not going to be the best katsu (I find the katsu hard). They don't make the best rolls. But they do provide some of the best service, the same Korean lady has been running it for as long as I've known and all the sauces are provided up front in case you wanted extra tonkatsu sauce.

I think all prices are carefully selected to round to a convenient number after tax (eg. $6.50 in the case of the pork katsu).

Cash and debit only."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great service!  The salmon sashimi is so good. Great for date night or family night."}
{"text":"Great food! I love my sushi and this had exactly what I needed. They took care of us and made sure we were well fed! I will totally come here again. Fresh & great!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy I got GREAT sushi in my tummy!!! This place is fantastic!! I mean worth more than a 5 star!!! The staff is very friendly, the place itself is small but put together very well, very clean and has a relaxed atmosphere. Their menu is pretty large, all kinds of different rolls to chose from, sashimi, salads,  soups, kids platters..... something for everyone. They have a really good happy hour, different hot and cold saki, saki bombs, beer and wine. I was really glad I found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a shot! The sushi was so fresh and tasty, no problems at all, like heaven in my mouth! It was really nice to go to a place that has 5 star food and 5 star service! Now I know why almost every review is 5 stars, they are truly a 5 star place! Cant wait to go back when I get another sushi craving, think this is going to be my new sushi spot!!"}
{"text":"Really beautiful atmosphere, food and service. I'd highly recommend this place for anyone looking for good sushi in this part of town."}
{"text":"The staff was great. The food was not. We didn't eat most of the rolls we ordered. The fish wasn't fresh tasting. We went here one time before and thought we'd give it a second try. We won't make the same mistake."}
{"text":"Don't let the strip mall location fool you. Fresh, delicious fish at fair prices. Sashimi was beautifully done and presentation was on point. What really made the experience was the service. We brought in a brood of rowdy children, and the restaurant staff was not only patient and warm but made the experience fun for our family. Highly recommend. We will be back."}
{"text":"Came here to try their lunch special menu. The chicken/pork katsu is not bad for just $5.75. Portions are pretty decent as well. I also ordered their sushi lunch special (16pcs) of sushi for $7.52, however I thought was pretty pricey considering the california roll wasn't too tasty (tasted kind of bland) and the salmon/ cucumber sushi was nothing special. The owners were very nice though."}
{"text":"Well deserved 5 stars! Free miso soup and salad to start is always a good start. The service was the best and Jen the owner was so nice and funny, she makes you feel like family. Now about the food. We ordered sushi, sashimi, terriyaki chicken, baked mussels, and rolls... The Albacore sushi was one of the best I've had, we had to order it 3 more times! The albacore garlic roll (i think that was the name) was our fave! We ordered another one! If you like philly rolls look no further... They are perfect and they put avocado in them :) We will be making this a frequent stop."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for sushi. Jennifer the owner is awesome and the sushi is freshest in AZ!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant, we followed the Yelp reviews and they were spot on. Jennifer came out and made us feel welcome, and after our great meal we all got a hug from her. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a good dinner. What was lacking from the walls was made up for with the food. As far as service we got attention from the owner and the different servers made sure we had refills and everything else we could want. Great food and sweet owner equals a five star combo in my book. Be back soon"}
{"text":"Great food!  We had some specialty rolls, some classic rolls and some sashimi.  All was fresh and tasty with nice presentation.  We took out but the dining room was clean and they staff very friendly.  We finally found a great sushi restaurant in the Coxwell / Danforth area!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced small sushi and short staffed causing long wait. Food wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"Freshest Sushi in Toronto!! We tried their Sushi boat and some rolls and the place was phenomenal. The reviews were great, and the pictures looked good, so we stumbled into the place. Staff was friendly and always attentive and decor was great too. Really good atmosphere. I must emphasize... The best thing about this place is their food, and I truly think this is the best Sushi restaurant in Toronto. A try is a must!!!!"}
{"text":"It was okay. I ordered two items from the happy hour menu and was charged one dollar extra than it was stated on the menu. Nobody came to me to ask whether I was satisfied with the taste of my meal.

The rolls I ordered were smaller than in other sushi places, but maybe because they're from the happy hour menu. They were okay, nothing too memorable.

There was a toddler with her father at the other table. The toddler was loud and obnoxious. The owners tried to bribe her with candy and force-feed her. I don't know what is the relationship between the owners and the child but it was quite peculiar. I didn't want to pay attention to that but the sound is setup so that you can hear every conversation there."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in Gilbert.  The owner Jennifer is fantastic.  Troy is an outstanding chef and don't be afraid to have some fun in this place.  Very hospitable and I have a group that goes at least once a week."}
{"text":"The food is amazing but the staff is even better! We have become regulars here and come once or twice a week. The food is quality and the price is low. Jen, the owner makes you feel like family from day one. I bring everyone here and would recommend it to any and everyone. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time on the recommendations of Yelp and loved it not only were the people great but the food was amazing.."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience. Incredibly friendly staff and owner.  We'll definitely be back.  Crowded on a Friday night. Which means they are doing something  RIGHT! highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch! Great specials going on all the time. Their spicy edamame is some of the best edamame we've ever had. So much flavor in every bite! Their kids meals are great also! All the food is very fresh and good quality. The poke bowls are my usual go to. Service is also very good."}
{"text":"Incredibly fresh sushi!! Soooo incredibly fresh! The staff is very attentive as well.

What we got:
1. Alaskan roll 5/5
2. Vegas roll 5/5
3. Alabacore garlic roll 5/5
4. Edamame 5/5
5. Kirin and large sake 5/5

The total was around $54. The Vegas roll and Alaskan roll came right out the oven so be careful it might be a little hot. The Alabacore garlic roll was my absolute favorite because I tasted nothing but freshness! 

Definitely one of the best sushi places in the chandler and Gilbert area. They have a dope music playlist too!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi for the Phoenix area.  Not a huge selection of fish, but the fish they did have was very nice.

- The saba was mildly fishy.  Smoother than normal
- The shiro mutsu wasn't as rich and buttery as I'm used to, but it was still very nice
- The maguro was excellent.  Firm and rich
- The hamachi had a nice buttery aftertaste
- The uni was smooth and sweet, but not as creamy as usual, especially for Santa Barbara sushi
- The lollipop roll was nice and fresh and still had enough fish to make it worthwhile

- The attentive and personal service was appreciated"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. Food is great, atmosphere is nice, and the owner Jennifer is amazing. I had only been in one other time and she remebered my family and that my daugter plays soccer. he asked how is soccer going. Nice to find a resturat that not a chain and has a personal touch to it. Thanks Jennifer."}
{"text":"This business gets 5 stars hands down because of the friendly service they provide! And the bonus is that the sushi is great and cheap happy hour prices! I will be back! :)"}
{"text":"For Gilbert standards, this is a really good sushi spot. We went on a Saturday for lunch but they told us they were only accepting orders from the dinner menu, so it was a bit pricier than we had hoped, but tasty nonetheless. Everything tasted fresh and some of the sushi roll options were pretty creative, but we tend to stick towards the more simplistic rolls.  I wish we went during happy hour because their happy hour menu had some great deals (REALLY cheap beer too). We will return!"}
{"text":"I have found the oasis in the desert, the diamond in the rough of sushi restaurants to slay my behemoth cravings for fresh raw fish. Ask the mananger Jen about where she gets her fish. She actually knows! She cares about how fresh her fish is. She practically brags about it. Can't say I blame her. 

She made me Sochu with fresh squezed lemons and brought out her spicy almost Sichuan style green beans. Mouth watering, rich and smoky from all the garlic. Puts other \"angry\" versions to shame!

Troy the chef makes some of the best cuts. I've had from a range of perfectly sliced raw scallops, in season raw sea bass. His tako is some of the best I've had (top three in America) you tell him to surprise you and he will. I have pics to prove it. 

If you want traditional just the salad, soup, and matcha tea will set your taste buds to Japan. I still wish the salad had more color but the miso glaze is delicious. The miso soup is amazing, perfect balance of salt and dashi (seaweed) and bonito (fish flakes). Not to mention the green tea is Japanese ceremonial grade matcha. They serve it over ice or hot. 

Also of note, try the shumai. It's a shrimp dumpling with dipping sauce. The wrapping is just the right amount of chewy and the shrimp are so plump it melts in your mouth. 

Well I hope they work out the nuances of starting a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow just wow! The food was phenomenal and the service was even better. The owner and our server made us feel like we were family. Everything was very fresh and very tasty. This is my new go to sushi place."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how long this restaurant has been open but someone who passed by outside told me it was pretty new still. 

Inside the restaurant, its pretty casual, nothing fancy.  It feels like a mom-and-pop type of place.  The middled-aged lady who greeted us at the door may be the owner/manager as well.  She was very friendly but she was the ONLY hostess/server when we were there.  We came at a weird time ~4-5pm.  There were 2 sushi chefs.  The place seemed a little under-staffed.  Normally I wouldn't care much as long as the service was fine, however, because she was the only person working the floor.  She incapable of being attentive to u,  as well as, the other tables which is the reason this place is getting 4 STARS, instead of 5.

Our meal came with a simple lettuce salad with a ginger dressing that was delicious AND a small miso soup (each person receives this, if you want).  I got the vegetable maki and salmon lover's roll which were both tasty.  The salmon and tuna lovers roll was visually appealing since it had cute little miso/sriracha dressing along the rim of the sushi plate.  
They didn't give a lot of ginger even though I had asked for extra.  She assured me that the other plates coming would have more and actually the salmon lovers roll does NOT come with any wasabi or ginger on the plate.  Since it was she was busy, I didn't even have a chance to ask again or to ask for a refill on the water.  

I would have rated this place a 3.5 based on the experience (lacking help since there was not other people on the floor).  If there was more serves, I probably would have given this place a 4.5."}
{"text":"Awesome staff!! Great happy hour prices and good sushi. The spicy green beans have such good flavor if you like heat."}
{"text":"Service was very slow so don't eat here if you are super hungry or in a rush. It was bad service just slow. But the sushi was some of the best sushi I have it had. It was really good so I couldn't be too mad about the wait."}
{"text":"The sushi is great and a very fair price, especially if you come for happy hour. The  thing that keeps us coming back though, is the service. The ladies that work here are so friendly, accommodating, and kind to us and especially our one year old son. A lot of restaurants are not very understanding of having children, but they go above and beyond here to make sure you have an enjoyable dining experience!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely overrated! Just dine there tonight after seeing great reviews on Yelp. The fish they served was just ok and nothing special or very fresh. Price was little high for the quality of food they served. My biggest complaint? The sushi chef who was not friendly and unresponsive. Not once he smiled. Only reason I gave 2 stars was because of the nice waitress who served us."}
{"text":"At first we got there and it wasn't very busy but I tell ya what some of the best spicy tuna rolls I ever had! Would definitely go again. The waiter then waitress were great also!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. The food was fantastic and the owner treated our large party so well. We had four active and not-so-quiet children in our party. The owner provided the kids with complimentary desserts and an Asian jello treat. The sashimi quality was excellent and the lollipop rolls were delicious. Ten stars for service! Thank you! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with wife and kid.  When I checked-in on Yelp app, it gave me a free spicy edamame.  

They were busy so it took a while for food to come.  Sushi was good."}
{"text":"wow....... just wow!!!! i moved here 5years ago and and had a hard time finding a place.... this is a  gemmmmmm. wow woooooooww i cant even!!!!!!!! there are no words!!!!!! wwwwwwwtttttttttfffffffff!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yanagi Sushi is the only place we will go in the East Valley. The sushi is always fresh and outstanding in flavor. It's beautiful to the eyes and has amazing flavor. Our favorites are the tuna tacos, Alaskan and Las Vegas Rolls. The Shashimi is fantastic too! 
Jennifer makes sure the service is spot on. Hope you enjoy it as much as we do."}
{"text":"Sushi was very fishy & I specifically asked for Wasabi and Ginger and they said it was in the bag . I waited for 30 minutes for the sushi and drove 30 minutes home , very long day at work... still had to put the kids down to find out,  neither was in the to go  order!  I would like a refund for $65 worth of sushi!"}
{"text":"Top quality sushi.  So excited to finally have a new good restaurant in the area.  More spicy tuna specialty rolls would be great to add to the menu, but everything we ordered was really good."}
{"text":"best sushi in the east valley!  holy moly - this place is legit!"}
{"text":"The current rating is far too high. The rolls were bland and the cuts were pretty small. I will not visit again."}
{"text":"It' always an enjoyable experience every time my husband and I come here. The owners are friendly and they know their customers well. I've tried different food here and everything i have eaten taste good, consistent and good quality. We simply love Yanagi!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner during Happy Hour. Got 4 rolls, Miso soup, green tea. They hot green tea is good. Miso was also good. The 4 rolls came out timely and was very fresh. The environment is cozy, nicely lit, sport center was on the TV. Great place for dinner or a casual date."}
{"text":"I decided to do some  Yelp checking in details since we have been on the look out for  a new Sushi hang out since moving from Florida, I researched, and came up with this place. the talk of \"Jen\" being helpful and friendly was part of the appeal I looked up their menu, it looks good. and it was open at 3:30 pm when I pick up my 11 year old from school (who loves sushi more than me) the best part is It is only about 2 miles south of her school. We zoomed off, found it with ease. I liked the atmosphere even though it's in a strip mall, it didn't seem like it. as we came in there was this huge sign I believe It says (Do NOT SIT YOURSELF) I didn't think too much of it, maybe because this harsh and abrasive little woman approached us in an empty restaurant. and insisted on  telling me my 11 year old 4'11 inch well behaved child could not sit at the sushi bar, because a 13 year old had fallen off the chair there.. cough cough. I smiled and said \"Are you Jen?\" Yeah she replied\" I said well we researched you on yelp, and we are searching for a new regular sushi bar, and your menu also had some Korean  deleacacies that appeal to me. She said nothing, and grunted and sat us at the sushi bar, where she seemed upset about us ordering water not soda or beer... which we never drink. I asked a few questions with a smile and she answered by speaking over me and makng me feel tense. I stopped that immediately convinced that I was misreading her. then I spoke to the sushi chef, I was old \"Don't talk to me\" order through her as he pointed to Jen... she would not approach us, so I  am able to project my voice across a theatre without yelling, I figured in an empty restaurant, I could do it about 30 feet, she ansered,  said that sounds good. about two expensive items, the sashimi special and the Aji, which is my favorite  abou4 47 bucks if my math is right. she refused to approach us while finally we managed to get an orer for my daughter, apologetically I said I know I am not suppose to speak to you but could you cut the pieces a little smaller than usual for my daughter,  I also  began to sing Merry Christmas in Hawaian because they said they were originally  from there, because I asked, they grunted a yes, as I sang I didn't win them over, still being ignored, my daughter sat in front of her sushi roll not eating it, as my phone rang (insurance agent) bad timeing but I had to take the call. I took a bite wondering why she didn't eat it, it was not fresh, we left. and found a magnificent sushi sashimi seafood buffett in Gilbert. Wow it was awesome. sadly I always bring my own ponzu to the sushi chef but left it behind, so I didn't have it at the good dinner we had. Jen needs to seek help. and all the people that mention how awesome she is, I am convinced have to be personal friends doing yelp reviews. they are an embarssment to the sushi industry , and a bigger embarrament to humanity. If I could post zero stars you bet I would."}
{"text":"Love this place, it was our second time dining there and we will certainly return.  The prices are reasonable, the selection is very good for a local sushi spot, and the customer service is excellent.  The owner is always around and she was amazing with our kids, she even offered them some cheez balls while we were waiting for our food.  Don't pass up the Chirashi bowl, it's got everything that you want/need in one item and it is delicious."}
{"text":"Tried this sushi restaurant for the first time always trying a new restaurant, and for sure this is our new spot!! We were greeted immediately by all the staff . So We sat at the bar ,GREAT service by the CHEIF and loved our waitress, she was fun and it was a pleasure!  The food and prices are GREAT!! The restaurant is clean, small and quaint, very comfortable!!! Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"We were on our way to Rubio's the other day and noticed this new sushi spot had opened up. Went back last night to give this place a shot. The owner, Jennifer, is super friendly and went out of her way to give us AMAZING service. The food itself was decent, but I will say their sashimi was VERY fresh! If you like yellow and japanese scallop - CHECK THIS PLACE OUT. Both items were very fresh and so naturally sweet and buttery!!!! Probably the best I've had in the east valley in AZ and I grew up here! Our veggie yaki udon came out a bit salty but we didn't say anything. As Jennifer was walking around checking in with all the guests, she came past our table, took one look at the udon and asked \"if the udon too salty\"? We said no at first because we felt bad but then told her yes it was. She didn't hesitate, took the dish back, and brought us out a new one! WOW - now that's service! Not only did she do that, but she ended up comping the dish when the bill came. You don't get this type of service at many establishments nowadays. If your on this side of town, make sure you check this place out! It's in the same plaza as Rubio's and Starbucks."}
{"text":"The freshness and quality of this place is the best I've had in the valley in a long time. The fresh salmon is so silky and buttery that you chewing could be optional. The owner is friendly and servicing the tables herself... And she's a patriots fan!!! Major bonus. We ended up getting 20% off our bill because the cardinals and pats won their last games. The dining room is not too big so it makes for a cozy and intimate experience. This place has only been open about 10 weeks so it wasn't too busy, and we came on a Tuesday. Very high recommendation for this one."}
{"text":"Big Portio, I couldn't finish my dinner.
The katsu is just okay... the oil they use for deep fried wasn't fresh oil. 
However, Good price for the food."}
{"text":"Sushi was good so I would taste five stars. But I am dropping my rating because service needs improvement. I went in today with my dad for lunch for the first time having high expectations. I was impressed they were open for lunch on Sunday's since not many sushi places are. And the reviews raved about great customer service and friendly staff and a bubbly happy owner. Well I didn't see any of that. 
We ordered spicy scallops (fresh and tasty) cucumber salad, which was literally just sliced cucumbers but for $5 it was good, squid salad, and 40 piece sashimi (all very fresh and tasty).  
We chose to sit at a table because the sushi chef seemed quiet. It's fun when the chef has a good time. Creates a good atmosphere. Our waitress had no personality. All the four seat tables were dirty and needed a quick wipe down. For only an hour into their day, seemed like it must have been dirty from the night before. Sushi chef looked like he would have rather been at home watching football. Especially considering he paid more attention to the tv behind him than to making food so it took quite awhile for the food to come out. 
Food came with miso soup and salad. Ginger dressing on the salad was really good seemed fresh not bottled. And the miso was some of the best I've had. Just wish we got more than 1/4th of a bowl to enjoy. 
So overall. I would give them a A on the food. But C on service. I just didn't get even half the great experience others have raved about."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great happy hour specials, and fish is always fresh! The love rolls are some of my favorites, although the yellow tail live roll I had was not on my list of favorites. Tuna and salmon were delicious. The garlic albacore roll will have you licking your lips. Been here 7 times now and they have been very consistent."}
{"text":"Service was great, they're very polite and welcoming. The sushi tasted good, not sure if it was fresh though. It got all my friends and me sick. Maybe we went on a bad day or maybe they're not handling their fish properly. Stomach pains started shortly after leaving the place. The cook should always be extra careful! This is raw fish you're handling, people can get food poisoning if you're neglectful and that's exactly what happened. I had heard so many great things about this place, I am disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow!  I was impressed!  Jennifer is a most gracious owner and host.  She and her husband have won me over for sushi.  We went there on a Thursday night, and got there just after happy hour.  

Food was excellent!  Service was amazing.  Jennifer had us try her spicy green beans.  They were very spicy and delicious.  She also had us try the Smoky Salmon.  It was incredible.  I believe that it will be a special in the future.

I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My wife and i live nearby and had been waiting for a legit sushi restaurant to open in our neighbourhood.
Most sushi places that are not true sushi bars are good for some rolls and tempura. This is NOT the case with Yanagi. Excellent sushi/sashimi but we are also a big fan of the maki.
The layer of rice on the maki is not too thick so there is a good ratio of roll filling to the rice.
Hamachi is delicious. Try the lobster and spicy salmon roll. 
Thank you Yanagi for coming to the area I hope they get the patronage that they deserve."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good sushi spot in the neighborhood so was excited when I heard about this place. 

Hands down best sushi in this part of town.  Fish was fresh, nice presentation, and great variety of menu options.   We had the small sashimi platter, sushi platter with aburi, spicy scallop roll, negi toro roll, salmon teriyaki, grilled salmon collar, and chicken oyako don.  Everything was very good.  The only thing we didn't like was the oyako don...it had broth -which was odd.

Place is family friendly...we had two toddlers with us and they gave them complimentary amuse bouche somen noodles (they loved them!).  Good metered street parking outside the restaurant.  Will now be my go to neighborhood sushi spot."}
{"text":"I am so happy we found YANAGI Sushi! 

The service is great and the food comes out quick! The sashimi is so good that my fiancé and I had to go the next day and get it again! 

The owner Jen is a sweetheart and really wants you to feel comfortable. 

If you want sushi don't waste your time looking anywhere else or trying something different...get the good stuff and come here!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this restaurant based on the great reviews. I'm vegetarian, so I don't eat fish and sometimes it is a challenge to find things to eat in sushi restaurants. I feel like I had enough options here. My husband loves fish and thought everything was very high quality and the sushi pieces were on the generous side. The service was slow, but they had several tables sit down around the same time. They also had a help wanted sign on the door, so hopefully that will improve."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to describe how much I love this place! The food is amazing, the interior is like a cute home environment, the staff is incredibly friendly, and the owners (Jen and Troy) are so sweet! I love how the entire staff greets you with a friendly and welcoming \"Hello!\" as you walk in. Great place to eat and just hang out for a while. Escape the heat this summer with yanagi sushi!"}
{"text":"We went in based on all of the reviews from yelp... 4.5 star rating is want I expected. I don't usually judge an establishment on the location in a strip mall since there are a lot of them around.
We went in at 430, happy hour. Nothing special but decent drink specials. We ordered 2 hh apps, pork yogza, and stuffed jalapeños. The dumplings were deep fried and tasted like grease, no flavor whatsoever! The jalapeños were also deep fried and had a dog food like stuffing. They were spicy hot but also not very good flavored. We had the Cardinal roll which I thought was good but had too many flavors of sauces mixed on the plate. And the twin tower roll. Which is deep fried. I disliked it so much I was taking the deep fry off and trying to eat the rice and shrimp. Awful flavors mixing in the food and I miss my old go to sushi bar!!

Overall , I should have picked all of the food. But with the help of my spouse, we ended up with poor choices covered in deep fry and sitting on the toilet all night. I will never go back and hope you never try it."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in Gilbert. My wife and I probably come here twice per month and they never disappoint. Excellent happy hour and reasonable prices, but the quality of the sushi is what really sets them apart."}
{"text":"This sushi place is in a Chinese strip mall. The quality is sub par and the staff was not very nice. We asked for extra plastic forks and chopsticks because we were sharing the food at the mall but the owners asked lots of questions about why we need that many chopsticks e.t.c. How else are we eating your sushi if we don't have them? *rolls eyes*"}
{"text":"This is probably the friendliest place in Gilbert. The food is fresh, fantastic atmosphere, and very clean. My entire family really likes this place. There's really good food for the kids too! I've asked for a few special things or modifications and they've made it no problem."}
{"text":"Amazing Service! 
Delicious Sushi!
Great Happy Hour Specials!
This new restaurant lives up to the reviews. Super fresh food,  lovely servers."}
{"text":"I went there with my son and his girlfriend tonight for dinner. The girlfriend and I each ordered spicy tuna rolls. Only one came, and when she tasted it, it was grossly over spicy, mixed with too much spicy pepper. I tasted one and I agreed. When we told the waitress that it was terrible, she said she would have the owner taste it. The owner came over and said it was made spicy like that because her patrons complained it wasn't spicy enough. She then told us she would take one of the spicy tuna rolls off the bill, but since we ate the entire other one, she would charge us for it..Huh? We never received the other one!!! She didn't apologize or ask us if we wanted something else. Next, my shrimp tempura roll was just ok, not great, not bad. Sons girlfriend had a dynamite roll, and it was blech! Had some crunchy pieces in it. My sons white dragon came about 20 min later, we thought they forgot about it because it came so much later than the other rolls. All in all, not a good experience. Although, the waiter kid was a nice guy.
Would definitely not go there again"}
{"text":"Bad service. Bad attitude. From the moment you walk in you are made to feel as an intruder. No follow up between ordering or after getting your meal. Frankly it was just plain rude service"}
{"text":"My husband and I love to come here for their lunch bento boxes.  So many choices!  A nice large portion so you don't leave hungry but not over full either.  Both sushi and non-sushi options.  Very good!"}
{"text":"Great place. Definitely talk to Jennifer about the menu, she has amazing suggestions. I will be back."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the food despite the rave reviews we saw on Yelp. The miso soup was watered down and tasted like instant. The tuna sashimi tasted fishy and color was brownish. When I pointed this out, the owner replaced it promptly with fresh looking (bright red) tuna sashimi. However, she argued the first cut was indeed fresh also. First rule of sushi: it should be fresh in taste AND appearance. If it's not, don't serve it. We really wanted to like this place but we will not be returning. There was one item I liked so I gave 2 stars."}
{"text":"The sushi was so fresh, it swam to the table.

Okay, maybe not, but I did enjoy me some good fish!  Sushi should never be fishy.  Fishy fish is scary and gross but the sweet taste of the sea is always good.  So I waited to come here twice before writing my review.  The first visit happened on good old Boxing Day, December 26th, 2015.  After a long day of retail therapy, we settled in for a nice meal of dead fish.  Their menu is overwhelming, informative, and full of all sorts of goodies you could possibly want --- from Happy Hour to dinner bentos, they have whatever tickles your fancy.  We shared a Samurai Plate (20pc sashimi plate + 6pc nigiri] for $34.95, their specialty Lollipop Roll for $11.95, a Dragon Roll for $10.95, and 2pc. uni for $11.95.  

The sashimi for our Samurai plate was cut even and tasted fresh.  The white tuna and salmon were our favorite bites from our sashimi plate and the 6pc nigiri was a nice accompaniment.  The albacore nigiri made me almost want to order more but we had other dishes coming.  So you can't go to Yanagi and not get the Lollipop Roll.  It's your basic cucumber roll with fish and imitation crab meat, sans the rice.  You won't miss not having rice because it tastes fresh.  The Dragon Roll isn't anything fancy and was ordered more as an afterthought.  I wish we ordered a different specialty roll but we just wanted some good old unagi.  Gotta love the eel with some tempura shrimp for some nice crunchy texture.  As for the uni, it was fresh and creamy.  It tasted of the sea and if kissing a mermaid was possible, that's probably what this uni tasted like.

Our second visit, just last night, held much a much similar experience as far as food goes.  It was fresh, fish was buttery, and I was happy with my meal.  Even when my eyes were welling up with tears from wasabi or something in the Hawaiian Volcano Roll, I was content.  I liked it.  So why the three stars?

This place is more on the 4-stars mark because of their friendly staff and service but I got to dock a star.  It's a quaint cozy restaurant with lots to offer and the food is decent but I'm docking a star because of a miscommunication on their part.  Twice.  On both visits:

- First visit:  I tried to pay half of the meal with my newly obtained Christmas giftcard and the other part on my debit. The $40 giftcard is new so I'm guessing the card withheld 20% of the funds or whatnot because it only ran $33-something instead of $37-something. Yanagi tried to split the bill between the two and ran my debit first and the giftcard only ran for partial amount. The difference was like $4.29. It wasn't a big deal and I said I'll pay the difference in cash so they won't have to run my debit card again  [I honestly was trying to be considerate and not have them be charged again to run my card for a measly $4-something]. Upon checking my bank statement three days later, I noticed they had charged the $4.29 on my card anyways. It's not a big deal but we're talking a +5% increase on their tip which I could be all for but I wish they told me. This could have just been a miscommunication but ehh. I was just trying to make their life easier by paying the partial in cash so they don't get charged again for running my card. I even told the waitress I'll be paying that part in cash and we showed her the $5 that covered missing funds from the giftcard BEFORE we left. I ain't gonna make a stink over $4 but very lame, Yanagi!

- Second visit:  Only one person paid for the whole bill and the birthday girl had RSVP'd on the Yelp app.  Once again, there was drama about their card.  I'm starting to think it has something to do with their machine.  I won't go into details since I'm not entirely sure what was going on with the card and/or card reader but after we paid and were leaving, I was pulled aside by the boss-lady.  She decided to lecture me how they don't take reservations on Fridays and Saturdays and I stood there awkwardly because I wasn't even the one that rsvp'd.  Had I known that it was done through the Yelp app, I would have told her that.  So I stood there being lectured when by all means she had a full restaurant to tend to and I wasn't sure if I was suppose to apologize.  Our reservation was at 6pm when it was slow. We would have been seated with no problem anyways. We all ordered food, even multiple items, so they made a solid dime off of us so I don't know why I was being lectured. I walked away confused.

So yes, come here for excellent food but I advise you to pay in cash to avoid any drama with their card machine.  Also, no reservations Fridays & Saturdays or you'll get yelled it.  Boom."}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing and the husband and wife (I believe) owners were even better! We just moved to town and have already found our new sushi spot, can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best sushi restaurants I've ever been to.  The staff is so friendly and helpful.  The food was awesome!"}
{"text":"The Hawaiian was amazing.  We enjoyed the rainbow, Alaskan, dynamite, and yanagi were so good. I would recommend trying it out for sushi fans. The white dragon was ok for my husband I wasn't a fan."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite sushi spot in all of Phoenix. The fish is so fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I thought all of these 5 star reviews for this brand new restaurant were fake because it just didn't seem real, so I decided to check it out myself with my brother during lunch time. The restaurant was very clean, the owners and server were very nice. The sushi was super fresh and you can really see and taste the difference in the fish. The owner, Jennifer, was very personable and I felt like family after talking to her for 10 minutes and even got a hug goodbye! It's hard to find business owners you can connect with like that. She has a passion for this business and takes pride in the freshness she offers at the restaurant. The prices are very reasonable and the food came out very quick. I'm excited to have this awesome sushi restaurant move into the neighborhood!! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Hawaiian family owned and run. Great services and really good food. Tasted like home, something that's hard to come by in AZ. I liked the Garlic and albacore roll. Hubby loved the smoked salmon sashimi. Kids meals are great"}
{"text":"First time in from out of town - stumbled upon this place via Yelp and the reviews are spot on. Ordered the Tuna Lover, Vegas, and the Alaskan rolls. Not usually able to eat all that we order but it was just that good. Extremely friendly and attentive staff, they make you feel like a regular instantly! My boyfriend and I both agreed this was the best sushi we've had!"}
{"text":"My go-to sushi place! They know me by name and the staff is amazing!  The quality is great, and perfect for take out or sit down."}
{"text":"I can't be any happier to show up and found out that Jennifer is the owner of this restaurant. I've met her few years back at a different sushi restaurant and she made you feel so welcome no matter where she was. I am honored to be eating at her restaurant this time. 

We ordered total of 3 rolls: caterpillar rolls, spicy tuna rolls and Hawaiian volcano. They are all equally delicious. I ordered ice green tea for drinks and it is refillable. Service is outstanding. I haven't seen my girlfriend for over 6 months and they basically left us alone to catch up for nearly 2 hours. Not even once Jennifer made us feel rushing out the door and I enjoy every minute of it. 

Before we left, I saw some delicious sashimi combo that someone else's ordered next to our table. I'll definitely come back to try other dishes here and to see Jennifer sweet face again."}
{"text":"I have loved this restaurant since trying it out for the first time. Quality and price are both great and reasonable. I honestly haven't had anything I don't  like."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for sushi in the East Valley. The quality is always consistent and it's fast, fresh, and delicious. Ebi Ebi Love roll is AMAZING!! And the Yanagi Crunch. Mmmmm. Moved 20 minutes away and still make the drive."}
