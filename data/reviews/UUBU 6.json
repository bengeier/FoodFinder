{"text":"In an interesting location in the South Side Slopes.  Parking can be a pain, look for their lot on 18th.  

Old workers union meeting hall.  Check out the still intact dance floor and tin ceilings.

Almost everything I have had here rates high.
Bread baked fresh, in house.
For starter, try the seafood bisque of the truffle fries.
And as for mains, the duck and the striploin were winners  for me.
Avoid the crab cakes as they are quite salty.
Desserts to die for-try the cherry rhubarb tart.

Weekends there is live jazz, but a bit crowded.  If romantically minded, try week days and you may have half the place to yourself.
Lastly they do brunch, but I never tried it."}
{"text":"It's a very quiet restaurant, which I definitely enjoy.  The lamb is cooked to perfection.  Drinks are pretty delicious too.  Very unsuspecting place is a quiet neighborhood.  Good experience though.  Would go back."}
{"text":"Just got back, and had to Yelp immediately, because I was so disappointed.

My man and I have been looking really forward to eating here.... and now we wish we wouldn't of wasted our money.

Our waiter was not educated on the food, he was shabbily dressed and still acted like a snob.

They were out of the wine we ordered, and the bottle he just brought instead was horrible.

My pork was undercooked, my boyfriends steak was over cooked (he offered him A1 for 20 dollar steak - isn't that big time nono?), and they use heavy salty sauces to cover up there shameful cuts of meet.

Do yourself a favor and Save your money;  just buy a flank steak, cover it in soy sauce, and wash it down with a $2 dollar bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Being that I'm the first Pittsburgher to review UUBU6, it pains to me rate this typically superb restaurant with only 2 stars. But unfortunately last Saturday night, my lofty expectations fell well short of what we had experienced here before. We arrived early for our reservation at this funky spot up the hill on the South Side, and decided to have a drink at the cool bar of what used to be the Workingman's Beneficial Union No. 6 lodge (somehow they get UUBU6 out of all of that). I was excited to see a large beer tub full of one of my favorite beers, Blue Point Hoptical Illusion, and quickly ordered two for the guys. Our ladies each decided on a pomegranate martini which were so strong even I had a hard time taking a sip. The four of us were seated in the grand main dining room with the yellow and green checker board ceiling and the dramatic yellow drapery. But unfortunately after we sat down, the staff forgot we were there. We waited almost 20 minutes until a server approached us and asked if we were ready to order. I said \"we would be happy to order if we had menus.\" You can see where this night was headed. The server apologized and quickly returned with our menus.  UUBU6's menu tonight looked nothing like the menu on the website (it does say \"menu subject to change upon the Whim of the Chef\" ) but I have to say we were very disappointed with the night's offerings. The entire first page was a Lenton menu ( this was a Saturday night) with 8-10 seafood specials. But the biggest disappointment was the fact that there was only one appetizer (asparagus frito misto) to go along with 3 or 4 salads. Are you serious???   The app selction on the website had so many different choices and our only option was asparagus which also happened to be the vegetable of the day?  Fortunately I saw a very attractive cheese and fruit plate on the dessert cart next to our table and we decided to order it for our appetizer. The waiter obliged and it was actually a very good selection of a Maytag blue, a brie, a borsin and a smoked Gouda to go along with the grapes, strawberries, crackers and bread. The wine list is extensive and is attached to every menu, so after finally settling on a bottle of wine, we were sorry to learn that it was unavailable. Our server suggested a similar California Red from the $20 bottle list. I was confused because none of our menus had this value list. So he returned with another menu and we were lucky to have a very good Cali Pinot Noir.  The salads were just okay with a blood-orange vinaigrette.  Nothing to get excited about.   But  my seafood bisque was very flavorful and hearty. My lady ordered the Hangar steak with mustard sauce and sweet potato fries. Our server informed us that he thought they were out of it so he asked her for a plan B in case it was unavailable. After another 20 minutes, we motioned to our server to see if she was getting the hangar steak and he informed us that there indeed was one left. We wished there hadn't been because the steak came out a little overcooked, but drowning in mustard flavor. But her biggest disappointment was that the accompanying fries weren't sweet potato, just plain ordinary steak fries. She wouldn't have ordered the steak if she had known they were out of sweet potatoes and our server again neglected to mention this to us. As for my dish, I went in ready to order either a duck or a lamb dish from the website but of course neither were on tonights menu.  So I decided on the soft shell crabs with spring onion and tomato relish. I chose poorly.  The \"salsa\" on top was just that, chopped tomato and sliced green onion.   But that was the least of my entree's problem. The soft shells were so salty I could feel my blood pressure rising with each bite. It was almost laughable but by now I was too hungry to send them back. Apparently it was contagious, because the accompanying asparagus also seemed to be inflicted with this same salt problem. In fairness, our dining companions enjoyed their dishes, I especially liked his Angus beef tenderloin (we like to try each others dishes) but his wife's salmon dish was a little on the dry side. The dessert cart (again, none of the desserts on the website were on the cart tonight) sells itself with the elegantly arranged trays of small cakes and pastries. The ladies' Chocolate flourless cake wasn't very awe-inspiring but a strawberry Napoleon with whipped cream was sublime. All things considered, and because of my $50 gift certificate (thanks WPXI Just Pay Half) our final tally came to $65 per couple.  All things considered, UUBU6 can give you a pretty good bang for your buck with the $20 wine list and also a $30 recession buster prix fix feature.   So as you can see, you can get pretty good value here.   As long as the kitchen and waitstaff  rekindle the commitment to excellence that I had come to expect when UUBU6 first ascended up the slopes of the South Side."}
{"text":"We moved to Philadelphia last August and of the few things that I miss about Pittsburgh, living down the block from UUBU is at the top of that list. 

I still think about the delicious pierogis and the always-wonderful desserts here. Miss you guys, Tom, Diane, and Mike! Shout out to all the Slopes' regulars who also frequented this place for dinner + watering hole at least 3-4 times a week."}
{"text":"I moved in down the street from this place and was excited to check it out. However every time I tried to go during their posted business hours, they were closed.  This is because they ARE NOT OPEN everyday.  The owners keep their Facebook page up to date with when they are open.  So don't think about going without checking their Facebook first!

Now onto the food experience. The restaurant had a very local, personable feel to it. Upon entering my friend and I were greeted by the owner, who introduced himself, and asked for our names.  The other customers seemed to be Southside slopes regulars.

I ordered the sliders and fries, which did not disappoint. Each slider was a 1/4 lb burger, which could hardly be considered a slider. And while I prefer thin crispy fries, the thick cut steak fries were very good.  I will definitely be back now that I know how to tell they are open!"}
{"text":"Very limited menu and an unusual location. Had a hard time finding parking. I had the chicken parm sandwich which was just o.k. My friend had the shrimp alfredo which was good. I will say the prices are cheap and the portions large. I just wish there was more to choose from. If you want a cheap divey place then this is your spot."}
{"text":"Uubu 6 is a bit tiny, but it's pretty unique. We came for Thanksgiving dinner, and if you can use it as a basis for the rest of their food, it's pretty good.

As the below poster said: they bake bread in house. We got the most delicious, fresh, warm rye bread (and I typically hate rye) with a plate of tasty, melty butter. Next was a delicious mushroom bisque, followed by a decent salad with pomegranates, raspberries, and walnuts. They served a good, but typical Thanksgiving plate with all the fixins. For desert was a dense chocolate cake (and I suspect flour-less?), which was quite good.

They have a large wine menu, and recently have added a $20 bottle page. Also our server was an incredibly friendly and pleasant, despite the stress she must have been under due to the high volume of large families coming in. Parking is kind of a pain though, the \"lot\" for customers can probably only fit 6 cars, luckily they have a valet to deal with that. There is street parking across from it, but there's no sidewalk. I would drop your guests off at the restaurant before parking on South 18th Street as your passenger side will be extremely unpleasant to get out of."}
{"text":"I really really love uubu!!! My best friend brought me here after her and her ex boyfriend used to come here. Well the boyfriend is gone bust the restaurant is staying!"}
{"text":"Great little hidden place...friendly staff...great food! Diane (waitress) takes the cake though...she's hysterically awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't show up to UUBU6 expecting a great meal. However, it's a neighborhood place in a funky old Union building with a bunch of regulars and 2 dollar beer special. It's the only restaurant in the South Side slopes, and you can't hate a neighborhood joint.

...unless they charge your credit card twice for your meal and you pay 40 dollars for a burger. Worse still, that very burger was an inedible 2 pounds of meat, burnt on the outside and raw on the inside, laying inside a tiny bun. Even the pickles from a jar tasted bad. My 10 dollar house red tasted bad. My expectations were low. But if the burger isn't even edible...come on.

Maybe you could come here for a beer? But first just throw a frozen meal in the microwave at home. This was even more disappointing because we have tried to go to UUBU6 half a dozen times, but the hours are inconsistent. We've even shown up 30 minutes before closing time to find the door locked, and the waitress, Diane, just stared at us from down the hallway. 

Persistence did not pay off on this location. If you don't live in the neighborhood, don't even think of making the trip. If you want a \"cheap, divey spot\" there are plenty of other places on East Carson that serve bad food. It is quiet though. One star for being quiet and having local high school football on the tvs."}
{"text":"They closed. They re-opened. Their hours are questionable, but they are a great deal for happy hour, have an extensive wine list, and serve reasonable comfort food. Call ahead."}
{"text":"Good food and unassuming location.

I've eaten here twice and thought the food was excellent. They don't have many choices at any particular time, but everything put on the table has been good. 

The Valentine's special menu for $66 per couple including a glass of wine, shrimp appetizer, salad, filet, crab cake, vegetable, dessert and coffee was by far the best deal on a meal I've had in years. The three couples left wondering how they could serve so much for $33 a person.

What is particulary appealing is low-key, quiet nature of this place. You can hear the other people at the table without shouting."}
