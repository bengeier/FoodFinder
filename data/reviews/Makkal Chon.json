{"text":"first things first, i live and die for pork bone soup so pretty much any korean joint with a solid gamjatang wins my favour. what i love about this place though is all the side dishes that you get with your meal and they don't serve you just regular steamed white rice (not that there's anything wrong with steamed white rice, i grew up on that stuff for breakfast, lunch, and dinner) but they serve you this purple rice... i wish i knew what it was called but it's great! and i always appreciate little differences like that :) definitely a go-to when i'm in the area"}
{"text":"Makkal Chon is an authentic Korean restaurant that's famous for serving vegetable wraps (ssam). It's a very fun and hands-on experience as you get to try a variety of leaf vegetables and mix-and-match them with different pieces of meats (such as bulgogi, chicken teriyaki, mackerel etc). You get the benefit of having fun, playing with your food and also knowing what you're eating is very healthy. The whole vegetable set dinner comes with a plentiful selection of ban-chans that can be refilled any time at your request, Korean soybean paste soup, purple rice and your choice of meat dish. Everything was served fresh (especially the veggies; very crisp and green) and tasted great!  The restaurant has a woody decor feel to it and is very warm and welcoming as it's a family-run business. As for service, don't expect it to be quick as this place gets busy sometimes during dinner hours. What's worst is that there's only one server tending to 10 different tables. The night I went was a disaster as the restaurant was not busy, yet dishes were left on the table for more then 30minutes before it was clean - im reffering to tables that were left dirty after customers finished eating and had already gone. Not a pretty sight but besides that point, I had happily enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"Good service, reasonable prices and most importantly excellent food. Its the first time I have had Korean food and I really liked it here.. I do recommend the grilled fish, it was very good - hope you have a good appetite, cause it's a whole fish and it's good for atleast two people."}
{"text":"It is my staple place for authentic Korean. Food is great, very comparable to actual Korean food in Seoul. But service is quite slow - maybe understaffed for a place that is often packed on weekend lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I'm not Korean but I love Korean food. Makkal Chon has excellent customer service skills and their food is good!"}
{"text":"I love the side dishes here!!!! I think side dishes are the highlights;)   The price for the food is a bit high. But I think it is totally worthy!"}
{"text":"My favorite korean restaurant in Toronto! Definitely a lot of competition for korean food in Toronto but I come here the most often because it's the best korean food in Scarborough. It's authentic korean food with a good amount of spice. My favourite dish is the spicy ribs - super spicy but great flavors. The side dishes are also really nice, they usually change it up a little every week. Super recommended, definitely need to try!"}
{"text":"The pork bone soup is one of the best in the city. Full of flavor with just the right amount of heat. The side dishes I think are the best in the city, I love the eggplant side dish.   The service is a little slow, so make sure you are not in a hurry when you come here to eat. Definitely the best Korean food in Scarborough hands down."}
{"text":"One of the better korean places I've been to. Pork cutlet is fried well and crispier than other places. Pork bone soup was also seasoned well and the meat fell right off the bone. The appetizers are also higher quality; their eggplants have a teriyaki taste to it, and their potatoes are great too. Overall, the quality here is great and service is average."}
{"text":"Maybe I was expecting more after reading the positive reviews. The food was not bad but I wasn't wow. Prices are average but not cheap. We ordered the pork bone soup, kimchi stew, and the vegetable wrap for 2 people (mackerel and spicy chicken). Balchans were good and better than standard, my favourites were the eggplant and sweet potatoes yum! Food does seem \"healthier\" here, fresh veggies, purple rice. Flavours are pretty good and right amount of spicyness, but again I just wasn't \"wowed\". Service is pleasant, and although the restaurant was full and there was only one server, we didn't have to wait very long for service or our food. Lots of Korean customers so it must be authentic. Soups were $8.99 and the veggie combo was $25.99 for two people."}
{"text":"Im a fan of a Korean pork bone soup. So when I learned it has 4 star from fellow yelpers, I bribe my friends to try them.  We ordered 2 bowl of pork bone soup and 1 beef rib soup. Payed $30.46 plus tip.  Soup is good, not too spicy though I ordered mine spicy. Love the purple rice. Side dishes were good esp the sweet potato, kimchi, eggplant, cucumber. We were hoping for a japchae bachan but waitress stated they dont have it for the day. Ask for another round of bachan (potato,cucumber, eggplant and kimchi). Asked for a 3rd round sweet potato ONLY  and waitress  stated only 2nd round of banchan is allowed although there were 3 of us. My friend likethe beef rib soup. Kitchen is clean as we peak thru them while we were paying our bills. My friend said washroom is clean too. Infact she said this one of the clean Korean Restaurant. I would definitely go back and try other dishes. Waitress keep refilling our tea as we stayed there for 2 1/2 enjoying the food and chatting."}
{"text":"Hah. So my boyfriend's mother happens to be from the same area as the ajima who owns/cooks for this restaurant. We now come religiously, and they practically know us by a first name basis.   The ban chan (appetizers; ie. kim chi, jap chae, etc) is very indicative of the area of Korea that the ajima came from. The ban chan here are clean tasting, not greasy, and not msg-ed. The service is as speedy as one cook can get, although she has hired some helpers (though they only prep while she cooks).  I almost always order the soon tofu chigae from this place, and it's the only place I found comparable to the soon tofu place on Yonge (The place that practically ONLY serves soon tofu soups). The soup comes in a small stone pot, and is served with purple rice (much healthier than regular jasmine rice). They also bring these little wet nap pellets that grow to a normal sized napkin upon watering.   The prices are comparable to those on Yonge, but I definitely feel that the quality and taste live up to the prices. I highly recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"More like a 3.5  I came here with my boyfriend on a Friday night before the dinner rush started. We got the vegetable wrap combo that came with the soybean paste soup and two sizzling plates(we ordered bulgogi and grilled pork). The meat was great, no complaints there!  The vegetables offered were nice, huge assortment and plenty left over after we finished off the meat. I have to say, despite what the other reviewer said, I did not get any perilla leaves? I also notice that some people got bok choy based on some pictures listed here. What I got were romaine lettuce, green leaf and red leaf lettuce. Boiled cabbage, kale and, I think, rosemary?? I guess what vegetables they offer depends on what's in stock. I would have liked to try the perilla leaves.  For side dishes, the server arranged it into a nice 7 pattern. I was pleasantly surprised to see dubboki! I love it but normally refrain from ordering it when I go out because it's usually overpriced on most menus.   The soybean paste soup was kind of bad. Really bad.   Atmosphere wise was really nice until the dinner crowd showed up. Because we were seated pretty much right next to the door, I kind of felt like I should rush and hurry instead of enjoying my meal. I think it would be smart if they set up a fold up partition or fake wall next to the door so the waiting crowd aren't right there staring and a bench outside so people can sit and wait.  Overall, I think I'll come back to try it again."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times now and as everyone knows, it's one of the most popular Korean places in scarborough.   The food is great, server are so passionate and friendly."}
{"text":"Very very impressed with this place. I'd kept hearing about the quality of food and portion sizes.  Hidden in a corner of Scarborough this Mak Kal Chon is a true gem. Staff are polite and attentive. They even moved us to a bigger table because as they said the amount of food won't fit. We only ordered 2 combos! The salad wrap combo B is insanely good and portions are unheard of for the price. The side dishes were home cooked. And to top it off the combo came with a huge bowl of spicy tofu soup?!?! How do they make money?!    This is my new favourite Korean restaurant. Authentic, delicious, and welcoming."}
{"text":"The food was OK, maybe 3 stars but the service was horrible.  Although we got seated quickly,  we were without water until our food came.  Anything that we needed we had to ask for it twice. My tea was never refilled and not even one server came back to check on us.    I understand that they are busy but that would mean that you would at least take care of the basics like spoons for the soup that came with our meal.  If you see 5 people and there is only 4 bowls of rice coming out wouldn't you bring out an empty plate or bowl?  We didn't even get that.  We ordered the wrap for 2 and didn't get any dipping sauce.  When we asked for it,  they acted surprised before bring out one type of sauce when the picture showed 4.  I understand that things change but they could have told us.  Reading other reviews, they all got dipping sauce. Eh at this point nothing surprised me.  All in all,  the food didn't out weigh the service.  Save your money and try a different place."}
{"text":"My whole family loves this place as it is close to home & most of the dishes here are very well-made and closest to what we can replicate at home (or sometimes better than that). Only God knows how many late nights we've spent here when work ended late & no one felt like cooking/dishwashing. Sometimes it's very difficult to find seats. Service is extremely slow on those premium/scarce seating days. The longest time I've ever waited for anything there-- was 30 minutes. For hot tea/water! It was mind-boggling.  Everyone's favourite 'Pork Bone Soup' is a robust, red, spicy Korean earthenware pot of heaven. It is way better than Owl of Minerva's gamjatang & I really hope they don't deviate from their original recipe or change it up too much.   I almost always order the 'Spicy Soft Tofu Stew' with seafood. Not with beef though. Unless they use a better cut of meat next time I go there. 2-3 visits ago I got fatty cartilaginous bits I could neither chew nor swallow.   I love their 'Dol-Sot-Bi-Bi-Bab' with their usual purple rice (guessing it's made up of 20% Thai Black Rice & 80% Japanese White Rice). It was difficult for me to finish & I was very hungry at the time.   The 'Mushrooms on Rice' had a wimpy Teriyaki-type sauce that deeply perplexed me with its gloopy texture & too-light colour. I hope they improved it. I love mushrooms and would appreciate a wider variety of them + a more robust sauce.   The side dishes are not very good. I sometimes wonder why (aside from the Kimchi subtypes, pickled or stir-fried dishes) they bother putting them out at all. The starchy syrupy potatoes are too gooey & some other dishes are just too random.   As much as I love dwenjang (Korean miso), there was this fern bracken or other unknown vegetable tossed to coat in this miso-based seasoning & my tastebuds were bewildered into barely making a dent in it-- in spite of the smallish serving.    The 'Udon' was pretty good. They made the broth very light and kind of anchovy-flavoured to suit Korean palates. I quite enjoyed it. Haven't had their udon in awhile. Perhaps they made it a bit more authentically Japanese by now? I wonder.   The Mackerel 'Vegetable Wraps' were delicious! I love the array of fresh leafy greens they bring out. It's quite a beautiful & impressive presentation that makes you feel good about all the DHA & vitamins you're about to consume. My family has even speculated the owner grows the veggies herself.   The 'Spicy Salad Liquor Combo' sounds tempting but half my family are allergic teetotalers (this includes me) & my mother makes such a killer spicy whelk (sea snail/bai-top shell) salad with Somen or Soba, I feel like I'm setting myself up for disappointment."}
{"text":"For a local eatery this place rocks. It's a small restaurant and during the week has only 1 waiter but he does a good job attending to everyone. I go a little early around 6 and it's not too busy...by the time we finish place is full...once food is ordered it comes out pretty quick. I've had the pork bone soup here and it's hands down better than owl...the spicy tofu soup is really good also a little more spicy than other places which works for me. My fiance had the lettuce wraps which were great...I tried the marinated pork and had awesome flavor.  Love that it's close to home and would never have even known about it if it weren't for yelp."}
{"text":"very poor customer service! Not friendly at all. I don't think I would come back! When I was there, it was pretty busy, but the guy who at cashier, his attitude is disgusting, keep saying some dirty words in Korean. Ignored customers request.  Haven't tried the food yet, but the service...s"}
{"text":"We didn't expect to find a korean restaurant in this area which is famous for the shawarma.  It's around 2.30pm, past the lunch time, surprisingly it's still full. There were lots of old korean 'aunties' gathering. Perhaps it's the sign that it has high standard.   It's much better than our expectation, in fact we like it more than our favourite korean place - Nak Won. Both the main and side dishes taste better. We ordered Jellied seafood tofu soup and hotpot bulgogi. There were 7 side dishes - huge portion.  Another note - the ones serving us, both of them look quite young, very polite. Wish them the best."}
{"text":"They always seem to be understaffed and busy.  You can expect a reasonable wait.  However I highly recommend sucking it up as its definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is one of those not quite hidden gems of the Wexford neighbourhood in Scarborough. It's out in the open but not unless you go around that area or know of people who have been there, you can often overlook it.  The location is in a small plaza right beside a Karaoke place and a PAT supermarket. Their service is alright but often lacking and more than often understaffed. Most of the staff that do work there are friendly and try to get to you ASAP when they are busy. So one word of advise, just be patient with them; it's a small place that sometimes only have one floor person to work and man the cash register.  The interior is wooden and almost home like. Food quality is superb. I've come here so often that I have had the chance to try several of their food items.   Some of my favourites are the pork bone soup, tofu stew, dol-sot bi bim bap, bulgogi and galbi. They give you plenty of side dishes that are made to serve on that day (so every time you come there, it's always something different!). The best part is that the side dishes are refillable without extra charge.  The menu is smaller than most Korean restaurants I have been too but it's so straight to the point that they are able to focus on the quality of their food that they serve.   Love this place and would recommend this place to anybody that is looking for quality Korean food!"}
{"text":"Efficient and welcoming service, friendly staff.  Food arrived promptly and was presented appealingly.  Delicious taste, ordered the bulgolgi and thoroughly enjoyed it! The meal came with a variety of nice side dishes each with their own unique taste.  Would definitely recommend this authentic Korean restaurant experience."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an actual Korean restaurant and not Korean-Japanese or Korean-Fusion, then Makkal Chon is your place. I've eaten here many times and my go-to dishes are the Bi-Bim-Bap (assorted vegetables, meat and fried egg served over rice in a sizzling stone bowl) and the Pork Bone Soup -- hot, spicy and rich! Each meal always starts with a tasty assortment of banchan (side dishes) that differs day to day. At first glance, the portions don't look big but they're filling. The service is friendly but when they're busy, can be slow. It's a small restaurant and they are usually full during peak dinner hours so I recommend going early."}
{"text":"I have been to almost every Korean restaurant you can think of in Toronto and this is by far the best, hands down! Small little gem in Scarborough but don't let the outside looks fool you. Food is fresh and plentiful as the portions are very very good. Pork bone soup is fantastic and would highly also recommend the  2-3 people shared menu item. Actually you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Service is fast, and staff are very friendly. I eat here once a week and everything is consistent. Side dishes are amazing also, different and fresh as if they make it new every day. My son is a very very picker and he loves this place. Price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great food great prices great service/5  This place is seriously good. Great appetizers coupled with huge portions and excellent service rounds out a fantastic restaurant experience.  Don't sleep on this place!"}
{"text":"We have now been there three times and each time was a delight.  Food is amazing, service helpful and polite.  Large selection of delicious free appetizers, well prepared and presented. Twice we had the the ssam (lettuce wraps) and they were beyond delicious. Huge portions, fresh ingredients, and yummy, yummy korean food.  What else could we ask for?  Can't wait to return. Note: there is always a lineup there so prepare to wait - well worth it."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and upon arrival, found the place to be a bit small. There was another couple waiting ahead of us and there were two empty tables that weren't cleaned yet. The two waitresses there didn't bother to bat an eye at us and worked at the pace of a tortoise. It took them 10 or more mins to finally and slowly clear our tables. We ordered their veggie wrap, which looked to be their speciality and a kimchi stew. The wraps were good, but the kimchi stew could've been better. The side dishes weren't bad, but the celery side dish didn't look fresh, surprising since their lettuce wraps were very fresh.   Overall, the place is only okay, and I am a huge frequenter of Korean places. A better place in Scarborough is Incheon House."}
{"text":"Spicy Bul-go-gi on rice + Chicken Cutlet with rice  My babe and I decided to try a random restaurant that neither of us tried before. We stumbled across this place and we were surprised that this tucked-away little restaurant had such good food. it was delicious and really filling. And fantastic side dishes!"}
{"text":"Great find in Scarborough! I no longer need to go to Yonge street for great Korean food."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get Korean food in Scarborough! They serve a bunch of side dishes a long with the meal which is great. The food is amazing as well. The staff are really nice and attentive.   The restaurant is a pretty small and is a little pricier than most Korean Restaurants. Also, if you're planning to go here for a quick meal, this isn't the place to go as it does take a while to get your food. However, I feel they make up for it with their great tasting food!  Overall, I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great Service. There's a reason this place is packed. :)  I can't really add anything to the tons of good reviews, some of the prices have increased marginally, but still amazing value for the food quality.  Extremely friendly wait staff. we will be back again."}
{"text":"Where should I start? I need something to eat while I was at the Warden and Lawerence intersection. So I brought up Yelp and looked for nearby restaurants and found this one.  Reading the review and the surrounding areas, I was thinking: How could a fine Korean restaurant exist in such place?!  Anyway I press on, since the reviews seem genuine. I am so glad that I did.  This is probably one of the finest Korean restaurants in Toronto.  The vegetable wrap is amazing. It's so fresh that it feels like it was just taken out from the farm. The appetizers are great and in huge quantities. Love everything there. The environment is clean and the server is good  Since it's family run, it may take more time to serve if the restaurant is full."}
{"text":"First time here and I got the bul go gi on the hot pot and it was delicious! Beef was fresh and tender. The sides were also great tasting."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup is the best i ever had in Toronto and sidedish are fresh and yummy! Like the eggplant sidedish. Pork bone soup is $9.99 a bit of higher than other restaurants but large portion and rich soup base. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Food - 5 stars Everything else - 3.5 stars   We came after 8pm on a Wednesday night and there was a couple waiting ahead of us. Groups of people were soon leaving the restaurant, so I didn't think it would take that long. But it did. I peaked inside, and there were a bunch of empty tables but not cleaned up. I noticed 2 small tables were clean, but I assumed they wanted to seat us at the better tables and thus were making us wait until they could clean it. Not so - after unnecessarily waiting for 15 minutes or so, we were seated at the awkward middle small tables since they were the only ones clean. The wait for food was longer than expected, but everything was delicious. We got bulgogi & pork/octopus wraps - awesome. I give the food 5 stars, but the messy restaurant (where more than half of the tables remained dirty for the entire time we were there), unnecessary waiting, very slow service and not letting us sit elsewhere (after I asked) puts this at a 3.5 for me."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a Korean joint in Scarborough this is the place to check out. A friend told me about this place and the first time I went I was hooked.  There is a good selection of food here from diy wraps, pork bone soup, bimbimbap, grilled pork, korean short ribs and the list goes on. The food is great and easy to share.  Along with your meal various side dishes are also added. You may not like everything offered but you will find something you like.  Staff is nice and helpful."}
{"text":"My friends and I went for lunch on a weekday so there was no wait and we were seated quite quickly.   Food was delicious, and the appetizers were very tasty as well! My friends got the seafood/tofu stew which was very good and a reasonable sized portion. Another got vegetable wrap combo which came with a lot of food (small bowl of tofu stew, plate of veggie wraps, and a meat platter)! I personally got the udon soup which was okay, nothing special but no real complaints either.  The service is okay, though one of our servers didn't really seem to understand English very much.  All in all I was pleasantly surprised! Would come back to eat if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent Korean food. Ordered a combo meal for two $30 comes with two bowls of rice, two choice of grilled meat, 1 bowl of soup, 1 large platter of assorted lettuce wrap, and 7 plates of banchan.  I would love to come back more often if it weren't so far for me. But do expect long wait times for service."}
{"text":"My fav Korean place in Scarb.  Side dishes are a nice variety.  The quality of food and service are reliably good.  One thing to note is that there's usually a line up as it is a smaller restaurant."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect based on the appearance of the place, but was not disappointed at all.  The banchans were of a generous size, and seconds provided promptly when asked. Food was very tasty, and very reasonably priced. Will definitely have to come back again when to try the other options on their menu!"}
{"text":"We always come here. Great side dishes and good tasting food. Gets busy at times so you might have to wait for a seat during busy lunch hours. Their family meals are a great deal coming with a variety of vegetables for wrapping. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Good plates and not too expensive, appetizers are really good, I enjoyed the eggplant side dish a lot and the beef ribs are delicious. It's also very close to a Korean supermarket just in case you want some Korean junk food too."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Makkal Chon Cuisine: Korean Location: Scarborough Address: 1979 Lawrence Ave E Price Range: $10~15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 5  Service: 3  Ambiance: 3 Overall: 4  Extra information:  * Parking at the front * http://www.makkalchon.com/ * Small seating area * Sells alcohol  Everyone asks me where my favorite Korean restaurant is in Toronto. Most of the time, I found it hard to answer because I never really went out to have Korean food. Yes, I go occasionally to have Korean-Chinese style food that's somewhat hard to make at home and maybe a Korean drinking place here and there...but authentic Korean food? that was a tricky question for me....until my friend took me to Makkal Chon in Scarborough.   There are plenty of restaurants that I can take non-Koreans to because I know they will order typical things like BiBimBab, Pork bone soup, Japchae or Seafood pancake. However, most Korean restaurants in Toronto I find their food to be a little too sweet. That does make it much easier for non-Koreans to enjoy, however, it makes me cringe and leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth.  Anyways, long story short- I found a hidden gem in Scarborough that serves authentic Korean food and the important thing is that they do it well. The restaurant is quite small so I would suggest going in smaller groups. Both times I went, there was only one server working so stay patient.  Ordered: Wraps Combo (Basic vegetable wraps and choose 2 meat) 5/5  * 2 bowls of rice, vegetable wrap, soy bean soup and 2 types of meat for $24.99 * Choose from Bulgogi, Chicken teriyaki, spicy chicken, mackerel, spicy pork, grilled pork or spicy squid * We ordered Spicy Pork & Spicy Chicken * Both of the dishes were not too spicy and best of all, wasn't too sweet * Stir fried with sliced onions and green onions, they were best eaten with rice * The meal comes with 7 side dishes, none of them were the 'typical' sidedishes that all Korean restaurants serve * To name few of them, there were spinach namul, sweet potato, kimchi and japchae * Instead of just giving you lettuce, they give you a basket filled with different types of veggies you can use to wrap up your meat * Ddaen Jang Jji Gae was thick in consistency and bursting with flavor * Second time I went back, I ordered Spicy chicken & Grilled Pork  * Grilled pork was somewhat sweeter, but had mild bbq flavor and reminded me of bulgogi * Pork was quite fatty and it was dripping with fat which the onion on the bottom helped to catch * For $24.99, this was a really good deal * I could tell all the food was high in quality and they actually care about what they put out on the table * This is a must try!  Ordered: Spicy Squid on Rice 4/5  * Stir-fried spicy squid with vegetables on rice for $9.99 * This was not too spicy and it was really good with the purple rice * Basically you can eat it separately or mix it with the rice and eat it * Really big in portion and came with lots of squid  Summary: Makkal Chon serves real quality Korean food, it's not in heart of downtown- but it's close enough. If you are sick and tired of the typical BiBimBab, Seafood pancake and Porkbone soup- give Makkal Chon a try and you will get to experience what real Korean food taste like."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup and wrap combos is my to go dishes here. Pork bone soup is on the little more expensive side but it is worth it."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here last night with much excitement and now I know why.  This Korean restaurant is very authentic with incredibly delicious food and a very warm staff.  The place was busy all throughout the night with customers constantly flowing which means that the food is fresh. Their portions were also very generous and were nicely presented as I'm sure you can tell by the pictures.  Bul-go-gi - Sometimes when I look at bul-go-gi, it looks as though it won't have much flavor because of the colouring.  Theirs however, was bursting with flavor. It was served on a hot iron dish that was literally steaming.  The portion was also large enough to serve 2 people or 1 very hungry individual.  The meal was served with many assorted cold side dishes such as eggplant (5/5), kimchi (I'm not a big fan so I'll skip the rating to be fair), japchae (5/5) and so on.  The dish also came with rice which was absolutely delicious. 5/5  Pork Bone Soup - Perfect for a rainy night like last night.  The very tender meat fell off the bone and the broth was also very flavorful.  I would definitely go back, just for this dish. 5/5.  Squid and Pork Wrap - Their vegetable wrap was nicely presented.  It also came with rice, which you can add to your wrap, but being the Filipino that I am, I just kept eating the rice with whatever protein there was on the table.  The dish also came with Ssam sauce which complimented the meats very nicely.  And of course, both the squid and pork were incredibly delicious and flavorful.  I did wish that the ratio between the 2 would be more equal.  And whatever sauce they cooked it with, was on point! Made you want to just drench your rice or dip your lettuce wrap in it.  5/5.  If you're looking for an authentic Korean restaurant and want to avoid Korean BBQ restaurants, I highly highly recommend this gem in Scarborough."}
{"text":"For those of you looking for a real authentic koan joint I highly recommend this place  Get the lettuce wraps. Such interesting and complex flavours."}
{"text":"I'm used to come at lunch time. This is one of my favorite Korean restaurant. We ordered combo A today, you can choose two of meat dishes, and it comes with a tofu soup and two rice. The food is great and service is friendly."}
{"text":"My wife and I also enjoyed our meal at Makkal Chon. As Eune y. suggested we ordered the Sahm. The vegetables were fresh and the meat wasn't bad. If the meal had a problem, the squid was sub par. The dwenjang (bean paste soup) was good and the pahn chan (side orders) were decent also. The interior is nothing to write home about but my wife and I certainly  would go there again.  The server was also very nice and accommodating to us, even though our baby was screaming and throwing food on the floor most of the night."}
{"text":"I went there today with my girlfriend for her birthday, food was excellent, but the service was very disappointing. They didn't even nod or pay attention to us throughout the whole meal except to bring things over, and didn't even say happy birthday. Not that we were expecting a cake or something, it left us both feeling a little cold.  Update: Makkal Chon didn't like my negative review and tried to get it taken down. I've downgraded my rating to 1 star."}
{"text":"I've gone here three or four times now because it's the closest Korean restaurant that I know of. To be honest, I don't think this is the best food. I've been to other Korean restaurants that I've thought were much better. But it's a nice place with reasonable prices, and the ambience is pretty nice, so I continue to go there, (until I've found a better one in my area).  Worth going to but not worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"My friend and I drove down from Ottawa and wanted some tasty Korean food. The waitress was cute and peppy, the food was delicious.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in the city for authentic home cooked Korean food. It's my go-to spot in the east end to satisfy a kimchi jimm(pork belly kimchi stew), stone pot bibimbap, or pork bone soup. They also always serve a variety of ban chan (side dishes) and I'm always pleasantly surprised by some of them (like the apple and pumpkin potato salad.. soooo good).. The only downside is that the place can get extremely busy and I don't believe they take reservations or a number so you have to line up which must feel like torture as you see the carts of food being rolled out. I suggest you come here in smaller groups (2-6). Excellent food and I'm sure with time they will update and renovate the restaurant, so keep on supporting these family run businesses."}
{"text":"We came to Makkal Chon off a Reddit recommendation. Initially we found that the place was very small, but cozy. It has an authentic Korean aesthetic and we immediately eyed the appetizers. The place is very busy, and expect service to be a little slow because there are too many people.  However, we were pleasantly surprised. Food came quickly, and all at once. The pork bone soup is well season and the meat falls off the bone, while the mackerel vegetable wraps were crispy, salty, and refreshing. I've never had vegetable rolls, but aside from an odd soggy leaf everything was crisp and fresh.   The appetizers are delicious, and there are many! Eggplant and kimchi were our favourites.   The meals come with rice and the tea is tasty Korean rice tea. They serve it using an interesting tea ladle!  Overall Makkol Chon is probably the best Korean I've had in the GTA. would definitely come back and the meal is both affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"Well, I was so excited with the vegetarian Korean Traditional stew (p.s: it's lots onion in).  The restaurant offers 6 to 7 appetizers while customers waits for their orders.  The restaurant keeps clean and tidy... just the seats are not much enough when people dine in \"rush hour\"."}
{"text":"Spicy is pretty spicy, be careful. We got a grilled fish, it was enough for two. Spicy bulgogi was made of tasty fire. But everything is fresh and delicious.   Fulfilling dinner for 3 for $50? Oh, yeah!!!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing and the atmosphere is cozy as well.  I brought my sister here for a dinner she enjoyed food a lot.  Even the side dishes were so tasty and great consistent!  They are small restaurant so you might need a line up and feel little bit of rushing."}
{"text":"I've been on this tip lately about trying as much different type of cuisines as much as I can. Korean food is definitely one of my favourites right now especially with the fact that I love spicy food. My friend told me about this place and how she liked it. The food is good, definitely filling. Price is definitely good as well.   I recommend their Spicy Pork Bone Soup (YUMMY), the seafood pancake thingy, and their wraps. Everything that I tried so far from there was yummy sooooo, I definitely am coming back."}
{"text":"My fave korean resto! Trumped my previous fave \"Tofu Village\" in koreatown! Why is it my fave now? All the soups a lot more flavorful; u can taste the quality in the ingredients; the free side dishes are a lot better quality than other places; so manyyyy choices!  Been there twice and am looking for to coming many times more to try all the other dishes! Hidden gem, in a plaza in Scarborough, just happened to go to this place cuz was yelping for a place nearby when i was around there, and this resto is def a keeper!   Prices were reasonable because the portions are big and the food is filling. Yum craving it now!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmy! I really like how they had a lot of bunchan  (complimentary appetizers) to eat while waiting for our meal. They serve purple rice instead of the basic white rice with your rice dishes so it's an added flavour profile to the dish! Those were just some extra things I noticed. Servings are really generous and everything tasted delicious!  I think we found our Korean resto hot spot in Scarborough!! Holler!"}
{"text":"Always a fan of small restaurants. Tried the pork bone soup, it comes with a healthy purple rice and 6 side dishes. A lot of food for $10.99. More importantly everything taste delicious. Definitely coming back. The menu is pretty extensive ranging from a quick meal starting roughly $10-$30per person. Very reasonable for the amount of food they give you. I was there after 2pm and restaurant was still half full.  Personally I don't really eat spicy dishes so next time I will ask them to make it less spicy, but I'm sure it is the perfect amount of heat for most people."}
{"text":"I got the bulgogi a few months ago, and it was pretty good. The menu options were descent, however they didn't offer ALL of the Korean foods I love. The side dishes were really good! I would suggest going here if you're unable to make it to the West or North end Koreatowns. Overall, though, pretty good!"}
{"text":"It's a nice little restaurant. The dinner for two, where you choose your meats is great. Price is decent. If it's busy I just order takeout."}
{"text":"Ahh I'm so happy my friend introduced me to this place! I've been looking for comfort Korean food at affordable prices other than the usual mainstream spots which aren't even that great. It's a cozy and small restaurant which is perfect for what they serve - super clean as well.   My girlfriends and I went on a Friday night to find that it was pretty packed! Luckily we were able to get seated right away. We ordered the tuna kimchi stew, kimchi fried rice and the bulgogi with rice! Everything tasted great, including the side dishes (bomb side dishes are key to a great Korean restaurant!!!) However, it would've been a lot better if the kimchi fried rice wasn't so oily - there was oil collecting at the bottom of my bowl.   NOW TO SPILL SOME TEA. Unfortunately the only thing that made me dock one star was with how slow the service was. It was understandable that it was a busy night, however - we would ask for a pitcher of water and the servers would never bring it for us, rather we had to repeatedly ask them for some water. Also, when we asked for some refills on the side dishes, the servers gave us a very rude look or ignore us when trying to call them.   I'll be giving this place a second chance just because the food was so good. Hopefully the next time around the servers won't be so ignorant as they were during my first visit."}
{"text":"I REALLY like this place because their food is actually amazing and they don't cheap out on side dishes BUT be prepared to wait. Wait for someone to clean your table so you can sit (because they're pretty busy), wait for someone to bring you water/tea and menus, wait for someone to take your order, wait for your side dishes, wait for your food and finally wait for your bill (walk up to the counter to speed this up). Your 1 hour lunch/dinner just turned into a 1.5 - 2 hours meal. BUT I am completely okay with waiting because I really like their food and staff. It's a family run restaurant so they do take a bit (as in a long time) longer than other restaurants.  Overall, yes I will come back when I have time ;)"}
{"text":"100% the best Korean food in Scarborough and definitely at least top 3 in the GTA. This family-operated shop has a great selection of items and all the favourites such as the pork bone soup are expertly crafted and taste great. They like to change their appetizers around seasonally to keep things fresh for repeat customers, and there are lots of those at Makkal Chon!"}
{"text":"One of the better Korean places in town and I've been all over Toronto from North York to downtown Christie. Their side dishes are really the highlight. I'm not sure how tradition some of them are but it's really fun and tasty. Happy to see some of their inventions. The menu items are a dollar or two more than the average place, but well worth it. I should be coming here more often. They are usually packed so perhaps show up just before or after peak eating hours."}
{"text":"Awesome little Korean restaurant.   Generous portions and plenty of appetizer dishes.   Ordered the vegetable wraps with 2 kinds of meat.  Usually used to feed 2 people but there was so much food it fed three of us.   The vegetables were super fresh and crisp allowing for easy wrapping. We ordered the non spicy pork and bulgogi. It was quite possibly the best bulgogi I ever ate.  Pork was deliciously fatty and succulent.   There is a bit of a wait as it seems it is a true mom and pop operation but the convenient store front parking (free) made up for it.   I was so stuffed that I was glad my car was just 20 feet away."}
{"text":"I always get either Spicy Soft-Tofu stew or Dol-Sot-Bi-Bim-Bab, both of which you can't go wrong. Occasionally I stray and get something else but those two I go back to more often (yes, I go here quite often). I love their side dishes. They change every time I come in. The best is the marinated egg plant, the sweet yams covered in what looks like liquid sugar, glass noodles with veggies and their seaweed. What I love most about this restaurant is their purple rice that they serve with every dish.    The downside is that it is always so crowded and the wait can be terribly long. They need to hire more staff members because every time I come in there's always one or two servers. So get there early or you might have to kill time by walking around the P.A.T grocery store right besides them. Once we sit down the wait for the food can be very long as well. Other than that the food is very tasty and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"5/5 Food 5/5 Service 4/5 Decor 5/5 Price Overall 5/5  Oh man, this place is great.  I've never had such variety in side dishes, and my companion tells me that they change it up very often. Most places serve only 5 side dishes, this place does 7! Too bad you can only refill up to 3 side dishes, but with the high quality it makes sense.  I disagree with the other person who mentioned that people think Makkal Chon is great only because there isn't really other Korean food in this area. I've eaten Korean all over Toronto and this is definitely one of the better spots for it.  Bulgogi was tender and well flavoured, my companion really enjoys the pork gamja tang. Side dishes are the bomb."}
{"text":"This is my first choice for Korean food in Scarborough. Its the best korean option you can find in the area. Good apps, good service. Prices are decent considering the lack of competition. Their BBQ combo is decently priced and of good cuts. Traditional looking Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"Decided to try out Makkal Chon after some of my Korean customers had told me this place was one of the best in Toronto. The place is good but I wouldn't say the best.   The Food Food was good but nothing special. My bf and I shared a vegetable wrap combo with grilled pork and spicy chicken which were both served on sizzling hot plates, an assortment of leafy greens, dipping sauce (ask for sesame oil with salt, adds more flavor to the meats), two rice and a fermented soybean paste soup. The pork was good, the chicken was okay but the salt and sesame oil were its saving grace. The soup was very disappointing, usually it's one of the first items to be finished but we barely touched it. The banchan, for the most part, was amazing! There was one side dish that we all strongly disliked which was the seaweed/cucumber combination, it was no bueno! The kimchi was good, still nothing special, BUT the lotus root, tofu, and dried radish were by far my favorite side dishes.  The Service The servers was great! They were all very nice and attentive! They even asked a group of two if they would move to another table so they could accommodate our larger group of 5. Place was pretty busy too and we still got great attention.   Service was great and food was okay. If I ever go back it would 100% be for those side dishes."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and the food had previously always been consistent. I really enjoy their kimchi bacon fried rice or the pork bone soup if I'm feeling hungry because I know they're really tasty and will for sure fill me up.   Tonight, instead of ordering individually we shared the wraps combo ($29.99) which came with two meats, two multigrain rice (I much prefer this over white rice that I find a lot of Toronto Korean restaurants opt to serve instead), bean paste sauce and a side vegetable soup. They're pretty generous with sides, on average we get 7 sides every time we come however it varies from time to time. My personal favourites from them would be the sweetened yellow potato (which we didn't get this time) and the sauced eggplant. They are absolutely delicious and I'd finish eating them in a heart beat ! I really enjoy their wraps because they always come with fresh veggies however this time for some reason they weren't as fresh. I still do appreciate their thoughtfulness in serving multiple greens so you could try different wraps and experience a different taste every time. For the meats we chose grilled pork and bulgogi ! Previous to this visit I've never had grilled pork before but I will be getting it for sure from now on and the bulgogi is great as per usual !   The only downside i would say is that even on week nights 9/10 times you'll have to wait to be seated cause it's a cosy restaurant, and there's typically only one server so you can't expect stellar service.   Despite the down sides I keep coming back because their food is actually really tasty !"}
{"text":"Took my friend here for lunch for the first time. We both had the Pork Bone Soup and Bibimbap. Food was great. Only reason why I wouldn't give this a 5 star is simply because it took them 15 mins to give us menus at the beginning. Pricing for food was a touch more expensive compared to other Korean restaurants.  Other than that, definitely a great place in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Food is good but wait time for table (15 mins), for appetizers (40 mins), and food (50 mins), for a Friday night is outrageous. They seemed to be too busy to refill tea and give more napkins etc. They need a major renovation and more space. They also charge 20-30% more than regular Korean places."}
{"text":"Amazing food all around for a decent price. I got a veggie wrap combo, which came with the banchan, a tofu soup, different types of leafy veggies, and 3 different meats. We chose the bulgogi, grilled pork, and spicy chicken as our meats, and all delivered. The pork was nice and sweet, with just enough fat, the bulgogi was also sweet as expected, and the spicy chicken had the tang typical of spicy korean food. The venue itself was small, but the servers were all friendly and food came out on time. The food came out to around $50, and satisfied 3 very hungry people, with some left over. Will definitely come back to try more, and would recommend to anyone with a craving for bulgogi"}
{"text":"Food is clean and portion size is reasonable. Food quality is equivalent to that of yonge and finch. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is hidden away in a area in Scarborough not known for Korean fare.   I always order bulgogi at every Korean restaurant but decided to order the pork bone soup and turbot fish as well this time. They were both very delicious. All dishes come with the purple rice and it pairs very well with them. The side dishes are the best I've ever had. The kimchi here is perfect. And they can be refilled for free!   It's a small restaurant so expect to wait during the busy times. They only have a handful of tables. It's run by a small family so food will take longer than usual if they're busy.   Overall this is my go to Korean restaurant whenever I'm in Scarborough."}
{"text":"We had a great meal here, particularly loved the lettuce wraps with several different choices of meats, a terrific dolsot bibimbap with purple rice, and a wider selection of interesting banchan appetizers than most places. Also, there's a great selection of 4-5 different leaves to use as 'lettuce wraps' which keeps things interesting. Neighborhood is a tiny bit sketchy of course, and the place would be very easy to overlook dropped in the middle of a Scarborough strip Plaza, but as a mid-range Korean restaurant by price and quality, this place really is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Brought my parents here for my dad's birthday and my parents have very particular tastes, so needless to say the expectations were high. Considering they are the only legit Korean restaurant in this part of Scarborough I was really excited to try their food.   There was a line up for a table, clearly this is a popular spot, and we ended up waiting 15-20 minutes for table for 3. Not a bad wait considering we didn't make reservations and it was a Friday night. From here, the service slowed down a bit. I get it, they only had two people working and the restaurant was full but it was still frustrating as I had wanted this to be a really nice dinner for my parents. Thankfully, the food was delicious, I mean, really exceeded mine and my parents' expectations.   We ended up ordering the Pork bone soup (the pork was fall-of-the-bone good and broth was flavoured well), the kimchi stew with pork (not my fav), the Bulogogi vegetable wrap, and the grilled beef short ribs which I could eat endless amounts of.  After I accepted the service was just going to be slow, I was able to really enjoy the food.  So if you're going here and they're having a busy service just be patient. It's worth it, I swear.   I wouldn't recommend this place for big groups, unless you're able to reserve a spot. The prices here are pretty decent as well."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this meal. We ordered combo B veggie wraps (grilled pork, bulgogi and mackerel), pork bone soup and kimchi fried rice. There were 5 adults and a toddler. That was just enough for all my of us.   The veggie wrap combo was good, bulgogi and grilled pork were tender and tasty the mackerel was flavourful. The dishes weren't greasy and weren't full of msg. I personally liked wrapping but everyone else thought it was unnecessary.   Pork bone soup was amazing, my favourite dish from this meal. I would go back and just have the soup, perfect for a cold rainy day.   Kimchi fried rice was too spicy, it was the only dish we didn't finish.   We went on Sunday around 2:00 pm, the restaurant was half full with steady traffic. The service was slow considering it wasn't too busy (took 15 mins for ban chan, about 30 mins for food) and they weren't attentive (had to ask 3 times for tea). With drinks the meal was ~$80, so not too bad for 6 people. I would definitely go back and recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a great find in my neighbourhood. The quality of the food is for sure up there, the price is also a bit higher than the regular Korean places. I do think it is worth it, Makkal Chon has managed to match its quality to price. The food is tasty, flavourful, without being overpowering. The appetizer is delicious, first time I had kimchi that made me feel like I was having kimichi ~ hot and spicy! I tried the summer special cold noodle, didn't really know what to expect or how to eat it properly. The server brought the food over and without me asking, gave me quick 1-2-3 step instructions..and what she would recommend and not recommend. All in all...I am so glad this place is so close to where i live, I am looking forward to trying other dishes!"}
{"text":"last time   I got the bad service.  but today everyting was perfect.  food always good ."}
{"text":"The place has good Korean food but the customer service is bad unless your older an Korean person. So if your willing to deal with bad service then the place is good for the food."}
{"text":"I came here during dinner time after seeing such great yelp reviews, but holy crap the wait for long. I can't blame them because it is quite a small (but cozy) restaurant. The poor waiters were running around like mad men, please tip them well if you go  :(. The food was pretty average, it wasn't anything super awesome but it wasn't bad either. Their side dishes are impressive though.   I only one star less because we were starving but they kept forgetting to give us our side dishes before our food came. So we sat there for about 15-20 minutes with our tummies growling. Good thing it was quite loud or that'd be embarrassing :D the food is actually a bit pricier than other Korean restaurant, but I guess their extra side dishes and purple rice makes up for the cost. Any Korean restaurant that serves you purple rice automatically wins in my book"}
{"text":"Finally found a decent Korean cuisine in the Scarborough area! Everything on the menu is affordable, the pork bone soup was $10.99 and the side dishes were big portioned compared to a lot of other Korean restaurants. Everything was flavourful, definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good given the limited options for Korean in Scarborough.  I do like their little apps. We've been there at least 10 times.  One thing that gets to me though and were not likely going back.  It always takes forever when we eat there. They are usually understaffed and the last time we just walked out. That was the last straw. For the amount of time it takes to get a table, then wait and order, then wait for the food, we can drive to Korean town and pay half the price for a better meal.  Be forewarned, it will take you a long time if you go there."}
{"text":"go here quite often.best pork bone soup hands down.better than the ones i had in korea.took lots of friends here and they enjoyed it quite a bit.it gets quite busy during the weekends dinner"}
{"text":"This place is medicore at best. I understand that side dishes are important to some people, but they aren't to me. Although they have good side dishes, their main dishes was medicore. The service is slow and spotty. Try avoiding coming here during weekend lunch hours as the wait is long!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Took my parents here for dinner one Friday and it was packed to the gills. Awesome food and great service, we got mackerel, squid/pork and chicken lettuce wraps, served with a slew of side dishes, and we were absolutely stuffed."}
{"text":"This place is a favourite for my friends and I for Korean food. Only place in Scarborough to get authentic Korean food. Though the service is slow due to it being family-owned, it is worth the wait. The signature dishes to get of this restaurant are the wraps combo where you can get 2 or 3 meat dishes with the lettuce wraps. It also comes with a spicy tofu soup on the side. The best meat dishes to get would be the grilled pork and the mackerel. We have tried the bulgogi and spicy squid and pork. The beef bulgogi is okay but the spicy squid and pork is quite spicy for our palette. The plate of lettuce wraps also comes with a variety of leafy greens such as romaine lettuce, cabbage and kale with some other pickled leafy greens and fresh herbs. Their pork bone soup for 2 people is quite worth it and lots of pork bone for more than 2 people. We also like their dolsat bibimbab which is the Korean rice cooked in a stone bowl mixed with pork, egg, and vegetables with their signature sauce for it. It is quite good and great they make it with the purple rice which is healthier than white rice."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with two colleagues.  We enjoyed ourselves, but probably won't be returning.  It's not terribly close to work and wasn't quite good enough to justify the travel.  Makkal Chon had several strikes against it early.  We have tended to eat beef, grilled at the table (Kalbi/Galbi or Ju Mul Luk), and Makkal Chon doesn't do BBQ at the table.  They do have vegetable wraps with meat, but the only beef option was Bulgogi, which is thinly sliced and not nearly as tender as the cuts we were able to get at some other Korean restaurants.  Nonetheless, we ordered the vegetable wraps with bulgogi, beef teriyaki (not on the menu) and the short rib soup.  The wet napkins to start the meal were amusing (they expand them from little pill form) and helpful.  The barley tea was mixed with jasmine, and I couldn't really taste the barley flavor (then again, if you don't like the barley tea perhaps this will encourage you).  The short rib soup was very simple, but tasty.  The little korean appetizers were plentiful and tasty (although they weren't refreshed once we finished them).  The sundubu / soon tofu soup was good, but not as good as the one we've had most often.  The vegetable wraps came with plentiful wraps, most of which were leaves that were too small or too sparse to really serve well as wraps, adn the bulgogi and teriyaki beef were good, but just not up to the better cuts of beef we've had elsewhere.  All in all, we enjoyed ourselves, and the meal wasn't overly expensive, but it just didn't stand out in any way, and isn't likely to draw us back.  Don't avoid this place, but don't go out of your way either."}
{"text":"Oh myyyyy .... hidden gem         ..........    Don't hesitate to come here. Authentic."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. One of the best Korean restaurants in Scarborough. You'd have to go to Christie or Yonge and Finch to get the same level of food. Their specialty seems to be their vegetable wraps. Really good! I would recommend the grilled pork vegetable wrap combo. TLDR; awesome Korean restaurant in the heart of scarborough"}
{"text":"Love their side dishes. Their soups are consistently good not so much of a fan of their pork bone soup but love their clear soups. Their meat dishes are really good too. A little pricey compared to Korean restaurants at other locations with more competition but they don't play around with their ingredients. Legit."}
{"text":"As mentioned the service is really hit or miss and there is always a queue as the place is quite small.  Food is good and authentic (majority of the clientele were Korean so that also speaks volumes). We ordered the wrap set with an additional plate of kalbi for 5 which was enough for all of us without being stuffed .  The banchans were all quite good however was told that the eggplant and the fish cakes were all gone only to see the next table served them just barely 10 minutes later. Coming from Markham, this is a bit of a trek so when compared to others in the Yonge and Finch area it doesn't really warrant the trip down. However if you are in the area, it is cheap and cheerful option with good food."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time since I read the great reviews on Yelp. I have driven by at least a dozen times in the past, always missing the small sign in white and green. Came here today for lunch at 12:45pm with my BFF.  5 tables were occupied and there was just one girl attending to everything. The wait for 2 pork bone soups took almost 30 mins!   Typically at Korean restaurants they bring out the sides while you wait for the main dishes.....not this place.  You have to wait till the main dish is served before you get the side dishes.  Now the food. Pork bone soup $10.99: 2/5. They killed it with the black pepper! The soup was not hot when served. We also ordered a bulgogi hot pot $12.99: 3/5. The size was teenie tiny, but at least it was piping hot. Side dishes: 2/5. Again, black pepper sprinkled on every dish.  Honestly, I think this place is over-hyped. Maybe because it's the only Korean restaurant in the area, but I suggest driving further west to yonge or north to Steeles. You will find lots of better Korean restaurants with better food & service."}
{"text":"Quality food. Never disappoints. Great vegetable wrap options with grilled meat or fish, and the menu is simple, traditional, and one of the best Korean food in town."}
{"text":"great portions and very authentic! when we were there, everyone around us were speaking korean! there was a lot of banchai (the eggplant and sweet potato ones were especially good.)"}
{"text":"I really love the food at makkal chon. If I am reviewing the food alone, I will rate this 5 stars! However, my recent visit to this restaurant hasn't been too pleasant.   They are under staff. But still you can be under staff  and friendly. Yet all the servers here were not friendly at all.   When we asked for extra side dish, they said they ran out. However, both tables next to us got some. We were not difficult customers (asks for little and don't cause trouble) and were just trying to have a nice meal just like everyone else, it makes me feel upset that we were treated poorly and differently than others.   Also, they keep forgetting to refill our tea, we asked twice. And when they do refill, they only refill one cup.  Makkal chon is still one of my favorite Korean restaurant. But I would come here less often now because despite how great the food it, the experience here is not pleasant."}
{"text":"Visited Sat Sept 16 for dinner. Be prepared for a long wait, there is no hostess to keep track of how many people are waiting in line. People end up waiting in the tiny entrance to the restaurant.   Pros  Really good side dishes as mentioned in many reviews.  Amazing pork bone soup it's a pretty big portion, and we ended up taking most of it home. Chicken cutlet was crispy and tasty.   Cons   Wish they had more photos on the menu so we can see what the food will look like.  Be prepared for a 20-40 min wait!  Damage - $28 includes tax, before tip."}
{"text":"This has always been the go-to authentic Korean spot for me in Scarborough. I took a friend here who just came back from a month long Korea trip when she said she was having withdrawals from missing the amazing food she had there. She loved it.   Fast forward a few months later and the service has been slipping mightily. I noticed anytime the \"younger staff\" are in charge of the front of the house, this happens.   I came in with two friends a few weeks back and while we stood near the door waiting for a spot to free up we watched as multiple tables tried to flag a server/worker to grab the bill. Eventually one of the patrons just got up and just walked to the kitchen and waited there to pay. This probably should have been the first sign that service wasn't on point on that day.   Even after that, we watched as three tables paid and left while the staff chatted in the back of the room with no urgency to clear any of the tables to have us seated. Their backs were actually turned to the room for a good ten minutes.   I could have swiped every chopstick in that rahtid place and they never would have known.  When we were finally seated, one of my friends came in about 15 mins later and was not offered water or tea, or an extra plate even though we mentioned another individual would be coming to join us shortly.   To me, customer service is almost everything. I ended up paying for the bill myself since it was my suggestion to come here. I would never let my friends pay for a bill when the experience was that poor.   Sad that this place has gone down hill the past year. Might give this place another chance but will probably peek through the window to see if they have parental supervision for the waiting staff on that day before even stepping foot inside."}
{"text":"Give it up for Korean food done right!  Had the kimchi samgyeopsal, the pork belly was done right and the kimchi was very flavorful.  Would go again!"}
{"text":"A solid Korean establishment in Scarborough. Makkal Chon does offer some unconventional but tasty fare which makes it a treat to visit. We ordered the pork bone stew to share; stacked with meaty bones, however we only had one potato. The flavor was great however just a tad short of umami. We also ordered a steamed pork belly platter. This dish was interesting and delicious, all the pork belly pieces were meaty. Service is okay, they didn't check on us to refill the banchan or water but they did get super busy with a line waiting. Definitely a worthy visit!"}
{"text":"I never knew this place existed until I saw a YouTuber mention it, and it's so close to my house!   Went here on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't that busy, we were seated right away. My boyfriend and I got the Vegetable Wrap Combo A with Chicken Teriyaki and Bulgogi, and pork bone soup. We like the variety of the side dishes, and the pork was tender. The wait might be awhile for your food, but I think it's worth it. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"3.5* This place was a late night pick and it was good. We ordered the pork bone soup and Kim chi fried rice. They came with traditional sides except the honey potatoes were squash. The pork bone soup had a different flavour than what I have had at other places but good none the less. But what made it great was how much meat there was! Usually sound have more bone than meat,  this definitely had more meat than bone and then some. Kim chi fried rice was standard that I've had at other places. For a decent Korean place in the Scarborough area that's reasonably priced, I'd come here to get my fix."}
{"text":"Defiantly my go to place to take my girlfriend, friends and family out for a nice dinner. This place is small and hard to see when you are driving in the area. But the food here is amazing! Hands down the best Korean food I've had.   Im a pretty picky eater when it comes to foods and I really like eating the same thing a little more than I like trying new things on the menu. So I always go for the chicken cutlet. Not only is the chicken cooked to perfection, the rice is outstanding in my opinion.   My girlfriend on the other hand gets either the pork bone soup which is a must try, or the veggie wrap combo that can come with either 1 or 2 choices of meets. Now I've witnessed her eating the food and her expression says it all. Defiantly a place to go and check out!"}
{"text":"Came here on a friend's recommendation and now I understand why the reviews are so good. It is probably one of the better Korean restaurants that I have tried! It seems like all the best food joints are in the hood. Located in the Scarborough-Wexford area in a random plaza beside a Korean grocery store and of course under the Kim's Convenience billboard sign, this is a small restaurant with about 10-15 small tables. The first time we tried to come here there was a lineup and this time it was the same but throughout the night. We knew that this place must be good if people don't mind waiting minimum 15-20 mins. So after we sat down we also waited another 30 mins for our food but it was super busy and clearly the 3 servers wasn't enough to handle the volume of customers. It's okay though it was well worth the wait because the servers apologized for the wait and were even friendly.  We decided to order the lettuce wrap combo with two meats and the pork bone soup that everyone was was raving about in the reviews. And ...wow must I say that despite the level of spiciness of the soup, it was delicious. The portion was massive, they definitely didn't cheap out on the meat and not to mention so much flavour and literally fell off the bone as you were eating it. The wrap combo we got to choose two meats: chicken teriyaki and bulgogi...both came on a sizzling plate bursting with so much flavour as you eat it wrapped up with lettuce and sauce. The combo also came 2 bowls of  purple authentic Korean rice and tofu soup. The entire combo was only $30 enough to feed two people. And last but not least the appetizers were so good!!! There was a variety with kimchi, rice cakes, sweetened potato, bean sprouts, and eggplant! You can ask for unlimited appetizers if you'd like.   If you are looking for a place to satisfy your pork bone soup craving, come here, you won't be disappointed. This restaurant doesn't take reservations so try to come before or after dinner hours or just wait in line. I assure that the wait isn't that long. :)"}
{"text":"Probably the best spot for Korean food in the Scarborough area. Their wrap options are really good and not too commonly seen at other places. They offer a good variety of side dishes as well.   However, the service is pretty bad. This is the closest Korean restaurant to me which is why I come here regularly but the service kills me. Every. Time. They never seem to feel the need to clear vacated tables despite the huge line at the door. I've literally stood beside an empty table for 10 minutes while there are several servers around who could be clearing the table. Also, it's not uncommon to wait for service... Whether it be for menus, to place your order or to ask for more water. Lastly, they don't give you the side dishes until your dish is ready... But with their service standards, that could be a while.  If they find a way to improve the service and better train the wait staff, this place could be amazing. Even worth the higher than avg prices for Korean. Until then, it's good food but at the cost of terrible service."}
{"text":"Food was average however a bit pricier and portions are a bit smaller than most Korean places. Services are very slow (all 3 times I've been there). The side dishes are amazing (kept me coming back). Worth trying especially when you are stuck in that part of Scarborough with no other places to go..."}
{"text":"We had the combo A veggie wraps with grilled pork and bulgogi. It came with 7 side dishes, bean paste soup and 2 bowls of rice for $27.99.   Food: 3.5/5 I liked the veggie wraps since they give you many different types of veggies. You can make a wrap with the meat, side dishes and rice. I personally like the grilled pork with lettuce wrap. The side dishes were okay, kimchi was good but others were average. Bean paste soup tasted weird and sour, didn't seem too fresh. Overall it was good but not very memorable. Although it was a lot of food in the table, you get hungry quickly since it's mostly vegetables.  Service: 1.5/5 Don't expect much from the service, you gotta wave them down for everything and they don't bother to ask you about the food."}
{"text":"Food quality and pricing is always the best here! True authentic Korean food, with new renovations to the restaurant. Relatively busy in the evenings because it's the place to be when seeking out Korean food! However, the service can be a hit or miss sometimes. As a consistent customer, I've had some days where the service is exceptionally great and days where it's been a complete mishap. Overall, I still remain a happy customer for the quality and quantity of the food. Always flavour full!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best authentic Korean restaurant in Toronto but it's not anywhere near Korean town. It's a small family run restaurant located on Lawrence E and Warden Ave.    Service can be painfully slow as there is usually one server but the food makes up for it. They have amazing side dishes- they are always fresh and super authentic (some side dishes they bring out represent specific regions of Korea e.g.) acorn jelly. Side dishes vary every time I go which to me is very important.   I highly recommend wraps combo, steamed dish & stew or full course Korean meal as they are great food to share your meal with your friends/family, experience traditional way of eating Korean food and to satisfy your hunger!   Server is very friendly and attentive. The restaurant itself is super bright which kinda bothers me some times. Everything on the menu is made to order and the kitchen is pretty small so don't be surprised if you get your grilled fish at the end of the meal (which happened to us but I didn't care as it was fresh and delicious).   I would highly recommend Makkal Chon to anyone who's looking for authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"Food was very good, and very reasonably priced.  Service however was just ok.  We stood there for 15 mins and no one acknowledged us.  We did not get service throughout the meal, ex tea refill, extra napkins and bowls for soup."}
{"text":"The best Korean restaurant I've tried. Ample portion sizes, great taste, and a variety of side dishes all at an affordable price.  We've been going to Makkol Chon whenever we are in Scarborough. If you come on the weekends, expect a line - a slow moving one. The restaurant serves each table in a first-come-first-serve basis (meaning a table must get all their food before they start serving the next table), and it can take some time between arriving and when food actually arrives on the table. But be patient, friends, as the great things come to those who wait   Our favourite dish to get and a must-try item would be their lettuce wraps. It comes with your choice of meat, soybean soup and a hefty basket of different lettuces and herbs. For meats, we usually get pork belly and bulgogi, but if you would like some heat the spicy pork is also very good. I love the fact that you can conjure so many different wrap combinations with this one dish - be creative and add some rice, other dishes and even some side dishes into your wrap! Tie it together with a spoonful of soup and you're solid.  I also recommend the kimchi fried rice and pork bone soup, both classics that would not go wrong."}
{"text":"The Kimchi stew was fantastic! Maybe the top 3 I've had since being back from living in Korea. Lots of side dishes too and a good amount of food for the price. The stew was so flavorful and lots of meat and veggies packed in. My coworker ordered the bibimbap and was extremely impressed.  The service however was quite slow for one server during lunch hour. Would not recommend going during lunch if you have a short lunch break. I would go back again but will adjust my time accordingly."}
{"text":"I was surprised to learn that Makkal Chon was located on Lawrence Ave. in Scarborough as this is not a neighbourhood I would expect to find a Korean restaurant.   Makkal Chon is easily one of the best Korean restaurants I have had the pleasure of dining at. Coming in on a cold Friday evening, and feeling a bit under the weather I opted for a hearty Kamjatang (Spicy Pork Bone Soup). This soup was an otherworldly experience, and possibly the best kamjatang I have every had. The portion was massive with large, meaty chunks of fall off the bone pork. The broth was spicy with a good mix of spices and pepper that gave it a complex flavour. Overall this was the perfect bowl of soup that left me feeling warm for the next few hours.   The banchan (Korean side dishes) were plentiful (we got about 7). All the banchan were clearly made from scratch and with care. My only complaint is that the service here was a bit slow, it took a while to be seated and even  longer to get our food. In the end this wasn't such a big deal, I will gladly wait for my meal to be cooked with care, just be warned not to come here too hungry.   I for one cannot wait to come back to this hidden Scarborough gem."}
{"text":"Went to check this place out because we were in the area and a friend recommended this place for Korean.   Service was good - came in a got a table. I thought the food was also good. Definitely go if you're in the area, but I personally wouldn't travel for it.   Ordered the veggie wrap- bulgogi, and pork bone soup. I enjoyed the meal but I can't say it's been my favourite place to have them. Don't get me wrong, they're good. Just not the best I've had.   What I did love were the side dishes that came with the meal. I usually find that at other Korean places, at least one of the side dishes doesn't hit my taste buds fully but I loved each one here.   Would come again if I wanted Korean food and was in the area."}
{"text":"I like Korean food. I lived in Seattle for a while and there is a lot of good Korean food there, downtown Toronto has some good places too. Michigan so far, I have found to be lacking. I was actually rather shocked to learn there is a good Korean restaurant in Scarborough of all places. So I had to check it out.  The decor of the place was really nice. It had a very traditional seeming type atmosphere. The waitress was really nice. Sometimes when you go to a place to eat, and you aren't a part of that ethnicity you get the impression that the servers and staff are sneering at you. Or they are just not really that friendly. I didn't really get that impression here.  We paid 14.99 and we go a giant fish player with 7 sides, rice, and soup. Which even in terms of Korean food is an excellent price. Two of us ate quite easily within that amount and the food was really good. Naturally of course I loved the Kimchi, but that is the most recognizable Korean delicacy around.  So, when I take into account the service, the restaurant, the price, the overall experience, I would have to say that this place is really in the category I would define as excellent.   On a side note, I had lunch, so I skipped on Soju which I might normally have. That wasn't priced bad either."}
{"text":"This place wasn't very clean for a Korean restaurant and service is expectedly a little slow but it's good if you look past that.   We found this place in search of korean lettuce wraps. Not sure if I just didn't pay attention to other korean restaurants or if not many serves the wraps. We got combo a and came with 2 choices of meats. We got bulgogi and the pork & squid, very flavorful and fair portions. Cold noodle was smaller but reasonable.   They have different side dishes and were all very good.  Down side is that you can only refill 3 of the typical side dishes.  We'll be back for the lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on Friday, parking is fairly easy, since the plaza doesn't seem to be very busy.   Pros: The wet napkin is very thoughtful as most asian restaurants I go to don't provide. Love the side dishes, very neat, great taste. A lot less MSG than the famous Korean restaurants, which is a very good. The purple rice is very healthy, I am amazed this restaurant uses such a rice.   Cons: The side dishes unlike the other Korean restaurants, they only come before the main dishes arrive. Time for the food is also kind of slow, since there were only 2 tables(including us) waiting for food.  Overall I would actually give a 3.5, but since Yelp can only choose 3 or 4, I would give it a 3."}
{"text":"Visuals were really good but taste was definitely not up to the price. Overpriced for food taste and service. Waiters were rude. Not sure if they were being discriminating or they just forgot but we and another table weren't served the very basic thing at any Korean restaurant while the other two tables were. When we asked for more tea the male waiter just abruptly placed down the tea pot for us without saying anything and walked away. We were not satisfied with anything in general and won't recommend anyone to come here."}
{"text":"according to the website, the veggies are organic. I'm not sure how the other stuff tastes but I have been here a few times and I only order the veggie wrap sets, cause there's lots of types of veggies and it's very fresh and crispy.  There's a few selection of meats to choose from for your meats and it comes with many sides dishes. beef, pork, squid...  cons: very small place. The tables usually seats 4  (and can not be split so 2 people takes up the whole tables) There's about a total of 8 tables in there. This place has potential to fit a lot more. but the tables are too big and spaced too far apart. -1 star  The waitress work at a super SLOW pace, It's like watching things go in slow motion, even when they put down those side dishes, they do it slowly one at a time and had to be arrange nicely on the table, yes it's pretty but, we waited forever. - 1 star  There is always lots of people waiting (and people eating, eats in slow motion also) they don't take numbers, so you just have to know your spot."}
{"text":"I came to Makkal Chon on a Sunday afternoon around 1:00pm. They had just opened around 11:00am. We were one of the three tables that were occupied. The server came and gave us water. I asked for tea. The friend i was with has allergy to spices and everything they had were spicy. So my friend got a pork cartillage soup that was non spicy and i ordered gam ja tung. Our friends were hungry so they asked for the house side dishes . They only refilled 3 of the 6 sides. At the end, my friend complained that her soup hardly had any meat inside, only just broth. The waiter asked me to pay for tips when they didnt even serve us that well."}
{"text":"Good authentic Korean fare east of the DVP.  Their banchan are very generous and the food is consistently flavorful and fresh. For a small restaurant, they have a good menu selection to choose from.  It gets pretty packed no matter which night of the week so I like to show up by 6pm. I get my Korean food inspiration from them!"}
{"text":"After ordering, we were first served a small dish of Tampons and then she poured some warm water which then the Tampons reconstituted to some Wetnaps.  Unfortunately those Wetnaps were not edible as we waited quite a while without any Banchan and we were first ones to visit and barely any other customer arrived. (-0.5 Star)  When the Banchans came there were a good selection and shortly after we were served our meals which then took over all the table for 4s real estate.  It's pretty awesome when you get a feeling that you're having a banquet size dinner with just having a simple family dinner.  We were close to finishing our Tea by now and we never got a replenishment. (-0.5 Star)  Cold Korean Noodle Combo(Noodle + Galbi) is a split decision and the method was unexpected.  Usually loving any Korean Beef dish, I have to dislike the Galbi which was fatty and simply not up to standard while the Cold Noodle had a good soup that had balance of flavours and with slice of Watermelon for Dessert on top(Just Kidding). (-0.5 Star)  Ginseng Chicken Soup was fine the way it was, with the Chicken stuffed with a Chestnut, Ginseng, Garlic, and Sticky Rice.  The Chicken soup was a bit light on flavour though.  A-OK  Spicy Squid & Pork Vege Wrap had some regular Squid & Pork where some Pork slices had some soft bones, but no big deal.  The VEGE was the highlight for me as normally the Chinese version for Peking Duck was simply Lettuce but here was Perilla, Cabbage, Lettuce, Frisee, and a whole Jalapeno Pepper.  Purple Rice was served which is always a plus.  A-OK  2.5 *Star*"}
{"text":"First time I tried this place out, it was on a Tuesday around 640pm, it was packed to the tits. I waited about 20 minutes to be seated at a table for 2; you'd think that this would annoy me, but it only excited me more - it's got to be a good sign, right?  I got the pork bone soup, extra spicy, and it came out in 10 minutes. You get a bowl of rice, the broth was full of flavour and there was a ton of pork bone and broth. I wasn't disappointed at all.   The sides (banchan) came out first, there were 6 little plates. We ate and loved every single one of them; our server never hesitated to refill any/all we asked for.  The service was great, for a small restaurant, they accommodate to your requests and they're friendly. I made a lame joke, today, and my server laughed. Automatic points; I'm hilarious.  It was so good that I came back, today, which was only 2 days from my first visit. This time I got the Pork Bone Stew for 2. There was more meat, 7 side dishes (banchan) and rice. Only thing was that there wasn't as much broth, but we had a jug of water that we kept pouring into our pot; you're probably thinking \"wouldn't that ruin the broth?\" Nope, the broth was so potent that it was still delicious!! Needless to say, I made that stew my b*tch. The bomb.com.  Definitely worth trying this place. So glad I found an amazing pork bone spot in the GTA (not everyone wants to drive out downtown or to North York)."}
{"text":"First time being here and as you can see, we couldn't wait to eat before taking a picture. The amount of side dishes you receive is really plentiful and definitely made with care. You have to wait a bit for your food to come out during busier times but its not a long wait. I ordered the wraps with spicy chicken; came with soy bean soup, purple rice, a lot of greens, spicy chicken stone plate and soy bean paste. It was really delicious, the greens tasted fresh and the soup was perfect. My boyfriend ordered the BBQ eel on rice and said it tasted amazing. The servers are really nice and attentive, but we went when it wasn't as busy. The atmosphere is nice and the music is pretty bumpin. Will definitely be back here again. If you're going to go, they have a combo special for two or three which lets you get the veggie wraps and two/three kinds of meats for 29.99. Since you also get soup and all the side dishes its a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"Pros: 1) Amazing food.  Got the Combo A - 2 meats w/ lettuce wraps ($29.99).  Chose the grilled pork and bugolgi. 2) Purple rice. 3) Made resos (apparently you weren't able to before).  Waiter was super nice. 4) Great/unique apps i.e. eggplant, rice cakes, etc.  Cons: 1) The lettuce wraps were difficult to eat imo.  Maybe I'm just a noob, but it was difficult to keep the meat and sauce in the lettuce wrap, thus it was a bit messy."}
{"text":"Legit korean food. Their best deal is the ssam meal. You get a nice portion of vegetables with great protein accompaniments such as bulgogi, pork belly, etc. Their pork bone soup is spicy and good, but make sure you can take the heat. The soup will grow ok you.  Definitely one of the best korean restaurants serving homestyle cooking dishes in gta"}
{"text":"We ordered Combo B for $44.50 which included 3 meat choices.  This proved to be just the right amount of food for the 3 of us for lunch (all with big appetite).  Of the meat choices:   1) Bulgogi: not bad, pretty standard with right amount of flavour (3.5/5) 2) Spicy Squid and pork: loved the squid, pork was alright. Would appreciate it if they provided more squid than pork (4/5) 3) Grilled Mackerel: **Value for money item!** quality was even better than some Izakaya places. Highly recommend it if you like fish. (5/5)   Nice side dish variety. Their sweet pumpkin side dish was very nice and I don't see that often in Korean restaurants. Spicy tofu soup was so-so.  They also give you about 3-4 different kinds of leafy greens to wrap your meat/rice/side dish/soybean with.  Service was a bit slow but tolerable considering the # of staff and how busy the restaurant was."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! Had the spicy pork bone stew and it was mouth-watering!! We also ordered the kimchi fried rice and everything was scrumptious. The food was worth the wait time as it is a small restaurant. Definitely planning to go back and try the other food options."}
{"text":"I would have to say this is my favourite Korean restaurant hands down. Before I lived in the area, I would drive an hour and half just to satisfy my craving. This is the only place I know that has such a huge amount of banchan with multiple refills. I would definitely recommend making a reservation if you're dining on a weekday, weekends they don't take reservations. It gets super busy there because of the food and because it's a smaller restaurant. The grilled pork vegetable wraps is what I get every time. Comes with pork, lettuce and vegetables to wrap it in,rice, this soybean sauce and a side soybean soup. The prices are amazing, and the service is great for how busy it is. I've recommended it to my friends and they love it as well. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Was a bit hard to find the first time. The signage doesn't stand out. The food is good, sides are excellent. Really busy place and small. Be prepared to wait at dinner time. There are larger restaurants with less of a wait. Unless you're in the area, I wouldn't necessarily go out of the way to eat here.  We had a hard time getting a waiter as we were seated in behind the crowd waiting at the door on a sub zero night. So it wasn't the best of experiences. But all that aside, they do serve good food and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Wow. Really? I've never written a review for Makkal Chon? Okay then. My bad. Makkal Chon is my favorite Korean restaurant in Toronto. Unfortunately, they don't do reservations and they're usually fairly busy. It's a small restaurant.   Like the others, I'd definitely agree that their wraps are where it's at. That being said, their bossam, another wrap of sorts, is also amazing. It's braised pork belly and I could be wrong, but I have a feeling that Makkal Chon actually crisps up their pork belly slightly after taking it out of whatever liquid they were braising it in, because it had a slightly crispy/fried taste to it. It's served with blanched cabbage leaves, some kind of non cabbage kimchi, and a very salty shrimp paste. The shrimp paste actually goes wonderfully with the pork.   The other thing about Makkal Chon is that their banchan/side dishes are amazing. They're seasonal, so they're not usually the same each visit. They've always got new things for me to try, which I love. All of their side dishes are tasty and colorful and presented wonderfully.  I wish they would expand so I would be able to come more often and not have to wait."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here. The portions were generous and tasty as well as the side dishes.  The side dishes were quite unique.  It can get quite busy.  I can see why the reviews are high.  I would come back again.  We ordered the bulgogi on rice, pork bone soup and dolsot bimbimbap.  There was a great amount of meat for each dish.  The bimbimbap had a great variety of veggies and flavour."}
{"text":"This was the best Korean food I had in GTA bar non. First I was unhappy with slow service.  To be fair there were ton of people waiting. But when the banchan came out, I can tell this was the real deal Korean food. When the food came out, I knew I was at home.  Do not hesitate to try this place. This is what an authentic Korean food taste like.  BB"}
{"text":"We got a table for four as one group just left. After we were seated we waited for 5 minutes and no tea or menu was presented to us. We had to wave to the waiter to come over. First time he came over he just dropped he menu on the table and left. He second we called the waiter we had to ask for tea and also provided our food order.   The service could have been better. There were 3 waiters available and they just ignored us. It was not super busy."}
{"text":"Love the Kim Chi stew! Authentic Korean!  Kalbi ribs are yummy.   Love bi bim bap on the hot stove bowl.   Small joint,  but cute and quick service.   Debit and cash only."}
{"text":"Server was not efficient.  We're waiting too long for our food. They served first those people after us. Will not coming back and also we request another item as an appetizer but she just returned the empty plate on the table. But anyway we tried this location that we thought food and service is okay but we are disappointed."}
{"text":"The side dishes here are amazing. 5/5. there are usually 7 dishes. My favorite side dishes are their eggplant and sweet potatoes.   Their vegetable wrap comes with a variety of vegetables including perilla leaves, steamed cabbage, kale, romaine lettuce etc. It is a must try!  Just a note, they do offer raw garlic and chilli slices upon request.  In terms of soup, I really enjoyed their ox knee cartilage soup and pork bone soup. Although the ox knee cartilage soupthe not as milky coloured as some other places, it is quite good still.   This place is my favorite Korean restaurant"}
{"text":"Finally came here after months of being it bookmarked!! It's a little hard to find - the sign is a bit small. It's in a plaza with a Japanese and Korean food mart if that helps. It was 2:30 on a Sunday and incredibly busy. We waited 15 minutes or so.   Inside, there's room for about 50 to sit. Service was a bit slow but there was like one person working the tables and they did the best they could! And the food is prepared pretty quickly.   We had the pork bone soup and the spicy pork which came with rice. The soup is served with a bowl of rice and an empty one for the bones. It's really filling, and delicious, and perfect for cold day! The spicy pork was also really good, a big portion and really saucy. And they served an assortment of apps on the house. All in all, so much food!! So much DELICIOUS food! We could have probably shared something or taken some home.   I can't wait to come back here. But I would check if they take reservations, if I'm planning on going on a weeknight or weekend. Apparently they're known for their salad wraps or something? I'll try that next time!!"}
{"text":"Makkal Chon is a homey, highly authentic Korean restaurant that serves up amazing food. At this time, I can easily say it is one of the best, if not the best Korean restaurant in the GTA. I haven't enjoyed Korean food to this degree nor have I eaten so much Korean food in one sitting before! It was that good.  First thing I notice is that this is a small and cozy restaurant and therefore there was only one waitress. We came on a weekday for lunch and it wasn't that busy. A common complaint was that the food took a while to come out and while that was partly true, it wasn't that bad/long. But I suppose that's because of the time we went.   We ordered the wrap combo A and the grilled fish (which is turbot). Each $30 and can easily fill two people, the sweetest part is that these meals included rice, soybean stews, and stuff like lettuce and greens for the wraps combo. And they don't skimp out on the amount they give you, as there was plenty of lettuce for the wraps. I can easily say this place has the best ssam I have had. You get your choice of two meats in the combo and we went with the grilled pork and bulgoggi.   You can definitely taste the quality here, and everything was so fresh and flavourful. You can tell they were delicately made just from how they look. The side dishes are phenomenal, no idea why the table beside us got oisobagi and we didnt... but every single one of them was great. Eggplant was my favourite. The grilled pork and bulgoggi were pretty standard but luckily they had some ssam sauce - very garlicky and soy bean paste based. Eating the ssam was a mess but a good mess! Sauce dripping everywhere, hands messy so try to eat that thing in one bite.  The turbot was massive and was delicate and flakey. The red pepper sauce complimented the grilled fish perfectly (although it can be pretty overpowering - so you might not want smother it all over and remove some before eating). Now if you happen to order ssam and the turbot as we did, I highly recommend eating the turbot as a ssam as it was phenomenal. But if you don't like fish..then don't try this."}
{"text":"Warden & Lawrence... Who would've known that Warden & Lawrence would be home to the best Korean restaurant I've been to in quite some time?   Dining in on a Sunday afternoon, I was quick to notice the simple but well-executed wooden interior. The restaurant was totally full - always a good sign. We were quickly seated and given a serving of hot tea as we decided on what to order. Like other Korean restaurants, you're given a set of banchan (side dishes) to eat as you wait. My favourites were the potato and the eggplant, but I assure you, there will be something for everyone. Note that you CAN ask for extra banchan (enjoy!).   Our table had pretty much all the staples covered - pork bone soup, chicken cutlet, and spicy pork on rice.   The pork bone soup was very flavourful and a little bit on the spicier side. Definitely not watered down. The meat was soft and tender. According to my friend, it pretty much fell off the bone, which is awesome for a dish as bone-heavy as pork bone soup  is.   The spicy pork was simply a well done iteration of the traditional Korean saucy and spicy rice dishes - just solid.   Lastly, my dish - the chicken cutlet. The cutlet itself was quite large, and fried golden brown with blackened edges that provided the perfect amount of crispness. Accompanying the cutlet was the traditional Korean purple rice (yum), and a small salad (meh). While the salad was just passable, the cutlet and rice combo was just delicious.   Regarding service, I have to give them a high rating because they were quite quick on all our requests, even though the restaurant was quite busy. They also didn't mind us sitting for nearly 2 hours after we had finished our meal, just to have a conversation.  Overall, Makkal Chon is as solid as it gets when it comes to Korean food. Definitely worth a visit. One thing I wanted to try but didn't get a chance to was their vegetable wraps! Check out the numerous pictures on this page, they look great.  #ReviewNumber100!"}
{"text":"This food here is simply fantastic. First off the banchan (side dishes) are amazing, probably the best I've had anywhere and their kimchi is the star! I order the Gamjatang almost everytime I'm here and it never disappoints. The pork is fall off the bone and the soup is rich, hearty and full of flavor. They mix purple rice into their steamed rice which is a nice touch. I've also had Bibimbap here once and it was very good.  While I haven't ordered it, the ssam (lettuce wraps) seem to be very popular and look very good. Will definitely need to try this some day.  The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is b/c of the decor and service. The decor could use some refreshing as it feels a bit aged. The staff are very friendly and helpful, but every time I've been here there is only one person doing cash and waiting all tables. So expect service to be a bit slow and it's common to see uncleared tables  Regardless, I will keep coming back..."}
{"text":"Lots of yummy appetizers. Pork bone soup is wonderful.  Purple rice tastes quite interesting and aroma is perfect. (sushi rice + black rice = purple rice according to one of the food servers. Bulgogi, Kalbi are also recommended. Reasonable price. Great staff.  May be good to call in and reserve in case you are coming during busy hours (lunch or dinner weekends)"}
{"text":"This place is soooooooooooo yum!! One downside is just the wait for food given its probably a family run restaurant. We had kimchi stew (5 stars), soft tofu stew and a mackerel wrap. We waited for about 45mins for our food but it's worth it!!! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious Korean food for a fair price. And it doesn't hurt that I live close by. Can't go wrong with the pork bone soup!"}
{"text":"OMG this place is so busy!! And I know why because the food here is good and there isn't any good Korean restaurants in this area. They give you more side dishes, including japchae and teokkbokki, than most Korean places in GTA. But their side dishes are not that authentic except for a couple of them such as stir-fried seaweed and kimchi. Moving on to main dishes, my boyfriend and I got Kalbitang aka beef short rib soup and bulgogi on the sizzling pan. Kalbitang had a generous amount of meat and the broth was good. Bulgogi was solid, tender beef but a bit too oily. Again, a big portion for bulgogi as well.   Overall, this is def. one of the best Korean restaurants in GTA. We will be back here to try other dishes."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Korean restaurant. The sides are very tasty and unlimited. Every time I've dined at this restaurant, the sides have always been different which keeps things exciting. They're all delicious - my favourites are the jap chae, fish tofu strips and the eggplant. I usually order a pork bone soup along with a hot and spicy tofu soup with tofu and seafood. It's not over priced, unlike restaurants in the Yonge and Finch area. Definitely recommend this place, especially if you're looking for bang for buck, delicious Korean food. Also, sometimes it gets a little busy at dinner but I've never had to wait more than 15 mins."}
{"text":"The best Korean restaurant I've ever had. We came here for dinner and I'm glad we got here before 5:30, coz it would be very full in the restaurant! The side dishes are amazing! I ordered #7 the soybean soup with beef brisket. It was very delicious!! Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"4 stars for the taste and presentation of food! As other reviewers have mentioned tho, cleanliness and service are shortcomings. There was only 1 waiter during lunch time and all our dishes came out really slowly. The tables and chairs were not that clean either and I had to switch a few times.  That being said, the side dishes are bomb and it's the first restaurant that I've been to that includes dukbukki (but cold) and japchae as unlimited side dishes. The other apps were very tasty too. I had the pork bone soup which was rich in flavour and had good chunks of meat.  Would definitely come again, but probably not during busy times."}
{"text":"I'm moving to a new area so a few of my good friends wanted to take me out for dinner. They wanted me to choose the place; instead, I suggested a few places from my looong list of Yelp bookmarks and they chose Makkal Chon.   We arrived at around 5:45 pm on a Friday. There were no line ups so we were seated immediately. Complimentary hot tea was served, but they don't leave a pot for refills. When you ask for water,  you get a pitcher of water and you have to reuse your tea cups. No water glasses? Minus points for that.  WE ORDERED AND SHARED: - Spicy Pork Bone Soup - they give you a large metal bowl to put the bones in. It comes with purple rice, plus points here. Not much meat left on the bones compared to other places.  - Teriyaki Chicken which comes with purple rice - decent but oily. - Mixed Spicy Soft Tofu soup with seafood, beef and pork in a hot pot topped with a raw egg. Strong fish taste. - Dol Sot Bi Bim Bab - crunchy veggies, flavorful mushrooms, marinated (ground) beef, on top of purple rice topped with an fried egg. It comes with miso soup. Lots of different textures going on here; it was tasty. - Bulgogi - tasted boiled meh.   Complimentary, refillable banchan (side  dishes) which changes occasionally. My favorites were the eggplant and crunchy thin beans.   We had three different servers helping us, sometimes we had to wave them over; but otherwise, they were helpful and friendly.  I personally wouldn't choose to eat here since I've had better food at cheaper prices elsewhere. My friends love it here though, to each his own."}
{"text":"My go to Korean food in Scarborough. Heck probably one of the best you'll ever have in Toronto.  Not once have I gone for dinner and made it through dinner without a queue forming but don't be discouraged, the wait is typically not long.   The notable dish has got to be the pork bone soup is probably top 3 I've ever had in the world and I've had pork bone soup in Seoul. They pile up sooo many bones with the soup (3-4 huge pieces) and everything in the soup is so flavourful. From the veggies to the potatoes to the pork and the broth.  The lettuce wraps and bulgolgi are also very good. The portions for everything is huge so prepare to fill your belly with yummy goodness  I've even forgotten my watch here and the owners were nice enough to keep it for me.   I've noticed that they attract a lot of Korean customers young and old which makes me think that this place has to be authentic.  As for the service, it has improved dramatically in the last year in a bit. They've hired more and better English servers. It's a lot faster than it used to be.  I have cravings for this place every time I'm in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Came here for round 2 after an unsatisfied dinner nearby.  Generous small apps were served almost immediately. We weren't given water until we asked, but that was ok. Our pork bone soup came quickly and we devoured it happily.   Downside to this place is the unfriendly restaurant owner at the end of the plaza who actually came in asking the person who parked in front of his place to move the car. The reason was, the owner said a truck was coming to drop off supplies. To drop off supplies at 9pm? Alrighty. Just be aware of where you park, you never know if these tenants will scratch your cars for \"taking up their parking spots.\""}
{"text":"Good flavors, ample selection of side dishes that come with each main order. Came here a while back and got the chicken cutlet. Overall, it's a nice small homely restaurant that offers good food and gets somewhat packed around lunch time."}
{"text":"Will update when i get home. But for now, the sides are amazing, service is great, but unfortunately lots of traffic xD  edit: Alright, home is where I am.  This place is somewhat hard to find if we lived in an age where there isn't GPS. But this place lived up to its reviews and I think this is one of the best Korean restaurants in the area for the masses.   If you plan on coming here with anything larger than a group of 2 for a weekend meal at a prime time, seriously consider making a reservation. The 2 times I tried to come here, it was full and we had to go elsewhere as we had to wait for an hour for just a table for 4. However, if you have some time to spare and you are hungry, it's definitely worth the wait.   The inside of the restaurant is sort of small as it can't host too many people. At most it was about ~50 ish. So, it gets filled up fairly quickly. It's a typical korean restaurant and their prices are on par, or slightly higher (a few bucks more) than the ones in markham, but the quality of their dishes are better and the quantity is slightly more. It's also worth mentioning that their side dishes are miles better.   The sides that they included were: honeyed potatoes, eggplant (apparently, they reached a deity-level), kimchi, glass noodles (jap chae), spicy rice cakes (!!), seaweed, and some mashed potato thing.   Price: 5/5 (A few bucks more, but the sides more than made up for the difference in price) Service: 4/5 (Great service and the waitresses on the floor knew what they were doing, but the waittt to sit was quite a bit) Food: 5/5 Price Point: 5/5"}
{"text":"The combo A is a staple for me and my mom. We've been coming here for years!  (and that means something coz my mom is a seriously picky korean lady when it comes to her food!). I go here every time i am in town and it is hands down my favorite Korean restaurant in the city.  The banchan are always fresh and tasty.  Their waitstaff are always courteous and friendly. I have never had a bad meal here plus its super affordable."}
{"text":"Im so glad we checked yelp when we were looking for a restaurant in Scarborough area. We found Makkal Chon and we were not disappointed. We had the spicy pork and a pork bone soup. There was plenty of food and we even had to take home. The pork bone soup, I will definitely come back for. The meat was so tender and falling off the bone and so much different spices and flavours. It was perfect with the purple rice which was delicious too. I'm dreaming about it now! This is a small place but we arrived before 5pm so we were able to get a table no problem. However, once 5:30 hit, there were line ups and lots of people doing take out. That's a testament of how good this place is. Highly recommended, all the dishes that came out of the kitchen looked fantastic. I have to come back!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, and super satisfying when you've been craving korean food. It helps that this place is one of the only korean restaurants in the area, as the location makes it super convenient when I want a quick fix.   To be honest, the menu is pretty small and some of the dishes my friends and I weren't very satisfied with. Stay away from plain bulgogi over rice - you get tired of it after a while. Also stay all from any of the stews if you can't handle spicy food.  I wouldn't say any of the food here is bad - but just average. The safest choice is to just get bibimbap, it's always good no matter where you go and luckily makkal chon is no exception.   One of the good things about this restaurant is the side dishes. The best side dishes they have are the ddeokbokki, japchae, eggplant and pumpkin sides. These side dishes are absolutely delicious!!!!  I have to admit though that the side dishes at makkal chon are either a hit or a miss. Sometimes I come here and the sides are delicious, but sometimes they taste pretty disgusting. Once they served my friend and I three different vegetable side dishes that were all bitter and fishy, yuck!!   TLDR; decent korean food"}
{"text":"It's interesting to see a Korean restaurant in this area, because there aren't many around here. That's smart, because of less competition, as they seem to always have lineups during lunch and dinner hours.  I always get their pork bone soup or pork cutlet on rice. I think they use A1 sauce on their cutlet. Just a heads up, because people either love or hate A1 sauce. They give you a wide selection of side dishes, which are discernibly higher in quality than that of other Korean restaurants. These are included with your meal. Come with at least one person to dine with, and you get significantly more side dishes!   Come here if you aren't in a hurry to get somewhere after because, again, there may be lineups... and their services is slower than average. It pains me to say that, because I love this restaurant and their friendly staff. They need to consider adding one extra wait staff to their service.  Pretty good number of free parking spaces in the plaza. They are next to a P.A.T. Korean supermarket, so drop by there after to get some Korean snacks and ramen."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday for dinner and it was super packed. The place is really small to begin with so we ended up waiting about 20 minutes to get seated. I really love korean food but as a pescatarian, I found that there weren't many options compared to other korean places I've been to. I ended up ordering a spicy seafood/tofu stew in hotpot and mushrooms on rice. I really liked the stew and you can adjust how spicy you want it which is nice. That being said, as I kept eating it I noticed there was beef in it as well. I didn't feel like asking for another one since it would have taken a while and I managed to get most of the big chunks out anyway. Also, the stew came with rice on the side which I didn't realize. The mushroom on rice was nothing special, literally just a stir fry of mushrooms/veggies. Probably wouldn't come back here as there weren't many options for me, but my dad ordered a pork dish with rice and he said he liked it (plus the serving size was huge). Even the people waiting behind us in the line said the food is amazing, so if you're not a veg/pesc you'll probably enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 2.5/5 (home run, cozy) Price: slightly pricier than other Korean restaurants Food: 3.5/5 What we ordered:  1. Pork bone soup - according to my bf, one of his new top go to. Good broth, served with purple rice 7.99  2. Bulgogi rice- well marinated, also served with rice 9.99  Service is typically a little slow, 1 server for the entire restaurant. But she's pretty quick. It's so close to home, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I would peg this place at 4.5 stars but Yelp wouldn't let me. Reason for taking away half a star is for the level of saltiness, a level even I struggle to cope with at times.  This was a unique Korean food experience indeed; no quite as unique as the time I ate live octopus and something called a sea penis (yes! it's true!). Lettuce wraps? Who would of thought! Genius! Actually, it's more like mixed vegetables wrap as you do a pile of almost seemingly random stuff like cabbage, kale, lettuce, some wilted stuff that looks like leftovers from the last patrons meal (tastes great though! LOL). So yeah in short, order it cuz it's pretty darn good.  Pork bone soup is a Korean staple and they've done it with justice. It's hot, salty, porky and spicy! It's a bonus that the meat falls off the bone so I don't have to look like a savage while eating it. One of the most flavourful pork bone soups I have ever had -- also expensive at about $10 a pop,  I will return and next time I a going to ask for a jug of water/tea. But when it's all said and done, it's definitely one of the best Korean places I have had the pleasure to dine at in the GTA."}
{"text":"Great food.  Attention to details.  The banchai were delicious, especially the marinated eggplant.  I could eat that all day.  Prices seem a bit high at first, before all the food arrives.  They give 6 banchai and seemed to use better ingredients on average than typical restaurants.  Everything tasted clean and made with pride.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's small but really nice and cozy. Always had great food and always really friendly. Not the ideal place for a huge group but 4 people should be fine. Only one time did I not enjoy the pork but other than that it was great. Also if your looking for BBQ/ self grilling than you should probably go to ktown. If you live in Scarborough then you will love this place. It turned me into a regular :)"}
{"text":"food ok, service is bad, no courtesy at all specially the lady with the long hair"}
{"text":"I think I had too much expectation about this place cause my friend told me it's so good. But food wasn't very identical. It tasted like any Asian food. And we had our food received like 40mins after we ordered. But the waitress didn't say anything or apologize. Food was average and their ssam combo might be the best thing to order. But they charge another $5 for ssam vegetable plate after the first free ssam vegetable plate but even you pay for another $5 dollar you still get the exact same quality ssam plate as the free one. That was pretty upsetting."}
{"text":"great place for korean food.  staff members are fast and efficient.  washrooms are clean.  place is kind of small.  it can get a bit stuffy when it's busy and the kitchen door is open so that the smells of the kitchen comes inside the eating area.  the place is small.  there are about ten tables or so.  the food is pretty damn good.  a bit pricey in my opinion but hey, we won't eat out here all the time.  i had the single serving of pork bone soup and the vegetables roll.  trust me, this is enough food for two persons!!!!    i will defo come back here to try out the other items on the menu.    they do not take reservations on fridays, saturdays and sundays.    btw, there is a korean supermarket a few doors down.  handy when you want some fruits and stuff."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always try and make time to stop in when I'm passing through the area. You will have to wait in line however. Item #40 the grilled turbot is unreal and they have some good beer/food deals.You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We went to this Korean restaurant since it was close by. We've had our share of Korean restaurants from Yonge / Finch to Bloor / Bathurst and even Chinatown so feel like we know a good place when we see it.  I ordered the usual gamjatang and my wife ordered some beef stew. The apps came first and they were pretty good. A little bit more finessed (e.g. garnished with sesame seed) than the typical Korean resto. The pork bone soup was flavourful, not overly spicy. The beef stew was light, hint of beef flavor (Korean stew flavours aren't usually a rich, thick broth).  Prices are a little above average, $10 for gamjatang, but it was a pretty good place and I would come back knowing that I'll be served a good quality meal."}
{"text":"This used to be a pretty good place both for eating in and takeout. However, sometimes they are so cheap with the portions it hardly looks like a full dish. Also, they are one of the few Korean restaurant that charge for extra side dish, which is quite untraditional. The takeout I got today really opened my eyes to how cheap they really are sometimes. There's only one table of customer so it's not even because they're busy. I got two main dishes and for side dish, they gave only TWO pieces of eggplant and 5 pieces of kimchi. Really? It looks like someone's leftovers. The main course portion also looks like it's significantly less than a year ago. I've always tipped for their takeout but I'm definitely not doing that anymore! Overall, each time I visit this place, I become more disappointed."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and really enjoyed the delicious and authentic Korean meal. Their service was also very prompt and friendly. Located near Warden and Lawrence, there is ample parking. The restaurant is cozy and taking the advice of other Yelpers, I decided to head there early with my family. Now to the food, their flavours are delicious and they seem authentic. There was a lot of care in the presentation of the food which had fresh  ingredients and provided you with a generous portion. The seasoning in the various broths ( my sister ordered a dish with chicken broth) was very flavourful. They provide many appetizers including rice cakes, seaweed salad and eggplant which I thought was a bit different but I enjoyed. I ordered their pork bone soup, having tried many others, this was my favourite. The meat was tender and fall off the bone. The prices are a tad higher than other places but the flavours are there and definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice. Unfortunately we waited for a while to get our appetizers which were very good. The food was good. The service was not amazing : no water offered to us, no tea refill offered neither. Not much attention from the waitresses who were still nice."}
{"text":"Makkal chon is located in a small plaza in Scarborough. I have to say this in my opinion is the top Korean restaurant in Scarborough and one of the top five in Toronto. This is my 2nd time, maybe third time visiting. I enjoy every visit and looking forward to going again.  I order the pork bone soup less spice and it came out perfectly just the way I wanted. The pork bone soup here taste different then other restaurants,  i prefer their version. My friend she got the tofu soup with tuna less spice. Usually people get tofu soup with beef or pork tuna works. It was a bit spicy not sure If they remember less spice. But I have to say the sides that come with the meal are the best sides I have had at any Korean restaurant. Every single side dish was so good and amazing, you swear you had to paid extra as they could be under apps and you still order it.  Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I love the Bibimbap ang their Pork Bone Soup, will definitely  come back and try another dishes"}
{"text":"Fantastic Korean food in Scarborough?!  Believe it!  I don't know what Makkal Chon is doing in the depths of hell that is known as Lawrence Avenue East but it is a shining beacon of amazingly prepared Korean food.  It's not just that everything is so delicious but it's just so impressive the amount of care and thought that has gone into the menu for a restaurant that possibly might never be found.  Case in point,  it's obvious the chef here really wanted to make a statement about providing a super healthy alternative to your standard Korean barbeque.  Besides the standard Red Curl lettuce you usually get with \"Sahm- lettuce cups\", she goes one step further and brings out an unconventional bounty of different greens like chicory and radicchio and other vegetables either served fresh or slightly steamed,  I mean, she even included  a delicately seasoned serving of  perilla leaves.   And everything is beautifully prepared and served from the delicious and unique pahn chan choices to their perfectly assembled mains.  Quality and attentiveness in every bite.  Their dwenjang and chung guk chang is super clean yet full of flavour and gets a big thumbs up from my hyper critical moms.  Definitely, one my fav Korean joints in Toronto."}
{"text":"I'll admit that I'm not a fan of Korean food. However, I will say that the food here is of good quality. I got the second menu item which was a spicy seafood tofu hotpot (can't remember the exact title). I enjoyed the little side dishes that most Korean places have, especially one that was a sweet noodle dish. The entreé was a good portion for the price. It was a deep bowl of seafood soup. Mixing the soup and rice together was very yummy. Very filling. However, in my opinion, there was too much tofu in comparison to the seafood. I wasn't even able to finish all the tofu. If you're a fan of Korean food then this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Need to wait for table during dinner time, cause the place is small, but the food is awesome.  I really like their vegetable wraps combo, with two dishes, and pork bone soup.  Prefect portions for two people, grilled pork and bulgogi are my favourite  Side dishes are great and yummy.  Also tried rice dishes during lunch time a couple times.  The food is good, but I still prefer vegetable wraps :-D   So I prefer to come here during dinner time!"}
{"text":"I came here with my friends because of all the Yelp reviews. First off, I thought it was easy to find - it's right next to PAT. So get your groceries done then go eat? (Or vice versa).   I ordered the ox tail soup. It's what I typically order at Korean restaurants. Why? Because it's delicious! Try it next time. It's  tasty! I was sad to not see any clear noodles in my soup. I don't know if it's \"supposed\" to be in there, but in previous Korean restaurants, they all had it in the soups. It's chewy and yummy so I wish they would add it one day! They gave us 6? Or was it 7 side dishes...which were also delicious.   Aside from the food, the restaurant seems small because it's so busy. (Or maybe it is small). There was a line up almost out the door. We were sitting near the entrance so we had people nearly hovering over us, which was an unpleasant experience.   I will still go back to eat your food because it's delicious."}
{"text":"A real hidden gem. Service is great and atmosphere is quite cozy. Real Korean servers too!"}
{"text":"This is the ONLY Korean restaurant that I would want to order a pork bone soup. In my opinion, hands down this is the best pork bone soup I ever had in the GTA. The location for the restaurant itself is kinda odd but it's always busy, even on weekdays!  I don't know what's their secret recipe but the soup taste much more flavourful than  other korean places. My boyfriend and I think its the blend of spices that they used to prepare the soup which makes it taste a lot more seasoned and rich - we don't think it's extra msg since you don't get that dire thirst afterwards. The soup is also on the spicier side which I enjoyed very much. You can see actual chilies in the soup!   Their side dishes are also worth mentioning, you can tell that they put real efforts in preparing them. I found the eggplants to be the best as we always ask for multiple refills on that.   The restaurant offers many other food options as well but we just can't find rooms in our stomach to try them as every time we come here we just want their pork bone soup.   Definitely would recommend to anyone who wants a good pork bone soup!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Went here for lunch and I told the waiter I was in a rush to get back to work. I waited about 15 mins for my food, which I think is reasonable.   Everything was fresh and delicious. The banchan were so good and varied - there was a grilled eggplant, sesame glass noodles, something like a sliced fish cake?, green beans and a couple others. Each item tasted different but all so yummy, and nicely presented!  I had the bulgogi with rice for my main - this was a very large portion and I ended up taking half of it home for dinner. Total for lunch with tax and tip was $16.   I will definitely be back here. Great place!"}
{"text":"I just don't get what all the hype for this place is about.  I've eaten here countless times, not because I've been so eager to try more of their food but for the sheer convenience of being located right next to the PAT East mart.    Whenever I came shopping at the PATmart with my mom, we would stop in for a quick meal after shopping.  Well, the quick meal is never so quick here as other reviewers have already mentioned but the wait time here is ridiculous.  I know some people suggest that's because they actually make everything to order which is not the case here.    I've tried pretty well most of the menu and none of what I've had there is a real standout.  Maybe my standards are just set too high having grown up with so much good food in our house.  I tend not to be too impressed whenever I eat out at any Korean restaurants.    What kills me is the quality of their kimchi.  No decent Korean restaurant operates without kimchi at various stages of fermentation, especially if you're offering kimchi-jjim on the menu.  I would say they've brought out under-fermented kimchi (which I don't mind but I'd rather have the properly soured version any day) almost every time I've dined here.  When I asked them about it one time, they simply said, \"that's how all our kimchi is.\"  Umm...no.  If you're cooking kimchi jjim, you need to have some very well fermented kimchi for the dish.  If they don't have one to offer to their patrons, where are they getting their kimchi for the kimchi-jiim?    Anyways, I'm still on the lookout for a good Korean joint in the GTA and I have yet to find one that is note-worthy."}
{"text":"I've been back several times since my first visit and review last July.   Makkal Chon remains at the very top of my Scarborough Korean list -- and the quality has been utterly consistent.  Stopped by today with an out of town food friend, and we ordered a single dish -- the BBQ eel on a hot plate.  This is ethereal.  With the multiple sides that come with it, it's a splendid small meal in itself.   Service was top notch too, friendly and efficient even though they were pretty crowded."}
{"text":"Got the combo A vegetable wrap with marinated beef and spicy pork. This is not the grill it yourself style Korean BBQ but prepared by the kitchen like regular restaurants. The meat had similar quality to the ones found in Japanese bento box. The combination with the spicy pork made the flavors very appetizing with sweetness from the marinated beef and spiciness from the pork. There were a large variety of fresh veggies to wrap your meat with. A good variety of side dishes but I wish they had my favorite (soya beans). Food was excellent but I would rather have the grill it yourself Korean BBQ with vegetable wrap at Sariwon Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Three Words: PORK BONE SOUP  Now that I've got your attention, this hidden little Korean Gem is one my favorite eatery's in the city. All the food is amazing, affordable and authentic. Every meal comes with a rotating variety of side dishes that offer an assortment of flavours and textures while your table waits for the main attractions to come out from the kitchen.  As far as the mains go, you can't go wrong with any of the selections, but my favorites have been the Pork Bone Soup, the Bi Bim Bap (complete with stone bowl) and the Bulgogi.   The only drawback to Makkal Chon is that it's a bit small and lines form regularly, so get ready to wait for a table. Just remember that here, it's always worth the wait and you'll never leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic food in a restaurant that has a super small footprint, so be prepared to wait.   Lots has been said about the main dishes, which are all good. They also serve some interesting side dishes that are less common, such as a sweet squash that is incredible.   The pricing in the liquor combos seems a bit off; not sure you actually save any money by ordering them."}
{"text":"First thing, don't come here unless you are ok with waiting an hour to sit and get your food. Granted I came on a Friday night around 6 pm. However, the servers are very kind and apologize for the wait. I've been here a couple times before and the things I've tried have been pretty good, nothing super amazing though. This time I got the bulgogi on rice. The beef was tender and flavourful. My boyfriend got the pork bone soup which he really liked.   Their side dishes are above average with a wide variety. My favourites are the sweet potato and eggplant.   I would recommend this place however don't go during prime times."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Korean food and was moping around when someone mentioned this place. I had never noticed it before tucked into a small plaza, with an unassuming sign. Basic decor and reasonable prices.  It was loosely full at lunch time and a 15 minute wait for my bulgogi with glass noodles which I took to go. What surprised me was that I got a number of sides with that, including a generous portion of rice. There were very few glass noodles and they were with a substantial amount of beef in broth. Tasty and good value I would say. I really wanted glass noodles the most so was slightly disappointed."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place 3.5 stars, only because the place could be cleaner and service could improve in terms of timeliness and friendliness.  Came here with a coworker for lunch and although there were only two other tables being served, the food service was very slow, even to serve the small side dishes.  The food is great and the small side dishes IMO better than most other Korean restaurants I have been to.  We ordered the pork bone soup and the bulgogi hot pot.  The prices are a bit more than typical Korean restaurants, but worth it due to the great flavours. I'd come here again, but I really hope they do something about the dirty tables, greasy chairs and service."}
{"text":"Run by Koreans means food is guaranteed authentic. The prices may seem a little more pricier but guaranteed worth it. You get a very good portion size for the amount you pay. I went with my mom and we got the chicken cutlet and beef bulgogi lettuce wrap set and it was so much food. But it was so worth it at the same time. The chicken cutlet came with purple rice, 3 slices of white meat chicken that was also cut into slices and salad. The bugogi lettuce wrap set came with a big bowl of lettuce, bulgogi, a bowl of purple rice, and a small soybean stew as well. Along with the meal we also got a wide range of side dishes as well which was great because at a lot of Korean restaurants I've been to, you only get a couple of side dishes. This is definitely a place to try especially when you see local Korean go to eat there as well"}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant, but it's worth the trip.   I've ate at this restaurant numerous times and  the side dishes have varied which is a good thing, as 50% of the time I get the Pork Bone soup, it's delicious.  Found myself getting creative one time and adding the soup and some sides to the purple rice.  Tasted great, and an example of how to play with food!!   You're there for the food, not the ambiance, but, it's family run and it has the mom & pop restaurant charm.  Guarantee  you leave satisfied and full, then turning around to look at the restaurant and surroundings taking a mental note for when you plan your next visit."}
{"text":"A friend wanted to try something new in the area, and browsing around Yelp led me to finding this place.  I ordered a DolSot BiBimBap and my friend ordered the Spicy Pork on Rice. Their flavours had this very authentic taste that many places seem to miss the mark on. It's a relatively small restaurant, and it will fill up really quickly. They give A LOT of side dishes and they're all real good. The food there tasted great, and was very fresh.  The only thing that bothered me a little was that ordering/food took a little longer even though we sat down before a few others. Though, some food may be easier/quicker to make and I understand that."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Definitely a go-to place for awesome Korean food.  We've been here four times now, and each time is as good as the last.  Our favourite?  The vegetable wrap for two.  Comes with two meat side dishes of your choice.  Its way too much food for two but we manage to finish it all.  The side dish appetizers?  They are all delicious and homemade.  Service is great.  Only downfall IMO. The restaurant is small, and if you order the dinner for two, it doesn't fit on the small \"for 2\" tables.  Make sure to ask for a larger table!!   And it can get busy here, so be prepared to line up."}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves a solid 5/5 rating. I've been visiting approximately twice a month in the past 3 years and they never disappoint. My favourites are their pork bone soup - their meat is tender and flavourful like no other ( make sure you indicate mild if you cannot take the heat, mild is spicy enough for me), and their grilled fish set meal. If dining with kids or anyone not into spicy food you can ask for the spicy sauce on the side.   The restaurant is small, seats about 30 people in total. Servers are all extremely friendly, but the service is not quick. So do not go if you are starving or in a hurry. Once you taste their food though, you will never compromise quality and never order Korean from the food court or at Owl of Minerva again...you will also agree with me that their food is so worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I would like to thank other Yelpers for helping me find this place!  I searched some good restaurants around the area of where my friend works to make it convenient for him and discovered this restaurant.  When I got there it looked much smaller than I expected.  It was located in a little plaza.  We all ordered some version of the lettuce wraps: teriyaki chicken, bulgogi and pork.  It was an experience like none other.  I absolutely love eating a large variety of things in one sitting and this was the perfect experience because unlike going to a buffet and pigging out, the meal seemed really healthy.  There was the side dishes of kim chi, seaweed, potatoes, bean sprouts etc. and then our meal came with brown rice (really nice texture), a tofu soup, our meat dish, 2 other side sauces and a huge variety of greens.  To be honest, I enjoyed eating the greens the best and I'm not normally a salad person.  In fact, the most interesting salad could not compare to this.  In the basket of greens there were boiled cabbage, chinese cabbage, bok choy, some pickled greens, curly lettuce leaves and more!  (Most of which was raw)  I was very surprised to taste the raw greens, they all had such distinct flavours that I never realized before because I always ate them boiled or satayed.  We put a bit of meat, soup, sauce and rice on the veggies and ate it that way.  I felt like I was spoiled with all the choices of stuff to eat and I couldn't believe how much I was enjoying my veggies.  The service was excellent as well.  Tea came frequent and I loved the little pill towels the waitress gave us.  She brought the little pills on a dish and poured water onto them in front of us.  The presentation of that was a bonus!  (I'm easily amused)."}
{"text":"Makkal Chon is one of my top restaurants in Toronto.  Service isn't always great, but honestly, I don't really care.  Every single dish I've had has impressed me so much. They are made with so much love and care and their ingredients are fresh and delicious.   Would recommend it for any Korean fans. A LOT more authentic than 99% of other places I've been."}
{"text":"My girlfriend found hair in her food twice at this restaurant. The first time was a month and a half ago in an order of kimchi fried rice. The waitress at the time took it back, apologized, and sent for a new order.   We decided to give the restaurant another chance tonight and the same thing happened. 3/4 into the meal, there was another hair peeking out from under the rice. No way it was hers because it was much shorter and a little curly (gross!). So I went to pay for the bill and told the waiter about the hair. He apologized but then said \"next time just check\". Great... because everytime you eat at a restaurant you should definitely check if there's hair in your food. Offered nothing else but his advice and a full-priced check. Never again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Korean places. You can tell they spend a bit of time on their side dishes and they are happy to offer you refills upon request. I love their veggie wrap combos. They offer a variety of fresh veggies that is perfect for wrapping the rice and meat of your choice. I usually get something spicy like the squid or chicken to balance the fresh veggies. Their service for the most part is great, polite and tentative. Only complaint I have with this place is their speed. They can take a while, even if its a simple pork soup can take 20-25 minutes. So if you are in a hurry, this might not be the place for you."}
{"text":"Wow! Best Pork Bone Soup ever. The seasoning in the pork bone soup is intense. Bold, flavourful and rich, this is one of the best Port Bone Soup I've eaten in Canada. However, the ginseng soup was only on par, wasn't too special.  This restaurant is small in size so be expected to wait if you are coming during a busy time but it's worth the wait. The atmosphere and ambience fits an authentic restaurant, and servers were busy yet respectful.  The appetizers were tasty! They had a total of about 7 appetizer dishes which was plenty. We enjoyed the sweet potato and eggplant appetizer the most."}
{"text":"Yelp is a great place to find some awesome foodie gems in plazas that I would never ever venture in.    Located in the most unassuming plaza is Makkal Chon, an authentic delicious Korean restaurant serving some really good Korean grub.  The restaurant is small and usually packed during dinner rush so expect to wait a bit if you find yourself here during the food rush.  Combo A wrap combo is a great option at $30 and comes with a choice of 2 meats (we chose bulgogi and the spicy pork and squid), veggie wraps, tofu stew, purple rice and of course a wicked selection of banchan!  This is enough for 2 but wanted to try the pork bone soup as well, so ended up over eating as everything was so good.  The spicy pork and squid meat dish was outstanding.  There was one banchan that had squash drizzled in honey and crushed peanuts which was the bomb!  Service was quick as all the food came out in less then 15 mins.  Staff were very friendly as well which is always a huge plus in Asian restaurants;)  I'm not sure what \"Makkal Chon\" means in Korean, but it's probably Korean for \"Freaking Good Food Baby\"!  Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had been fattening up from a month long of funemployment - he (not me) was in dire need of something lighter for his stomach. Tofu and kimchi stew should do the trick!   Our family and I were able to call ahead to reserve a table 30 mins before arriving. Highly recommended because Makkal Chon had non-stop influx of patrons on a week night and nearly every table occupied at all time!   Banchan - one of the weaker spreads I had in my recent memories. Nothing worth replenishing. I asked about the rice cakes - our adjacent tables had it but we were told that they don't have it that night.   Good thing we didn't overstuff ourselves with banchans. Their mains were huge in portion and so much tastier!   Combo Soon tofu - overfilled with the goods - one of the most generous servings of tofu and meat combo. Felt almost bottomless, so much to eating \"light\".   Pork bone stew - meaty, beautifully stewed, giant pork bones bubbling in a perfectly spiced broth. So well worth the wait!   Kimchi fried rice - made with chopped bacon and topped with fried egg. Thoroughly enjoyed every bite!   Pork tonkatsu - better than pork tonkatsu we had in specialized restaurant of Japan! So juicy yet crunchy - the tonkatsu sauce drizzle was just perfect. Couldn't believe for $11, two large, meaty, beautifully breaded pork tonkatsu were served. It even came with rice and side salad! We were beyond stuffed but we couldn't get enough!   Overall - Service - only two staffs running the entire front of the restaurant. Require some patience but for foods that are reasonably priced, very tasty, and huge in portion - Definitely worth the drive to give Makkal Chon a try!"}
{"text":"Hidden Korean gem in Scarborough. Amazing side dishes and the Mackerel is delicious. Family owned. Usually busy lunch and dinner time."}
{"text":"There always seems to be a massive wait whenever I come here, and I was never patient enough to wait. So one day I decided to drop by for a late lunch at an odd time. There were couple of empty tables around but we waited quite a bit for the servers to get around to seating us. It then took us some effort to get our server's attention to order because they were too busy near the counter/front desk chatting and giggling.  I ordered the Kim Chi Stew with pork, which was salty, unflavourful, and barely had any pork in the dish. I drank so much water that I went to the washroom twice during the meal. I'm sure those who visit Korean restaurants often know that out of all the little side dishes/plates that they serve in the beginning, at least one of them is mind blowing good. None of the side dishes were phenomenal.  Terribly slow and unattentive customer service, food was average, not sure what all the raves on here were about."}
{"text":"This should actually be a 4.5, as 5 is too high for just standard korean food but 4 is too low for the quality and service.  This is the second time I've been here and it's just as good as I remember from when I came a year ago. There is a large variety of sides, and not just the really basic ones (japchae, rice cakes, yams, beans, egg). The portions are also generous, and the quality of food is better than most places I've tried in koreatown and yonge and finch.  The service from both times I've gone is good, no bad experiences there. This would be my go-to safe bet Korean restaurant if it wasn't so far for me."}
{"text":"Was here Saturday night at around 6 or 7. Was busy but only waited for about 10-15 minutes. Got combo A for 2ppl with bulgogi (delicious) and spicy chicken (equally delicious). Had fun wrapping stuff into the different lettuces on the tray. Most impressive were the side dishes which are refillable. They were all good. The purple rice was so nice and fragrant. Only complaint was they never refilled our tea. And I asked for water but that never came. Didn't bother me enough to say anything. I was enjoying the food to much!  But places that are short staffed should just leave a pot of tea at the table.  Can't wait to return to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Went back there today.  It appears as though they are back on track quality of food wise.  However, no more little towels to wipe your hands (unfortunately).  The quality of the winter panchan was very good, the chonggukchang chigae was really, really good this afternoon.  Waitress remembered us (hopefully in a positive way) ... LOL.  They are back on track.  I was worried after the last experience!  This is a good place with refined, Korean cooking.  One of our regular go-to lunch spots. YUM!"}
{"text":"+ very flavourful food + wide variety of banchan appetizers - understaffed when I went in  Recommended Dish: Sizzling Spicy Chicken"}
{"text":"Food takes forever to come out. They also only serve the side dishes right before they serve the food, so be prepared to wait if you're really hungry. You might need some snacks with you. Pros is they give you a lot of side dishes and each side dish has a good quantity!   Food is decent, but not deserving of 4 stars. There are tons of other Korean restaurants with more flavour in their dishes. The pork bone soup here is really lacking in flavour. It just doesn't taste the same as other restaurant's pork bone soup. Would not return."}
{"text":"The side dishes here are the best in Scarborough, I asked for bibimbap without beef and they replace it with TOFU! It's my first time try tofu on bibimbap and its now became my FAV dish! The pork bone soup is pretty delish Their vegi wrap is high recommended  Service is friendly After dining here for more than 5 times, I now can make an conclusion that this place is the best Korean restaurant in Scarborough"}
{"text":"So after much research I decided to try this place out. Here's my review: the service was nowhere near as good as people mentioned.. I waited at the door for like 5 min until someone even acknowledged that I was there. Then as soon as I sat down someone came and asked if we were ready to order.. hadn't even opened the menus yet. The menu did have some rare options that you don't find everywhere such as the pork bone soup (I'll discuss that shortly) and many other Korean delicacies. As far as pricing goes I would say it was average (soup for 1 - 11$, short ribs for 2-32$, bulgogi beef hot pot - 15$). The meals come with rice and beans which was nice and also 7 tapas style appetizers (seaweed salad, kimchi, rice sticks in hot sauce, eggplant, chick peas, glass noodles and pickled palm). With respect to taste, the pork bone soup was very flavourful however I personally didn't like some of the spices used. The short ribs were really good (the order came with about 10). The bulgogi beef (which I thought would be the star of the show) was very tough and the hot pot itself lacked flavour. Overall, it was nothing special but I'm glad I tried something new."}
{"text":"The search for great Korean food let me here and I was not disappointed. The portions are great they give you a ton of side dishes and the prices are quite cheap. It is very busy/popular though, as we visited within 1 hour of opening and the place was full."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup was quite flavourful and was delicious with the rice. I feel that at 10.99 it is a little over priced.   The lettuce wrap came with a bowl of fresh vegetables, a small bowl of bean paste soup and a bowl of rice. The soup was a too salty for my taste so I had the pork bone soup instead to go with my rice. The beef was very delicious though! Some of the veggies still had a little soil residue.  Service was great at the beginning but as it got busy and we got our food, they weren't as attentive and it took us a while to get the bill."}
{"text":"Hot pork bone soup with rice.  What more could you ask for? The restaurant is not fancy but the food was great and the atmosphere is casual and easy."}
{"text":"Pros:  - The sides taste great and variety, more than most other Korean places - Great deal for the amount of food you get - The grilled pork Bossam wrap is bomb  Cons: - Seems to be understaffed during peak hours - Wait times can be a bit long  Ordered: - $29.99 Combo A: With spicy chicken and grilled pork - This deal is fantastic. For $30, you get two meat dishes, a soup, the leaf wraps (Bossam) and all the sides. This can serve 2-3 people and everything tastes great.  Conclusion: Makkal Chon is great. It's my go to place for when I am feeling Korean food. The food is fantastic and I'm always feeling full and satisfied after my meal. Like I said above, Combo A is definitely a go to and a recommended item to order. It feels light to eat with the wraps and there is a lot of variety of things you can try that can feed 2-3 people for only $30.   The only negative would be the lack of servers during peak hours but they hustle and work fast and diligently (I always order right when I get seated to avoid the wait though - hot tip!). I'd highly recommend Makkal Chon."}
{"text":"This has become our go to Korean food joint even though it's quite out of the way. Our go to dishes are the spicy pork bone soup which is out of this world with the perfect amount of spice, and a thick rich broth. It's the best I've had in town. Most other places I've tried, its more like a flavoured water than soup. Another must try are the vegetable wraps. Bibimbap is also solid. My only complaint is the wait times both to get a table and to get served. It's busy during peak meal times and they seem perpetually understaffed. So best time to go is during off hours!"}
{"text":"This is so far the best Korean place I've been too, there is a wait for the food during the busy hours but thats only because the place is quite small so it didn't bother me that much, there was a wide variety of side dishes we had 6 where most places I have gone to usually give me about 4. The purple rice is also a good change from the usual white I always get and it tastes so good paired with the dishes you receive. Workers are nice and service was good, would definitely come here again for my Korean food cravings"}
{"text":"Seriously, I would go here more often if it was closer to where I live.  their selection of banchan (side dish) is so much better in taste and quality compare to Korean restaurants in Christie and Bloor Korea town area. Also, I know that korean food has a lot of sodium, and sometimes when I eat korean restaurant food, I get so dehydrated because of so much sodium intake, but it seems like Makkal Chon tries to cut down sodium in their dish. Because of this, some Koreans would say that this place needs some more salt in their food, but I think it's just right."}
{"text":"Soup is really spicyy. They have lots of yummy side dishes but can only refill the Kim chi"}
{"text":"Great place for korean food in Scarborough. Service is a little slow but very cute, quaint place and servers are quite personable. I love how they set the korean appetizers in a stylish way on the table.  Been here twice, first time waited about 15 minutes, boyfriend got gamjatang (pork bone soup) and also kalbi beef (grilled marinated beef). Very good he said. Kalbi beef portion a lil on the smaller side but enough to satisfy a hungry stomach. I got the beef rib soup, it was ok, it's not very flavourful which I had envisioned. Oops. Second round was a few weeks later with the fam. This time I got pork cutlet. Great size and huge helping of korean salad, almost coleslaw-like. Delicious. Prices are between $7 -$35, expensive ones are things like dinner for two combo. My sister's korean ribs were $20.  Overall, clean decor, decent service, good food, nice location to satisfy scarborough korean cravings. Woo!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner and got the spicy pork rib that serves two. It was delicious! The ribs are nicely marinated and then cooked on that spicy broth. This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"Really great find in Scarbs. Super goood korean food! The banchan is bomb! So much variety! And the food is decently priced!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy that I finally got to try this place!   Cons - it's small and a little cramped. They also do not take reservations on Saturday evening, so you should be prepared to wait. We got there at about 7:30 and the wait was about 20-30 minutes. I think because it was so cold tonight, the restaurant was not as busy.   Pros - service was efficient and friendly, although they did not clear our dishes until the very end when everyone was finished their meal. They could clearly see our table was full (we ordered too much), so clearing it off would have helped.  We did stay past closing though, as did a few others, but there was no hovering over the tables or other subtle hints to get us to leave.   Now on to the food... yummy!  There was a good quantity of appetizers that we shared. I ordered the pork bone soup for $10.99 and it was delicious! The meat was so soft and tender.  Grilled pork and vegetable wraps were $15.99 and were a hit as well. Very flavourful and tasty. The bulgogi was yummy too, however a little too spicy for my tastes. I should've ordered non spicy bulgogi.    Overall, this was a great dining experience and I look forward to my next visit.  I can't wait to try the other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"What's not to love here? My go to place for pork bone soup. Their apps are great too before they serve you the entree. Quick service but not many tables. So you may have to wait during dinner hours."}
{"text":"it is famous for the vegetables wrap; you pick one kind of the meat, and it will come with tofu soup, and a tray of all sorted vegetables.   Banchan (side dishes) are very well-made as well. They have one of the best banchan in Toronto.  The only complain was the service was cold... I think it was pretty random because I saw the servers gave other tables water and banchan even they came and ordered after us..."}
{"text":"This is the only Korean restaurant I go to! I go here every week, even the waitress and waiters always know I never need a menu and knows what my fave side dish I always go for. They have the best pork bone soup, veggie wraps and chicken/pork cutlet.   Make sure you book a reservation or be prepared to wait in line. This hidden gem restaurant holds about 15 tables. The food here is always fresh and they do a good job at serving the food fast to you. My bf always get the chicken cutlet with the purple rice and salad with miso soul it comes with.  I always either get the veggie wraps or the pork bone soup.  I recommend getting the chicken/spicy chicken/bulgogi veggie wraps combo. It includes tofu soup as well."}
{"text":"Hollly YUMMM.. Thumbs up all around.. We ordered the pork bone soup (because everyone raves about it! And was not disappointed the bf LOVED it), spicy pork on rice and a veg soybean stew (note: they were super nice and modified this dish for me since I was a vegan! It was very delicious and hit the spot). I am definitely coming back here the next time we are in the east end!"}
{"text":"Makkal Chon is tucked away in an unassuming strip plaza in south Scarborough. The interior decor is a bit dated but pretty cozy, and there's not that much seating. In terms of food quality, Makkal Chon is likely the best authentic Korean restaurant in Scarborough. They have a wider variety of complimentary side dishes compared to other Korean restaurants in the GTA. The pork bone soup is perhaps the best I've ever had, with tender pork and rich and flavourful soup, on par if not better than more well-known establishments in Koreatown and North York. Their BBQ pork in lettuce wrap is also superb. All in all, I'd say it's a great place to check out if you're ever in the area or willing to make a trip down there to get some authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"Yuuuum.  This place is tucked into a little plaza but is honestly well worth the wait. The side dishes are so good and they're actually fresh!  The pork bone soup comes with a great deal with meat still on it for $10.99.  The downside is that it is a little pricier than other Korean restaurants but cost does match quality.    Overall .. will be back! :)"}
{"text":"people tend to say it's very hard for Korean food to be phenomenal, which I do agree but i must say i really enjoyed my dinner here on the weekend.  The side dishes here are amazing! I love the variety!! It's also very smart of them to serve different ones for each table - just noticing the different ones others got compared to mine made me want to come back next time to try the other ones. I've never been to a korean restaurant that serve 7 different side dishes, and yet still have a variety of others to offer.   Veggie wrap with spicy pork ($16) This was really good! I loved the assortment of the Veggies served - it wasn't just lettuce, but also kale and cooked cabbage as well. The spicy pork wasn't too spicy, and went really well with the Veggies. My favorite combo was using the lettuce as the lettuce crunch added a nice freshness to balance the spices.  The meal also came with a tofu soup which i would say did not taste good.  BBQ short ribs (Galbi) on a sizzling plate ($20.99) I must say it is quite expensive for galbi but it was well worth it. the meat was well flavored, tender and not super chewy like other places. The plate came with 9 big pieces, not with big fat pieces but all just pure meat which i liked.   Service was good - because it was packed we were seated by the front door but once a table opened they kindly moved us to the booths. The waiters and waitress were friendly and they were fast on serving you.  This place is like a hidden gem, I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"If you want home cooked Korean food! Eat here! Service is five stars. Be early there will always be a line. Will definitely come back here if I'm in Toronto!  Better than the bird!"}
{"text":"Warning : prepare to wait at least 30 mins for your food. That includes the side dishes...  What a strange location for a korean restaurant. Which makes this restaurant a hidden gem! Coming here on a Friday at 8:30pm, there was no line up but there  definitely was a full house. It was really cold standing by the waiting area to get seated. So in the winter time.. Make sure you dress warm!   We waited about 35 minutes or so for our veggie wrap combo. Grilled pork and bulgogi. It came with soup, rice, and a bunch of side dishes. The soup was a bit too salty in my opinion, but considered one of the better soups compared to other places. The bulgogi and grilled pork...OMG..heavenly.. So full of flavour, so delicious! There was plenty of veggies (so much we couldn't finish it all). The combo is definitely enough for 2.   It was a fun experience, but I prefer eating with utensils. Wraps were really good but it was too messy to eat and I didn't like using my hands to hold it. It'd be nice if they had anchovy wraps ..yum! (Saw it in a kdrama one time)"}
{"text":"New management. Seconds on side dish/banchan not allowed. Ran out of pork bone soup at 9pm?! Food is not the same. Me and my friends are not coming back. The hunt is on for a new fave korean place in Scarborough.  Bye Makkal Chon!"}
{"text":"Very tasty korean food. I like this place because every dish is perfectly seasoned unlike most places which are a bit too salty.  Portions are generous with a lot of side dishes. Although I cant say its the best, I would put this restaurant  top 5 korean restaurants  of the gta area.  Be prepared to wait around 30 to 40 mins on weekends during peak hours."}
{"text":"Delicious pork bone soup for $10.99. My friend got the udon soup - wouldn't recommend this as its too simple and bland.  Came with an assortment of side dishes as well. Ample parking space in the plaza. Staff were friendly.   Would definitely come back again. :)"}
{"text":"Makkal Chon was recommended by one of my Korean foodie who lives downtown and she said Makkal Chon was by far the best Korean food in the city! So it's been bookmarked on my to go list for a few years and I'm glad I dropped by to check it out.  Like most Korean restaurants, yummy side dishes are complimentary. But, what makes Makkal Chon stand out to me was the selection and the quality of these complimentary foods. Most joints don't offer such selection as they are not the main star of the show. You can tell their side dishes are made with love and care and not just straight out of the premade packages.  The pork bone soup was a bit on the oily side..  You can tell they just added chili oil to flavor but you can see a layer of chili oil just sitting ontop of the soup. The soup was also a tad over priced... 10.99$ for pork bone soup while average joint charges around 8$."}
{"text":"One day I drove by with my girlfriend looking for  a Japanese restaurant that went out of business...and we said ok let's be adventurous and try Makkal Chon! And we so glad we did!  The restaurant is family owned and runned so the service can be slow when the restaurant is full.  The appetizers are great! Every time are different.. and we can feed ourselves even on the appetizers alone.  My favourite here is the eel with rice, which I order every time....and then something different to try on the menu each time.  Can't wait to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"Gamjatang is not that impressive. They made it super spicy without even asking us how spicy we want our soup to be. My coworker and I were just so hungry we tried to not care anymore. What sold me is are the side dishes though. They have better side dishes than other places."}
{"text":"Fried rice with Kim Chi was too spicy for me so I would recommend you go with mild. The seating was tight, and as it was packed my girlfriend and I were seated beside the door, which was unfortunately not adequately isolated from the freezing outdoor. The pork bone soup was delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat! I tried a place like this in the Philippines and found one in scarborough! I would go back. Price is a little pricey but the amount of food served is worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious and well made, however it was pricer than some of its other korean counterparts. Good option for the area and the place had a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came in at around 7:30 PM on Thursday evening and it was surprisingly filled with people and had to wait for a short amount of time (10 minutes). This was a small restaurant that had traditional decor and was quite quaint in general - nothing outstanding.   We were served water and the menu was presented to us quite quickly after we were seated. We looked through the menu which had a lot of traditional Korean cuisine items - as well as Korean barbeque items paired with vegetable wraps and soybean stew. We decided to opt for a barbeque combo with spicy chicken and spicy pork - along with 2 rice, side dishes and one soybean stew for $29.99 total for two people.   It took probably approximately 20 minutes before we received our food. Of note, we did not receive the side dishes before our mains arrived. There were quite a few side dishes available and they were all quite tasty especially the lotus root dish. The pork was also very flavourful more so than the chicken but it was also pretty good - on par with other Korean restaurants, it's all the same sauce really. It's interesting that the vegetable wraps were not only lettuce it included some cabbage and other vegetable. The other vegetables didn't not complement the meat as well as the lettuce.  We received refills on all side dishes with no complaints from the servers. Overall this was a tasty meal for a total of $30 before tax and tips."}
{"text":"If you want yummy Korean food in scarborough then this is one of the places to check out.  It's not he typical Korean food but the quality of the food is awesome. They have these meat wrap you use lettuce and the favorites like bulgogi.  Also a tiny place so be there early cus it does get packed!"}
{"text":"My all time favourite Korean cuisine in the Scarborough area. Me and my boyfriend have been here at least 11 times in the past year and we can't get enough of it. Food is amazing (bulgogi in hot pot!) and the place feels very nice and cozy. Staff is really friendly but it can get a little busy sometimes. They offer a generous amount of appetizers with free refills. Would recommend this place to just about anybody craving Korean and looking for a place to eat!"}
{"text":"After reading my favorite Korean foodie aka Justine @foodigatorJ blog post here, I just have to try Makkal Chon out. Unlike most Korean restaurant located on Yonge or Bloor Street, this one is located in Scarbrough at Lawrence and Warden. Heard from a few other people that it's where a lot of Korean goes to for authentic Korean food, so I am confident that I will like it (^_^)  Got 7 side dishes   Wraps Combo A  ($25.99) ~ Basic Vegetable Wraps + Choice of 2 Meat Dishes ~ Choose between Bulgogi, Chicken Teriyaki, Spicy Chicken, Mackerel, Mackerel Pike, Spicy Pork, Grilled Pork and Spick Squid & Pork ~ Purple Rice & Soy Bean Soup (Daen Jang Jji Gae) ~ We decided on Bulgogi and Spicy Pork ~ Came with a assortment of veggies instead of just lettuce for you to wrap your meat with and I love all the different texture and flavor here (^_^) ~   Spicy Pork, love how it's not overly saucy nor too sweet like most other restaurant has it.  The balance of spicy and sweet is perfect here ;) ~ Bulgogi was tender and moist, perfect for those who can't eat spicy   ~ Purple Rice   Spicy Pork Bone Soup $8.99 ~On top of the combo, we order this since we wanted to try it out and we ask for extra spicy. ~ This was equally well made and love how they actually add hot chili to the soup instead of just adding extra chili powder on top like most places for my extra spicy request.  Verdict : ~Very affordable and definetly delicious. ~ We order way too much for the 2 of us, the wrap combo could have easily feed 3-4 people"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and I can't believe I've never reviewed it! I once ordered bibimbap here, but it's a little pricey for what you get. I started ordering the wrap combo for 2 with a friend and never looked back!   The side dishes are aplenty, you get authentic purple rice, the bulgogi and spicy pork are SO good with the extra sauces and some kimchi in a wrap! I love the bulgogi they make here, and everything is always super hot and sizzling when it arrives. For $30, it's a great deal when split between 2 people.  Service isn't the best here, but they get the job done. Except for that one time where a friend and I sat down and waited 15 minutes before just waving someone down to order. Since it's the only decent Korean place in the East end, I've found myself here quite a bit.  All in all, the food is really good - go for the wrap combo, it's the best deal! But if you want something like bibimbap or a stew, it does get overpriced fast so head a little more North and you'll find better food for better prices."}
{"text":"Went there last week, we had the chicken cutlet and spicy bulgogi.  the chicken cutlet is in the Japanese style -- salad, rice, two beautiful pieces of panko encrusted chicken katsu and it was amazingly good! Definitely getting this one again!  The spicy bulgogi was really savoury and goes well with rice.  I would say that the spicy bulgogi was too salty -- next time would order them to reduce the salt.  We had miso soup, Korean banchan side dishes, and ate everything on the table.  love this restaurant, always wanting to try something new each time I go."}
{"text":"SUMMARY:  One of the notably great things about this place is that each meal comes with at least 6 in-house made side dishes! This place is really out of the way for me but if I crave for pork bone soup that much, I definitely will think about having it at Makkal Chon because it was that good! The restaurant itself is small and pretty run down, so don't expect much. But I'm there for the food and the food definitely made me happy!     MY MEAL: Dish: Spicy Pork Bone Soup   Review: Best thing in the world to fill me up and keep me warm! It wasn't all that spicy  and for everyone that knows me, I can't handle that much spice to begin with but I still always try and for pork bone soup I would in a heartbeat! Always so messy to eat but always so goood!! My friend showed me this place and it's so great because it always comes with at least 6 house-made side dishes!"}
{"text":"Omg delish, portions are massive and so so tasty. Chicken cutlet the best I've ever had. Sides were great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food ok. Not great.   Service ok. So slow. Took 1/2h to get food out.  Spicy pork was bland. Bugolgi just ok.   Wouldnt be pressed to come back. GTA have a lot of places that are better."}
{"text":"Pork bone soup (Kam ja tang) is a must have here. In fact it's the only thing I order.  Service can be a bit slow or disorganized but it's still not bad enough to keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant, but we went early at 5:30 and were able to find a table easily. There were 3 waiters working one time making the service quicker than most Korean restaurants.   The menu had a good variety of food. We had a hard time choosing! Everything just sounded so good! The food came quickly and were delicious. The side dishes were spicier than I'm used to, but still so good. The rice wasn't normal plain white rice. Which I love, it's more nutricious.  The prices are decent. It's around the same price as most Korean restaurants I've been to.  By the time we left, it was busy. But the hard workers were still able to get to us in a reasonable time and complete the checkout."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night and had reservations, but still had to wait a bit for a table to be free. Nice small restaurant, and delicious food! Ordered the Dol Sot Bibimbap for myself and my boyfriend got the pork bone soup (very spicy!) Both dishes were tasty and very filling, would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Decided to try another Korean restaurant since  discovering my love for Korean food. My fiance and I decided to try out this place on a Friday. We got there around 5:30 pm and we got seated right away since the restaurant wasn't too busy, but I'd we had waited another 30 mins we probably would have ended up waiting for a table of 2. The place looked clean with young, friendly looking staff. I decided to order the pork bone soup since it was the most recommended by other Yelp users and also by a friend. I've had pork bone soup before that I really enjoyed from a different restaurant so I was going to base my experience on my last. My fiance ordered the bulgogi on rice. About 5 to 10 mins of ordering we were served with 7 different types of appetizers: kimchi, seaweed salad, eggplant just to name a few.  Our main dishes arrived about 10 mins after our appetizers and I would have to say the bulgogi was really flavourful. The beef was slightly sweet like Terriyaki. The pork bone soup +rice was good, but I would have to say I've had better. To me it tasted a bit watered down. Our bill came to be less than $40 for 2 dishes. I would  recommend this place to anyone looking for a great dine-in Korean food."}
