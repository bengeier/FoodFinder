{"text":"I agree with the review below.  I've been here 4-5 times and have always had great sushi.  The service is knowledgeable and can answer questions about the menu.  I must say I've never had a bad roll from here.     Love that it is BYOB  - saves some money on the drink side. The servers also do bottle service, which is great.   The ginger salad at this restaurant is my favorite I've had in Pittsburgh.  It's not like other salads that is full of spinach and ends up soggy by the time you're done with it because of the ginger dressing.    Also, the review below stated that it is owned by non-Japanese people   - I've only been waited on by Asian servers and have seen the cooks themselves - no white folks in the back!  I'm confused by the review below.  Love this restaurant and highly recommend it - worth the drive from the city!"}
{"text":"My husband I have been to Kotobuki so many times because the food is always great! especially their Sushi is the best in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I feel badly giving this place such a bad review (as it is clearly a family-run establishment) but honestly this is one of the worst sushi experiences I've had in awhile.  My boyfriend ordered a roll that had yellowtail in it and I tried a piece and it was clearly bad.  My yellowtail and scallion roll came later and it similarly tasted bad.  When I told the waiter he said he would bring out another roll with just opened fish but that was just as bad.  I would have preferred them to have just replaced it with another roll or credited us.    Even after telling him the new roll was bad they still charged us for the roll.  I also ordered the BR7...BAD IDEA.  This is allegedly Ben Roethlisberger's favorite roll (it's a crab nigiri roll).  Honestly I had one bite and couldn't eat any more of it.  Also, the sushi rice was exceptionally cold and hard.  The house salad was the poorest excuse I've seen for a salad...there was only iceberg lettuce (usually sushi restaurant house salads have some carrots and radishes in them) and it was lettuce from the very interior of the head, very white and even more tasteless than normal.  The dressing also had no \"meat\" to it like the normal ginger dressings from sushi restaurants.  I think this is another classic example of a sushi restaurant run by non-Japanese people who don't really know what they're doing."}
{"text":"To answer some \"which ethnicity runs this place\" I can tell you its owned by a nice Korean couple, and staffed by a mix of Koreans, Japanese and a few Caucasians. Why does that matter anyway?    Good food is good food, no matter who cooks it. I've had awesome Italian food cooked by Ecuadorians.  If you want total authenticity, go directly to Japan.  Just ask your favorite sushi/teppanyaki chef where he's from.  (Its probably not Japan)  //rant Anyway, I've been here a few times and its my \"special occasion\" restaurant because its not very close to me. I have yet to be served a bad meal. I love the Sukiyaki Hot Pot!  Its served in a huge cast iron crock and LOADED with noodles, veggies and meat in a wonderful rich broth. The last few times I've gone I got the Deluxe Bento Box.  It has a little bit of everything...the potato croquette is phenomenal. Tofu Age Dashi is a favorite appetizer of mine, thick blocks of battered tofu in a rich broth. My husband ALWAYS gets the Kimchee appetizer (hello! Korean!) And he loved that they added Bi Bim Bop (another Korean dish!) to the menu.  Bi Bim Bop is a dish with rice at the bottom of the bowl, then layers of marinated beef and stir fried veggies are added and topped with an egg.  Its fantasic at Kotobuki. If Kotobuki were closer to home I'd be there every week!"}
{"text":"I noticed that there was no review of this sushi place and though I haven't eaten here recently, this is one of my three favorite sushi places in Pittsburgh.  Its a bit of hike if you live in the city but  certainly worth the drive if you have been to Chaya and can't afford to frequent Umi  The place is run by koreans (as are almost all sushi restaurants in the US) and is not quite authentic but you can generally get good, fresh sushi here.  Since there is a great economy of scale in ordering sushi, everytime I have got a group together to make the hike, we order the large sushi/sashimi boat.  Last time I went, three of us feasted on this and were completely full with this alone.  Cost around $75 total.   Its hard to get enough at that price if you order a la carte.  To calibrate my review, whenever I am in Tokyo, I plan my hotel stay so that I can get over to the fish market (Tsukiji) very early in the morning (around 6:30 am) to sample the sushi at the restaurants around the perimeter."}
{"text":"i came here on a trip in 2008 and this place made me vow to never eat sushi in PA again."}
{"text":"I give Kotobuki about a 4.5...  I have been here tons of times, and also sampled some of the \"best\" sushi in PGH (Umi, etc.) and Kotobuki comes out high on the list.  The sushi is very good, nice presentation, friendly staff. BYOB is always a plus. My favorite roll is the Sunkist Roll. Get this one! It is a spicy salmon topped with very thinly sliced lemon slivers. It definitely has a kick to it, but the balance of lemon adds freshness. SO GOOD. I have never had a problem with the freshness or taste of any items on the menu.   Since they are under new management, they have a new menu, but still have some of their signature rolls from the previous menu. The veggie roll has definitely improved on the new menu!   One thing that makes me sad is that it is always super slow when i go... I think they get a lot of take-out orders, but it is also in a hidden spot so many people probably just don't know about it. I could see that being a turn-off when someone walks in and it's empty. I took my aunt there, and she was very skeptical that it wouldn't be good, fresh, etc. She had reservations of the quality of the place, but after we ate she took them back. She loved it!!   Love Kotobuki, but one small thing: the edamame is VERY salty. Most people like salty, but just a bit too much for my taste. It does come out hot though, which is good and some restaurants don't serve it hot enough!  That is all..."}
{"text":"It's certainly not in the most obvious location, but this BYOB sushi restaurant is worth finding out. Unlike some other reviewers, I've never had a bad experience with the food. Nor am I under the impression that the ownership is local. I've only ever been served by Japanese employees that were obviously not native English speakers. The food itself is delicious and fresh, though it's not the greatest sushi I've ever had. However, the prices are very reasonable. The ability to bring your own alcoholic beverages and not pay a cork fee is also a plus."}
