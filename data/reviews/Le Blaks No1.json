{"text":"Two words: delicious. Ok, one word. A little loud on a Saturday night, but we'll worth it. Good service, good food."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service, large portions, with better then decent sides. Go check it out."}
{"text":"I had heard lots of good things about Blaks but didnt hsbr time to done in.I went for takeout of 1/4 ribs and pulled pork combo and will go back soon.

Staff was very helpful and accommodating.

Potato's were awesome. Among the best I ever had freshly cooked.
I have a big green egg and the pork was the best I ever had. Ribs were very good, though I wish there was more in my serving.

Ambiance was very nice, nearly full on a Friday night.
Only advice I would have is have kid sized portions."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place but it really didnt live up to my expectations. It took over an hour to get our food and when we got it, it was average. The soft drinks were completely flat, the potatoes were cold and the cole slaw was awful. On the plus side, the ambiance was good, our waiter was nice, the deep fried onion was fun and the ribs were tasty. I guess its worth a try but avoid going on a busy night if you can."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this restaurant ever since it opened. They have made a few upgrades since but still need a little more. The food is always very good but sometimes not consistent in quality, they have increased the price of their entrées, it can get quite loud inside and tight in space because it is quite small inside. The pulled pork sandwich, ribs and chicken quesadilla are all very good and I definitely recommend trying those."}
{"text":"Just amazing,and the service is top notch truly amazing,I have never finished all of it burgers are fantastic,the ribs are awesome"}
{"text":"All I have to say is, I tried. 

The first time, your food was okay, but the atmosphere was great as well as the service. 
The second time, the food was better, but the service was terrible. 
Now tonight we went and had dinner, 2 of us, and will never be going back. I have never written a review for anything in my life, but this place is a joke. Rude, and full of excuses. Somehow it's my fault that my meal was terrible!? I've heard the owner is a bit of an ass but apparently the staff follows suit... Steer clear folks, go to st Anne de Bellevue, that's what we will be doing from now on..."}
{"text":"J'y suis retourné seul. La nourriture ne se démarque toujours pas. De plus, il n'y a pas de menu du midi."}
{"text":"Tried this place... Fried chicken is good and their rotisserie chicken is not bad, the Ribs which is supposed to be their specialty was horrible!! If you decide to go there, do not have the Ribs, they tasted like frozen ribs that were heated!"}
{"text":"Le restaurant est cache a l'île Perrot. Beaux plats présentés sur des planches de bois. De bons burgers et rondelles d'oignons. L'assiette de différents hors d'uvre  est superbe avec une bonne bière ou un verre. Toutes les viandes sont fumées sur place. Le stationnent est assez difficile. C'est un restaurant familial que toute la famille adorera. Le service est impeccable et amical."}
{"text":"I was extremely pleased with this place!

I am in no way a ribs connoisseur, but I can say this much: I never had better. They were, simply, delicious. The meat slides off the bones, the sauces are tasty, rich, and full of flavors. The fries were really good and crispy. The chicken was fantastic. Seriously, it was great, and even though some plates go up in price, they are well worth it. You do not leave this place hungry, that is for sure. I decided to order a fried Spanish onion as a starter thinking it was simply onion rings... omg, they actually brought an entire fried onion... and it was delicious. Just thinking about it makes me salivate. 

Seriously, the food is plentiful, flavorful, and original. This place a definite must.

The only thing, which is not a complaint in my case, but might become problematic, is the waiting time. I went there on a Monday afternoon and the place was deserted, yet somehow, it still took a longer time than expected. Friday nights must be hell, but I could be wrong.

The waiter was very friendly and answered our questions without any problem.

Overall, great place. Well worth taking a trip to."}
{"text":"Great food! Huge portions, except for little cheesecake 'shots', but that was perfect after the copious meal. I didn't have great luck with the steak, but we were offered free desserts, due to a tougher piece. All the pub choices were fabulous: quesadillas, burgers, ribs... Bring your appetite and take a reservation. I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The ribs are really good. They are so tender that when you pull the ribs apart, only the bones slide out. I will have to try the burgers next time because they looked so damn good."}
