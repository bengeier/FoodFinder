{"text":"I ordered through their online site and received a confirmation number and email for my order. The order never came. When I called to see where it was they said they didn't have it. This place sucks."}
{"text":"Great service and tasty pizza. Girl at the counter was very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Veggie pizza has best olives. Nice staff. We are in as we were visiting the city. Limited reviews on Yelp but supposedly the delivery site has reviews and they have 2123 likes on Facebook."}
{"text":"The best quick, inexpensive, quality restaurant on Blvd St Laurent.  I'm thrilled every time with their fries, always perfect.  Their poutine is just as it should be, excellent gravy.  Their spaghetti is excellent.  Both my husband and I love it as it tastes like the spaghetti we had growing up.  The pizza is excellent.  Their cheese is really good, and toppings always fresh.  I especially like the Hawaiian pizza, and the deluxe.  This is a family run business and is open super late.  Lots of specials.  I've been going since they opened and the food is consistently excellent every time.  The pita slovaki is also very good.  Don't just order pizza from the case, sit down and have a meal, this will become your St Laurent destination.  They want to make repeat customers, which in my mind is a solid move. Don't miss it!  Just south of Pine on East side of street."}
