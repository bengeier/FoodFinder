{"text":"I was Crushed when Tucchetti's Closed. I used to drive from Havasu just to get that outstanding Thin Crust Sausage Pizza & Chicken Parmesan.  My friend and I where known to the waitresses as the guys who order a large pizza as an appetizer. I loved that place so much I Just Bought an old Menu on eBay.  Turns out the long time Manager of Tucchetti's has opened:    Amici catering 1744 W. Bell Road (602) 866-1604  Too bad I just moved to Dallas."}
{"text":"Me, too, Nadia C, me too !!!!!!  Since hearing of the passing of Tucchetti's, I have been in mourning, and I no longer live in AZ.  I always figured that when I'd return to Phoenix/Scottsdale, I'd get back to Tucchetti's.  I LOVED THAT PLACE.  No one else has EVER EVER EVER even come close to making a minestrone as AWESOME as theirs.  Their salad with the creamy garlic dressing (and first place I ever tasted Roma tomatoes) was fresh, crisp and delicious.  Their garlic bread was some of the best I've ever eaten.  Hot entress were excellent, but I never ate them since I'd fill up on soup, salad and breadsticks.  Desserts were decadent.  WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE and why did it disappear so mysteriously????????????"}
{"text":"RIP  I really miss Tucchetti's, so much that I am reviewing a restaurant that is no longer.  They had the best soup and salad bar.  It was a fun family restaurant and a great date restaurant-- TELL ME WHERE do you find that? I dunno!   Bottom line, if you never got to eat at Tuchetti's you missed out. Tucchetti's is a Phoenix Legend."}
