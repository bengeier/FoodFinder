{"text":"Simply the best beef patties in the GTA. The perfect flaky outer crust, great beef flavour, and just enough heat. Reminds me of Ralph's pattie shop my dad used to take me to in 70's.  Well worth the drive to the mississauga/oakville border."}
{"text":"Nice little family run store I wish I found about earlier to hold my (rather awkward) beef patty cravings at bay. Your average patty I'd say (hey, out here in the west burbs we can't be patty-picky) but fits the bill!   Mental note to self (and other Yelpers): come back on the weekend to try their goat patties."}
{"text":"Jeanie's is a small, West Indian grocery store that sells homemade beef patties.  When I arrived in the early evening, the toaster out front was empty, but they still had patties available.  I'm not sure of the cost of a single patty, but half-a-dozen & a dozen were amazing prices, like a little over $1ea.  Half a dozen was $7 and you can mix and match flavours, no problem!  I was with a friend so she got 3 non-spicy while the rest were spicy beef for me!  Very good flavour and crust was flaky.  I was skeptical because the patties looked exactly like the frozen ones, but it was delicious.  They also had loaves of bread AND spice bun which looked and smelled delicious!"}
{"text":"Not much to say. I love patties, they didnt have any of the flavours advertised on a saturday evening even though the place was empty. Ended up w a box of beef mild patties. Did not like them at all. I found they had a weird taste to them. I prefer randys or tinnels for sure. They also didnt hve any cocobread. So we got peg bread instead always a great alternative.  We are stuck w a whole box that my bf is tired of after 3 and i dont like after a half of one.  Definitely will not be back, should hve bought one to try first."}
