{"text":"Worth the stop for some great Thai food! It's a small Thai restaurant located in Downtown Las Vegas, in the Arts District. 

The food has a lot of flavour. I went with the pad Thai and was not disappointed. The Thai tea tasted fresh.

Service was really fast, and I knew what to order since I love Thai food so everything was quick!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Thai. This restaurant was an unexpected gem for me. Credit for discovering it goes to my husband, as he tried it on lunch while working downtown one day. The menu isn't huge but it has some of my favorite classic dishes and the service was super fast. Staff: friendly, food: delicious, store: clean, prices: affordable.

We split the beef jerky, drunken noodles, crab rangoons, and a Thai iced tea. Even my 16-month old son was scarfing this food down! Thanks for the delicious experience, D E!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice. Quiet and peaceful. Small,cozy place. Boy and Tyler were welcoming and recommend great dishes. Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Coming from NYC the home of a thousand Thai restauranta, this place was awesome.  If you are craving Thai, you can't go wrong coming here.  Seating is limited, and they don't have beer yet.  I had the drunken noodles."}
{"text":"Good service and great food cant wait to come back they deliver too cant wait to eat here more often definitely mu new go to thai food joint"}
{"text":"Tried this new place by work today (in the old Rock N'oodle spot). Played it safe and got chicken Pad Thai. Very flavorful and yummy!!   Will for sure be back to try other menu items. The beef jerky looked very good!! 

Ok so i went back and had the yellow curry with chicken. SO DANG GOOD!!  JUST SAYING."}
{"text":"Thanks to a hungry wife and Yelp reviews we found this place. On, the server, was very pleasant. At first glance food seems like portion size was small. But it was very tasty I was not disappointed the combination had beef squid and shrimp. For the price it was definitely worth it recommended any time for lunch or quick dinner."}

{"text":"This place is really good!!! You should check it out, great prices. It's really small and quaint. They also do delivery. I'm coming back for sure !"}

{"text":"Really fresh and tasty!  They were on time and friendly. The food tasted clean and well prepared."}
{"text":"Very good fast friendly service. I got the pad Thai chicken . Spice level is 1-5. Take out portion was large - perfect experience overall :) very nice lunch spot downtown by courthouse - I'm sure it gets very busy during lunch hour so take out is best option because they don't have that large of a  seating area ."}
{"text":"Satay chicken was very well seasoned and the fries tofu was also delicious. Also very fair prices."}
{"text":"Had to try this new Thai place out since it's near by my work. The food is delicious and they were quick. I'm always on the go, so time is very sensitive to me. Their Thai tea was on point too. Not too sweet.. just perfect. It's a little place that's hard to find.. but I call it \"Diamond in the Rough\". Definitely will order from here again and again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, they are right near my house! Their red curry is absolutely incredible, and they have some great vegan and vegetarian options as well!"}
{"text":"The best thai food in town!! We've been there a couple of times and food and service have been excellent!!"}
{"text":"We had the chicken fried rice and the drunken noodles. The service was prompt and friendly, they made recommendations based on spice preferences! The food was flavorful and great portions! We enjoyed the food and it was very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Place is in the corner , nice spot came here today for the first time . The owner was very nice food was great . Came with my wife we got 3 orders. The pad Thai was delicious , lab salad was awesome , and the ginger pepper rice was also good..portion size was just enough to satisfy us.We got ourselves some Thai tea to go with this lunch meal . Keep up the good quality food and service ."}
{"text":"2nd favorite place for drunken noodle in Las Vegas area! 

Gluten friendly, and delicious! I can't wait to come back to try some of their other dishes. 

Great Service! You order at cash register not at your table! 

It is very small inside! If you want to come during busy time, maybe make reservation! 

It has a small parking lot on the side, and street parking.
Nice restroom."}
{"text":"I was visiting Vegas from the S.F. Bay Area and tried D E Thai Kitchen for dinner midweek.  I can say that this place is a gem, here's what was ordered:
Beef Jerky   B+  (not filet mignon, but sauce was absolutely amazing)
Basil Chicken A+ (Probably some of the best I've had, simple yet well done)
Yellow Curry with Shrimp  A (Shrimp were cooked just right)
Vegetarian Drunken Noodles B+  (Tofu was lacking, everything else excellent)

For Vegas, this is one of the few true Thai places that don't mix in other Asian influences.  Place only seats 14 people and most of the business that night was take out.  They serve on paper plates at the moment so sauces tend to meld together.  This place will only get better."}
{"text":"If only more one dollar sign restaurants consistently served food as good as D E Thai! There are a table and chairs, but the place is set up for takeout. Everything we got was freshly cooked and tasted very good (the Pad Thai was a bit sweet for my tastes), and the guys working there were really pleasant. Tourists should note that the place is a little off the beaten track. You might consider driving rather than walking there from Fremont St. after dark."}
{"text":"Great food with comfortable prices. Free Thai tea with yelp check in. Can't wait to get the best chicken wings in town."}
{"text":"Decent.  I got red curry and drunken noodles, slightly bland and not much meat.  But it is pretty cheap so that's good.  They just opened so maybe they will improve.  I would give 3.5 stars if I could.  I'll stick to Komol for a while and check back later to see if they've upped their game."}
{"text":"I ate there yesterday and it was wonderful. I had the veggie egg roll and the green curry. Will definitely come again when back in Vegas."}
{"text":"AUTHENTIC thai food!!, the flavors just like street food back home!!   FRIENDLY AND Knowledgeable staffs. I'm a chef so I know my food. Thai chefs in the kitchen Try anything from appertizers and Pad Thai is a must!!! Specialty items like Pad Gra Prow Crabmeat!! YOU WON't find it at other Thai places in town. BOAT NOODLES TOO. place is spotless , nice restroom. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"To me this place is the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas area. Their prices are surprisingly cheap for what they offer. I really can't say what is my favorite dish because most of them is really good to me. Try their Tom Kha, Pad Thai, Fried rice crab meat, Tom Yum Noodle... you will thank me for this review. Lol
Update: Right when I don't know what else to order from them, they came up with more dishes that as delicious as always. I recommend Drunken fried rice and Yen Ta Pho."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch delivery to my hotel got green curry soup ,Jazmin rice, and pad Thai Noddles. food was fresh warm and delicious showed up at exact ETA and prices are reasonable highly recommend for EDC WEEKEND .."}
{"text":"It was Worth the stop!  Is a very Small lil restaurant in downtown Las Vegas but the food was very good . I had the papaya salad and it was delishhhh!  I highly recommend this place. Definitely this will be our place when we come back to Vegas again."}
{"text":"Excellent food friendly service I wish I live closer so I can come to eat here more often:)"}
{"text":"My family and I are obsessed with this new DOWNTOWN find. The restaurant is still building it's notoriety but let me tell you, it won't take long until the city comes around. Located on 3rd and Charleston blocks from the Art District, this little but flavor packed Thai eatery is worth it! 

The service is great with friendly staff/chefs and the ordering process is quick and easy. Good for smaller groups or quick bite. We always have full bellies whenever we leave this place. Side note: If they offered frequent visit punch cards, we'd have a few lol

Whenever we go, I'd like to order their beef jerky (their sauce is DIVINE!) with sticky rice. We also like traditional Thai dishes so expect us feasting on Larb and Papaya Salad as well. So good! I'm a huge dessert fanatic so of course I always order coconut ice cream with roti -- *drool*"}
{"text":"Well worth the stop. Clean and authentic. Great fresh tasting. Attentive staff. Small and quaint with easy parking."}
{"text":"Cheap!  Prices are a throwback to the 80s with good portions.  Not  wanting to go back out in the heat we opted for delivery.  $3.99 for the service.

The $6 Chicken Wings were spicy.  You are asked how hot you want them on a scale of 1 to 10.  I said 12.  It was a tolerable heat still able to taste the sweet honey on a well cooked wing.  More like drummets, 9 pieces was a good amount.

The $8 Tom Khai was very nice.  Lemon grass with coconut milk is such a good combination.  The chicken, although flat, was not a pleasant chew as I've come to know this dish.  Still tasteful.  Good to pour over rice.

Vegetable $7 Pad  See Eiw did not taste like any other Pad See Eiw I've had before.  Maybe  because this was the 1st time I've ordered a vegetable one instead of pork or chicken.  The taste was all right just not what I expected.  The noodles were good that's what makes this dish but the vegetables were a little over cooked.

$8 for the Ginger Garlic Pork was well worth it for this dish.  Love the garlic ginger taste combining the pork and vegetables.  This was put together nicely  and not over cooked.

To complete the order I added 2 $1.50 cokes and 1 $2.50 thai  ice tea.  Nobody took the thai ice tea so it was saved for the next day.  When we did decide to have it, in the late evening, it was still good.  And, that's an excellent price.

Overall I was happy with the meal.  It was delivered when everything was still hot.  It came in 35 minutes.  I also ordered this at 8:15pm, they close at 9pm, the lady was nice and pleasant taking my order."}
{"text":"What an awesome lil gem! Was craving some yellow curry and found this place on yelp. Ended up ordering yellow curry and crab fried rice. Both were delicious. Place was spotless inside. Friendly staff great prices. Generous portions. What more could you ask for? Come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Limited seating and parking available, and the menu is so small they don't have a lot to choose from. They don't have orange chicken or something similar."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Las Vegas!
Small restaurant in the Las Vegas Arts District. Food was so fresh and had the awesome bold flavor you expect when traveling Thailand indulging in their best places to eat."}
{"text":"A blessing for the neighborhood.  Living right by the arts district, Im always looking for new spots. Some that pop up are expensive, however here comes D E Thai.  Really good prices for good food! I got the Chicken Drunken Noodles spice level 4. I was full after and it was spicy. I'll be back to try the other menu items. The crispy pork looks like my next item to try. Welcome to the neighborhood D E Thai!"}
{"text":"Downtown Las Vegas is easily the most exciting area in town and D E Thai Kitchen is one of those reasons. Reasonably priced, great food, and even better people working here. I have tried something different nearly every time I have visited and have not been disappointed. The \"Lad Na\" is a gem on the menu that people not too familiar with Thai food won't order but it deserves to be added to your food lexicon. I remember seeing D E Thai Kitchen being built and wanting to try and see if they could compete with all the other great options downtown and they delivered above and beyond.  De Thai Kitchen has a returning customer in me and I look forward to trying out the entire menu. Great start!"}
{"text":"Tried several different dishes. Everything is so tasty. Highly recommend coconut shrimp. Happy tummy"}
{"text":"Bangkok Street Food

DE Thai kitchen menu is short and sweet! I stopped by this afternoon after passing by after work for nearly a month. The restaurant itself is small but comfortable. The furniture and deco is minimal but very mod and super clean!

I ordered Shrimp Pad Thai $10 which arrived to my table quickly and piping hot! The spice level was perfect (8) and the portion size is decent. Great fresh flavors without oily residue (which is common at a few overrated Thai joints in town). I'm very pleased with my selection.
 
Spicy papaya salad $7 is another great menu item! Spice level (7)!! I left breathing fire out my mouth like a dragon but it was worth it. I handled that spice like a champ!  
Veggie egg rolls $4 deliciousness
Thai Tea $2.50

Total $25 of course I'll be back"}
{"text":"Fabulous! Well worth the trip to this restaurant. Not many tables, but very clean and more importantly.... Delicious Thai food.  I would highly recommend going. Everything was fresh, made to order and absolutely fantastic! I have been a Thai food lover for a long time and this restaurant certainly surpassed all my expectations. Will definitely be coming back if I'm in the downtown area."}
{"text":"The manager was the shit very informative on his heritage and their food. It's small but I'll be here every day I'm in Vegas hopefully with the same group of friends!"}
{"text":"Tried the Beef Jerky and it was AMAZING!!!!  Definitely coming back to try other dishes for sure....multiple times I'm sure...."}
{"text":"Family owned restaurant in downtown Las Vegas. Get authentic Thai food for a great price! Staff is very friendly. Had no wait time & the food came out hot & fresh to the table. It's a great place to eat as a family, couple, or alone. We had Thai tea, Thai style fried rice, pad Thai, beef jerky, spicy basil. It was all great!!! Definitely worth trying, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good.  asf. The place itself is small and cute and clean and just a nice atmosphere. It's like a modern feel. The food is amaZing. I got shrimp pad Thai and make sure you get the Thai iced tea!!!!! I never had anything like it before. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nah. 

Walked in around 4p on a Saturday and the place was empty. The limited menu is not substitute friendly so beware if you have food issues/special requirements. I had the pad thai with shrimp/crab rangoon and my friend had the noodles and chicken/egg rolls. My pad Thai had good flavor, though my noodles were rubbery. My crab rangoon came FROZEN in the middle. They took them back and heated them up, still lackluster. They're definitely more of a \"cream cheese with pink pieces\" Rangoon instead. 
My friend didn't like the chicken or the noodles in her meal but really enjoyed her egg rolls. Said they were some of the best she's ever had."}
