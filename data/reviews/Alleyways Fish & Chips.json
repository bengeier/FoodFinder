{"text":"The shop has tables for eating in and sells food to take away. Today, we ordered and paid for fish & chips, and then the clerk/cook told us she was closing in 5 minutes. She wouldn't let us eat at a table, even after we promised to eat fast. We were sent outside, and there was no place nearby for us to even sit and eat, let alone eat at a table. 
The clerk should tell people if she is selling takeaways only before they have paid for the food.
On top of that, the food was only mediocre and they charge 10p for a small packet of tartare sauce.
Horrendous customer service; not great food."}
{"text":"Alleyways used to be my favourite local chippy, it's not as good as it was but is usually pretty good. Good value for money and do have an extensive selection."}
{"text":"Pretty poor compared to the other nearby chippy on Falsgrave corner. The chips are often thin and greasy, the batter soggy. Can't recommend them I'm afraid."}
