{"text":"I ordered the veggie hash and was extremely disappointed. It was basically just a plate of sad boiled potatoes and a few soggy vegetables. There was literally NO seasoning on anything. Like something my grandma would have cooked in the war. I also ordered a small, black drip coffee and my bill came to over $20! The small drip coffee itself was over $3.50, which is crazy, let alone paying for the sad, plain food. The waitress was nice but dang the food was so gross. Maybe if I had ordered something else it would have been better but it seemed like they didn't even care if the food tasted good at all."}
{"text":"We were not planning on eating at Mat's as we thought it was only a breakfast/brunch restaurant. We were surprised to see it open at 8pm so we ventured in and I'm glad we did. If your craving a breakfast item at 7pm this is the place to go, not feeling breakfast that's okay they have a good selection of items that are more lunch/dinner friendly. We were impressed by the food as well as the outstanding service. Looking forward to returning for brunch or dinner sometime soon!"}
{"text":"It is an awesome place. Butter chicken poutine is a MUST try!!! The waiter is really nice and accommodating, the place is so homey. Will definitely come back."}
