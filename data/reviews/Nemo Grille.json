{"text":"Our first time coming to Nemo's.  After making a reservation earlier that day, we showed up and were sat immediately.  Initial service coming to our table was a little slow, and we were not provided menus at the time we sat down.  When our server did arrive, we ordered everything (wine, salad, main course).  Nemo's also brings bread to your table.  Smaller loaf was accompanied by a sweet butter.  Wine by the glass selection was good, and we ordered a Pinot Noir and Malbec.  Both good selections that got our dinner experience off on the right foot.  The dinner selections were Braised Short Ribs and Grouper.  With each meal, we received a healthy portion, and did not have much room for dessert.  These two main courses certainly hit the spot.  The ambiance of the room where we were sat was a little bright for the time of day (evening).  Our table felt like we were out in the open.    Overall, we were glad we tried Nemo's.  I don't think anyone would be disappointed with the food, but not sure I would rush to come back."}
{"text":"Overpriced good old boys club for baby boomers.  The place has a decent menu with daily specials.  It took our food 90 minutes from order to table.  Larger groups were served before our table of two.  Waitress kept covering for kitchen staff with plausible excuses (burned our appetizer and the kitchen \"not talking to us\"). For a meal over $100 for two people and no alcohol this is really atrocious.  Waitress took off the price of the cheapest entree.  Either the kitchen is in trouble or the management is, either way there was nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"We keep coming back to this place for its calamari, Moscato and braised short ribs...not to mention their excellent service. I'm a very picky person but I LOVE their calamari and their lobster flatbread with truffle honey. A must try!"}
{"text":"Came into town late on a Monday night and bar was warm and welcoming.  Sheamus our bartender was the best.  Nice selection on their bar menu with choices under $15.  Lots of beer and wine choices too.  Had the Kobe burger with rosemary garlic fries which was delicious and Lasagna off the regular menu.  We were both very happy.  Coming back when we are in town."}
{"text":"We ate here recently, I ordered the duck which was very good.  My wife got the Lasagna, which fell short of the mark.  Waitress very helpful in wine selection and service."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food!  The ambiance is nice/average and it's set in an old century home.  I had the Chilean seabass and it was incredible!  My husband had the short ribs which were also delicious.  I'd highly recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Best kept secret on the West side of Cleveland. You will not be disappointed. Both the food and service are outstanding."}
{"text":"Our trip was decent overall.  I had the sirloin with blue cheese butter sauce.  While a great cut and sauce, it was very undercooked.  When ordered medium it was served rare.  But still good enough.  My wife had the ravioli.  It wasn't bad tasting, just not what was expected.  The service was nothing short of excellent."}
{"text":"This place truly is a gem. Besides the fantastic service...every waiter or waitress we've ever had is mature, intelligent, and knowledgeable..the food is great! The shrimp and grits are so good I can barely describe them. The hummus is great as well. Fantastic place all around."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in the Cleveland area.  Great place to go on a date or just out for a really nice evening.  Everything here is good - food, atmosphere, drinks and service.  We go here when we really want a good meal and don't mind paying more for it because the food and whole experience is worth it.  You don't leave hungry or feeling like you were just ripped off."}
{"text":"Wonderful all around, the pictures do not do it justice! Calamari best ever, the kale and romaine salad with citrus vinaigrette was amazing!  We haven't even had our entrees yet! Service fantastic and servers professional and personable! Thank you Nemos"}
{"text":"Bruschetta appetizer was very good. My steak was only warm. My veggies wer cold. My potatoes were so cold they would not melt the seasoned butter on top of them. It was like they just came out of the fridge. The service left much to be desired too. Our waitress showed up only to take our orders, drop off our food and bring the bill.  I expected much much more for the price. We wont be going back."}
{"text":"Gluten free friendly and very accommodating:)  we have dined here several times and have even done take out as it is close to our house... They prepare a nice meal and we like the ambience as well!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner. .had the filet mignon. .it was very good...my  DH he had the boom boom shrimp,  his portion seemed a bit small...overall a nice place to dine"}
{"text":"By far one of the hidden gems of the Cleveland dining scene.  Service is great and the food is fantastic.  The staff gets to know you by name and are always friendly.  I almost always order one of the specials."}
{"text":"Phenomenal restaurant with great staff and amazing food. We are lucky to have such a great place locally. Best bar tenders in avon. Great bar and dinner menus. Specials are a must. We are literally here weekly, if not twice a week. I'm a total foodie and this is the place to be."}
{"text":"We're new to the Avon area and wanted to check out Nemo Grille just from driving by it and because of all the great reviews. We made a reservation for Friday night and we absolutely loved it! Our sever was attentive, provided helpful guidance around the menu and she made us laugh. I ordered the Waldorf salad and the halibut special. My husband got the Caesar salad and the ny strip. The food was unique and delicious! Also, I believe it's reasonably priced. Would recommend Nemo Grille to anyone in a heartbeat and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very nice fish selection and reasonable wine list (decent priced bottles but they go out of their way to pick nice selections instead of just marking up grocery store junk). Online GC makes this a great deal. Only downside is it can get very crowded and loud so try to avoid really busy times."}
{"text":"Enjoyable dining experience with one big other... Wife researched a place close to her parents to have our low key anniversary dinner.  We chose to sit at the bar have drinks and apps.   Shrimp & Gritts great/Fish Tacos excellent/Lobster Flatbread...OK.    After watching the bartender give a free drink(translation the bottom of a bottle of wine)to a lady we were conversing with on the occasion of her birthday and then trying to get the other lady to buy another glass to match it...we were on guard.  He berated the handing of the free glass from one to the other, when it was clear the patron was somewhat concerned about driving.  We ultimately mentioned our anniversary in the context of the birthday mode, everyone at the bar congratulated us but the bartender. He overtly said he didn't care about anniversaries.  Then attempted to pad the bill in the most tacky low class, chain restaurant way with throwing the desert plate in front of us and then suggesting what we would pick.    4 plus stars downgraded or the service."}
{"text":"Good food and good service! Loved the free dessert thanks to the Yelp check in! We will totally be back. It'd be nice if the place was a little bigger. It's definitely tight inside and hard to have a conversation without hearing all the others going on around you."}
{"text":"Really good food. The food is a little on the rich side, tho. My palette was overwhelmed fairly quickly. Dine outside if you can because there isn't enough lifting inside."}
{"text":"Great service.  The wait staff were all very nice and extremely attentive even though it was a busy Saturday night.  The food was rich but extremely tasty, with very nice plating/presentation.  The sea scallops i had were large and perfectly cooked.  The dessert offerings all looked amazing - wished i could have tried them all!  On top of it the atmosphere is relaxed and unpretentious.  You can dress up, but you can also wear jeans.  Thoroughly enjoyed my first visit and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. Love the food, the service & the atmosphere. It's a little pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"We went on Sunday (half priced bottles of wine btw) and I got the pork chop special which was out of this world. Tender, cooked to perfection. Regular menu items are awesome but be sure to check Facebook for their weekend specials too. Never disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Well folks, you thought you'd have to go to the big city for something unique and fine but fun. This place is amazing. I travel the US as a businessman and foodie. You must eat here."}
{"text":"Not a best kept secret anymore.  Gourmet food in a family run neighborhood atmosphere.  Can't go wrong with any menu item, especially a filet mignon or sea bass.  They didn't make us feel bad for not being dressed up and in fact were very welcoming.  Love this place.  Go here, do this and tip well!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to have dinner and happened across this place. We were greeted by very friendly staff and the atmosphere was inviting as well.   Seared Tuna appetizer was a little underwhelming. Second course was a special Asian salad, that was a little over-dressed, but otherwise delicious. For an entree, I had the filet with garlic and blue cheese butter with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Everything on the plate was delicious. Service was very friendly and proficient.   Interesting and decent wine list as well. All made for a very nice evening.  Would return."}
{"text":"They actually read their reviews. Their food used to be too salty, but now perfectly seasoned. Just about anything on the menu is a treat!"}
{"text":"This restuarant deserves 5 stars. I've dined there several times... for an anniversary, small business dinner, large group for business and 'just because'. Each time the service and food was amazing (especially the scallops). The prices are a little higher but you walk in knowing you're paying for an amazing dining experience and will not be disappointed. Nice job- Nemo Grille stays on our top 10 on the West Side of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Love the food here, totally recommend having a nice romantic dinner, quite and intimate. Service is excellent and everybody is so nice."}
{"text":"Still a 5-star rating!  Celebrated my parents birthday at Nemo grill last Sunday.  They had never been there and could not have been more pleased.  Our waitress on the porch (5:00 reservation)...wish I could remember her name but she has waited on us before is professional, courteous and fun.  Between the 4 of us we had the lobster bisque, stuffed pepper soup and ceasar salad to start.  Entrees were the veal scalloppini, scallops, duck and lobster fettuccine.  I wanted to lick the bowl clean after finished the fettuccine.  Everyone was so pleased with their meals and the service.  Finished our meals with creme brulee and they brought my parents one of the chocolate desserts, complimentary, for their birthday complete with candles.  Cannot say enough good things about this restaurant.  Thanks Nemo for making my parents birthday celebration special!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service....we will definitely return! Mac and cheese dish outstanding,  decadent desserts!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal! The shrimp and grits appetizer with bbq sauce was a really refreshing take on a classic. Nicely charred shrimp, tasty grits, and not too heavy to over power the entree. My husband got the special pan seared New York strip steak with a horseradish butter. He thought it might have been the best NY strip he has ever had. I had the Chilean sea bass. The butter cream was delicious. The pasta that came with it was a nice treat. It tasted homemade and fresh. We really enjoyed this meal and the intimate setting (although it was a little loud).  Also, the service was perfect...not too intrusive but very attentive."}
{"text":"Honestly we came here because Strip down the street could not seat is (they only take reservations). Nemo far exceeded our expectations. Great atmosphere, the service was exceptional, and the best food I have had in years. Definitely worth the trip, you will not be disappointed! And get the calamari!!"}
{"text":"Will forever be my wife and I go to place for anniversary and birthday dinners together. Low lighting and antique ambiance make the place perfect date night material. Now the food is out of this world and I highly recommend the Sea Bass and the Shrimp and Grits for an appetizer. My wife loves the steak with a pear salad that is very unique and served with beets. Never been disappointed here. Go and see for yourself and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I bordered on 4 or 5 stars here and ultimately made my decision based on a little slower service than I think a 5-star deserves in addition to a slightly cramped atmosphere. This isn't to say the service or atmosphere was poor, but in trying to be critical with what I call 5-star, I feel Nemo Grille fell a little short.  We decided to eat here the Sunday prior to Valentine's Day in order to celebrate early (and because it is challenging to find a sitter on Valentine's Day). We were seated pretty quickly in a room that was dimly lit that contained nine tables. In the room immediately connected was a large party and this is really where my major \"issue\" lies. Due to the slightly cramped space, noise carries here...a lot. At times it was challenging to have a conversation. Also, as a result of the large party, our server needed to provide additional attention to that table which rubbed me a little bit the wrong way; however I reiterate that this is a critical assessment and not a deal breaker.  Prior to the main course, I had the lobster bisque. Everyone has their own tastes, but I am a huge fan of homemade lobster bisque and feel that Nemo Grille is bordering on one of my favorites. The bisque is a bit creamy with a few visible pieces of lobster, but you can certainly taste it mixed into the cream. If you are a fan, I would certainly recommend trying it.  For dinner I had the duck which came with a raspberry glaze, asparagus, and some garlic mashed potatoes. There isn't a thing on the plate I disliked. The glaze was something that almost kept me from ordering the duck, but at the end of the day I feel like it really brought the dish together by adding the sweetness. The duck was cooked perfectly! If I had to guess, I would say it was done sous vide and then finished when the rest of the plate was ready. If you ever have duck and no pink exists...it was overcooked. This was a nice consistent reddish pink that was warm throughout. Add in the glaze and I almost wanted to buy a second plate to take home.  During the meal we also had a bottle of wine. Being a Sunday, we got the bottle half off. This effectively brought the cost close to what we would spend at the store to buy a bottle and bring it home. Overall I would say Nemo Grille is one of the better quality food restaurants in the area, though at a price point that can make it challenging for some. If compared to some places outside the area, it feels more appropriate at a four star, but bordering on five."}
{"text":"Visited twice in almost a single week! Excellent service for Mother's Day.  Had the veal with butternut squash soup to start one day and then went back and had the salmon special of the day with a pear salad to start! Loved both the soup and the salad.    Dessert was bread pudding and I would recommend it with the sea salt caramel instead! Dessert comes out on a tray for you to select, so it changes! Also saw tiramisu, chocolate cake, a different type of cheesecake, and a brownie"}
{"text":"Alert screaming babies allowed on a Friday night at 8:00 pm. THE OWNER said there was nothing he could do?? Tiny space with hardwood echoing the cries. Really? $300.00 check  added insult to injury for marginal food at best."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We came in with a birthday group and were treated great. Menu is varied from pasta to seafood and steaks. Everyones meal was super."}
{"text":"Finally made it to the legendary NEMO.    It was worth the wait.  Excellent service. Food was great and a very relaxed atmosphere.   Enjoyed it very much and looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Wonderful service, fresh crisp salad, yummy creamy mushroom soup with truffle Parmesan croutons, and really delicious salmon over coconut rice and grilled vegetables! The chef is creative, while giving you healthy amazing food!!! We will go back on our next trip. Great food, great service and charming atmosphere. Thank you for an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"Delish!       The unassuming building truly houses a restaurant with skilled chefs, exceptional staff, and good food.  We stopped by after a long day, only 20 minutes before their kitchen \"closed\" (we called ahead to ask if we would be \"those people\" and they happily responded that we should definitely still stop by).  We sat at the bar, where many others were enjoying wine and appetizers.  The bartender was lovely, one of the best servers I've experienced.  We ordered two glasses of wine (somewhat pricey at 13 a glass, but we knew what we were paying and were not surprised when our bill came), and a calamari to start.  The calamari (9.5) was a bit on the sweet side, but it was cooked very well.       For dinner we got a grilled chicken sandwich (10), with a side of rosemary garlic fries, and the veal (26).  We asked our server if any dairy products were in the veal meal, and she said no, but when the the plate arrived, there was milk in the mashed potatoes.  She quickly got us a side of sweet potato fries as a substitution, and was apologetic.  The sandwich, and veal were fantastic... both of the fries were not (one was flimsy, wet, and undercooked; the other was incredibly spicy with seasoning that's too intense).  Our server noticed that we didn't eat our fries, asked about it, and said she would tell the kitchen for the future (even though we told her the rest of our meal was great and we weren't upset).  We also ordered a piece of coconut cake (8.5) and it was wonderful - definitely ask about their desserts (the women next to us RAVED about the smores creme brulee).      Was our food perfect?  No. But were we happy?  Definitely.  The great service made up for the tiny bumps in the meal.  Loved it. Will definitely return!         Full disclosure - we used a groupon for the meal (paid $25 for a $50 gift certificate), but we would definitely pay \"full price\"."}
{"text":"Some restaurants offer home-style cooking.  Nemo Grille offers home-style seating - it's literally a retooled home, with small rooms where it's not hard to imagine the place where a couch and television used to be.  It's like they evicted a family just for your comfort, giving you the lovely air of being a rich landlord dining with your table legs resting upon the bones of starving poor people.   ....Seriously, though, it's like being invited into someone's home to eat.  I like the intimacy of small rooms.  The only problem with a setup like this is that if the table next to you is loud, as they were here, it's like having six people yelling at each other in a cramped room - there's no escape.    That said, eating in someone's house isn't a thrill - the dining is.  And Nemo, fortunately, delivers.    I must confess that any restaurant gets an automatic +1 star on my rating if they do bread right - and Nemo has the best bread in the area.  Most places have bread that is:   a)  Hot, b)  Possessed of a great crust;  c)  Possessed of a moist interior.  You get your choice of a, b, or c, so you can have hot average bread, or cold bread with a great crust and a doughy, tasteless interior, or a great fluffy inside with meh crust served cold.  Nemo combines the three with just a hint of garlic butter for a bread orgasm, shooting them up to five stars.  Then the guys at the table next to me started yammering on about something that required 120 decibels to discuss properly, bringing it down to four stars again.    For an appetizer, we had a flatbread pizza that was thoroughly okay - not a patch on what you can get at Three Birds, but perfectly serviceable.  The other was a seared tuna, which I do not care for, but the girls at the table rolled back their heads in orgasmic delight.    My meal was an upscale macaroni cheese and bacon dish that was phenomenal; the pasta DEFINED the term \"al dente,\" and the cheese was cheesy without being overwhelming.  The only ding was that there wasn't enough bacon - but frankly, given that they could have hauled a wheelbarrow full of bacon up to the table and I still would have wanted more bacon, so it's hard to fault them for this.    My wife had the scallops.  She always says, \"No, I'm going to look at the menu,\" but it's a bald lie; if there are scallops, she is getting them.  And she gave these scallops a high thumbs-up.    In short, Nemo's right on the bubble; one more good meal there and it could jump to five stars.  As it is, the loudness of the place and the fact that the appetizers were above-average but not excellent makes me give it four stars... for now.  But like a culinary Terminator, I WILL be back."}
{"text":"Nemo is one of my favorite places in Clevelands far west side. The patio anytime of year is so charming. The food is always to die for. Service is A+, and half price bottles of wine on Sunday's! It's my annual birthday tradition!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Decent wine options. Decent location with below average parking. Been here a few times and it was strictly out of convenience."}
{"text":"We stopped into Nemo Grille on a whim, just to see what it was all about.  It was ok... Staff was friendly and not overly attentive but, available when needed.  Menu had plenty to offer but, even though our meals were good, we didn't feel like they were impressive.  We will definitly give Nemo Grille one more chance before writting it off."}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing service! They don't stop treating you until you walk out the door. Even filling up our water glasses while we were paying! Can't beat it. Food was yummy! 3 different types of mashed potatoes is way to this girls heart. Can I get an amen?! Not to mention the atmosphere! We sat on the enclosed porch while it was raining and it was beautiful. Everyone go!"}
{"text":"Fantastic from start to finish. The environment is slightly cramped, but cozy and romantic enough to make up for it. My group ordered duck, sea bass, and veal which were all delicious. All of our meats were cooked perfectly and the flavors of the garnishes and sides all blended very well. The presentation of all the meals were extravagant as well. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to go on a very nice date or if you just want to have an awesome meal on an average night. The hours are a little different though. They open at 5pm every day, so dinner only. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Food: interesting combinations.  Done very well.  Service: very good.  Very nice and friendly staff  Ambience: romantic if inside.  Outside: avg.  Small place overall.  Value: 3/5.  Salmon, light potato coupled with dinner salad and 1 glass wine: $55 , High."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's labeled as a steakhouse on yelp but I am not sure I would call this a steakhouse. More seafood or maybe even American-French but not steak, although they have steak.  First off, Nemo has some top notch bar tenders. I am normally a craft beer snob but at nemo I will try the drinks they concoct. For appetizers they have a wide array of small to medium dishes I have had the shrimp and grits and the calamari and I promise you both of those are great. The lobster bisque is pretty darn good too. The sea-bass is as good as you will find anywhere and the veal, don't get me started on the veal.....go, just go. Trust me."}
{"text":"I can not say enough good things about this restaurant! Went for a birthday dinner and once for happy hour. The lobster bisque is the most delicious things have EVER eaten. I would make a trip just for that. I love the old house layout with such a  romantic ambience!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and eat in nice places.  Had 6+ dinners at Nemo Grille always great, last week duck was Not over cooked, good presentation and quality.  Service excellent."}
{"text":"Went there last night for a birthday. We got there a few minutes late for our res (we called on the way) and it was handled well.  I had seared pork tenderloin.  My wife had the salmon special.  We both got the salad special.  We didn't have drinks.  Service throughout the meal was above average.  The wait staff was attentive without being fawning, friendly and engaging without being too familiar, efficient without being pushy.  My wife's salmon was very good, my pork good.  The chutney could have been warmed up a bit before being applied.  The home fries that came with it were great.  My wife very much enjoyed her salmon.  I had a taste of it and agreed.  We shared a piece of lemon chiffon cake for dessert; it was good, not great.  Prices are a bit on the high side but nobody is coming here looking for a bargain.  If you don't want to pay $22 for an entree, there's always Bob Evans.  We hadn't been here before but were impressed and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"While I think the bread pudding I had for dessert was fair/good, the grits and shrimp was amazing. I mean I've had shrimp that good before, but the grits were insanely good. Excellent service as well!"}
{"text":"Nemo Grille, or Nemo's as I call it, has been a long-time favorite of mine and my husband. It offers a great blend of fantastic food, nice wine list and wonderful service (without feeling too stuffy or over bearing).   Wine/Cocktails - Typically I take advantage of their nice wine list. Their \"by the glass\" selection is great if you aren't planning on going for a full bottle. My husband is a bourbon drinker and they always have a nice selection. Martini list seems pretty extensive as well if that's your cocktail of choice!   As for the food, I have never had a bad dish, whether it be an appetizer, salad or entrée.   Appetizers - I love the Shrimp & Grits, which is always a nice dish to share. My favorite is the Seared Ahi Tuna - a nice portion of tuna over Udon noodles. All of their salads are nice, and of a nice size, if you are looking to go that route.   Entrees - I'm a creature of habit and almost always order their scallops, but it's because they are fantastic! Always, always perfectly prepared. Depending on the season, the scallops are paired with a delicious risotto.  I've had an Ahi Tuna special before as well which was wonderful. My husband has had the lamb chops and filet - again all perfectly prepared.   Desserts - Save room, because their selection is nice. They typically have a display, so even if you aren't hungry, you'll make room  Service - We have always had great service here. It's a nice mix of high-end service, but approachable and not stuffy. It's a great place to just relax, have a nice dinner and enjoy the time with your dining companion.   We always sit on the patio, regardless of season (it's heated in the cooler months), but the inside dining rooms are the actual rooms of the historic home - which just adds to the charm. We've always wanted to come for their happy hour - their bar seems like a lot of fun.   All in all - regardless of where you live in the Cleveland area - a visit to Nemo Grille will be one you will want to make (again and again!)."}
{"text":"I love Nemo Grille!  The restaurant has a lot of character and the food is awesome.  My favorite dish is their chicken that is covered with sundried tomatoes, wild mushrooms and pancetta.  It is so good!  Nemo Grille is   on my top 5 list to recommend to someone looking for a great restaurant on the west side of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant with wonderful food. It's in an old historic home with a great atmosphere and tons of charm. The staff is very friendly and had great recommendations. The strip steak was really good and had a delicious mushroom sauce with mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Excellent food with great service! Try the Chilean Sea Bass - it's phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Went to Nemo Grille and wasn't impressed compared to the cost $$$. Had seared Auhi-tuna app which was a bit fishy. Lobster bisque was more sherry cream then lobster which wasn't real great at all. The staff was nice but not overly helpful.  They seemed to busy and under staffed."}
{"text":"This is our absolute favorite place to eat in the area. Best steaks anywhere, and the lobster bisque is outstanding. The service is excellent, and all the employees work together as a team. Excellent service every time we have been. Even the coffee is great. What a refreshing change it is to find a place that cares about the food they offer and certainly cares about their customers. Excellent ++++"}
{"text":"I should preface this review by saying we usually enjoy the ambiance and food at Nemo Grille and have been there many times without issue.    Unfortunately, a few weeks ago, my husband and I visited Nemo for a night out. We sat at the bar and were less than impressed.  We asked the bartender what the specials were and he seemed annoyed that we were there for the evening happy hour. A family came in shortly after and the bartender appeared to know them. At this point, he devoted all of his attention to them and neglected the rest of the bar.  He then started pouring the group shots 'on the house' and offered a shot to a few other patrons at the bar excluding us; he himself took one and gave one to the hostess.    For such a nice establishment as Nemo Grille is, it was disappointing to see it so unprofessional and caddy.  We felt like we were not welcomed nor was our business appreciated."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and Becky was one of the best servers I've had. Great place and the bread pudding was delicious."}
{"text":"We all LOVED it here! Definitely coming back with more loved ones..The service there is impeccable and that's a must for an upper class restaurant in my opinion. Entrees were adventurous and appetizers made me want more! I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, so when there's a gem of a place this close by it's a must to visit every now and then. I had the duck breast with fig sauce and caramelized onion mashed potatoes. More of my other friends played it safe with filet mignon and chimmichura sauce. Another friend had sea scallops which were cooked to perfection!! I'll tell you something some places leave you with the sand in the scallops leaving you and your teeth feeling gritty but not this place def thumbs up!"}
{"text":"What a cool little neighborhood gem! I moved out to Avon some time ago and saw this place. From looking at their menu they are very much a gourmet establishment. Prices a little steep but its worth it.  The place is an old house with European decor, plaster walls, etc... It is cool but VERY cramped. Just don't have any weird conversations because everyone will be able to hear you.  We started with the lobster flatbread. It was excellent. It had a truffle honey glaze so expect the sweetness cause it will be there. For the entree I had the chicken marsala. I am a marsala man and I can say that this was one of the best! Excellent presentation and the right amount of sauce. The dish was perfect and the asparagus side, while expected, was also perfectly cooked.   I really enjoyed the meal, the cramped atmosphere even, and the service. It was a great night and I will be coming back as soon as I can stomach another bill. Come ready to fork out some dough but it is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Found this gem through Yelp. Lovely building. Fantastic food. Bonus -- all bottles wine half price in Sundays and the wine list is excellent. My husband had a perfectly cooked medium rare steak with lovely traditional shallot sauce. I had gnocchi with wild mushrooms (app) which was amazing! Margherita flatbread very good. I will surely stop here next time I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The steak I ordered was poor quality and overcooked. Service was also below par. Unfortunately, I will not be returning nor recommending this restaurant to locals or visitors to area."}
{"text":"Food was very good. It was just very loud in the dining area where we sat. Had to yell just to have a casual conversation."}
{"text":"5 out of 5 without a doubt.  Went here for family members birthday with a group of 5. Place was busy, but service was excellent. The place is an old house, so layout is snug but nice. Helen was our waitress, and was a rockstar!!   Got the steak special which was good. Also got the Cajun shrimp app, which was amazing, I just wish there was more shrimp. Also got app of calamari which was also great.   After got the dessert of flan, which was amazing and the brownie, which was large and soo chocolaty words can't describe.    Definitely recommend for an amazing dinner experience. Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"We have been to several wine paring dinners at Nemo's that were excellent so we decided to try it for a Saturday dinner.  We were greeted at the hostess stand and given the option to be seated inside or on the porch we choose the porch as it is more intimate and quiet.  This is a white table cloth and cloth napkin restaurant we were dressed accordingly, but I was disappointed to see many of the guests dressed as if they were about to do yard work .  Our server Hanna was very attentive and gave us the wine list, specials and menu before taking our drink order.  She returned promptly with the half  bottle of champagne we chose as a starter.  The wine list is modest but, more than adequate ,  limited in French wines with a good variety of Italian wines. They also have a number of wines available in half bottle format which is nice.   We had the calamari to start with don't miss it the sauce is not the usual marinara but a wonderful Thai chili aiol. It's spicy not hot. A great starter.  The soup and salads we had were very well done with house made salad dressings and fresh tasty broths . As a main course I had the scallops and my wife had a prime sirloin steak.  The scallops were cooked to perfection accompanied with an excellent mushroom risotto, asparagus and a lovely light sauce. I love scallops but this preparation was amazing my only regret I couldn't finish it,but will have the rest for lunch tomorrow. My wife's steak was perfectly done to her liking accompanied with asparagus,whipped potatoes and the optional  wild mushrooms. I noticed that she stopped talking and savored every bite until it was gone. Only then remarking how good it was. Prime beef will do that it was a good steak .   We were both stuffed but the desert tray presented by our server was enticing. We shared a creme brulee and boxed a piece  of Triple chocolate  cake.  The brulee was again perfectly done with a nicely flamed sugar crust topped with a strawberry and a few fresh  blueberries .  It was a truly lovely experience, the setting in a I believe to be century home was warm and inviting with tables arranged in the various rooms with a bar as you enter.   We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Date night dinner destination. The place is small and romantic. I'd recommend making a reservation.   Andy still talks about the salmon here, hands down the best he's ever had. I love the dessert menu, they bring a tray with one of each dessert for you to choose. It's very difficult to choose just one!   If you're going to splurge, this is the place to do it."}
{"text":"Wow... put this on your list of \"Must Do\"  I drove a ways to check out this gem!  I was not dissapointed!  What a great experience!  It has a great setting, ideal location with easy access to parking and the atmosphere was so warm and cozy.  Food choices where awesome across the board.  Although I sat in the bar, the bartender was so nice and attentive to me.  I asked what they thought was their specialty and went with the Chilean Sea Bass.   They were not kidding.  It was an awesome presentation and tasted even better than it looked.  The portion was perfect too.  The truffle cheese suchetti that accompanied the sea bass was to die for.  It complimented it perfectly.  Many times your get a pricey meal and know you are paying for either the food or the atmosphere.  The location, ambiance, quality, service doesn't even make you think twice about it.   What a great experience.  I will be back and highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This is a great local restaurant in Avon. Excellent food and even though the prices are high you get what you pay for at this restaurant. I recommend anyone traveling to Avon to give it a try. If you live here in Avon and haven't been to Nemo Grille you should go there ASAP and get some good quality food."}
{"text":"i really want to love nemos. like really want to. however, i just think it is average. the restaurant itself is set in an old colonial style home. rooms/seating is small. bar is cute but again, very small. i did see a few patrons ordering the flatbread pizzas at the bar. i can not see myself going here for just 'bar' food. i might sit at the bar if i was waiting for a table, but the bar area is tiny.  food: so-so. i expected over the top amazing seafood but it did not wow me. i feel that when you are paying upwards of 20.00 for a dinner, you should have something good to rave about. with all that being said, i do not think i would be running back here any time soon."}
{"text":"Hands down, favorite restaurant on the west side! My fiancé and I eat here, at least, once a week. I love the comfortable, relaxed atmosphere, yet fine dining approach. I have never had a bad meal or negative experience at this restaurant; in fact, this is the perfect place to dine after a long, stressful day. We typically dine at the bar because we love the ambiance and being able to chat with the bartenders.  Our absolute favorite menu item is the Sea Bass; the best sea bass I have ever had. It is melts in your mouth; topped with a magical sauce and finished with Marcona almonds; so decadent, yet perfectly light. The bar burger is the best burger in town! I can guarantee, no matter what you order, you will be blown away.  I cannot say enough about Nemo! If you haven't been, please do yourself a favor, and head there tonight!"}
{"text":"Nemo Grill to me is just average. They do have a very nice wine list though.   I think that Nemo Grill is about 25% overpriced. If they were just a little less expensive then it would really be worth it for the meal that we are given."}
{"text":"Ordered a filet mignon and hubby got the swordfish- both amazing options, so filling and was laid out on the plate so nicely, something we just had to get on Instagram! Friendly staff- when I complained about how the AC was blowing a bit much on my legs, one of the waitresses rushed over to turn it off and cover it where we were sitting."}
{"text":"Great food, solid wine list.  It is small and there are hard wood floors throughout.  We always make a reservation.  The only complaint I have has nothing to do with the restaurant, but with those people who insist on bringing their children to higher end restaurants and letting them run amok.  Of course, I have the same problem at no so high end restaurants when people let their kids run amok.  The only problem here is that you are spending $$$ and there are hardwood floors and it is loud with out some four year and seven year old pounding through the place.  The waitress kept apologizing, to us, the table next to us.  Not her fault, although it might have helped if maybe someone from management had said something to the parents and grandparents.  I understand their not wanting to offend anyone but there were a lot of other people getting horribly annoyed.  Reign in your kids people or hire a babysitter."}
{"text":"I've now been to Nemo Grille three times and have to say it's one of my favorite restaurants, especially found locally. During typical business hours, it's best if you have a reservation - but you can typically squeeze a person or two in at the bar if you hate a wait. I was here on a Saturday, and within an hour of close. It seemed like everyone eating during this time was seated on the patio portion, which in Fall is enclosed and had some heating (it was comfortable and at one point almost a little too warm).  The service was excellent. The waiter was there when we needed him but not sitting there in our face (we recently had a waitress at another restaurant tell us about why service was not so good on the night we dined - and explained another girl called off because of boyfriend problems. My heart goes out to the girl, but hey, we didn't need to know that and we personally hadn't noticed any issues with the service at that place). They were great about refilling water when it was even half empty.  Both my dining companion and I started with the lobster bisque, which I highly recommend. It's also really filling - you have the option of a bowl or a cup (although only one price is listed on the menu). They are great at dining specials - I had rockfish with some amazing potatoes (baked with cheese in a ramekin). My companion had chicken marsala and left nothing on their plate. While we both felt pretty full, our waiter politely mentioned dessert (and wasn't pushy). When requested, he brought over a tray that showed the desserts and we opted to share the creme brulee. not the best ever, but pretty good! Worth the price, and to be fair, probably the best creme brule I've had, aside from the one made by my friend Erin. They also serve really fantastic bread, which goes with whipped garlic butter (not enough garlic for me, but I like enough to blow a house down). I could easily make a meal out of bread and bisque there.  It's not the most expensive place in town, but it sure isn't cheap. With a bottle of wine, 2 bisques, 2 entrees, and one dessert the bill was around $120. You could easily spend less or even split a meal. I also enjoy that while it's nicer food, you don't feel pressure to dress up. My dining companion and I were on our way to a birthday party and felt comfortable in jeans and a sweater. Although we were the last people (or two of the last?) to leave, we didn't feel rushed or like we were the jerks keeping the place open."}
{"text":"We live in the Bay Area and visit Lorain County 1 - 2 times/year and try to eat at Nemo Grille each visit.  My husband was surprised and delighted the first tme we dined here to find a Chave wine on the list!  The food is delicious and the service warm and accomodating (we've had to take our children here once or twice -- it was afterall a family vacation).  Especially memorable were the 1931 sherry (not sure of the exact year, but I think Hoover was President at the time) and the pasta heated in the big parmesan cheese drum.  We hope Nemo stays in Avon for many more years!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. Well developed flavors and sophisticated palette choices. Flawless execution. Never been disappointed.  Excellent service as well. Well worth the cost."}
{"text":"Gotta love this place. Recommended via flying service here local airport. Old house converted. My favorite setting. Most wonderful Italian chow and moscato Italian drink. I had a special order pasta with marinara, shrimp and sausage. My normal special request. Was excellent. Kinda short on sausage. Small strips of that only. Shrimp were larger and nice however. I sat in a heated, enclosed porch area. Surprised me that was the warmest room, and comfortable, in the house. I will be back. Perfect service here also."}
{"text":"My husband and I just left Nemo Grille.  We visited this restaurant based on yelp reviews. I made a reservation for 7:00 PM and received a phone call asking if they could move us to 7:15 PM. No problem. We arrived at 7:05 and sat at the bar and had a cocktail.  Cocktails were great. We weren't seated until 7:45 because they had an 88th birthday party in one of the rooms and the group decided to hang out. If I am the owner/manager of the restaurant I would advise my large party at the time they reserved the room that the room needed to be emptied by a certain hour to accommodate other reservations. It appeared that nearly everyone in our room was also waiting at the bar. Once seated the service by Helen was great. Short ribs were excellent and the filet was average but the potatoes with it were great. My major complaint with this restaurant was the noise level. It was deafening loud. I don't know if this is an acoustics issue or just obnoxiously loud people. Either way, this should be addressed by management.  I expect a fine dining experience to include the ability to talk in a normal tone of voice. It sounded more like a sports bar than an upscale restaurant"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for my birthday. This has it all. The service was exceptional. Our waitress was so sweet and patient. She knew the menu and helped us narrow down a choice! We were VERY satisfied with our meal. Everything was fresh and delicious. And don't even get me started on the dessert! Beautiful little spot. Thank you Nemo!"}
{"text":"Fairly straightforward American steakhouse fare (chops, familiar seafood, nice salads) executed very well. You're not likely to find any unusual cuts or terribly daring dishes, but everything is really good. It's just geared toward the suburban set, who are justifiably loyal. Service is prompt and competent. The atmosphere in an old house is cozy, but if it were up to me I'd turn the music down a notch or two and boost the lighting so that you can read a menu without the aid of a smartphone. That aside, you're quite certain to have a good meal here."}
{"text":"The BEST steak I have ever had in my life came from this jem.  The food is consistently executed well.  Would highly recommend to a foodie."}
{"text":"As a business traveler, this was a nice find for a first time area traveler.  My steak was cooked to my liking and the service that accompanied my meal was wonderful.  Great wine list and selection.  I will definitely return when in the area again!"}
{"text":"They do everything very well here! Solid menu, great food, prices are very reasonable...the environment feels comfy and hip and the service couldn't be more attentive. Love this new spot!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for awhile and I am glad I finally did. Yet another hidden gem in Lorain County.   My favorite part of this place is it's awesome atmosphere. The Nemo Grille is located in the historic Alten home which was built built in 1850. It is located on the corner of Detroit Road and State Route 611.  The dining room area(s) are located in the individual rooms of the old home. Within each room there about 5-7 tables. One recommendation, ask for a table along the wall. When my boyfriend and I went they sat us in a table located in the middle of one of the rooms. Nothing screams \"look at me eat\" like being seated smack dab in the middle of a room with everyone looking right at you. Thankfully, they were very accommodating and were able to move us into a corner. Each table has a nice little candle placed upon it and there are also candles along all of the walls. Each room has one lone ceiling fixture for lighting which keeps the romantic ambiance in check! There is also a nice bar area that is dimly lit.   The menu at the Nemo Grille is pretty limited. They have about 3-4 dishes listed under each section(seafood, chicken, steak, pasta, salads, etc).  That said, I had no problem finding something to eat.   I tried their Nemo Lasagna which was amazing. It consisted of fresh pasta layered with housemade bolognaise, Italian cheeses & fresh basil. It was a decent portion and I ended up having a little bit left over to take home. I also tried their Lobster Bisque soup. I thought the soup was ok, but definitely not the highlight of my dinner. I would have liked to have more chunks of lobster in it and a little less salt.   My boyfriend, who must eat a strict gluten-free diet, called ahead to make sure they could accommodate his needs. The chef said they would be able to. While they don't have a specific gluten-free menu they know which items are gluten free and are totally willing to change things up to accommodate dietary needs.  There were two menu items that were already gluten-free, the sea scallops and the sauteed chicken.  He opted for the chicken. I tried it and it was really good.  The chicken was covered with sundried tomatoes, wild mushrooms & pancetta and came with goat cheese mashed potatoes and broccoli.  He also had the Pear Salad with port wine vinaigrette dressing.   We each got a drink before our dinner. I tried the Cocoa Chai Cream Martini.  It was made with Voyant Chai Liquor, Godiva, Absolut Vanilla, cream and was  topped with shaved bitterweet chocolate. It was amazing! He got a regular old Jack Daniels and Ginger Ale. He thought it tasted a bit watery, but never said anything to the waitress. Later, he tried to order a plain ginger ale with dinner and the waitress notified him that it was out. He mentioned to her that his original Jack and Ginger tasted watery and it must have been because the ginger ale was out when they made his drink. At that point he hadn't even had half of his drink so we figured she would offer to replace it with something else, but she didn't apologize or offer to get him another.  I thought this was a bit odd, but we didn't say anything. Besides this little mishap the service was good and we were very happy with the fact that they were able to accommodate his gluten-free diet.   Overall the Nemo Grille is definitely a great restaurant. I thought the prices were reasonable. We paid about $85 (including tip) for both of our dinners, his salad, my soup, my martini and his mixed drink. It's definitely a gem in the Lorain County area! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here after not having a reservation at Strip next door and didn't want to wait two hours for a table. This is a nice little place and is located in the historic area of Avon. There isn't a lot of room in the restaurant though as it is located in a former house but it provides a nice atmosphere. The calamari appetizer had an interesting presentation. It came in a chinese food to-go box and served with chopsticks but the calamari tasted delicious. I would also recommend the sauteed chicken or anything off their butcher's block (minus the aged strip steak since I have always avoided strip steak if places offer filet mignon). Probably one of the best up-scale restaurant west of Cleveland, especially those living in the Avon and Elyria area. Service was great and food was delicious, what more can I ask for of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Food, service, atmosphere.....everything was phenomenal! First time, but definitely not our last!!!Ribeye was beyond amazing!!"}
{"text":"A great find in Avon Ohio. Opened since 2001 the chef creates amazing and details dishes. Being from the west coast it's hard to find sea bass. One of the best dishes I've ever had. Crispy on the outside and buttery inside. Took Yelp up on the free desert and ordered the homemade vanilla creme brûlée. If you are west of Cleveland you must trek out to Avon to experience this place. I travel all over the country and this was one of the top ten meals I've ever had. That's right. Avon Ohio."}
{"text":"We were in town on business on a a Sunday, didn't have reservations and the staff was very friendly and squeezed us in. Food was great and a cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tried Nemo after reading a lot of views on Yelp. It's was good, but not great.   We sat on the patio which is cute, but you are staring at traffic, so the view is not special.  Prices are on the higher side.  Bread and butter was good. Bread was crusty on the outside, soft on the inside and served warm. The butter was a bit sweet.  Crispy risotto cakes for an appetizer were tasty. 3 cakes.  The diver scallops were good, but the accompanying was stellar.   NY strip with horseradish Demi glacé was just okay. Mashed potatoes were highlight.  Dessert was disappointing for two reasons. First, the bread pudding wasn't that good. It lacked flavor. And then they didn't honor the Yelp checking coupon for free dessert so we ended up paying for it even after telling the waiter about it before ordering."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday dinner. First off, wine is half off a bottle on Sunday! Which was a nice surprise! We made a reservation and were sat immediately on the patio! It was very beautiful. We didn't think we would like it, but absolutely fell in love with it. It was heated and quaint. I got the lobster bisque, which I have seen good and bad reviews on. I loved it! It was slightly creamy, and there were big pieces  of lobster. I would definitely order it again!   I had the scallops and risotto, which was good. And when I checked in on Yelp we got a free desert! Kaitlyn was our server and she was very nice! Explained the menu and answered our questions. Was attentive but didn't hover over us! We loved her! I recommend stopping  at the bar for a drink and they also have a bar menu! So if you want to try the place out, this is an easy way to do it.    Just went for the Spanish wine dinner. I highly recommend signing up for one of these dinners! The food pairing with the wines was awesome! My husband and I enjoyed every course. We will definitely sign up for more of these!"}
{"text":"Just came back from one of the most amazing meals I've had since I moved to Cleveland (it's been 2 years). I had a sirloin and my date had the sea bass with these ricotta truffle noodles which were to die for.   Our server, Lynn, was phenomenal. Super knowledgable on the menu and an all around great server. Always had our water glasses filled and as soon as the food was gone, so were the plates! I HIGHLY recommend this place and ask for Lynn when you go in! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place to celebrate our anniversary!  Staff was very courteous and attentive.  Our server Helen had a beautiful smile on her face the entire time - made us feel relaxed and appreciated.  Started with roasted brussel sprouts - delicious.  I had Diver scallops -prepared perfectly on a bed of creamy risotto - awesome!! My husband had the braised short ribs - fall apart juicy and flavorful.  Desserts:  creme brûlée and the bread pudding - everything was delicious.  Can't wait to return.  Excellent dining in a casual relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"The setting is really charming.  Instead of knocking down an historic Western Reserve house and building a McMansion,  they turned it into a realy nice looking restaruant.  The staff adds to the homey atmosphere.  The maitre'd is vary warm and friendly and the young-ish wait staff is sweet and accomdating.  Despite the fact that all the tables are white draped and formal, no one has a problem showing up in jeans or with you showing up in jeans.  Of course, I would feel comfortable a bit dressed up as well.  The food is solid.  I had a fish fry with striped bass and sweet potato fries.  Very nice.  Mon cher chou had the chicken mac and cheese.  The staff even whipped up a bowl of buttered pasta for She Who All of a Sudden Didn't Want Anything.  Sadly, the hummous appetizer tasted like it was store bought roasted red pepper hummous, although the toasted pita and julienned veggies were a nice touch.  the wine list is large and has good range.  My one big criticism-- the place was really, really dark.  Not romantic dark, but more like get a flashlight to read the menu dark.  This is a nice place to take the family, or Mom."}
{"text":"Stopped here because of Yelp  Hannah sold every meal so well, we told her to choose for us  What a great meal, the duck am Ned sea bass,yum mm can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour & menu is awesome.  Great assortment of food choices all done right!!   Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Wow... Love the bar, great food.  Quaint and comfortable.  Great service. Loved it!  Will definitely go back.  Great place to go to and grab an app at the bar"}
{"text":"Had dinner there three weeks ago for the first time.  The food was exceptional as was the service.  I had the stuffed pepper appetizer and it was one of the best I've had.  There beet salad was phenomenal and the blackened scallops were done to perfection.  Nemo Grille is now one of my regular stops."}
{"text":"I loved this place the food is so amazing! And the service is very professional! Definitely a good place to celebrate any occasion! It is on the more expensive side but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I've never had anything but impeccable service and delicious food from Nemo Grille.  This is a diamond in the rough.  As previous reviewers have noted, the restaurant is an old home with several rooms.  The ambiance is dim and relaxed, and although it seems a bit fancy, many show up in jeans.  For appetizers I'd recommend the calamari, the mushroom gnocchi, the lobster bisque, or one of the salads (they usually have a special salad, too, which has always been delicious).    My favorite entrees include the Muscovy Duck breast and the filet.  I find it hard to steer away from the duck because I enjoy it so much, but I can be swayed by the mac and cheese or a special that sounds delicious.  I've only had dessert here once because I'm usually too full, but if they have it available, I would recommend without hesitation the Christmas Brulee.  It's a chocolate and Bailey's creme brulee that, if I'd had it at home, I would have licked the dish clean.  I would highly recommend Nemo to anyone in the Avon area, or the greater Cleveland area, for that matter.  It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Enclosed patio seating heated, great start. Service excellent, Helen was pleasant, fast and was not over bearing.  Appetizers, dinner and free dessert (Yelp free dessert) perfect. Pricey, but food was worth the price."}
