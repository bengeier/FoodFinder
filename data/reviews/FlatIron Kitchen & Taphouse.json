{"text":"Star with a hot, soft homemade pretzel with a unique mustard dip. A meal of NY strip done to perfection, crunchy asparagus, outstanding potatoes with pan gravy, and unique charred carrots. Wash it all down with local cidery Windy Hill's Ginger Gold. A perfect finish to the day, served up by a friendly and enthusiastic waiter who was present without being overbearing.   Vibe was casual as always, with good music and proper lighting that lent everything just the right level of buzz."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute beat. If you want to spend $50 per person and still be hungry this is your restaurant. I ordered Diver Sea Scallops for $28 and the order came out 3 scallops and 3 small pieces of cauliflower. I said something to the waitress because it was a surprise to only get such a small portion and her response was \"yes I hear that a lot actually\". The manager then came over, I thought it was to smooth things over but instead he tried to convince me I wasn't still hungry. Don't be fooled here, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! I don't understand why the overall score was so low, I would 100% recommend to a friend. The atmosphere: fun yet intimate enough to enjoy the people you came with. The wait staff was informed, polite, and very attentive; our finished plates were cleared quickly and quietly to better enjoy the meal. The food: delicious! We had vegetarians in our group, and we still had many offerings that created a variety of tastes. My favorite: the scallops. But the truffle fries are the must order of the night. Overall: perfect for date night, formal family night, even casual business. If you haven't gone to Flatiron then you are missing out on a delicious experience."}
{"text":"Got served two bad pork chops, one overdone, the next raw. Then told by the manager, Jason, that the raw version is what he expects his restaurant to serve as medium. Would not recommend this place to anyone who doesn't want to be ripped off. Can get better food at longhorn."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly, service was good and our meals were great. The herb chicken was tasty and the portions were generous. My boyfriend had the tenderloin which he said was good and he really enjoyed the clam chowder...he was very happy it was not overloaded with potatoes!"}
{"text":"Not as good as our first visit. We were so excited to have the calamari, fried oysters, and waygu sliders to split. Fried oysters and calamari are no longer on the menu...but they happened to have the calamari as a nightly app special. Sliders were tougher and lacked the onion relish that I so lived. Still have a nice local beer selection. Not sure if we'll be back"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The atmosphere makes it a great place to pop in for a drink/snack, or settle in for a great dinner.  The location is great...you literally cannot miss it.   The head chef is a culinary wizard!  Best salmon I've had in my entire life. I highly recommend getting it!"}
{"text":"I love shrimp and grits.  Anytime I see it on a menu I always order it.  The shrimp and grits at Flatiron are unique and may be the best I have ever tasted.  I highly recommend it with one of their signature cocktails, the Brown Sugar Manhattan!  Phenomenal."}
{"text":"Made reservations, table was waiting for us when we arrived. Server was great, food was too. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great food and knowledgeable waitstaff! I ordered my filet medium, and it arrived perfectly seared and well seasoned, with a juicy, warm, pink center. Appetizers were also delicious, especially the warm goat cheese dip and the French fries. Had the fresh fish special on a previous visit and this was also excellent. Wine list is also extensive, as are the specialty drinks and beer selections."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here last weekend.  We started with the Sliders as an appetizer--they were fantastic!  I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with a side of quinoa salad, it was literally the kind of food that you do a happy dance while eating.     He ordered the bacon burger and said it was great.  The customer service was on point.  I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Used to be good and consistent, yesterday was poor at best. Was visiting family and planned on Kindred, but slammed. We were literally 1 of 6 couples that ran into the same issue...kindred....2nd choice Flatiron. You all should plan on this trend to continue and capitalize on it vs fall flat on your face. Hostess was rude, literally watched the bartender break a glass while pouring a beer, the full beer in close proximity was still served. Brussel sprout salad and pretzels were solid but entrees were lackluster. A great location, great town, and a college so easy to rebound all you have to do is try. Don't order the strip (see pic-all fat) or short rib."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with hubby on a Tuesday .  I decided to have the Tuesday special which was a salmon burger and hubby had a regular bacon burger.  The portions here are rather large for the both of us; I ended up taking half my burger home but hubby somehow managed to devour every bite of his food.  Needless to say we both thought the food was great.  Ambiance, service and wait times were all impeccable with nothing but kudos from both of us.  Can't wait to stop in at night for  one of their live music events."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Our party started with fried calamari and then had meatloaf, a burger, and the chicken.  It was all tasty and well prepared. Our server, however, was so inattentive that we thought he had left the building. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I get to DAVIDSON about once a month and stop for lunch or dinner. Kindred is usually my choice, but being that today is Monday, all the restaurants in DAVIDSON are closed except for Flatiron and the soda shop. I picked Flatiron by default for dinner. Given the casual laid-back atmosphere and lack of tablecloth's I was surprised at the price point for the entrées. I chose the wagyu burger and fries. It was medium rare as requested and beautifully season. The flavor was excellent, as well it should be, given the $16 price tag. The service was adequate but nothing to brag about. The beer selection is very good. And on Monday, the restaurant offers a grouping of three dollar beers on tap. My glass of Highland red went well with the burger and fries. In the future I will make sure that my trips to DAVIDSON are on any other day but Monday."}
{"text":"Great selection of local beers - I got a flight of 4 and took my server's suggestion on 2, one of which is officially my new favorite beer.  Unfortunately I'm not sure where to find it in Chicago.  The pretzel appetizer was tasty and original with a small side of cheese fondue for dipping.  The shrimp and grits was delicious, thick and rich, but a bit heavy on the gravy.  Extensive menu - wish I could go back to try more items!    Nice atmosphere; friendly service."}
{"text":"When I'm in the Charlotte area for business (which is often), I make it a point to have at least one meal at the Flatiron. Great local ingredients and interesting flavors, as well as a great beer and wine section. I usually eat at the bar and have a series of small plates. They have some great salads on the menu, and the yukon fries and (not fried) calamari are great. I have also entertained clients there, and it has not failed to please. And, if you are into dessert, try the bag of donut holes... just remember to squeeze the icing inside the donut, not on top. :)"}
{"text":"The service was excellent. Sharon made us feel right at home just the right amount southern hospitality.  The food was excellent, we both had the salmon with risotto. We can't wait until our next trip to see our college kid."}
{"text":"Excellent overall. Very nice inside with a beautiful bar. Food is top notch. Had the hamburger and it was amazing. Beer and wine selection is also great. I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Too bad the owners have had a lapse in judgement. Fired a good chef and hired an inexperienced J&W grad. Probably a good kid, but culinary school (any of them) does NOT make you a chef. That takes time and experience.  Some of the food is now coming precooked and pre packaged, and he's changed established recipes (for the worse, unfortunately). This restaurant is in a great location with great local ingredients available. Such wasted potential."}
{"text":"I so badly wanted to like this place, but disappointed only begins to describe the experience. The hostess was adorable and helpful! (Good!) we were seated, left for 10 mins, before someone came to the table and said, \"hi. What can I get you to drink?\"  Wednesday is apparently $20 bottle of wine night. I asked politely what bottles were included. The waitress turns without a word and brings back a list of wines printed on copy paper and then walks away. Brings water 22 seconds later, and that is the last we see of her. After another 10 mins go by, a place opens at the bar, we move hoping the service will be faster. I almost left without anything-and would have if the bar didn't open up. The bartender was pleasant enough.   Service was slow and on a Wednesday night! Food, adequate at best. Music was fine.   I don't think I had unreasonable expectations---the experience was fine, certainly not good, and will not be returning. I am sad the visit was so bad because I wanted badly to like this place.   Th"}
{"text":"Food was cold and undercooked.  My friend has fish and it was burnt and dry. Waiter was terrible called us buddy. We waited for drinks. Had to ask for extra ice as everything melted. Seldom saw the waiter. Food took forever to get to the table. I would not recommend to anyone.  Wait staff needs to be trained."}
{"text":"Great food, but portions get smaller every year.  If you want a glass of wine you'd better order 4 of them... They did away with the chicken waffles, colossal mistake.  Nice bar and decent beer selections."}
{"text":"NOTE:  Reviewing for bar alone.  Having been to the bar a few times already, I've noticed this is a classy place (classier than me!) that you think should be stuffy, but in reality the bar and staff are fun and pleasant.   Always a drink or food special depending on time and day.  Great selection of beers and a cool setting to sit and chat at the bar.   Give it a try.  Check back later for my dinner review.  UPDATE:  Finally had dinner.  3 of us had steaks and one had seafood.  We were all very impressed with the quality of the meat and interesting sides.  Steaks was cooked perfectly as requested (medium rare) as were the scallops.  The steaks could have been a but hotter, temperature wise, but in true fashion they probably sat after cooking as they should.  I may just be spoiled by warm/hot serving plates.    Overall very impressed with the meal.  Expect to spend $80-100 with tip for 2 people, entrees only, 4 drinks.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant yet!   Very blah food for the price, but even worst than that is the staff....kitchen, wait and managers.  We waited for over an hour for food to come to the table and when it did it was cold and some of it wrong.   We tried to look for our waiter and no where to be found I finally got up to find someone.   Asked very nicely is they could send our waiter or a manager over to the table.  No one ever came but when it was time for a bill you betcha they were right there.  We tried to talk to the waiter about the situation and he said he'd get a manager.   Well we paid the bill and no manager ever came over....oh they walked around us plenty but never stopped.    On the way out we tried to talk to a couple of the manager that were standing around and basically got a \" it sucks to be you \".    We contacted the owner via email becz we did have a reservation at one of his other restaurants in South Charlotte, just to explain that he'd better get over to Flat Iron and speak w/ his manager staff.    We never asked for comp meal or any money back but a mere \"I'm Sorry\" would've been nice.   We got nothing other than a canned response.  We cancelled our other reservation and have to this day NEVER gone back to FLAT IRON in Davidson! I'd  go eat a McDonalds b4 I went back to Flat Iron !!!!!"}
{"text":"A great addition to Davidson. Good experience good drinks good food"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had lunch there for Mothers Day and it was amazing!   It was their dinner menu and we ended up ordering two items each from their apps menu and we couldn't believe how delicious each plate was.  Service was great too.   I live in Davidson and I'm so glad that this restaurant has become what it is today."}
{"text":"In the past, we have had perfectly nice meals here.  The steaks are good and there is a great beer selection.  The seafood is also good and I can recommend the flounder and the salmon, both of which are delicious.  My fiance had the filet which was cooked very well.    On this particular night however, there was horrible live music.  Normally I am not too affected by the music in a restaurant, but this performer was singing his heart out and occassionally screaming into the microphone.  At these times, the noise was unbearable and conversation was impossible.    We talked to our waitress about how terrible the music was and requested that it be turned down.  She apologized profusely, and passed on the apologies of the owner, but nevertheless the music continued and was just absolutely the worst music for the meal.    If I was in a bar, it might have been acceptable.  Not during a nice dinner at an upscale restaurant on a WEDNESDAY.    Whether or not the owner was apologetic, the music wasn't turned down and we received no apologies from anyone besides the waitress.  I feel bad for the waitstaff that they are forced to work for tips in such an environment.    Totally, totally, totally unacceptable!  Learn how to run a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not so good Expensive for what you get.  You get a Better value at other places near by. Nice venue though."}
{"text":"This is our favorite cozy restaurant in Davidson!...great bar, with rotating craft beer tower, impeccable, attentive service, and the chef's creations are both beautifully presented and delicious...favorites are...fresh mussels with coconut curry sauce or red sauce & garlic, warm brussel sprouts salad, fresh salmon, shrimp & grits, diver scallops...all fresh and farm to table...all around, an excellent experience!"}
{"text":"Brittany our server was amazing! Dealt with my picky husband and more! The hostesses Emily and Rachel were So sweet and gave us a great Table For our birthday celebration, and the manager Jason stopped by to make sure everything was perfect. Food excellent scallops done perfectly, safe room for the bread pudding!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant! The food was outstanding and they brought us a free dessert for our anniversary!  We would definitely go back in a heartbeat. Thanks for a memorable dinner!"}
{"text":"Flatiron is a great addition to the rather nonexistent Davidson dining scene. Its in a great location and the atmosphere is fabulous. I have only been for lunch but I will certainly be back for dinner. Upscale lunch can be difficult to find but Flatiron offers lunch fare done really well at a very reasonable price. They offer a huge selection of appetizers so its also a perfect spot to grab a drink and nosh on some small plates. I would suggest making a reservation, dining at one of the only restaurants in Davidson has its downsides."}
{"text":"My friend and I sat at the bar on Monday night.  The service was a little slow (overworked) but friendly.  The artender allowed us to sample a couple of wines that we were considering.  The wagyu crustini appetizer was very tasty.  We ordered the butcher's tenderloin at medium.  Unfortunately, it came out rare.  The raspberry cheesecake was delicious."}
{"text":"Like this place. Traditional, high quality. Wish they had breakfast. Great location, not busy"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was poor. It took 10 minutes to get served at the bar. Then our food came out one plate at a time. The Manager brought one salad, then after another 10 minutes He brought the second salad. He then brought me 2 sliders when I ordered 3. He said that he would get the third slider. We were done with our meals and the rest of our meal was not complete. The third burger was ready after we asked for the check. The server asked if we wanted desert and we said no and asked if we wanted to box up the 3rd burger and we said no.We were never asked if everything was good or ok. We seen the manager asked other tables about their meals, but never came back to us. We seen home go back to his office. The bar was 1/3 full around 8:15 pm on a Thursday evening. This was the 2nd time this happened. The other time was the Thursday evening of Christmas in Davidson in 2014. We will not return!"}
{"text":"Accommodated our large party of 8 adults and 2 kids very well for lunch. Good menu all around."}
{"text":"First time here.  Had friends recommend it to us.  Great location and moderately busy on a Monday evening.  Made a reservation on Open Table about 2 hours head of time, but probably didn't need it on a Monday night.  Great beer and cocktail selection.  Server was a little stiff but took good care of us.  Manager brought out or appetizers and he was great at engaging with us.  Had both the grilled octopus and the fries with truffle oil and parmesan.  Both were amazing!  My wife was a little apprehensive about the octo but loved it. She ordered the chicken with barley and brussel sprouts  and I had the scallops.  Both dishes came out piping hot and were amazing.  Service was great and we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Great burger (the Bistro Burger) and service was solid.  More focus on fresh and local would be nice.  It is a place I will return to."}
{"text":"Loved the shrimp and grits and great beer selection.  Also, they found out it was our anniversary and really took care of us."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. Every time I eat here the portions get smaller. Tinier. Well except for the prices. They even managed to shrink the 6 dollar stout to 6 ounces."}
{"text":"We actually came here when a different restaurant was too busy - but this was by far the better choice! We enjoyed delicious wine and food in an atmosphere that was just noisy enough but not loud. The flavors are bold and salty, and the seafood was executed perfectly. The service was excellent, and empty dishes were cleared away seamlessly before we were aware. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Welcome to our second edition of Excited about Eating located on our new site! Thanks for sticking with us during our \"moving\" phase.  This week we're featuring Flatiron Kitchen and Taphouse in Davidson, NC.  This neighborhood eatery, located at the fork on Main, offers a variety of salads, sandwiches, and entrees, and a daily special.  For our starter, we chose the Taphouse Pretzel, served with white cheddar fondue and house mustard. The pretzel was outstanding,  and when dipped in the white cheddar fondue, I just don't see how it could be any better.  Dora here. I agree.  I love pretzels with the traditional mustard accompaniment, but I could've chowed down on five of these smothered in the white cheddar BY MYSELF. Yum!  I chose the Fish & Chips, beer-battered haddock, remoulade and malt vinegar served with fries. Unlike other fish with heavy batter, this fish was lightly battered so the taste of the fish shined through. The fish was tender and flaky, and the fries were fresh, crispy, and shoestring, my favorite. Great!  Dora here. The BBQ Blue Cheese Burger looked so pretty, I almost hesitated to dig in. But I was anxious to try the Wagyu beef, supposedly \"the finest quality of beef available in the United States\" and \"highly prized for their rich flavor,\" according to the American Wagyu Association. The burger sported a nice char, but it wasn't packed with flavor like I expected. Overall, nothing extraordinary. A bit of a letdown considering the pretzel.:)  Great vibe in the restaurant, though, and such a friendly waitstaff. We'll definitely be back to try out some of the other items calling our names from the menu.   We rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies http://bit.ly/1Xn4T27"}
{"text":"So happy to finally give this local hometown spot five stars! Lunch yesterday was amazing! The fish tacos the best I've ever had and the chicken wrap the same! Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Can a restaurant be delightful and underwhelming at the same time?  I received a gift card for Flat Iron for my birthday (even though I'm a vegetarian)...  Other than a few of the appetizers and a couple small salads the menu didn't have a single vegetarian item. However, to my delight, the website boasted a dinner menu \"featuring nightly seafood, vegetarian, and steak specials\"... This was NOT the case. The only special was seafood. Now I'm stuck with a salad, BUGGER OFF.  So, considering the name of the restaurant denotes that it serves a wide selection of beer I asked our server what they had a tap that was or similar to a hefeweizen. Not only did he seem perplexed by my question, but open scouring the drink menu there wasn't a single thing. UGH. I settled for a pale Belgium.  The only other thing I was looking forward to was the appetizers. I had two items I picked out online that I was lusting over on the way there. To my dismay, there were out of the Pretzels with White Cheddar Fondue. COME ON. So we ordered the Goat Cheese Bake (as planned) and the Tap-house Fries (impromptu). Happily, they were both really, really yum-o.  The waiter was accommodating and let me build my own salad since I didn't like the only 2 veggie-friendly salad menu listings. The salad was good, but some of the greens weren't very fresh (off putting). On the other hand, my omnivorous boyfriend ordered the Double R Ranch Rib-eye and was basically on CLOUD 9.  We had the raspberry cheesecake for dessert, which had a great texture and flavor.  In regards to atmosphere, the interior of Flat Iron is really charming. Hardwood floors, industrial fixtures and accents. With a quirky, unconventional layout. The hostesses and server were very nice.   I probably won't make the trek back out here until they add more consistent veg friendly menu items."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful night at Flatiron last night! This was our 3rd or 4th visit, but so far the best. I love the atmosphere and attention to detail that the restaurant has. We were seated promptly and had great service throughout the evening.  I ordered the mussels as my main course and a salad as a starter. Both were excellent--I loved the vinaigrette on the salad, and was pleased with the freshness of the greens. The mussels were by far the best  I've had in Charlotte--a green curry sauce with cilantro really complemented them. My dining companion had the trout, which he thoroughly enjoyed. We finished with the creme brulee, which was a nice end to a pleasant meal. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had lunch here today. The Salmon and spinach grill. Excellent. It was so good. The server team were outstanding. We are on low carb diets and this meal was just what we needed."}
{"text":"First time here. Always seems busy so either must be good or just looks that way. Love the arrangement with the bar in the center and open directly to the kitchen. Hoping for a decent cocktail, I'd stay away from the proseco + bourbon concoction and just order a real whiskey drink. However their Paloma is a close second place mezcal cocktail to Kindred's version up the road.  My review comes from the bar which seems like the place to sit whereas the hostesses have no concept of time and said the wait would be an hour for a table.   Bar staff was super helpful with our order and very attentive which automatically biases my score at any place. We ordered the duck breast and a steak with a salad. Definitely fresh and the steak was actually grilled, which added great flavor to every bite.  While this place isn't heaven on earth, the food and drinks at the bar will certainly help grease the wheels to get your night off to a good start."}
{"text":"The food was a disappointment, because the ambiance was nice.  Ordered some sandwiches, and a steak wrap.  All was just okay.  Too expensive as well for the food."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are WAY too small.  Ordered the Pork Chop to go - $26 and literally got 2 tablespoons worth of the sides (grits and Brussels sprouts).   The flavor was delicious and pork chop was great too. The side dishes were great but extremely lacking in size for that price. We have eaten in and were equally unimpressed with the portions for the amount of money.  Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Chef Bill just has that IT factor! Every time Eva and I have eaten there we leave knowing we experienced something really special. We always sit at the bar, the bartenders are excellent, the manager knows his bourbons. From the diver scallops to the coffee rubbed organic ribeye, there really isn't anything on Chef Bill's menu that is not carefully thought thru and paired with exceptional sides. They have a fantastic wine selection and the best part is all of the staff seem happy to be there. With it having an open kitchen, the smells alone will make your mouth water. If you're in Davidson NC, wanting a five star meal without the stuffiness some fine dining establishments have, then Flat Iron is definitely for you!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there last night after a trip to a gallery.  We had no expectations as we do not live in the area.  Decor is pretty cool.  Very sharp designer with some very clever ideas. Menu is laid out well and was logical. Pricing stated we were in a finer place. Central open kitchen stated it was Chef driven.  Taste said the Chef was on vacation. Pretzel apps were nice presentation, great cheese sauce but over cooked. I got the Shrimp and Grits.  The stone ground grits were ruined by a taso sauce that was just awful.  Pet peeve here:  If you are doing a dish with shrimp in it... take the tails off!  This dish was not good.  I actually see how it could be good, but not this night.... and not $18 Wife got the Chicken Salad.  It was not an eye appealing dish.  Blue Cheese dictated the taste.  Once again, price was inappropriate.  Had their hand made donuts.  Presentation is awesome! And clever.  Taste is good and only put off by the fact that they were overcooked on the outside and undercooked on the inside.    Nut shell.  No way would I go back.  Pricing is grossly vulgar for the quality of the food.  EDIT NOTE: Server was great as was service."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere in this place. Only been on Wednesdays but always have sweet live music. Food is yum yum and I haven't been disappointed with their beer list."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Davidson and Lake Norman area! Great wine tasting once a month and food is always fabulous! Awesome service and very knowledgeable sommelier!!!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent.  The food, not so good!  Not enough flavor in the scallop dish.  Who makes shrimp & grits with spinach?  The flavor was not good.  The flavors did not meld in both of the dishes.  Did not like them!  The price point was high for the quality of food.  The wine is priced higher than comparable restaurants.  I won't return there and if I do, I'll just get a burger.  It looked good!"}
{"text":"I'm becoming increasingly intolerant of tomato salads described as with cheese arriving with little to none. It's happened in my home town and happened again recently at FlatIron. Both times I expected the \"heirloom\" tomatoes to be in short supply because of the lateness of the season, but had no hesitation about the cheese. Boy, was I wrong. Apparently it's cheese that's not available in the fall - multicolored tomatoes appear to abound!  Beyond that, the food was ok, but nothing to really write home about. Kind of average, with small portions for the price point and quality and flavor. Service was average. We'd tried to get into three other places, but all were packed - FlatIron was not, which is always a bit of a clue.   But lots of unique beer selections, so if you're into that, head on in!"}
{"text":"I am a food snob. If I got out anywhere for food and drinks it will be because they have better access to ingredients and/or they can do a better job of cooking than me. Well Flatiron has dine both. I have been there three times in a month and have tried different combinations each time. This is an excellent place to eat and highly recommend it. Service great! Food great! Location great!"}
{"text":"Another great meal tonight at our fav place in Davidson...mussels were excellent with a new sauce with chillies,  but by far, the nightly special of wild stripped bass, pan seared with mushrooms,  bok choy, fingerling potatoes and a lime citrus sauce was absolutely delicious!...looking forward to coming back soon !!"}
{"text":"While in the Charlotte area, we thought we'd try the Flatiron for dinner. We arrived around 7 and we're greeted at the door by 2 hostesses who opened the double doors for us. Great service I thought. Downhill from there. They were having a wine tasting at that hour and could not seat us for 20 minutes. Ok - but there were tables available. No matter, we went out for a walk. When we were finally seated, service was slow. Now I'm not a chef, but to our taste, the food had way too much salt added to it - so in our opinion, the establishment failed to impress us from the kitchen and from the wait staff. Two stars is being generous. We won't be back."}
{"text":"After moving to the lake area a couple months ago, and trying their amazing brunch this place was on my to go list for dinner. So I chose to go with a bunch of family and friends for my birthday dinner. First and foremost the atmosphere is super cool, swanky yet relaxing at the same time. With a good beer and wine selection aside, the menu is what grabbed my attention. Very simple, yet they have some of the best and freshest ingredients. During my initial trip for brunch I had their wagyu burger with their fries. The burger was perfectly cooked, and oh so flavorful. That lead me up to having their wagyu flatiron steak for dinner the night of my birthday. It came over Brussell sprouts and whipped garlic potatoes. It was tastey to say the least. However, everyone's meals looked amazing. I was lucky enough to try the duck and the seared tuna and both were equally delish. Definitely recommend going for brunch, lunch, or dinner for any even or for just a night out."}
{"text":"Loved it! We had just walked out of a restaurant before we came here because no one waited on us, so we were already on a roll about how easy good customer service should be. The hostess opened the door for us and seated us quickly and just as quickly a waitress came and took our drink order. She was knowledgeable about the menu, accommodating when I wanted to tweak an item on the menu. The food was fantastic and my husband and I ate every single bite!! Loved loved loved it !!!! Also, the manager was all over the place making sure things were in order, this place knows how to do it right!!"}
{"text":"Very good service, great food. I had a grass fed burger with an egg on top, new for me, the fries were scrumptious. Place is on a noisier side but large enough to accommodate groups or couples. A bit pricey on the steak selections but they are grass fed. I am happy to support local farming. Not everything on the menu is local. Octopus is from Portugal. Still a great place to eat for a spoiled like me New Yorker."}
{"text":"We came to FlatIron to celebrate Easter with my in-laws in Davidson, on a recommendation from my sister-in-law.   We looked at the menu beforehand so we knew about what we wanted. We decided to try the calamari for an appetizer and it was very good! They are strips of thick cut calamari with a great warm dipping sauce. If you like more crunchy calamari, I would say this isn't for you, because there is a lot less breading than most places.   For my entree I got the grilled chicken sandwich with bacon and Gouda, and the garlic aoli sauce on the side, with sweet potato fries. The sauce was SOOOOO good. I don't really mayonnaise based sauces, but I think this could go on anything. I even took home a container. The only thing I would change about the sandwich would be to toast the bread.   Our waitress was very good. She was attentive and patient, which is a must have for our group.   I thought the wine was a little pricey. I got the Purple Cowboy for $8 a glass, which I think was the least expensive. Good wine, just a little more than I would prefer to pay.   Also I think parking might be an issue during the week. We parked on the side of the building, but those spots are reserved M-F."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Good Vegan options. Edemame hummus was excellent as was veggie wrap with fries. Pork tacos were dry and boring but fish tacos made up for it."}
{"text":"While the menu is a little small, the food is good and the prices are very good. They have a beautiful bar in the center of the restaurant. There are large windows which help with natural light. The servers are all very friendly and knowledgable about the menu.  None of the appetizers really sounded unique. We decided to start with a cup of the soup of the day, which was lobster bisque. We enjoyed it, but I wished they served it with some bread or croutons.   I went with the salmon over barley and spinach for lunch. You get a pretty big serving size for the price, so I was happy about that. My husband ordered the Philly Cheesesteak with sweet potato fries. I actually felt like it was odd to see a Philly Cheesesteak on the menu, as this place seems a little fancier, but it was good, nonetheless. I'd love to know if the sweet potato fries are handcut, because they did seem frozen. Flatiron does use produce and meats from many local farms, which is very respectable. They do one special each day of the week, which is a good deal and very cost efficient.   I would definitely come back for lunch or dinner. They also have an impressive wine and cocktail menu."}
{"text":"Terrible experience all around.  Called manager and was offered a substantial gift card to try it again.  He seemed eager to alleviate my concerns and fix problems so I am thinking I may have just caught them on a bad night.....Update is coming."}
{"text":"We come to FlatIron several times every month. It's one of our favorite restaurants in LKN. The food is always great and the services is exceptional. The grilled octopus or deviled egg appetizers are a must!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here three times: first two times, good; third time, not so much. Went for lunch and was told the soup was chicken chili. Expected a robust soup with beans and chicken, but got a thin broth with nothing much in it. Disappointing. No crackers and they charge $2 for two pieces of bread. But, again, the first two times we are here the food was good; hopefully, they'll ensure their soups are up to snuff."}
{"text":"Epic fail!! 15 dollars for a salad...where is the chicken???? Nothing special in it.  Plain spinach, too shy to give out the tomatoes and feta?!! Its a salad, dont be cheap chef! The burger was a good size, the egg was raw and I had to pay a dollar extra for it on the price of $15....really....no. hickory tavern is way better and I don't have to wait an eternity. Maybe your chef should eat at whiskey warehouse to learn about good bar food."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere in the center of Davidson. Interesting menu with a blend for everyones interest."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, the first time I had the caesar salad with grilled shrimp and it was delicious.  Specifically came back a second time to order that salad again, and it was DELICIOUS.   Love it. Love it. Love it.  Must come back and actually try something else, but now that I'm thinking about it, all I want is the caesar with grilled shrimp..."}
{"text":"WOW!  Just had the Crispy Portuguese Octopus.  It was AMAZING......the octopus was crispy, the sweetness of the pineapple added just the right touch and the spicy but not too hot chipotle dressing was just right.  Will definitely order this dish again.  Just one recommendation, please try serving your starters in a smaller container.  More eco friendly and less wasteful.    Love, Loved this appetizer."}
{"text":"On a recent stay in Davidson, NC we visited Flatiron Kitchen & Taphouse. We were so impressed with the service, the food and the entire experience. In fact we were so impressed that we returned the very next evening. We were not disappointed. Maureen was our server the first night and she was spot on with all of her recommendations. We were so impressed with Maureen that we specifically asked for her the second night. The first night we started with a bottle of the Super Tuscan wine. Wednesday evenings they have a wine special of $25 for any bottles $34 and under. We chose mussels for our starter. They were so amazing. I had the scallops and my husband had the pork chop, which happened to be the special that night. Both entrees were very good. We ended the evening with the pound cake with raspberry compote and lemon. Very Good!  The next evening we chose the same wine, the same seats and the same server, just because we wanted the same experience as a the night before. It was that good! We were not disappointed. For our starter we got the special, which was mushrooms over mashed potatoes with an over easy egg on top. It was very different and unique but very good. For entrees I had the chicken and my husband had the duck. Both were excellent. For desert we had the chocolate mousse. Another wonderful dining experience!  We will definitely return to the Flatiron the next time we are in town. I highly recommend Flatiron for your next dining experience."}
{"text":"Recently, I made a reservation at Flatiron for Mother's Day Brunch -8 people.  Yesterday I received a phone call from them explaining that the menu will be \"adjusted\" to a reduced dinner menu, entrees priced from $18 - $40.  I cancelled my reservation.  While I respect Flatiron for having the decency to telephone everyone and let them know, I see this as nothing more than \"polite price gouging\" and taking advantage of a day where people are just looking to do something nice for their mothers.  I will make sure to avoid Flatiron in the future."}
{"text":"My other half and I absolutely LOVE this place. Chef Bill is a master at his craft and seems to have a sincere interest in the customer receiving a premier dining experience every time. General Manager, Jason, is extremely personable and makes a point to thank us for our business each time we dine there. 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Always good food and friendly staff. It's never super busy which is only odd thing but we may have gone at odd hours."}
{"text":"Well, food and beer was good, although the $35 steak was cold when served.   I made a reservation through open table, which was cancelled on my arrival even though the place was empty.  Many other fine restaurants in the area.   I would skip this one as they do not seem to passionate about taking care of their customers.  Not sure why my reservation was cancelled.  But, regardless, food was average at best, and pricey considering the quality."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and atmosphere!  This is our favorite go to place.  If you have not been here or it has been a while you are missing out."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I would not recommend this establishment. We waited an hour to be served, which didn't bother either of us--it's Friday night and we expected it to be busy. However, when the food arrived it was room temperature. After about five minutes of neither of us eating, our server came and asked us how it was. Upon hearing that it was cold, he politely apologized and took our plates. Unfortunately, when our plates came back, the food was warm at best. They didn't make new food (this was clear as the plates looked exactly as they had when they left the table). Again our server returned and told us he would comp the meal. They still charged us for the drinks we had. They seem more concerned with getting us out of the restaurant than with our happiness.   In summary, we received the same cold food twice and left an hour and a half later still hungry. Worst experience I've ever had in a Charlotte restaurant."}
{"text":"Look I know probably most of you reading this review just want to hear about the restaurant and not my totally irrelevant personal story that accompanies it, so I'll get that out of the way first. The calamari was chewy. The appetizers sounded more appealing than the entrees. I got a $14 burger that made me turn into that old lady saying WHERE'S THE BEEF (no, older friends, I'm not old enough to actually remember that but I saw it on I love the 80s). The Manhattan was delicious. Their beers aren't bad. Feel free to continue on to the other reviews for more information about how your food will taste or whatever.  The rest of this review is dedicated to the French waiter who served us. His style of serving is to tear you down only so he can build you back up.  I first order a Manhattan, and he leaves to put our orders in. Then he comes back to the table and asks if I wanted the Manhattan up, to which I replied, \"Actually can I change my order to one of these beers?\" His response: exaggerated sigh/eyeroll, goes over to the bar and a few minutes later comes back to tell me \"The bartender already made the drink\" so I guess that meant I was SOL! My response: \"So? Pour it down the fucking sink and give me a beer, a-hole!\" Except that was what I said to my friends when he left and to the waiter I said \"Ok, I will take it!\" Admittedly, I could have been more assertive, but whatever this is not an essay about my shortcomings as a human being, ok?  Then when I ordered the burger, the waiter kind of laughed. And by kind of, I mean he BLATANTLY LAUGHED IN MY FACE. I guess I don't really \"get\" humor, but I didn't see why that was really amusing. Did he want to know how I wanted it cooked? Nah. So I sort of mumbled \"I'd like that medium well or, you know, however the cook back there feels like cooking it, so...hey should I go fuck myself? Okay, I'll just go fuck myself.\" My friend James was convinced that the waiter must have heard me calling him an a-hole and he was also worried the waiter was going to pee in our food.   So at this point, I've determined the waiter and I are mortal enemies. And then he comes to the table and asked me how many waters I was trying to drink at once, and I realized I had been drinking James' water. And the waiter totally made fun of me for it, and I'm sure it's one of those \"you had to be there\" things but it was funny. Maybe it's because I'm a self-loathing masochist, but I love when people can metaphorically rub my face in my own shit like a dog and really give me a hard time. This is why I like people who are at least as funny and as smart as fucking ME, and although these people are rare I embrace them like Lenny embraces small animals and women in Of Mice and Men. I love dishing it out, but when people give it back to me and can do it well, I am putty in their hands.  Thus the ice was broken, and I was kind of skeptical that this guy's funny French accent was real, so I asked, \"Ou sont les toilettes?\" Which means \"Where is the toilet?\" in French. He stared at me for about 5 seconds and I thought \"A-HA! This guy who says he's from Paris (sure, guy!) and now lives in effin' Troutman (the 'not-rich part') is a fraud!\" And then he responded in French that it was next to the kitchen, and then he again made fun of me for taking so many years of French in school all for pretty much that moment, to ask him where the bathroom was. We then somehow got into a very lengthy discussion about the Tour de France and my idiot friend James, who apparently is a Tour de France buff, kept wanting to prolong the conversation until Faith and I got bored and the waiter told us to come back for a drink after the movie we were going to see, but that never happened because that was just a bad one night stand waiting to happen. I did give him a little over 20% tip though. I know this is a really long review, but I'm making up for the fact that the last one was one sentence."}
{"text":"Stopped in Davidson on a Monday night after deciding to grab some dinner versus sitting in traffic on Interstate 77.  I sat at the bar & received very efficient service. Not long after ordering my corn and potato chowder arrived in a nice big bowl. It was extremely tasty, Will be wanting this soup again when cold weather returns!  For my entrée I ordered the meatloaf with Redskin mashed potatoes. Large portion of both & it too was very yummy!   Nice ambience with many locals, will definitely stop here in future visits to Davidson."}
{"text":"My team had an excellent experience at FlatIron Kitchen & Taphouse.  I brought a very large team (~25 people) to FlatIron for Happy Hour and dinner and everyone was extremely happy.  The service, beer, and food were all excellent.  The Bar Tenders were all very attentive and the beer selection was excellent.  When we were sat for food, we originally had about 20 people and slowly more people started trickling in.  The staff quickly adjusted to the new people by adding more tables and getting the new guys whatever they needed.  Very much appreciated.  The food was seriously excellent, the staff was great, and honestly...the bill was shockingly low for that # of people.  So...we'll 100% be back."}
{"text":"We came here back in the winter. Food was pricey but excellent. Very good deviled eggs.The bar is beautiful and they had an excellent selection of beer and wine. Service was a little slow but we were in no hurry."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I have been here a few times, and decided to bring our parents here to meet. The staff is wonderful and the food is consistently great. And it's run by Davidson grads! It's a great day to be a wild"}
{"text":"Ok  here's the deal.  First, our table was near the door and it was 30 degrees that night, bad.  Second,  the wedge salad was awful.  Third, they forgot the appetizer and to end it off, they gave my wife the wrong entree so she had to eat by herself for the most part.  The food, however, was very good.  Needless  to say, this is the first and last time I will dine here."}
{"text":"Very good service.   Wagyu burger was excellent, cooked as ordered.   Very nice atmosphere.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner Friday evening. Ate at bar as we did not have reservation. It was a casual atmosphere.   First time there so decided on salad and burger. Food was very good.  People we knew had scallops and said excellent. Manager went to people next to us to ask how the food was and walked right past us. Did think that was rude.  But Would definitely go back for food."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting Flatiron and I was not disappointed! We ordered the deviled eggs, Parmesan truffle fries, Atlantic salmon, and fettuccine. Everything tasted great and the service was good as well."}
{"text":"It's a gorgeous Sunday afternoon and Davidson is bustling with people.  We walked around to all the other restaurants on Main Street and they were really busy.  So before deciding where to go we walked across the street  to Flatiron.  We should have walked right back out. There was a good reason Flatiron was empty at 12:30-1:30.    I ordered the chicken sandwich and asked for it to be blackened, with a side of seasonal vegetables.  The sandwich arrived in a short time.  The chicken wasn't blackened as far as I could tell; the portion size was just ok. The bacon was great as was the bread.  The tomato was cut thick, slight greenish tint with the \"core\" in the center...really??  My vegetables were in a cup with brocolini and pea pods on top .  Under that was a bowl of onions and the whole thing was swimming in grease.  Needless to say theY were not eaten.  The waitress didn't come back to check on us for a while. Almost got up to asked her to bring catsup, but she showed up with water.    As we were leaving there was a man (host, manager?) standing at the desk area at the door talking to our waitress.  It would have been nice for a \"have a nice day\", \"hope you'll join us again\",  \"bye\"....anything.  We got nothing.    Upon leaving there were 4 people on the other side of the restaurant and two outside. They'll need to step up their game if they're going to continue to be successful in a very competitive Davidson restaurant scene."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and it's been great both times. They have a good selection of local craft beers and the food is always fresh. We've had great service both times. We've tried the shrimp and grits and the salmon and both are excellent. Small menu which probably means nothing is frozen. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Drink the beer, but don't eat the food! Great beer selection, but the food is consistently poor. 3rd time I've left dissatisfied from this place and will never come back again.  During our last visit we had two chicken dishes where the chicken was pink inside. They replaced the meals and comped only one. The manager did not appear to be apologetic or concerned. The other meals were just alright and overpriced. There are enough other great places around to have to put up with overpriced incosistent food and service at Flatiiron."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 or 4 times in maybe 2 years and never have great experience.  Sandwich had wilted piece of iceberg lettuce, soggy bun the bacon was  almost raw. No flavor.  Fries were soggy and cold.  Waitress seemed impatient.   The place has nice decor and great location but I could name 5 places that have a better lunch ."}
{"text":"Easter Sunday brunch was all you can eat, but not a buffet. The deviled egg appetizers were delicious; we had seconds. Nice selection of entrees, and the mini dessert tray was enjoyed by all. This was a very nice sit-down alternative to the crowded buffet lines."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this review short and kinda nondescript....kinda like my experience at Flatiron...nothing special.  It wasn't good, it wasn't bad and parking was a bitch.  I mean seriously what the heck is with that 'all compact car, but somehow people wedged landcruisers into it' parking garage?  Anywho...  I went there for Sunday Brunch....knowing from jump the brunch offerings were limited.  I ended up going for the burger.  It was good.  Both my girlfriend and I asked for medium well....we got well done.  That didn't bug me b/c I prefer a more well done burger, but I could see that as annoying to some.  The sweet potato fries were good, but again....the whole meal was meh...and when it was all said and done I was down 20 bucks.  So it seemed kinda pricey for a burger and fries and soda.  I guess I'd go back again, but I dunno.  It was just nothing special, but not bad.  There's more to try in Davidson, so I think if I went back it would be after I've eaten at EVERY other Davidson joint...so suffice it to say it's gonna be awhile.    If I had to say one negative - the service, our waitress was lovely and nice, but kinda scarce.  I think she took our Sunday afternoon brunch w/ the ladies seriously.  She left us the hell alone.  That was cool, but at a certain point it'd be nice to get a 'how you doing' so you could ask for refill etc."}
{"text":"Now I am going to start this by saying I went into this a bit biased. The reason I say this is because my husband was the contractor for this restaurant so we wanted to see the finished project with people inside. Well let me say the atmosphere of this place doesn't disappoint. The details inside are just amazing. The restaurant is not huge so it does fill up pretty fast and it can get pretty noisy. We got there at 7:00 and had to wait for about 30 minutes, but we were able to get 2 seats at the bar. The bar in this place is amazing. They have a beer sampler for $6, which was AWESOME! A great way to try some of their beer selection without having to drink a whole glass of something you don't like...not that I would ever let beer go to waste! I did find a beer that I really liked, which I probably would not have ordered if it were not for the sampler. We got the goat cheese appetizer that was served with homemade chips...my mouth is watering just thinking about it! The waiter had to bring us more chips it was so good. I had the burger and fries...I know, why did I order a burger in a steak house...but I love burgers and it was pretty darn good. My husband opted for the meatloaf, which was good but he probably should have ordered a steak instead. Our next trip we will definitely try steak since it IS a steak house."}
{"text":"Sat down at the bar tonight and never got asked for drinks or food for over 15 mins. Only about 10 people at the bar.  Terrible service."}
{"text":"Service was slow, steak quality was below average. Desserts were the best part.  The waitress insisted I keep my dirty salad fork for my entree."}
{"text":"We tried this place on Sunday evening during restaurant week and were disappointed with the food. Ambience is nice though. It was barely half full. The four of us ordered off the restaurant week menu. The pretzel, crabcake and hummus starters were average. Three beef medallions were ordered medium well. They were dry and a couple pieces were charred.  The salmon was the only exception and was very good. For dessert, the creme brulee texture was lumpy and it was way too sugary. Emailed the restaurant but never heard back.  Overall, they did not win any new customers from this visit."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch around 1, busy but were seated promptly, ordered the Monday special \"crab cakes \" , after a few minutes we were told they were sold out. Ordered fish and chips; hard , thin, very greasy, small portion more batter than fish. French fries with garlic Parmesan were delivered cold after waiting 25 minutes for food. Reordered and they were really good. Service was good. Sad lunch"}
{"text":"The food here is very good burgers are great chops are great have never really had a bad meal at this restaurant I will agree that the prices are a little high for the area however you get very good food for what you pay for portions could be a little bit bigger but you do get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. It was the first time visiting. The lunch selection is good and the service was excellent. I would recommend the salmon served over barley and sautéed spinach."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Service excellent! Food I can't even begin to tell you how good the Salmon is on the menu!!!! Highly recommended!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty restaurant. Nice attentive service but the food has no pizzazz. This was my third visit. I got the calamari and a salad. The calamari was thick and chewy ... Not crispy and the sauce on it was bland. They left off the bacon and I believe the even the vinaigrette dressing. It was the most tasteless salad I've ever eaten. The wine was the only way I got this food down! :("}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a few people, I'd say overall not too bad. I do think it's a little overpriced however, our total for dinner was over $300 for 4 adults and 1 kids meal (1 adult didn't eat, 1 ordered a veggie plate). I had the salmon which was good. However, I thought it was odd that the runner that brought the salmon dishes said that it was a \"foam that doesn't really taste of anything, most people think it's soap but it's not, it's just supposed to look cool.\" Not a big fan of putting stuff in an entree just to look cool, I tried it, it def tastes of truffle, but ended up just spooning it off to the side (as did a lot of people at tables around us). The service was a little lackluster as well, we ordered the kids meal earlier since we were waiting on someone, it was never put in, and then asked to be re ordered and came out with all the entrees, leaving a hungry kid waiting kinda sucks. I think the last thing that was a little unnerving also was as we got up to leave, the kitchen door was behind our table, and I saw a cook sitting on the floor eating a plate of food? Never seen that before, I'd imagine it's not very sanitary ?."}
{"text":"Food, in general, was excellent.   Salads are amazing - kale and  brussel sprout were great.   Cheese plate was super skimpy for $14. Definitely pick a different appetizer.   Entrees were fantastic- scallops and linguini were among the best. Pasta was fresh made for sure.   Desserts were okay but not blockbuster.   Service was all over the place. Sometimes it was attentive and sometimes it was non existent. Not sure what was up with that.   Now for the most important- beer. They had some really good selections like Alagash White. And the expected local beers. Good stuff."}
{"text":"We arrived in Davidson very hungry and based on other Yelp reviews we decided to try Flatiron. We were greeted and seated promptly and the server was attentive, however thats where the positives end. We inquired about some of the menu entrees and the meatloaf was highly recommended so 2 of us ordered that, and the other 2 got the burger. It took some time for the food to arrive and during our wait no bread or anything is offered. The meatloaf was presented on a white plate with a lump of fairly stiff flavorless mashed potatoes (also white) and the meatloaf  which is wrapped in a pastry shell (also white) . So as I dig in to this color free dish hoping for a tasty first bite to overcome the boring visual effect. I am dissappointed, but my hunger won over and I finished the meal rather than send it back. The Waygu beef had no flavor and was very dry, there was a scant amount of sauce but not enough to save this dish. The burger was slightly better but also over cooked and dry. The onions on the burger were good and the fries were the highlight the dinner. So after $100 we left, not hungry and not happy :( next trip to Davidson we will try a different restaurant."}
{"text":"I've tried to like this place.  I like the look of it and the location.  But the food is mediocre and the service my last time... awful.  Food brought out was not what I ordered.  Bartender got in an argument with my girlfriend on her drink preference.  A lot of details I'm leaving out, but we are not hard to get along with.  We just happened to have a bartender with attitude.  When we sat down, the guy already at the bar was leaving and we noticed he left the bartender a $1 tip on a large order.  I should've known then.  I'd be happy to talk to management rather than leave a review, but I have not heard back."}
{"text":"So went out for a night out which are few and far between due to being in the industry myself. Our meal was absolutely fantastic we started with lobster rissoto seasoned to perfection with large pieces of delicately cooked lobster folded in topped with fresh pepper and sea salt Amazing.We split the appetizer and it was the perfect size. For entrees I had the special which was beautifully seared black grouper over charred cream corn and roasted tomatoes with rrp puree delicious 10/10. My girlfriend had wonderfully seared scallops over corn with a piquillo pepper sauce another winner. We will return best food around Charlotte hands down"}
{"text":"Upon moving to NC, FlatIron has become my go to Friday night dinner and drink spot. The appetizers are always a treasure and the constantly changing menu keeps things fresh. A must-visit!"}
{"text":"Reservation set for a date to be sat near a bunch of kids. Two tables pushed together unevenly causing a drink to get spilt. Waitress acted as if scared of us and was quick to get away...also inattentive. Pretzel app was as if dry pretzel was sprayed with grease and cheese dip was extremely bland and runny. It was nice to be able to swap entree sides, risotto was bland but pork chop, potatoes and carrots were good. Chocolate mouse pie with mango salsa needs chunks in salsa to taste better together."}
{"text":"Finally gave Flatiron a try after living nearby since It opened. The good:great ambiance and vibe, with lots of things going on including an open kitchen; beer samplers available from their many beers on tap; a great fresh salad to start; scallops from the NC coast and a delicious red velvet cupcake for dessert. The subpar: we also ordered the signature steak dish and it wasn't very, well tasty. Could cook better on the grill at home. It was accompanied by a hash dish that seemed a little gloppy. So great seafood and salad and beer....maybe it was a bad night on steak and hash."}
{"text":"Restaurant has a spacious vibe with a mix of high & low top tables seating 2-4. Full bar with a small selection of specialty cocktails. Large windows abound which bring in great natural light as well as a venue for good people watching as a secondary caveat to the meal.  Grilled Octopus with potatoes, capers, onions & potato foam was an excellent concept however was underwhelming. It was reminiscent of a puzzle that just didn't easily fit. Lacked seasoning and flavor. Grilled yet had a bitter charred taste. The fingerling potatoes were the high point yet failed to cohesively bring the meal together for a savory taste.  Overall, Meh...."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a couple beers and a snack while in town for the weekend--what a great bar.  Impressive craft beer selection including delicious local stuff (NoDa) as well as a wide range from across the country (Founders, Anderson Valley, Left Hand, Ommegang).  We also ordered the calamari \"fries,\" which were unlike any calamari I've had before.  Fresh, fried, and salty with some okra on the side=top notch bar food.  Service was friendly and quick, and the prices were right.  Not the best spot to come watch a game because the tvs are at an odd angle for viewing high up on one of the walls, but on the other hand they were there for a score check-in without being obtrusive/distracting.  Would gladly come back again and try some more of the food, seemed very promising."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends from dinner and went over to Flatiron.   Cool place in Davidson to eat and hang out.     Our group ordered the Braised Short Ribs, Trout and Pork Chop.  Everyone tried all of the dishes.     Pork Chop and it was really good.   Cooked just right (still juicy).  Served with collards and cheddar grits.  Everything complemented each other and would highly recommend.    Braised Beef Short Ribs- A nice piece of boneless beef that was cooked very well.  It is served with Red Mashed Potatoes and red wine sauce.  Again would highly recommend.    Mountain Trout - again like the other dishes this was prepared very well.  This came with a purple sweet potato purée.   All in all the meals were very good and would highly recommend Flat Iron."}
{"text":"Ate a beautiful lunch here in the summertime. I had the chicken dish on the menu and my boyfriend at a Wagu burger that was very good. The menu is simple, and so is the food, but it's flavorful. Portions were a little small considering the price, but they say that they source locally, so I'm willing to pay for higher quality. Truffle fries were delicious. I would consider coming back here for dinner or a glass of wine. The bar area is very large making it seem like a good place to bring a large group."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Flatiron. The food was great. We had the Cuban sandwich and Fish n Chips with truffle oil. Yummy.... Highly suggest you, stop in for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been blessed to have traveled all over the world.  We've experienced many restaurants and many varieties of food.  This restaurant, was by far, one of our faves.  The food was prepared beautifully and tasted just as good.  We came to celebrate our 2nd Anniversary,  but we will be coming back time and time again. Do not miss this restaurant! Our server, Mark,  was amazing. Please ask for him."}
{"text":"I've only been for lunch but both the venue and the food are excellent!! I had a ham sandwich today and it was unique and excellent!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch there on Oct. 7th. Normally the service and the food is outstanding which lead me to lots of referrals to my friends and neighbors who actually went to patronize your restaurant. That day, the service was extremely slow and my wife's \"appetizer\" hanger steak came in cold. We didn't request a new one because it was going to take forever anyways. The portion size also cannot be called lunch, sorry. I think you should review the portion size of that dish. As an example (compared to other fine dining place), BLT Steak in uptown charges $24 for theirs and it is a 10oz. Yours is probably 4oz (if even that) and it is $13... I would strongly suggest doing at least a 6oz for that price."}
{"text":"I was not expecting such a tasty dining experience so far from a big city, but Flatiron exceeded my expectations.  We went with a group of 10, and the wait staff was great, friendly and quick. We ordered the tuna martini to start (divine) and the stuffed pork chop and diver scallops as mains. I would order either again in a heartbeat, though I was more partial to the pork chop (mainly because of all the delicious things it was stuffed with!). Save room for the dessert, though, as they serve a delicious red velvet bread pudding.  The drink selection--both beer and liquor--though cocktail prices were more on par with big cities ($10 and up)."}
{"text":"1st, I would say 4 1/2 stars cuts it...not an actual 5...but...overall this is a nice place for dress down or dress up eating, a few fish dishes, chicken, meats...good starters, good drinks..hands down the best Burgers, I mean it is going to be a $11 burger, but it is big & delish. If you have not tried Flatiron, I invite you, just a solid good place... it's not stuffy, but it's dressier than finding \"Norm\" at the end of the bar everyday...While other new \"pop up's\" are still finding their way in in Davidson...this has a good menu for very diverse tastes..indoor & outdoor seating, good place to people watch...extensive beer list, for those whom it matters to."}
{"text":"Was on a business trip for a work convention and I was tasked with finding a place to have dinner and decided on Flatiron Taphouse and what a mistake it was! The service is terrible and even the owner was a pompous ass to our group and to top it off the food was horrible! Not just bad trust me it was horrible! I personally ordered the chicken and it was so unevenly cooked that half was basically slimy raw and other half was dry as a bone! I am warning you all to stay away from this place at all cost! I can't believe this place is still in business! Bad food! Bad service, Bad experience!!"}
{"text":"It's Sunday.  I'm counting 3 tables in our section that the waitress has to service with a total of 8 people.  4 adults and 4 children are at our table.  We have been waiting for 40 minutes to get our food, of which nothing was \"special order\".   Chicken sandwich, sliders for kids, and 2 salads.    I really want this Resturant to succeed.  I've been to eat at Flat Iron roughly 6 times.  Probably 3 out of 6 have been sub par.  I've held off on this review giving it one more chance.    For $56 (not including tip) for a Sunday lunch with 3 tables active, I would expect exceptional service and quick food delivery.    As a side note, after 30 minutes I got up from the table to see the manager (who I found was one of the owners).  He was mildly apologetic and offered no \"sorry about that here is a free beer or something) which is even more of a disappointment.   I probably would not have accepted anything for free but would expect that as a gesture of gratitude towards an upset customer."}
{"text":"They need to improve on their vegetarian options.Overall,Nice atmosphere,neighborhood and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I started with a glass of Malbec and their fried green Napoleon:  salty fried green tomatoes, sautéed spinach, sweet bits of corn, and bacon atop a dollop of warm, creamy goat cheese (a hearty serving for a mere $8).  The green curry coconut mussels were great and well-priced.    For our first entrée, we split the seared diver scallops:  four good-sized scallops served with risotto-style sweet potatoes, warm heirloom tomato, and orange beurre blanc over arugula ($29).  The risotto-style sweet potatoes were unlike anything I'd ever had before-I actually had to double check the menu to be certain the sweet, creamy cubes weren't some sort of foreign-shaped grain.  Delicious.  Given the restaurant's name, I felt obliged to order some beef. The Wagyu flat iron was the most tender, buttery steak I've had in Charlotte.    Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We went today for an early dinner from Charlotte. Food as well as cocktails were very well prepared and tasty. Portions are small and the octopus is definitely not an appetizer to share. Prices are in the  high range and when bread is not part of a full dinner and has to be requested ... you'd think about it twice to come back. There was not sense of urgency ... however the bartender/server was friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I have tried to like Flat Iron ever since it opened, after all, it is a short walk from our house. But, today we were again disappointed! We thought we'd give brunch a try after church, we arrived to an almost empty restaurant, so we thought this would be a nice breakfast, in a a short time...well, we order iced tea and coffee....there was no fresh coffee, so we waited, no big deal. Then we ordered 2 basic items off the menu, and omelet and Eggs Benedict...30 minutes later (remember, there was only 1 other party in this place) our meal was \"warm\" and my omelet was so bland and un appealing I had a hard time eating it, home -frie potatoes were hard, and sitting in a pool of grease. My husbands dish was not really warm, and pretty average overall. Come on guys...how come you can't figure out how to serve good consistent food....we've given you at least 3 strikes...now you are OUT"}
{"text":"We've frequented Flatiron off and on ever since it first opened. There were a few years between first and current chef when it was \"OK\", but with current chef Bill Schutz, it is at its best ever and has become our favorite restaurant in the area. The menu is rather brief and hasn't changed much over the last few years, but it seems that the quality and flavors keep getting ever better. Case in point is the wonderful grilled octopus appetizer, first appeared as some thin slices, now is a perfectly prepared whole tentacle. Another favorite is the scallops entree which has recently changed accessories for even better balance. And the other day they had escargot as an appetizer special that would have done any French restaurant proud, and there were 16 (sixteen!) snails! The entree specials can be a bit pricey, but so far every one has been worth it. Now if they would only bring back the duck... and maybe add a lamb dish...."}
{"text":"Excellent service and lots of menu choices. I like the ambiance here. The bar is the best seat in the house because you can watch all the action. The food is pretty good and there are different farm fresh items that you don't see on other menus in this area."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for the first time and loved it!  The mussels were out of control...the sauce, oh my goodness...we ordered extra bread to dip in the sauce. Everything our table ordered was awesome...burgers, brussel sprouts app, scallops, shrimp and grits...all fantastic!  Amanda, our server was attentive and helpful the whole meal."}
{"text":"I have eaten at flatiron probably a dozen times in the last 2 years.  I am always pleased with the food and service.  My wife loves the lunch menu veggie wrap.  I normally get a steak.  I like their fries, too."}
{"text":"I had two nice meals at Flatiron last weekend.  The first was the steak Caesar salad.  The salad could have been a little more flavorful but the stake was very good.  The second meal was the fish and chips which was very tasty although the fries were on the soggy side.  The service was always pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"Went out to dinner Sunday night with my husband, we decided to try FlatIron since we hadn't been there before.    Pros: Good service Good beer selection  Cons: Restaurant was \"all out\" of the appetizer I ordered Restaurant was  \"all out\" of the entree I ordered Second choice entree was very bland, not a ton of flavor at all.  I got the brisket.  My husband did enjoy his steak and potatoes though.  Overall, I thought it was a mediocre dinner.  Unfortunately, I probably won't go back.  I was really hoping this place would be good, too! Oh well!"}
{"text":"Visited here while in-town to have lunch with some former colleagues and Flatiron was suggested.  This restaurant and building were still being built when I was last in the area, so I was interested in trying something new.  The atmosphere was pretty chill for a weekday lunch crowd.  Definitely an air of formality (people were there in suits, other townsfolk out for lunch during work), and the darker rich wood decor lends itself to this.  I had their Lunch special which for the day was the Steak Melt, and honestly, given the expectation from the reviews here I felt it was sub-par.  It was decent, but the cut of steak that was selected was a fairly fatty and gristley cut, and there were several pieces which I had to discreetly spit out because I couldn't chew them.  In addition, the onions were quite moist, almost too much for a sandwich, such that half way through I ended up attacking the sandwich with a knife and fork.  That wouldn't have been that bad for a sit-down dinner, but for lunch where a sandwich is to be eaten with the hands, it was a bit off putting.  All that said, however, I wouldn't dismiss this place on this single account; I have a desire to stop back by sometime for a happy hour/dinner to sample their Beer menu and some of their more up-scale offerings to see if they can really deliver the quality of fish, poultry, and meat the website indicates is important to them."}
{"text":"Wow I was VERY impressed with FlatIron last night.  Atmosphere- Relaxed, comfortable - and intuitive. I say intuitive because as soon as it started getting a little too dim in there for our table (I was with my clients) - I didn't even have to say anything and suddenly the lights turned up slightly...we were thankful. The place has a great open kitchen, lovely bar area, and spacious booths/tables. The Davidson area is also quite charming in itself - making Flatiron a really cozy stop.   Food- We started with several appetizers the crab cakes, mussels, and goat cheese dip which were all delicious. The seafood was extremely fresh and tasty. My main dish of scallops were some of the best and biggest I've eaten in a long time - they were WELL worth the $28 price tag. I ate every single bite of everything I was served and that's saying quite a bit because I wasn't all that hungry when I arrived.  The entire table reported loving their dishes.   Beverage- A very nice selection of beer and wine- I had a local Catawba Valley White Zombie that I really enjoy.  Service- Spot On. We had a larger group and there was never much of a lag for anything. She was quick, courteous, and professional .  Overall I was really happy with Flatiron and I'm excited to return."}
{"text":"I expected way better for the venue. Nice place , great location. Everything I ordered was 'just okay' and same for my wife. Theres just so many other really good places in the area , doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good tip on the small plates, very nice apps.  Best calamari ever!  Nice location and very good service.  Next time will sit at bar, as it is set up in a nice square in middle of restaurant.  Excellent choices for the wide variety of beers."}
{"text":"We've been a few times and it has been a little inconsistent. The food is generally good but they sometimes have some real hiccups in the kitchen and it takes way too long to get the food out."}
{"text":"If I were to attempt a pick up line with FlatIron, I would certainly use, \"Hey good lookin', whatcha got cookin'?\" It's a great looking restaurant - dark wood and brick throughout, high ceilings and an overall cozy atmosphere. While parking is most certainly an issue out front, I hear there's a lot around back. Good to know for next time!   The menu lends itself to comfortable, upscale American dishes. I dropped by for lunch, so I perused the myriad of tasty looking sandwich choices, soups, apps and salads. I finally went with the shrimp salad ($10.75): shrimp, asparagus, almonds, tomatoes, goat cheese, pickled radishes with white balsamic vinaigrette.   The salad itself was giant - the greens were seemingly never ending! All the ingredients were uber fresh and I have no complaints, except one...well, technically three. Three was the number of shrimp I received. While the shrimp were nicely cooked and seasoned, I was hoping my shrimp salad had a few more! Regardless, the flavors of the salad were light and tasty, exactly what I was seeking for lunch.   FlatIron offers pretty sweet drink specials during the week, too (copied from their website). Both their beer and wine lists are pretty extensive, so these specials are even more attractive.   MONDAY: All 24 Draft Beers $3.00  TUESDAY: $5 Martinis / $4 House Liquors  WEDNESDAY: Select Wine $5 Glasses / $20 Bottles  THURSDAY: All 24 Draft Beers $3.00"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed dinner with some good friends a few nights ago at Flatiron. We were seated slightly after our reservation time, but that is understandable on a Friday night.   We decided to sample a few appetizers, and were impressed by the portion sizes. Most of the time appetizers disappear quickly because they typically don't take up much real estate on the plate. We tried the Hummus, the Calamari fries, and the soft pretzels. Everything tasted great, and there was so much food, we probably could have stopped there...  Our own main course was good too, I sampled my wife's Filet, and it was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. I had the pork chop and it was flavorful. One of our friends tried their signature dish, the Flatiron steak, and it arrived with the wrong side, so they took it back and a couple minutes later it arrived at the table again. It looked wonderful, but it had been reheated, and the steak had become tough. The manager sensed the problem and came by our table, and kindly offered to have another one made right away. All of us were full from those wonderful appetizers, so they boxed the replacement steak to go, and brought our table complimentary desserts as well.   I would have to say the service was exceptional, as well as the manager's attention to our one issue was outstanding. As human beings, mistakes do happen, but I felt they cared deeply about resolving the problem we had, and this set Flatiron apart from other restaurants that might have ignored the problem and done nothing to resolve it. We will certainly plan to dine at Flatiron again."}
{"text":"I came here with my family and we had a great meal! It's one of the few places open on a Monday so we came on a whim and we were almost deterred by the negative reviews - good thing we ignored them. The food was delicious and the servers were attentive. I recommend the salmon, it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Flatiron Needs to figure out its menu. Not really the best for the price. It trys for local fare but not really executes on the taste. One of the best places though for Davidson."}
{"text":"Usually I would say a three or four stars but not last night 10/27. Had some colleagues in and was happy to take them here. A couple of us got ny strip steaks ordered as medium and came out very rare. Overall quality seemed poor compared to other meals there."}
{"text":"My favorite black bean burger in town.  The patty itself isn't the most flavorful, but the texture is great and the red pepper feta spread that goes on top of it is phenomenal.  It goes together so well.  Fries are fries but I enjoy them as well.  They used to do a free wine tasting one night a month.  It was the greatest thing... #1 Free wine.  #2 They provided you with such an incredible education on the wines they were sampling that evening.  Each month the wines sampled came from a different region and they did a great job teaching you about it regions and the wines.  I believe they still do a variation of it, just have to purchase dinner.  Would still be an incredible experience.  I always tried not to buy dinner but ended wanting something anyways."}
{"text":"Flatiron has a lively ambiance and super friendly staff.  The menu consists of local and many organic options but the prices are quite reasonable.  The appetizer salads were tasty, but be sure to go for the more unique choices such as the grilled shrimp as the green salad for $6 was a small plate of greens, a couple of walnuts in a vinaigrette.    The beef is the star of the show.  The steaks are paired with delicious and flavorful sides. While two steaks that were both ordered medium rare came out quite different they were both flavorful and tender, even if one was a bit bloody.    For desert the layered cupcake is a hit.  Moist and sweet it was a nice finish to a great meal.  Flatiron is a great addition to the somewhat sleepy town of Davidson."}
{"text":"Salmon was cooked to perfection. Good atmosphere and great staff! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal when dining here for the first time during Restaurant Week! When you enter the place, you see an enormous, beautifully curved bar and lots of patrons dining there. We love eating at bars and will likely try to sit there on our next visit.  We were seated approximately 15 minutes after our reservations - not too bad considering there are not that many tables in the dining room and it's probably hard to time it exactly right. We loved sitting in a large booth in the back of the restaurant facing the street, so the wait was definitely worth it!  I had the calamari and my hubby had a salad for our appetizers. The calamari was  a large portion of delicious strips topped with a slightly sweet Asian chili dressing. Very good, and easily sharable.   For our entrees, I had the snapper special served on a bed of buckwheat noodles. It was AMAZING and should become part of their regular menu. My hubby had the New York Strip and said it was perfect.   Our dessert was the only disappointment of the meal. I had the chocolate brownie cheesecake and it was a tad dry. My hubby had an apple tart that was just ok.  Throughout the meal, our server was pleasantly attentive. The owner (or manager?) also stopped by to see how we were doing. I thought the service overall was absolutely top notch.  Just a note about parking. There is a very small lot connected to the building, as well as valet parking. However, if you are like me and don't like giving up your keys, you will need to find street parking. We were able to find a spot in front of the CVS, so the walk was not that far.   Despite the fact that the dessert kind of fell flat for us, we will most definitely return. Their food and service are similar to 131 Main, so if you like 131, I highly recommend you give FlatIron a try the next time instead!"}
{"text":"Flatiron was crowded but we managed to get late reservations.   Our meals were delicious and delivered in a timely manner.   Staff seemed a bit harried (because of the crowd probably).  We'll return, but maybe not on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Came for lunch.  Food took too long and there was barely any chicken on my buffalo chicken salad. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Good food. I love this place... it could be a little faster in the service area. I love that they're open on Sundays! One of our go to places,"}
{"text":"Overall, a mixed experience. Entrees were better than appetizers. Drinks were pretty good.  Drinks: I had the Romeo & Juliet. Delicious vodka drink with muddled orange and cucumber. Quite tasty, not too sweet.   Appetizers: Worst part of the experience. Painfully mediocre. They got me worried about the quality of the main course. I got the tuna poke martini. It was amateurish, really. It was a martini glass with a small clump of wasabi stuck where the base meets the stem. The glass contained way too much seaweed topped with unattractive cubes of tuna topped with way too many crunchy noodles. I had to take off the crunchy noodles with my hand to get to the tuna. Then, I kind of had to scoop tiny portions of wasabi with the fork and skewer a piece of tuna. There should be a sauce with wasabi in it drizzled over the tuna. It just didn't work. My favorite restaurant at home serves this immaculate tasting and immaculately presented tuna and watermelon poke with a delicious sauce, and this paled in comparison. I also tasted a friend's spinach salad, which was bland.   Entree: I had to go for the meatloaf wrapped in bacon and puffed pastry. Overall, it was pretty tasty. The bacon kind of got lost--not sure there was enough of it wrapping the meatloaf. The pastry, meatloaf, and sauce were delicious (though the pastry could have been a tiny bit lighter). Overall, a unique dish I would certainly order again, but there are things that could be improved (more bacon, lighter and flakier pastry).   Ambiance: Overall, this is a really modern, well designed restaurant (especially the bar). This could have a really thriving scene. What KILLED it was the awful smooth jazz playing in the background. Any sense of \"cool\" this place had was destroyed by the music. I felt like I was in an elevator.  Service: Excellent. Attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"We have been coming here forever.  We have never been disappointed and have had date nights, family gatherings, lunch meetings, pretty much everything and the food is always excellent and the service is fantastic.  The beer and wine selection is way above average and the specials are always amazing.  We have never been disappointed and will come back time and time again.  We love it here!"}
{"text":"Wonderful salmon with baby bok Chou on a bed of risotto. The foam on top was perfect. Thank you Chef Bill!"}
{"text":"Ribeye, truffle fries and octopus, oh my! The steak was cooked perfectly and beautifully prepared, mashed potatoes perfectly seasoned and octopus you could eat all day. This was easily the best meal I've had in quite a while"}
{"text":"We reserved a table for 20 people on a Sunday night at 8 pm and they did a fantastic job. They called to confirm beforehand. The food was excellent as usual and the waitress was amazing. She brought us all water before we even showed up, got our orders right and was watching for refills and generally made the whole evening a breeze. It's the kind of place where out of town folks can get southern cooking and others can have healthy options or new American fare. I highly recommend this place for large groups."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to try their burgers (recommended by a friend). Although the meat of the burger was great that's about it. It was not cooked correctly. I expected more than iceburg lettuce, questionable tomato and fast food fires with it. You really should warn people about those fries. You know the kind with the coating on them. Fresh cut fries would have been what I expected with a $16 hamburger. The missing ceiling tiles in the dining room and bathrooms added a nice touch also. You should probably replace the burnt out lightbulbs in the ladies room ( hard to see the facilities ). Our waitress was nice enough......"}
{"text":"Very few restaurants were open in New Year's Day but FlatIron was one of them! I'm astonished by the average rating of this place because we enjoyed our dining experience! Aside from being lucky and finding this place despite most places on Main Street being closed, we enjoyed great waiting service and excellent food.   FlatIron for lunch feels a bit like a casual, trendy spot. Wide variety of beer, wine, and spirits.   Fish & Chips ($14) - Surprised to see this lunch option as a starter but *shrug*! To each their own, I guess. Even if it was listed as a starter, I wasn't planning to share! The haddock was cooked well: thinly crispy on the outside, yet fresh  and moist on the inside. The haddock wasn't oily either. The sauce on the side was different in a good way - not the traditional tartar sauce that comes with fish and chips. Perfect French fries."}
{"text":"We were excited to see another restaurant open up in Davidson and couldn't wait to try Flat Iron (having our first child delayed this a little bit, but we finally made it out last Friday)  Very nice ambiance, we were seated right away, but our booth did not have much space (i have a belly, but i'm not that big where the table should be about 5 inches in front me, my wife is pretty skinny especially for someone who gave birth 6 weeks ago and she felt a little cramped as well). Our server was very attentive and very friendly.  We didn't order any appetizers, and the food still took a little while to get to us, but overall it was pretty decent. I had the Hanging Tender, the meat was a little tough but the corn and mashed potatoes were excellent. My wife had the ribs and she really liked them and she actually finished her entire rack, which speaks to the portions being about right.  This left room for dessert which was great: we ordered the homemade expresso and vanilla ice cream and we loved it.  My rating is actually probably 3.5 stars due to the wait time for the food, the rather uncomfortable booth, and my steak being a little chewy, but we had an overall enjoyable experience there."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Food is okay but service was lacking."}
{"text":"Really nice place. Very well designed and appointed. Unfortunately the food was just okay. My wife go the lunch special of the day, a turkey pesto sandwich, and I got the Cubano. The turkey was drastically dry, though the side of garlic mayo helped. The Cubano was pretty good. I was a little let down that it was not pressed (kind of like a panini) which is the norm. As a rule, I feel that a 4 star and up review means that it's a destination restaurant. So, would I eat here again? Yes. But would I make a trip to eat here? No. A bit of a let down. Not great, not awful, just okay."}
{"text":"Ok food, ok service, nice atmosphere.  Salads are ok, but the bean burger was so awful, I couldn't eat it.  Over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"This place has it all: great setting, delicious food and good selection of craft beer! I do suggest making a reservation though-we had to eat at the bar due to a big weekend crowd and the only thing keeping this review from 5 stars is the overcrowded bar section due to all the other non-reservation making people!  We sampled different beers and all were very good! We started with the spinach and crab dip which was some of the best I've had. We also sampled the shrimp&grits and the Japanese beef flatiron: both superb!!  All in all, if you are in the Davidson area--this is a must eat :)"}
{"text":"As a Davidson restaurant, this is my favorite place to bring friends. The food is always perfect as is the service! It is easy to make reservations too!"}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill.  Cold steak tonight, cooked medium well instead of medium.  Salad missing half of the toppings and to top it off...cold coffee and and one disgusting soggy red velvet cupcake.  This place has been a favorite, but this experience is enough to keep me away for good."}
{"text":"Fresh, Delicious, Local, and Friendly. I really like Flatiron Grill. The menu is always full of fresh and tasty dishes. Plus, for those who like beer, they have quite a few beers on tap (even unique local brews). Of course, they also have a full bar and wine. All of their protein is locally sourced - so it's fresh, raised with care, tender and flavorful! They have a unique meatloaf dish that I particularly enjoy. They changed their french fries (to natural cut) about a year ago, and while the fries are good, they were better. I also like their sweet potato fries, so long as they don't come out greasy. But you go here for the food - the main courses which are always great! Plus, they're on OpenTable which I always use so I never have to wait. Overall, great experience and I like that they participate in the Entertainment book deals."}
{"text":"Flatiron has, once again, become our go-to restaurant. The most recent menu as of this writing is outstanding, especially the kale and quinoa salad (with grilled salmon!). The Brussels sprouts appetizer (also with salmon added) is amazing!  As always, the serving staff are excellent, and I appreciate that the turnover is low, so it's nice to see the same faces. Shout out to owner/manager Jason Tognarina and Chef Bill Schutz."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I can not, unfortunately, comment on FlatIron's normal menu.    I was at FlatIron for a 5 course beer pairing dinner with Ass Clown Brewery.  It was amazing.  Each of the courses were fairly light and creatively prepared.  The only thing better than the meal itself were the perfectly brewed beers.  I'm a pretty big fan of micro-brews and no tasting expert by any means, but I have to say that it was an awesome experience.  The chef and brew-master were there and explained the meal pairing and brewing technique which definitely added to the meal.  There was plenty of time to chat with the chef and brew-master - as well as the other people at the table.    I was told that FlatIron teams up with breweries and wineries a couple of times a month for evens such as this.  If you get the chance I highly recommend giving it a try.  The service was excellent and there was a good crowd of people that made the experience all the more enjoyable.   The meal was a little pricey at $50 a plate, but overall I think anyone who attends one of these events would consider it worth it."}
{"text":"Food was good, not spectacular.   Had the NY strip which was cooked just as requested.   Bartender was great.  The best part of the meal was the caramel bread pudding for dessert.   Un-freaking-believable.  I'm not a big bread pudding fan but figured I would get something different.   Man am I glad I did.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I really hate to not be able to give this joint a higher rating. We were there on Mother's Day at 11am (when they literally just open for the day - only 1 other table was seated). I found this place on OpenTable last minute - and due to Mother's Day, lunch/brunch places were slim picking. Per OpenTable, they were to offer lunch menu from 11-3 that day with a few brunch items, and dinner menu for the remaining day. So you can see why I was surprised when we were offered ONLY dinner menu, at 11am, with no brunch items mentioned. I asked our server and she wasn't able to give me any answers or solutions. Dinner menu it was (and I really wanted to try their Curry Chicken Salad, sigh)  Luckily their dinner menu offers small plates, or else I would be breaking some serious bank just for a lunch (FYI - their dinner entrees are all $20+ with some exceeding $30+)  My parents and I shared an order of mussels ($13), fish & chips ($13), and sliders ($9). Overall impression of the food - bland. I know salt isn't good for us, but I do believe in using them in food. The best thing was the fries (the fish on the other hand was not crispy enough, lack seasoning, and broke easily - and they were more like fish fingers not a big slice of fish, good for sharing however). 2nd best thing was the sliders (2 to an order); they are pretty big for sliders. The bacon and cheese and grilled onions helped with the flavor but the burger patties weren't seasoned. The least flavorful item was the mussels, but then I don't want to blame them since I ordered it without goat cheese (mom doesn't do cheese, let alone a \"stinky\" one). The mussels were fresh tasting, however, the broth was milky looking but didn't taste like anything. The big chunks of bacon in the broth were good enough to fish for.   We did have an incident with our food - we found an odd metal string in our fries, and the management was very prompt to respond and they did not charge us for the fish & chips. We weren't too bothered - it was just metal but I can see how this could be a big deal for someone else.  Overall I was a little disappointed in the food quality. I didn't like the feeling of \"bait & switch\" when it came to the menu offering. The place is cute, and locates in the smack middle of Downtown Davidson. I was told they have a good selection of beers on tap. Maybe it was an off day - and due to the good service from the management, I am willing to give this place another try - just not on a holiday Sunday."}
{"text":"Have been here twice, once for lunch and another time for dinner. Lunch was good, service was great and our mojitos were excellent. Dinner was fantastic! I ordered the duck special, which was cooked perfectly and the sides complemented the dish wonderfully. My husband ordered the steak and was very pleased with his selection, again another prefect execution with the dish. After dinner we had Irish coffees which are also excellent. For dinner I would consider this a higher scale restaurant with smaller portions but high-end choices. We will definitely be back for another date night."}
{"text":"In town for a customer lunch for work and Flatiron was one of the only places opened that day. I had the fish tacos which were decent. Prices were fair, but presentation could have been improved. We arrived at 11:30am and by the time we left at 1pm, the place was full. The ambiance and decor are perfect for business conversations, but I found the menu to be limited."}
{"text":"When my parents came to town they wanted to take us to a restaurant we hadn't been to yet. FlatIron immediately came to mind, not only because I've passed it several times while in Davidson, but also because I had a nice little Groupon to use. We made reservations through Yelp for a Saturday night dinner and were able to get a table reserved for 6:45.  We arrived right on time and were immediately seated. My mother wasn't happy with our current table and the hostess happily moved us to a spot that was more acceptable. The interior is pleasant, with a modern, trendy feel. At first glance it seems to me more of a taphouse/[pub, but the menu is definitely more worthy of a steakhouse. The beer and wine menu is also very impressive, with quite a few microbrews to choose from. Our server was very knowledgeable and attentive, coming to check on us often through the course of the meal, but not in an annoying way.  For an appetizer we all shared an order of the calamari ($9), and it was some of the best I've ever had. Rather than the usual rings and tentacles, these were thick, meaty strips that were fried in a very light batter. The calamari was very tender and the sauce it was served with melded wonderfully with the calamari.   For dinner I ordered the ribeye steak ($26). The steak was just the right size and cooked to order (medium rare), but I found it slightly tougher than I've had at other restaurants. It's covered in their house-made steak sauce which was an initial turn-off since I prefer my steak naked. But I have to say that this steak sauce was pretty spot on and definitely made up for the quality of the steak itself. The steak fries are more like potato wedges, so they are very cakey and potatoey, and they were decent. I'm shocked to say this, but I actually liked the smoked asparagus more than the potatoes. The smokiness of the asparagus was amazing and really made those greens better than I've ever had them. If I have the option, it's smoked all the way for my asparagus future.  My wife ordered the sea scallops ($27) which were excellent. They were clean and tender and had a wonderful taste. It was served with a sweet potato rissoto which was the star of the dish in my mind. It had such a great taste, it is up there with some of the most amazing sides I've ever had. I don't know what FlatIron's policy is towards switching out sides but I know I would love to get that with any entree I wanted.  My mother was feeling a sweet tooth attack and ordered two desserts for us to share. There is a bread pudding option that changes daily, and it happened to be French Vanilla ($7)  when we were there. This was some pretty banging bread pudding. It is a huge portion that was plenty for the four of us to dig our forks into. There was a crisp crust of something on top of the bread that made you savor every bite, and the entire thing was topped with a heaping scoop of homemade vanilla bean ice cream. The plate was drenched in a raspberry compote, and all these flavors came together for one heck of a dessert. The other dessert we ordered were the truffles from the Davidson Chocolate Company ($8.) It came with three little truffles along with some strawberries and candied walnuts. There were two really bitter, really dark chocolate truffles and one milk chocolate covered in sea salt. The strawberries were very fresh and sweet, and the candied walnuts were good. Still, I felt that the dessert was not worth the $8. I enjoyed the bread pudding a lot more and felt that the quality and quantity you got outweighed that of the truffles.  FlatIron is a decent place to get a good meal or grab a beer or two with friends. I was a bit disappointed in the quality of their ribeye steak, but I would be willing to go back again to give it another whirl at some point in the future. While I found the steak to be lacking, I will say that the desserts are definitely legit and worth checking out."}
{"text":"came here with a friend and both ordered burgers. the burger and fries were both terribly salty, we found. granules of salt were visible on the fries, which were otherwise very good fries. next time I'd say no salt, but the burger was also soooo salty i don't think there will be a next time. maybe the super salt taste came from the bacon jam? a shame because the meat was tender"}
{"text":"This place was a very nice place to enjoy dinner and a few beers before while waiting for the Charlotte traffic to die down. We had the pretzels as an app, they are delicious and I highly recommend them in the beer cheese.  This place looked appalling to us as vegetarians with all the farms they support. The menu has a few vegetarian options but most of the menu is meat. We order the hand cut fries for the kids, they came out a bit cool but were very good. We got the goat cheese salad and added the devil eggs as extra protein. We finished off the meal with the creme brulee. meal came out to be just over $100 bucks so not a cheap place to eat for the amount of food we got but it was very good and i would go back again."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and loved it. We didn't have a reservation, but were sat very quickly. Our server was amazing. I wanted to order a drink on the menu, but was torn between 2 drinks and could not decide. The waitress came back to the table with a drink that was a mix between the two and I loved it. The waitress and bartender both exceeded my expectations! The food was delicious and the atmosphere was delightful, I plan to return here."}
{"text":"Newly opened so I suppose they are due some grace but...  With an Exec  Chef and part-owner with deep roots into the Sonoma restaurants group, I have to say that our meal was officially underwhelming.  Especially when you also consider the 45+ minute wait and the prices.    Pluses... The beer selection and attentiveness of the staff at the bar.  Even the guy who had just started that day was on top of things enough to go check on the status of our reservation when he recognized how long we had been sitting at the bar.  Also, our waiter was appropriately balanced in his attentiveness and absences which was appreciated.  Minuses....  Where to start....  When they came to us the first time for a seat, the hostess pointed us to the two-top about 4 feet behind our seats at the bar.  If we had wanted to eat \"in\" the bar, that was already an option since we had been sitting there for 45 minutes.  We politely declined the table and were told it would be another 30 minutes.  While a little absurd, it was fine because we were enjoying ourselves and the bar staff.  The wait turned out to be less than 10 for a four-top  in the main dining room.    We ordered two items from their small plates menu, Smoked trout on a spinach salad with cashews and a vinaigrette and the Grilled Calamari with pepperocinis and another vinaigrette-ish dressing.  Both were SO bland.  The trout had no smoke flavor whatsoever, the vinaigrette was under-seasoned and in very short supply.  At least the spinach was fresh.  The Calamari were all but tasteless unless you loaded the tubes up with the hot pepper mix.  Again the dressing it was on top of was similarly flat and they made the worst sin you can make with calamari.  Over-cooking.  Needless to say, it was on the chewy side.  For an entree, we split their signature Waygu Flatiron with a fingerling/asparagus/mayonnaise type salad on top and some wilited spinach on the bottom.  The steak was plentiful, correctly cooked and sliced thinly but again, lacked flavor as did the \"ale-jus\" which might as well have been brown colored water on the bottom of the plate for all the taste it had.  We will not be returning until we hear from trusted friends that both the front and the back of the house are under-control and delivering the quality we would expect.  Compare this to a place like 131 Main who we also visited their first week open in Huntersville and Flat Iron comes up woefully short in all regards."}
{"text":"Loved the pork chop and burger.  Flank steak was great with Rioja but maybe could have used more chimichurri. Not sure. It was very good though. Brussel sprouts were exceptional. Deviled eggs were awesome. Service was perfect in every way. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Much better than I'd expected. I'd seen some less than perfect reviews so I hadn't made an effort to try it out. I'm glad I finally did.   Great food, nice wine list and the service was spot-on.  Who knew you could make mac & cheese without pasta...?  We'll be adding this to our list of favorites spots around town. It's even better than 131 Main!"}
{"text":"After disappointments in the past, I'm thrilled to say that FlatIron is one of my local favorites.  The food is really good and service has been very good as well.  We have been there 4-5 times over the past 6 months and really enjoyed our food and the entire experience.  Just made a reservation for my mother's 86th birthday to celebrate.  Looking forward to it!"}
