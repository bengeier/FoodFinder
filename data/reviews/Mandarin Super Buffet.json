{"text":"Went to Mandarin buffet on Sunday I loved it the crab legs with a snow crab excellent cooked perfectly every one I ate they were large snow crab the shrimp there is unbelievable the whole place was excellent the waitresses were excellent even the guy bringing the food that was very helpful plenty of everything I go there again the sunday was the best sunday for eating I've had in awhile great desserts great main courses so much food"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my picky daughter. Mistake! She ate 1 french fry. One. Wouldn't eat anything else. I did like the bbq pork, pudding, orange slices, and canned peaches. Nothing else though. Large variety, but nothing was good. All had a weird taste to it. Just yuck. Will not go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here because my phone said that the Home Town Buffet was located at this address but found out it was taken over by the Maderine Buffet instead, we decided to try it anyway. For the price it was, it was not worth a dime. The food was ill prepared, the staff was pretty much non-existing and rude for example, when asking for a refill the server replied \"don't you want to wait until you get home for a drink?\" When it came to dessert that seemed to be the only thing that seemed edible besides the fact that the jell-o felt like it was made from rubber and we stayed away from the ice cream because for some reason they kept oysters next to it and there was an oyster shell in one of the buckets of ice cream. The atmosphere was just uncontrolled screaming children and when I got home I felt like I needed a bottle of petobismal. I would highly not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I just revisited this place on Satuday. I recommend that you take a tiny sample of everything interesting to try before loading up your plate. For instance, the fried chicken wings have some weird curry spice or something.  On Saturday they had raw oysters on the half shell. I was the only one partaking in these lovely critters, as I remembered to bring lemon wedges, captain's wafers and seafood cocktail sauce. I didnt die.  I recommend highly the hot and sour soup, the sauteed string beans, and those open pork dumpling things near the soup.  I ate five plates full of the things I liked, including dessert cakes covered with ice cream covered with whipped cream.  Saturday's price was about $14, service was decent, the people well-behaved. If anyone finds a buffet with perfect tempura vegetables, I'd be in heaven. Only seen them on the east coast..."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple times, I came in today and saw this giant roach. It looks like it's been living there. Not returning......"}
{"text":"3/12/2015  Yeah, what happened? Food quality went down, cleanliness went down, service went down.....yuck. Too bad, I used to love this place.     I give this place 5 stars for a few reasons...  I always arrive around 11:30 am when the food is just put out and it is always well presented, hot and good quality.  The service is always good as far as getting drinks refilled quickly and friendly staff.  The selection is HUGE, if you can't find something you like you are not really looking.  I love the nibble table, all those little desserts and a wide variety of fruit.  If you are vegetarian there is a good selection to choose from so me AND my friends can all have things we like.  I won't rate the sushi for I do not eat it, never have, can't say.  Overall it's clean, very well priced and has lots of good food to choose from, everything I like in a buffet."}
{"text":"I posted a positive review of this restaurant a little while back, but the quality has really gone down. The interior of the restaurant is not that old, but it has been horribly maintained. Scratches and stains everywhere. You can smell the unsanitary bathrooms from a mile away. To top things off, the not-so-good service has gotten even worse. It can take the employees a whole fifteen minutes before getting you your beverages, and the plates stay on your table for just about the whole meal. Even the food is very often served cold now.  Also, this place does not have very much going for it as far as deserts go. They serve cakes that were obviously pre-packaged or frozen. No soft-serve machine, just regular ice-cream (which I'm not a fan of). And the fruit they serve isn't the best quality.  Chinese buffets are springing up all over Phoenix, and right now, this one doesn't have much to offer."}
{"text":"First time coming here. It was on Sunday and it was PACT! The workers are so clumsy. They were dropping plates, sodas, money! I saw some plates that were dirty! I dont really mind but just wanted to get that out. Talk about the food. It was delicious!  I was very happy. The food was warm, they kept switching the trays to provide fresh food. The icecream comes in a sealed plastic cup. It was soft and yummy. The Oreo cupcakes were soooo good. I honestly felt like stuffing some in my purse"}
{"text":"Ive been here before with ny family and I hadn't been there in awhile so I told my boyfriend and we went to eat. The food was average kind of tastless and bland. Also, the orange chicken wasn't very good. It seemed dirty. The waiters would just stand around not even clean. The only good thing I could say about this place is that they have an incredible variety of ice cream not just simple chocolate and vanilla."}
{"text":"Department of Health has been notified of the filthy conditions of this restaurant and individuals coming into contact with the eColi bacteria."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the worst places I've eaten. The food was luke warm, most of the meat dishes were well over cooked or burnt. Every dish tried was so bland it didn't matter if you were eating chicken and broccoli or the house special which was a spicy chicken, they both tasted the same! The squid was so over cooked you couldn't even chew it, the mussels had a home made spicy sauce that was labeled spicy but was as sweet as the orange chicken. If I was rich and bored I'd pay people NOT to eat here, it is that bad. Below average, even for a buffett.... Please save yourself and do not eat here!"}
{"text":"The customerservice was horrible and the place was filthy. As soon as we got there we were left standing for 5 minutes before somebody  greeted us and gave us a table. After we asked for our drinks it took about 20 minutes for them to arrive which by that timei was already done with one whole plate of food. The plates had residue of older food like they werent washed. The walls had stains and smudges. I will not be returning to this shithole. Goodluck if u wanna go. Shêshê!!!"}
{"text":"Food is typical of a buffet. Popcorn shrimp was good and not over cooked. The vegetables and salads are fresh and with balanced flavor. The Sushi is fresh and has well made rice. The service was great. They always ask if you need a refill. The deserts are mostly plain. The lemon cake had good texture and flavor.  Overall, I would return when seeking variety but not the place for top notch foodies."}
{"text":"Quiet polite staff.  Not dirty but not clean.  Smells of a funky fish tank.  Everything had a mild fishy taste from the rice to the (what I think was) Teriyaki Chicken with brocoli.  This is not a stop for a good buffet.  There is another Buffet like this one in South Phx near 40th and Baseline.  So similar you'd think they are the same company.  Major difference is the One on Baseline is like a Palace in comparison.  This seems like a Team effort problem rather than company model.  But this is just an opinion.  Reasonable price if the food had been better."}
{"text":"I have to say I did not expect much but from the time you enter the restaurant there was no enthusiasm from the hostess nor the wait staff. We were lead to our table and there was so much trash and napkins on the floor I had second thoughts. The food was not special and there were so many steam tables that were either empty or they looked like someone was digging through the food  in search of jewelry They had a lot of food to choose from but I had only found one or two things that I really liked. I love Chinese food but I think this cured my search for a good oriental buffet. I will not be back to this place again. I really wanted to like it but no thank you.."}
{"text":"I ate here once before, wasn't terribly impressed but thought I would give them another chance.  Sadly, this buffet offered the same bizarre experience as my first visit, so I figured I would share.  Basically, the food is all over the map - I don't generally go to a chinese buffet to eat old pasta in watered down ketchup, or visit the taco bar (really?) Of the chinese food, 3 of the dishes were variants of \"meat with wilted broccoli\" and 2 variants of \"odd-tasting chicken in some kind of syrup\".  Seriously, that was the full extent of the chinese-related entrees on the buffet.  Some other lowlights:  a large pile of wrinkly old green beans that looked like they had been cooked in a deep fryer 3 kinds of nasty-looking, picked-apart fish in puddles of grease teriyaki chicken slices swimming in 5/8\" of grease breaded, deep-fried, syrup-drenched rotten (as in \"not safe to eat\") chicken \"pork tamales\" (seriously, wtf?)  More importantly, as a former chef I'm surprised the health department hasn't swooped in - every single dish was served lukewarm at best, there was no steam rising from the steam tables, and the cold trays were also at room temperature.  The nastiest thing was the tray with a lukewarm pile of old, crusty tuna salad on it - all I can say is that it was foul and i hope nobody actually ate it or the oysters next to it...    After seeing all this, I definitely avoided the sushi bar and mongolian grill - no use in tempting fate.  Overall, I was so grossed out that I only ate one plate before leaving (for the record, I'm a biggish guy, usually I will chow down 3-4 plates at a good buffet).  In short, I know that there really are no good chinese buffets in Phoenix any more, but this was absolutely the worst food I have ever experienced anywhere in the city.  Worse yet, their lack of sanitation and temperature control makes dining into a russian roulette game for your GI tract.  Hopefully they get shut down before they kill someone."}
{"text":"Food is good for a Buffet, service was good. Great place to go if you want to get ripped off. Went for lunch (lunch until 3:30pm then diner rate which is $3.00 more) arrived at 3:05 pm left at 3:52pm was charged diner rate, most places you go if you arrived at lunch time that is what you are charged for. Used a 15% off coupon which they took but did not deduct . The most interesting thing is that the receipt was time printed 4:46pm almost an hour after I left. Needless to say I won't go Back there, and will not recommend this place to anyone, If this review help anyone to avoid this place good if it helps in putting this place out of business great!"}
{"text":"Waited 5 minutes to be seated. Not so busy for lunch that it should have taken that long.   I don't expect great food at a Chinese buffet, but this stuff was below my meager tipping point. The sushi was not rolled tight enough - fell apart too easily. The honey chicken was little cubes swimming in a horrible sauce with lots of canned pineapple chunks. Sauce was thin and I couldn't detect any honey in it.   When I first approached the buffet, they just dumped some fresh fried fish in the pan. I jumped on that. Too bad, since the fish inside had no flavor, the crust was a big shell surrounding a small piece of fish, and the whole thing was greasy.   Spare rib chunks had no flavor, and had bits of cartilage that are not familiar to me in pork ribs - maybe it was water buffalo.   And finally, the thing they called peanut butter chicken was just gross. One strip I couldn't even get my fork to cut through it. And greasy!   Waited forever for my check. Was ignored for twenty minutes, even though my plates had be taken and I told her I didn't need any more water. She finally brought the check when I was paying. Should have just walked out.   As a former trucker, I've eaten at hundreds of places like this. This is one of only a few in the whole country that I won't return to. Ack!"}
{"text":"The place has gone through a complete renovation! And the best part is that the prices haven't gone up from when it used to be called ?Great Wall Super Buffet?, the quality of the food has improved as well, hopefully that won't change anytime soon. Will be going back soon! 'nuff said."}
{"text":"Another one of those all-u-can-eat buffets.  This one has lots of choices...But not any really tasty ones. Like most of these places the secret is to find the items they do best and stick with those, however I failed at that, but it was not due to lack of trying. Although a lot of things looked good, they were either just bland, dry, or just not good.   The one exception I found were the Gyoza (potstickers, dumplings or what ever this place chose to call them).  Although they are the same as served at a lot of the others chinese buffets, this one actually did them right...Not dried-out or deep fried. There are plenty of more chinese buffets in the desert, keep looking!"}
{"text":"For a please-the-masses type Chinese buffet, you should expect lots of people, moderate noise level and a bit of a wait...you should also expect quality food, variety, freshness, efficient replacement of food trays and a reasonable price--   This place has all that!   Plus wait isn't that bad even peak hours.   Their Asian/American fare is great, and given the CenPho area a decent selection of Mexican fare as well. Crab Legs here are moist, flavorful easy to crank open! Kid friendly, good parking by Christown mall, theatre and light rail..only cons are its not spic n span clean, but it's a huge accommodating placek that's jam packed on weekends, and its hygienic and clean enough. Dessert area just so-so much like all these buffets -- but overall  the food (all of it) how quickly you sit down, price, location and variety make it solid 4-star and a go-to spot.  Peep a flick, then lunch here then Costco, Target all on one trip!"}
{"text":"This is a better Chinese buffet than others we have tried in the area, but that's not saying much.   The buffet is $12.59 for adults on Sundays. The buffet has most of the popular dishes-orange chicken, teriyaki chicken, sweet and sour pork, etc. There are some cold salads, fruit, desserts, and crab legs. There were also tacos and pizzas. There is a Mongolian BBQ and sushi.  The food was fine for the most part. The sushi tasted bad.   I wouldn't recommend going to the bathroom before you eat- the hallway, which runs alongside the kitchen, smells terrible. That's making me think about whether I'll ever eat here again.   As per usual, the meal ended with a standard stale fortune cookie to send you on your way."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday at 1:00pm when their snow crab legs caused a riot! The service was fantastic, given all the people. Everyone kept their cool. Adult patrons were patient and polite to each other. Every wait staff person answered my questions about where to get everything. I FEASTED on perfectly steamed crab legs to my heart's delight.   Warning to the vegetarians, though:  not much variety offered for vegetables without meats. Some fresh fruits, though."}
{"text":"Lots of items, REAL ICE CREAM -- it's as hard as half-dry cement so bring your muscles. Mounds of crawdads if you want. Some items are OK, many are mediocre - I've had versions of what they have somewhere else, done much better. Mongolian BBQ table is available. You'll find something you'll like.  Crispy chicken wings, decent noodles. Plenty of fresh fruit.  Overall a good bargain because of the large variety, but no wow factor. Come hungry so you can make your dive-in better! I always skip breakfast for a buffet lunch. After a while it becomes all you CARE to eat.  INSIDE SKINNY: crawdads, crabs, shrimp, soups, ice cream, better than normal red goopy sauce for the cheese won-tons."}
{"text":"tried this place many times. never had a good dinner. place is dirty and smells of damp towel. restrooms are gross. dirty and smelly.  food is hit and miss. mostly miss. quit going here. many other better places to eat."}
{"text":"This place has been several  different buffets throughout the years. This is the best one it has ever been. It is very clean and they are always refilling the food and wiping every thing down and cleaning everything. They have a beautiful fish pond inside that is nice and clean with Koi fish and turtles inside as well as a  lovely mini waterfall.  The hot tea is included with your meal. Adult lunch is $6.99 and dinner is $9.99. Soft drinks are $1.49 ,such a deal! Every type of food is here you could imagine. Chinese ,seafood, fired food, tacos , Mongolian BBQ. Plus tons of desserts and even ice cream, plus the food is good. They are very friendly as well. This is a great place to come for lunch."}
{"text":"I love this place, I've been going there for a long time. The best part has to be the Mongolian bbq/steak grill. Also excellent employees"}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here and I have to say this is the best Chinese style buffet I have eaten at."}
{"text":"The little lady and I were on a buffet kick for a hot second, and this was one of our stops.  While they did have a large array of food to choose from, I did feel a little skeeved out.  For starters, almost every plate I grabbed was still dirty, with dried chunks of the previous diners selection still hanging on.  Second, a lot of the items looked as though they had been sitting for a good long while...and lastly, I was bummed that every time I went to get some soup the bowls were totally out. Some of the food had good flavor, and it wasn't all bad...but when I'm paying for food I want the good stuff.  As for the service, the dude was prompt to clear our dirty plates and fill our drinks.  Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Decent food, surprisingly.  EXTREMELY dirty place though.  Filthy really.  This former Hometown Buffet is a prime example of why you should NEVER carpet restaurants...rice everywhere!  Also, am I the only one amused and confused when Chinese buffets serve Mac and cheese and similar items?"}
{"text":"Its your typical Chinese buffet, nothing to rave about.  Not a big fan, the food was ok.  But our table was sticky and dirty.  That would be one reason that I will not go back, the place is dirty not clean, floor is dirty."}
{"text":"This is like the end times buffet. What i mean by that is. At one time not that long ago Phoenix \"had\" a lot more buffets then it currently does. Their was Old Country Buffet, Home Town Buffet, Golden Coin, another Chinese buffet on 51st ave and Indian School rd (no longer there). Yumm buffet on 15th ave and Thomas and another on 19th ave and Peoria. Autum Court (when it was located on Central ave) had a lunch only buffet. Oh and how could i forget one of my favourites \"Furrs\" love me some Furrs buffet. Northern and I-17( then it closed) and it was Osborn and 7th ave(then that closed) the final one was on Grand and 113th ave( not sure the satus) . So my point is this their are a lot less buffets in Phx now then before.  Madarin Super Buffet used to be a Home Town Buffet. We were all sad to see Home Town close. But this buffet Mandarin Super buffet is really quite good. And not expensive.  They have so many buffet items to choose from. Your sure to find some thing you like. And all very fresh. At the back of the buffet they have the Mongolian grill. Fill up your plate with as much meat, shrimp, noodles(3 types) and. A good assortment of veggies as you like, add the sauces you like and they have several. And garlic and ginger. Chilli peppers in oil. Hand your filled plate to the cook and presto. Cooked up the way you like it. All of this and an assortment of ice creams as well as cakes cookies and fruit. You really cant go wrong.   End times buffet. Because so many buffets in phoenix are now defunct. Theirs a tiny margin left of what used to be before."}
{"text":"Definitely the best chinese buffet I've been to in this area.  They have sushi which is a plus and it's made fresh right there.  I like how big this buffet is too, you get options and it's pretty well priced.  I make the 15 minute drive at least once a month to come here."}
{"text":"The people who worked here were so rude! I came with my kids during lunch hours. Nobody was waiting and we stood there as 3 different workers just looked at us and didn't seat us. The guy at the front just kept looking didn't greet us, nothing. We waited 10 mins to be seated. The food was gross, and that guy who was staring earlier was rude to my kid when she went to get ice cream. I won't ever be going back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant smells like old fish and what might be a little mold. The stations are set up neatly and are clean, however the food isn't kept to temperature. My food with the exception of the soup was cold.  I had the wonton soup; hot but terrible chunk of cheap sausage in the wonton. I had the green beans and mushrooms which were great, the ginger crab which had no meat; made a mess to fight for nothing, and beef ribs that looked liked the best you'd ever had only to be tough, cold, and a gelatinous mess from all the fat. I had half a porkchop that may have been grilled but had an unfamiliar spice added; tough again.  The service though was as to be expected; 20 minutes for a refill of soda and a hot pot of tea that tasted like hot water and dirt. Another 15 minutes to tag a waitress for a check that clearly had better things to do then wait in me. A waste of 27 dollars."}
{"text":"Its the Super Buffet - lots of options, but some items were left a bit too long under the burners. Can be very crowed with lots of unruly children crawling all over the place as the one did that decided to share my booth with me, WTF take control of your kids please!  Service was a bit slow, but its open late if you have a craving and everything else is closed."}
{"text":"I was happy to see a Mongolian buffet after Hibachi closed.  Sorry to report, but this was a major disappointment.  Everything tasted stale.  Hope I don't get sick."}
{"text":"I went to this location a few weeks go, it was a great place to eat for the first time. I went with my family for my sisters 8th grade promotion."}
{"text":"Terrible, nasty!! omgosh don't go. People all over the place not knowing basic manners and the food was gross. I wont be surprised if I get sick tomorrow.  Diner beware!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place before and I liked it.Anyhow my husband and I stopped by for dinner on Saturday 6-9-18 and we had oysters Smh you wouldn't believe how sick we are! Vomiting diarrhea and bad stomach pains!! Today is Tuesday and still had to miss work!!! I called the place and the managers response was 'noone else got sick' Wth kinda response is that!! By no means am i looking for a free meal especially from there!But thy could've been more apologetic!  So be careful especially if u eat the oysters!better take a week off work if u do"}
{"text":"I don't expect much from buffets but there is a kind of minimum standard that you need to be above.  That being said, Mandarin didn't cut it.  The place does have freshness issues.  I made a decent enough taco but the salsa was obviously old.  When that's one of the first things you taste, it makes you a bit skeptical about everything else.  No rice cooker?  The white rice is put into a smallish bin that's usually low in supply.  The fried rice has an artificial look about it (bright colors?) and doesn't have much in the way of taste.  You don't have to have the best fried rice in the world but in the buffet game you have to make sure you don't have the worst.    Lots of chicken dishes, but I made the mistake of biting into a big piece that had lost most of it's coating, and it was a bland experience.  The kind of bland where it makes you think about how processed this food is.  Not a good reminder while eating.  The pizza just looks bad, the kind where the red sauce is just drying away.  I have such a low threshold on pizza quality that Totino's gets me excited, but what I saw at Mandarin didn't make me want to allocate calories to it.  I did try the famous tamale and it reminded me of the Hormel canned tamales.  Just reminder after reminder of the processed food....  Clean place, nice staff, fast seating, parking kind of sucks if the spots right out front are all taken.  At the end of the day there weren't those 1 or 2 go-to dishes that would make me want to return."}
{"text":"Good if you are in the mood for this type of deal. Only down fall is that they accept public assistant cards, so the crowd is nuts especially with a zillion kids running around with next to no supervision and at the perfect height to cough laugh sneeze all over the food. It's your call."}
{"text":"This is one of those all you can eat places that I actually approve. Food is always good, and I have not gotten sick.  Sounds like a win win!"}
{"text":"One 1/2 star for being near where I commute and therefore easy to get to.  One 1/2 star for having a wide variety of items.  One star for pricing, for all you can eat buffet, the pricing was good.  Minus one star for food quality - the food is not WOW, got to have more.  It is more, OK I can survive on this.  Minus one star for atmosphere.  This is a buffet factory.  Tons of people, loud noise, dirty floors some time (too much traffic).  Rush in, eat, rush out.    Minus one star - because \"Meh, i've experienced better.\"   This is next to a shopping mall and must get some good business from there.  It seems to always be busy.  Will I go again, sure, when short of time, dying for asian and I am in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went a month ago like I said little to dark a little pricey love  Mongolian grill would like to see some sweet and sour pork I can never find here in Az.  Little better price for seniors maybe a free drink included. Other wise a nice place to eat and good services."}
{"text":"Was visiting family over the Labor day weekend and we came here to have dinner. Why only one star? Our server/waiter was very unorganized. He wasn't collecting our plates soon enough, and they started to pile up. We order our drinks when we got sat down at our table and he forgot 3 drinks. He brought the check 20 minutes after we got there, at that point we felt like he wanted us to leave. Sorry but I am not going back ever!!!"}
{"text":"If i could give this place no stars I would. The waitress was very nice but the food was disgusting the floor was disgusting the counters were disgusting people had put used plates on our table seconds after we got there. The area we got seated in was over crowded and packed with loud and annoying people. We asked to be seated in a different area and they said no. I will never go back to this place. And I will not recommend it to anyone in the future."}
{"text":"This is the first time i have ever been here. My girlfriend has been here several times and really liked it. Also, my Brother and his son really like it as well. So I thought i would give it a try. I was happy i did. The selection was amazing!   There was a lot of seafood and all really fresh and good. Ice tea and soda are addtional charge, but, hot tea is included with the meal. Prices are good. Lots of parking, friendly staff."}
{"text":"The selection was quite encompassing - everything that made it onto the plate was delicious. Particularly enjoyed the dessert dishes. Would strongly recommend to those who enjoy lots of  buffet choices when dining out."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting! The crab legs had a foul smell and the rest of the buffet food was not that great. I do not recommend this place and I noticed the kitchen area was dirty. I knew it was a bad idea when I was washing my hands in the bathroom and someone was throwing up; and yes, the bathrooms are gross."}
{"text":"Used to come here occasionally but hadn't been in a year or two. A friend was hungry and wanted Chinese so we came here for lunch. About the only thing I thought had improved was the hot and sour soup which was actually quite good. Alas, nothing much else was up to snuff. The pot stickers were large but the size was more due to their thick and bulky wrapper. Like the other dishes they were lukewarm even though we were there at the noon hour peak. The fried rice was OK but the Kung Pao chicken was bland and a couple of the other chicken dishes seemed greasy. The sweet and sour chicken was OK if you like that dish. Didn't bother with the spring rolls and I'm not a fan of sushi so I have no opinion on those. The ice cream selection was good and decent quality. Service was adequate although they were a little slow in picking up the dirty dishes. Probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I stopped for dinner tonight with my daughter around 4ish and I'm in the bathroom puking out my brains.  Their Bathroom was yucky (first indicator that I should have left). Dried up Food on the legs of the table. The food was really disgusting. Pork was cold. I went up once for food at the buffet and told my daughter lets cash out. Worst $22 bucks spent. Might call out tomorrow for work."}
{"text":"This place was for me one of the worst buffets ever! I was really excited to go here after reading the review but was really disappointed with the food. The service and people were great but the food no where near that.   I was looking forward to the sushi, which was really bad I may add, so I then went to the buffet. The typical dishes were horrible and left a weird after taste. Even the soda we got was flat and had a really bad after taste.   The only thing I truest enjoyed was the Mongolian station."}
{"text":"The food was good but i didn't like how the waitress asking for tips! I was about to enjoy my ice cream after my meal but this lady came over to my table and gave me the check ( I didn't even get to eat my ice cream yet). I handed her my debit card, after few minutes she came back with the receipt and asked me to write Tips on it. \" here tips here, you write tips here\" wtf? I normally tips people more than 20% I even tip people at wings stop, pizza place or even at Starbucks! But this is very disrespectful! She was standing behind me waiting for me to write tips on the receipt. So I took my time eating my ice cream and this bitch was still there waiting for me until I tip her. She didn't serve or refill our drinks at all. This bitch better let me finish my food first!!! I don't eat Chinese food anymore because most of them are like this! Rude and disrespectful!"}
{"text":"Lots of variety here - nothing that stands out, but the old standbys of orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, barbecue pork, etc. are all satisfactory. The only thing I didn't really care for was (and this is my own fault for getting it) was a tamale.  I doubt I'd go back, but I suppose if I was in the area, I'd consider it."}
{"text":"2.5 stars I upped to three stars only because this one is light years better than some other Chinese buffets that I think are two star.  The stir fry part is actually is prepared with many sauces that a cook mixes for you instead of one bottled like sauce taste.   Lots of variety with different proteins and many stir fried pans, most dishes had decent flavor but many had too much oil.  Best dishes might be the Oyster Mushrooms.... or the pork dumplings?  Quality varies depending on your visit and also part of pan you pick from.  But BEWARE! of the Escolar and take only a bite or you will have problems in your pants. (see Escolar on Wikapedia it's banned in Italy for that reason) Escolar should never be on a buffet. (I already knew that)  Donuts are cinnamon sugared.  Pans were kept filled and the servers were very nice. Worth a try , better than some sit down Chinese Restaurants.  2.5 stars"}
{"text":"worst ever.  not real food.  just terrible.  I have to wonder how this place stays open all these years with the terrible quality food they have.  perhaps it was just a mass volume the inhabitants of this restaurant.  it's desert lacked flavor lacked texture, and ultimately made our cheat night meal very disappointing.  I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Let's just say this is not the best buffet out there. I came here last week for my sisters birthday and as soon as we walked in we were just standing there waiting to be seated... They had us wait for about 20 minutes which I don't understand because it was during the week so the place wasn't even full. Anyways once we finally got seated I got my food which was mediocre the same basic food you find chow mein fried shrimp etc. nothing special the sushi was alright but what can you expect it's a buffet. The staff wasn't very friendly they lacked interaction with customers kind of cold in a way."}
{"text":"Trying to think of a reason to come back. The music is too loud, the kids are screaming and running everywhere. The food isn't nearly as good as it was before and the price went up to boot. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"THE ONLY GOOD THING WAS THE POND!!! Why can't I give 0 stars? I ask because I went there last night and haven't been able to leave the bathroom today. The staff were rude, I got food poisoning,  and when I called the restaurant to let them know that I had food poisoning,  they curtly told me to \"go to the hospital,  I have insurance for that.\" I wonder if he had his response to a complaint of food borne illness  so down pat because it's a  common occurrence. I read good reviews of this place before we went,  but having been there for myself,  I think those reviewers were lying or compensated. Crappy plastic dishes,  no knives,  the food was bland, Mongolian grill cross contamination,  and my boyfriend and I were treated like criminals when I needed to step outside for a moment in the middle of the meal. I think the staff were suspicious we might \"dine and dash\". I was making a private call, and there was too much noise. If you are looking for food poisoning,  lousy service,  and generic bland Americanized Asian food,  I highly recommend this place. At $13 each for dinner,  I consider this a HUGE rip-off. By the way,  the moment you pay your tab, you cease to exist... good luck getting a beverage refill without shaking the ice in your cup at the server. There are a lot of better quality,  more budget friendly, and safer options for Asian buffet than this place. I feel victimized by circumstance of being in this geographical area and craving a big Asian meal. NEVER NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday for lunch. Fresh good food. Good salads. Food items are kept well stocked, and taste great. This is one of the better buffets we have found in the Glendale area. Will go back!"}
{"text":"The last two times I have eaten there I have gotten ill. One other time I went there and there was a guy out front throwing up in front of the entry doors and then he moved to the garbage can. I'm just not eating there anymore and I used to eat there at least twice a week but no more"}
{"text":"Love coming to this buffet, so far I have not gotten sick. I like the fact that they are open on Christmas. Both my husband and I love the Wonton Soup. Im very impressed with the guy that works at BBQ station, I cant remember his name but I like how he interacts with his customers, his tip jar is ALWAYS full! I always say he cooks the food with love. He is one of the main reasons I go back to this buffet. Once I get his name, I will update this review :) only reason why I give this buffet 4 stars, is because that restroom smells and its always dirty (at least when I go)!!! Sometimes you can't enjoy the food because of that smell. If you go, just sit on the right side where the BBQ is or that big glass room next to it. Just not close to that restroom."}
{"text":"I come here for the Mongolian BBQ.  I like the sauces they use to cook the veggies.   Makes for tasty stir fry noodles.  Also tasty are the mushrooms in oyster sauce and cracked pepper chicken.    The rest is so-so."}
{"text":"I had been here a couple of times before, I thought it was okay but not great. Yesterday we went there for an early dinner because a relative insisted that was the only buffet he likes. Today my 6 year old who only ate a small amount of teriyaki chicken and a couple of squares of jelly woke up in the middle of the night with stomach ache and vomiting the chicken. Also I think $150 for 4 adults and 4 kids who don't eat much is expensive. Will never be eating here again."}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing yesterday I wanted for lunch and I love it the bbq was delicious so many choices they all friendly.  Also my kids were happy because they have real ice cream and so much fruit and desert only for 7.99 and I had 15% discount.  I recommend this place is awesome.!!"}
{"text":"Place is pretty good after new ownership took affect. Pretty clean and organized. I would give the food 4/5 stars. Better than most chinese buffet places. Looks like all employees are actually Chinese. Your drink is always filled since they check up on it regularly. I actually had more than I could drink they filled it so often. Prices are good at $6.99 per person during lunch. Dinner is $9.99 per person. Children 3-5 is $2.99 as the check said. Soda is $1.49. And guess what, REAL ICE CREAM. We were pretty happy about that. Worth it."}
{"text":"Rand H, Norm R, Mike C and I ended up here after trying to go to Fu-Fu and they chose not to open at 11.  The place was clean.  It was busy enough nothing that I tried seem to be getting stale in the tray.  The staff was busily cleaning the serving area and clearing plates in the dining room.  I liked having the food pretty much centrally located.  Norm even managed to find a set of chop sticks."}
{"text":"Heads up to anyone thinking about eating here! I just found a dead cock roach in my daughter's orange chicken abput 2 hours ago! I am so repulsed and sick to my stomach. Do not, I repeat,  DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews after we ate our dinner and am surprised.  The reviews run from great to terrible with few reviews in between, so people either love this place or hate it.  I don't love this place but the food was good, hot and a huge variety.  The staff kept the floors clean and were ready to serve.  I am not sure what people expect for a lunch meal under $10 but this meal was definitely worth the money.  We don't get down t this area often but if we find ourselves near here we will eat here again."}
{"text":"I was forced by family to visit and We LOVED the place.  The steamed fish, sushi,  chicken & vegetables were all fantastic. I will be back."}
{"text":"The food and service is horrible. They say us down and got us our drinks but didn't check up on us until like 1 hour later. The broccoli beef and chicken were under seasoned and tasted nasty. The sushi rice was hard and obviously not fresh. The only decent thing were the chicken wings. If you're looking for a cheap place to fill you up like fast food joints, this is your place"}
{"text":"Mongolian grill is the best part of the meal. The desert cakes were good.  It's was 50 for 2 adults 2 kids.  We came kinda late after 8. Food was half edible. There is plenty of choices that's for sure. Some good some bad."}
{"text":"This other table was being disruptive, and told their kids they were going to beat them.  We nicely said, \"Please keep it down, you're cussing in front of our kids.\" She then threatened to kick our butts, and beat OUR kids! We told the manager, and they said \"Maybe she's crazy.\" No apology or anything. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"We just missed the lunch buffet so opted for the dinner buffet.  We found the food to be good especially if you make it a point to eat the freshly made food.  I tried the BBQ area similar to a Mongolian grill.  You pick your goodies and someone will cook it for you.  The food is piping hot and you're know it is fresh.  If in doubt, don't eat it.  The sushi was very regular; all veggie no fish.  I skipped that stop.  There are better buffets but if in the area, this is passable."}
{"text":"I found egg shell in my fried rice, need I say more?? To sum it up, I will not return. The food is very bland, and not well prepared. Don't waste your time or money"}
{"text":"This place is not terrible; not great either. I really like the much-maligned tamales. If not burned, the wings and breaded chicken are good. Veggies and mushrooms generally tasty. I *almost* iike the garlic green beans, but they have this strange waxy aftertaste. Can't quite describe it. Crab puffs, reasonable for a buffet. Avoid varying-quality ribs and fatty house special chicken. Stuffed crab shells and egg patties yummy. Pot stickers and tacos not terrible. Avoid hot and sour soup unless you like hot and sour soup generally. Think that's most of what I tried."}
{"text":"Has horrible food.  I love Chinese food and this place is pretty bad.  I went back three times hoping they have improved, but left disappointed every time. Not worth what I paid for."}
{"text":"Was a bit worried going there after reviews, but went any way. Sometimes you need an adventure. Well, it was better than expected but not great. As a vegetarian the options were truely limited. Green beans, lo mein, potatoes and salad. It did however offer tons of meat options for people who enjoy such items. We arrived right after openung and everything looked fresh. Service was ok. At $10.99 you cant complain about price. I gave it a two star rating more for overall lack of appeal and worn diningroom. My green beans were fresh and tasty. Lo mein was buffet quality. Probably wont go out of my way to go back, but not as bad as some have said here."}
{"text":"Parking lot is somewhat small and seems poorly laid out based on the way people had parked.  Just seemed like too many cars were incapable of maneuvering between the painted lines.   Restaurant looks fairly large and buffet tables are visible upon entering. There is a meeting room in the back which we used for a club meeting. Didn't seem as if they were even prepared for our group to be there. Rugs were in a pile in the corner of the room and the floor was stick gross.  My shoes were stuck and made noise each time I lifted a foot.  Annoyingly gross. Tables were basic conference type tables with napkin holder and soy sauce bottles strategically placed. I think they could do a little more to make this a very useful meeting area and potentially create a better draw.  Start by mopping the floors would be a good place to start.   I did not eat.  Food smelled alright but I'm not very fond of buffet Chinese and I just feel sushi doesn't belong on any buffet."}
{"text":"The reviews here seem to be either very low or very good, no middle ground. We've eaten here twice. The first time I was pleasantly surprised, the food was very good, not common for buffets in this city which have gotten worse over the years. The Squid, fried foods, noodles, rice and meat dishes were well prepared. The bathroom needs better cleaning as does the floor. I would have given this 4 stars but for the second visit. The chow mein noodles were done very differently than the time before, with a bad taste. The fried rice, completely different, was inedible. The other foods were as good as before, but to me, noodles and rice are the anchor for this type of buffet food and I was disappointed. I can't review the sushi, as I don't believe in eating raw meat and fish of any kind, just because it's trendy."}
{"text":"It was ok for a buffet. We had to wait for a table in which we thought if we were waiting then it was going to be awesome. The food was mediocre & selection was alright.  Standard beef broccoli, sweet & sour chicken , & rangoon. But nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I was impressed how how nice the place look when I first walked in. Very clean with warm lighting and different seating section. There is also a fish pond at the entrance. Since it just barely open, everything look new and clean.  I was looking forward to sushi but it was a disappointment. The rice was not soft and the sushi doesn't seem very fresh. There seafood is not much, just crawfishes and deep fried soft shelf crabs. Don't expect any big steam crab legs since the price is $9.99 dinner. They also having mongolian BBQ but I didn't try it.  There wasn't really much other exciting selections that stand out. Overall the food was just okay if you want to fill your stomach"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time the food was hot and good and there was a large variety of seafood and Chinese  food. The price was good also ."}
{"text":"Every single time that I come to this place I order raspberry tea and start eating lime a deamon I really love the food from this place"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. dont waste your time or money. I tried several items, convinced i could find something, anything good. Let me leave you with this - even the pudding was disgusting. Like a watered down version of something from a can."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in 5 years. I gave it another try. EWW! It was gross. We went at a busy time. Lots people so food was coming out fresh and I didn't want any of it.  Just Don't......"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday. This included crab legs that weren't good, crawfish and fresh oysters (Not a chance I'm eating oysters off a buffet). $12.39.  The food: Lots of choices, but not everything is good. No sesame chicken, no general tso chicken and no egg rolls! Only spring rolls and a few simple chicken dishes. They do have 5-6 soups, a good salad bar and fresh Mongolian BBQ. Lots of the things on the menu made me question why they were there on a chines buffet (french fries and cheesy spinach?). The food was very fresh though, but it may have been a product of how busy it was. Dim Sum was undercooked  (still very pink and soft) and that's not good for pork.   The service: It was packed when I went, but it seemed reasonable for a buffet... I wasn't there for table service and wine suggestions.   Headache: This place had a very long wait. Probably 40 people were waiting to be seated when we left at 2pm on a Sunday. Children were throwing food and climbing all over the place. Very irritating. The only positive I could gather was a fantastic opportunity for people watching. This place included every walk of life.   Overall: If you're looking for a buffet with fresh food and a decent selection, you could head here. Based on the lack of multiple Chinese buffet staples, I probably wouldn't head back, or at least on a busy Sunday with higher prices. Maybe try a lunch. They also serve beer.   Note - They do offer buffet to go and pay by the pound. This might be a decent option considering the food is fresh."}
{"text":"The food is horrible. Only had half a plate and I was dissatisfied with what I chose. We have tried a lot of different places and this by far is the worst. The noodles are greasy and tastless. The sweet and sour sauce tasted like sugar and water with red dye. Wish we read the reviews first."}
{"text":"PASS. Not good and not clean. Poor quality,  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I went here with my husband ,friend and granddaughter. My friend and I ordered just a water with our meal and they gave use tap water no ice . This have never ever happened to me before. No ice come on . We won't be back and I do love thier won tons"}
{"text":"The stale fortune cookie was the final insult.  Of course, since I came in alone with a book, I was seated in the darkest dining area next to a table with screaming children. This should have been my sign that the staff already knew I was not their target clientele and were determined to extract my $14 with the least effort to themselves.   Standard Chinese buffet food must come in vast tubs from Sysco, as the Chinese dishes are absolutely identical to the Chinese dishes at every other mediocre buffet in Phoenix. This one appears to have a larger selection of non-Chinese food, including the mysterious pork tamale mentioned by others. It all tastes as if it was poured from its tub into a pan, heated through, and then trotted out to sit on its warming table. If you're determined to stuff mass quantities of food down your gullet, this will probably do the job. If you have the food sensitivity that gives stomach cramps in response to one or another cheap fat or filler, don't even walk in the door. There's fast food elsewhere in the parking lot that'll fill you up for half the price and a fraction of the misery.  The iced tea has no flavor that would confirm it's anything other than maybe used dish water, so I suppose I shouldn't complain about lack of refills. Lack of knives is more of an issue if you're recklessly served yourself a slice of ham, but. . . don't. It should be impossible to eff up buffet ham, but the ham was tasteless, with a bizarre gummy texture. After that, I was not about to try the sushi.  High points for food were the spicy squid whatevers, the breading-and-fish concoctions in assorted seashells (those have to be pretty awful before I don't think they're adorable), and the fake tiramisu squares (standard buffet fare but this was a fresh batch)."}
{"text":"Huge variety and constantly putting out fresh food. Friendly staff, big area no waiting for seats also hibachi chef ready to serve."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch around 1:30 and it looked to me as if the food was mostly the same since opening. You could tell that it was not fresh and several things were out and never replaced during our visit. This place works off of volume, sort of the WalMart of Americanized Chinese poorly done food. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Beaucoup de choix dans le buffet mais la Nourriture n était pas  tres fraiche, le service est ok"}
{"text":"So, on Christmas day I was doing the traditional fanfair of eating chinese and going to a movie.  I ended up skipping the movie, and came here for dinner instead. I've driven by this place plenty, since its a few miles south of where I live.  I've never eaten here before, but stopped in yesterday to grab some dinner.  Upon entering, I found the prices to be fair.  $9.99 for an all you can eat chinese buffet with a decent variety of food.  I surveyed the buffet area and grabbed my share of food.  Here's some of what I found while dining here.  They had a selection of some sushi, mexican food and tons of chinese food.  They had a decent selection of soups, and I went with the egg drop soup. Hot, tasty, and went down oh so good.  Had some sushi, and that was okay. Not the best, but seemed to get the job done.  Skipped the mexican and went right for the chinese food. I sampled a few dishes, and all were pretty tasty.  Orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, Lo Mein noodles, all good.  I think they even have alcoholic beverages for sale! I saw some booze on the back wall, but I didn't order any. Pretty neat that they sell booze!  The downer? Desert section was aweful! Not only was there a crap selection, but it was hit beyond belief.  Most of the trays were all but gone and picked over when I was there.  Selection was seriously limited to putting, some very dry and bad tasting cake thingys, and some peaches in syrup. I went with the peaches because they had tons of ice cream, and with the weather being cold, I didn't want any ice cream. Desert area was just a fail over all.  Not the best buffet, but not the worst. Food was okay, prices were fair, and there was a decent amount of seating.  I can't say I'll never be back, but considering it was open on christmas day, and some of the food was okay, I gave it 3 stars.  Just okay really."}
{"text":"WOW! This place was by far the filthiest place I've ever been to. The waiters and waitresses were so friendly but that was about the only good thing. Bland food and food that tastes like tap water. The rest room reeked. Terrible, eat at home, you'll be better off!"}
{"text":"I never felt like I was eating anything here that was obviously old or artificial. Get any chicken dish, they're all high quality.   Get the sushi as well. Nine out of ten times I'll have sushi at buffets, but Mandarin really churns out the California rolls fast and with relatively high quality stuff. Yes, I just said \"quality\" and \"California rolls\" in the same sentence.   There are like at least a dozen different items I'll eat from here, and when I'm done I'll say dessert is also totally worth it. And it's not even that expensive!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant twice. The first time was so bad we wanted to give them a chance to earn our business. The service was lousy. The staff very rude and when asked to refill an item it took over 15 mins. The food also was mediocre  at best it was often cold or just room temperature. The item we requested refilled came out cold."}
{"text":"Ever since moving to the west valley, my fiance and I have been looking for a buffet place to replace our favorite, Crazy Buffet.  This one might just be a winner!  There is a large selection of food choices here as well as sushi.  For the dinner and weekend price of $9.99 per person, you just cannot beat it!  The food was very well prepared and very tasty.  The sushi was excellently prepared as well.  The service was good and the place was clean.  Also, if you like koi ponds, this buffet has one in the very front with large and small koi fish and a turtle!"}
{"text":"Food is average. The smell of bad raw seafood when you walk in is overpowering. Most of what I ate was good but the beef and broccoli was tasteless and bland. A couple items were like that. The food temp was not quite hot enough. It was very busy so that is why we stopped. Not going back."}
{"text":"I came here with two of my neighbors to get of the house and enjoy a meal out.The restaurant itself is NOT what I would call high-class cuisine, but it's not bad for what it is either.  They serve a variety of dishes that range from lemon shrimp, beef broccoli,salt&pepper beef, sushi, and desserts as well.The service was fine but all the server does is make sure that your drinks are refilled and you serve yourself at the buffet."}
{"text":"You haven't lived until you have heard impromptu-Samoan-Christian-gangsing at a Chinese buffet.   And I am glad I was there to witness it.  It's reliable. Nothing bad or gross. They have the sushi (just ok) and reasonably-good Mongolian BBQ. The main dishes are consistently tasty and fresh. It's rather clean. If you have the Val-Pak app on your phone, you can get 15% off your total check.   Check out the koi pond with the turtles."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for buffets, lots of choices and sushi so this place makes me happy. Prices are pretty decent considering you have sushi on top of a multitude of other eating options, traditional Chinese food (well, American version), other tastes such as tacos, fries, dessert bar and salad bar. Some foods get a little tough sitting there but all is properly hot or cold like they should be. Only taking off a star because they really need to do some renovating in areas (flooring) and it doesn't make it look too appealing. Oh and love seeing the fish and turtles in the pond when you arrive and leave! :)"}
{"text":"Some of the Staff barely know English the food selection is great but the quality of the food is very low. Visited at 7:30 p.m. for dinner and plates are dirty the floor is dirty and ot was just a bad experience"}
{"text":"Two hungry girls saw this on the road and wanted to try something different.  The lunch menus is only 7. 99!!  We immediately pulled over. For the amount of food you get this is an unbeatable deal and soft drinks are only 1. 79 with free refills!  The food: we didn't see lot of seafood out during lunch and only tried the shrimp which was next to the ice cream.  But their was a lot of Chinese food that you would find at a regular take out place.  The siu mai  I tried was still a little pink and the orange chicken had a funny after taste.    However,  the Mongolian BBQ and steamed fish,  chow mein were good.  Overall,  stay away from the old stuff or anything artificially pink like the fried rice and you'll be OK.  If you have a large group and hungry kids on a budget this is worth it for the deal. The place could use some more love cleaning and decor wise but it's a wallet-friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"After today, I can now understand how other have given low reviews. I could not understand it before today! We go here often as it is a central location for family to meet (family lives all over the Valley) and usually it is very good!! Today, a Saturday, our first weekend visit ever, was very disappointing!!!   Many of my favorites were replaced for the weekend with stuff I personally don't like. Not only that, but it seems as if they were prepared for the larger crowd with a lot of replacement food prepared way too far in advance, so when they put out \"fresh food\" it was actually already cold.   Our entire party all left disappointed!! Such a bummer because we were celebrating Father's Day a day early. It was my dad's idea to eat/meet here because usually it is very good! NOT today!!!"}
{"text":"Because of the recent reviews I have kind of stayed away from this place but I braved it the other day and realized I was wrong. Now don't get me wrong, this place can sometimes be hit or miss, but Monday night it was a definite hit. They had 6 different soups, a din sum and taco bar all set up on the back table.... also tamales... wasn't expecting those but hey... The Mongolian grill had 4 different types of meat to choose from and there were several different sushi options to choose from. Various chickens were all pretty good, and they had ribs, roast beef, and pork loins as well... they had a decent salad bar and different ice creams for desert as well as a desert bar but I just had room for ice cream after.... peanut butter and fudge, cookies and cream, butter pecan, and coffee... a small spoon of each. $10 and change for the dinner buffet. I most likely will be back fairly soon."}
{"text":"Having grown up in SoCal, I knew where all the premium Chinese restaurants were. Since moving her a few months ago, I've been on a quest to find two things. 1) the best chili dog. 2) the best Chinese/Asian cuisine. I was shocked to find, one full buffet table with quasi Mexican food. That's something I wouldn't expect to find at an Asian themed restaurant. No Chili Dogs? What gives? I don't get that, but...    They boast having over 150 items to chose from. That may very well be correct, although I only sampled/stuffed myself with a mere fraction of that. The service was great. I was greeted and seated right away. I was then greeted by my server immediately and asked what I'd like to drink. My experience in the business prompts me to live by one very important standard, Tip your server.  To Insure Proper Service = TIPS  That in mind, I gave Miss Amy a five dollar tip upon receiving my Diet Pepsi. From that point on, my table was kept clean and free of mounding dishes. My cup never went below half empty. The selection of food was enormous and for the Holliday price of $10.99, wow, what a deal. Based on the quality of the food, the selection and the attentiveness of my server, I would gladly pay $14-15 for the experience. I will be back and would recommend this fine establishment without hesitation. The jalapeno octopus was superb."}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me to this place around late 2012. I remember it being so good that I suggested we go back. Today, it wasn't as great as I remembered. This has become another one of those places where management seems to have simply given up. Everything in the dessert station was at least a day old. The food was underwhelming. The tables were not cleaned well and all of the \"clean\" plates still had some food debris left on them. That was very unappetizing. I would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I don't get the positive reviews here.  Ok, well... you walk in and think, \"I've gone to Calorie Heaven!\"  But then you sit down to eat and BLEEEEHHHH.  The only thing that we tried that was marginally ok was the fried rice and the orange chicken- but WAY sweet.  Most of the food was really not very warm- in fact barely warm and mostly tastless.  The egg drop soup was down right yucky and the beef/broccoli totally chewy.  The spring rolls were anything but fresh- obviously frozen and rewarmed which I expected, but they were barely warm.    The Chow mein seriously had no taste.  We only took one plateful and pretty much lost our appetite and left.  I really didn't expect much and figured it would be over sauced American Chinese and was actually up for that, but it was like what you'd expect in a really bad college or nursing home cafeteria.  We won't be back, but we wanted to like it for a splurge girls lunch out.  So sad.   And then the koi pond.  Um, koi like greenery, foliage... pop some lilypads in there at the very least.  It was like a tiled bathtub with fish in it.  I felt sorry for them and for us when we left. :-("}
{"text":"saturday at 2 : 30 pm - pre costco visit surprisingly attractive inside - but food was bland and lukewarm at best - I kept flashing back to Restaurant Impossible rants about food temps.  although plate removal and refills were prompt - was disapointed in everything else! I won't be back sorry. save your money and eat at home!"}
{"text":"Actually good food for a decent price,  Mongolian grill was excellent,  only tried the chicken choices in the buffet,  fresh and cooked well. Service was ok,  entire restaurant was well maintained,  no funny odors just fresh food.  Nice selection of desserts also...  Definitely will visit in the future,  highly recommend"}
{"text":"Good spread, good service, for people like us who do not eat meat, we over paid from the price point. Overall, for good eaters, I'm sure this would be a great filler!"}
{"text":"Went a couple of days ago. It came out to 50 dollars for 4 people. The food was barely edible and not hot but just warm. Also saw a cockroach there and instantly lost my appetite. Probably will never come to this place again."}
{"text":"TWO STARS FOR THE FOOD. FOR THE SERVICE NO STARS. First time we were there, they were giving out the coupons and barely just opened. The service was fine, the food to me was good. Second time we were there, food was fine but they would seat us inside a room with windows on the side with the scenery of some trees and a brick wall. TURNS OUT the waitress who serves our drinks was sitting behind us staring at us eating the WHOLE ENTIRE TIME. As if she had nothing better to do. She was on her phone. Third and last time we decided to come there same seating same waitress. STARING AT US THE ENTIRE TIME as she eats again and i remember this distinctly because as i got up to go get another plate her eyes literally followed me into the buffet area. IT WAS SO UNCOMFORTABLE, I couldn't even enjoy myself. I don't know if it was our age group or something. My fiance was eating alone when he noticed a man with his arms crossed who worked there staring at him right outside the door. Like he wasn't even trying to hide it. My fiance notices and looks right at him and he just stares him down with his arms crossed until another man approached the worker. The waitress even gave us our checks early and my fiance and i were not even done eating and she would come by and peek at us, trying to force us out not in a forward way. As she came back with receipt for a signature she literally stood there the whole time waiting for me to sign the receipt and check for her tip. NO TIP LADY. I thought i'd keep giving this place a chance since I love Asian buffets but I WILL NOT BE GOING HERE NO MORE. Come here if you want to be stalked like a hawk as if you're in there to dine and dash!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited at 3pm on a weekday for lunch. Priced at $7.99 for lunch, I wasn't expecting much selection or freshness.  Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised.  Selection was huge and although there wasn't much of a crowd at the time, they brought out just enough that everything appeared fresh.   I was pleased to see their selection of California rolls and look forward to going back during dinner hours to taste their sushi. Staff was friendly. We will be back."}
{"text":"I have been in search of the perfect chinese buffet since I moved down to Phoenix from the midwest and had been pretty unsuccessful until the mandarin Super Buffet Opened.  There is a huge selection of food with most of the things you would expect to find at a buffet. I think it just tastes so much better here! I don't know if it's brought out more regularly or just made with love but it's soooo good! Among my favorites are the dim sum, meatballs, honey chicken, spicy chicken, and pizza. Yes, I said pizza. I don't know why but I would almost go here just to eat the pizza! So good and cheesy with just a little sauce! Mmm Mmm Mmm!  The reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the atmosphere. Now don't get me wrong, I know that a buffet isn't going to be the most classy environment. It's clean and well kept but it is really loud and every time I have been there, there are kids literally running around all over the place.   I would give the food 4 stars and atmosphere 2 stars - hence the 3 star rating."}
{"text":"Not the best but for $6 I can get lots of good takeout, and the selection is slightly better than other buffets in this price range. Stop bitching people!  It is only $4.50 a pound for takeout."}
{"text":"My friends and I all live on campus. Occasionally, we would go to Christown spectrum to do some shopping. We got hungry one day and wanted something other than fast food. This buffet was right next to us so we decided to try it. My friends were skeptical because of where the restarting is located. However we looked up the reviews on it and saw some pretty good reviews. We decided to try this place.   When we entered, the restaurant had a mini pond-like fountain. It was pretty cool! We were attended to right away and seated. Got served drinks then we got to pick our food.   This buffet, I'm telling you, has a lot of choices! Not only does it have Chinese food, they have Mexican food as well! There were tamales which I love! They were good! There was pizza at this buffet. A great amount of options. This buffet even had seafood! And the food are good. I would totally recommend this place. Totally better than Panda Express or other basic Chinese food places."}
