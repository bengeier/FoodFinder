{"text":"I think it was overpriced for what it is. Food was good but expensive. I had chicken with olives and my sister had linguine and clams. We had appetizers and a bottle of wine and split a dessert. Total was $130.00. I think you can do better."}
{"text":"One detail I over-looked while planning a wedding was a gift for out-of-town guests. At the very last minute (like, 3 days before the event) I stopped into this store in a panic hoping they might be able to help!  And WOW was I glad I stopped in!!!!  I was greeted with a friendly face and an amazingly helpful individual who gave me some basic info about what could be done with regard to gift baskets. The choices were immense and so she simply asked for a budget so she could tailor her recommendations accordingly.  We said \"$25 per basket\" and she said \"OK\". No hustling or suggesting a higher price point.  Rather, she put together a simply PERFECT package that looked like it cost closer to $100.  It included a nice bottle of wine, crackers with a fancy looking spread, nuts, and chocolate among other things and placed into a beautiful little basket (I wish I new how to put a picture on here) AND was delivered BEFORE our wedding day.  I also smelled the food while planning our wedding favors and will definitely be going back for more.  THANK YOU, La Campagna, for saving me some serious wedding stress and for delivering such a perfect and well put together item for our guests."}
{"text":"What an amazing hidden secret!!!! I have lived right down the street for years and didn't know this existed. The service was great the food was absolutely wonderful. Definitely plan on spending some money, but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp and thought we would give it a try. Sat at the table for over 5 minutes without anyone even offering water. There were only 3 other tables who already had their food. We left and went to carraba's which is always excellent!"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in Clevelland! Portions are just right and the food is always A1 quality."}
{"text":"We have gone to La Campagna for years, though we call it \"Carmella's,\" for the chef and co-owner. It is a family-owned, family-run diamond in the rough of the West Side suburbs.  The menu changes at least a little bit every day, though many of my favorites (pasta bolognese and eggplant parmigiana) show up with frequency.    But every item on the menu has some reason to shine: the pizza crust may be made with fat from a locally raised pork, the cannoli may be filled with local goat cheese, and the tagliatelle are certainly homemade.  The wine list is often full of surprises; we usually just go with recommendations from the house.  The restaurant probably can only seat 25 (it's inside a gift basket/italian dry goods store), so we always call ahead for big groups.  Is it fancy? No. But it is delicious, and a bit like home. Or maybe more like your favorite aunt's house, if you grew up in a big, Italian-American family like mine."}
{"text":"First, I have to say that the food here is amazing!  However, on our first and only visit, we were seated at one of the two tables for 8 guests, and that one happened to be near the front door on a very cold winter Saturday night.  I asked if we could have the other table and our server gave me some idiotic explanation about not being able to move parties of different sizes!  8=8 the last time I looked!  Anyway, I tried to let it go but then we had to go through 12-15 menu items without a hard copy in front of us, so she had to repeat the items several times; insult was added to injury when no one had any idea what the prices were for the entrees.  So, in the end, even though we all had amazing meals, we were shocked at the cost AND felt as though we weren't very important guests - in fact, it appeared that the other table for 8 was saved for friends or  a more familiar clientele.  Service is every bit important as the food, and this place severely lacks the former."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Thursday by myself around 1800 ... place is small ... there were four diners and a waitress and a heavy set guy, perhaps a waiter ... stood by the door for about five minutes and Mr. Heavy Set who wasn't doing much of anything wanders over and asks if i have a reservation ... replied that no, i did not ... \"ahhh well then we can't ...\" he says as i stare at all the empty tables ... ah, okay, maybe they get crowded later and the whole place fills ... heard the food was good, but Mr. Heavy Set's attitude clearly said he could care less ... won't bother going back"}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin. This is hands down my favorite restaurant ever. My husband and I went on a recommendation and could not even believe it. From the outside it looks like a gift shop but I like that because this restaurant is truly a diamond in the rough. Completely authentic Italian food from imported and local sources. The chef makes the experience truly unique and the waitstaff is friendly and knowledgeable. I came here for my Birthday and a wine pairing dinner and am completely obsessed with this place."}
{"text":"Here's the deal - don't go if you want slick service. Don't go if you want a typical corporate restaurant atmosphere. Don't go if you are not willing to pay a little extra for fresh, local, quality ingredients. Go to La Campagna if you want authentic, honest-to-God homemade Italian food. The last time I had food this good was in Sicily. Carmella is the chef and owner and her pasta dishes are the best you will have in Cleveland."}
{"text":"HOLY GAWD. I can't believe it took me so long to find this place. I rank this alongside the best Italian restaurants EVER, not only in the Cleveland area. A tad pricey, but who really cares, because like I said, HOLY GAWD. It's that good.   Get the burrata. Just get it.  Get the eggplant parm if you want to taste eggplant parm the way it's supposed to taste.  Even the soup, which comes along with the meal (or a salad, if you wish) was redonk. And it wasn't even a \"wow\" type of soup -- just mushroom barley. Still amazing.  The wine. OH, the wine. They have a funny, interesting, clever story that goes along with their license to serve alcohol. I won't bother explaining it. Bottom line is, they have a tasting license, so you can buy wine and they can offer it to you in servings once you finish your glass. The wine is everywhere; it can't be ignored. JUST BUY THE WINE. AND DRINK THE WINE. I had Amarone for the first time ever...this is my new favorite wine.  Everything, from the intimate vibe, to the \"oops, are we in the right place?\" setting, to the same lady serving everyone who's served everyone since the beginning of time, along with her whole family, talking to you, serving you, and loving on you Italian restaurant style...is perfect.  Five thousand stars."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for a wine paired dinner.  The restaurant is small and intimate.  The event was fun.  The food and wine were great.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness...what a delight to find this place.  My husband and I got there on the early side, thank goodness!  All tables had reserved signs, but the server kindly put us at a table.  Next time we will make reservations.  My husband had a red pepper pasta with shrimp and an oil sauce, and I had the fig and mascarpone ravioli.  Both delicious!!  Salads of mixed greens, tomatoes and cucumbers - mine with an orange hazelnut dressing - oh so good!  Everything was so fresh and delicious.  We also had dessert - good choice!  Lemon blueberry layer cake, and a lemoncello gelato.  Absolutely scrumptious!  The prices were a little higher than we have paid in the area but the food was so much better than elsewhere...worth every penny.  We have tried a lot of Italian restaurants in the area and this beats anything, even Little Italy.  We will be back!  The live music was nice too - people in the restaurant were singing along - don't find that too often!  The decor was a little dated, but we were there for the food, and the place is so small and quaint that it has its own charm."}
{"text":"Hard to find but worth it!  Food was REMARKABLE!!! The wine was awesome!!!  The menu is created daily!!!  My husband had the spaghetti and meats balls... The pasta was cooked perfectly!!  I had pasta with tomatoes and acorn squash... It was outstanding!!  Even their homemade salad dressings were great!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Nothing short of perfection. This down home little gem is what real Italian cuisine is all about. Great food, great wine, bella famiglia!"}
{"text":"GO.   Just GO!  If you love freshly prepared Italian food made with locally sourced ingredients, this is the place.  Camilla, the owner, is a real sweetheart, and makes sure that everything that leaves her kitchen is top notch.  Did you GO yet?"}
{"text":"Everyone rants about this place but honestly I think it is over rated. It is very expensive compared to other similar restaurants. I have been there twice and I will not be back. First off, I ordered a glass of wine and I was served a very small portion and asked the server why there was such a small amount and she said they only have a \"tasting\" license. I wish she would have explained that up front because I paid $6.99 for a taste of wine, The salad was good but very small, small portion of bread. It seemed everything was small but the prices. I had the pasta and clams, it was very watery and not much taste. In my opinion, Stino's in Rocky River has traditional Italian food that is far superior to this place."}
{"text":"Its ok but if you are Italian and use to eating your Mamma's cooking you will not be impressed.  Now the non Italians that I was with thought the food was good not as good as when I cook but they enjoyed it.  Don't complain about the help they are all related."}
{"text":"Delicious home made Italian food. Simple but delicious with interesting ingredient twists."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Italian food, as good as it gets.  Everything is made to order, so sit back, relax, have a glass of wine and anticipate one of the finest meals you will have in Cleveland or anyplace else."}
{"text":"We had the most enjoyable time at La Campagne this evening.  The food was delicious (I had the buffalo mozzarella and eggplant Parmesan and my husband a pesto chicken pasta) and the family atmosphere was even more delightful. The service was very friendly and we truly felt we ate at a friends home. We will surely come back - maybe for a wine night! Thanks Carmella, Kelly and team. You were great."}
{"text":"Disappointed for the second time! The people that work there are not friendly and you have to ask for everything because they don't check back with you. They only serve a 2 oz. glass of \"tasting\" wine. There is no wine list or pricing for bottles of wine unless you flag someone down and ask. By the way, if you order a bottle they won't bring it to your table and leave it. The food is good but not great for $25-$28 an entree. Too many great places nearby that make you feel they're glad you're there! Hope this place sinks with all the new competition."}
{"text":"Wonderful quaint restaurant in Westlake. Hidden in a strip mall this family run restaurant is a gem. Entertained some friends at our new favorite restaurant La Campana and  could not be happier. Excellent menu that is described by the chef and owner. Excellent quality and very tasty. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"better than italy  westside hidden gem  save room for dessert - the best cheesecake  will stroll out satisfied  try the via vecchia wine  go there"}
{"text":"La Campagna is a down home awesome italian dining.  When you walk in for the first  time, you might be a bit confused by the decor.  The interior decor is shelves with packages of pasta, sauces, and even wine and all of these are actually for sale.  Nestled amongst these are several tables with seating for at most 40 patrons.  The decor does strike a nice of balance of your Italian grandparent's extended kitchen/dining space.  During my last visit, my two year old & I have discovered our latest favorite spiral pasta named \"fusilli col buco\" - This is a long version of the spring-shaped fusilli.   Reservations are highly recommended as very rarely walk-ins can be seated in a decent amount of wait time.  There is no set menu at La Campagna.  This truly family owned establishment decide upon their dinner menu each day and typically have soup, salad, and 4 to 5 items on that day's menu.  My several visits here have never been disappointing due to the food. Each entre is hand made after your order.  I don't think anything short of the pasta sauce and meat balls are pre-made at La Campagna.   Therefore once you order be prepared to wait a little.  But oh the taste and freshness of the dishes is to die for.  Chicken marsala to White fish with capers, finger licking good.  Now italian is not my most favorite cuisine, but eating at La Campagna makes me wish it was.   If you are craving italian and you can simmer in the craving for a day or so,  make a reservation at La Campagna and order multiple entrees and share or even take it home.   You will not regret.   The price range of all items are very reasonable compared to the taste.  Although the tables are white linen, the serving is not that of a high end white linen restaurant however if your expectation is to sit down at a true down home italian then the atmosphere and service quality will be perfect.  The last word on La Campagna - if you like Italian and appreciate great quality in your italian and have not yet tried La Campagna, I ask you 'Why not?!'"}
{"text":"La Campagna is the best hidden gem I've found in the city of Cleveland thus far. Located in Westlake in a small shopping center, you would never know what you're about to get yourself into when you step inside. There are maybe 8-10 tables in the entire restaurant. There are wine bottles from all areas of the world that line the walls. They sell them at wholesale value. Due to the fact that they have a \"tasting\" license, they cannot leave the bottle at the table so when you're ready for a refill, they bring the bottle over and pour you more. We started with the buffala mozzarella as our appetizer. If you have never tried buffalo, you are missing out on life. When you cut it into it, the milk juices ooze out. It's the creamiest, tastiest mozzarella cheese. It came served caprese style, with basil and tomatoes along with bread on the side. For my main dish, I had the eggplant parmesan. I strongly recommend getting this. It's the best eggplant parm I've ever had!! The eggplant was cut very thinly and was perfectly cooked. The sauce has good taste with just the right amount of herb to tomato ratio. A must try! We were too full after all of this for dessert, but I'm sure that they're all very good as well."}
{"text":"Farm to Table at its best.  Seasonal Veggies and local when available food is excellent and is not only tasty but visually beautiful.  This is a place I go regularly and would (and have) recommended to all.   I love the perch on Friday's during lent, the feast of Seven Fishes the first and second Friday of December.  If you see Halibut Florentine (many times Salmon) just order it you will not be sorry! We all love Eggplant Parmesan is so much we order it as appetizer.    You get soup or salad with meal and the prices are in line with just about any good restaurant in the area.  Wine selection is great and costs are really reasonable.  The place is small call ahead for reservation."}
{"text":"5 stars for food, folks and atmosphere. Chicken Marsala dish was outstanding, salad was good, lasagna was great and service was the best. We felt like we were in their home. They treated us like family. It is a small place, so I suggest reservations. We will go back!"}
{"text":"Not your normal dining experience. If you are looking for an evening out to enjoy a great bottle of wine, you can get that bottle, you just can't enjoy it. Disappointed with the tasting only service. You will find yourself waiting too long for your next taste. Definitely a local favorite. Not someplace you would go out of your way for. Average food at best."}
{"text":"Horribly overpriced for the quality of the food you recieve.  My dinner was $30 for Salmon a la orange that came with three pieces of vegetables and undercooked red skinned potatoes sprinkled with dried parsley.  The salmon was average at best.   The server, although nice, was slow, inattentive and was not able to answer basic question about the meal beforehand.    I am so disappointed.  I wanted to support a small, family owned business; but I left feeling like I got cheated out of my money for the illusion of an authentic experience.  So sad."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome home Italian cooking! My wife and I have been here several times and the food is fabulous; as close to home cooked Italian as it gets.  You must make reservations and the place is hard to find, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Wow. WOW! In this unassuming little strip mall in Westlake, OH- truly a gem. One of those meals we will not soon forget. The food is spectacular. The service is personal and exceptional (without being over the top.) Do call ahead- we almost missed out on this incredible meal because we didn't think we'd need a reservation on a Tuesday night. You WILL. We only got in by the kindness of Carmella (owner and chef). This meal will cost you a tad more (97.00 for two without dessert)- but it will be so much better than a meal you might pay 75.00 for...its worth it. Probably makes sense to order a bottle of wine (rather than by the glass). If the roasted beet salad is on the menu, get it (two can share). And I can't really resist linguini and white clams sauce, and I am thankful for that weakness tonight: one of the best renditions ever. This place is worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"A real gem.  Carmella the chef and owner is awesome in her attention to detail and creativity.  She works her magic from a scratch kitchen , everything is fresh and wonderous.  Wine selection is very nice.    Menu goes beyond traditional favorites in a authentic manner.    If you don't see something on the menu board that intrigues your taste buds, simply ask by saying 'please ' and if it can be done it will delight you.   We enjoyed the conversation with Carmella and staff after dinner as much as we enjoyed the great food   \"family\"  the old school way."}
{"text":"Went in and discovered a tiny little place with lots of stuff all over the place. Two older gentlemen and an older lady who all appeared to work there were in the back area mixing and drinking what looked to be Bloody Mary's. A younger woman led me to a table, took my drink order, waited on everyone else and finally was able to bring me the one menu in the whole place on a chalkboard. Some appetizers that didn't seem appetizing and the 10 pound board was then turned to display the entrees, all 7 of them and the only sauce options for pasta was marinara and Alfredo.  Really!  I took note of the large unorganized shelf unit blocking the kitchen area and the table full of unlabeled bottles of red something and papers everywhere and the staff all standing around with cocktails on their hands. Decided my best menu option was another restaurant. I left."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most amazing dining experience!  Great family owned place with the best meal I've ever had in my life. There is no menu, which is neat. Dont be in a rush. This is the kind of meal you need to slow down and enjoy. Its a small place so you might need to call ahead. We lucked out and walked in and got a table.  I can't say enough. Just down right fantastic!"}
{"text":"ok so I'm not one to write up reviews but i really felt inclined after experiencing this restaurant. this is the second time i have been here and i have to say this is THE BEST Italian place in ohio. i would've given it 5 stars if not for their odd decor but the food is to die for. the menu changes from day to day depending on what is fresh at the market it seems. i had their linguini and clams which is amazing and their buffalo chhese and stuffed jalepeno apps. delish!"}
{"text":"Went there because all the reviews for this place are great. Its is very small inside maybe 15 tables. The flood was great. Everything we ate was very fresh.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The best of Italy without the travel time. My husband and I enjoyed dinner there a week ago. The pasta with fresh asparagus in pesto sauce was so flavorful! I loved every bite! My husband had the rosemary pork loin - tender and tasty. My favorite salad dressing is the house made citrus hazelnut. It's not it be missed. For dessert we shared the chocolate-covered spumoni bombe. Ask for the amaretto liqueur for a special topping. Delicious!! Don't wait for a special occasion to visit, but if you do, this is the place.  Carmella and her family will love serving you. Support our local merchants."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. Everything I've had here is absolutely amazing. I'm no stranger to authentic italian food, i do thonk thos is the best you can get without going to italy itself. It's definitely not a place to go if you want a quick in and out, you have to plan to spend some time here. Make sure you call ahead to ensure they are not having a private party. We held my grandma's 90th birthday party here and they closed down the restaurant to host us, about 35 people. They were very easy to work with and everyone had a fabulous time."}
{"text":"Fantastic little dive for great food as authentic as it gets in the US.  People are great and it feels very family oriented, with lots of regulars.  Make sure to call ahead, with limited seating you'll want to set reservations."}
