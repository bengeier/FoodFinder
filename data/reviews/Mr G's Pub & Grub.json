{"text":"This place is literally a max and relax place. Whether it's the food, beer, or pool, you'll definitely enjoy your stay at Mr. G's. Plus, their happy hour runs from 12-4 am so this is the perfect place for a pint if your drinking around that time."}
{"text":"Very good food & always excellent service in both the restaurant side & the bar side..very close to where I live which is another bonus!"}
{"text":"Mr G's Pub & Grub is an excellent location where they treat the customers very well and go out of there way to make you feel welcome. I spend some time there and met some very friendly people while I had a few beers. I will be visiting this local bar & grill again in the future. You won't be disappointed by visiting this local bar in an excellent location on the east side of town."}
{"text":"Ron, Ron is the man.. we went across the street and got kicked out!:(
This place was very warm and welcoming!!!"}
{"text":"Just moved close by also and wanted to try Mr. Gs,  food. Straight up terrible service. Wings were good but took forever to come out and on the bar side the bartender was to busy smoking and socializing to even ask for anything. They had a server who was doubling as the delivery driver so she was not even really there and not to mention everything was watered down like the ranch and hot sauce. Junk junk junk. A visit from Bar rescue wouldn't even help..."}
{"text":"Do you like cheap drinks and friendly people?  Of course you do!  This place has both of these things as well as some delicious greasy bar food.  Live a little."}
{"text":"Used Mr G's as a rally point prior to carb up prior to heading to complete the remainder of the River Mountain Loop Trail.  I met up with Zac M. at the bar.  The bartender Ron was about as friendly as a bartender can be.  Granted we were the only ones inside the joint on a Sunday at 8:00 in the morning.  

I have been inside the particular suite under different names several times of the past decade.  Under the name of Mr. G's, it's the cleanest and most pleasant smelling I have ever experienced.  There was no smokey smell.  There was also no stall smell of a spilt beer or any other alcoholic beverage for that matter.  This includes the bathroom of which I also found unusually clean for such an establishment.

Ron was on point with coffee and beer.  We were carb loading after all. I thought the beer selection was slightly limited for my wanna-be liquid bread palate.  Ron was full of stories about the pub and tales of old Vegas.

Reggie our cook tucked away in the back somewhere was as affable as Ron.  He produced a simply glorious breakfast for Zack M and myself.  I had a breakfast quesadilla which was hearty and absolutely helped propel for my adventure to come.

MGP&G has a great staff, great food, good & cold beer, gaming, pool tables, and a safe environment."}
{"text":"Very good experience here. We live close by but never before had checked it out. Had heard good things about the food and decided on a test run. I tried a simple cheese pizza; it was excellent, a huge step up from what you get at a place like Dominos or Pizza Hut (not to disparage these two in particular). My wife had a simple BLT and it too was better than just good. The accompanying fries were excellent (I ate half of hers!) 

Service was excellent, and prices very reasonable. More than reasonable for my draft beer. $2 for a 16 oz. beer?  When was the last time I saw that, outside of some special during an NFL game in a casino sports book? Long ago! 

Yes, this place is a hidden gem. I just hope it stays in business. The shelf life of places that serve decent pub grub at these kind of prices, in Las Vegas, is woefully brief."}
{"text":"It's a dive bar, with a kitchen, with very limited smokiness. Unclear whether smoking is disallowed indoors, or if they just have a great ventilation system. They also have pool tables, and booths for dine-in seating. Staff was polite, service was perfunctory, prices were cheap, built-in gaming at the bar."}
{"text":"I went in on a Sunday night and it was empty which immensely improved the service. This time we had two people serving us and they were pretty friendly. Their parmesan garlic wing were great and the johnny vegas fries were calorific. I will be back again and hope I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My sister, me, and my fiance went here tonight, and it was my sister's second visit, and mine and my fiance' s third visit, and we've never been so put out and disgusted in our lives. First the so called bartende took forever to come over and take our drink order, then she had an attitude,  then we told her that we wanted to place a food order, and she didn't let the kitchen know jack about us. She took my sister's driver's license and was supposed to get her a Mr. G's card like I had, but she took forever on a slow ass night to return my sister's driver's license and then proceeded to give her the bullshit excuse that she had problems with her license,  and they were out of cards, so it took almost an hour, on a slow night to tell anyone that? Bullshit! She then supposedly had the manager's wife hand my fiance his soda, and that was bull, because she was getting sloshed at the bar with the other customers,  some manager's wife. The later we were told that there was no water in the restrooms ( major health code violation) which nothing was posted about, and then my sister was told that she had to have a certain drink limit before they could charge her card, and nowhere was this posted, so yet another violation. The only pleasant experience was our server and the food, which both were great, but the so call bar and bartender on Monday-Wednesday nights needs a overhaul. I recommend people come on Thursday-Sunday nights when the bartender Stevie is working. This night was a total let down, and we were so excited about going here again."}
{"text":"I love Mr. G's! the prices are right, the food is good, it has a nice atmosphere, and the bartenders are awesome! (Wanda and Garth especially) Check it out when you're on the eastside--you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Frindly neighborhood bar. Bartenders are always pleasant and accommodating. We like to chill here on quieter weekdays, but a busy Friday night is just as nice."}
{"text":"Wanda is absolutely amazing! I come here all the time and never leave disappointed. Not only do they have amazing bartenders but the food is outstanding!"}
{"text":"More from my exploration of the new neighborhood.
This place is great, food, cold beer bartender Stevie and chef Josh. Can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"The wings are delicious, the drinks are priced right and the staff is friendly and fun. Not to mention there are plenty of places to sit. If you don't want to sit at the bar you can opt for a comfy booth. Garth is the greatest."}
{"text":"Super relaxing atmosphere, staff is so nice and polite. The food is the best I've ever had at a bar, juicy burgers and the best Mac n cheese bites! Def coming back again"}
{"text":"Went here to play some video poker and have a few drinks. I asked to sign up for a player card so I could earn points for my play. I hand my drivers license to the older bartender and he takes a quick look at my ID. To my amazement he literally throws the I'd back at me and says \" no out of state ID's\" . I've signed up for a player card at numerous pubs in the area without issue. I told him without a player card I'd just leave and he would lose my business. He didn't seem to care.

I left with my $500.00 bankroll. Great way to run a business pal. No wonder it was empty."}
{"text":"Mr G's Pub and Grub is the quintessential neighborhood gaming bar with above average food. As soon as you walk in you experience a friendly greeting and sense of community. The patrons are locals who welcome you as family. There are 15 machines for you to try to buck the odds and leave with more cash than you walked in with. There were only a couple to chose from when I arrived. The beer is cold and atmosphere positive.

There are comfortable bar stools and booths if you so desire. The 70's decor bleeds through the modern decoration. Several flat screen tv's are positioned so that wherever you sit you can watch what interests you. There are two Diamond pool tables positioned with plenty of room to operate and not far from the bar which keeps it intimate. 

The attentive bartenders keep the libations fresh and full as time is quickly consumed by great conversation of various bar topics. Politics, sports, or recent events, you will leave with more information than you came in with.

The bathrooms are some of the cleanest I've experienced compared to other bars located through this particular band of town. 

There are two smoke eaters that attempt to keep the nicotine at bay however there needs to be a third. I do not smoke and would find it more pleasurable if there was one more to consume the perpetual cloud of smoke. Nonetheless the ventilation provides tolerable air quality. 

Overall this bar is an unexpected gem and pleasant surprise in this area. I have made it one of my top 5 watering holes as a result of many positive experiences I've had through multiple visits. If you want a positive, old school bar experience, swing by. I've always felt comfortable and welcome every time  I've walked through the door."}
{"text":"Smells like a mold & ashtray combo, the grave bartender is slow and the mood is boring. I live close and wanted to check the place out when it opened a couple months ago. First & last time here. One thing that was nice were the bathrooms,very nice touch on the blackout bathrooms & also smells better than the bar. If the rest of the bar was that same color and smelled just as good, you would have yourself a fine establishment. Wouldn't take much."}
{"text":"The bartender Wanda, ( the Greek goddess she is), is so personable, she makes it a point to get to know you, she is great at remembering who you are and she treats you like people, not just a customer, the restaurant attached, Johnny Vegas Grill, is great, best bar food, the wait staff is courtious and hard working, i personaly haven't had a bad meal there yet, the bar promos are good and every one treats you like a friend, i recomend Mr. G's to anyone looking for a bit of fun and good food"}
{"text":"Great servers and amazing food!! If you have not tried the Pizza Quesadilla you have not tried everything!!! Food prices are really good and you can play some pool if you even want!! I swear this was a hidden gem! Lived around the corner for 7 years and just found it!!!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this bar! If course you have negatives everywhere you go and you need to ignore that element, but the place is great to go to, food is good, pool tables quick! Come down and check it out....great weekend hangout!"}
{"text":"Love the bar tenders and the machines are always pooping live this place and wanda has to all night Stevie all day"}
{"text":"Wow hole in the wall spot but damn the food here is amazing !!! An Stevie was a doll !!!"}
{"text":"I ordered some late munchies for my wife and I from the JVG (Johnny Vegas Grill) and the food was excellent, but that's for a different review. After picking up my food I decided to stop by the bar. The bartender (who's name I don't know because he never said anything) was busy helping a guy that just walked in. After making his drinks and speaking to the other two guests he sits down and continues his conversation. 

10 minutes and 40 bucks later, no drink, no approach, no service. And that's the extent of my review because I can't even describe anything of substance. In fact the guy was rude to the one guy he was talking to. Oh well never again."}
{"text":"First time food was ok, we were out shop. ping and stopped to try it out not close enough to home to stop again"}
{"text":"Went here several times, gave it many chances. Every time it's something different! I pay, I tip and the bar tender Wanda likes to talk junk about me a paying customer and (I'm a married man with a child) calls me GAY because I have stopped in after work with an old guy friend. Terrible customer service, from WANDA! Old Vegas Tavern is right across the street, save yourself the drama and low life bar tender has and the complaining about how miserable her life is and how she doesn't have money and her car is always being repaired etc. time to grow up Wanda, get a clue! Customer Service RUNS THIS TOWN!! 
Never Again!"}
