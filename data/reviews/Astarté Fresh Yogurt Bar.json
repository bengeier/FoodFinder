{"text":"Cute little place down by the PATH near St Andrew station. I always get their strawberry peanut butter yogurt and maple walnut yogurt. At first I was thinking their prices is a bit pricey and the flavors they have sounds like something I can make at home but when I saw how much they put in that little container I think it's worth it. 

I would recommend their strawberry peanut butter since it is very filling for the price you paid."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place. Maybe that's because of my love of greek yogurt. Toronto needs more greek yogurt places! I don't think it's that pricey - their greek yogurt is very thick and filling."}
{"text":"I never was a fan of greek yogurt until I tasted what this store has to offer.
Just one try and I've been a constant buyer ever since. I've tried pretty much everything in their menu and my favorite by far are blueberry and lavender and their special valentine's feature (which they still serve as of today), raspberry and chocolate. This surely is a great way to give yourself a head start on your daily dosage of \"healthy yet oh so yummy\". If you're the kind to skip lunch at times due to a hectic day, this will surely keep you full until then. Try their oatmeal cookie too. It's delicious! :)"}
{"text":"My breakfast spot on the way to work. Be sure to try the blueberry yogurt bowl or the honey walnut. This is a unique concept which they do extremely well. Lots of organic and gluten free options on their menu."}
{"text":"so so good!!!  I've been treating myself to Astarte for breakfast once a week for about 4 months (would love to go more often but it's too expensive for my pockets)... 
I'm IN LOVE with their maple pumpkin and their lemon poppy seed (listed under their seasonal items, but it's been there for a while and I'm sure glad for that!)  
They are generous with the granola and the fruit toppings which is great, I never have to eat a bite of the yogurt without enough yummy stuff on top.
I finally decided to buy a jar of their maple pumpkin preserve (they sell toppings and granola separatley too) and I now make it at home on the weekends... it's not quite the same since I use different yogurt and granola, but it's better than nothing....
Also, as anotehr reviewr said, she's right, I feel like I can turn the bowl upside down and it wouldn't fall out, it's THAT thick and rich!
If this was priced a little cheaper, I would get this every day :)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I don't like yogurt.  I'll buy it because I'm trying to be healthy but will eat it begrudgingly, not really enjoying myself.

That said, I absolutely love Astarte yogurt!!!  It's fresh, creamy, nutritious and filling.  I admit, the price is a bit steep but it's a nice weekly treat for breakfast or snack.  I've had it for breakfast a couple of times and it kept me satiated all morning.  

If you're not able to stop in the PATH to check them out, Astarte yogurt is also sold at Jimmy's coffee (I've seen them at both the Gerrard and Portland locations).

My favourite flavour so far is pb & j!"}
{"text":"Oh My Glob, after only one small Strawberry & Peanut Butter yogurt, I feel full to the almost-upchucking point.  Deceivingly filling for such a small container!  Greek yogurt is much heavier and denser than the \"regular\" type, I suppose, and coupled with the 3 tablespoons or so of peanut butter adds to it too.  All yogurt parfaits are also served with granola. 

The tart yogurt is so dense, I'm tempted to turn it upside down, Dairy Queen-style.   If I dumped this in my lap by accident, I would probably have the most well-moisturized lap in the world - it would make such an awesome facial mask!  

It would be a very pricey mask though, after taxes running up to $6 for a small cup.  That's pretty much my only gripe."}
{"text":"Tasty Greek yoghurt with great quality ingredients but $4.87 for a small is expensive for what you get. The menu was very confusing at the start and it wasn't very clear to passers-by what they actually served. This was recently fixed and there is now a large board with clear prices on the wall behind the counter.

I would consider Astarte for breakfast as a treat, in my opinion it's too expensive to go there regularly, regardless of the quality of the ingredients."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Very cute storefront, friendly staff and healthy, delicious yogurt!"}
{"text":"This would be something I'd fall for. Healthy-check. 0% Yogurt-Check. In the PATH-Check. Cute kiosk-check. Price--this is where I break my habit before it even \"astarts.\"

You can choose a variety of sizes from the following options of bowls:

Honey & Walnut, Maple Syrup & Pecan, Lemon & Poppy Seed, Peanut Butter & Strawberry, Cucumber, Blueberry & Lavender, and Orange-Raspberry Almond.

I had the small Lemon and poppy seed bowl, and it was everything I thought it would be! Creamy, delicious and a sure-assassin for that 3 o'clock sugar slump; however, I'm going to conclude that it is not worth the $6+ price tag. I'd rather just go by Longos (located two steps away) and buy a whole tub of Greek yogurt for relatively the same price. 

Cute idea, but surprisingly, not something I would indulge in over and over again."}
{"text":"I had the blueberry lavender and it's ooohhhh so amazing!! In fact, I do feel like it's a gem of a yoghurt place. It's simple, not extremely heavy but so filling. There's not a ton of great yoghurt places around and the people who work here are super friendly. I can imagine insane lineups if this was situated more where people can find it easier. 

Ditch the ice cream/cake! Eat a healthier option!"}
{"text":"I would give them a 3.5, I really wanted them to be amazing but I was pretty under-whelmed! I got the blueberry lavender Greek yogurt. Came to around 5.00 for a small. They top them with granola. They don't have a huge variety of choices but it is a small shop so that's understandable. The staff was nice enough and efficient.
I just felt like it wasn't anything special, I could make the same thing at home or buy it from the grocery store for half the price. I was expecting the toppings to be exceptional. They did put a generous amount though so that is good.
I doubt I will be back, it's just too expensive for what you're getting."}
{"text":"If you've ever been down in the Path on any given day, you'll hardly see anybody for longer than 10 seconds as everybody is in a rush for something.  With everyone's busy lives and grab and go atmosphere, Astarté comes to the rescue for everyone who forgets, doesn't have a chance to, or have enough time for breakfast.

Astarté is a little fresh yogurt shop that has a small menu, but packs a big punch in terms of how much you get.  I really couldn't believe how much I got (I was kinda expecting a yogurt cup like you get at the grocery store).  The cup is filled with greek yogurt and toppings.

I got the blueberry and lavender yogurt and was pleasantly surprised.  Do you know the feeling when there isn't enough topping for the stuff that's underneath?  Well there isn't any of that.  There's a nice amount of topping to ensure every single bite of yogurt gets paired.

What I was really surprised about was how fast it was to get something.  Astarté has their sh*t down!  But I guess you kinda have to if you're going to be trying to stop formula 1 cars (ie. people) on the way to their busy meetings (or in most cases, just from being late)."}
{"text":"Amazing, as good Greek yogurt as I've had in Greece. Peanut butter and strawberry is my favourite so far, I didn't like the blueberry lavender. I would have it plain it was so good."}
{"text":"After eating breakfast here almost every morning for the past two months I thought I should write a review.  This place has done such a fantastic job of creating a Greek yogurt bowl.  The yogurt is way better than anything you can find in a grocery store and the granola / fruit toppings are sooo good.  Honestly I crave the Maple Pecan every morning!!"}
{"text":"Ok I get it, you want to project a hip and trendy image with the Greek yougurt bandwagon, but man! put some clothes on and cover your body hair.  Nobody wants to have a piece of armpit hair in their yougurt.  Yup, armpit hair.  Spotted male employee wearing a tank top - not the workout kind, but the one men may wear under their shirts - your 'wife-beater' type, while preparing yougurt for the morning rush.  Filthy disgusting!

Listen, you can still look trendy and hip while wearing clothes that covers your upper arms.  Also keep in mind that this establishment runs out off the PATH, a corporate environment where business attire runs from 9-5, you stick out like a filty slob who just roll out of bed.  I have passed by most food courts in the PATH network, and never have I seen front of the line staff wearing beaters or other types of sleeveless.
