{"text":"Really happy with this service. Food fresh, delicious, healthy. Delivered in a timely fashion. Best deal I found and they will modify and work with you. I follow a zone diet and can be tricky. They do their best to try to adhere to caloric restrictions and can even tailor more for small additional costs.   I receive lunches and dinners 5 days per week and look forward to eating now because I know I won't be straying from my health plan."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, food is simple you can make every dish on your own without any effort. Did I mention terrible customer service. They don't understand how a calendar works and don't know how to pickup a phone or return a message. I won't totally bash them, the delivery service was good except the time they forgot to deliver my food."}
{"text":"Lifestyle has great tasting meals and wonderful customer service.  I like that they delivery several times through the week, so the meals are fresh.  Unlike some other places that ship meals across the country for the entire week.  I eat more vegetables when I order through Lean Lifestyle.  I just wish they had organic options."}
{"text":"I've been using Lean Lifestyle for about a month and so far I have been very impressed!  I order 5 lunches and 7 dinners, and my husband gets 5 dinners as well.  The deliveries are incredibly convenient and are always on time, packed with lots of ice, and we have never had any issues with not receiving items or a delivery.  From the start I was able to make adjustments to fit my specific needs and preferences like no dairy or starches, which are always labeled on my meal containers, and select the proteins and veggies I like best.  So far everything I have tried has been delicious and I personally highly recommend all the salads which are perfect for lunch, the curry is amazing, the chicken piccata is delicious, and the Cajun shrimp is very yummy and my husband can't get enough of the turkey burger!  This has made our lives so much easier and healthier and I have seen changes on the scale which makes the investment in our health totally worth it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I started this program a few weeks ago. Immediately we were impressed by the food. They have 3 different meal plans I am on the accelerated plan to lose weight and my husband is on the regular lifestyle plan (they also have a paleo plan for all you crossfit junkies). The first week was really hard, I was hungry!. The portion sizes  are what we should be eating not what we were eating before. Week by week it gets better and you are not so hungry. We both work long hours and did not want to have to think about what is for dinner or what are we going to take for lunch that is healthy. This takes all the stress out of eating healthy.The food is fresh and tastes really good. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to make life easier and healthier.  Kelli V"}
{"text":"I have been getting their food delivery service for a few months now. I am very happy with the service and the food is great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who either doesn't have the time to prep meals or just doesn't want the hassle."}
{"text":"I started with Lean Lifestyle less than a week ago, but after sampling just a handful of meals, I have upgraded my plan from \"lunch and dinner\" to \"breakfast, lunch and dinner\" and \"morning/afternoon/evening\" snacks - I am all in with them.  The food is sensational, and I don't say that easily. The ingredients are fresh and each element of the meal is well-seasoned. My only wish is that there was more of it, but that would defeat the purpose as I'm utilizing the service to aid in weight loss.  Their customer service has also been good as I made several adjustments from the start. And the convenience is off the charts.  I always said if I had a personal chef to cook all my meals for me, losing weight would be much easier. With this service, I've found just that. I highly recommend them!  (And to those who may complain about the cost, try adding up the cost of all the meals out, food delivery charges, groceries tossed because your best intentions to cook healthy weren't realized, etc. If this service helps me get healthy again, it's worth every dime and then some!)"}
{"text":"This is a good service in theory, but perhaps should be run a little different, or use a different company.  I called twice to the organization both times asking for a call back, and never receiving one. The second time I called, I specifically asked that they not only call back but that this was purchased by some of my office associates and that I would be fasting the week of August 4th and that I would like to start this service the following week.  I just got off the phone with customer service, first I was made to feel that I was lying about leaving a message, as the gentleman stated several times that he had no record of me calling. He did receive my first voicemail, some few days before but somehow the second voicemail never came through.   He then rather begrudgingly decided that they would do me a favor and cancel this week's meals, but I would not be credited for the two meals delivered in error that I cannot eat because I am fasting. Never once saying that he was sorry this happened, only that we can cancel and start next week minus the two meals you already received.  So while this service may seem like a good idea in theory, I would suggest you doing your homework and find another company that truly believes in \"customer service\", or maybe just answers their phone and returns calls. I work in customer service, and I would've never indicated by my tone or words that the customer is lying about leaving a voicemail, especially when I have record of previous contact by the customer within a few days. I also would of apologized to the customer that they didn't receive the proper attention they deserved. Lastly, I would've told the customer without a doubt I would make sure she received her order the week she wanted, and that the company would eat the two days due to the error. Is the company really losing that much in 2 days worth of food, that they would sacrifice word of mouth, or even just a customer being happy. I'm not sure how much 2 days of meals costs, but the service is $150 a week for meals, and the company just lost 4 additional weeks of meals from me. = $600  If you do decide to use this company, if you happen to have ANY issues at all, I would suggest calling every ten minutes til you speak with someone live, and get an email in writing stating any change to ensure that it is properly handled.   Signed,  Misty = saddened that my first experience in trying to better my life by being healthy is tainted by bad customer service."}
{"text":"I've been using the service for a few weeks and couldn't be happier. The customer service is quick and helpful and all the meals and fresh and delicious! Working a full time, hectic job it's hard for me to find time to prep healthy meals. It's so nice knowing I can relax during what little free time I have and not have to worry about grocery shopping and cooking!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I am getting lunch and dinner seven times per week. I have not had a bad meal yet. The food is healthy. I have eaten more healthy vegetables and fruit in the last couple of weeks than I typically do in three months. I'm all in for this new, easy and delicious way to eat. So convenient and better than anything else I have tried."}
{"text":"Great meals!  Healthy and fresh.  I love that there isn't a lot of plastic waste/packaging..in fact, this is why I choose them and haven't regretted it.  I look forward to lunch every day!"}
{"text":"The first week everything went smoothly. Second, everything went wrong. I didn't get my delivery Sunday due to Superbowl traffic. yes traffic was crazy but they knew it was happening. Deliveries should have been delivered earlier that day. it took me an extra 30 minutes to get home from Scottsdale that evening. The delivery still could have been made. Received no call or an email apologizing for the inconvenience. I figured they would resend the delivery that didn't happen. Phone the following morning. Got the run around was informed I would get a credit and the remainder of my meals. I did receive all my credits.  Instead I got no meals Friday night which including my Friday- Sunday meals.  I canceled the rest of my meals. I received a call regarding my meals and to schedule the pick up bags. the gentleman accused me of having more than what I was telling him. I had to inform him that one of the bags I never got since delivery was never made. Then he tells me someone must have stolen my meals. Great concept but company is not very organized and staff needs help with customer service."}
{"text":"Lean Lifestyle has definitely exceeded my expectations. My schedule means I am traveling once or twice a week making my meal planning near impossible. The flexibility of Lean Lifestyle lets me schedule all the meals I need each week no matter what my schedule is. I have my meals ready to go before I leave and they are there waiting for me the morning I get back. Finally keeping a healthy eating regime has improved my productivity and I still have the time and energy to work out. I have tried other similar companies/concepts and this has been by far the best food, quality service, and flexible company. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Efficient and easy. Meals and menus are constantly rotated and billing is a breeze. It makes things a lot easier when you've got a plan that caters to your needs. Owner is a cool dude too. Cheers."}
{"text":"Lean lifestyles is the best food preparation and delivery company I've found in Phoenix. I have my food delivered on Sunday nights and Tuesday nights. It's always kept cool and you can tell that the food is extremely fresh and the people that assemble the food take time and have pride in what they put in those clear plastic dishes. Whenever I want to change up my diet a little bit I email Steve and they always are able to get my account updated. It's so convenient to just grab my lunch and a snack and head to the office knowing that I'm not going to be working a long period of time without eating. With my busy lifestyle the service is essential! Plus when I'm eating the meals consistently are usually lose around 15 pounds. I went off the meal program for a couple months this summer while traveling a lot and gained those pounds right back even though I tried to eat healthy. This time around I'm doing the Paleo diet with lots of salads and every time I have one of the salads the dressing is just the right portion and delicious! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Pros - food is good. Portions seem in line with a healthy diet plan - eggs or maybe protein oatmeal for breakfast, salad or wrap for lunch, entree with meat, reasonable grain serving and veggies for dinner.  Fills me up and makes me feel better physically.  I didn't take their snacks along with but maybe eat one yogurt or protein bar a day. You can set it to skip a meal on the weekends so you can eat out with friends one or two nights a week.  You can pick and choose between ingredients.  Food mostly seems fresh and is mostly good tasting.  The answering service is good for helping change if you need to take days off for vacation.  The cost is about what I was spending on too much eating out because I just am doing to much to cook for myself and then buying groceries I never have time to cook, food going to waste.  So it is cost-effective.    Cons - Called answering service twice to leave message asking for better calorie information.  No response.  Sometimes some of the veggies lately have been a little low quality ... i.e., green beans stringy.  When I take a food off my initial choices, they don't stop bringing it... i.e., I reacted to their salsa so I took it off my list, but they still throw it in with the eggs.  My weight loss slowed which may be due to some other physical problems I have but it would be nice to know better calorie info and check on it with the food.  Like if I don't eat the fruit, how many calories is breakfast?  Etc.  Helpful to understand how it works calorie wise better so I can track if I am undereating when I don't eat all the meals and take no snacks on my own and that can also stall weight loss, etc.    Overall - this service is good enough that I am not cancelling but not so good that a great competitor couldn't steal my business.  But I'm not leaving because I'm hooked on getting the meals that are mostly pretty yummy, filling, and healthy -- I at least feel better even when my weight loss stalls, and I like I said there could be some reasons for that that are not the fault of the meals.  It's just that I am going to check in with my doctor so being able to give an account of what is and isn't in the meals (food allergies possible), etc., more info from them would've been helpful to answer my doctor's questions."}
{"text":"I've had the service for a couple months now and overall I'm pretty satisfied. The meals are good and keep me feeling full. It's reasonably priced, comparable to eating out/fast food daily. I get lunch and dinner mon-sat which really help when I'm working and late at night when I don't feel like preparing something for myself.  The only downside is sometimes I receive food items that are unchecked in my ingredient list. For example I'll get carrots in my dinner meal when I shouldn't receive carrots at all.  Overall I am still using lean lifestyle and plan to keep it so long as they keep making me yummy, healthy meals!"}
{"text":"I have been using Lean Lifestyle for about a month or more now and have been very impressed. I have never not received a delivery, it is always on time and all my orders have been correct. The food is incredibly fresh and delicious. There has only been a couple dishes I didn't really like but that is just personal preference. I order 5 lunches and dinners per week so can only speak for those meals. You can customize your menu for the weeks ahead and when i have unchecked ingredients that i didn't want anymore I have not received them again. It is slightly more than I was spending on groceries per week but I consider it equal as I don't eat out as much and am not throwing unused groceries out. The convenience factor alone is worth it to me, especially because I work 12 hr shifts and I don't have to spend my time cooking meals ahead of my shifts. It has made eating healthy incredibly easy! The salads especially are so delicious and filling! Customer service for me has been extremely prompt as well."}
{"text":"I had my doubts and almost canceled when I got my first meal but it was only because I just really like re-heated fish.  Everything else since I changed my plan online has been awesome.  The food really is fantastic.  I haven't gotten a meal I didn't destroy.  I work late and cooking for myself and my wife every night was killing me.  Not only are the meals healthy they are very high quality.  Great job guys!  I am ordering lunches now too!"}
{"text":"Food and service is wonderful.  I typically don't have time to make my meals.  So, this is an affordable way to get through the day.  I also, lost about 10 lbs. in the 1st month with them."}
{"text":"My first day of trying Lean Lifestyle, I was pretty happy. The food was fresh, delivered at the time they said it would be, and tasted fairly good. The dinners were TINY, but the breakfast and lunch were nice and filling. However, this company is NOT good at listening to your preferences. They offer a checklist where you can un-check ingredients that you do not want, and a menu where you can select which dishes you prefer from a small drop-down menu. However, many of the ingredients I un-checked (one of which I am allergic to) kept showing up in my food- even after I called the company and they put a special note on the labels for my food saying NOT to include those ingredients. Also, the website keeps automatically changing my choices from the drop-down menu, so I keep getting meals I did not ask for and do not want.   The customer service rep was a nice guy, and the food is really not that bad, but if you are paying nearly $200 a week for a service that is not doing what they say they will, I think it's time to cancel and seek another option."}
{"text":"Tasty simple meals at a great price, delivered to your door in two day increments.Custom portion options for weight gain or weight loss. I cant ask for a better way to manage a healthy diet."}
{"text":"I loved this meal delivery service.  The food was fresh and appetizing.  The owner was also very helpful in offering double portions of the dinners in order to meet the needs of my family. However, out of the blue, the owner calls and says because I am so far away, they have to drop me as a customer since there are no other customers in my area.  Really?  So now I am left with the task of trying to find a meal delivery service that covers my area.  First world problem, I know. If the amount the customer pays is not enough to cover delivery prices then the customer should not have been taken on to begin with.   Other than this, I was happy with the service.  My advice is not to begin their service unless you live close to them."}
{"text":"I am really happy with the service.  At first I didn't know I could pick the meals and only thought I could customize the ingredients.  Nope there is a section for \"my meals\" after customizing the ingredients.  The customer service has been responsive and accommodating.  I also really like that I can do a only a couple days a week or more.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I am very satisfied with the service I am receiving from this place. The food is amazing and the portions are very fulfilling! It's only my first week and I already feel healthier. I am on the accelerator plan and if anyone is looking to lose weight this is the plan to do. I recommend it. It can be a little pricey, but I was honestly spending more eating out."}
{"text":"Where to begin...   The food was decent - nothing to call home about considering you're just microwaving it.   Some was better than others.  The problem is customer service.  It appears to be a one man company, everytime I contacted them, it was the same person.   Sometimes he'd respond to my emails right away, sometimes it'd be a week later, sometimes no responses at all.   The first week I started with them, I got my meals but nothing else.  I personally felt it odd there was no instructions on reheating.  I emailed them and got the response of 'it's between 1-4 minutes'.  So I had to guess every time, and nothing is more annoying than biting into your food and finding it cold still... while breakfast was burned because you put it in for 90 seconds.   I then asked him for nutrition information for the meals that I was receiving, which aren't available.  Being a \"healthy\" company, this surprised me.  I wanted to know exactly how many calories, carbs, and so on each meal was.   They responded with 'Each meal is around 500 calories'.   That's not helpful.   Due to the customer service issues, I decided to end our service after 2 months."}
{"text":"The company makes many mistakes. I ended my deliveries do to so many mistakes on my orders in the short few months I used their program. Upon doing so they owed me a credit to my credit card for the unused meals I did not receive but prepaid for. After a few emails I have not received correspondence regarding the credit they owe me. I would never recommend using their program to anyone based on the customer service or lack of I should say, even if the food was great."}
{"text":"The pros.  You can pick your meals ahead of time.  So far deliveries have been near or on the time line given (which is a wide range of times).  The meals are tasty and filling.  I have been able to stay on course for my diet using the meals, and initially lost weight.  I feel better physically sticking to the food even when I don't lose weight.  Very convenient for a single person who doesn't want to waste food by buying so much healthy fresh food and trying to cook it for myself, saves time, and ends up the same cost as eating out a lot, plus you can customize it to leave out a meal or two on the weekend and still eat out with friends when you want to.  I called when going on vacation and they agreed to hold the meals and that communication went nicely.  The cons.  Poor customer communication.  I have asked for information about calories.  My weight loss stalled and it may be due to other factors, but I called twice for info and no response.  Some info about that would be helpful.  Other than that, it's pretty good overall.  I'm satisfied enough to stay for now with the company, because it is working for me overall and I think my weight loss stalled from dehydration, stress, and thyroid problems, not the food, but it would've been helpful to discuss the calories a little more.  The claim that all meals are about 350 is not helpful to me, because what if on given day the breakfast is 250 and the lunch 400 and the dinner is 350.  I often get my snacks myself like yogurt and bars and some days with no snacks -- I might be undereating some days which can also stall weight loss.  Or I might be accidentally combining 200 calorie snacks with meals that are going over 350 for that day.    Minor nit. Lately the green beans have been stringy.  Every once in the while the meals are not quite as good as usual, with little downers like that.  Also I took salsa off my list because I had a reaction to their salsa and they keep sending it.  Little things like that.  If they had returned my nutrition phone calls I would feel better.  If they hadn't helped me with my vacation I would've left them.  They remain on the line for me -- not good enough to rate them 5 stars, not bad enough to live, but fair to middling and the price is right, but still keeping my eyes open in case I hear of a competitor nearby who meets my needs."}
