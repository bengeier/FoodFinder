{"text":"100% f**k yeah. I find there are very few places like this in Calgary. Nothing overly special about decor or pizzazz, but the food is down home cooking, and the staff is friendly, funny and very prompt. While other \"family eateries\" lack the close knit atmosphere, Prime Time is simple and timeless. The food is bang - on every time. It's quick and the portions are great. Highly recommended for a casual dining experience. P.S...Debbie the waitress is hilarious."}
{"text":"Well, as I said in my first review - I was only cautiously optimistic about this place. Turns out, with good reason.  Have been back twice since my initial review, and the last time will be the last.  The spaghetti was almost inedible. The vegetables on the side of the ribs my husband ordered where boiled to the point they were falling apart.  My chicken breast was dry, sitting on top of a very limp (old) salad.  I give them a year. Tops. Too bad."}
{"text":"There have been some great pizza places in Ramsay, George's, Paul's then the Spillery, all of whom produced great pizza, so good in fact that many times when we entertained we'd just order pizza - all to rave reviews. You can imagine our hesitance to try Prime Time after Paul's and Spillery made such pies. I was even more skeptical when the person taking my phone order said it was \"even better\". Well, I can tell you we just ate a terrific pizza. We ordered the Chef's Mistake and it was as good if not better than the Spillery. My only mistake was I forgot to order extra cheese like I use to do but we'll definitely order again. The neighborhood still has great pizza."}
{"text":"I live in Ramsay, and pass by this place every day. My boyfriend and I decided to give it a try after work tonight.   We started with the Calamari, which was delicious! Just the right amount of breading, and lots of flavor, it was so tasty! Also cooked perfectly, which is often not the case.   I had the steak sandwich and he had the pasta, which were both very good. Nice big steak, thick cut fries, I was very happy with my choice! There was also a zucchini salad with sautéed onions on the side. I was impressed with the sautéed onions, they were obviously cooked with care, very sweet and added a lot to such a small part of the meal.  I think it's easy to overlook that and send out half-cooked onions. Silly, I know, but it was a nice touch.   The service was amazing. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive, and made sure we had full waters and everything was taken care of, even though she was quite busy.   I think whatever bad experiences people have had here in the past are just that, a thing of the past. I'm so happy that we have such a hidden gem just down the street. :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant has changed hands three times in as many years now and it's not that much of a shocker. Delivery comes fast and the servers are friendly and accommodating but this is not going to make up for barely mediocre food. I've given it quite a few chances because my boyfriend likes them and they are close to us. The fries are made from real potatoes and when they are cooked properly taste nice. Pastas and burgers are very greasy and bland in flavor. The fish dishes are usually extremely overcooked and despite saying the halibut was pan fried with olive oil and lemon, mine came with a light breading which did not help the meal. The gravy is different every time and on some occasions even has cumin, while on other occasions tastes like gravy mixed with Swiss chalet sauce. If I find a good dish I will edit my review so that it reflects all sides of possibilities."}
