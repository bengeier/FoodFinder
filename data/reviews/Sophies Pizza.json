{"text":"Sophie's is a neighbourhood pizza shop that delivers pizza with a Greek flare.  
This is the first pizza I ordered when I first moved here, and it arrived hot and fast.  
Now, I'm definitely a thin crust guy myself, and pretty picky when it comes to 'za, so I can't really rave about Sophie's, but at the time it hit the spot.  The crust is thick but still tasty, and they don't skimp on fresh toppings.  This is a heavy pizza - I think the box weighed about three pounds.  The tomato sauce has a distinctly Greek taste - almost like cinnamon in there? -  but at least they put enough sauce on the pizza.  
The prices aren't rock bottom, but I can assure you that they use decent toppings, so you are getting what you pay for."}
{"text":"By the time I got home from work, the Mister had made dinner, but I was jonesin' for pizza & it didn't take much convincing!  We wanted to try Sophie's since we live in the area & like to support local business.  

First off, the guy on the phone was very rude.  I ordered a large pizza and asked how many pieces of Baklava you get for the price listed on the website menu.  He said that they no longer had that deal.  I asked if they had Baklava - yes.  How many do you get for the set price?  \"We no longer have that deal\".  This went on for awhile.  When we had the order down, he asked for my name and I answered.  Silence.  \"HELLO?  WHAT IS YOUR NAME?\"  Woah.  I asked my husband what the service was like when he picked the pizza up and he said that the guy at the counter just ignored him and was talking to the two customers behind him the whole time.  Needless to say, there is room for friendliness improvement.

The pizza itself was decent.  I'm more of a healthy, thin crust kind of pizza gal & this was pretty deep dish style & greasy.  I'm not going to say it tasted bad because it was good, just not my style.  The sauce was really good - tangy and different.  It is super heavy - I could only eat 1.5 pieces.  The end of the crust is the best part - baked cheese stuck to chewy yuminess!  My husband really liked it - I think it's a pizza, grease, & beer kinda guy's dream.

All in all, for me it is only a 2 star experience, for a deep dish lover, I suspect that it would be more like a 4!"}
{"text":"And I'm hooked.  First ordered here on the recommendation of a co-worker.  I moved to Airdrie and was disappointed with the lack of good Pizza.  Generally for 2 people we will order 2 mediums taking advantage of a commonly run second pizza half off offer.  General order is the House Special and the Triple Meat.  The magic is in the crust, and the fresh toppings, and the points, and well....... everything.  Pick up is usually 15 - 20 minutes.  I usually pick up to collect the reward points.  If you have never ordered pizza from Sophie's and you are considering it DO IT!!!!!!!!!  

They also have a location in south Calgary."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza sold here!!  Thick, crunchy crust LOADED with top quality toppings!  Lots of yummy house pizzas & salads to try!"}
{"text":"Love this place everyone I introduce this place loves it too! Not a huge fan of the chicken wings they can improve on them, but the pizza is full of sauce cheese and whatever toppings you may like"}
{"text":"This restaurant may seem expensive at first glance, but it is worth every penny!  When I last ordered it was buy 1, get the 2nd one half price.  Once you've tasted the fresh toppings and the homemade crust you will be glad you ordered from here.  They have many interesting choices for toppings and the service is quick and friendly.  I'd definitely recommend it unless you want cheap, \"it will do\" pizza."}
{"text":"Over priced and under delivers!
- A 12 inch pizza was likely only 10 inch.
- It barely fed the two of us.
- Tasted okay (definitely nothing to brag about)
- At $25, this was definitely not worth the price!
- Won't be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"Sophie's pizza is more of a deep dish style. I ordered pepperoni and mushroom. Overall the pizza was fine but nothing special. Nothing really stood out for me except the sauce. It was slightly sweet and had a distinctive spice like nutmeg, or something I'd equate to baked sweets. Definitely not how I like my sauce to taste. The amount of toppings were adequate for the style. And the crust was fine too. 

I also thought it was expensive, $15.50 for a 10\" two topping pizza. 

I will not go back."}
{"text":"First time at Sophie's and I thought it was a top ten pizza...all time.  I'm not a health nut...if I'm eating pizza...it's time to sin...I'm not looking for light and fresh. 
If I lived in Calgary this would be a default place.

Regarding comments about pricey...I paid about $20 for a large Pizza that fed two adults and a teenager after an eleven kilometer hike in the Rocky Mountains (Johnston's Canyon ink pots).  We all were full...for $20!  Price complaints make no sense to me...that's great value."}
{"text":"Great place, best pizza in airdrie and great staff. It's also cool how you can collect points but just not sure how much you need to buy before you get a free pizza. :)"}
{"text":"Well that was amazing!!!! 
I am new in town and had never heard of this place before, husband wanted pizza and I was on the fence but not super into pizza bur I am glad he picked this place. I have 5 damn pieces! I loved the crust! there was a sprinkling of parmesean cheese that added a great crunch and saltiness to the crust. I NEVER eat the crust of pizza but this one was soon good. The pizza is not greasy and the sauce was very tasty. I had the Hawaiian which had a lot of ham and pineapple and my husband had the lotzza mozza and he said it was also amazing. The price was a bit more than other pizza places but it's SERIOUSLY worth the increase in price. These guys know how to make pizza and should be adequately compensated for it! 

I have to say that living in Calgary, I thought when I moved out to the Airdrie area I would be losing some of my favourite restaurants and the quality in this small city would never compare to the big city. I have been amazed at what this city has had to offer and I now a new pizza place! 

Having friends over on the weekend and I now know what we are going to be eating."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery at work on Main St. Had two larges between 4 people, had a couple slices left over. I dont remember the type of pizzas, but they werent greasy like pizza hut, more similar to BPs. Was about $50 for the two so its definately not cheap.

Delivery was quick"}
{"text":"We have ordered from Sophies on a few occasions, typically because it is close and because the men in our family like the heavy-meaty-greasiness of their typical pizza. The women, though, protest and we order from Sophies less and less. 

They used to accomodate my request to put the toppings (of my vegetarian pizza) on top of the cheese (instead of on the bottom, which for some bizarre reason so may pizza joints like to do). Last time, the man taking the order wouldn't do it...\"Too much time\". I am not sure what that means, but as far as I can tell there should be no great difference and the rudeness was uncalled for. If it was my business I would want to keep a customer. Toppings on the bottom (or bottomings) are ok with meat, but most vegetable toppings like spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, etc. leach out liquid when they cook, leaving a soggy mess of the crust, while they cook beautifully on top. Needless to say, if you are a veggie lover, the crust gets slimy and the cheese just slips off the top. Just gross.

So, if you are a fan of the deep dish, more-about-the-crust, rock-in-you-gut style pizza, go ahead. If you prefer a thinner, crispy crust with exceptional toppings proudly displayed on top...bypass this place."}
{"text":"Pizza is really good (Greek style).  Definitely look for the take out specials, as it's a much better value, and you can save the $5 delivery charge (that I wasn't informed of before my first delivery).  Appetizers are also very tasty - particularly the meatballs and the teriyaki ribs."}
{"text":"Good pizza, with a very nice crust.  Ordered a large triple meat and there was no shortage of toppings which is what I want from a pizza, but seriously...$35 for a \"large\" pizza and 2L of pop? The \"large\" is a 12\" diameter which at any other place I've ordered from in my life is called a medium!

Like I said, good pizza but so not worth the ultra premium price tag"}
{"text":"If you're from or have been to Saskatchewan, you may be familiar with Western and/or Houston Pizza - proper thick crust, tons of meat and cheese. Sophie's isn't quite the same as home, but it is a very close 2nd and one of the best pizza places in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Very Very good pizza little pricey , but as far as quality and taste goes Thumbs up. Store is very clean when you go in there. Get the \"Damn Good Pizza\" It's my fave."}
{"text":"On the weekend we ordered one large pizza of each Sophie's Special and the sweet chili chicken. I love both of these pizzas. They were hot, not greasy and very delicious."}
{"text":"Nice deep dish style pizza. They make a pizza that is similar to Speros (sp) pizza..
They are a bit pricy bit overall I would still go back."}
{"text":"Overpriced garbage. Know what a pizza supposed to taste like before you TRY to cook one"}
{"text":"MY SOPHIES CHOICE: leave and never come back 

$40 pizza -- Too expensive! I ordered some pizzas for my Dad's birthday. One of the 'classics' we always ordered was discontinued but I could still order it -- no problem they said over the phone. What they didn't say was that they separately charged me for every single topping. So when I showed up to get it my bill was close to $100 for 2 large pizzas and a medium ? Huh? My mistake was not giving them the pizza back and leaving. After a huge argument with the owner who basically insinuated that the entire incident was my mistake I left.... I now order thin crust organic pizza from a different place close by for $21 per pizza. THE END"}
{"text":"Great food - the crust, and more importantly, the sauce is amazing. Thick gooey chunks of goodness. Love the Mediterranean."}
{"text":"I tried a variety of their menu items between pizzas and desserts and everything tastes really good! Their sauce is the best I've tasted on a pizza, also they're pretty generous with toppings! All in all I'd totally recommend that place for anyone who's up for some nice a bit greasy pizza."}
{"text":"So good!!! We always order the Hawaiian pizza which is weird because we never get Hawaiian but it is really good here. It isn't greasy like other places and the cheese tastes real :p it is pretty pricey but every once in awhile when you just want a good satisfying pizza then this is the place. 
We order a medium (about 17.00) between the two of us and it's the perfect size."}
{"text":"After hearing my coworkers RAVE about this place, I know I needed to try this place out. Although there's a Sophie's Pizza in Calgary, the Airdrie location worked out better as I was already in the area for another appointment.

I called beforehand to order so that I would be able to pick up the pizzas right after my appointment. Unfortunately, they had a system issue and had lost my order. The woman who spoke to me was very apologetic and even offered an additional 15% off. I really appreciated that they owned up to their mistake and put an effort in making it up to me. Luckily, I only had to wait 15 mins or so.

I can totally see why my coworkers love this place. To describe it, it's like a better version of Chicago deep dish pizza. It's toppings were of good quality and everything was put together nicely. The crust was thick albeit still tasty. And although this pizza definitely wasn't a healthy choice, it wasn't drenched in a pool of grease/oil like most fast food pizza joints are usually known for. We ordered the Royale and the Beefed Up. Both were delicious, but I preferred the Beefed Up over the Royale.

Sophie's Pizza lands itself as a \"premium\" fast food pizza choice with its expensive price tag, but it's good to know that if you order a medium or large pizza, you can get the second one for 50% off. I'll definitely return, but it'll have to be spaced out."}
{"text":"This is a very good looking pizza place. I went in early afternoon, and it was pretty slow. Very clean, well organized, and friendly. It actually looked like they were fairly busy on delivery, just no walk in customers.

Decided to give the basic classic pepperoni a try, since a simple pie is often the best barometer of how good a pizza place can be, paid, and waited. They said 10 minutes, I think it was a little quicker.

The pizza itself was pretty heavy - a medium that weighs more than a large at most Pizza places, so that's a good sign, right?

Got home, and dug in - not going to lie, I'm pretty full, and my mouth was pretty impressed with the taste, except for one thing - I ordered a pepperoni pizza, and despite having a thick layer of pepperoni, and LOTS of awesome cheese, I can't remember tasting the pepperoni once

The sauce, while uncommonly good, masked the taste of the meat, which is what I was looking forward to the most.

For a good, filling, reasonably priced for what you get pizza, this place is amazing - but if you really want to savor the flavour of the toppings, you can find better."}
{"text":"Sophie's or spiros always feud about where to order in on pizza Fridays steady food just like spiros hmmmmmm wonder why ? :)   Still love the thin crust from pizza gaga , sorry guys."}
{"text":"Disgusting over priced !!wouldnt feed it to a dog !"}
{"text":"Tried a \"Damn Good\" pizza at Sophie's based on a local recommendation.  It was the worst pizza we've ever had.  Hardly any toppings - we counted 12 olive slices on an XL pizza and there was very little meat and cheese.  It was mostly crust and sauce, both of which were horrible, we were scraping the toppings off the crust rather than eating it, the box would probably have had more flavor.  The sauce was very spicy and not in a good way, even the 12 year-old in our group had heartburn into the next day, as we all did.  Horrible pizza."}
{"text":"Sophie's used to be our very favourite go to pizza joint in Airdrie until we found hair in our chicken wings and when we complained she told us to deal with it, it's the supplier not the restaurant. Will never ever recommend Sophie's to anyone"}
{"text":"Our family heard about Sophies through a friend of ours. Apparently, the owners of Sophies used to own Spiros pizza on 17th Ave SW. We used to go to Spiros all the time. Anyways, we decided to try it. We got a large Hawaiian pizza and another 'loaded' one. The only word we can use to describe them is delicious. We like the old style pizza with lots of cheese and a thicker crust. And they did not disappoint. It was wonderful. But be warned, this is not a 'sit down' place. There are some basic high top tables if you wanted to rush in for lunch, but it's not a family sit down dinner place. But if you want delivery or take out, then its perfect. I recommend you do the take out. The pizza was hot when we picked it up and the service was relatively fast. There was just a couple of people ahead of us. So for movie nite at our house, we are going to be ordering Sophies from now on. Saturdays just got better. Enjoy."}
