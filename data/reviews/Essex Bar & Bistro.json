{"text":"This place is amazing!! We had come one time before our visit last night, and the food is the best in Charlotte! On a special side note, we had just gotten engaged before visiting Essex for dinner. The staff was wonderful and so celebratory even offering a complimentary bottle of champagne. Thank you all for such a memorable night!"}
{"text":"nice shrimp and hot bread combination. The dessert is about right. Good place to come with friend."}
{"text":"This is a new and hip place in Uptown right on the corner of Trade and Tryon St next to the giant gold wheel sculpture is (aka the Grand Disk).   FOOD The menu is mostly Mediterranean cuisine served as small plates and they definitely where on the smaller side for the price paid. I had the calamari and margherita flat bread. She had one of the salads and she asked for chicken to be added on top. The food was decent- she liked her salad, but my calamari and flatbread was just ok. We shared the baked Alaska dessert (see picture) which looked cool and tasted decent, but for $9 should have been twice the size it was. A traditional basked Alaska where they do a flambe at the table, but NC laws restrict that so no fire show at your seat!   ATMOSPHERE It's a cool atmosphere inside and they have a nice patio. We were there on a Thursday night and they had a decent crowd, but it was way too hot to side outside. The inside isn't huge, but you want a booth by a window. We were seated at the long banquette where they are all tables for 2 in the bar section. It was ok, but now knowing the layout, my preference would be a booth with window. It's a great place for a date or girl's night.    SERVICE Our server was Enrique and he was excellent. My friend was 15 minutes late and he was very nice and we never felt rushed."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this restaurant! My mother, sister and I went here for lunch and the quality of the food and service was amazing. We had the brie and mushroom burger, Moroccan soup and salad.. all 3 were delicious! Our waiter was extremely friendly and attentive, we will definitely be going back the next time we are in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner this past weekend.  Manager was also a Sommelier and opened three bottles of wine for my wife and I to taste at the table and pair with our food.  All three were delicious.  We chose different wines and ordered by the glass the price was very reasonable.  Had the tuna, calamari, bang bang grouper and the flatbread pizza my kids didn't finish... Service was excellent - attentive and helpful.  All for $111.  Will definitely go back!    Yes the servings are smaller - if you aren't smart enough to expect that when you see an entree for $13 in a downtown urban restaurant then go to Applebees and get all the fries you can eat..."}
{"text":"The person who sat me didn't tell a waitress or the hostess that she sat me so I sat there for about 10 mins. But food was great."}
{"text":"Sanitation score of 86.5 and service was worse..........  There were good dishes like the potato gnocchi, dim sum, and the garlic naan was yummy. Our other dishes were average at best. But to get our food, when it wasn't our waitor bringing it, the staff would go to each table asking if they ordered it before they made their way to our table. So after a couple times I informed our waitor about it and his response was \"sounds like their problem\". On top of that, he didn't refill my water towards the later end of our meal. Overall, I would rather spend my money somewhere else because you are just paying for the atmosphere and location."}
{"text":"Please don't bother. When our food came out we realized we didn't have silverware and that my plate had old crusted food caked on to it. Big deal right? Well, the food was lukewarm and not flavorful at all. Red sauce with the meatballs tasted like it came from a store bought bottle. Stuffed mushrooms were hard. And potato gnocchi wasn't anything special. So, yea, food was sub-par. As we're eating our sup-par food our waiter comes over with two more plates of food ready to serve us, we didn't order anymore food. Big deal right? Well then he comes over and says the rest of our food will be right out. We didn't order anything else! Come on!!! So disappointed!! We only have two days in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I've tried their lunch and dinner menus here and everything I've had was delicious! I always recommend this place to my friends and take friends visiting Charlotte to here!"}
{"text":"Jelani rocked service and the food and drinks were spot on! Highly recommend the bang bang group. Great drinks and patio for dining."}
{"text":"Ordered the warm brussel sprouts caesar salad. The \"salad\" was saturated with too much asiago cheese salad dressing and there weren't any \"house-made croutons\" on the salad, as described on the menu.  Server was scarce during meal so no opportunity to discuss.  Salad sounded good on paper but had a strange taste and temperature. Definitely wouldn't order this again."}
{"text":"Not worth the price. I bought an appetizer falafal today for take out. End up with 5 small baby feed falafal with very small size hamus ( not a true hamus) too salty. Price I paid 12$. That freeky crap for the price I pay. Bullshit."}
{"text":"We stopped by to grab a drink at the bar and a quick bite.  The cocktails are fantastic, especially the Italian Old Fashioned.  The bartender was great, very attentive despite a busy bar.  We had the roasted beet salad, cheese and charcuterie plate, and the tuna poke tacos.   All three were outstanding.  It was a little too cool to sit outside but it looked like a great place to enjoy an evening outdoors. Very glad we stopped here and we will be back when we are in town again."}
{"text":"I ordered the warm Brussel sprout salad to go and it was incredible! Chicken was juicy and soft while the Brussel sprouts made me actually enjoy eating healthy(ish). The hostess who brought out my order was very polite and fast. Only rating 3/5 because they forgot to add the house made croutons and I couldn't request them after I realized because I had ordered it take out. Upsetting as with tip it was a $14 lunch salad but oh well- a good way to cut carbs right!"}
{"text":"I have been to Essex 8-10 times. It was my go to place uptown. Tonight, we had a very disappointing experience. It took 45-1 hour for our food to arrive. After thirty minutes, I told the manager... he brought out two of seven dishes. My second dish never came so I cancelled it or we would have been very late for our concert. The server was unapologetic and kept telling us how busy the kitchen was... that's not our problem. We made a reservation with the expectation they would serve us food... this experience will make me think twice about coming back anytime soon"}
{"text":"We were here on Monday October 10 before the Panthers game. The food was fantastic and unique and our waiter Patrick was friendly and very knowledgeable. The bar service however was atrocious!! They had 1 bartender to handle a Monday night football crowd. We waited over 25 minutes for the first drink and almost 30 for the second round. We barely got the second round before it was time for the check. We also realized halfway thru the game that we never got the shrimp dish that we ordered and I'm pretty sure we paid for it. There were 6 of us ordering multiple shared plates. The food was fantastic. This could be a great new place if they can figure out the bar and service!!"}
{"text":"We were overwhelmed by the menu - mostly because we wanted to try everything!  We ended up splitting 3 dishes - The Beef Sopecitos were very good, the Tuna Poke Tacos were okay (needed something), and the Coconut Curry Mussels were amazing!  By far the best I've had in Charlotte!  The mussels were good quality and the curry sauce had the perfect amount of heat.  They came with a little loaf of bread for dipping and we probably could have gone through another 2 or 3 loafs with the sauce easily.  On another note - I found the drink menu very disappointing for a place advertised as a cocktail bar.  My boyfriend and I both ordered tequila beverages - His was very sweet and my margarita tasted like straight sours.  All in all - I look forward to trying some other food options, but I would suggest sticking to beer or wine."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I met someone here for lunch this week and I'm back again for dinner.  The warm brussels sprout salad (add chicken) is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The Essex is a short walk for us and we tried it last night, for the first time, for a birthday dinner. We received a very nice, warm welcome as we arrived. Service was great... they seem to work like a well-oiled machine, despite being so new.  We both really liked the atmosphere. They have a pretty nice wine selection, and enough enticing menu choices that we had a tough time deciding. Yirleana was very helping answering questions that we had. We chose the Tuna Poke Tacos, the Beef Sopecitos, Korean BBQ Shrimp Tacos, and the Chorizo Stuffed Fried Olives.   The Tuna Poke Tacos and Beef Sopecitos were my favorites (fabulous!), but everything was also very good. I would have liked a crisp, rather than soft, taco texture for the Shrimp Tacos, but that's just a personal choice and I still really enjoyed them. Next time I will attempt to try something new, but the Tuna and Beef were so good that it may be a challenge not to order them again!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Essex but our visit fell flat. The hubby and I started with some cocktails. His Titos and tonic was fine but my Cosmo had too much lime juice. Our Kale and Apple Salad came out first and was fresh and tasty. We also had the Rock Shrimp dish which was like a scampy. The warm bread was great for dipping. The Kalbi Beef was cooked nicely but our portion size seemed on the smaller side than others and wasn't hot. For my entree I had the Scallops, they we perfect and had a great flavor combination. The hubby had the steak dish but asked for it without the sauce and it was served with it. Bummer. They \"cleaned it up\" as our server said and brought it back out. I'm pretty sure they just rinsed it off and replated it.   Although nice, our server was not very knowledgeable and service was slow. We sat on the patio but they were finishing up construction next door so it wasn't the best atmosphere that evening but has potential. Maybe I'll have to give it another try."}
{"text":"I had been waiting anxiously for this place to open ever since construction started. Walking by everyday it seemed like there was something big on the way. Since it has opened, I have visited for lunch and drinks. For lunch, flatbreads,  fish tacos, and the banh mi sandwich were ordered. Everyone was very satisfied and found each dish quite flavorful. I myself ordered a side Greek salad which came out as the largest \"side\" I've ever had. Fresh feta was a great touch. As far as drinks, they have an extensive wine list that I love - you can order 1/2 glasses of wine! Makes it great to explore or just have enough. Also, the cocktails are very tasty and all syrups and mixers are made in house. A major plus!! Be sure to order the ginger smash. Will definitely be back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"The food we ordered was great. My favorites were the Brussels sprout Caesar salad and the butter chicken. We also has really good service. It was pretty hard to hear the other people in my party at 7:30 p.m. on a Friday, so consider how intimate a meal you want before booking."}
{"text":"Deliciously diverse menu, hard to go wrong with anything.  Butter chicken is on point, but my fav is the Asian skirt steak -HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  One of if not my favorite spot in town right now"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a cool decor and the potential to be a great place to eat at, however my experience wasn't good at all. The food took over 45 mins to get out and was cold, the dessert took about 30 mins. I understand it's Mother's Day and a busy holiday but this restaurant had mediocre food and decent service. Will not be coming back here again. Safe to say it wasn't the 4 blocks walk I did to get here."}
{"text":"OMG - the shaved brussels sprout caesar salad - YUM!!!! I will be back for that. We tried a few small plates and thoroughly enjoyed them all. Jelani took great care of us and guided us to all the good stuff so we could enjoy parents night out. We'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"So disappointed! My husband and I visited Essex during a weekend stay in Charlotte based on a friend's recommendation and good Yelp reviews. However, we did not have a good experience. Between the 2 of us, we ordered 4 plates to share: the Essex dip trio, veal meatballs, tuna poke tacos, and churrasco. The first item to arrive was the meatballs, which were room temperature covered with COLD sauce.  We then received the remaining 3, almost all at once. The naan with the dip trio was good; however, all of the dips seemed store bought and were mediocre at best.  The hanger steak was extremely overcooked.  The tuna poke tacos were good, but not worth a return visit.  One star because our server (unfortunately, I do not recall her name) was gracious and attentive.  I did appreciate that management did not charge us for the cold plate.  We, however, will definitely not return."}
{"text":"I came in on a weekday night with 10 of my girlfriends for a Girl's Night Out. We had a pleasant dining experience, sitting at the tables directly in front of the bar, and had a waiter who handled our large party of ladies with discriminating palates fairly well. I actually fell in love with the lamb sliders and the sophisticated atmosphere, even though the restaurant is a bit loud. Several days later, I called and inquired about availability for space to book a party of 20+ ladies for a return visit in Dec. The lady who answered the phone, and responded to my questions was pleasant and friendly, and informed me that she would pass the message on to the appropriate person, and that they could call me back in 2-3 days with details. I told her that I was excited to hear back, as we really enjoyed the restaurant, and were looking forward to returning and bringing more of our girlfriends. Fast forward over a week later-guess what, no return call! Either the communications within the organization are lacking, or there is little regard for paying customers who are interested in returning, and bringing MORE customers in. Without the negative experience after my phone call, with no follow up, I would have given a top star rating."}
{"text":"NOTE: THIS IS A LUNCH REVIEW, NOT A DINNER REVIEW  Today, I went with a group of colleagues from work for a lunch celebration today. One colleague was celebrating his 20th work anniversary so it was a special lunch and we chose Essex for the occasion.   Disappointment 1: I happily announced this momentous reason we were out to lunch to our server and it went completely unacknowledged. Was disappointed given just a little, \"Hey, that's great! Congratulations!\" would help make the experience something special for our colleague. Minor nit but the sign of a good server vs a not so good server...I was a server in my college days (a good one I might add).   Disappointment 2: When I ordered the salmon I specifically asked for it to be rare or medium rare at the most as I don't like it dry. Although fairly flavorful, it was dry when I received it. I ate 2/3 of it anyway as we did not have time to wait for another one to be cooked and I was hungry. I would have eaten all of it if prepared properly because I love salmon but I got tired of how dry it was so left a good amount on my plate. I shared my disappointment with the server and asked if he specifically told the kitchen I wanted rare to medium rare to which he responded with a simple, \"yes\". He also advised that the lunch kitchen staff was the \"B-Team\" and dinners were better than lunches generally. To that I told him, \"if I were the manager I would like to know that a customer did not get their lunch prepared how they asked it to be prepared, so please let the manager know.\" As I see it, this is an opportunity to improve the restaurant, after all.  Disappointment 3: When we got the check, there was no consideration (discount) given for the inadequate food preparation, nor did a manager stop by the table to \"make it right\" by simply apologizing or even acknowledging the complaint. I asked the server if he informed the manager and he said he had. I picked up the tab for the entire group and was not personally affected by the fact that no discount was offered since it was a celebratory event paid for by my company, but nonetheless I felt this was a missed opportunity for management to recover and make this group or each person in the group want to return. I shared that with the server as well. His reaction was to simply look at me. There was no acknowledgement or response.   With each of these interchanges, I was very respectful and conversant not demanding or rude in any way. This was an all around failure from a customer service perspective from the server, to the kitchen, to the management.   I will say this though, the ambience was cool. :=/"}
{"text":"Overpriced, mediocre drinks, fine food. Service was incredibly slow (and it was like they were doing you a favor), and the place next to me at the bar didn't get cleaned for 30 minutes (still dirty when I left). If you're looking to eat at the bar alone on a business trip, go to Aria across the street."}
{"text":"Awesome new spot in Charlotte. Good food and good vibes. Trendy crowd so don't show up looking like you just came from a football tailgate. If that's what you want, this isn't the place."}
{"text":"Great service! Had the Brussel Sprout Caesar, very good. Also had the Shrimp Scampi w/ naan it was bland could've used more seasoning but it was very filling. Also had calamari very flavorful and crisp! Great view of city! Definitely a great date spot"}
{"text":"Really poor service. Ordered drinks. Took forever to get anything, then tried to charge us for a drink we never got. Waiter obviously not happy we didn't order food."}
{"text":"They ran out of most of the seafood choices. Got the beef carpaccio and the beet salad, which were OK. Had a good vibe."}
{"text":"Just came in for a draynk.  Today's draynk : \"Italian Old Fashion Price $11  Pros:  Interesting combination - Rye Whiskey, Amarena Cherry, Blood Orange Basil, Red Bell Pepper, Honey Syrup, Prosecco.   Cons: The after taste was a little strange. Not sure if it was the Rye Whiskey or the Prosecco or something else, but it was a little like medicine (sounds strange but feel like it could've used a pinch of salt or sumin'), however I got used to it about half way through.  Overall Thoughts There was definitely something to be desired for this drink. I honestly wouldn't recommend this drink based off my experience. However, I would be willing to try again with something different."}
{"text":"Went here for a small brunch before a wedding. Took 20 minutes to be asked what we wanted, were never asked if we wanted anything between that time and when we started eating. We even had to get up and request place settings because our food was brought without them.  The Mediterranean omelette was very bland, so much so my girlfriend ate less than half and said she'd  rather just wait to eat at the wedding reception 5 hours later.  Only reason for 2 stars instead of one is the Steak and Egg wasn't terrible, at least the meat wasn't over cooked and the egg was properly over easy."}
{"text":"PHENOMENAL! Front hostesses were very kind and friendly when we walked in. Place was not busy as we came early. My tequila sunrise and and fiancées manhattan took a little longer than I would have liked but that's a small bump. Ordered my daughter the 4 cheese flatbread. We all had some and loved it. My fiancées beef torta was so fresh and tender. His grandmothers French toast was filling soft sweet and had a nice crunch. My fried fish tacos were delicious. Not too fishy and the perfect flavor combos. We will be coming back whenever we visit Charlotte"}
{"text":"Some of the best butter chicken I have had in my life. Their menu is definitely heavy on the middle eastern cuisines and it is executed well. The atmosphere is amazing and the food prices and options make this a perfect spot. Their drink menu is exciting and really adds to the appeal."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and all the staffs recommendations were on point. Tuna poke tacos and the butter chicken we're our favorites."}
{"text":"The food is alright. I ordered the BBQ Korean Tacos and they are much smaller than you might imagine (one small/medium sized shrimp per taco). My guest ordered the short rib sandwhich and he said it was good but didn't outweigh the lack of service. The service was horrible. We waited forever for our food and to get refills on our waters. I Won't ever be coming back here."}
{"text":"Our friend took us to this place and have to say this is a must go. Excellent food from all cultures. Start with some brussel sprouts, then some butter chicken, the steak and and the short rib ravioli.. I absolutely loved the ravioli and the butter chicken. Felt the steak was a little bit more salty than needed, but no complaints all over. For dessert oreded the mousse and it literally melted in the mouth.  The service was top notch and the host was very knowledgeable on the dishes.. The ambience is amazing and so is the music. Definitely will return if in the area."}
{"text":"I have been debating since Saturday on this rating and came to the conclusion that my Essex experience was A-OK. Since I work next door, I was hoping to really really love this place. I think we will be back for drinks at the bar, but may pass on dining next time (for a bit atleast).  My husband and I came for dinner with another couple on Saturday after doing the 4th Ward Holiday Home Tour. Probably was around 8pm and we were seated immediately. The setup and decorations are so cute. I love the Edison light bulb look for lighting. I passed this former fountain space every day before Essex was built and am just shocked with what they were able to do with this corner space!  I have heard that the mixed drinks here were outstanding and I can not wait to go back to try some. However, after looking at the bottled wine prices, both couples decided to go with a bottle of wine. I appreciate restaurants that have retail prices for wine bottles! My husband and I decided on a Sangiovese, which was delish.  We started with the Mediterranean trio dip and the gnocchi. The dip was nicely presented. The hummus and babaganoush were just ok but the tomato dip was absolutely fantastic. The gnocchi was pretty good as well.....I am a slightly harsh critic of Italian dishes, as my large Italian family makes pasta from scratch. Thought the gnocchi held up to standards :). After these starters, we ordered the following: -Short rib ravioli - Pretty good. Nothing stellar. Weirdly enough, i liked the veggies in this dish better than the ravioli -Tuna tartar- Winner! I love tuna tartar and this one was super tasty. A bit spicy but the chips cut that spice some.  -Asian steak - Good flavor in the steak. The best part of this dish was the puree under the steak! Amazing flavors -Shrimp and grits - This was pretty good. I liked that their was also sausage in it. Grits were very creamy  While we had some decent food, here are some areas that changed this review from a 4/5 star to a 3: -Service- Basically non-existent. I am not a needy customer. However, our waiter forgot to put in our first two items. Thus, we waited about 45 minutes from when we got wine to when we got food. Normally, that would have been ok, but this girl was hangry major and it was just a dip we ordered! He thought we were perusing the menu and we thought he was just waiting for our food. Didn't really apologize for forgetting to put the food in. Once the food started coming out, it was steady and as expected for a tapas place. It was fairly bare minimum service.  -Noise level- I recognize they are trying to go for a hip restaurant vibe but it was so freaking loud in there that I couldn't hear across the table, much less beside me. Between the loud music and all the people, it was just insane. I'm totally great with that loud atmosphere vibe but this felt above and beyond the normal loudness. I know this sounds whiny to complain about but if I can't even hear you from right across from me, that's a problem. -Price to Value- Been to many tapas restaurants in this city and I thought that everything was priced a bit higher than others. I am totally great with paying higher prices, if I think it is worth the value. Unfortunately, I am not sure if the value matches the price.   Maybe my expectations were a bit higher. Regardless, I think this is a place in Uptown that everyone should check out cause I feel that, once some kinks are worked out, this place will shine."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the bar with girlfriends. GREAT service, GREAT drinks and GREAT food. Highly recommend the spicy tuna tartare."}
{"text":"amazing food service and location!!!!  great tapas and selection of drinks.  will definitely go again!  went on Valentine's day; was able to get a reservation beforehand. was seated almost instantly after we showed up."}
{"text":"The food here is so good! My favorite is the kale and apple salad! It's a must try. Calamari is good here too not super crispy. I also tried the lobster tacos which are good but do not taste like lobster. And if you're getting a drink try the Essex gingerberry!"}
{"text":"A brussel sprout salad?! YESSSSS. It was so good and unique. Full of flavor for something that only had a few ingredients. Their hummus and pita .. oh my goodness .. out of this world. Their outdoor area is a big perk too, right in the heart of the city. Prices are reasonable and service was great! Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Nice location, cute place, decent cocktails. The butter chicken wasn't as great as some of the reviews I was relying on when ordering. What I didn't know going to this place and the waitress told us when we sat down is that the meal portions are smaller because this place is a bar and bites kinda place. However, when We got our food it wasn't that small, it was a decent size meal. I rated it 3 because I expected way more based on the reviews I read, but it wasn't all that great, it was just ok. I guess it's the atmosphere and the location that people love here.."}
{"text":"Wandered into this place and was pleasantly surprised. The food was excellent and the bartender gave great recommendations. The curry mussels are a must and their wine list is good and not that expensive."}
{"text":"I've been to Essex twice in the last 7 days! once on a Friday night and once on a Sunday evening. both times the service was EXCELLENT! super fast, super good, and the servers are super friendly. My Friday night experience was cool. the place was packed and very energetic. my party was a little late and the hostess asked me if I wanted a drink while I waited. I thought that was so sweet. most restaurants are hounding you for the test of your party to show up.  I ordered the shawarma tacos or pita (can't remember the name). Super good, however the sauce was too spicy for me. If you like spice though, dig in. hubby ordered the butter chicken which he raved about (and got the following Sunday we went. lol). we didn't do dessert on our first visit, but got some last night. I had the golden apple (and so did 3 other people at my table). It was TO DIE FOR!! SO YUMMY!!!  I'm 7 months pregnant so I couldn't drink but everyone at our table got a drink and said they were good! we basically shut the place down on the Sunday evening we went...although we weren't rushed out. it was such a pleasant experience and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Two dishes served cold.  Upon the return of these dishes back to the table, by whom we assumed was a manager (never introduced), the food was warm, but still not hot.  The sauce was cold on the plate and the meat was cold again on the inside.  The short rib pizza was delicious, but scant amount of short rib on the pizza.  Ambiance was great.  Location was perfect.  IPA beer selection a nice touch.  Wine list available, as well as drink lists.  Food tasted good, but nothing to return for on another visit.  I liked our server, but getting a smile out of him was like pulling teeth.  Nice guy, but perhaps he was nervous.  He definitely was knowledgable about the dishes, but appeared to be in a hurry to all of us.  Our impression of food: pre-cooked tapas was microwaved for our enjoyment.  Sad, miserably!  We were recommended this place and we were all disappointed."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and had a great experience. Shawarma Pita was some of the best Shawarma I have ever had, and the service was excellent.  We will certainly return."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a midday meal during the game. Great location in the heart of charlotte on Trade and Tryon. Decided to skip the people watching on the patio and we sat at the bar. I like that they have 3 different mixed drinks on tap. The Jameson julip and Margarita were actually pretty darn good. My only wish was for better music. I swear nickelback was gonna be played next. They could've put the game sound on but oh well. Now for the food...  We had the Korean steak and eggs and the lamb burger with a Greek salad. Totally awesome and will definitely be coming back for more. Hopefully the service and food are just as good when they're busy as when they're not."}
{"text":"If you don't luck up with parking next to a free meter,  go to the auto park garage. 206 s. Church st. Essex will validate that parking!"}
{"text":"Ok. Run.  Run quickly.  Don't eat here.  Service ridiculous.  Food cold.  Worst experience.   Many choices in Charlotte.  Don't be fooled.  My wife and I are laughing how pathetic this place is.  Trust me.  You will hear  this at least 10 tines. \" sorry we are crowded or the kitchen is busy\"."}
{"text":"This place is becoming mine and my girlfriend's favorite restaurant. She went to the soft opening and we went 2 more times in two weeks. Our favorite is the coconut curry mussels. The flavor superb and we always get extra naan to dip in the sauce. The Kalbi Beef is another favorite. The beef on the puree with the kimchi and sweet glaze has a wonderful flavor. The kalbi beef slider is another must. They are small tender lamb and beef patties with hummus with so much flavor. The pan seared scallops is another must served over cauliflower puree with fried cauliflower and curry. The scallops were seared perfectly. We also ordered the butter chicken. This is a tomato sauce littered with great spices and the chicken was tender and juicy making it that much better. This place is great for large groups or small. It can be a bit loud in there but is has been very busy since it open and I expect it to stay that way being one of the few good places we like in Uptown."}
{"text":"If you like small and pretentious food this is for you. Food was below average, made to look nice but tasted average."}
{"text":"So it is really hard for me to rate Essex with a two due to the fact that the food ambiance there is so amazing. Mainly the two refers to the service. Last night my friends and I went in to dine and were sat by the hostess but waited over 15 minutes before we were served or ever greeted by our server. What makes it even worse is that I had to get up from my table, fine the hostess and inform her that we had not yet been greeted at all. A few minutes after letting the hostess know our server came to our table and began to serve us. I was honestly a little upset that it took me having to get up and say something to be served. I'm very curious how much longer we would've waited if I had not gotten up to say anything. So because of the service I am rating Essex a 2. My expectations were not fully met at all."}
{"text":"Get the appetizer trio (guacamole, Greek yogurt, pimento cheese). Great service and food."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time at Essex. I had pretty much no idea what I was getting into, only that the menu was vegetarian-friendly enough. We had a 6:30 reservation on a Saturday night.  The location is very cool in the middle of Uptown. The restaurant is covered in glass. The interior is quite dark and decorated in a typical upscale restaurant fashion.   We both ordered two plates. Our food came out so fast that it actually beat our drinks. I had the warm Brussels sprout Caesar salad and a flatbread. Both were absolutely delicious. The salad in particular blew my mind. Shaved Brussels ( I think steamed then broiled? Unclear how it is prepared) with a fantastically creamy dressing. And not a tiny portion! And, as expected, the flatbread was delicious.   We followed dinner with pumpkin cheesecake that was also great. Didn't QUITE have the crust-to-cheesecake ratio that I like, but I'm very picky about that so I'll let it slide.  This is a VERY busy spot. You definitely need a reservation. Your waiter may disappear for a bit (the space is larger than you might think) but other than a mistake on our bill, I don't really have complaints. Essex is a definitely an experience, so you should go for a special occasion (and make sure your wallet is ready for it, too)."}
{"text":"Kindly, I give Essex a 2 star rating - because I had eaten there 3 times and had EXCELLENT experiences. The Bang Bang Grouper is just like Bang Bang Shrimp at Bonefish, but BETTER. Then tonight I visited with a friend out of town, raved about it with my husband and left in complete disappointment. We will have to be dragged to go back. Let's dive right into my astounding experience - we ordered 2 appetizers, of which took an abnormally like time to receive...1 never came out and was still included on the bill. Excuse for the 2nd appetizer not being made was stated as \"the kitchen ran out of flatbread.\" Okay, I can understand the kitchen may run out of menu items, but why wait 20 minutes to tell us and not offer a replacement? Next came entrees - the Rib Eye, then Gnocchi. Then 10 minutes later the Buttered Chicken and Tuna Tartare still never arrived. My husband asked our waiter where the rest of the food was and he quickly asked back \"What did you get again?\". We spoke to the manager, he was prompt to bring out the Chicken, but offered it with the clock ticket to show the time it was submitted in the system. Tuner tartare finally came when we asked for the check. My review ends here. Goodluck to this restaurant surviving Charlotte much longer. This restaurant needs new management. Only visit if you want 1/2 your ordered food and have time to wait."}
{"text":"We went for restaurant week.  The food was fantastic and the service was the best we have had in a long time.  I had the kale apple salad which was yummy.  My husband had the Greek salad which was overdressed but very flavorful.  We shared 4 small plates.  We had the mushroom flat bread which was very good.  Also the butter chicken which was saucy and had lots of spice.  We also had the rock shrimp in garlic sauce which came with freshly made bread to soak up all the sauce. We also had the sopecitos which had amazing flavor.  It was way more food than we could eat and had plenty left for lunch the next day.  I'm planning to go back to try more of their items because it was very difficult to choose just 4."}
{"text":"Overall, not impressed. They missed the mark on true international cuisine and their idea of fusing different cuisines together just didn't seem to work.  I ordered a cocktail from their drink list and was immediately told that they might be out of that cocktail - that they had been out of it for a few days. There were no special ingredients in it... and I'm pretty sure to not bottled up, so not sure how they could just run out of a hand made cocktail entirely.  She ultimately came back and said, oh they have it today, but I found it to be a weird situation.  My friend ordered the Korean steamed bun... and the server said, \"oh that's no longer a steamed bun, it's going to be made in a slider roll, hope that's okay.\" Umm, that's not really okay.  The churrasca was okay... but the Alfredo sauce on the chewy, burnt potatoes didn't seem to pair well with the chimichurri sauce. The beef was also over cooked.  They brought out shrimp and grits, even though we ordered Korean bbq shrimp tacos. We sent that back.  At the end of the night, she ran my card on a different table's check. She was incredibly unapologetic for everything.   Overall, not a great experience that just left us feeling like we seriously overpaid for a average meal with subpar service."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic brunch/lunch here today. The service was great, never a half full glass of anything, and the food outstanding. Highly recommend this place for a slow start Sunday."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now.  Once with a large group for lunch and once for dinner for 2 people.  Both times the service was great.  For lunch I had the chicken Brussels sprout salad and I ate the whole thing.  For dinner we had the beef sopecitos, tuna tartar, and the chicken dim sum; all the dishes were very good."}
{"text":"The husband and I have now been here twice. We went the first time on his birthday where I had another couple meet us for dinner to celebrate. We recently had a LATE night dinner here after an Ugly Sweater Party where there where no Vegan/Vegetarian friendly dishes and I was starved. Since switching over to Vegan it's been hard to go out to enjoy dinner as a lot of restaurants in Charlotte aren't vegan friendly. I find joy in cooking and meal prepping but who doesn't want to go out once in a while. I personally due to this fact would just provide 2 stars since there are only like 2-3 options I could indulge with modifications from the menu. However my husband isn't Vegan and he highly recommends this place as he always enjoy his land and sea dishes so I averaged out the Stars to 4.  My husband FAV dishes so far  - Beef sliders  - Bang Bang Grouper  - Shrimp in Garlic and butter   Items I've had that were yummy  - Beet and Kale salad  - Vegetable Samosa   I'll say give them a try plus they are on OpenTable which we LIVE BY for reservations. The scenery here is also very Trendy and nice. There is plenty of seating and comfy booths which we opt for each visit. The bartenders make the Non-Alcoholic Ginger Beer from scratch and it's always yummy.  Parking is the interesting part, with the cold temps the parking that is validated by Essex is pretty far which at the lot next to Ink and Ivy which is about 2-3 blocks away. If your lucky which we were our LATE night visit you can get street parking on Tryon and walk to the entry."}
{"text":"Excellent small plates & great service uptown locale for foodies!  I tried the chorizo stuffed olives. They are incredible, salty and juicy! They come on Greek yogurt which is unusual but tasty. The staff did a fantastic job of showing us their wine list. I chose a white from New Zealand, nice price and good flavor.  I liked the Korean beef entree and the brussel sprout caesar salad. Then we had the sliders and slaw. I think the Korean beef was the best for price and flavor. The only drawback is the parking is nonexistent since it is uptown and I could not find the parking garage they validate for because I got lost.  Great service and cool decorations! I liked the fact they let me be seated early and hang out waiting for the rest of my group."}
{"text":"Had such a great experience here! Came here after a long day of work with a colleague and sat by the bar. Ordered the butter chicken and bang bang grouper and both were scrumptious. Ended on the creme brûlée which was velvety and divine. The best part was the genuinely friendly and entertaining bartender Julien. We enjoyed the meaningful conversation and felt welcomed and comfortable for the whole evening.   Will definitely be back and highly recommend to those looking for an eclectic menu and delightful experience."}
{"text":"This is my third experience at Essex and it's one of Charlotte's finest establishments. Ambiance, client experience, and authentic culinary ingredients .... distinguishes Essex. Each dish is thoughtfully created. Our favorite dishes include bang bang grouper, ceviche, butter chicken, falafel, shawarma and the best prime ribeye with seasonal vegetables. Chef is extremely talented and takes extreme pride in each ingredients. Flavors are enriched and your taste buds will be firing on all cylinders! Charlotte has finally stepped it up with Essex! Location is in center city, trade and tryon. Do yourself a favor and make reservations!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at Essex last weekend.  The service was wonderful and so was the ambience.  Essex has balanced an upbeat vibe with its music and art and an intimate vibe with lighting and beautiful accents.  The wine selection was great with a wide price point and our dinner was lovely.  While our waitress suggested two small plates each we were actually overwhelmed by the amount of food for the table when we did so.  The portion sizes were wonderful and we had plenty of food to take with us to enjoy again later.  The ravioli was incredible. Whatever you do... Order that.  The only thing I could even remotely complain about was the gnocci because it was really salty and a few of our party didn't enjoy it. Which could have just been a fluke.  Clearly Essex takes its food and dining experience very seriously and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is an interestingly themed modern twist on a British pub. The name is sort of a giveaway and so is the inspired menu. I am fairly certain they have a discus driven British bull dog wall art next to the bar, but some folks in my friend circle are not as sure on that part!! The menu has some definite British favorites for indian food. The butter chicken is excellent with a unique twist on Naan bread. The best way I can describe the bread is a ciabatta texture that tastes like Garlic Naan but is shaped like a long baguette. The coconut curry mussels are absolutely fantastic. Perfect blend of tangy spicy curry meets the mild sweetness of coconut with the  nice savory flavor of mussels. The Pablo crusted samosas are just the right level of spicy for even someone who enjoys mild indian flavors to savor. The drinks are pretty good, the Essex Smash is unique. I could do with a more bold bitters flavor, but that might make the drink too specific and probably closer to one deep toned Old Fashioned. Now here comes the reason I rank this place 4 stars. We were in a relatively large group of 15. However folks were ordering in waves and would have expected a reasonable cadence of order fulfillment, especially for drinks. The staff were super friendly and that helps. However, this place could have probably made about 400-500 bucks more from our table if they were more attentive to the drinks. I will be back for more of the mussels and butter chicken for sure!"}
{"text":"I came for the restaurant week deal, which included a soup or a salad, any two items off of their menu and a dessert. This is a tapas style restaurant, but I was pleasantly surprised by the portion size of the items. With the soup and dessert, I had enough leftover from my entrees for leftovers for the next day. The short rib ravioli was phenomenal! My only complaint is that service was quite slow and the servers seemed to be having some trouble figuring out which tables food was supposed to go to"}
{"text":"Wonderful place! The food is amazing try the butter chicken! April is a amazing server and very attentive!! Always love the vibe of this place!"}
{"text":"I was a bit underwhelmed with Essex. After hearing so many great reviews from friends, the bar was set quite high.   The bar is gorgeous with some of the most comfortable bar seats I've experienced to date. I imagine that the atmosphere is great on a busier night. They offer an outdoor patio which is easily accessible from the sidewalk. During my visit, they were under construction but seem to be making the best out of the situation.  I had the Gambas Al Ajillo. The shrimp seemed a bit over cooked and the broth needed a bit more salt. However, the garlic naan served on the side added much needed flavor. Underwhelming at most.   I also had the espresso cocktail. I like the idea that the cocktail menu changes often. The bartender recommended this cocktail. Underwhelmed yet again.   I plan to visit again and update my review. Hopefully, I will have a better experience."}
{"text":"This is a great spot! I love small plates! Hey have a great menu. I want to go back and try more dishes. The Essex Dip Trio and the Short Rib Ravioli were two of my favorites. We also got the Korean BBQ Shrimp Tacos and Jurasco which were good. The service was great as well and the food came out quickly. If I could give 4.5 stars I would."}
{"text":"Charlotte's equivalent of the pretty girl in high school who wears too much make-up because she's worried about looking cool.  I liked it, but it's purposeful bourgeois-iness it a bit off-putting to me.  One positive note from a service standpoint - I came here right after it opened and they screwed up our order.  I wasn't remotely perturbed by it, however, they gave us a shit-load of free food, anyway.  So, thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"Ham and cheese board is great if you're just wanting a snack and wine. Perfect place to catch up with a friend by the bar. Not too busy right after work. Lunch is always busy. The Brussels salad is great, the trio dip is great (the yogurt dip is bland) ... honestly the food is great all around. Try any salad with a protein the shrimp pairs well with any of them!"}
{"text":"Arrived late in town for a training meeting and was grateful that this place was open and the kitchen was still taking orders at 10pm!!!  Great service by our waitress had drinks and food at the table in short order. It was described as a \"small plates\" sort of place but really the small plates were as large as what you would see elsewhere. Which was also reflected in the price. Not a complaint but that should have been my first clue!   That said the butter chicken and fish and chips were very nice. The butter chicken was basically in the Indian genre - very tasty curried sauce. Not sure where the \"butter\" label comes from but don't let that throw you. And it came with a massive bread loaf that was delicious in its own but perfect for sopping up the sauce.   The stuffed mushrooms were a little bland. Generous portions and Cooked well enough but still needed SOMETHING. My Bulleit Bourbon was a generous pour. Thank you! And the selection of other spirits at the bar was well chosen. Might need further exploration....  I saw other things on the menu that I expect would be very good - including a Churrasco dish, a Short Rib Ravioli AND a warm Brussels Sprouts Caesar Salad. Good spot. Definitely check this place out if you're in downtown Charlotte!"}
{"text":"First let me say I've eaten here twice for lunch and LOVED IT. I took my husband here for dinner tonight and we left feeling less than excited about the service & food. We ordered drinks from the bar and an appetizer & 15 minutes later our appetizer appeared but still no drinks. We are then told that the dinner menu is tapas style & to order 2 entrees per person. We ordered Korean Shrimp BBQ tacos which I had at lunch and they were good, the Al Pastor tacos, Shmarma Pita & chicken salad. After waiting, we were told they were sold out of the Shmarma Pita. The tacos arrived and there were 3 tiny tiny not even taco sized items. They were basically two bites per taco and priced at $13-$15 per entree. At lunch, it's $11.95 for 3 tacos and a generous side Greek salad which is very filling. After spending almost $30 for 6 tiny tacos, I'm thinking we won't return for dinner. The chicken salad was a larger portion and very tasty. All in all, we spent $92 including tip for dinner & it definitely wasn't worth the money spent! There are plenty of better dining spots in downtown!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Atmosphere is great just bad acoustics and hard to hear at dinner. There is a terrific patio looking out on Trade and Tryon. Unfortunately the service isn't good and the bar staff is unprofessional."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and culture in Essex. It is very lively and happening, and is quite loud, so maybe not the best for an intimate, romantic setting. They have a lovely cockail menu, though it's always hard to justify spending $12.00 per drink.    I went for restaurant week. At most places, restaurant week isn't a great judge of quality or character (in my opinion), because either the menu is limited, or places are cooking in advance. I didn't feel that way about Essex. They had everything available on the menu and offered the option for TWO entrees. They did cut down on the appetizers and offered just a greek or kale salad for your starter. The menu is wide ranging, and delicious, with various seafood, meat and flatbread items. I went with a girlfriend and split things to try it all. We went with the short rib flatbread, the bang bang grouper, the shawarma pita, and the lamb sliders.  Of all, my favorite was the bang bang grouper. Our server told us it is one of their more popular menu items - it started as a special but has stayed on the menu due to popularity. It did not disappoint and had the perfect balance of sweet and spicy with fried batter. Yum! I also liked the braised short rib flatbread, though don't be mistaken - you don't get a ton of meat on there. It wasn't a crisp flatbread like I prefer, but the cheesiness and creaminess made up for it. The herb ricotta and caramelized onion puree was very good.   I wouldn't order the shawarma pita again - I found it to be VERY DRY and unappealing. I love tahini, but this pita was just not working. The lamb sliders were decent. What I liked about them was a charcoal taste that reminded you of cooking by the campfire. I would have liked them to be a little juicier though.  Overall, service was good, considering it was restaurant week and very busy. I wish it were a little quieter inside. It was difficult to have a conversation at our table. There's still much more I'd like to try on the menu if we ever return."}
{"text":"Good turned bad turned good again. I Made a 7:30 reservation at Essex for a birthday party for 16 people after the restaurant at merchant and trade accidentally double booked and cancelled our reservation.  I was grateful that they allowed me to make a reservation at Essex last minute as merchant and trade told us two days before the party.  When we arrived we had to wait almost an hour to be seated. We started dinner pretty frustrated due to the long wait. They do not valet parking so those who paid a cab to bring them here or paid to park nearby would be out of the cost if we relocate. Not to mention the venue is Uptown so the odds of us finding another place to accommodate us last minute nearby is slim.    They definitely redeemed themselves later. The food was good and they staff was very attentive once we were seated. The manager brought the table a dish for our trouble.  I recommend coming but prepared if you have a large party reservation, there may be a wait on a busy night."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! 4 of us shared the tuna poke tacos, tuna tar tar, bang bang grouper, Korean BBQ bao bun, butter chicken, and kalbi beef."}
{"text":"Ate here before going to see the Nutcracker and it was the perfect choice! The service was excellent, as was the food. Between two people we shared the Korean Short Ribs, Stuffed Mushrooms and cheese and charcuterie plate. It was the perfect date night!! Will definitely be going back and is my new go to place before shows at the theater."}
{"text":"Walked in to a hostess rolling silverware that completely ignored us. Not even eye contact.  Next staff member more than balanced out that eye contact aspect though, as upon seeing us walk in she froze like a deer in headlights and just.... stayed like that. Seriously, I gave it about two minutes just to see if she was gonna do anything and just a statue staring right at us. I've never seen anything like it. Am I bothering you? Did you forget the line? It's \"hi.\" Weird. Long removed from the situation, I feel like if I was still standing there, she would be also. I almost want to say fear.  Bartender did at the end join in and also stare at us and do nothing. Left and went somewhere else. Strangest thing I've seen in quite some time. Menu looked pretty good, so, it's too bad. Does, however, explain why they had only one table at peak brunch hours on a Saturday. Really uncomfortable, and again, just weird."}
{"text":"We ordered too much food, but it was so tasty!! Traveling for work and met a local colleague for a group dinner - we had three people and decided to split a few things. We started with the waiter's 3 suggestions - the brussel sprout caesar, butter chicken, korean bbq shrimp tacos - all were delicious! Second course we did the veal meatballs, shawarma pita, and fried cauliflower. I would have gone without the shawarma and cauliflower, but all other dishes were excellent and flavorful. I would definitely return to try the rest of the menu items!"}
{"text":"The folks at Essex price their drinks like a sailor auctioning his last bottle on a long voyage.  The \"manager\" explained that the pricing on the check was a \"mistake\" and asked us how much we wanted to pay!  Essex is assuming that all the bankers would simply sign a check and not look at the prices (or the arbitrary fluctuations in pricing!).   There are better spots in town."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner a few weeks ago. Quite frankly, was not impressed. The food was mediocre and overpriced for what it was. For example, their three meat flatbread had tiny bits of generic tasting meat on it, and the dough tasted store bought. Another dish - the calamari came out very soggy and there were more peppers than actual calamari on the plate. The only thing we actually liked were their shrimp and grits.  In addition, our waiter seemed like he was new - wasn't really knowledgeable about the food, not sure what some of the items on the menu were. And when the kitchen was taking over 25 minutes to send out our dessert - the waiter, basically, just avoided our table."}
{"text":"We ate here before a concert today. The food and atmosphere are both great! We ordered the Mediterranean Dip Trio, Bang Bang Grouper and Short Rib Sliders. The grouper and sliders were wonderful! YUMM!!! The hummus was our favorite of the three dips. Wish we could have just ordered that."}
{"text":"Went to dinner this past Saturday night to celebrate my sisters birthday.  After sitting for about 10 minutes, we were informed the bathrooms are now out of order due to a water issue and the restaurant would be closing soon (guests were being sat the entire time we were eating, still sitting people when we left).  They gave us an option to stay or leave.  We decided to stay considering it was 8-830 on a Saturday night and it would be impossible to get a reservation somewhere else, along with continuing to seat people. About 15-20 minutes later we were told they were no longer serving cocktails, only beer and wine.  We were confused why they were not serving cocktails especially because later we saw the table beside us receiving cocktails.  A few minutes later, we noticed the temperature in the restaurant got very hot. Looking around, people were fanning themselves with their menus. They shut the AC off.  At this point, we definitely felt annoyed with how our dinner experience was going but never once complained about it to our server. At this point, we were just hoping to finish up quickly and leave. As we asked for our checks, our server, Amber M, dropped them off in silence and didn't say anything, just placing them on the table.  After taking a look we were confused on why we were being charged a 20% service gratuity, there was only 4 of us at the table.  We asked the manager about the gratuity charge and he said she shouldn't have done that and he will have a talk with her.  With all of the inconveniences going on with the restaurant that night never once did a manager come up to our table to apologize or even apologize about the server trying to charge us a service gratuity.  The entire experience was awful and disappointing.  We have all worked in the food industry and we know things happen that you cannot control but this was absolutely ridiculous.  And I have never worked or been in a restaurant where the manager doesn't at least check in with tables or even walk around on the floor for that matter.  Food was okay, service was terrible."}
{"text":"Poor service!  First the beer we ordered was brought to the table unopened and it wasn't a screw top. So finally we tracked someone down since waitress  disappeared to get it open.  Then when we ordered round 2, with different waiter since she was off duty now we waited at least 15 min. Of course he disappeared too and finally came back with 1 out of 3 drinks.  Place wasn't busy. And never refilled water glasses. Honestly! Ridiculous!!!  Better get their act together if they want to stay open.  It will be long time for us to go back."}
{"text":"I had a friend visiting Charlotte for the first time so I took her on a tour of the Queen City. After covering a lot of tertitory,  we stopped in this cool little spot to have a bevvie. We had planned to sit out on the patio but it was too hot. They had a fan but did not have it turned on.   Another reason we decided to move inside is because after the hostess seated us, it took forever for a server to come out & when he finally did, he did not bring drink menus.   The bar had a good vibe & bartender was very friendly & helpful.  Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Ok I am willing to give this place a second chance, while the waitstaff was extremely nice, I wasn't overly impressed by the food or the presentation of the food. Furthermore, the fact that they don't serve dessert during lunch almost ruined it for me. I'll try them again for dinner perhaps."}
{"text":"Food was overpriced and mediocre. Bang bang grouper was soggy in some spots. Short rib ravioli tasted like canned beef stew. The shell of the taco pastor ripped immediately. Gin and tonic was so sweet, I'm not sure there was any gin in it. Won't be back. I just got home and I already feel nauseous. Ambience was nice."}
{"text":"I'd been here a few times for lunch and I was very pleased. Service was fast and for a corporate environment the food was well prepared and flavorful.  Now, for my first dinner visit the ambiance was nice and we were promptly led to our table.  The food was good but something was missing. The waitress didn't tell us anything about what we were ordering, what kind of meat and cheeses were on our charcuterie board, she brought food promptly to the table but was not very educated about what she was bringing out. A good waiter will guide you through the meal.. not just bring food out.. still 4 out of 5 for food quality."}
{"text":"Drew is the BEST!!! Love him and he will be missed. Best of Luck at Wake Forest may all your dreams come true! Also maybe Omaha..."}
{"text":"Wow. The food here is outstanding, but I have honestly never seen more horrible service in my entire life. They served us martinis in wine glasses. Couldn't find other Pieces of the menu. Didn't know what beers they had available on tap. Couldn't keep the water glasses full. Bathrooms didn't have functional water. It's really a shame because the food and selection was great, but everything else was a huge miss. As someone from out of town, I was really looking forward to trying this venue but I couldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times and have always enjoyed.  I have been here solo, with small groups and large groups.  I recommend coming with a group as this is a tapas style restaurant and the more people, the more options you can share with your group.  Everything was great that I had here but the standouts for me are the Tuna Poke tacos, the warm Brussel sprout Caesar salad, the Butter Chicken and the bang bang grouper.  The flatbread pizza is great too and they have local beer selections.  When the weather is nice, they have a great outdoor station section.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal, awesome location and a great atmosphere. I only gave it 4 stars because our waitress, April, was rude. She never greeted us or said hello- she just asked \"are you drinking from the bar tonight\" and seemed annoyed when we said no. We had never been so we asked about the menu and she was very condescending because we didn't know it was a la carte. She maybe exchanged 10 words with us all night. I know it's not the restaurant because we could see other servers being super nice and talkative. I will go back for the grub but I will ask not to be seated with her."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and I LOVE the location and the classic vibes radiating from this place. The inside was MUCH bigger than I expected, and I definitely want to sit in their patio next time I come (gorgeous views!). It's very dimly lit, and my family complained of not knowing what they were eating the whole time... a very romantic place for dates though! We ordered a total of 11 plates of food to share amongst 7 people and it was a pretty good amount to fill us up. We got the Kalbi Beef Tacos, Korean BBQ Shrimp Tacos, Bang Bang Grouper, Shrimp and Grits, Butter Chicken, Potato Gnocchi, Stuffed Mushrooms(although we ordered a mushroom flatbread but it's all good), and the Essex Dip Trio.   It was good! I'm not WOWED, everything tasted great but nothing like pushed passed the IMPRESSIVE point. The tapas are pretty expensive, but that's expected for a place like this. I do recommend getting the Bang Bang Grouper, it was delicious. The Butter Chicken had a very distinctive curry flavor that wasn't a favorite for many of the people I came with. Their menu is really extensive, but I noticed there aren't a lot of chicken options. I would still like to come back and try the rest of the items though!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I've experienced in Charlotte. They ran out of the food for most of our entrees and never brought some of the items. Great food when it did arrive!"}
{"text":"This place is really good! I went with a group of 5 and everyone really liked everything they ordered. They have just about every kind of food- Indian, Greek, Italian, Mexican, American.. And they do all of them well. They also have a ton of great speciality drinks!"}
{"text":"Enzo sushi roll is outstanding!! Ceviche is really good but chips were homemade and too chewy. Mushrooms were fried and good. Funky smell when you enter the restaurant like salty sea water. Fast, kind, good service."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and got the LAMB KEFTA SANDWICH with waffle fries.  The lamb was cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor.  The harrisa on the lamb burger added a nice kick and extra flavor.  I would go back and try other items.  The service was good.  The internal design was done really well.  Note if you go at lunch time and get the tacos the tacos are the size of your palm."}
{"text":"This is a great place in the midst of downtown Charlotte for lunch or dinner! Not only do you have a great view, the food is just as good.   Our favorite dishes are: 1. Warm Brussel Sprout Caesar Salad. This dish is amazing and I am always craving it. The Brussels Sprouts are shredded and dressed with their amazing dressing. This is a must try for sure! 2. Essex Burger as well. This comes with pork belly on top of the burger meat. The flavors are so delicious together.  3. Kalbi Beef. The combinations and flavors of this dish are a perfect combination. The parsnip puree brought the dish together.  4. Fried Cauliflower. The sauce for this dish is mesmerizing and compliments the food very well!  5. Coconut Curry Mussels. The sauce was creamy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot and highly recommend the hummus, waffle fries and the caramel cheesecake dessert"}
{"text":"Lovely space and great food.  I ordered take out on my first visit and the bartender was so helpful with recommending different things on the menu, he was very familiar with everything  and answered all my many questions.  I tried the butter chicken served with a gigantic piece of naan, made in house.  The butter chicken was so good with the naan, but I do wish that rice was served with it.   My next visit was dine in and sadly the waiter was not very knowledgeable, and not very nice but thankfully the food made up for it.  The blackened fish tacos served with a salad was so good, nicely presented and very filling.  Love the addition to uptown."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great drinks, the personnel is sweet, and the atmosphere and ambiance is unique- steampunk meets the basement bar you always wanted. We only got drinks and a Baked Alaska here but everything was tasty. Will definitely be back the next time I'm in charlotte."}
{"text":"I am in Charlotte attending a convention and saw the reviews of this place and had to try it out. The bartender was amazing.  Even though it was very busy he was on it with service. I have a new fave drink the Fall Blossom.  I had to try the Korean Bbq Shrimp tacos and they did not disappoint. How the pack so much flavor in a small taco. They are really messy to eat but I enjoyed every bite.  The best was the Apple Kale salad.  It was hands down the best salad I have ever had. Don't expect a bitter bite from the kale this salad almost tasted like a slaw. Glad I followed reviews and tried this place."}
{"text":"So I'm a people watcher and if you are as nosy or even just a bit nosy like moi, then you'll certainly get that from this place. That is only if you sit outside. The inside was pretty dark. I would say the inside ambiance is good for drinks after work or date night. Outside was good for me and my peoples. We were doing some heavy people watching.   I feel like this should be a tapas place because the portions were lacking. I thought my homies dish was tacos but it was small shrimps in olive oil sauce with some naan. I had really small Lobster tacos which were good, but thank God for the bread, or I would have had to stop at a Burger joint.   The brussel sprouts were pretty tasty. I'd definitely recommend that if you decide to venture here.   Also our server was on point. He was patient and all up in our convo (in a good way). I appreciate a little banter with my food.   Will I go back? Nah.   This is just one of the spots I can, \"Yea, been there done that.\""}
{"text":"Ryan made my night.  Look for the red headed bar back.  He's the greatest.  Seriously though, my drinks weren't skimpy and the staff paid loads of attention to me as a loan guest sitting at the bar.  Just what I was looking for, tonight."}
{"text":"Timing is inaccurate on yelp !! We thought they are open till 11 and they close at 10 on Mondays. But they went out of the way to accommodate us. Food was great !! Will definitely come here next time I am in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with friends and my family during a trip to Charlotte. I had the warm Brussel sprout Caesar salad and Korean BBQ shrimps tacos. Awesome! The salad was unique and delicious. Warning: they say their plates are small, but they are not that small. I was starving and thought those 2 dishes would not be enough, but I was full after just the salad."}
{"text":"We went for restaurant week and loved it. Poke tacos were amazing as was the butter chicken. My husband had the short rib ravioli and that was to die for. Outside of restaurant week it would be a little pricey but now that I've tried it is can say it's worth it"}
{"text":"Walked in for a table for 2... were told it would be a 30 minute wait.   Decided to sit at the bar - many tables were actually open.   Bar tenders very friendly- gave a good recommendation where to go after.   Menu was very versatile and we ordered a few plates.  Brussel sprout Cesar salad was very tasty as well as the Tuna Tartare, Bang Bang Grouper- delicious   Portions very small for the price for Tapas."}
{"text":"So it's probably a cool place late night but for a mid-afternoon drink, I'd advise avoiding."}
{"text":"Solid food. The waitstaff appeared bothered that we had come to join them. Not indicating it's this way each time but for our visit it was. The atmosphere is somewhat loud but still feels alive and exciting. The food was great in areas and ok in others. If you chose to order the salmon note that they heavily seer this. This is not my preference but it is their standard. Their side dish with potatoes, carrots and creamed spinach is a winner. I also ordered the chicken curry. This is a yellow curry and it's spot on. Moderate heat and perfect taste. The other dish we ordered was the steak which was also charred. This seemed to be their technique and would recommend sharing how you like your food. Worth a visit and enjoyed it overall."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Essex based off it being tapas style and having great reviews.  The food was really great and so was our service.  I found out that it has only been open for a few weeks which made the experience even more impressive. I will certainly be back.  I believe this restaurant is on my top 4 favorite restaurants in Charlotte that include Soul, Workman's Friend and The Fig Tree.   The short rib ravioli is very rich but great to split between a few people.  Calamari was tasty along with the butter chicken and the churrasco (chimichuri steak skewer).  Flavors were very nice and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The worst service ever. We reserved a room for a private event. Upon arrival we were told that the back door which led to the room we had reserved had to be open to the public. The manager was extremely rude to our group. He even told us that if we didn't take out a decoration we had placed on the wall we needed to leave.  We were also charged a \"mysterious\" extra 22% on top of the regular service fee. I used to go here for lunch with coworkers pretty regularly but I am never going back here again."}
{"text":"Starting with the positive, this is a busy place. We went around 9 on a Friday and they were definitely hopping inside. We asked to sit on the patio (not sure if we just got there at a good time, but there were plenty of seats outside) and we were immediately seated.   The drinks were strong (major plus), and the food truly was delicious. Our favorites were the veal meatballs (the best and most tender meatballs I've ever had), and the lamb sliders (this was extremely delicious, you won't go to many burger places that serve a burger as flavorful and perfectly cooked as this one).  The service was quite slow at the beginning, and our waiter assured us that it was busier inside. However a drunk driver had been pulled over next to the restaurant and it seemed every single waiter kept coming outside to stand and watch (that really affected my experience and it was extremely unprofessional). I guess they weren't as busy as or waiter said if they all had time to do this?  Overall it was a great experience, I think they just need to train their staff better."}
{"text":"Hate to knock a 4 star but I thought the south was known for there hospitality, this place hah. Literally never got our apps:when they finally decided to bring the rest of the meal we mentioned this and they said \"that's not how our restaurant works we bring what's ready\" ok... well guess the apps were never ready. And by apps I mean the cappuccino and other drinks we ordered too. By the end of it we just cut our losses and asked for check. Food was ok. Not anything worth the terrible service. Won't be back and save yourself the headache from the loud atmosphere and terrible service unless you're desperate."}
{"text":"First thing you should know- this is a small plates or tapas style restaurant and as such, it should not be labeled as $$.  Our server recommended 4 entrees for two people.  We got 3 (Korean BBQ shrimp tacos, Kalbi beef, and Butter chicken - all delish) and our bill was definitely $$$.  Maybe it's me, but I had no idea based on the Yelp information or the website.  Yes I'm sure people mentioned it in their reviews but you don't always have time to check reviews and honestly, I don't think you should have to.  Bottom line, this place had great food but I was specifically looking for a less expensive option for a random Wednesday night and wasn't thrilled that it wasn't made clear on the restaurant's website or Yelp description."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been twice, both times with another couple. We have all enjoyed it. Excellent in many ways, First, location close to Epic Center and other venues for options after dinner. Decor and feel are upscale. Service has been good; we've gone on the early side. The best part is the food. Excellent flavors and fun tapas style for sharing. Four to five dishes are adequate for four people. $45-50 per couple. The main disappointment for craft beer lovers is a surprisingly mediocre selection."}
{"text":"Fantastic ambience, service was really good and the most important part, the food, was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great vibe and enviornment.  Loved the food!!! menu seemed to have a little bit of everything from mussels to butter chicken. The butter chicken with the naan bread was amazing. It had a bit of a fusion twist but we werent dissapointed. Staff was super friendly. Will be back, esp for that delicious naan!!!"}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick drink to see what it was all about. Great atmosphere and bar staff was awesome! Will be back to try the food very soon!"}
{"text":"Food - (4/5) Great selection and delicious food. But it's tapas aka really small servings. I would not come here hungry.  Drinks - (5/5) The adult beverages may not pack a punch but they're pretty tasty and flavorful.  Service - (5/5) Service has always been on point when I've visited here.   Location - (5/5) Smack dab in Uptown on Trade and Tryon. You can't really get more central than that. Parking Uptown can be a challenge though.  Venue - (5/5) It's a chic spot yet not too fancy schmancy. More like intimate, business casual kind of spot. The decor is just to my liking, rustic and industrial yet warm and inviting.   Value - (4/5) You're paying for the central location, decor and atmosphere. The food is great too but it's a bit pricey so Essex is a great date night option."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal here. Each of us in our party ordered things we wanted to try and shared (which they encourage.). Everything we had was wonderful. The short rib ravioli really stood out. So tender it just melted in my mouth. The butter chicken was my second favorite. We tried about 6 different dishes. Everything was superb! The service was just as great. Knowledgeable of the menu and never left us needing or waiting for something. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Meetup group here for dinner and cookie exchange.  Our group was located in front of the restaurant which was so noisy that I was not able to hear people talking one chair away as well as across from my location.  Tip- Request for seating further back. Not as noisy.  There were two waiters who provided service for nine people.  One waiter was taking an order and then skipped to another person before the person finished placing their order.  The waiter relayed that this was a tapas and the food was enough to share and should place two orders. I ordered the lamb slider which was two small pieces. How am I going to share this with 8 other people.   The Lamb sliders were so spicy that I needed water and had to flagged down the waiter for a refill. They were not attentive when it came to refilling water. Place was dark maybe hard to see?  I ended up enjoying the cookies from the exchange more so than the food."}
{"text":"Essex has become our new go-to when we want a nice meal with a lot of variety. My favorites are: Butter chicken, calamari, short rib sliders, short rib flat bread and the tuna tacos. The restaurant executes all of the varieties of food so well! He food is 100% five-star worthy. My only constructive feedback is that it's always very chilly inside the restaurant and sometimes the music gets a little too loud for dinner at 7:30PM."}
{"text":"Went to dinner this past Saturday night for a friends birthday.  We had been sitting for about 10 minutes when we were informed the bathrooms are now out of order due to a water issue and the restaurant would be closing soon (guests were being sat the entire time we were eating, still sitting people when we left).  They gave us an option to stay or leave.  We decided to stay considering it was 8-830 on a Saturday night and it would be impossible to get a reservation somewhere else.  About 15-20 minutes later we were told they were no longer serving cocktails, only beer and wine.  We were a little confused why they were not serving cocktails especially because later we saw the table beside us receiving cocktails.  We were definitely a little annoyed with how our dinner experience was going but never once complained about it or voiced our opinion about it to our server, having worked in the food industry we understood this was out of our servers hands and didn't reflect her service.  That changed when the server, Amber M, dropped our checks off, didn't say one thing when she dropped them off just placed them on the table.  After taking a look we were confused on why we were being charged a 20% service gratuity, there was only 4 of us at the table.  We asked the manager about the gratuity charge and he said she should have not done that and he will have a talk with her.  With all of the inconveniences going on with the restaurant that night never once did a manager come up to our table to apologize or even apologize about the server trying to charge us a service gratuity.  We have all worked in the food industry and we know things happen that you cannot control but this was absolutely ridiculous.  And I have never worked or been in a restaurant where the manager doesn't at least check in with tables or even walk around on the floor for that matter.  Food was okay, service was terrible."}
{"text":"Love love love! We enjoyed alot of small plates! Everything we tried was delicious. Next stop i will try the shrimp scampi"}
{"text":"Unique fun/casual atmosphere, simple yet thoughtful ingredients and solid service makes this my new favorite Charlotte restaurant.  Not to mention the dishes are affordable. Will be a regular for no doubt."}
{"text":"In town for a conference at convention center. Excellent for quick, excellent tapas snack or a full meal. Lively place, lots of afterwork groups."}
{"text":"Dined on a cold Saturday night few weeks ago. Tried to reserve table but they were full between 6:30-8:30 so we showed up anyway and got a table pretty easy. May have been due to the chilly night.  Menu has many good items to try. I wish we were with a larger group. Each item and drinks are around $15 each so it adds up quickly when trying several things. Most items are only enough for 2 people so you need to order a few to fill up. We were served super fast. Food came out way to fast and would have enjoyed if they staggered them to enjoy our meal better.  Brussel spout ceasar salad was ok Triple dip was delicious. Wonderful guacamole! Short Rib homemade ravioli was delicious! (and I'm not usually a short rib fan) Mahi bites were delicious. Didn't expect fried but sauce and fish was wonderful"}
{"text":"Great place for a large or small group. Big variety of apps and mains to share. We always get the shrimp and grits and this go round we had 12 ppl in our party so we literally had almost every thing on the menu twice.  Favs are:  Bang Bang grouper Cheese plate Pork belly buns Cauliflower  Baked Alaska"}
{"text":"My friend and I grabbed lunch at Essex on a Tuesday afternoon.  We arrived about 10 minutes before noon to avoid the lunch rush, and it was a good thing we did!  By the time we left at a little before 1 p.m., the restaurant was packed.  If you are coming with a group, be sure to call ahead for a reservation.  The venue is absolutely beautiful.  There is a large patio that sits on the square - we didn't eat out there, but it looked great.  The interior has a nice mix of textures - wood, brick and fabrics that are very pleasing.    The service was impeccable - fast, friendly and helpful.  The menu at Essex is very unique with flavors from all over the world - surely something to suit everyone.  I had the warm brussel sprout chicken caesar salad.  The brussel sprouts had the perfect amount of crunch, the asiago caesar dressing was very flavorful and the chicken was perfectly moist.  My friend had the blackenened grouper tacos with a side salad.  The tacos were stuffed full of tasty grouper and the side salad was crisp and quite large.  Overall, our experience was wonderful.  I'm excited to go back!"}
{"text":"The brunch menu was very diverse and the food was not bad.  The service was deplorable.  We ordered all at the same time (party of 6) but our food came out separately over the course of about 15 minutes.  When it came time to pay the check, they were all wrong and several things we asked to take off were still on the checks.  In general, the server was not customer focused and seemed overwhelmed.  When we arrived, it was not busy at all, but it took a really long time to get anything done once it did get busy.  Just do better. Y'all tryna ruin my pride!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant per a friend's recommendation, and my goodness. I think I've found my heaven on earth. Okay that's probably a bit extreme, but seriously, this place is AMAZING.  This is a mediterranean, tapas restaurant. We came for dinner, so I can't speak on how their lunch menu is. Every single thing we ordered was 1) delicious and 2) came out so fast. It was like my table was the only table in the house. Kudos, Essex for being so speedy!  Below are some of the things we tried and I would order them again in a heartbeat. If you haven't tried out Essex, you need to move this place to the top of your list!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Good drinks, great food. Our waiter Patrick took great care of us. We trusted him to pick all our food for us to share and it was all amazing."}
{"text":"Wow... I am so so impressed.  I would describe the food as gourmet fusion from all around the world. You have to go with a group and order tapas style. I would recommend getting at least 2-3 dishes per person and sharing (which is absolutely my favorite way to eat). Everything was so amazing!  Definitely come with a group of 3-4 people and order at least 6 dishes. So amazing. Will be a regular for sure.  Kudos to the staff for excellent recommendations and excellent service."}
{"text":"My meal and experience was on point at Essex. I was very surprised because typically when you're located in the heart of downtown, you don't have to be amazing to have a full house, it's the location that will keep the people flowing in. But with Essex, I would find my way there: beautiful atmosphere, food presentation and great flavor. It's small plates from around the world, you can't classify it as only Mediterranean because they really do have an almost odd assortment of dishes.   We ordered the butter chicken curry which is served with a bread-stick looking piece of naan and is delicious, creamy and flavorful. We also ordered the brussels sprout salad, a very large portion and served warm not chilled. Tuna tartar tacos come with a side of seaweed/cilantro slaw and of course the bang bang shrimp which packs a powerful punch of heat. We even ordered dessert because everything was so delicious and were not disappointed with the strawberry, mango, vanilla tort [wasn't a \"must get dessert good\" but I'm much more of a salty than sweet person]. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed Essex, it was truly delicious and they're really doing it right in multiple ways. I'd definitely recommend it for a group of people (it's easy to make a reservation on Open Table) or for a date."}
{"text":"Service was so bad!! The answer to every question from our apparently annoyed server was an abrupt, \"no.\"  We spent $110 in 45 minutes and the service was very bad.  Food was fair at best, we will not return."}
{"text":"We stayed with my brother and his family for a week and ate out 6 days in a row.  Of all the places we ate, this was hands down the best!  We had the bread and hummus appetizer, it was out of this world!  I got the special that day which was a chicken sandwich with brie, candied bacon and sun dried tomatoes.  It was delicious and the chicken was so tender.  I had sweet potato waffle fries as a side, also excellent!"}
{"text":"The food in Charlotte is delicious, but Essex is on another level! Tapas is the way to go because you can eat a little bit of a lot of things."}
{"text":"Came here to try somewhere new and loved it! Our server explained their tapas style menu and my fiance and I both ordered two plates and a dessert and were stuffed by the end of it with some really delicious food. Their menu is very unique and full of lots of interesting dishes. I absolutely loved the Tuna Poke Tacos and the plate actually filled me up quite a bit despite being one of their smaller ones. I ended up having my Mediterranean Dip Trio packed up to take home (which I completely forgot and left at the restaurant!). My fiance really enjoyed the Stuffed Mushroom plate (which was probably the smallest of the plates we ordered) and the Kalbi Beef Tacos. We both saved room for dessert and enjoyed the Baked Alaska and Beignoli which were both amazing. All in all, this was a great choice of restaurant, it was very nice with very attentive staff members, our waiter came by to check on us every 5-10 minutes and I know he had a bunch of other tables around us too, and we never had to ask for refills or anything, and the other staff that were maybe between things to do would even come by and take an empty plate, so it really felt like all of them were very attentive to every customer in the restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice new restaurant to try with an excellent menu and great staff, and it's not too pricey at all. We will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Holy moly! I think I had Lve at first sip! I ordered a lemon martini and I did not know what to expect because although I DO love lemons and I Do love martinis, there was only ever one other place that was amazing. Now Essex Bar takes the lead on my choice of martinis with   Yum!   Next, I ordered a cranberry and vodka  and Sprite and asked for a touch of grenadine for pink's sake!! For foo foo appeal I suppose.  They did not disappoint! I forget the mixologist's name but I will be going back as soon as I get back!"}
{"text":"Great space and staff was great. Went for drinks and dessert. Dessert was good but drinks were terrible. Worst old fashioned's I've ever had. Bartender needs to step up his game."}
{"text":"Great food and a huge menu!  I'm not normally a fan of tapas restaurants- usually that just means the restaurant is going to give you tiny portions at 80% of the cost of a full meal, and you end up ordering 3!  Not here, the portions are BIG.  Yes, smaller than a full meal but still bigger than average tapas.   I went for restaurant week- it was a salad, 2 plates and a dessert and that was waaaaay too much food. If I went on an average day, I'd split 3 plates with my husband and that would be plenty.   I got the grouper- it was in a sweet and spicy sauce- so tasty.  I also got the tuna tacos, also delicious!  I would definitely go back since there was a lot on the menu I wanted to try.    The only negatives I have: The waiter was not friendly- but that's pretty much how restaurant week always is.  And second, it's really loud- but that's also how all new restaurants are now.  Prepare to yell!"}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was wonderful. We ate all around the world in one sitting. Unlike many fusion restaurants they do a great job mixing it up."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a group of 8.  Portions are all over the place (they claim not to be tapas for lunch). Service was just okay. Quick but dismissive and stood at the head of a long table to get everyone's order (annoying for those of us who had to yell at the server so he could hear us.  Hummus was good but what they call Naan isn't naan at all.  Shawarma Tacos were incredibly dry and too small to be considered a meal.  Greek salad was over dressed.  Chicken Bahn Mi was nothing like a Bahn Mi, it was a barbecue chicken sandwich with kimchee on it. Really terrible.  This was my second time giving this place a shot with very similar results. I will not be back. As a Chef, I can say that whoever is creating the dishes and menu has no idea what they're doing."}
{"text":"Restaurant Week may not be the best time to try a very popular restaurant but Essex has been top of the list to try.  Parking can be difficult to find but Essex validates parking at 205 S church St.  With reservations we were quickly seated and on a Tuesday night the restaurant was extremely crowded.  The restaurant was extremely loud and hard for my party of 6 to hear each other talk across the table.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and nicely decorated. The patio is a great and is always crowded.  For restaurant week Essex offered a great deal, a soup or salad, 2 small plates and a dessert for $35. I started with a Greek salad which was ok. I ordered the butter chicken and the ham, sausage and bacon flat bread. The flat bread was good but I enjoyed the braised short rib flat bread that a friend ordered. The butter chicken was really good and tasted pretty authentic. The naan bread was great and I probably could've ate the naan bread by itself. For dessert I ordered the tiramisu which was really good.   Overall I enjoyed the dinner with friends and the atmosphere of the restaurant. I could see myself coming back for a happy hour or dinners with friends."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My boyfriend and I went the night after it opened and sat outside on the patio. The patio is really nice and all the food we ate was so good! Definitely order the butter chicken- it was delicious!"}
{"text":"OMG...yummy to my tummy!  So many choices, there should be something for nearly everyone who enjoys light fare.  Though our server was just O-k... we easily found 9 excellent selections that hit our spots.  The decor is very nice with very pleasant staff.  We were looking forward to enjoy sitting upon the patio, unfortunately, being literally at city center, the plaza hosted a protest group -- this particular one was a bit more controversial than usual.  A great addition to Charlotte's cuisine community."}
{"text":"This is one of the loudest restaurants I've ever been in. We ordered the cheese plate that was an assortment of the chefs pick. I expect when a menu doesn't tell you what the cheeses are the staff should tell you what your being served when it's delivered- they did not. So we asked our waitress when she came by and she could only name 3 of the 5 and could only point out the blue cheese. We had to ask multiple times to receive previously ordered drinks. I was served red wine in a hot and wet wine glass. The food was good but with such poor service it made our experience bad."}
{"text":"Later in the evening dinner after an event uptown. Excellent patio to enjoy the spring weather. And people watch :) We ordered several items to share and everything was really good. Butter Chicken, Mussels, Brussels Sprout salad, a beef dish, I can't recall the name of.   Service was pretty good. We moved from the room next to the patio because it was freezing in there when a table opened up on the patio. Definitely recommend this spot. Cool looking bar and interior of the weather doesn't permit patio seating."}
{"text":"Butter chicken, charcuterie, short rib ravioli and beet salad are all must haves.    Definitely impressed with the service as well."}
{"text":"In addition to the awesome food and atmosphere they have a fantastic bartender, Mark, who surpassed any expectation I had and delivered a truly excellent experience. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was very sub par.  I ordered the fruit and yogurt parfait and it was plain yogurt which should have been noted.  The whole table received their food and mine comes 20 minutes later with eggs cooked completely wrong I might add.  Then they were supposed to take off the parfait and charged us.  I would suggest you go somewhere else!!!!"}
{"text":"Only rate this way because I expected a little more for the new trendy restaurant . I have to say I did arrive \"late\" 9:30 pm and it is Charlotte on a Tuesday night so it was ghost town but the restaurant was not to close until 11pm . In walking in we were told the kitchen was closing in 15min. So we ordered as rushed as we could had the mushroom appetizer it was great and different. I had the churro  skirt steak and deconstructed scallop potatoes. Great concept but my food was at best room temp. So don't want to wonder why the last meal out of the kitchen was cold  but it was taken off the check .  Great glass wear for drinks that was a treat. So maybe go for drinks but to many places in Charlotte for food not saying I wouldn't go back but just not past 7 for dinner."}
{"text":"Poki tuna tacos are legit good. Note these are raw so if that's not your thing try the mushroom flatbread- it was also very good. The restaurant space is indoor/outdoor seating. We chose the outdoor and it was gorgeous especially this time of the year. I would stop by..."}
{"text":"This place is a definite go-to spot for date night, girls night out or to take out of town guests. Their specialty is small plates but the portions are still quite reasonable and the flavor of the dishes are excellent!! I've ordered the following: warm Brussel sprout Caesar salad, butter chicken, bang bang grouper, Gambas, Kalbi beef, pistachio chocolate mousse tacos, and beignoli's. The Caesar salad, bang bang grouper and pistachio tacos are not to be missed!! The menu has so many delicious options that it's very likely you could find something that would please everyone in your group."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place because I was hoping the food scene in downtown Charlotte was improving. Alas, not sure why it has 4 stars. Both my friend and I older the Moscow mule which tasted like lime simple syrup and my friend who got the Collins which tasted like watered down vodka - for $12 cocktails in Charlotte they need some work. The ceviche and Brussels sprouts salad was pretty good but the shawarma pita had too much going on. Also for the size of the dishes it was a bit overpriced for Charlotte. Also our dear waitress wouldn't leave us alone for 5 minutes - she interrupted us so many times. I appreciate the attention but you need to give people time to eat and chat - well find you when we need service. I promise!"}
{"text":"I rarely ever post reviews, but I feel strongly this one is necessary. I waited tables for many years and understand that every experience isn't perfect, things get busy/stressful and that it's hard work. With that being said, I know bad service, training and poor overall organization of an establishment when I see it.  My family and I dined at Essex last night for dinner (table of 8). I've eaten at Essex 3 different times and sat at the bar w/one person during 'off hours'. My experiences all three times were good, hence the family dinner reservation. Last night's dining experience was sub-par at best. After being sat, we waited ~ 20 minutes before anyone took our drink orders or even came to the table. The waitress didn't address the whole table once...hi, I'm your server, has anyone been here before, here are recommendations, etc. It took another 20 minutes to receive our drinks or have anyone come back to the table. The waitress then brought a wrong drink order after I watched it being said correctly to her. Two more were made/entered incorrectly.   Because of how long we'd already been sat and the long amount of time it took to just receive our drinks, we decided to order everything at the same time. We specified 3 appetizer orders to be placed first (this should be obvious when you state, 'We'd like to start with these 3 appetizer orders before our dinner.'). We followed with our dinner orders. I would expect the waitstaff to mention here if the system for delivering food is different than that.   This is where lack of organization and poorly run 'system' became horribly apparent. The food started coming out in terrible sequence. Two people got their dinners first after people/runners shouted out what the meal was to the table. Then a long lag time...no other plates delivered for ~10-15 min. This continued in 3-4 more phases with 1-2 people getting their meal followed by a longer than acceptable wait time between each. The appetizers were delivered dispersed throughout the dinner orders arriving to the table...one coming next to last. My dad's dinner was finally delivered at the very, very end after the whole table had their food for some time. After all this, the waitress never came back to check in, see how the meals were, if we needed anything else. This is basic etiquette no matter where you are waiting.   We had to waive her down to place additional drink orders. Then, she only checked with half the table. I had to stop her as she walked away & before she disappeared for another 20 min to ask that she take orders from the other half of the table! We originally planned to get desserts & after-dinner drinks. After this ridiculously disappointing experience, we got the check and moved to a different restaurant instead hoping to have a more positive experience to end the night.  I will also note that it's 'restaurant week' and dining out during this week is busy. I am still unaware, however, if Essex even participates in this week?? If so, we certainly weren't told that at the beginning of our night at Essex. If so, we also never saw a 'restaurant week' menu or were informed of the menu/deals specific to that.   Very, very disappointing experience for an anticipated fun, relaxing and rare night out for the whole family. ***************************  Ashley, in response to your comment below...we dined at Essex on Saturday, Jan. 21st. Our reservations were for 8 people at 8pm."}
{"text":"My girlfriend treated me to dinner for my birthday Monday the 22nd of August at a new restaurant in Charlotte called Essex. When we arrived the restaurant was not to busy and we were able to get a table on the patio with in a minute or so. From there on the night continued to be grand. Our server Charlie was awesome, he provided detailed recommendations for both food and wine, and pretty much chose what we ate and drank. All of which was amazing. If you haven't been yet the butter chicken and short rib ravioli is a must! Plus if all servers are like the one we had, let them choose you're wine. (Will be going back)"}
{"text":"So my friend and I are not from Charlotte. We made the journey from Portland, Oregon to take our board exams. The first night we ate at an awful pizza joint, but thankfully, we found Essex the next night! The service was remarkable.....the waitress that assisted in taking our order was very friendly. We ordered the shrimp and grits and a calamari dish. Both were amazing but the shrimp and grits were above and beyond. We sat at an area outside overlooking the street on the patio. The atmosphere was really amazing.....except my seat was facing the building and the area where the trays for bussing tables were held. We weren't able to move though, even though it was pretty empty when we visited. The waitress told us that since we were a party of two, most of the seats outside were for four people...or larger parties, and that some of the seats might be reserved. Overall though, food was good and service was great"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was hip, crowded but not to loud, a place you want to be. Food was mostly tapas style. Server said order two plates per person and we left satisfied, unlike some of the other tapas spots in town. Kale salad was the best I've had. Like best salad ever. My husband hates kale. Beef was cooked well on the sopresitas and tuna tartare outstanding.  Great menu, food was fantastic!  Only four stars because the Shwarma meat was a hair dry, but server was quick to suggest a sauce to help. Service was good, nothing over the top, but good.  Would absolutely go back. Worth parking Uptown. And also great food for the price. Great wine list too."}
{"text":"I wasn't blown away. I was told this place was awesome. I am not sure if it all went down hill because it was the coldest night in charlotte and their building layout affects the ventilation carrying the air into the restaurant..... or the fact our server didn't have the slightest training or idea about their menu. Not only that, even the people delivering the food to the table didn't know what we were getting, this happened multiple times.   We ordered about twenty of their dishes. The lamb sliders were a bit dry. The potato gnocchi was undercooked. We had so many other things but I will just jump to the ones that stood out....this is what was actually delicious:   1) fried cauliflower 2)Butter chicken- it s their version of the tikka masala and it was wonderful. It is also served with their homemade bread which is absolutely fluffy and yummy!  3) cheese and charcuterie plate- chef selection also served w the bread  4) tuna poke tacos  5) for dessert the golden apple and the strawberry mousse.   Thank you! Happy eating."}
{"text":"Pricey. They say it is tapas style but portions are much larger than tapas you'd get in Spain. It was a hopping place for a midweek dinner. Definitely a place to see and be seen.   I was there on business and dining alone. Had a great beverage and two dishes. One was a fried grouper dish with a spicy sauce, and the second shrimp and grits. Both were tasty but I didn't think they warranted the ~$15 price tag. Shrimp and grits was way too salty but otherwise had great rich flavors.  Super nice waiter. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, eclectic international fare. I have been for lunch multiple times and some of my favorite items are:  1. Greek salad with chicken. It is delicious with fresh  and flavorful ingredients.   2. Butter Chicken. The name is confusing. This is really almost an Indian Tikka Masala and it is delicious!  3. Falafel Pita. Spot on and delicious.   In the summer try the nice outdoor seating right on the Square downtown. It sits a few feet higher than the sidewalk and provides some separation yet it allows you to really feel the energy of uptown at the same time!"}
{"text":"This is a place I'm going to put on my list to try under 'normal' circumstances. Went here on a Tuesday night (7-25-17) around 8:00 pm for Restaurant Week and the place was SLAMMED. As a result, the service was extremely spotty throughout the entire meal.  Essex is a beautiful space with a large, open patio and interior dining area. I met up with a group of fellow Yelp elites as we had a reservation (six in total). We each placed our orders and waited for the food to arrive. While waiting, I took note of how extremely loud it was. We were seated at the very front and I had to shout across the table and ask for things to be repeated because of the high noise level. When I got up to use the bathroom, I noticed how much quieter it is/was, the further you go back.  The orders were brought out in a staggered fashion. We all ordered salads as the first course, however, they didn't all come out at the same time. Then our second courses came, one by one, not all at once, and so on.  As for my choice of food:  First course - greek salad. Nothing really of note about the salad. I asked the waitress for no feta, and after waiting around, the salad came out with, you guessed it, feta. I ate around it.  Second courses - shrimp and scallop ceviche and lobster tacos. The ceviche was beautifully presented and tasted very light and fresh. The lobster tacos were extremely small and fried a little too hard. I was not a fan of those. Not much flavor and not at all worth their normal menu price of $19.  Dessert - tiramisu. Not a typical tiramisu, in that no real layers of ladyfingers were to be found and not much coffee-flavoring either. This was more of a tiramisu pudding and I don't believe it's on their normal dessert menu which should tell you something.  It's always disappointing when a meal you've been looking forward to is marred by unsatisfactory service and subpar food. Restaurant Week is always a great time to find out how efficiently a restaurant can run things and the Essex staff seemed quite overwhelmed and confusingly unprepared. The place is located right in the heart of Uptown, I'm sure Friday/Saturday nights are a nightmare. Essex promotes itself as a 'premium craft bar\" but I couldn't find anything premium about the food nor service.  Major tip about parking - park in the Auto Park parking deck on 260 S Church St and the host/hostess will validate your parking. That little thing was the best part of my Essex experience.  Like I said, I plan to go back and will hopefully be able to report back differently."}
{"text":"This place serves tapas plates. I wasn't aware of that so it's a good thing I wasn't very hungry. The food was pretty good, but overpriced. My husband had the fish & chips; my daughter had the skirt steak. Both of them said their food could have used a bit more seasoning. I had the butter chicken, an Indian dish. It was definitely seasoned well and tasty, but a little too salty. The atmosphere is very nice. If you don't mind spending a decent amount of money for a little bit of food, try this place. I think you'll like it."}
{"text":"We had a 7:00 reservation for a party of 9.  The table was ready at 6:50 and 6 of us were seated. At 7:20, I had to let the hostess know we had seen a server or had anyone come to our table. We sat for 20 minutes before the first glass of water was poured. The manager came over and apologized. We ordered drinks and appetizers. Another 15 minutes went by before we had our drinks. We ordered as soon as the drinks arrived. There was dirty silverware found on the table. The appetizers came out rather quickly. The next batch of food came out and the appetizer plates were not cleared. Everything was left on the table, including the menus. We had to ask to see a desert menu, the huge happy 40th birthday balloon must not have been a good indicator. The desert arrived along with a stack of plates and spoons. Some of the plates were chipped and dirty. I went to throw the plate away and a male server grabbed it from me, before I could explain it was dirty & chipped. He was rather rude in his demeanor and grabbed it from my hands.  We sat for another 20 minutes waiting for the server and we asked for our checks. I've been writing this review while waiting for our server to return so I can give her my credit card.  The food was okay, it was  a bit over-seasoned. It was also over priced. The restaurant was very loud and it was hard to hear each other talk.  I will not return to Essex. I could think of a much better places to go, where I won't have to wait a total of 60 additional minutes  in a loud restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is very good! You can tell that the ingredients are fresh! We went here for lunch, and I had tacos (with a side salad that was fantastic!) and my husband had one of the pitas (I forgot which one!), and it was all very good! Sadly I wasn't all that hungry that afternoon, as I would have loved to have tried more things! We will have to be back sometime, soon. Service was super friendly, but just a tad slow (and not crazy busy).. But I would definitely recommend this place to someone who is thinking of trying it! (although some of the prices are a tad high, but I *fully* understand that it costs more to get local and higher quality items, so that does not go against them in my review, at all!)"}
{"text":"Went on Valentine's Day (probably in the top 3 busiest days in restaurant industry).  Service was a tiny bit slow but I won't knock them for that because of the volume of people eating on V-day at 7 pm.  Tables were super close together and it was hard to sit without touching someone from another table, let alone getting out to go to the restroom.  Portions are meant to be shared, so they're not huge.  I split an appetizer (Mediterranean dip trio) and bottle of wine with a friend, plus the Asian style skirt steak entree and I left perfectly satsified, not stuffed.  Throughout the night, staff attempted to deliver an order to our table that none of us ordered (no fewer than 5 times).  They may not have their table numbers memorized but it was a weird mixup that kept happening.  The dips weren't the best I've had and I probably wouldn't spend $13 on it again, but the naan it came with was delicious and it staved off my hunger while waiting for the main course.  Also had a bite of the Churrasco which was delicious and another friend got the Korean BBQ shrimp tacos (super small portion).  Pretty place and probably really good service on a normal night.  I would come back but keep in mind you probably won't spend less than $40-50 a person to fill your stomach."}
{"text":"Waitstaff good, gave space and not too aggressive. Atmosphere the best thing about this place if you get a table inside toward the bar. Food quality - unimpressive and uninspiring. Korean steamed buns came on stiff cold slider rolls. Ceviche lacked tomato, wantons stale. Mushrooms slightly watery, just okay. Willing to spend money, but this place isn't worth the price."}
{"text":"For a girls night out, my friend suggested Essex which I had never heard of! I don't get downtown too often, so I was excited to try something new! Found out once we were there it's mostly a tapas place. The three of us decided to split the brussels sprouts Caesar salad. It was humongous and even had enough left over to take home! Very delicious and unique! Considering I only eat seafood, no meat, my friend and I split the Korean barbecue shrimp tacos. Although tiny, they were absolutely wonderful! Then my two friends split pork bun rolls and short ribs with puréed parsnips. They said both were delicious.   Our only disappointment was the fact that our waiter didn't even offer a dessert menu. I'm not big on desserts and was completely stuffed, but one of my friends is a big dessert fan and always wants to check out the list. After we asked for it he brought it, but nothing jumped out at her.   Definitely would try Essex again! Another complaint is the restaurant is extremely loud!"}
{"text":"Essex boasts itself as Charlotte's new and first uptown craft cocktail bar and gastropub. I can tell you right now that you cannot go wrong with drinks and appetizers here! On the corner of Trade and Tryon, this restaurant has lovely outdoor seating in the heart of the city as well as plenty of indoor space. This is the perfect stop for a cocktail and food after work. I recommend their Queen's Cup cocktail -- pimm's cup no. 1, champagne, cucumber, fresh lemon and mint. YUM! And for food, their Roasted Beat Salad and Essex Trip (garlic naan bread with 3 spreads, one being their amazing feta yogurt) are great selections!"}
{"text":"Beautiful bar and the appetizers were amazing, especially the dip trio and cauliflower with Indian spiced sauce. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of different upscale restaurants in Charlotte and this is by far THE BEST food in Charlotte! So divine!! Drinks were amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Dined here during the weekend after a convention at a nearby hotel. The place had a great ambiance. The food is fantastic and the staff waited us was excellent with a great attitude. The price is reasonable with the amount of food you received. Anyway, the food we ordered were delicious, to say the least.  The place seems like a hang-out for the younger age group. The restaurant gives you a very casual feel, but most of the customers that dined that night were really dressed up. I was just there for the weekend, so I'm not familiar with the nightlife, but I'm assuming most people are going to a club or going to a much fancier place, I'm not sure.  Anyway, we just dined in for the night and we were served with some delicious food and drinks."}
{"text":"Husband and I came to Essex, and it was pretty good. I requested a sweet creamy drink and got a mint beverage instead, no big deal. The food was good, and ambience was nice, but a bit loud."}
{"text":"Great drinks, tasty food, and an interesting outdoor setting make this uptown bar and bistro stand out.  Service was also great!"}
{"text":"First impression: Woaaah everyone here is so bougie!! Many people who dine here look like they came straight from the office, I love it! I see people sippin' on a glass of wine while enjoying their food. They have very, and I mean VERY dim lightning here. It gives it a very nice ambience though.. just don't take your grandparents like we did oops lol!! So we didn't realize that it was Tapas style here, ahh yasss another Tapas style restaurant. We ordered 10 dishes, yes 10 I know we can eat. Everything was good, my favorite would be the bang bang grouper. The shrimp taco had a very interesting flavor, and my only issue is that some of the dishes were over salted. Bring yo money when you come here because it's a little on the $$ side!! (:"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for brunch this afternoon. After being seated by the hostess who seemed she didn't want to be at work, we waited like 10 minutes before being acknowledged. The other servers were very attentive to the other tables and later on we noticed people getting acknowledged as soon as they were seated, so take from that what you want. I wanted to leave but my friend addressed the hostess about this issue and moments later our server came.   We both ordered passion fruit mimosas, which were overpriced and lacked champagne, but was very tasty. I ordered the huevos rancheros & my friend ordered the steak & eggs. The food came out fast and the presentation was great. I didn't like the sauce on my order and my egg was over cooked. They over cooked the egg on my friends dish as well (we both ordered over easy and got over hard) but she really liked her dish, even recommended it to this couple sitting across from us. I sent mine back and ordered their home fries and sauce (I tasted my friends dish and love that part of it, I don't eat meat so didn't try the actual steak) I also ordered 2 over easy eggs, which were again over hard.   I'm hoping I caught them on a off day, but the ambience was great and I would go back again to give them another try."}
{"text":"Good, and high quality-well prepared food but missed the mark for me somehow. I enjoyed the beet salad, and the freshness of the shrimp used in the gambas ajillo, and the quality of all ingredients was exceptionally high.  Portion sizes were actually massively generous, befitting the price but unexpected coming from Chicago and San Francisco where \"shared\" sometimes feels like a sophisticated-but-cruel joke. I would have preferred more flavor a less quantity though. Still, quality is super high so there's promise here - I think they could pare down the menu to a few truly exceptional options and have a winner.   I may have not ordered the best things on the menu and am happy to give the Essex another try."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant! I went here for lunch with a co-worker and we arrived just after the main lunch rush so we were happy we were able to get a table outside on the patio. It was a nice day so that was where the prime seats were. The ambiance inside was nice as well.   We had a great waitress and the food came out pretty quickly. We ordered the warm Brussels sprouts salad to share and each got an order of the Korean BBQ shrimp tacos with a side of waffle fries. I was so in love with the sauce on the tacos and very impressed with the house made tortillas and waffle fries. This was a wonderful selection by my co-worker and I will definitely have to go back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it here, but sadly, it was very underwhelming. I'm not a huge fan of those restaurants that have dishes from all over the world. I'd rather they pick a lane and stick in it.   We went on a double date with some friends, we all ordered wine and cocktails. We got 2 orders of the ceaser brussel sprout salad, al pastor tacos, kalbi beef, butter chicken, and an eggplant flatbread. None of it was memorable. However, at $13-$17 a pop it was definitely a pricey meal.  We mostly just felt like we overpaid for a meal that wasn't very special."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. My only knockdown would be the drinks, especially their craft cocktails. They always tend to be on the weak side, and either we request an extra shot (which we pay for) or just send it back and get a standard drink. I'll definitely keep going back until this place gets overrun by hipsters, then time to find a new go to dinner spot."}
{"text":"This is likely the most challenging review to write. My opinions differ on the quality of the food and the service. While the food is exceptional, the service needs some serious work. As such, I am going to go with 3 stars.   My sister picked this restaurant to have my grandmothers 98th birthday dinner. The number of people attending was between 20-30., as such, we were seated in a semi- private room in the front of the restaurant. The reservation was set for 7pm. Admittedly, people continued to stroll in until about 8pm.  Of note, the majority of the patrons were coming from out of town, and had a difficult time with finding the location of this restaurant. I too struggled with finding parking. I ended up parking about 3 blocks away.   Since we did have a large group, the expectation was that we would have at least two servers. There was one male who was working our room. He appeared to be frazzled by the work he would have to do  for our group. He started out with taking drink orders. This took longer than it should have. It also was not done with errors. Several drinks were forgotten or took an extended amount of time to arrive. He proceeded with taking food orders. Another male did come in to assist with this effort. The food did come out fairly quickly.   Regarding the food, I enjoyed the dip trio and the eggplant flatbread, both exceeded my expectation. If the review was simply based on the taste of the food- it would be 5 stars! Everyone noted that they enjoyed their meal. I think the prices are fair given the portion sizes that you receive.  I must also mention that the server made a number of mistakes when bringing out tabs. Not to mention, gratuity in the amount of 22% was added to each bill. For the server to not be that efficient, he made out like a bandit on gratuity!!   The last area of concern was for the cake. I  purchased two cakes for my grandmothers celebration. The waiter brought out each cake separately, then the plates, then the knife to cut the cake. I just feel that if he had assistance, everything could have been done in one run.  It's as if staff lack any sense of urgency. As I was waiting on to go boxes, I saw at least 4 staff in the back just having general conversation. I guess that's why there was a delay in just about every service area.    Based on my experience, I do not feel that this restaurant is good for large groups. Due to the fact that the food was good,I will give them another try. likely with just one or two other people."}
{"text":"While expensive. Totally worth every penny. I had the beet salad and the BBQ shrimp tacos.  Both were excellent and perfectly prepared. For dessert I had the beignets. The dessert fell short. Wasn't interesting and texture was off. Two soft. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot.  I don't recommend dinner as strongly.  The cocktails, though made deliciously fresh, are pretty pricey.  Solid business lunch meeting spot, but there are much better date night locations in uptown Charlotte.  The flat breads are great!  I'll come back"}
{"text":"Finally came by to try this place for lunch yesterday (a Wednesday). We arrived around 11:30 and the hostess was very kind and helped my friend on crutches into her seat. Our waitress was friendly and offered food recommendations. I ordered the falafel pita and my friends ordered salads. They were very pleased with their food and my pita was amazing. The pita bread was fresh and the filling was very flavorful. I'm removing one star because the fries were a little greasy and it got so packed by the end of the lunch it took a while to pay and get out. Had a pleasant experience and want to come back to try drinks and dinner. Great addition to Trade and Tryon."}
{"text":"The ambiance and location are everything .The server was very friendly, the food left me wanting. The menu is very enticing and well written, but when I got my food it was literally cold. I'm not sure if they were having a bad night in the kitchen, but no one at my table was pleased with their orders. I personally anticipated getting larger than normal portions (tapas) to share with the rest of the table, but I couldn't share cold food and other's portions were too small to share. If I do go back, I'll most likely just go for drinks."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I went here for lunch today.  We got there around 11:30, so seating was no issue (it picked up quite a bit around noon).  The inside looked really cool, but we sat on the patio.  There was some construction going on next to it, but that's out of the restaurant's control and won't be an issue soon hopefully.  We loved the patio!  We ordered 3 things and split them all because we couldn't decide what we wanted.  We got the Warm Brussel Sprout Caesar Salad, Short Rib Tacos, and the Butter Chicken.  It was more than enough food and SO good.  We loved all of it. We will definitely be back again for lunch and to try dinner and the weekend brunch as well."}
{"text":"I really love the food at Essex. I've been so many times for lunch cause I work right Uptown. The hummus is amazing! And I've had the flatbreads, pitas, and sandwiches there....never disappointed. However, every single time I'm there the service is below average. Servers don't come back to the table until you're nearly done with your meal. I had to chase someone down to refill my water (twice) and he acted like it was an inconvenience. Smh. The service isn't terrible so I'm still giving it three stars. I just think it's something to be aware of so you aren't surprised."}
{"text":"I previously wrote a review stating this place was my favorite. I have been back for the food pretty much every other week. However, with each visit, the service has declined steadily. Most recently, this Friday--our waitress (who didn't introduce herself so I have no way of knowing her name), slammed a glass of wine (second glass that my husband asked for) and walked away. Didn't say anything, ask how the food was--nothing. Just slammed it and walked away. The remainder of the time, she was pretty curt. Expected a lot more from my once favorite place in charlotte. I guess now I'll just have to succumb to take out"}
{"text":"It was NYE, a busier night than most nights. Service was slow, but understandable. The drinks we ordered were watered down. The food was good. It was unique. The Shrimp Ceviche was good, but the plating made it hard to eat out of. It kept spilling out on the table. The Butter Chicken was excellent. The Lobster tacos were decent. The Korean Pork buns were very good. Overall, it was a great atmosphere. So I'd say we'd give it an over all 3.5. Once again, the experience was based on a busy night for them."}
{"text":"I went for restaurant week after being very impressed with the selection available for the discounted price.  Great location in Uptown and a cool vibe. I felt like I was in NY! Service was great, with helpful suggestions and recommendations. They were busy due to restaurant week but they did a good job of making sure that you didn't feel rushed. All of the food that I had was spectacular. I'm not normally a fan of curry or indian food, but I was very impressed. I had the coconut curry mussels, which were delicious. A bit of spice, but a great coconut and curry taste. They also provided a giant loaf (yes, loaf) of bread which was soft and warm. Great for dipping in the broth. I also got the kale salad with apples, big fan. I'm not a huge kale person, but the salad wasn't bitter, which is sometimes uncommon with kale. Perfect portion of food with lots of great flavor. I had the chimichurri steak which was perfectly cooked medium with a great chimichurri sauce with some potatoes. Last but not least, I had the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. I was pretty stuffed, but the couple bites I had were creamy and well balanced with the chocolate and raspberry.  Overall, I was impressed. It's definitely a little more on the pricey side, but it would be a fun date night or night out. Everyone else I went with got something different and they were really happy with their choices!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I like that the small plates have a real diversity in the type of food (had gnocchi AND butter chicken) and even better - they do it all well!!! The Begnolis are simply life-changing- do not pass these up!! It seems like a totally bonus that the decor is warm, interesting, and comfortable!!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Can't speak to the table service, and have no comments on food. I am only speaking about bar service. It is really bad. They have about 20-25 bar stools and two bartenders and they can't keep up. This is not isolated, but a nightly event. It's bad.   There is an arrogance in this restaurant. They think they are good simply by their location. The management does nothing. They are more concerned about how they look, and prancing around. They don't serve customers . Charlotte is too stupid to know good service in new restaurants, but they'll figure it out. This place will die."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a perfect spot for sipping cocktails and wine with your girlfriends, or after-party, late show conversations and \"relations\"...lol...anywoo...The location is excellent. The front patio is a perfect setup for prime people watching.   The ambiance was very charming, kind of rustic, and warm. Not overly done...just enough.  I placed reservations for 10:30 on a Friday night via the OpenTable app. However, it wasn't really packed. Not really sure if this turnout is typical or if the chilly, breezy evening had anything to do with it.  Onto one of my biggest pet peeves with public establishments...questionable bathrooms!!! Essex's restrooms were clean and orderly, thank god! Public restrooms kind of gross me out...and it was a long evening...that would have been a tough, long ride home...just saying  My female waitress was very friendly and attentive. She had knowledge of the menu and was able to provide great recommendations. The bar and food orders were accurate and timely for both my company and I.  The Drinks? :  My company had a bottle of Yuengling. Not really the daring type just yet...he's getting there. However, I had ordered a Queen Scarlett. I'm glad that I did. That drink was absolutely delicious!!! The flavors blended very well together. You can feel the flavors on the front of your tongue, as well as the back. I had to take my time with this cocktail. Take a sip, look at the glass in astonishment, and take another sip. Kudos to the mixologists!!!  What I ordered: Korean BBQ Shrimp BBQ Tacos. If you are not familiar with that \"tapas style\" life, you will get your feelings hurt. But there wasn't any need to supersize these 3 delectable babies, because they were full of flavor and texture. Tapas is not meant to be scarfed down.  What my company ordered: Al Pastor Tacos w/o Guacumole. He enjoyed them as well. First time tapas eater...He still reverted back to his typical simple palate and asked for the homemade waffle fries. Another standout! And dare I say better than Chick-fil-A?! Just enough crunch, perfectly golden, fresh...  The price: The total bill came to $50.88, with tax. Little on the pricey side for some, but you're paying for the culinary experience. Personally, I found my life in the Queen Scarlett cocktail alone! To make a drink taste that good takes talent! lol  I am definitely plotting on my next Essex cocktail/food adventure. Next review, more pictures!"}
{"text":"So good. Had lunch here today great service and amazing food. Had the short rib tacos, and they were amazing. The Tortas looked incredible. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I was there in Saturday (10/8) for dinner and tapas. First off, it was very noisy and hot/stuffy inside. I started to sweat after about 30 mins. The service was good but my friend and I felt very rushed towards the end of our meal. One plus was that the hostess was able to hold our table bc we were trying to find parking--major annoyance--tip: Park at the First Citizens garage bc at some point is free--we left around 11pm and it was free and. A short walk.  We ordered the Churrasco and it was ok, the kale and Ceasar was not good, and lobster taco was messy and lobster that was tempura fried was soggy. The best thing we had was butter chicken and ironically it tasted very authentic. Safe to say most of the food we had was not that great and I would not come back. The cocktail menu was meh...some of their drinks had egg white as an ingredient and I think they should have better cocktail choices than what they include on menu.  Give it a try and see what you think but I don't plan to be back. I've had better tapas/drinks than this place. Hopefully they will change out some items and turn up the air--and side note we saw two couples leave after they sat down for 5 mins bc it was soooooo damn warm in there."}
{"text":"Lamb Lollipops were good. The sides were not good. The service was poor. Sat at bar for 5 minutes before someone addressed me. The restaurant was not packed."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. The one place in Charlotte to avoid. They charge $90 for a Macallen 18 without even pricing it on their menu and when you order they don't tell you the price, and you'd assume it wouldn't cost more than average, which is less than $40 in all the other places in Charlotte. So when you have 8 of those with friends, your bill is $800. This place is a fraud. Don't go there unless you want to get ripped off."}
{"text":"The hostess staff was welcoming and helpful. Our waitress Shatera provided very friendly and knowledgeable service. Food and ambience were excellent - especially the short-rib ravioli. Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice; once for a work dinner and once for lunch. BOTH times I was impressed with the wait staff, décor, and most importantly the delicious food. Don't leave without ordering the Warm Brussel Sprout Caesar Salad or the Butter Chicken. For lunch, the Blackened Fish Tacos were delicious. This is mostly a small plates restaurant, which I've found can be pricy, but in this case completely worth it. The menu has a mix of Mediterranean and Indian foods. Again, the Butter Chicken is incredible, (you'll want to drink the sauce). Hummus and naan are also great if you're not too adventurous. If you're still stumped, ask your server for recommendations!"}
{"text":"Once in a while, I'll make it into Uptown to check out a new restaurant.  I'm rarely disappointed, and Essex was no exception.  If I had one take-away from this restaurant, it's that the food tasted just as good as it was described on the menu.  I made a reservation earlier that day.  I didn't know how busy it would be on a Thursday, but when I got there, it was packed.  They have a pretty good-sized covered outdoor patio, perfect for people watching after work.  The inside was modern industrial.  I was lucky to get a booth with a window in the back to get a bit of a view without the chilly weather that night.  The waiter and staff was incredibly friendly.  They were attentive and provided some great food and drink recommendations.  I ended up with the Essex Gin and Tonic (YUM).  So we may have gone overboard with the food.  Everything is served tapas style, so it felt like the food just kept coming and coming and coming.  Waiter recommends about 4 dishes per person (we did 6). Trio dip was a big hit for an app, and I highly recommend the Churrasco (favorite of the night).  Four Cheese Flatbread was a really good size and was just as good as a leftover the next day.  Warning, this place can get a little loud, but if you're looking for a cool \"scene\", this is the place for you!  Great place for a group of co-workers or friends to go for just a fun dinner with great drinks if you don't mind the noise."}
{"text":"Essex has tapas style dishes, so small and medium plates. I would recommend getting 3-4 per two people. It's in a great location to people watch and sit outside. We had a ninja sushi roll, bang bang grouper, chicken skewers, and veal meatballs. Everything was very good, but the grouper was especially great!   The only draw back to this restaurant was that it was a little expensive for what you got. I'd still recommend going, but it's about $15 per plate, so with drinks it's definitely a more expensive night out."}
{"text":"I took my mom, sister and my moms husband here for Mother's Day and they absolutely loved everything about Essex. Not only is the ambiance nice and relaxed, the decor is fabulous as we enjoyed the caved style booth we were seated at. Everyone enjoyed all the entrees that was ordered, from the fish and chips, to seafood tacos, lamp lollipops and sushi rolls, everything was prepared to perfection.   The fish was nicely fried and batter, seafood tacos were served and a wonderful crunch wanton shell, the lamp was cooked perfectly packed with tons for flavor and great seasoning and last the sushi roll with crab, shrimp and tuna was beyond fresh. Essex is a sure spot to check out whenever you are uptown for an nice tapas plate and a great ambiance."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place. While I wish the bar area was larger because I don't always want to be so formal and sit at a table, I do enjoy the booths. The service is always friendly. The food has a lot to offer. I have had a few sharable items and enjoy them all. I really like the flatbread pizzas, the essex dip trio and their cheese & Charcuterie platter were great. The falafel was just ok. I found that the falafel itself (chickpeas) was over cooked. The drinks are really good too, especially their cocktails on tap!!! This tends to be  a more sophisticated, mature crowd which I can appreciate."}
{"text":"Meh. Went here for dinner after the Belk Bowl since they were still serving and wasn't packed. We ordered the calamari, tuna tartare, and the short rib ravioli. Calamari and tuna came out quick but then the short rib ravioli took about 40 min to come out. My poor husband had to sit there and watch me eat and when I tried to wait for his order my food ended up cold. The only explanation offered was that's how tapas work. Not everything comes out at once. I get that since I've been to plenty a tapas place but it doesn't take 40 min between plates. No apologies offered. Totally inexcusable. Our server looked like he didn't want to be there at all and it showed by how he handled our order. I would've let it go if the food was good but it was meh. If I lived near this place I won't be going back nor would I recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"This is a great place. The food is very good. The BBQ shrimp tacos are awesome and so is the lamb. The creme brulee is off the hook. Great up beat crowd. The bar tenders are great fun and make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Third time visiting here, and will be my last. The food is generally good (decent portioned small plates. Incredibly horrible service the last time I was here (i would give this one star, had I not had 2 other decent experiences here.)  $19 for a Manhattan? Served incorrectly and not comped - too high. Then the server said the drink tasted off because the dishwasher was broken, so we were probably drinking dish soap residue. It was served \"straight up\" but over ice, then brought back to me 30 seconds later after it was strained into a half full coupe. Ten minutes after having ordered the drink (after taking my order) the waiter introduced himself (again) and asked if he could bring me anything only to realize we had been there/his table the whole time.   Expect a wait on cocktails, usually about 10 minutes even for a cocktail on tap. Great location for Charlotte, but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"PRIME location-loved loved loved being in the middle of everything going on in the heart of Charlotte. We sat outside which was perfect for our group-but inside looked large and beautiful as well.   Ordered the Essex dip trio, kalbi beef, churrasco, and Asian style skirt steak-all of which were amazing. Small tapas style plates but flavor was on point.   Our waiter, Robert, was very friendly and very helpful. Brought us out extra bread to try with our dips, different samples of new wines to try, etc. He went above and beyond and we really enjoyed having him as our waiter."}
{"text":"We encountered this place while running away from Hurricane Irma, and meant to leave this review for a while. This is an excellent establishment with delicious food and excellent service. Will definitely return here."}
{"text":"As a \"hot and new\" restaurant in the heart of Uptown, Essex garners a solid 4 stars for: hip ambiance (4.5 stars); mediocre service (3 stars); delicious food (4.5 stars); and disappointing desserts (2.5 stars).  Overall, we really enjoyed the dining experience and due to its close proximity to where we live, we will definitely be back.  The small plates style cuisine is described as \"world food,\" meaning they have a little something from every country.    TIP:  parking can be an issue and if you want to sit on the patio,  I recommend making reservations.    Hip and trendy ambiance.  Essex is located on the corner of Tryon and Trade.  We came on a Thursday evening at 7 pm and it seemed that the seats were bountiful inside but the patio was at near capacity, which is where we sat.   The general vibe is hip and trendy with modernesque decor.   They don't have fans or heat lamps on the patios yet but they have only been open for 2 weeks.    Mediocre service.  Overall, the service was good but there is definitely room for improvement (I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt since they are still in their nascent stage).  The staff is polite, courteous, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items.  However, they can improve in the following areas: __  wait time.  After our server dropped off our drinks, we waited an additional 5-7 minutes with our menus closed before he came back to take our food order. __  spilled drink.  Our server spilled our drink on his hand, onto my BFs plate and went to wipe off his hands but did not replace the plate.  If it were my plate, I would have said something, but my BF is much more forgiving. __  water refill.  Our server left the water pitcher on our table for a few minutes (leading us to believe this was our own refill pitcher, which is frequently done in other restaurants) but came back to retrieve it and used it to refill water on other tables.  For sanitary purposes, I would prefer only the waitstaff to handle or have access to the food and drinks that I'm going to be served. __  food delivery.  After we ordered, our food arrived extremely quickly -- all of it.  Granted, this is a small plates, tapas-style restaurant and the food is meant for sharing but we did order several items and they barely fit on our small two-top table.  Plus, it made us feel rushed to consume all of it because we didn't want the food to get cold.  Satiating drinks.  Kudos to the bartender for preparing delicious drinks, leaning heavy on the alcohol side.  Delicious food.  The food is delicious, complex and although small plates, filling.  We had: ---------DELICIOUS (must try): ++  kale and apple salad.  The creamy semi-sweet vinaigrette dressing is thoroughly mixed into every bite of the salad, which had cranberries for sweetness, nuts for crunch, apples for tartness, cabbage for texture and little bits of bacon for smokiness.  The portion is pretty large, enough for 4 to sample two spoonfuls.  This was my BFs favorite item (and he doesn't usually like kale). ++  ceviche.  I LOVE ceviche and the only disappointing thing was that the portion was very small.  It had the right blend of saltiness, onions, tomatoes, fish and cilantro with the perfect amount of lemon so that every bite had the same consistency and flavor.  I didn't want to share this. ----------VERY GOOD (tasty but I'd try something different next time): ++  rock shrimp.  I would personally put this in the must try category, but my BF didn't like it as much.  The shrimp are marinated in a lemon-based, garlic, butter and herb sauce, served with yummy garlic bread.  The sauce is much more tangy than your standard shrimp scampi, with chili peppers scattered throughout.  ++  short rib ravioli.  The ravioli is freshly made (soft texture) with a sauce that reminded me of beef stew, all served on top of mashed cauliflower (which gave it a sweetness unlike mashed potatoes).  Mixing all of it together melted in your mouth; a great comfort food presented in an unconventional way. ++  lobster tacos.  The lobster was a little on the tough side but had a nice blend of avocado, cabbage garnish and semi sweet and spicy aioli, served on a corn soft shell.  I would have liked it to be served with a lime garnish to add a little kick to it, to compliment the lobster.  Disappointing desserts.  We would usually only order 1 but wanted to try 2 different items.  We had the: ++  Baked Alaska, which was supposed to have layers of mango and strawberry gelato with cake, around a mousse.  The whole thing was too rich and tasted like cake that had been sitting in the freezer for too long. ++  creme brûlée.  We love creme brûlée, but this one had fruit infused into the vanilla custard, which detracted from and added a weird flavor to it.  Essex is definitely a hot new place to try, even if at least once.  It takes traditional cuisine and successfully adds a modern, unconventional yet complex spin to it so that you embark on a culinary journey."}
{"text":"When you're by yourself.. This is a great place to grab lunch. Sit outside, watch people, sip your drinks and have a salad! Good food, great cocktails and cool ambience."}
{"text":"There are a lot of good things about Essex, but ultimately it just doesn't float my boat.  The vibe is nice, but the decor is kind of douchey, with the tattoo artwork and the artfully cropped photo of some beardy gentleman. The lighting is pleasant, and the patio is exceptional, but the furnishings seem strangely curated.   For me, Essex is typically a work lunch destination. I've found myself ordering the same thing on each of my visits -- the brussels sprout caesar salad -- because it's delicious, but it's also all I seem to be left with that's gluten free (omitting the croutons).   On my last visit, we ordered the hummus to share. I asked if we could get something GF to dip instead of pita. The hummus was brought out alone, and our server mentioned that some vegetables were on their way out for us to enjoy alongside. The hummus sat untouched in the center of the table for over ten minutes, only to have our vegetables handed over after our entrees were delivered. It made for very awkward pacing for our meal. While we were eating, our server dropped back by our table, presumably to check on our dishes, but instead shared with us that she was going on break, and that if we needed anything else we should tell her now. Another strange interaction.   I'd really like to rate Essex higher, but with so few GF options and questionable service, I have to land on three stars. But really, the caesar is delightful."}
{"text":"Really love the food here! Very diverse and flavorful. Simply can't say anything bad about this place. The only thing that I haven't been to fond of is their tortillas. Although made in house, I'm from California and I guess I just prefer traditional tortillas as opposed to tortillas that are a mixture of both corn and flour. At least that's what they told me they were. Either way if uptown  you've got to check this place out. Two must try dishes are the Butter Chicken and the Beef Sopecitos. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I visited Essex this past Saturday night, with an 8pm reservation for myself and 6 friends. Upon arrival, we were sat right away. However, after placing our drink order, we waited 35 minutes to receive them. 35 minutes to make a few gin and tonics and  2 dirty martinis. We didn't even get so much as an update from our server until we asked him what the deal was when he came around to fill our waters for the 3rd time.  There was no visit from management and all we were told was the \"bar was backed up\". The restaurant was not at full capacity and the tables around us were not sat. This was completely unacceptable and unfortunately, the second time something like this has happened. I will not be returning. Apparently I should have made a reservation for my drink to make it to the table as well."}
{"text":"Great ambience and dressier indoors and nice patio too for a bit more casual. Sat at bar area for dinner. Waitress was great super cute and attentive. The menu had everything to offer and boasts \"worldly\" eats from tacos to lamba kefta to sushi, but also your American staples too. I had a popular roll for $18 and it did not disappoint-- was loaded with good quality fresh fish and only a little rice around it. Can't wait to come back to try more stuff while I'm in town."}
{"text":"Newer hot spot in uptown. Tapas style and great for sharing. Everything I ate was fantastic and our server was wonderful. Can't wait to go back! I think we tried about 8 dishes and all of them were delicious."}
{"text":"Whatta find ! Great food and service to pair with the awesome food options. We ordered the veggie samosa as an appetizer and it was amazing. For main course we had four cheese flatbread and chicken tikka Masala with garlic bread. I was blown away by their chicken tikka, by far the best I've had in the Charlotte area. Hands down It's better than any Indian restaurant in the area. Surely going back for this. Oh yes, they validate parking in one of the nearby lots, so call ahead and ask them."}
{"text":"Lovely gastropub in the heart of uptown, and one of my favorite hangouts!    Good: - Great drinks (Ginger mimosa, Anyone?) - Great food (Korean Steak & Eggs!) - Deliciously diverse Cuisine. - Outdoor seating available. - Awesome staff (Shoutout to Gennifer!) - Full bar and BYOB with no corkage fee.  Eh: - Nothing.  Four and Half Yelps"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and setting were great, a perfect date spot. Aside from the loud group that sat next to us later on in the night. We chose to sit in the sunroom. If it were nicer outside, I'd say try the patio instead. The corner of trade and tryon is the center of the city, and finally, someone is utilizing the prime real estate.   I ordered the Italian Old Fashioned. Not exactly what a traditional old fashioned is suppose to be, a bit too sweet with a large amount of ice.   The Short Rib Ravioli was excellent, the short rib itself was seasoned and tender, it had mouth watering flavor. The only thing I would recommend changing is the mash potatoes. They tasted light and fluffy but had a hint of something unappetizing.   We asked the waiter for a dessert menu and was disappointed to hear there was no dessert for the night. That was a bit of a surprise. A few minutes later he did return and gave us a menu from the Chef himself. What saved the night was the perfect Crème brûlée.   Our waiter was uninformed with most questions, but I label that with they're in the learning phases of a new restaurant.   Overall: great location, excellent decor, and the meals are pricey but above average quality."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! We really enjoyed coming here. Wait staff was friendly and prompt, food was delicious, and everything was fast. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great vibes  Had the Brussels sprout salad - 5 stars Mushrooms -5 Stars Prime ribeye - 5 Stars Location -4 stars"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with this place. Service wasn't great and they charge more for some drinks than any place I've been to in the entire country - and I've travelled more places than I care to remember. The manager is a waste of space and doesn't seem to care about feedback. Basically just said \"it is what it is and he doesn't make the decisions\"! If you want to have a great drink and wonderful food, there is every other place in charlotte and this probably ranks at the bottom of my list now. Nobody from my entire team will ever be going back to this place. My advise to you is if you do decide to waste an evening of your life dining here, make sure you ask the price of any drink you order that is not listed on the menu. They have a tendency to make up prices that are outrageous!"}
{"text":"THE GOOD: Great location, food, and atmosphere.   THE BAD: The service could improve. I had a large party(10 ppl). We sat in front of the bar on a Saturday night. Our server seemed overwhelmed. He had to be reminded more than a few times of food orders, drinks, and extras(fork, extra wine glass, etc). It started to get a little annoying after the first couple of times. It took exactly 23 mins to get a bottle of wine I ordered. I started a timer on my phone when I placed the order because at this point the pattern of behavior(forgetfulness, slow service) was already noticed by the group. He was friendly and apologetic each time but simple requests for an extra wine glass or olives should not need reminders. I'm sure the poor service is the exception and not the rule. I'm almost certain this is the case.   MORE GOOD: The food is amazing. This is a small/medium plate atmosphere where the food is meant to be shared. We ordered different plates and passed them around so we could try a little bit of everything. Try the 4 cheese flat bread, lobster tacos, and churrasco (my favs of the night). The peppers with the calamari were a nice mix. The veal meatballs were good but cold(they sat on the table for about 10 mins because we did not receive a serving spoon and had to wait for one to be provided). I didn't like the brussel sprout salad only because I'm not a fan of the vegetable; others raved about it. The creme brulee was decent. They torch it in the kitchen, not table side. I'm not sure how I feel about that...a part of the appeal of the desert is watching it be created...(IMO).  Overall, I def.recommend and will return."}
{"text":"Went on Mother's Day and was the worst experience ever! Waiter was in a bad attitude, rude, drinks took over 30 minutes. Worst of all 2 entrees came out and then 30 minuets later 3 more entrees and oh wait another 15 minutes for the final entree. Yea like we really enjoyed eating at different times. Just absolutely horrible and will never return. Manager never came and checked on table either. Very disorganized."}
{"text":"I have been to this place couple of times. I recommend for lunch. Great lunch items. I do like the interior design of this place. The service is great! The food hasn't disappointed. I've had Shawarma pita with Grouper, and Banh MI Chicken. Both great!"}
{"text":"Great place. Good food and drinks. Can't beat the ambiance and good use of seasoning on the food. 5 stars"}
{"text":"I went here with a group girls to celebrate a birthday. The waitress didn't know the dinner menu or drink menu at all. One of the girl was allergic to imitation crab and asked her if there was any in the dish she order. The waitress replied that there was a mess up on the menu and it was real crab. Welp it was imitation crab. Yikes! The drinks take way to long. P.s. The waitress probably should have washed off the X's on her hands from the night before."}
{"text":"I wrote a review for Essex in April and gave it 5 stars but after returning to Essex last night, I couldn't believe the terrible service we received!  The food was just as good as the first night we were there...that wasn't the issue.  This time, the service was so poor it is worth mentioning in hopes that we could maybe come back to the place we loved the first time we visited.  We had a party of 8 dining.  (3 of whom had never been to Essex and likely won't be back after last night).  We sat in a private area in the back which was great as we told our server we were celebrating the engagement of my daughter and her fiancé and also a birthday of one of the people in our party.  The waitress was not helpful when asked questions about food and champagne selections (the favorite champagne she recommended was from the red wine section!) We knew that the food came out as it was prepared which was fine...we ordered a bunch of starters and then we each ordered a dinner as well.  Our waitress never came to see if all of our food was received and we couldn't find her to let her know that we had everything but one dish.  After watching her chat in the hall with another server for a bit, we finally called her over to ask where that last dinner was.  She said she would check on it and then said all the other dishes we ordered were prepped ahead of time and that one wasn't which is why it was taking so much longer.  I truly think it was more likely that she didn't put the order in!  The bang bang grouper should not take 20 minutes longer than the Prime Ribeye! We had brought a cake and she told she would get a candle so we could sing happy birthday to celebrate.  After waiting and waiting for her to return (and she did without it) we just ate the cake.  She brought our bill which was paid.  We sat around enjoying our cake for at least another 20 minutes after the bill was paid and never saw her again.  After we left the restaurant and were saying our goodbyes, she came running outside the restaurant and told us there was another $66 in charges that weren't on the bill and could we pay for them now.  We have no problem paying for what we ate, but the way this was done was rude and clearly she had no idea what she was doing after we paid the bill the first time.  She had plenty of time to catch her error.  Doing it after we left and chasing us down making us feel like we did something wrong was horrible!!!  We were two families getting together to celebrate our children.  We certainly weren't make to feel special in anyway by Essex or our waitress!  This was a favorite restaurant of the engaged couple and we went there to have a great night.  The food was on point but the service was the worst I have had in a very very long time!  There are lots of great food options in Charlotte.  We will definitely eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been to Essex twice for lunch. First time I had the Korean BBQ shrimp tacos.  I was expecting a deep rich sauce with a bit of sweet heat, but instead it was orange and sweet yet still tasty, just not what I expected.  Next visit I got the bahn mi chicken sandwich which was pretty good,  but what really impressed me was the hummus and warm bread. ..it was delicious, we went through 2 orders of it.  Next I'll have to try dinner."}
{"text":"Two subsequent visits (not my choice, as you can imagine) have not helped improve my take on this place.  Came on a Sunday evening for light fare.  Our cheese board was all decked out.  With a dead fly.  Yum!  And, shocker, there was a hullabaloo between the hostess and the waitress who showed up late and had to take her waitressing duties back from the hostess who had started to care for us.  Workplace drama, please stay away from the customers.  Especially on a casual Sunday!   Came for a work lunch.  Came EARLY for a work lunch.  Still took an hour an a half to get in and out.  Started off with the wonderful experience of having a waitress stare straight over my shoulder for three minutes while I looked her in the face as she refused to even acknowledge my presence or say something like, \"The hostess will be right with you.\"  The waiter standing right beside her kept looking back and forth between us trying to figure out what was going on, but he didn't say anything either.  Is this what passes for customer service these days?  I finally did the warm Brussels sprouts Caesar salad that Charlotte raves about.  It was nothing special.  Another in my party had it as well and concluded the same.  It was fine, just... not really worth yelping about except to dispel the myth of being at all deserving of hype.    Three strikes, Essex; you and I are through.  I won't be back for brunch, I won't be back for casual drinks or light afternoon/evening fare, and I won't be back for work lunches.  I am going to be that annoying person that makes everyone else accommodate them and change plans, just to avoid you.  Consider us broken up."}
{"text":"Amazing experience.  The wife and I shared the warm Brussels sprout salad, the margarita flatbread and the Churrasco.  All three were fantastic.  It was the perfect amount of food for 2 people.   Really cool place and we had an excellent server, Chad.  I would definitely recommend this place.    Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. They have an incredible menu which spans across many different international cuisines. The butter chicken and the deserts are must haves!"}
{"text":"Stopped in a full hour before closing time and was told by a dismissive hostess that the kitchen had closed. Not a great impression for out-of-towners. I recommend they update their website/Yelp profile appropriately."}
{"text":"Essex is a tapas style restaurant that has an incredible menu and gorgeous bar. I've tried the Lamb Sliders when they first opened then last night I tried their Coconut Curry Mussels. It was SO delicious that everyone wanted to eat all of my remaining sauce with the naan bread they give you.   It was a great night but, unfortunately, we didn't get the best service. Two Shrimp & Grits needed to go out our table but the server decided one out of the two Shrimp & Grits plates he was holding was going to another table. Our server apologized but she didn't do much about it. We were all done eating our plates when the last Shrimp & Grits finally got to our table. I believe the service could've been way better at Essex but I am willing to give it another chance since their food was so incredible."}
{"text":"Initially I gave this 5 stars. After coming here quite a few times it has gradually gone downhill. The food is generally still good. However the quality and presentation has been lacking given the great experience I had the first few weeks. Also the portion sizes have reduced while the prices have increased. I hope they can get back on track."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot!!! The plates are perfect and the service was awesome! Food. Was. Really. REALLY. Good!! I can't wait to come back! It's a Monday night (7 PM), and the energy is great. The scenery, location and vibe is just perfect"}
{"text":"I was taken here while in a business trip and I was satisfied with the food and service!  The service was great. The server we had was friendly and went over the menu with me.  The food was delicious! I didn't leave feeling hungry .  The atmosphere is laid back and comfortable!"}
{"text":"Nice British-themed restaurant uptown on corner of Omni hotel.  The Gambas Al Ajillo was good with rock shrimp sautéed in olive olive with naan bread in shape of an overdose bread stick.  TVs over the bar allowed me to watch sports.  Popular place.  May require reservation if busy night"}
{"text":"A really excellent addition to uptown. Not only do you get a fantastic patio with prime people watching, you get an incredibly accessible menu and cocktails.   The food and drinks are very reasonably priced and are both very good. The short rib ravioli was out of this world.   The cocktails COULD be better but I'll attribute that to growing pains as all the bartenders learn to make everything.   The vibe inside is exactly what Charlotte needs move of. Relaxed yet modern. Upscale yet approachable. The decor is super unique.   Just a great addition to uptown and a must try for lunch or dinner or even late night."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Went for brunch on a Saturday, no wait. Started to get busy around 1 as I was leaving. Reasonable prices for the servings they give. You will definitely get full. Servers were polite, friendly, and personable. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Food and staff was great I will be back again the bartender and host was very friendly. The shrimp & grits was amazing loved loved the ceviche  it was so freaking good. You guys rock tell the cooks keep kicking ass and sending each dish out with love and freshness and bold flavors."}
{"text":"I went to Essex after seeing a musical show for a late dinner. Needless to say i was totally impressed with their vegetarian options. Granted most of them were appetizers but after ordering a few I was full! Their service was awesome as well.  Kim V did a great job in keeping the order as requested.  I can't have parmesan cheese since it contains animal rennet and its not suitable for vegetarians. Luckily their stuffed mushrooms arent pre-made so I was able to have the mushrooms without parmesan cheese. The first order came out with the cheese but she sent it back to have it remade without it. I couldn't have asked for a better waitress! I look forward to coming back to enjoy Essex again."}
{"text":"Nice decor, location is great, portions are huge, the butter chicken is fantastic, everything else was just meh, the sliders, the lobster tacos (avoid), kale salad (no), calamari (no), cocktails are good."}
{"text":"Today, apparently, a good friend of mine found a hair in her meal.  When she brought this up to management, they told her something to the effect of \"No one in the kitchen has hair like this - and it looks like your friend's.\"  Really?  First of all, I know the character of my friend and they would never do something so shady.  Secondly, is this really the way an \"upscale\" restaurant should handle this type of situation?  No.  The proper way is to say you're sorry, take the food back, get another hairless plate and comp it and some drinks.  I had enjoyed Essex in the past, but can assure you I won't be back and will recommend that anyone I know avoids this place in the future."}
{"text":"We have had a bit of a mixed experience with Essex. We went one weekend for their lunch and had the delicious butter chicken (if you do go I highly recommend it!) so we went back to try their dinner and left disappointed. The first problem we ran into was waiting over 20 minutes past our reservation time, which is one of my biggest peeves. A well run restaurant shouldn't make patrons with a reservation try to squeeze in at a full bar to chit chat and try to kill time. It was pretty crowded to stand with coats in hand trying not to spill on the people passing through.  After we were seated we were in a somewhat awkward spot along the hallway to the bathroom. Across from the wine wall which was nice décor but the constant stream of people and tight quarters to the table behind us was not the romantic date night atmosphere we had anticipated.  Food - we got the butter chicken again. Absolutely delicious a second time around. I love the huge loafs of naan that it comes with.  Short rib ravioli was also a win though it came in a smaller portion than I had anticipated. That was okay though because our next dish, the gambas al ajillo, was bigger (and a touch tarter) than I thought it would be. We also ordered the sashimi tacos which were spicy but overall I enjoyed them. We also got a random order of tacos left on our table, and sent them back after realizing they weren't the right tacos. Then after we had paid someone tried to drop off more sashimi tacos at our table.  I totally debated eating those but didn't want to deprive the person who ordered them so sent them back as well.  Drinks - the essex smash I had and the bacon old fashioned my boyfriend had were both delicious. Toward the end of dinner I was reviewing the drink menu and ordered a daiquiri since I hadn't had one in ages and thought it could double as dessert. At first the waitress said they didn't sell daiquiris then remember they have a new cocktail tap machine. The daiquiri on the rocks that came out was quite a disappointment.  None of the food was disappointing but the whole disorganized night, even though they opened months before, puts this in my lunch restaurants list rather than a tapas dinner or date night place."}
{"text":"Four stars for the food, decor, and atmosphere at dinner. As a vegetarian, I'm not generally a huge fan of tapas style as it tends to be very meat heavy, and I don't particularly like splitting a large bill when I've had a salad and a side dish. Essex has plenty of options though; I particularly liked the gnocchi and the brussels sprout caesar. The fried cauliflower was pretty good, but too much curry for my taste (I would prefer a sweet & sour) and was missing the candied pecans. The brussels sprouts dish was also missing the home made croutons. The dip trio was also good, but it was a little odd to eat guacamole on a buttery baguette, and the menu did say that it was to be served with naan bread. The short rib ravioli seemed to be a hit. On the downside, a lot of the dishes, as well as the cocktails, are overpriced. The zucchini chips sound good, but am I really going to pay $14 for a small plate of fried zucchini? Or $12 for a side of hummus? The cocktails were fairly tasty, but also fairly weak. And at $14, I expect a little more. The ingredients currently on offer are a little pedestrian. The cocktail list displayed online is not reflective of what they are currently making; I would be much more interested in the old menu."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional and Kevin made us feel at home. This place is a fantastic spot to start your night off. Even with a larger then typical portioned  tapas menu, we couldn't help but ordering everything. Not one dish disappointed the large party we had. Well done, Essex! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Boss treated us to lunch here. Nice place but the service was slow especially for being uptown and during the lunch rush. They should have been more prepared. Our waitress went missing for awhile. Boss man had to go find someone to get our check. I had the chicken Brie L'T and it was delicious. I got the sweet potato for my side but it was cold when I got it. Since the service was slow, I opted to not get new sweet potato because it would have taken long to get it. My friend had the Butter chicken flatbread but she didn't really like it because it had curry in it which was not in the description on the menu. Definitely should be on there since Curry is a strong flavor and some don't like it."}
{"text":"I planned a work Christmas lunch at Essex about a month in advance.  We had a party of 10.    We arrived and were seated immediately.  Our waiter brought out waters and recommended some different items on the menu.  After ordering we waited a while for our food.  For some reason all of the entree salads were brought out but no one else's meals were brought out.  This was REALLLLLYYYYYY awkward for a work lunch because those of us with our entree salads waited to eat.  I had to talk to the hostess to find our waiter to bring out the rest of our food .  It sucked and was really embarrassing because I set up the reservations and picked the place.   Someone came to our table and said \"sorry we split your ticket up and our kitchen is backed up.\"  They didn't offer any appetizers for those waiting forever for their food.    The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because my Brussel sprout Caesar salad was delicious even after sitting for 15 minutes waiting for everyone else to get their food."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out! Sat at the bar and had great service, even though the bartender was very busy with service tickets. It's beautiful and a great spot for a date night.   Started with the Essex dip trio. My favorite was the yogurt dip. The garlic naan was warm and delicious. Not embarrassed to say we got another round.   My favorite thing was the warm brussel sprout caesar. Melt in your mouth good. We had the short rib ravioli as well. That was my boyfriend's favorite.   He had a couple of cocktails, the Essex smash. Those were tasty.   Definitely want to try out the lunch menu, seems like a great deal!"}
{"text":"Nice place ! Great food ! Loved to lam hamburger !  We order 4 of this dishes ! I will most def come back here again ! The staff was amazing too"}
{"text":"My husband always wanted to try this place because he loved the patio area. We came on Saturday and the patio was full, but the inside atmosphere was great, lots of energy. Neither of us had ever been to a place that had the small/medium plates so I was concerned we wouldn't have enough to eat. We had the butter chicken, lobster tacos and fried calamari and they were awesome! We were pleasantly satisfied without being stuffed and miserable. Our waiter was very attentive and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am beyond shocked that this place has 4 stars on Yelp. What is everyone smoking? I came to CLT for the weekend and found this place via Eater. I was hoping to be impressed; however, I was disturbed. I went with a group of 8 (6 of whom live in CLT). The service was horrible. Our waitress was rude and inconsiderate. Additionally, she forgot 3 people's drink orders and didn't deliver a ketchup when asked twice. When I ordered my drink and kindly asked and instructed her to please squeeze a lemon into it but throw the rind away, she acted as though I requested that she recite the Girl Scout Pledge on one foot with a blind fold on. Furthermore, the portions were inconsistent. A group of 12 could've shared the brioche French toast, yet the fish tacos I ordered would barely nourish a 6 month old. In terms of the drinks, I'd like to thank all the bartenders there who appear to be my new AA sponsors. Tighten up and give us a little more fuel. You guys gotta iron out the details. Regardless, the waffle fries were lovely.  P.S- Fix the plating of the Heuvos Rancheros. The black bean purée resembles what my hardwood floor looks like the morning after I drunkenly feed my lab a burrito."}
{"text":"I have been to Essex twice now and let me tell you... this place is amazing! We came on a Friday and it was packkkked. We had made a reservation and got our table right away. The service was superb and the food was even better! This is definitely a place you come to share your food with everyone so you can try it all. Everything is amazing. I had a great glass of Chardonnay and the the \"Harvest Moon\" I believe it was called( a bourbon cider drink)... yum! We ate things like carpaccio, tuna tacos, dip trio, skirt steak, mussels... all to die for. Anything with short rib in it was amazing! Per usual we scarfed the food down so fast I couldn't get a picture.   The only down side was the mojito. We had just had one from BLT down the street and this one couldn't compare.   I will continue recommending this place though! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Prime location! This place is on trade and tryon and perfect for a group lunch or dinner. It's easy to get reservations and the ambience is classy, modern, but still casual.   Best part about this place is their price points on food. Very affordable given the atmosphere and location. I ordered the butter chicken and it was delicious! Paired perfectly with the warm bread. The chicken was juicy and the sauce was creamy and balanced with the right amount of spices to it."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great spot. Walked here from work for a client lunch. Perfect entertaining spot. We started with the hummus and loved that.   For lunch I was told the Indian Butter chicken was awesome. I ordered that. It comes with a piece of Naan bread shaped (and almost the size of) a baseball bat! So great. The dish is just a large helping of chicken in sauce. Perfect lunch size. And the sauce...well...I used the entire baseball bat of naan and a couple of extra pita slices to mop up all of the sauce. Many at the table got the Brussells Sprout salad and we thrilled with their choice. Looked awesome."}
{"text":"When my three tapas were cleared, I only wanted more. Everything was delicious, the ambience is perfect and it's in a great location. It's the Soul Gastrolounge of Uptown. Can't recommend enough."}
{"text":"Laid back atmosphere. High chairs available. Everything we had was delicious. Torta, shwarma both amaze. Service was friendly and fast. It was a little chilly in the restaurant though and the water ij the bathroom was freeezing but to be fair it was 30 degrees outside so i'll let it slide. I understand y'all southerners aren't prepared for \"cold\" weather. Hahah."}
{"text":"My sister and I went there for brunch today. We had a really great time. Brent was our server and he couldn't be more wonderful. He offered a lot of really great suggestions and was really helpful. My sister had the breakfast sandwich while I had the Huevos Rancheros Benedict. It was absolutely delicious. Both plates came  with a side of home fries that were also  delicious.  We sat where we had a great vantage point of all the things going on around Uptown. It's a great place to go just to hang out with friends or for a date."}
{"text":"I was so sad I had to give this place two stars. I was so excited to finally try this place out because all my friends had been raving about the service and the amazing food, but unfortunately I had an awful experience. My group decides to arrive for a late brunch on Sunday with a rather big group, so because of it being a big group I didn't expect excellent service. Though we had a big group there was no reason for the type of service I received, we all order our food and it all comes out sporadically of course because we are in a big group. so I think nothing of it for my food to be taking so long. After 2 hours of being there though, I have had my limit of waiting because everyone else has gotten their food except for two other friends and I. The server April finally processed to walk up to the table and goes \"Oh who ordered the Bahn Mi chicken, I forgot to tell you we don't make that item anymore what can we get you?\"Oh may I add that I had ordered a warm Brussel sprout Cesar salad that still didn't come out either. She proceeds to give me the dinner menu now so that I could reorder because they don't have the brunch menu available anymore and tells me to order something that's equal amount to what I had ordered before. I finally get my meal and everything was delicious I got the beef short rib sliders and the warm Brussel sprouts Cesar salad with sweet potato waffle fries and they all were amazing. But the service overall was horrible. Maybe it was the size of my group or waitress i don't know but my experience was poor.  Oh and to add to my frustration while I was there, there was no heat in the building when it was 20 degrees outside that day.   I may give this place one more try just because the food was amazing despite the service."}
{"text":"Amazing shareable plates. Brussels spouts, Tuna poke tacos, Mediterranean eggplant flatbread, and of course the chocolate mousse"}
{"text":"Nice vibe. Great seafood!! Perfect place to hang out with friends since it is located at the heart of the uptown area."}
{"text":"I've been to Essex several times by now, and here's my take on this hot spot.  I'll start by saying I've always liked their spacious layout with cool, contemporary ambience.  They offer a variety of tables, from booths and stand-alones, to several long tables...so it's good for dates, as well as bigger group outings.  However, prepare to repeat yourself if you're dining with a group on a weekend night...as it tends to get very busy...and very loud.  Also, given that it's an uptown restaurant, parking is a bit pesky...and you should prepare to walk at least one block, on the most part.  In the past, they validated your parking ticket if you chose Autopark 2 blocks away, but no longer.  All that aside, I've always been impressed with their eclectic menu of fusion-style foods.  Since most plates are tapas-style, with smaller portions, I'd recommend ordering 2 plates per person.  On my latest occasion, I tried their Short Rib Ravioli and Fried Cauliflower.  Both were unusual chef-inspired creations and beautifully presented, so extra points right there...and as expected, delicious!  By now, I've tried a good variety of plates...and so far, I haven't been disappointed.  I especially enjoyed their Shrimp & Grits, Kalbi Beef Steam Buns and BBQ Shrimp Tacos, but most items on the menu are unique, and worth trying.  If you enjoy taking pictures of your foods, you won't be disappointed either.  Just know that your bill will most definitely rack up, given that you may be ordering more than 1 plate per person, with approximately $14-$19 per plate.  Despite a few possible pesky factors (mostly the noise level on weekend nights), I've always found the dining experience here to be highly rewarding...and I will most likely return again!"}
{"text":"Looking for a fun relaxed yet upscale/trendy place to eat delicious food that looks beautiful and is brought to you by competent and friendly servers? Then you can stop, because you found it. ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"Food was decent and location is fantastic in the very center of the city...great patio.  A little overpriced for the quality/quantity of the food but I guess you're paying for the location as well.  The drink prices are ridiculous...seriously way overpriced.  $16 for a Hendrix gin and tonic is not appropriate.  The first one was completely flat as well but server took care of it (2nd one was average).  Maybe try this place for lunch or if you're planning on a fun night on the town with lots of money to spend."}
{"text":"The Caesar chicken Brussel sprout is amazing! The flatbreads are good too, light beer selection though. Only downfall."}
{"text":"My daughter and I chose to go because it was labeled \"A Hot Spot\" on OpenTable. We were mostly unimpressed. The decor was modern-industrial. We sat in a comfortable leather and houndstooth booth, which wrapped around us and made it feel like we had some privacy, which we liked. The butcher-block table was impressive. The music was too loud and not necessarily good. We read reviews on Yelp and decided to order Butter Chicken as it was raved about on the app. There was nothing special about it. We also ordered the Hummus, which was delicious with the addition of Harissa which added flavor. The naan breadsticks were fresh out of the oven and a highlight. The Huevos Ranchos were good with the addition of homemade corn tortillas, a signature of the restaurant. There was not a vegan option which is unusual. We wanted dessert, but Saturday at lunch is not dessert time for them and most people probably don't eat dessert then anyways, but we were still bummed a little. The service was friendly but slow even though it wasn't crowded. They left our dirty dishes on the table for an inordinate amount of time, which is one of my pet peeves. It was pricy- lunch being $55 for 2 people and the Health department rating is a 93.5- yuck. Not a place for a foodie, but good location. We paid for the location and decor, not the food. A Hot Spot can be hit or miss and this was a miss for us."}
{"text":"I did a taste testing at Essex last night! Every dish was A-mazing!  Such a wide variety of food from Lamp Chops, Butter Chicken, Variety of Pizza's, Meat Balls, Scallops, Mediterranean Trio, and the list goes on!    I was very impressed.  The decor made a really cozy warm feeling in there as well."}
{"text":"I've been to Essex twice now, and really enjoyed both experiences.  The first time, I went with a group of ladies from my book club for our holiday dinner.  The second, my husband and I went during Restaurant Week.  I've tried many of their dishes and some are absolutely repeatable.  Let me try to summarize the highlights -   Favorites * Butter chicken - Their chicken is tender, and the sauce is rich and delicious.  Plus, the bread they serve with it is AMAZING. * Warm brussel sprout caesar salad - Gosh, this salad is good!  I daresay it's my favorite version of a caesar salad EVER. * Asian style skirt steak - Our server recommended this, and I'm glad we tried it!  I don't typically like steak, but this preparation was tasty, and it melted in your mouth.     Other impressions   * Gambas Al Ajillo - This dish is served with plenty of rock shrimp.  The sauce was good, but in comparison to the skirt steak and butter chicken, I'd probably forgo this the next time.  Psst - it's also served with their delicious bread. * Lobster tacos - This was my biggest (really, the ONLY)  disappointment.  The tacos needed more sauce, and the lobster was overcooked.   * Bang Bang Grouper - This was similar to Bonefish's version.  My husband liked this better than me.  I just found it a bit too saucy for my liking. * Kale and Apple Salad - Normally, this would be my go-to salad.  But after having the brussel caesar, I'd always choose the latter over this one. * Essex dip trio and Mediterranean dip trio - Both were good, and perfect for sharing.  I do want to try the tuna poke tacos and shrimp and grits on our next visit.  It's going to be so hard determining which of our favorites to forgo though!  I did find the drink menu to be a bit lacking.  I prefer martinis and cocktails with vodka, and there weren't many options.  The drinks I tried on both occasions (I honestly cannot remember them) were just ok.  Service was great on both occasions.  Especially considering we had a big table during one of the visits.  In terms of atmosphere, Essex has many areas for seating, but the restaurant is both lively and loud.  Keep this in mind if you are looking to have an intimate conversation.    The food and service were so good that  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here and 'd it! It's tapas but you can order three things shared between two people and feel full. The food was excellent! I think they prepare fresh on site. We enjoyed fish and chips, meatballs and the tacos. Save room for dessert! Excellent !   Great service. Attentive and friendly staff. Nice ambiance. Will go back here again for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say!  The atmosphere is nice and laid back and the service was excellent. We had. I idea what was on the menu and  were pleasantly surprised by what we ordered - shirt steak with puréed parsnips, flat bread with steak and the most delicious calamari in tomato sauce - that was the best and most tender calamari I had since moving south. Definitely worth visiting if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place a lot. We tried three different plates- the mussels, buttered chicken and the gnocchi and everything was delicious. Probably wouldn't do the gnocchi again, though it was still good. BUT. The mussels and chicken were AMAZING. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Very good things to say about Essex!  Location is prime and perfect for those working in uptown and need a new place to grab lunch! I would also say this place could Be an option for after work drinks with coworkers!! Can't wait to give that a try!  But for now I only went for lunch.  Arrived at 12:00, place was not too terribly busy and was able to score a table on the cool patio.  Ordered the fish tacos that came with a side Greek salad or sweet potato fries and chose the Greek salad.  Both were excellent and the right amount of food! Service was friendly and inviting, decor was beautiful and the atmosphere was just perfect.  Got the bill and spent a whopping $11.39.  I couldn't believe it.  For the quality and the nice portion size it's a steal!! I can't remember the last time I received  good quality food for less than $20.    Looking forward to the dinner experience whenever I make the trek into uptown at night.  ONEEEEE tiny design dislike.  Whoever thought that placing black toilets in the woman's bathroom was chic or a good idea...it was not.  Black toilets are never ok IMHO. *shudders* But good job on the round teal mirrors! *thumbs up*"}
{"text":"Overall really enjoyed this place. Little expensive but for tapas the portions were fairly larger than most places. Were seated on time and server was super nice and attentive. Our favorites were the butter chicken and samosas! Did an awesome job on the curry side. The cauliflower was good but needed more sauce as the actual pieces didn't have much flavor. The short rib ravioli was pretty good and could be a small meal in itself. We ordered the pork buns but they didn't come out in steamed buns like the menu said, the server was nice and took them back since it's not what we were looking for. Also got the steak with the chimi. A few others got the mussels and the Brussels which they loved but I did not try. Overall i would come back but probably order less! 3 max 4 are needed for a couple."}
{"text":"I found the staff to be delightful and warm, food was unique and delicious, and the drinks were out of this world!  I look forward to returning doing a future visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"What a neat place! We had the best impromptu date night at Essex and am so glad we tried it out. With the tapas style dishes we were able to try many different items and it was delicious. We did the Mediterranean sauce plate with the naan which was very good. I was disappointed with the amount of naan compared to the sauces and then having to pay an extra $2 for each additional serving. We also had a dish from each of the additional sections of the menu and everything was tasty.   The wine selection is very good and they have decent wines that are not excruciatingly marked up. We did not ask but were put in a booth off to the side of the restaurant and it was the perfect spot for a date night. I highly recommend asking for a spot by the window or a booth.   We saw a small party of 8 celebrating an engagement at the table next to us and it seemed like the perfect spot for such an occasion. I would suggest this place for birthday dinners (with relatively small parties) or even small celebrations. I am definitely looking forward to the next time we go back."}
{"text":"We came here for dessert and a drink before a concert. The hostess was very nice and got us a lovely seat outside right away. She came back about 5 minutes later to give us water and apologize for our waiter having not helped us yet, as he was at the bar getting drinks. When he came to take our order he was friendly and funny. I got the lemon molten cake and he got a shot of Maker's Mark. The cake was delicious, although it was way smaller than I expected. Not really shareable, so good thing I was eating it alone! The bill for the two things was $26. Pricey place, but good food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were pretty excited to eat here. It's definitely a trendy little place. It's so loud both inside and outside. You could see couples on dates. We had a baby with us who we bring to Disney and everywhere so the noise level didn't bother him but we could barely hear each other speak. In terms of value, the prices for what you receive aren't really that great. We eat everywhere and do not care for prices but the portions were small. We understand the tapas and small plates concept. The surf and turf sushi was the highlight of the meal. Short rib ravioli was just ok. Under seasoned and just average in terms of flavor. We also had the stuffed mushrooms. They were unnecessarily fried which it doesn't mention on the menu. A lot of people around us were enjoying the naan bread with the spreads so we probably should have tried that. The service was great. I had a great passion fruit vodka cocktail. We probably wouldn't go back with so many other better places we have tried. Worth going to once though! Maybe you'll find a favorite on the menu that is jam packed with items from across the globe."}
{"text":"The Tuna tacos are fantastic! Nice grade of tuna. The service was on point, my server's name was  Antonette. She was very attentive and very knowledgable of the food and drinks. Will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"They call it Tapas but the servings seem larger than that, yet smaller the a full meal. The menu is varied with a lot of interesting blends like Bang bang grouper . Decent wine list and prices are reasonable. Service was efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, I really do, but after two visits, I just can't.   First, I get that it's a \"tapas\" place, but there is zero consistency on what food comes out when. Some hot food comes out ASAP, but cold items take an obscene amount of time. I get it, things are made to order, but there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason. Additionally, both times I have gone, the couple with us have received all their ordered items (usually 2 or 3) before we have received any of our food items. Both times, I feel like our server used the \"tapas\" concept as an excuse.   Secondly, the food itself is inconsistent. The first visit, we were given three lamb sliders (this was in January). When we returned this past weekend, there were only 2, and they were much more spicy than the last time. Same with the crispy stuffed olives. First time, they were perfectly fried and there had to be 8 or more olives. This time, there were 5, and they were so fried and hard that I could have used them to break a window.   Finally, this last visit, I was overly perturbed by a situation that occurred. Our server shared with us a special that sounded delicious, and we ordered it. When it arrived, she placed it on the table and we looked at it. The looks on our faces prompted her to say, \"oh did I forget to say the meat was raw?\", to which we replied yes. I further shared that myself and the other girl at the table were both pregnant, so we can't eat anything raw, and if she would have told us, we wouldn't have ordered the $19 special. Our servers response was \"just try it, I didn't know it was raw when we sampled it but I liked it\" and then walked away. So we were then stuck with a dish that we couldn't eat because of her lack of explaination (and it wasn't that we didn't want to eat it, but raw meat falls under the no category when your pregnant). I wanted to bring this to a managers attention, but after waiting for our food for as long as we had, we had very little time before our show began. Needless to say, this was really the third strike on two sub-par meals at this place."}
{"text":"Pros: Great venue Awesome cocktail menu AMAZING food Great staff   Cons: No parking  Pricy $$$  This was great for a special occasion. It's also close to a lot of things so you can go as a dinner before a show or sporting event. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Nah, too much hype. No follow thru. If you're young and just wanna drink, bar is awesome. Food is ok, some not ok. Shrimp and lobster on the tacos taste like they are one and the same and I actually had to ask if they brought me the wrong taco. The shrimp is small, probably a 21/25 and taste iodiny. Not good.  Lobster Tacos? You sure it was lobster?? Asian Chicken Salad poses as an interesting entree and turns out to be no more that a chicken salad lunch special.   The Flatbread was good, but I can make it at home. Falafel, really?? Cheese board, can't mess that up. . Baked Alaska was too frozen. The Beignolis were the best thing there.  Overall, the place is pretty, cool date ambience, but the food is overpriced and just average. If you think the food is really good, you have no taste at all. I'm heading back to the Soul Gastrolounge,"}
{"text":"I brought my mom here for her mothers day brunch along with my brother and his family. We all really loved the mixture of Greek and American foods for the buffet. It was reasonably priced compared to other mothers day brunches in Charlotte. The French toast was my favorite and my brother really liked it as well. My brother and I also really really liked the butter chicken it reminded me of the Indian chicken masala. My mom fell in love with the cheese selections they provided as well as the Macrons.  The buffet was full of food the grits were amazing I mean we really couldn't complain it was a great Sunday and the day was beautiful."}
{"text":"Tapas restaurant with a lot of variety in their menu. My friend and I had the following:   Spicy poke tuna: 4/5. This kind of served as the \"appetizer\" since it was pretty light. Was probably my favorite of the four tapas because all of the flavors worked well together and there was a fair amount of tuna.  Bang bang grouper: 3.5/5. This was interesting. I wasn't sure what to expect, even though I was sure I had tried grouper before. I enjoyed it in this dish, especially the way it was prepared (slightly crispy).  Potato gnocchi: 3/5. This was my least favorite. The flavor was just okay and I kind of got sick of the gnocchi after a few bites.   Fried cauliflower: 4/5. This came with a nice curry sauce and had lots of Indian spices, which (for me) is always a plus.   Overall, just a good meal. Nothing extraordinary, but no regrets in choosing to dine here.   Taste | 3.5 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 4 Service | 3 OVERALL | 3.5-4"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Saturday at noon and it was fairly dead. But it was busy by the time we left. I got the lamb burger and my date got a meat lovers flat bread. Everything was tasty, but our order got a bit mixed up and my date had to reorder because the initial choice wasn't available. Really love the decor though. And the Bloody Mary bar sounded and looked amazing."}
{"text":"Small plates, great tasting food, good ambience.  The bang bang grouper was just the right flavor, the baguette they served was fresh and soft.  For dessert try the baked alaska - perfect blend of strawberry and mago gelato with vanilla cake.  The wait time was short, waiter was very friendly. Would definitely recommend this place! 5 stars overall."}
{"text":"In two words: just okay.   Some girl friends and I met here. We were able to find street parking pretty easy- but you know that is never a guarantee in uptown. We sat on the patio and started with drinks. Everyone seemed to like their drinks. Our server, Chris, was friendly and cool. Two of us decided to split three different items: Caesar brussel sprouts (I really liked this), lobster tacos (decent), and gambas al ajillo (the flavor, while a little too lemony, was good but the shrimp were tiny, popcorn shrimp sized).   I do feel like it was too expensive so for that and the mostly just okay food, I give this place three stars. Not terrible. Not stellar."}
{"text":"Came here for a girls night during restaurant week and it was awesome! Essex has one of the best deals for restaurant week in charlotte: soup or salad, two small plates and a dessert for $35. I started with the Greek salad which was pretty standard but good, and for my small plates I had the butter chicken and the pork buns.   The butter chicken had very good flavor and the \"naan\" breadstick was amazing! The chicken was a little drier than I would like but the sauce made up for it. The pork buns were also good with very thick cut pork belly and pickled vegetables, but I wasn't overly impressed with the actual buns (they were definitely not homemade, probably purchase frozen). The tiramisu was also very good! The perfect way to finish the meal. Some other favorites in the group were the poke tacos, bang bang grouper and the short rib ravioli.   Essex was a great choice for girls night and is probably even better when it's not restaurant week!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. We had the brussel sprouts salad, the bang bang grouper, the coconut curry mussels, and the churrassco. My husband declared he would get the bang bang grouper on every visit from now on. This is a tapas place though, so most dishes are pretty small. (The butter chicken was a larger portion from seeing other people order it, and the mussels were a larger portion too.) The drinks were good too - we had the Gingerberry (my favorite), the Essex Mule (husband's favorite), the Harvest Moon (skip this one), and the Bananas Foster (ok but not worth getting again). Our waitress was friendly and attentive...till the end when she went MIA a few times. This is definitely not a place to go if you are in a rush - we allowed for 2  1/2 hours with our reservation time before our show that night at Blumenthal, and we made it about 15 minutes before it started. At least 20 minutes of our time at Essex though was waiting on the bill, and then waiting for her to return after payment had been given. The biggest disappointment was actually the lack of dessert options - there were only two because of \"short staffing\"?? (Which I took to mean they no longer have a dessert/pastry chef?) The options were bland - chocolate mousse and a tiny strawberry cheesecake. We saw other people order them, and neither looked worth it. To that end, it's worth noting that their website is not up to date. The cocktails had many different and some missing, and of course the desserts are no longer accurate.   As for ambiance, it would be nice if something could be done about the noise-level inside. We were literally shouting over the table to hear each other the entire time we were there. And the dress code turned out to be much more relaxed than indicated on the website - jeans and a nicer top seemed the average attire for Saturday night.  All said and done, we had a good experience, and we both left agreeing that we would return."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner. Absolutely loved it. It's a small plates restaurant so pro tip is to order 2 entrees and share with everyone at the table.  I definitely want to come back for brunch because the music was awesome and I want to enjoy the patio seating but when the humidity isn't so intense lol.  Short Rib Ravioli is sooo yum probably by favorite   Tip: Validated parking is available at the Auto Park on Church Street across of Ink N Ivy. *BEWARE* ladies if you're wearing heels just catch a pedal cab, you'll thank me later"}
{"text":"I ordered the falafels, which cost $13 (at dinner time). Im happy to pay for upscale food, but the plate i received was not upscale.   Ordinarily I visit La Shish Kebab or Kebab Je Rotisserie for authentic lebonese falafel. At both establishments I pay $6-$7 for a falafel that is wrapped in pita and features lots of veg. At Essex, I received 6 half-dollar sized falafel balls on a plate of tahini/hummus, with some chopped tomatoes and onions. It was tasty, but ridiculously overpriced. At most they should charge $6...or since they are charging $13, at least provide a small salad with the teeny portion of falafel. It tasted meh, compared to Le Shish or Kebab Je.   Also, the server seemed a) annoyed we were there b) cleaned our table before we left (most places wait until you leave c) she was bothered by our order which was not excessive.   The service left a lot to be desired, as well as the food. Many other places in Uptown that are fine dining, good quality & service."}
{"text":"Sitting in here now and cannot believe how incredibly inattentive this bartender is. In with one other female and there are two female bartenders-neither of whom greeted us when we came in.  I had to just start talking to one's Attention to ask for drink menus.  Finally got served and had to ask every time to be refilled from the bottle we bought.  Counted about 6 other people sitting at the bar with us and no one in the restaurant so certainly not a booming place at this time.  Can't guarantee I'll ever return here"}
{"text":"A friend invited me here for her birthday celebration. A party of 8 we were seated immediately once I arrived. The service was average, however I know when there's a big party it's not as smooth as a smaller table. The food was decent, however the portions are small. I ordered lobster tacos and it was laughable how small they were, at $20 you would expect a little more especially since they were really good. I also got their crusty crab sushi rolls, omg amazing. It's a cool spot to grab a bite for lunch but not if you expect to get a full coarse meal. The food does not come out at the same time, it came as its prepared. The birthday actually was last to receive her food after everyone else was done. I left disappointed because I didn't eat all day and was still hungry. Food was good just not filling"}
{"text":"The staff could not have been nicer. The place was pretty slammed, as most of the spots within 10 blocks of the stadium were, but they were working just as hard as they could to serve us. It did take a good bit of time for our drinks. It seems there was only one bartender - and of course everyone there was ordering alcohol, so that is always an issue. You can always second guess a place and say they should have more staff working, but you never know how many might have called in sick, or just not shown up, so we tried to keep an open mind."}
{"text":"So excited about all the new bars and restaurants in uptown, and by far most excited about Essex right now! It's been open for not too long and i've already been there enough times to have tried 80% of their menu! The best part about this place is the vibe & ambiance, followed by the food and drinks! I've only ever been here on a Friday or Saturday night, and it's always packed and lively. It's a good place for a small group or a large group.. as long as you're not looking for a quiet and serene restaurant experience :) my favorite drink - simply sage martini! The G & T is nice too, and so is the margarita. If you're looking for a sweeter cocktail, try the Mediterranean mojito. I've noticed they have a pretty neat red wine offering too. Let's talk about the food, shall we! I haven't had anything yet I didn't like.. but if I had to recommend some of my faves - the warm Brussels Caesar, Korean BBQ shrimp tacos, gambas, calamari, lamp chop lollipops! The butter chicken is pretty good too, and the garlic naan - well that's really good... it's more garlic bread than naan, but it tastes great with the butter chicken!! :) If you're in the mood for flatbreads, you can't go wrong with any of their choices. Here's to hoping that they continue to maintain the quality of their food and drinks and fab atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Ive dined at Essex before and it was really good. Today I had dinner delivered to me and was really disappointed. Ordered potato gnocchi and butter chicken.  They added a whole bunch of chewy sun-dried tomato to the gnocchi and the brown butter sauce was sour and watery. Ive had this dish before, it didn't have the sun-dried tomatoes, and the sauce was much better.  The butter chicken was chewy with very little sauce. They messed up cooking the chicken breast, making it chewy rather than soft. The sauce was good but not enough to dip the accompanying bread in."}
{"text":"This restaurant has cool decor and good food. The menu has options with interesting but pleasant flavor combinations. You won't be disappointed with their brunch. The drinks were a little overpriced."}
{"text":"I hate leaving a bad review when the food was good, but the service was terrible.  And I am not one to really complain about service.   I got there at 8:00 on the dot for my 8:00 reservation and asked if we could sit outside (there were 3 open tables).  The hostesses looked confused and said to take a seat and they would see what they could do.  15 minutes later people came in who the hostesses knew and the hostesses beamed at them and told them that they had been saving 3 tables outside so that their friends could have their pick. Ummm... ok... at this point i'm a little annoyed but assume I will be seated next and so I get over it. I then wait a few more minutes and another friend of the hostesses comes in and they are given a choice of the other two tables outside.   Finally...8:25 I am seated. Around 8:40 a server finallyyyy comes by and puts water on the table and asks what we would like to drink, etc.  another 15 min go by, we order dinner, then we are told that they dont have the wine we ordered, so we order a different wine. The food comes...still no wine...FINALLY after we are halfway through the first food item the wine comes. If you are going to have bad service, at least get the drinks to the table.  That is serving 101! We left never wanting to go back which is sad because the short rib ravioli was delicious and the pizza was good and so were the shrimp tacos.   I was talking to people about it at work today and two other groups had the same bad service we had!  They really need to fix this because there are just too many places in Charlotte that have good food and way better service for anyone to put up with this."}
{"text":"Great location with good outdoor seating. Interior is beautiful but very loud!  Dishes are served like tapas. We tried the mussels: they were okay, 1/3 of them were not open so thankfully the manager took off the bill. The sauce was quite nice though.  Shawarma, pretty presentation and decent taste. Butter chicken with naan was very delicious in a creamy sauce with excellent naan bread. It was the best dish.  Brussel Sprout Caesar salad was good, very different but good.  Ended meal with baked Alaska. It was good as well, again, different but good. It was 3 layers of fruit flavored gelato on a thin cake covered in torched meringue. Good textures and okay plating.   Service was mediocre. Overall the food was good, not bad but it didn't leave us wanting to return."}
{"text":"Wow.  Great food and great location.  But small plates... hasn't that been done a million times already?!    So, we arrive to a very excited staff who were eager to seat us. We were a party of 5 so that always presents a challenge... not for these guys and gals.  We were promptly seated and our last minute request for a booth was granted.  Let's get to the food...  The stuffed mushrooms... YAAAZZZ. I was knocked off my feet with the flavor explosion from these guys.  We then has the cauliflower and boy oh boy were we pleased either the curry explosion of flavor.    We also had the ravioli short rib and it was extremely satisfying.  I cannot complain about the quality of food.  But it is always awkward when you don't want to share food and the waiter makes it very obvious that you should share.  Not everyone wants to share.  Sometimes you want all the yummy food all for yourself.    The decoration was modern with interesting accents of chains hanging from the ceiling and photography in frames hanging over tables with tattooed men and women's feet.  I'm not sure exactly what they were doing there, especially with Edison bulbs everywhere, but hey... to each their own.    I will definitely be back and look forward to not sharing anymore food again."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our time at Essex! We had reservations for 6 and were seated promptly upon arrival.  We tried a variety of items and everything was great!! Below are more specific ratings..  Asian-style flash fried Grouper (think bang bang shrimp but on a whole other level). 10/10..crowd favorite!! Perfectly flavored, not soggy, nice crisp and a good portion.  -Brussel Sprouts Caesar salad...8/10..creamy, filling, great flavor..needed salt   -lamb sliders...8/10, very flavorful, comes with 2, cooked to order, crispy exterior for medium but very good.  -Curried fried cauliflower 7/10...tasty sauce, heavy dish, large portion. Good but gets old after a couple bites.  -calamari...8/10...classic, done well! Crispy and great flavor  -Kale and apple salad...9/10...predictable but so good!!  -Short rib ravioli..7/10...very good but primarily cheese..not a real strong indication of any meat. It's good but ravs are small and the sauce is heavy.   Nice atmosphere, decent service, pricey but normal...comparable to Good Food on Montford in my opinion.  A little tricky to find if u are depending on the gps. It's beside the Omni Hotel.  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"The brussels sprout caesar is almost worth adding more stars but the service was terrible and very slow. My sister and her husband had a similar experience (they were hoping our experience was a one-off / bad night for the staff)."}
{"text":"The service here is awful. Our waitress was not very helpful and was never at the table. The food/drinks took forever to come out and the place was empty!!!!  Average atmosphere with very very subpar food and even worse service...Will never come back here again!"}
{"text":"Strange first visit and not so great service.  The brussel sprout Caesar salad was awesome but you go to places for the experience. Given all the other great customer-friendly options in that area, probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The butter chicken with garlic naan is amazing! Love the patio, ambiance and decor is great!   Always had a great experience here. Service is great as well."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm disappointed to have to write yet another disappointing review for a new spot. C'mon Charlotte, please don't make me stay home all the time.  It's been awhile since I went out. Heard about this place, so my friend and I went for food and drinks. It was late (maybe 10ish). We sat at a high top by the bar. We were greeted by waiter - he was enthusiastic if anything. Hear me out... if I have to pay $10+ for a drink, $30+ for entree, and $10-17 for a small plate, I will come with a level of expectation on BOTH service & food. I will expect my server to know Patron XO is NOT to be used as a liquor choice if my mixer is club soda (lucky for me, it wasn't my drink). and I will expect to be informed BEFORE the kitchen closes in case I want more food (instead of that the kitchen has closed, and hope for us to tab out).  Food was actually pretty good. We had the rock shrimp ($15) and the churrasco ($15). The shrimp dish was really good, especially the naan which was great to soak up the garlic olive oil. The beef dish was tiny and an odd use of alfredo sauce on potato. And that was it, that's all we got to eat. I would have ordered more dishes upfront if I knew... and trust me, it led to an epic downfall as alcohol kept flowing.   So here goes another new \"hip\" place that deliver a lukewarm experience on a night out."}
{"text":"Essex is a great addition to the uptown area. I have been here multiple times and have always left satisfied. This is definitely a great tapas restaurant that allows you to try multiple dishes with friends so you can get a little bit of everything. I personally love the brussels sprout Caesar salad. I have also had a few of the flatbreads and those were amazing. My friends highly suggest the buttered chicken and that will be the next dish I have. This place also has a great drink list with a wide variety so you can find something for everyone.  The location of Essex is also great. It isn't difficult to find and it has a small outside area you can enjoy on the warm nights. Each time I come this place gets busier so I highly suggest making a reservation, especially if you want to sit outside."}
{"text":"Took my fiancé here for his birthday on Sunday. Food was tasty but service wasn't so good and it wasn't even busy at all. It took Victoria a while until she realized that we needed refills. My fiancé's cup was empty for a while so I had to give him my water which eventually needed to be refilled also. She just needs to be more attentive. If she's not when it's not even busy at all, I can't imagine how she is when it is busy. I read other reviews about service being bad and I thought since they weren't busy then there's no way it can be slow but proved me wrong. Like I said food was tasty, but the portion isn't worth the money. I'll only maybe come back for restaurant week where the portion would be worth the price."}
{"text":"My first visit to Essex left a very good impression.  I participated in Queens Feast and would recommend it!  Small/medium plates are the name of the game at Essex.  Sharing is caring.  Their menu is expansive of dishes influenced from all corners of the globe.  Therefore, there is something for everyone.    Yummy takeaways from my experience are the following: Anything served with their house made garlic naan bread, butter chicken dish,  prime rib with pureed cauliflower, and the poke tuna tacos.  There were at least a handful more items on the menu I will be going back to try.  Price wise, you're uptown, it is not the cheapest meal you'll find but you can tell the quality is worth it.  The vibe is swanky and can be a great spot for after work drinks or a romantic date night.     They take reservations using open table."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing!! The baked Lamb chops w/ veggies was phenomenal, the baked Alaska was Kalbi beef with Cauliflower Purée was Devine!! Absolutely recommend to anyone in the downtown area"}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day brunch. Paid the same price as everyone else did but did not get to eat several dishes as once they were gone, they did not refill  - if that is the case, they should have stopped taking reservations at a certain point. (I Missed out on salad and frenchtoast among others..)   The serving utensils for the buffet were so gross/unkempt- sticky with various food all up and down the stem of the utensils . They did not keep the area clean even though I saw plenty of staff there.   Food was so-so but the service and above complaints overrode any pleasurable experience.   I'm guessing most people might simply like the ambiance for the nightlife?? Again, I went during brunch hours. Very disappointed  I don't like paying for a bad experience."}
{"text":"stopped in for a last min group dinner without reservations but was seated right away. our server was a bit clumsy almost knocking wine bottles over but was friendly. also refilled our waters constantly which was appreciated. we tried a bunch of apps for the table including the flatbreads - all super tasty, loved the 4 cheese one, and the mushroom app, and brussels sprouts. for my \"entree\" i had the hanger steak which was an extremely tiny portion. the hanger steak came out on a skewer which was interesting. the server recommended ordering 1.5 dishes each as they are considered smaller portions than normal. i thought it was a strange concept esp when you're eating with colleagues. overall the food was better than expected, and the restaurant was nice and relatively spacious."}
{"text":"Love the drinks. The ambiance. The servers.  Can't beat it. Love this place. Great for groups."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you are uptown and don't know where to go. The menu has several options, there is something for everyone. It's perfect if you have guests visiting town and you want to take them uptown. The food was tasty. Sitting out on the patio is great for people watching.  The reason for four stars instead of five was because they didn't have an oil and vinegar option for salads, or at least our waiter didn't know about it because he seemed very confused when I asked for them. He ended up bringing me huge ramekins of olive oil and white vinegar. So if you ask for that maybe specify you want balsamic vinegar."}
{"text":"Oh my YES!!  We stopped in, but clearly needed a reservation for a table on a Saturday night - so we decided to sit at the bar, my preferred choice anyways :)  The bartenders were incredibly knowledgable! From drinks down to the ingredients in each dish! Incredibly accommodating and very friendly.   The food was heavenly!! We started with the Mediterranean trio (hummus, tomato-bisque type sauce, & baba ganoush served with flat bread) - wow, something to kick your tastebuds into high gear! We split the lamb sliders (holy-moly savory luscious lamb!!) and the brussel sprout cesar salad (of which I really refused to share - it's impressive!! I'd recommend ordering your own).  Best tip about this place: everything comes out when it's ready, not on a time schedule - eat & be merry!!"}
{"text":"After my third great visit I thought it was time for a review. I have tried almost every single dish on the menu and nearly every single one has been very good. The atmosphere is upscale but not pretentious. Pricing is fair and service has always been on point. This place is great for guests, dates, after-dinner drinks. I'd even dine alone... they have good tvs at the bar."}
{"text":"Was at conference in Omni and went here because it was right there. Noisy and crowded but waitress went out of her way to seat us off the main room   Waiter was funny and gave use good suggestions. The lamb was unbelievable and everything came out fresh only problem table to small for all the food and plates."}
{"text":"I've visited Essex on a cold December Wednesday and it was packed. Nikki was a great waitress. I tried both the Butter Chicken and the Bang Bang Grouper, both of which were very good as per the other yelp reviews. I recommend you check it out. As others stated, it is a bit loud with dim lighting."}
{"text":"Loud loud loud. Really loud. And I'm not an old person. Bar service marginal.  Wine selection fair. Food pretty mediocre with the exception of a chicken salad that is actually very good. Portions small. Menu limited."}
{"text":"Great food love the dori roll I love the place we went with a group of friends we really enjoy the atmosphere great drinks and the burgers and lamb"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some of the most DELICIOUS tapas in town, THIS is the place to be.  I came here for the first time with a couple of my friends and we ordered a few plates to share. I've wanted to try this place for the LONGEST so I was really excited to finally get the chance.  Our server was really nice and attentive. She was able to accommodate our needs, answer our questions and give us some recommendations.  The Kale and Apple salad was SO crisp and delicious! The kale was tender and easy to chew, the candied nuts added a sweet crunch in addition to the apple, and the dressing cut through the bitterness of the greens so perfectly. I could eat a bowl of that salad every.freaking.day.  The calamari was very flavorful. The sauce that they toss the calamari in reminded us of buffalo sauce. Not sure if that was the goal but we definitely tore it up!!  The lamb kefta sliders were okay. I thought they were dry and needed a bit more seasoning. I think a yogurt sauce would pair better than the chopped onions and tomatoes.   The short rib flatbread was the FIRST plate that we finished! From the time it touched the table we wasted no time digging in. The ricotta was light, the meat was tender and the overall composition of flavors was harmonious. I don't think I've ever had a flatbread so delicious in my life.  The butter chicken was nice- very tender and juicy, and we liked how the \"naan\" was made like a baguette. If you're a fan of  curry then this will be right up your alley.  The Pork Buns were good, but once you dip them in that schechuan sauce??? PERFECTION. The pork belly was tender, the bun was soft and it surprisingly didn't get soggy because we left them sitting there for a while before we started eating them.  Our least favorite was the Gambas al ajillo(rock shrimp). It looked beautiful, but it was lacking flavor. A little bit more salt would've been good and maybe even some more garlic. The oil had little-to-no flavor at all, but the shrimp was cooked nice and the bread was good.  ORDER THE KALBI BEEF.  This dish is so absolutely tender and harmonious you'll be fiending for the last bite! The kimchi was okay-it wasn't  traditional kimchi so that threw us for a loop, but the parsnip purée was smooth and FULL of flavor. It got to the point where  we were literally scraping the plate clean!  All in all, I will definitely be coming back  with more friends to indulge in another deliciously satisfying tapas feast."}
{"text":"Fastest dinner ever. Dashing out of here, never to return. Horrid customer service. I actually had to beg for the check.  Was alone at the bar and the bartender made it clear that making drinks was more important than getting me water along with my meal. He told me as much."}
{"text":"Great food, service and ambiance.  We had a table of four for an early dinner/happy hour. Highlights were short rib raviolis-(everyone at our table voted this their favorite of all our choices) spicy tuna tar tar and Essex dip trio.  The meatballs and Brussels sprouts were good too.  Would pass on charcuterie board.  Pros: location, ambiance, menu  Cons: location/BMX bikers jumping off of handicapped ramp past table"}
{"text":"We had  just arrived in Charlotte and decided to take a stroll down the main street and this restaurant caught our eye the outdoor seating was great to be able to people watch and take in the sights we ordered the shrimp and grits and the rib sliders and they both were very tasty we had a cocktail or two lol and had a nice conversation with our server! I would definitely recommend stopping by and enjoying the sights while you're there."}
{"text":"Have been to Essex a few times; lunch, early dinner, two more dinners.  Complaints from those visits include lousy seating (chair height wrong for tables, weak service, inept hostesses).  Food isn't fantastic but pretty good.   Last evening, 5pm, I arrived with an out of town friend traveling on biz.  Just bad all around; service non-existent (had to get our drinks at the bar), bland bordering on rude staff, plenty of 'workers' standing around hostess stand socializing, incomplete menu given us.   Conclusion: You, Essex, must only be reliant on out of towners/one time only visitors because no one who cares about good service will revisit you.  Me?  I made the mistake three times to let my guests choose the spot.  Not anymore!!  No Essex!"}
{"text":"This place exemplifies Southern Hospitality! I'm not a big fan of tapa restaurants because I just feel like you pay so much for the tiniest portions, but I didn't feel like that here.   I ordered the shrimp and grits and it was really good and so rich in flavor. The one complaint I must say was that my grits were drowned in the sauce and I thought there should have either been a little less sauce or a lot more grits.   But honestly, this place was great. Everything from my drink to the food, atmosphere, location and the waitress. We had a party of 15 and even after arriving so late they were still so nice and accommodating.   I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys good food and good service."}
{"text":"Best brussel sprout salad and environment in uptown charlotte! Great views and great food. Highly recommend for work lunches or dinner out for a date or with friends! The Bloody Mary is also out of this world."}
{"text":"We had a disastrous experience overall. I added a star because they are serious about getting food and cocktails right. Our server was as frustrated as us about the HOUR it took for the 1st of 5 lunch entrees to be served. The first of our party was done by the time #5 was served."}
{"text":"Great please - prices are a little high for drinks but great ambiance. Would give it 5 stars if it was opened later !"}
{"text":"It was whatever. Extremely overpriced. Honestly didn't even think the food was that good. Decent atmosphere, service was good, but that was about it. Came here with a group after a recommendation. Not sure if I would come here again."}
{"text":"Came here with a large work group where the entire  team was cool about sharing plates so I got to try a pretty nice cross section of the Essex menu. Color me impressed overall.   I was able to try tuna poke tacos, cheese and charcuterie, warm brussel sprout salad, shrimp and grits, lobster tacos, bang bang grouper, seafood Provençal and a couple different flatbreads.  Every single thing tasted great with not one loser in the bunch. I would have been perfectly happy to have been the one to have ordered any of it and there is plenty more of the menu I want to tr on the next visit.   My feelings on my the food were shared by the entire group and to top it all off, the service was super. I can't wait to come to Essex again with my wife and other family and friends!"}
{"text":"I went for a birthday party and I really enjoyed everything about this place.  The location is phenomenal as was the service.  It's a beautiful restaurant and the food was great.  There are a large number of choices which could have been bad but in this case was excellent.  I ordered the ravioli but I tried other dishes and everything I tried was delicious even the lemon cake desert."}
{"text":"Sitting out on the patio was really nice. Our server was attentive but a bit awkward but nice. The bang bang grouper was absolutely delicious. The Korean pork bun was my favorite though. We also enjoyed the deep fried olives. Pretty good wine list."}
{"text":"I chose this place to have my grandmothers birthday dinner here because i had been here before when this place first opened because its still fairly new and i was a fan of the food when i came then. The food was still oh so on point i had the calamari, mushroom flatbread,a mule, and the Gambas Al Ajillo .If youre not of fan of spicy don't bother to order the calamari or the gambas al ajilio  they were both spicy hot and im a fan of spicy so i was fine with that and they were both so good people were eating off my plate lol.Only thing this time around my grandmother turned 98 this was her birthday dinner i feel like the wait staff could have been a little more on point. Im not sure if they were super busy or not but we had to constantly remind them to bring menus out, drinks,numerous of times they had forgotten someone had even ordered a drink a couple of the parties checks were messed up they had other people from the party on one check it was just very unorganized and frustrating to some.Oh and one other thing Kevin the manager i had been speaking to prior to this party and reservations had mentioned he would be sending out a baked alasaka for my grannys birthday nothing was ever sent out good thing we werent depent on that we were prepared and my sister from atlanta had 2 custom cake made and brought them there.I was a little disappointed kevin never came and made hiself known since i had spoken with him on many occasions over the phone. I did not see him until the end as we were walking out of the door. Again the food was great as per usual but the service/staff  was a little unorganized."}
