{"text":"Great fish and chips and home made pies. We order 3 types of fish - Haddock, Cod and Halibut. All tasted great with soft and flakey fish inside the light and non-greasy batter. 

We had the steak and mushroom pie. We all liked it and finished it in less than 5 minutes. Also had the steak and kidney pie. I think it tastes good but my family are not fans for kidneys so more for me. We bought home 3 other pies - Chicken, Minced beef and Steak and Ale. All very good and the chicken pie was delicious!

Service was great. Just keep in mind that they close at 8pm so plan to go there for an early dinner."}
{"text":"Reviewers were right... this is the best place i have ever been to for fish n chips.  Batter was right, fries were good and most important, the fish was big.   

You do get a very generous size fish when you order haddock n chips.  The size of the fish is like a size 7 in shoes size.  Can't really think of another way to describe  it at the moment.  Chips are more than enough as well.   

The only thing missing is a side of coleslaw.  I always thought fish n chips would come with coleslaw but this place didn't.  It did come with bread and butter. 

We also ordered the clam strips.  Nothin really exciting here.  Not bad and not great. 

Price for two dinners came out to be $24.  

Will i come back... yes.  If in the area, would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Colleagues and I came here for lunch. Fish and chips Fridays. Their halibut and chips are excellent. Next time, I will take a picture of my fish halfway eaten to show how well the batter stays attached to the fish. It remains crunchy, with a well cooked fish, not over fried, in nice clean oil. My colleague and I eat fish with a dash of pepper, a squeeze of lemon and some malt vinegar. The batter is so, so excellent. My halibut didn't fall apart one bit after I added the lemon and malt. 

Delicious. Ate my fish and chips with a pint of ale.
4.5 out of 5 stars"}
{"text":"Very very hit and miss..  sometimes not so greasy and a decent amount of fish and other times dripping with grease and a bit of fish and mostly batter.  Even the batter is different at times.  Every now and then it is ok but after this latest sample (  I go on Thursday because Fridays are insane)  I doubt I will go back.  For  the money it is simply not worth it.   Truthfully everything in there is pretty expensive... meat pies are very very pricey and they are pretty tiny..  It is mostly crust anyways... for over 8 bucks.   The Haddock and chips are almost 11 bucks before tax... over 12 after tax... I get the overhead thing but far far better to make this without the deep fryer at home.  Basa loins are amazing as long as  you don't over cook them...  coat in sour cream and some onion soup mix and then bread them and bake ..."}
{"text":"If it ain't Scottish it's crap!  This is a quality Scottish mom and pop fish 'n chip shoppe. People travel great distances to get to this small restaurant located in a small local plaza known as The Donwood Plaza  in Don Mills. Easy to get to by car located near Don Valley Parkway and Lawrence. I've eaten here many times. The cooking oil used seems to be a higher quality or is changed more frequently. Older repeat customer base indicates to me that this hard to satisfy demographic is more than happy with their eating experience. Kilts are optional!  Shut Sunday and Monday. Open Tuesday to Saturday 11:30am - 8pm. Free Parking!"}
{"text":"This place looks nice but the fish and chips are just average. It doesn't come close to Olde York fish and chips on Laird Avenue."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times over the past decade or so (I don't live near). I have never been disappointed. Had steak and ale pie recently...it was very good. Would recommend."}
{"text":"If you want really good fish and chips, then High Street is the place for you.  High Street is a small but brightly decorated restaurant where almost all the local people flock too, especially if you're from the British Isles.  High Street is more that the average fish and chip place, they have so much more to offer, hence the name High Street Fish, Chips and...

Come here and try something different, perhaps a Melton Mowbray (pork pie), or have the tatty scones instead of chips or one of the delicious meat pies.  If dessert is you thing, then I highly recommend the sticky toffee pudding.  I think I've said enough, get out here and try it for yourself, but come early because they close a 8pm."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in Toronto! Fish very fresh and the chips was delicious...crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside....even better with the housemade gravy! Portions huge! Loads of parking available....made it very convenient. Had the steak and mushroom pie with chips this time. Yummy! Even took home some....
Only one misstep. The ladies were working very hard, yet I noticed there was one young lady there who was more concerned with herself than with the roomful of customers!
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After hearing numerous adverts for this place on the radio I decided to go last week. Being a Scottish expat a was especially excited that they had both haggis and black pudding on the menu. The food was terrific, perfectly battered haggis and black pudding rounds along with well done fries. Looking around at other peoples food both the fish and pies also looked very good. I arrived at 11.30 and the place was relatively quiet but by 12.30 people were literally waiting to be sat and this is always a good sign! Service was prompt and kind and the establishment is literally spotless. Well worth a visit and a real credit to the traditional Scottish chippie!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great place for some casual British fare food. I come frequently for fish and chips, and their amazing meat pies. The chicken pie is especially delicious with a nice balance of crust, creme, chicken and veggies. It is a great asset to the Don Mills area, selling delicious food for good prices while not relying on pretentious decor or hosts. I go at least 2-3 times a month!"}
{"text":"Great fish and chips! Fantastic selection of fish and pies! Homemade tarter sauce with delicious gravy for your fries! The mushy peas are well seasoned. A must try if you are in the mood for fish and chips!"}
{"text":"Very good quality.  The owner was originally frank mcnies who had a very successful fish and chips shop in etobicoke. The tradition continues here.  All popular fishes represented here, comes piping hot to the table, and they fry in unsaturated oil only so heart healthy.  A bit expensive for halibut but other fishes are average priced.  Also many other menu items like meat pies and tattie scones. Nice light batter."}
{"text":"Found this place by chance on Yelp and I'm really glad I tried it! They have some of the best halibut fish & chips I've ever tasted, really flaky and not slimy like what you usually get at other places. I tried my boyfriend's steak & ale pie...tasty tender beef chunks and really good pie crust. The only thing I didn't enjoy as much were the tattie scones (basically fried mashed potato triangles) which I substituted in place of fries. They were bland in comparison to everything else and lacked potato flavour. I also wish the portion of tartar sauce was just a bit bigger. 

Although the booths are a tight squeeze for four adults, the atmosphere is really cute and cozy and everything is neat and tidy. 

Edit: I think the menu said we were supposed to get bread with our meal but we never did..."}
{"text":"Great quality food and a nice, variable menu.  Service is friendly and the atmosphere is pleasant.  My only complaints are the hours (8p.m. closing time is too early) and the bread is terrible (it's literally store bought Wonderbread).  More effort should be made to bake fresh bread."}
{"text":"I visited recently and things have changed.  The halibut was greasy and the fries were mediocre!  The prices have also increased, almost 20.00 for halibut and chips(1 piece).  I will never go back, sorry."}
{"text":"Meh, it was alright.  The Haddock was decent, a little oily. But the TarTar sauce was weak, tasted like Mayo with some relish in it. Fries were decent, like that they had Brown Sauce as a condiment. Service was Great.
But overall disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is great for fish and chips.  My family lives in the area and we come here as often as possible.  The hours are the only reason we can't get there as much as we want.
Portions are great, fish is juicy and batter is neither too thick or greasy.  We loooove their tattie scones (I think that's wat they're called) and onion things!
Keep up the good work! We'll def be back!"}
{"text":"Very quaint restaurant, but I usually do takeout as it's right around the corner from me. I've only ever gotten the Halibut and Chips and it's delicious. You get a large piece of fish that is not overly battered or greasy with a big portion of delicious fries. It's about 14$ for that meal, kind of pricey, but the value is there. Try their coleslaw too, it's yummy."}
{"text":"Took my mother, mother-in-law, wife and 16 year old son.  Went \"early\" at 5:45 on a Saturday and there was already a line up - but it moved quickly.  I grew up in this neighbourhood and it seems that the people around my parents age love this place.
Food was good, waitress a little funny steering us certain ways (We have Guinness, but not on tap.  And not the good cans with the widget, just the bottle...) but at least she was honest!
Food was very good and satisfied all ages."}
{"text":"Great little hidden Gem that provides an authnetic fish and chips experience that I havent had since Baileys in London! Got the Haddock and Chips With Mushy Peas and Coleslaw on the side. 
Huge fillet of Haddock with a flavourful airy batter. Home Cut Fries with a homemade brown sauce which was amazing!
Definite contender if not winner for best in the city!"}
{"text":"Ai do as the lassies do here at the High Street and order ye fish & chips or their home made pot pies, and as the Scots all sey, be happy while you're living, for you're a long time dead.

One of the few true places to get Scottish food aside from the old MacDonalds, you can get haggis and some black pudding here.  But tis true, Red sky at night, Shepherds Delight; Red sky in the morning, Shepherds Warning and to marry is to halve your rights and double your duties.  At least here at High Street you can reduce some of yer duties and let them cook fer yer lassie.

I had me some Chip and Chicken Pot pie, and it was quite lovely.  They've got a variety of meat pies, and a variety of fish to choose from.  Can't say I'm a true deep fried fish connoisseur but everything looked decently battered, and nicely golden.  I found their chips a tad on the soggy end for my liking, but it was acceptable.  No I didn't try the Haggis or Blood Pudding, but maybe that'll have to be a future UYE, with a swoosh of alcohol and a bit of truth or dare.

I'm not sure how high you can get from High Street, but you're not going to mistake it for crack alley or ho highway, but if you've got a hankering for the fry in this neighbourhood, this be the place says I.

Twelve highlanders and a bagpipe make a rebellion.  Little wit o' the head gives the feet much to do."}
{"text":"The fish and chips served here are probably the best in Toronto.  High praise I know, their fish is fresh, and prepared in a light batter.  The closest I have come to finding battered fish similar to that found in the UK.  It is the chips (fries) that really separate this place from the crowd.  The taste and cut of them is almost identical to that of many a hole in the wall chippy in the North of England.  Thick and crispy, an absolute dream to behold.  

Having been here a few times and enjoying the staple haddock and chips I ventured out to some of the other items on the menu.  Their meat pies are exceptional.  If a little expensive, they are worth every penny.  Generous meat filling, bathing in perfectly prepared gravy make for one very happy customer.  

One menu item that blew me away was the deep fried haggis.  A little skeptical at first of the merits of deep fried sheep organs, I was converted to a haggis lover in an instant.  I don't even look at the menu any more.  I just go straight to the haggis every time.  It is perfect and I wouldn't change a thing about it."}
{"text":"I read all the reviews about this place and travelled quite far to check it out! We were excited for a great meal and sadly it wasn't. The decor was very nice and the staff were friendly. 

Being from Scotland we know our fish and chips, and have gone to a lot of places that far exceed this place. 

The batter was very crispy but the fish was mush! Their house made tartar sauce was very bland. Generally when you get bread and butter it's Scottish bread and that was not the case. The bread was fresh and good, just not what we expected. Our group ordered the halibut and the haddock and no one was impressed.

The prices were also extremely high! 

We won't be going back."}
{"text":"It appears this local place is heading DOWN HILL , we went for lunch at around 1:30 and the place was full, as usual, however something was not right. We waited for a few minutes and no one greeted us, a few tables we empty but not cleaned off. We were sat in about 10 minutes. I asked the server if someone had not shown up, and she replied NO she's on lunch.
Why would the person serving lunch be eating lunch and the dining room is a mess...? Looks like the Scotish have left and so has the character, quality, and service...shame"}
{"text":"I went the first week they opened, lived nearby everything was always great.Thought they were the best since Duckworth s.  The Mcnies owned it.
Wife always friendly, I was at least a once a week regular.
Moved and hadn't been for a while (3 years)
Went last Friday it was OK but not quite the same. 
I asked the server and was told the original owners had sold. Before it would be worth a drive

I thought it used to be 5 stars now just 3.
I live in the west end now. So Kingsway Fish and chips is my go to spot now."}
{"text":"This neighbourhood staple is a must try! The haddock is delicious, with a crispy batter and perfectly cooked fish. Fries are golden and well seasoned. We also love the coleslaw and occasionally order the onion things which are fantastic. This the best fish and chips shop in the city."}
{"text":"Highly enjoyable but quite expensive. Their homemade coleslaw is awesome and they also have homemade tartar sauce that is great as well. 
Not too greasy like someplaces and the portions are well sized."}
{"text":"i love it. The shop looks like nothing from the outside but the halibut with chips are simply amazing. i haven't gotten a chance to eat anything else here, since all i ever get is fish and chips. pretty heavy meal, bring an empty stomach and expect to be stuffed!"}
{"text":"Have been to Highstreet several times over the past few years. Fish and chips have always been good as has the service. On my last visit they had Mahi Mahi which I loved!

Overall still one of the better and consistently good fish and chip joints in the city.  Establishment clean and well kept. My only slight disappointment this time was the price increase across the board."}
{"text":"Had a go at this fish and chips. Looked good, quite busy and had and interesting selection. Two things on the menu stood out. Premium Alaskan Halibut and some sort of surprise fish.

We had halibut and chips with a side of gravy. The fish was tasty the coating nice and crispy!

Now.. the chips. I'm abit confused, biting into them it was firm but dry on the inside. It was odd. Do I not know french fries? It was just off? I did notice 5 fries all stuck together.  I tried my wife's fries and they were better not great. I don't understand it.

We also ordered the home brewed unsweetened ice tea. Look at the picture. So light you might as well call it the low cal ice tea. It was like my water. I told our waitress... and you'll never guess the answer!

\"...this is unsweetened\". 

The couple beside us had the same dish and was asked if they wanted bread. I was surprised to find that ours didn't arrive and the waitress never asked. Another person came to clear our dishes and I enquired about the bread and she said that you should have asked or they should ask you. The menu clearly states that each dish comes with bread.

...people reading this review. I don't want to rate a resturant poorly because I got poor customer (no apology/yes the extremely weak ice tea was charged) but more on my overall experience. Sadly enough the rating should be high but it's only the fish that made me smile. 

Just get the halibut and eat at home."}
{"text":"Wasn't anything to drive for again. The service was decent but food was a bit too greasy. Portions were too big to finish and the fish was fresh. 
Best part of the meal is the pie!"}
{"text":"Opening up my takeout order, I discovered that my favourite Fish & Chips place has begun its downward spiral.  First, I noticed the packets of tartar sauce... I loved their homemade sauce... it was missing.  Then the Halibut with Chips were disappointing.  The batter was very thick... heavy handed battering.  The fish was wet and too chewy.  I have to say that I was unhappy eating it.  I don't know if they are cutting corners or there was a rush at lunch but I am serious ly going to think again when I am hungry for lunch."}
{"text":"We love this place, the haddock is moist and F'in HUGE. I would recommend you get the coleslaw and buttered bread."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a traditional Scottish fish & chips, then High Street is the place for you.  The restaurant is situated on a quiet street in a small shopping plaza.  The interior of the restaurant is super cute and very clean.   Both the staff and customers are older, and everyone seems really nice and professional.  They offer a few different types of fish but I always ordered the \"mystery\" one when I ate meat.  The side options are fries, creamy coleslaw, mushy peas, and onion things.   Aside from fish & chips, High Street also sell a few types of meat pies and fish cakes.  We've tried a few meat pies and they're pretty good except I am not a fan of the cold ones but that may just be personal preference. 

I definitely recommend eating in as the fries do get soggy when you get take out."}
{"text":"the place is very clean.  the fish i had was very fresh and the batter was very crispy.  we also ordered the chicken pie which was good but the pie was taken out of the fridge in front of us and taken to the cook to be heated up.  nothing special about the pie, a bit expensive in my opinion.  it cost more than the fish.  chips, fish and whatever has to be ordered separately.  we did get free slices of brown bread with butter on the side.  i just wish that they give a bit more on the plate than just a fish.  weird."}
{"text":"A gem of a local restaurant tucked away in a little neighbourhood plaza.

The batter/fry is wonderfully crisp and not too heavy.  We tried the haddock and generic 'white fish'.  I would definitely pay the extra $1 and go with the haddock.  We will definitely be back.  A good creamy coleslaw.  The fries seemed to be fresh cut but more importantly didn't pick up any fishiness so either very clean oil or seperate fryer.

Service is prompt and friendly.  Interior is clean and well kept."}
{"text":"The fish and chips are just meh to a little above average. The batter was crispy and stuck onto the fish very well which is hard for some places to do. I ordered the Halibut and found the portion to be quite small. Maybe it was just my order but I found my fish to be a little dry when cutting it up. The fries tasted cheap like it came in a bulk package. I ordered onion rings which turned out to be more like onion peels. If you love onions, then the onion rings is a must get. It comes 6-7 peels of onion on a stick/skewer that is battered and deep fried. The coleslaw was kind of creamy and just meh. 

The service was horrible here. After I walked in, I had to wait a whole 3 minute for someone to greet me or acknowledge I was there. It could've been because I went during the lunch rush that the ladies seem a bit flustered with everything. I had to ask for a refill of water and ask for bread and ask for them to take my order. 

For the price I paid, I rather go somewhere else. I won't be coming back here anymore."}
{"text":"This place is not bad.  Decent fish and chips.  Kinda old school in terms of atmosphere and service.  But not a bad choice if you are in the mood for fried foods."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I loved it both times. There is a lot of parking so no worries there. The prices are good for the portion sizes which are big. The only issue I have is that the size of the place is too small. I think they would benefit greatly with a larger venue."}
{"text":"If i was going to have to pick my favorite Fish & Chips shop this would be it.
They always give good service.
The fish is always fresh and the batter is crispy and just right
Even the tartar sauce is homemade.
Have yet to try their Meat Pies but i hear they are quite tasty.
Definitely worth checking out if your in the neighborhood.
Even if your not."}
{"text":"if you been to Olde Yorke Fish n Chips, this is on par or better since the Olde Yorke \"waterdown\" their fish nowadays."}
{"text":"The fish is great, but the fries are mehh. Watch out for the owner, she a bit rude."}
{"text":"Walking into High Street Fish and Chips on this Saturday for an early dinner made me wondering if I am in Toronto anymore... 

I stood out like a sore thumb walking in to have my dinner alone and as Asian in a sea of mature English diners 

Halibut with Chips ($12.95) 
- the batter is really light and deep fried to perfect crispiness! Golden crispy... really fresh frying oil!! 
- yes it is oily... hey it is deep fried in oil but it is worth the extra calories! and deep frying fish is not as bad as chicken with skin in term of fat content 
- Chips are not bad.. but quite standard... at least they are fresh, made to order!! 

Services here were fast and friendly! The deco is mostly white and super cute! 

Seems like the meat pies are their specialities.. either fresh or frozen to be sell alone or as a dozen!

By the time I was ready to leave, there was a line up for tables!! And it was only 6 PM, I guess people have dinner early here! :P 

Closed Sundays and Mondays!"}
{"text":"Good ole fish and chips. I am not exactly a fan of it but I liked this one.  Not too greasy, just perfectly cooked to my liking. The place is very clean and full of old people and what looks like regular customers. This place I heard has been in the business for awhile and it only means that people are coming back to them all this time. I might come back if I come to this part of town again."}
{"text":"WHAT? This place is awesome. The best halibut and chips in the city I have tried yet, and I've lived in Toronto for over 30 years(staff is also super friendly and deserve a raise no matter how much they're making) . This is the spot, no matter what part of the city you live in, it's worth a visit for sure. Not sure why they close so early, but I think 9pm or 10pm would be more acceptable even for the family crowd who like to eat a little later on weekends. Still, the food is so amazing and fresh, I still give this place FIVE STARS ALL DAY, SON!
*****"}
{"text":"Excellent fish place. Went there last night for the first time. Good pricing, good serving size, excellent tartar sauce.
Area to improve: service- I had to ask for someone to take order, had to ask for bread, and had to ask for a water refill."}
