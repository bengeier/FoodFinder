{"text":"This place is amazing. Great prices, fast service( even when it's packed) never disappointed."}
{"text":"Am I crazy? Or are all of you?   These rotis taste like a bunch of chicken bouillon cubes and water with some meat swimming in it. The skin/shell wasn't even that tender, chewy, or tasty.  Granted I'm partial to east Indian rotis but this place is near where I live so I had to see what the fuss was all about. Sincerely disappointed, it's just curry powder and chicken base, salty and boring in my opinion.  Sorry! Won't be back, I'll stick with the pinnacle of all rotis (Mother India/Gandhi Roti)."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the outside (or even the inside side) but it's got a nice family owned atmosphere and the food is awesome."}
{"text":"When I worked at King and Dufferin this was a regular lunch spot. Great food, friendly service, but usually a line up out the door at lunch time. I almost always get the spinach roti there... it rings up around $5 and is super filling. How can you beat that?"}
{"text":"Arrived at 7:47 pm would not let me eat in Only take out  Well I said I will go elsewhere to a restaurant that wants my business  Booo island foods bad customer service"}
{"text":"Island Foods is one of the things I miss most about not living in Toronto anymore. Their veggie rotis are amoung my favorite meals on the planet.  Anyone who can make cabbage, carrots and potatoes taste that amazing deserves huge accolades.  No frills, just straight up authentic, consistent, delicious and affordable food.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Food: Read a lot of great reviews on yelp about this restaurant and was really looking forward to trying it. Got the jerk chicken dinner and a spicy beef patty. Ordered three jerk chicken dinners along with three parties, came home to discover that there were only two patties in the bag.  Patty: very different than others I've had. The pastry was really dry and relatively thick. The meat had great spice and texture, overall not bad, would get again.  Jerk chicken dinner: again had a lot of jerk chicken dinners and by far, this was the worst. Rice and peas was with lentils instead of kidney beans and it was overcooked and mushy. The skinless chicken breast tasted like it was boiled, chopped up with jerk sauce poured on top. The jerk sauce was spicy but didn't have good flavour.  Service: not the place to come if you are in a hurry, takes pretty long.  Really wanted to like this place given I live in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The owners run it like a good old fashion business and know how to treat their customers.  The food is amazing and always fresh and well prepared.  This location (and the chain in general) take huge pride in their food."}
{"text":"I'm extremely grateful to have these guys supplying me with decent lunches out in the burbs, where I work. Things can get a little backlogged at high noon, during the lunch rush, but they keep the line moving. Not too much room to sit and linger, especially if you're in a group over 4. Take away works best.  The rotis are well above average and good value. The deserts are tasty, and the people who run the place are friendly. Thanks Island foods!"}
{"text":"I love Island Foods' roti.  I've been to the King St W location and when they were at Village by the Grange but they closed this location.  So sad when I found out they closed because they were right on Dundas and McCaul, a very convenient location.  Both location served delicious fresh roti, I usually order just their chicken curry or just potatoes roti depending on what I crave.  Haven't had anything else but roti.  Island Foods roti beat other roti I had because their roti is made fresh.  Love the gravy and hot sauce they add to the roti.  I recommend the King St W location to anyone craving for freshly made roti.  Price is reasonable.  Good for lunch or dinner.  Go early, tends to be busy during lunch time."}
{"text":"Shrimp roti was fresh and was nicely filled with potatoes and shrimp. I'm not keen on the roti shell since I much prefer the jamaican style. Prices are comparable to other roti shops."}
{"text":"Crispy outside, hot and delicious inside. One of the best vegetarian lunches you can get in Liberty Village at an affordable price. Highly recommend the eggplant roti."}
{"text":"I dare you to find better roti anywhere in Toronto. Believe me, I've tried. And nobody beats 'em. Soft, tasty shell, juicy insides. Total yum. I've been driving out of my way to eat roti from these guys ever since they were at Dufferin Mall, waaay back when! And when they're at the CNE in the summertime, I can't eat anywhere else inside that food building. Alas, I'm hopelessly addicted to Island Foods."}
{"text":"I love island foods. I've been going here for over five years, and I've never been disappointed. It makes me really happy to be able to support family-run businesses, and this one is wicked awesome. Always friendly, smiley staff. Always hot and delicious food; my faves are the channa and/or chicken + channa rotis AND let's not forget the doubles. ohhhhh those doubles! The peppersauce is bad-ass and it's actually got kick AND flavour. The gravy, another saliva-inducing feature!  Island Foods is always my GO TO place if I don't feel like cooking, or I just want a mean roti."}
{"text":"There was a big lineup when I came and I get why. Very reasonably prices and it was my favourite Caribbean style roti I've ever had. The gravy is amazing and the roti is smothered in it. When you cut it open it pretty much explodes with the deliciousness. Liked the functional and unpretentious vibe in the restaurant. These people are great at what they do."}
{"text":"I swear, my parents only come to my house because they know they can get rotis on the way home.  Or on the way there (I'm not a very good cook).  I don't blame them, though, because this place is delicious!   You might have to wait a bit at peak dinner times, but if you call in your order before you come, they'll have it waiting for you.  Also, if you can, let your roti sit for a bit before eating so it doesn't spill all over when you cut it open (if you can--they're so tasty and I'm so hungry by the time I get them home)."}
{"text":"Gluten-free spelt rotis made fresh and filled to the point of bursting with incredible curry flavour.  You can find a better roti in Toronto, but if you find one closer to my work, please let me know!  The melt-in-your-mouth goat curry is my usual order, but the chicken is awesome and the channa and spinach is so good and perfect for when you're feeling a little vegetarian. You can ask for spinach on any of the rotis, and I heartily recommend it. You must try the chicken/beef/vegi patties, they are so fluffy and the filling is seasoned perfectly.  There are all kinds of Caribbean drinks including Malta, Coconut Water, Ginger Beer, Ting, Mauby and Peanut Milk.  Have a beventure!  Once in a while they will have fresh doubles, but never before 12, and they go quickly.  This is classic Caribbean fast food and they are awesome, and if you get the chance, try them!  Island Foods also sports a full selection of ice cream including sour sop, mango and rum butter.  There is usually a lineup for lunch, and you can probably find a table, but it's primarily a takeout establishment.  Rotis are around $7 and patties are under $2."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and the service is friendly. My big complaint, though, is that it's way too slow. I've been there a few times and the wait is always long, no matter how short the line is. The staff always seem to make the food with no sense of urgency, even when there are a lot of people waiting. I love the food but waiting 20 minutes or more is big-draw back to going here."}
{"text":"I go here every week with work, roti is always delicious and fresh, great value, love the hot sauce"}
{"text":"This place has the best roti I have ever had in my life and it is such an all-rounder.  The roti looks unspectacular but it is in-veritably a hidden treasure of sumptuous curry, hearty potatoes and flavourful meats (chicken is the prevalent order of the day). My personal recommendation is to ask for their special hot sauce on top and drizzled with their oxtail gravy. Pair it with a grapefruit soda and it kicks off your day.  The joint is plain and serviceable, so don't expect to bring a first date here. Maybe when things are more familiar or going with your buddies."}
{"text":"I love this place for three important reasons;  1. The food 2. The price 3. No attitude the folks r great Love the chicken , goat  no all the rotis and believe I've tried them all 4-5 times each , the doubles are worth the wait and I love the oxtail Dinner. The rice and peas with chicken gravy and hot sauce is a great belly  filler, it reminds me of my friends mom making us rice and peas at her house the ting and the other soft drinks and beer can't be beat. The only reason I stopped making it a regular stop  was I was stacking on the weight, so I make a pilgrimage   Once okay twice a week but no rice the carbs are killing me"}
{"text":"After not stopping in for years since I no longer work nearby...I decided to stop in for lunch! My curry chicken was so yummy and I took a jerk chicken home for hubby.....he loved it! The staff were lovely...I think the owner has her teen children working with her.....so polite and they are engaging, ensured we are well looked after while dining in and ensure we have all we need with our take away. Amazing! Can't wait to go back for a roti!"}
{"text":"My favourite roti place.  I recommend the Jamaican patties and the chicken / goat roti which are really tasty.  I especially like the sauce so ask for extra sauce when I order the roti's.  Apparently, the ox tail is great too but in limited quantities each day so order early.  I'm not a fan of ox tail so this is based upon what some of my friends order."}
{"text":"Food is good .. don't question the receipt, ever lol  Also they can close as early as 1 hour if they are slow !!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for many years, I really like the food here the Roti's are good and the doubles are the best very fresh. I wish they had more locations."}
{"text":"Get there early for lunch or else you're in a long lineup that stretches to the door."}
{"text":"I wasn't pleased with the oxtail dinner, the rice tasted kinda burnt, no salt was added and was covered with oil( I don't know if it was because of the steam vegetables) The oxtail itself tasted burnt was dry and had alot of fat with no flavour.It was not worth 9.32$.  Being Trinidadian I thought it was quiet disappointing. I didn't even finish it I had to throw it out. Stick to the things your good at !!"}
{"text":"Based on the number of previous reviews I would normally steer away from adding another. I find too many reviews actually makes it harder to decide or you spend twenty minutes reading the same thing from forty different people.  In this case I felt it was nescesarry because I noticed a lot of people starting their review with \"I haven't eaten roti before\" or \"I haven't had many...\" and so on. I have eaten a lot of roti, and ox tail stew, and that oh so sweet Caribbean style coleslaw and Saturday soup. I was partially raised on it and trust me, Island Foods is nice, but it's not the best in the world.  The rotis are rather small but the dinners are a good size. Sauces are a little on the oily side but have good flavour. I don't find the hot sauce all that hot but that might have something to do with pepper training as a youth.  Snacks are good for the most part but tamarind balls are an acquired for most people. The doubles aren't bad but I find they go down like bon bons because again, they're a little on the small side. My advice is to try something you've never tried before.  You would have to be crazy to not like Ting and if you've never had a Tiger malt you have to try it at least once. Drinks are pretty standard otherwise.  The dining area is a decent size but yes, the bathrooms are cramped. I found the \"visit our other location\" sign a bit odd too since there was no mention of where it is and to be honest I haven't bothered to find out.  All and all, Island Foods is a great place in that small row of food shops but you have to take it in context. Your other options at King and Dufferin are two burger places, two sub places, a coffee shop, pho, pizza and falafel so it's not hard to be near the top of the good eats heap in that pile. Outside of that small row Island Food is a tasty yet average place to eat."}
{"text":"For the lover of roti, this is spot delivers.  Size is medium and flavour is big.  Goat and boneless (curry) chicken roti are personal faves.  Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I had the beef roti. It was spicy but delicious! There is so much flavour in that one meal. Try the peanut drink if you can."}
{"text":"I eat a roti once a week and im confused by these great reviews.lol it's ok  but no flavor and watery gravy. You cant even get it with extra pepper to help the flavor out. This place makes rotis for those that like to try it out which is fine. Just saying there is much better rotis out there. And just in case some dont know pepper is hot sauce.  Not black pepper :p"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in this restaurant and what has taken place, that I am being forced to air out my complaint on this site.  My husband and I have been going to this location of Island Foods for many years. Despite the fact that the veggie options are a bit too salty for myself, and the spinach is reaaally oily, I still love indulging once in a while. Great options for veggies in need of a quick meal. Especially the doubles-what else can one say about channa tucked into that fabulous double 'bread'? Well, my husband arrives home one day with a couple of take-out veggie dinners, and realizes that a mistake was made with one of the orders. He called to see if it could be fixed, and handed the phone to me so that he wouldn't get too upset. Instead of any nice customer relations, we dealt with a woman named Kim who refused to give me the name of the owner and refused to pass me on to any one else besides herself. She told me that the mistake was on my husband's behalf, and refused to accept that it was on the other end. She was rude, and told me that this issue had nothing to do with me since I was not there. Kim was so rude, and eventually she hung up on me, refusing to deal with this situation any further. Even after stating that we would no longer be going there, she basically laughed and said that it didn't matter. I am going to write a letter to the store, in hopes that it actually reaches the owner or someone besides Kim, as I have the feeling that she'll just rip the letter up and toss it into the garbage. I have NEVER encountered such RUDE and OFFENSIVE treatment from any one in the restaurant business before. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Great Trinidadian Rotis here! It is a no frills kind of place so don't expect 5 star service. The prices are very affordable, less than $6 for a chicken roti and about $6.50-$7 for a boneless chicken roti or boneless goat roti. There are also other Trinidadian staples like currant rolls, doubles, stewed oxtail with rice, tamarind balls, etc but I l didn't try anything else besides the rotis and doubles.  The rotis here remind me so much of home, I had the boneless chicken and boneless goat, both were great. The boneless goat roti is in a darker curry sauce as a result of more geera in the curry while the boneless chicken is more yellow. The rotis here are \"saucier\" than rotis I have had at most places back in Trinidad or anywhere else in Toronto, so it maybe messy to eat at a park (I was going to take my food to go to eat this at High Park but seeing the amount of sauce deterred me).  The pieces of meat are tender but not dry or fatty. The boneless chicken roti is made with only breast meat, so the fact that it was not dry was impressive. The dalpourie which is the wrap was thin enough and nicely cooked (I like rotis that have that \"poxy\" look derived from a nice hot  cooking plate).  Overall, I really loved the roti, the only complaints I have are (1) that the roti does not automatically come with channa, you have to pay extra, all rotis come with curry potatoes though, (2) that they close at 8pm on most days and 9pm on Fridays, that is kind of early but maybe I am just a night owl.  Overall, I think this maybe my new favorite place in Toronto for Trinidadian Roti, my hubby likes here too but prefer Ali's Roti shop, I disagree since I like the dalpourie at Island Foods more. My ranking for Trinidadian Rotis in Toronto right now are: (1) Island Foods, (2) Ali's Roti (3) Caribbean Roti Palace (rotis here are kinda dry)"}
{"text":"Went: 5:15 pm Thu July 23 2015 Ordered: Boneless Goat Roti and kola drink Cost: $11.00 The goat Roti was a huge serving and only cost $7.95. We split it among the two of us. If there is not enough sauce, the roti can be a little dry and it is not flavourful enough to enjoy by itself. It did not taste that different or better than similar food at other Caribbean restaurants. That said, it was pretty good. The curry on the thin roti reminded me of lasagna for some reason. Bottom line: It wasn't excellent (7.3/10=3.65/5=4/5), but it was good enough that I would come back, especially for the price and since we didn't try the Tyng yet."}
{"text":"Awesome roti! I particularly like the chickpea. The sauce is drool-worthy. For a snack the beef patty is a solid choice.  I've gotten both take out and eat in meals here and both are fine options. Be aware of the time that passes between ordering roti and eating roti. It could be a sad, soggy mess if not careful.  I'm a big fan of the decor -- it's so...tropical. And it's a big space so there's plenty of room to spread out my elbows and dig in."}
{"text":"We went to island food on don mills south of York mills. I got chicken thighs on potato, rice and possibly banana? Also got a Coke. Good, though spicy, 5/10. There was a line up for takeout. Just over ten dollars, which is reasonable."}
{"text":"I had the boneless goat roti - was very good! Service was friendly, and I didn't find it slow at all, even though when I entered the queue there were 2 others making their orders before me.   I've also been to Mr. Jerk on Wellesley and would have to say the Mr. Jerk goat is better, however I plan to try other menu items at both restaurants because both experiences were stellar."}
{"text":"I followed my fellow Yelpers' advice and went for the boneless chicken roti with mild-medium heat.  They are right. Those were some of the most tender morsels of chicken breast I've had in awhile, and there's just enough flavour without overwhelming me (and my colleagues) for the rest of the afternoon. Another nice thing - the portion is still oh-my-goodness-my-gut busting, but compared to other roti portions in the city, much more manageable!   One note: I ordered ahead for pickup and appreciate the quaint brown lunch bag it's served in. Just be sure you have a plate handy wherever you're headed, cause that brown bag will definitely not agree with the sauce explosion to come."}
{"text":"yum yum. there use to be an island foods in the grange, so when i went to school i'd go there for lunch. i'd often get a patty on a coco bun with curry for under $2. the prices have gone up since but the food is still delicious.  i can't deny that their rotis are beyond amazing. they come with mild & spicy options so there is something for everyone. i personally love their chicken and spinach rotis. the fillings are generous and one roti is extremely filling. there are always huge line ups here during lunch so try to avoid going between noon-1pm if you are casually in the area. service is friendly, straight to the point and fast. decor, simple and functional. this is a no frills place, their main focus is the good food. everything is laid out in trays so you actually see what you are getting. they make the rotis in front of you. no pretense, no bs, just stomach pleasing meals."}
{"text":"Awesome roti, friendly staff and great prices! Very busy around lunch time with huge lines."}
{"text":"Great place. Great food. I have tried the Rotis many times, and they are very delicious and filling. They Jamaican beer is also worth a try. Go to this place and stop reading reviews."}
{"text":"Saw the previous reviews and wanted to try this place. I wasn't impressed. The food was mediocre... Not all that great tasting Not going back."}
{"text":"Roti is top notch.  Can't say I've had better.  The oxtail is tasty, but a little skimpy on portion size.  Ask for extra gravy on the roti for more moistness"}
{"text":"I have been going here since the first day they opened and I can honestly say there are so many things about this place that annoy the hell out of me but their great food keeps me coming back.  First annoyance: Closed Sundays and many non-standard restaurant closing days during the year.  Since, I don't work in that area anymore I can only go there evenings and weekends.  I can't recall how many times I craved this place after a round of golf.  Second annoyance: I don't think I've been able to have their doubles for over a year now.  Why? Because they NEVER have any (it seems) outside the hours of 12-5pm.  I would go there after work time after time and no doubles every time.  And it's not like they won't be able to sell them.  Many people come in after me between 7-9 and ask for doubles.  Third annoyance: Their portion size for their Oxtail dinner has gone WAYYY down.  It was my favourite thing to get but after the last time when I got TWO PIECES (literally), I don't want to get it anymore.  I don't get full from it and it's the most expensive thing on their menu ~$7.50.  Those are the major annoyances so here is the good stuff.  The food is made fresh.  The rotis are spiced really nice and tasty.  Their oxtail is my favourite meat there.  I really like how their gravy is not \"goupy\" like like other places.  Its thin like a jus.  The jerk chicken may not be the traditional in the sense that they use the breast, but I like their jerk chicken better than a lot of other places I've tried that many say is more \"traditional\"."}
{"text":"boneless goat was watery... beef dinner was watery... please do not try those...not worth the money"}
{"text":"I have to say this is one of my favorite places for Rotis.  Especially West Indian Rotis.  I usually go to Mona's, but this is a great alternative.    I ordered the chicken roti, with boneless chicken breast.  The pieces of chicken were big pieces and i had a bite of chicken in every bite.  The sauce was spicy and cooked just right, not too watery.    Can't wait to go back.  Actually going today to try their shrimp roti.  A great place, friendly staff, nice family business."}
{"text":"Never eating here again.    Had lunch here last Sat. Not sure what all the fuss us about - the roti is good but it isn't great.  There are many places that will provide you with a tastier and better quality product in Toronto (ie. no msg). But that is not the big issue. The service at this place is absolutely rude and unacceptable.  The women behind the counter put 4 small pieces of potato on my roti - less than one spoonful as compared to the guy in front of me who got at least twice as much. So I asked if I could please have a little bit more. She said she would have to charge me.  Surprised, I said \"but I just want the same as you give everyone else\". In an incredibly rude manner she said \"it WAS the same as everyone else. Do you want the roti or not?\"  Of course I had already paid at this point and didn't want to argue so I diffused the situation by walking away.  Totally reminded me of the soup Nazi on Seinfeld!    Don't step out of line if you decide to go here."}
{"text":"Spinach and potato roti is to die for and I could eat the doubles by the stack.  I have absolutely nothing ill to say about this place except that I wish they were open a bit later to cater to the work-lates and night owls.  Keep up the awesome roti, Island Foods."}
{"text":"Andrew likes nothing about it. Kartik says it's small. Keerthi needs more gravy. Fernando does not like the soda.  And everyone agrees, there's too much roti and barely any meet."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 9/10 Food: 9/10 Atmosphere: N/A Service: N/A  I've never dined in at Island Foods, but the takeout speaks for itself.   Their food packs a punch, with their homemade hot sauce a must on any dish. They serve up roti, curry and other dishes piping hot, authentic and just delectable if you're looking for bold flavours.   I'd recommend the goat roti, or any roti for that matter!  PRO TIP: cash or debit only!  THE BOTTOM LINE: bold flavours that will keep you coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food, but don't show up between 12-1:30 unless you have 30 minutes to wait in line (it's worth it if you can spare the time)."}
{"text":"Whenever I come to Toronto, the first thing I do before I visit my house-ridden mother is visit this place a pick up a spicy goat roti for myself and boneless chicken for my mom.  It is a great place, and while I've had better in the city, I like the consistency of goodness I get from Island Foods.  I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to this place.  I just wish that someone would bring this concept to Kansas City (we have one place and it is mediocre at best)."}
{"text":"I got pretty sick after eating here this past weekend....it was bad. yuck"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!! i would be back there everyday if the line ups weren't a kilometer long. once every month or so though its a must! no matter the length of the line up. half the office makes an order, then we send a pour soul or two to get the stuff and haul it back to us. its almost like Christmas.. only no eggnog : )"}
{"text":"Oh island foods you are always worth the trek out to dufferin and king, and the line up to the counter around dinner time always seems to drive everyone in line crazy. Your dishes are exceptionally juicy and i have never been able to enjoy the food unless i ate it piping hot on the spot or it just becomes a soaked mushy mess by the time i take it home."}
{"text":"I recommend the doubles, goat rotis. But the wait line is very long, we waited about 30 mins"}
{"text":"After my Jamaican food hiatus for about 3+ years I decided to make the trek down to this place for lunch with a buddy of mine.  Originally I was going to go with what I normally order at any Jamaican place (Jerk chicken or Stew chicken on rice) but while lining up to place an order I noticed everybody and I mean EVERYBODY ordering a rotis. So I jumped on the bandwagon!  I got the Chicken (curry thighs) roti with a side of rice and gravy. The meal in itself did not look too spectcular at all but what was waiting inside that roti was an explosion of flavors and niceness.   It also looked like a small portion but 3/4 way through my meal I was starting to get pretty full. The side of rice and gravy was just what I needed to get over that bump and kick me into \"belly full\" mode.   Careful though the Chicken Curry thighs have some small bones in it and the cashier was nice enough to mention that to me at the time of ordering. (Dont know if she tells all the customers.)  This place does not have the best jamaican food I've tried but after a long time away it was a great welcome back meal.   A little out of the way but I would visit again if I dont find a better place before that.  Chilling atmosphere and big dining room with lots of places to sit.  Now time to sleep! :)"}
{"text":"I crave roti ever since a friend introduced me to them at this Island Foods. I'd had some in the past, but never, ever like this. It's quick, on my way home from work and D-lish. I always get the shrimp roti with a little bit of hot sauce. The roti bread here is way more spongy, flavorful, and thick than other places I've been. Not sure if they make it from scratch, but it is a soft wrap around curried potatoes and big, juicy shrimp in some broth that blows my mind. The folks who run this place and really nice and efficient, too."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last week and doubt I will ever go back there. They have the absolute tiniest rotis I have ever seen in Toronto. Regrettably the prices do not reflect the sizes. To be fair, the prices are  about what rotis generally cost elsewhere in the city but everywhere else, the rotis were twice the size.  The goat roti, which I asked with a drop of hot sauce, only after being reassured that the rotis were not spicy, was so spicy that my mouth was burning. There was not a whole lot of filling in it either.  The chicken and beef rotis contained marginally more filling and thankfully we did not ask for any hot sauce on those rotis.  Service was both fast and efficient."}
{"text":"The nice thing about Toronto is that you can get authentic ethnic food like this at a reasonable price, unlike the hipster watered-down versions you'll see in a city like in San Francisco or LA. Let me start by saying this is the best Caribbean roti place I've ever been to and one of my favourite lunch places in Toronto. Seriously, try it, it's amazing. Everything on the menu is good but I especially like the goat and the chicken thigh (the one with bones). I used to take a 30 min bus ride just to come here for lunch. Worth it doe."}
{"text":"What's the big deal?!  I've lived in Parkdale for over a year now, and I've always been curious about Island Foods. I love West Indian food, but I don't eat it very often. I told myself the next time I had a significant craving, I'd walk the two blocks to Island Foods and try it out.   Let me tell you, if this ever happens to you, walk the five minutes up to Queen and Landsdown where you will find four other roti shops that are FAR superior to this place. Island Foods is HUGELY disappointing.   I ordered a goat roti with hot sauce and a beef patty. The patty was yummy (though heavily spiced with scotch bonnets, so keep that in mind before diving in), but the roti was bland, the sauce watery, the potatoes overcooked, and the roti itself had a very pleasant chew, but was made without salt so it too was bland.  I'm shocked that this place seemingly has a licence to print money, seeing as the line-up was out the door on a Friday afternoon. Another shocking revelation is that a lot of the people eating here were West Indian! WHAT?! West Indian people eating here when there's so many better places around?   Bacchus Roti Shop is around the corner at Queen and Cowan, and it's WORLDS better than this place (Though it's a little more on the expensive side). Ali's West Indian Roti Shop is half decent too, and about the same price.  This place isn't worth your time, but it is cheap. So... if you're looking for something close-by, and something \"cultural\" and inexpensive, this is the place, unfortunately. DO NOT go out of your way for this place. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's right by our chiropractor and we make a point of picking up some lunch for every visit.  Great flavours & tastes, it's great for me, my wife, and our 1-year old boy.  From roti to rice dinner, we love it.  Cons: the wait.  Whether there's a line or not, I can't figure out why it takes so long for the kitchen to put the rice & peas into the boxes.  It's all pre-made, there's no reason for this to be a slow operation!!  It'd also be nice if they offered a larger portion.  I'd pay for the larger size, because their portions for Caribbean food are TINY.  I always end up eating my own lunch, and then finishing what my 1-year old son couldn't.  Even my wife, who has a small appetite, can finish her roti.  C'mon Island Foods, make a large.  You'd make more money that way too."}
{"text":"Amazing Roti, I have had it numerous times and it is always great whether you like it spicy or mild they will make you smile."}
{"text":"I come to Canada once every few months and every time I'm here I stop by Island Foods at least 3 times per trip. Every single time it's amazing. The girls are so sweet and I feel like they remember me even though I don't come that often. The way they make each roti is like a craft. Only thing I can say is they need a vacation! They work very very hard. Anyways, they will always get my business when I'm in Canada."}
{"text":"Holy crap. They really meant the extra hot. My mouth was on fire but that was a lot if fun.  Ordered the goat curry and ting . tender goat no smell and delicious spicy curry. Ting was a nice drink but too $$ for the size."}
{"text":"This one merges the best and the worst of the rest and gets it all right.  Food preparation visible for those of us with anxious tummies? Check. Generous servings? Check. Flavorful filling with discernible ingredients? Check. Dahl puri with a tender subtlety flavored pastry? Check. Hole in the wall cred? Well, it looks like a McDonalds but it's located at the border of Leslieville and Parkdale. That's close enough to a hole in the wall for me. Plus I can actually sit down here. Convenient, since I will wait in line for my food.  We tried boneless chicken, shrimp and canna rotisserie and they were all fantastic. Its nice when good p,aces stay god. Sorry to see the location at village on the grange is gone. I hope they open another one where I don't have to depend on the fickle charms of the 504 streetcar!"}
{"text":"Ordered the boneless chicken roti, hot fresh and warm bang for your buck on a cold day. Friendly and warm staff. I'll be back fave roti place."}
{"text":"The best oxtail,I have ever eaten in a long time I have tryed other places,But this one is the best"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that Island Foods is one of my most favourite places to grab an amazing roti on the cheap. The staff is always friendly and warm, even when line-ups are out the door.  However, I've watched the quality of the Boneless Goat slip from some of the best I've ever had in 2014 to the chewiest piece of blubber I've ever put in my mouth. What happened?!  My biggest gripe though is with business hours and the speed of service here. Everybody just seems to move at their own \"snail's pace\", paying almost no attention to the growing line of increasingly infuriated customers who watch their dwindling lunch break minutes tick by in line. Also, on at least 4 separate occasions they have been 30 mins late to open, and 30 mins to 1 hr early to close (!!!). Unacceptable.   So please, for all of our sake:  1) Open and close your restaurant during the hours posted, AND  2) Move at a \"chef's pace\" during rush hour... You can afford to \"risk a little bit of heart disease\" by rushing a little more, so the lot of us don't have a coronary in line.."}
{"text":"Walked in ecstatic to try famous West Indian food. Line up was long which is even more exciting to me because food = good.   I am greatly disappointed at the food that was made. There was SOOO much salt in the food it took away the taste of the oxtail dinner I ordered. Oxtail meat was tender, but extremely salty. Had to throw my dinner out...   Tried the beef patty too, and there was too much crust compared to the meat. Taste really blend. Probably won't be going to island food again. Definately not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Alright, you got me.  I am upgrading to 4 stars because Island Foods deserves it!  Since my last review, I have been here 3 more times and each time the food as been just great. I had the boneless chicken roti twice (- it is just so good!), but I also tried the spinach roti. It is delicious as well.  The place has been busy each time I went, but they are still throwing out the orders hot & fast. I can't complain.  Also noteworthy: The staff is super nice. Last time I went, our 2-year old started yelling \"Pizza! Pizza!\" when one of the ladies were preparing my roti and they were genuinely just entertained and not annoyed at all. ;)"}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST FOOD I HAVE EATEN IN ALL OF CANADA. we need one of these where I am from. The line takes 30 minutes during lunch. They only take Canadian debit and cash, I found this out at the front of the line. The line cooks are very much on island time. They work slow but smile and seem to enjoy it. They were very friendly. I got the roti with goat. Then beef. Then chicken. This is seriously the best food you can find. I believe the cuisine is from Trinidad but obviously Indian foods. Some locals showed us this spot and we came back three times. Rotis are the only thing I tried but everything is bound to be perfection. My favorite was either the goat or the chicken. You can't go wrong here. Go back often. I tried to take a picture after I ate most of it. It was so tasty I forgot about my Yelp duties!  Easy 10/10. I will be back here on my next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"My niece recommend this restaurant so we decided to give it a try. We ordered doubles which were dry and tasted like they were pre made it was bland. We ordered the meat pie . This was much better  the meat filling was nice and spicy..The  roti skin was on the  thin side . The curry chicken was a little overcooked. But the flavor was nice and warm with some hot ssuce. We tried the oxtail.  It was dry and the rice did not have much flavor . We were able to get peanut punch but from a pre made container . It was decent. I prefer  the roti hut"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this restaurant so I thought id give it a try, I had $10 as my budget and thought that would be more than enough to get a meal to fill me. I decided to get the Goat Roti and was incredibly disappointed.. Not only did I pay $10 for the smallest roti available in the market, but I also ruined my pants by how messy it was made, more sauce in the roti than actual meat. The place is not very clean either which is why I decided to take it to go. I'm not sure if the other locations are better but this Don mills location was a terrible experience all together."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. Dave, Nalla and the kids are beautiful people. The care and the love that goes into their food comes out in the flavour;easily the best roti in the city.  There's a lineup during the lunchtime hours however it's worth it.  Plenty of parking next-door if need be."}
{"text":"Hands down best roti in the city! You may have to wait in line for 10-15 mins but trust me its worth the wait.  We've been coming here for the last 10yrs now and the quality has been consistent and so has the flavour.  I tend to mix it up with the chicken thigh, and eggplant roti, and their jerk chicken is pretty good too!   My favourite thing about their roti is how saucy it is yum!"}
{"text":"mmmmmmmmm .......... love the Roti's!!!! They used to be in the food court of Dufferin mall ages ago... loved it then and still love it now!!! Tried them all except the beef... chicken is perfectly done, the veggie is my favourite - they are always too big for me to eat so I end up taking half of it home. The doubles are good too!!! The place is clean, the service is quick and the employees are happy."}
{"text":"My sis and I come here when we can.  It's the city's best goat roti IMHO.  Service is island style slow but worth the wait.  Tender chunks of boneless goat, potatoes, and gravy nestled in layers of roti skin.  Really good and you can get a bottle of Ting to go with your meal!"}
{"text":"The roti's are the best in the city--always consistently well made.  My usual order is boneless chicken.  My last order was packed full of chicken breast I could hardly finish it.  My only complaint is the quality and taste of their patties--they are TERRIBLE,,dry pasty filling, hard heavy pastry.  I believe the patties are outsourced but compared to Michideans, Allan's even Tinnels they are truly awful.  They would do well to try another patty supplier."}
{"text":"everything is great but the chicken roti is my fave. very friendly even when the line is almost out the door. i miss this place. i used to work close and would come as often as i could."}
{"text":"I've fallen in love with this place as the food is awesome!  I like spicy food but I am picky as hell so I can't stand the \"mechanically separated\" meats found in so many foods.  This was my first Curry Roti experience and now I crave it huge since I had it!  I also grabbed Jerk Chicken as I was working nights and had no time to cook...... it was great (even reheated).  I have no complaints about this place. Call ahead as this place is busy. Island Foods is ERIE!!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the most delicious chicken curry roti in Toronto! I always get the \"boneless chicken roti with extra sauce and hot sauce on the inside and out\" for $9.32.   The lines are no joke as its often up to the door which takes approximately 30 minutes. There is only one person on the register and one person making the dishes so be ready for a looong wait. But!! The wait is always worth it because the creamy curry goodness never disappoints. I came when it opened once (11 am) and by 11:30 the line up was already up to the door.  (The price must have gone up because i remember the first time i got it for $8.75)"}
{"text":"Food tastes very good here but a bit pricy. Partly because they target office worker form liberty village."}
{"text":"Finally tried Island Foods last week and ended up making two visits. Can't wait for a third trip!  The first time, we both had the chicken thighs roti and a double. Amazing! Super friendly service, and watching the roti master make those rotis is a real treat, too - the technique is special, because everything in this roti is so perfect. The hot sauce is mixed in just right with the potato curry liquid and the meat liquid... Wetness is perfect. Size is perfect. Filling, but not a monster-sized roti. Prices are low. Keep doing what you're doing, Island Foods. We'll be back!  For our second visit, we really wanted another roti and another double, but were committed to trying one of the plates. It looked like they weren't serving doubles that day anyway (Saturday), so that helped us stay the course. We both had oxtail stew - it comes with rice and peas, potatoes, veggies (mostly cabbage and onions, with some carrot and peppers). Hot sauce on everything and a second dose on the stew. Our mouths were burning! Again, perfect amount of meat / potato sauce for the rice.  Don't fool yourself thinking you can rush in here and get out quick - there will probably be a line-up of dedicated Island Foods fans - including me - waiting patiently before you. Join us."}
{"text":"Went over for lunch (12pm) and bought boneless goat roti for $9. I totally forgot to ask for the extra sauce so I struggled to finish it off. The place can get packed fast during this time of the day so if you're in a rush, I wouldn't suggest it."}
{"text":"I came here after my husband kept telling me the roti was amazing obviously I had to see if he was right or not. I am happy to say I have eaten my words and they were delish!  I ordered the boneless chicken roti with some extra gravy on top (thanks to my fellow yelpers reviews) and boy was it mouthwatering. The filling is a potato mixture with some just right seasoning and big chunks of white meat chicken. My only one critique would be perhaps smaller chicken pieces? But, really the roti was yummy nonetheless. If your going to eat in, extra gravy is a must- a must you hear me!   I'm happy to say this location has gained another regular customer."}
{"text":"The place is the same just now they skimp on the meat in the roti and way too much oil, the pepper sauce is terrible. the roti's are way too thin. and sometimes burnt, oh well at least its the closest to Trini food!"}
{"text":"Been eating rotis at this family-run establishment for 20 years. The quality and taste have never wavered. Their pepper sauce is the best I have ever tasted! The channa roti is sublime."}
{"text":"Roti is tasty. Service is only okay. Go here if you have A LOT of time to waste. Getting a roti even if there's no line (which there always is) will take upwards of half an hour. They charge you .50 just for the plastic container which was weird too."}
{"text":"decent.  not spectacular.  i will say their store hours are terrible.  ive been here 4 times driving by wanting to try and they were closed at 8pm.  very disapointing in that sense at least for my sceduale.  sometimes the roti is better but today that plus the curry jerk was mediocre.  i would go back though...but in this area there is not too many carribean options."}
{"text":"This Island Foods is strategically located along a stretch of Manufacturing Industrial area while facing Residential across the road.  I can definitely see this place as a lunch spot for those local workers similar to how Patty King does for their nearby customers.  Nice staff taking order and prepping the Rotis and Meals.  It is more of a Fast Food place as you are served on styrofoam plates and plastic utensils.  They accept credit cards when you purchase over $10.00 as I attempted my MasterCard.  I got a Goat Roti($6.75) & Grace brand Ginger Beer.  The Roti wrap was A-OK and the Potatoes included in each Roti were perfectly done.  The Goat itself was originally tender but the more I ate the more mushy it felt.  I guess being left in the steam tray does take a toll on the Meat.  Although there is slight spice in the Sauce, it is even too light for me and I wished I said YES when they asked me if I wanted Hot Sauce.  When given this decent portion of Food, it's really good to have flavour to the very last bite.  A-OK, Island Foods."}
{"text":"This has been my go to place for Roti either before or after a TFC or Wolfpack game. I usually get the chicken Roti as a dine it and have them put extra sauce on top of the Roti and back it up with a beef patty which I use to clean up any extra sauce.  Taste and flavour always consistently delicious. Family run business. Usually always friendly. There's usually one person taking the order and another person making the order. Be ready for line ups!!!! They're usually steady slow but over the years I've gotten used to it. I went there twice this week and they were slower than usually and the staff seemed off (silent and weren't smiling). When I arrived there was a 4 person line up to order and pay but the staff weren't moving. When the line up started to grow to 12 and up to the entrance door there was no attempt to speed things up. There were people who weren't in the line up and had already ordered and were still waiting for their meal to be made.  Some days they stuff your Roti with meat and other days no my much and put more potato. The saving grace is flavour and taste consistency. Always delicious. They also have their own delicious hot sauce sold in a bottle. I'd go back for sure. Just expect the line ups"}
{"text":"Island foods is consistent quality, reasonably quick, reasonably tasty west indies fast food.  Decor is cafeteria, the lunch rush typically is out the door and the food preparation could be improved for speed (esp since all the dishes are pre-prepared).  All that said, it's a popular place for people in the area for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Island Foods is fine, but overrated. The price to portion is too high, you don't get a lot of meat (mostly potatoes and sauce), and the service is SO SLOW. It's well known for being pathetically slow.  If you walk in and see no one in line, you may think \"oh I will be in and out quickly\" but you forget the people who have already ordered and are waiting for their food. The employees stand there having polite small talk with their customers when I just want my food.  All in all: it's pathetic it takes this long considering the food is already prepared. They're scooping it from trays in front of you. No grilling. No baking. No toasting. Nothing other than \"scoop a few pieces of meat, add potatoes and sauce, fold, fold, put in foil bag, hand to customer\".  My co-workers and friends put it nicely when they say they're running on \"island time\". They have this laid-back sloooow vibe. When it's a lunch rush, they need to work more efficiently... because the line is always out the door.  Taste: It's decent. The curry sauce is nice, but I'm never blown away. Also when you specify your spice level, it's a subjective amount of hot sauce squirted from a squeeze bottle, meaning some bites have a lot of it, others none. That's not what I want.  Value: I personally don't see the value. Usually I have to add a beef patty or doubles, otherwise the roti alone is not enough food for me to feel satisfied.  I would rather go to Mother India (10 min walk away) and get their butter chicken roti. I know it's a different style of cuisine, but to me it's only $3 more and nearly twice as big. Plus it's so much more yummy.  I'm not trying to bash the place off 1 or 2 visits, either -- I've been a good 20 times to this location, and 10+ to the Don Mills location. Between the speed, the lack of value, and the taste not blowing me away? I don't see this place as all that enticing. I mean it's fine, but people tout it as the best of the best.... and I disagree.  The other location has faster service, lower prices (I think? It's been a while since I was up that way), and they seem to understand people want their food, rather than wanting to waste time waiting.  P.S. The rotis have a shockingly high calorie count for something that doesn't taste THAT rich. Usually when I eat something around 1200 calories, it's a heck of an indulgence. Nothing about this is so mind-blowing as to justify around 60% of your daily caloric intake"}
{"text":"I went there today and tried the Goat Roti. It was quite tasty. I asked for it with a bit of spice. They asked if I wanted sauce on top, I said \"sure why not\". It was filling, very tasty, and had lots of meat that was cooked perfectly -- nice and juicy throughout, not over-done at all.  The curry sauce that is inside as well as on top was very flavourful and gave it a very rich and somewhat spicy kick. I was pleased with how it enhanced the overall dish. The potatoes were soft and complimented the meat nicely.  My only real complaint? The price is a bit on the high side... and while it was enough to fill me up for quite a while, I think it would be more worth it if it were around $6+tax. If that was the case, I'd go there quite often. I know goat is considered a \"premium\" meat, but I still feel the price was a little steep.  Others complained about long wait times, but we had the complete opposite experience. My friend and I were one of the only few customers, and the establishment was basically empty. No issues at all. It was about 3:30 pm on a Tuesday afternoon. Perhaps if I had been there around noon it would be a different story, but I was quite impressed by their efficiency. From when I ordered, it was under 5 minutes until I received my order.  In terms of overall impressions? I'd say it is a place I would return to, but due to the price, it'll be a rarity for me.  The staff was very friendly -- they asked all the right questions to cover all bases, and it was spiced just like I wanted: just a bit of spice, nothing overpowering. I know there's a history of West Indian foods having a high tolerance for spice, so I figured even if I said \"just a bit of spice\" that it would be relatively spicy for my palette, and it was -- enough where I felt it, but where it didn't take over. I was not disappointed.  The second time I went, I got the Beef Roti which was really good! Again, the meat was juicy and not over-cooked! That same beef curry sauce on top was great.  My friend got the Eggplant Roti, with the 'chicken' sauce on top. I tried a bit of it. It was good, although we both agreed the beef sauce is far better.  Curry Goat Roti: $7.95 Beef Roti: $6.95 Eggplant Roti: $5.95 (prices as of Aug 2014, before tax. cash or debit only)  Both times we got Peanut Punch to drink ($1.50), which is a fun Jamaican treat. It's unique and tasty.  In short: would return, wish it was cheaper, but satisfied overall."}
{"text":"Friendly service. The price was decent.  The food, I've had much better. Ordered a spinach roti, a boneless goat roti, and a shrimp roti. Tried the first two. Upon watching them make the rotis, we noticed that the roti to filling ration was skewed. Not enough filling. The spinach was bitter. The goat was so dry that it flaked apart when I stuck my fork in it. The curry was bland. The roti itself was thick and tasted like a tortilla. Will I come again? No."}
{"text":"this was one filling lunch! The problem was that I waited in line for almost 25 minutes to get it. The staple food item - chicken roti, add a little hot sauce to it and BANG - you have one Delicious lunch on your hands. Compliment the roti with a bottle of Pineapple juice.  The service staff are all family, and create the roti's completely from scratch. Don't expect to get a smile unless you say something witty, or kind about the food. Eat in, or take out. This place deserves the accolades its receives from all of its loyal patrons!"}
{"text":"I have to start my review off by saying, the staff who work here are so funny! The girls are amazing and have an island vibe.  Love coming here, love the food.  Its consistently good.  I've never had a roti here that wasn't absolutely perfect!!!! Thanks guys. :)"}
{"text":"Island Foods makes my second favourite roti in the city. Since my favourite is all the way on Queen St West, I rediscovered my love for the Island Foods by visiting the Don Mills location on lunch today. Boneless Chicken Roti w/ Potato and Spinach ftw.  So yeah, if you are no where near the west end, this is your best bet for a good roti!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since indulging in Island Foods, as in full disclosure, my go-to roti joint is on Queen Street. But regional proximity to Island Foods gave me a chance to stop in for the first time in years. This time, instead of takeout I even ate in the restaurant. The place hasn't changed from what I remember. Not that that is a bad thing, as consistency in the restaurant game is actually a good thing, especially when you are coming back somewhere for the first time in a while...  Basically the east side of the building has the counter you walk up and order from, and then wait for your food at. There are a handful of tables filling up that area otherwise, and then the entire west side of the building is more seating as well. It's a no frills looking place which is further enforced with the use of the styrofoam plates you're served with even if dining in (although they did at least provide metal cutlery, which promptly cut right through said styrofoam).  I had the boneless chicken curry roti, with spinach added. It was pretty darn good, especially good with the hot sauce served on the side (seriously, that hot sauce is great). I'll admit their rotis aren't the biggest and the wrap itself isn't the best versus other competitors, but it is a solid meal and quite delicious, and they might just have some the best pricing out of the bunch. 1 curry chicken roti w/ added spinach and a bottle of Heineken comes in just over $15 after tax, which is a pretty good deal.   I'm still going to stick to my usual roti place, but it was nice to switch it up, and will say its the best of the \"east of Dufferin\" roti shops I know. And they get the bonus points of actually having parking behind the building."}
{"text":"I had a meeting downtown and I was looking forward to a oxtail stew dinner (with the bone on) but I was told the location had changed. Oh Oh! now what?  When I got off the streetcar I was talking to my friend and he asked  me where I was and he said  to eat at this place.   I look up from my phone and here I am. Bingo   Oxtail it is!  As soon as I walked in I could sense we were on island time due to the line up and the slowness of it all and the miserable looking customers.  So I ordered the boneless goat special instead which had rice and peas and curried potatoes. $7  It took a long time to get this onto the serving tray and I cannot figure out why. The workers were busy but in no hurry.  So I can say it is worth the wait and they do have Dragon Stout in the fridge so its all good.  Lay back, relax, your in Trinidad and things take a while but its worth it! Home cooked Trini food made by people who care!  I would add a star if they added another person for the dinner shift to speed things up but 15 minutes is a bit much to make up a dish from the hot serving trays.  Its not a fancy place but when have you ever had Roti and oxtail in a place with cloth napkins and white table cloths?"}
{"text":"Doubles make me so happy! Was very happy to find them here when picking up an order. I love doubles and I love Toronto so together my belly is in paradise! Was visiting from the states (TX) so of course we don't have a lot of spots like this. Great customer service with a smile! They probably couldn't help it since I may have been grinning from cheek to cheek. Check out the doubles, patties or roti here when in the area!"}
{"text":"Okay it's true -I eat here often, this is the kind of place you take your mother / kids out for food.  Hence family atmosphere and a well-lit bright ambient.  The format is; Order food at the cash register and walk back to table and chairs to eat,  Mall food court ordering look/style.  Green and oversize tropical pictures within.  Pride in ownership noticed by Restaurant Extreme Cleanliness.   Both owners are as friendly as it gets and you can tell they genuinely appreciates your business.  Food Roti is fresh!, delicious and well seasoned.  but you may need to have a change of close as the Roti is extremely drippy."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch from Island Foods a few times. The rotis were delicious. The prices were reasonable. Staff were somewhat impatient...we were told to wait about half an hour for the jerk chicken for an order once. When half an hour was up, we were told (rather impatiently) that we had to wait another ten minutes. The jerk chicken ended up somewhat dry. Apart from the dry jerk chicken, Island Foods is great for rotis - just be sure to order as soon as they open!"}
{"text":"Totally delicious.  Stopped here before a holiday road trip to Kingston in order to avoid highway fast food.  I ordered a chickpea roti and bae got the boneless chicken. Have to say this is my favourite roti I have tried to date. The roti was thin and tender plus the curry was oh so good. Their house made hot sauce is also super tasty - a must try if you are into heat.  Thinking of going to grab one right now - YUM!!"}
{"text":"Hey Island foods, ur alright. You're on the outskirts of Parkdale so your location couldn't be more sketchy but u still manage to cook some delicious rotis. One thing though, hurry the fudge up when people order! You see a line up that stretches out to the entrance and still I see NO hustle.  AND you're always out of doubles.  AND you're closed on Sundays?! What is that!?!? I totally need you on the sabbath day! And you close early, it's just too abrupt; it's disorienting.  It's like a mother ripping a baby away from sucking her nips all of a sudden. Try EVERYTHING on the menu, everything tastes so succulent. These people are quiet geniuses.  People will say that $6 is expensive for a roti, but eat one and try to tell me ur not full. Rotis are usually 8-10 dollars so this aint bad.  They serve boneless for cryin out loud! 4 stars!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location for several years now. It has always been consistent in the quality of food served. Always fresh, always tasty. Their goat roti is the best in the city. Friendly service and a clean establishment to boot."}
{"text":"I've never had a roti before I went to Island foods so they've really set the bar for the next place I try! It's a very nice, home made, flavourful curry wrapped in a wonderful Indian tortilla (Im not sure what it's called). I tried the goat and the chicken thighs and they're both super tasty! The goat is incredibly tender and the chicken is fall off the bone amazing. The potatoes are stewed with the meat yet are the perfect texture not too hard and not too mushy. It looks like a pleasant size in photos but it can really make one full for an entire afternoon and evening.  I'm also slowly tasting each of the exotic drinks they have. I LOVE ting! It's so refreshing and not too sweet. It tastes like an elevated sprite if you can imagine! There's another guava juice I tried but I didn't like it, it was really sweet then bitter.  Looking forward to trying the dinner plates next time with rice and other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the vegetarian food was not that greatest. The doubles were probably one of the worst I have ever tasted(this is an understatement). Doubles are meant to have a splash of flavour, full of chutney, hot sauce and channa. These doubles consisted of runny Channa and the \"house hot sauce.\" I think they forgot to add this hot house sauce to my doubles.   The spinach and Chana Roti were mediocre. My boyfriend did enjoy his goat curry although it was quite small and watered down. The jerk chicken however was not that great. My boyfriend recommends ritz Caribbean for your jerk chicken fix.   I believe the ratings that are given to this location are based on those who haven't tasted good Caribbean food. Toronto lacks a good Caribbean spot for roti and doubles.  After this negative experience on a Friday night, I did discover a nice Caribbean spot down the street. If you have the opportunity ditch Island foods, a location consisting of rude waitresses and head over to Ali's West Indian roti shop. The customer service is 10x better then island foods and the doubles were just as much better. The doubles were soaked in tamarind and hot sauce and nicely cooked channa."}
{"text":"We love the food here. Have eaten here literally dozens of times, and always enjoy our meals. Food is delicious and consistent. Service is friendly. Be prepared for a line-up, though."}
{"text":"Amazing boneless chicken roti,, also the spinach roti was great,,, Decent price and good portions."}
{"text":"The lunch that keeps on giving the whole day through!  I discovered this Parkdale gem when I lived out there and often make the journey to King & Duff when the craving for 'boneless chicken roti' is too great to turn down.  I've never tasted better roti anywhere on earth. For heartier appetites, grab a spicy beef patty on the side. I would consider that meal as my last if I was ever on death row..."}
{"text":"The rotis are excellent, especially the boneless goat. However the Oxtail is very very bad. My beef is the long wait times, this place could use a lesson in efficiency and respect for other people's time. I am very busy at work, I eat at my desk and you cannot place phone orders under $30. I try to come at 11:30am or after 1:00pm however the woman whom makes the meals takes her leisurely time. They could really use some additional staff, I would eat here much more often if they could get me out the door a faster."}
{"text":"I have a lot of fond memories of Island Food, from eating it at the CNE to going to the Don Mills location for lunch. This location though is new to me, though it looks to be older.  Benefits of this place is the ample parking in the back. Not often you eat downtown and there is a parking lot. This plaza is so big with it's parking lot they could build a condo on it (and who knows, they might).  This restaurant is quite large with plenty of seating. The decor though looks a bit dated, despite being on outskirts of Liberty Village/Parkdake/TrinBellwood hipster areas.  I can't help but compare it to this other roti place I went a week earlier. This place is much cheaper in the $7-9 range, though there is not as much filling as the other place. It still tastes great though!  The staff has that carribbean/jamaican laid back aura. Helpful, but not the fastest.  Still, there's a lot of love for rotis and Island food in my books. This place keeps churning them out for many years of consistency."}
{"text":"This is the best roti place in the city bar none! I have tried their chick pea (channa), and chicken rotis, both delicious! You have the option to add spinach and hot sauce to your roti (topped with a sauce if eating in). The wrap is well made and doesn't fall apart, and the roti holds up well when I've picked up my food for take out. I have also had their chicken and beef patties. The chicken one is milder than the beef one.  Yes there is often a line up during lunch, but if you go after the usual lunch hour you should be ok. You do have the option to dine in or take out. The staff is quite friendly and get to know their regulars."}
{"text":"Island Foods used to have three locations. Now they closed the one near Queen Street west. I visited all three of them and my fixed menu is Boneless Chicken Roti with hot sauce. The hot sauce is not that hot - just enough to give your tongue a tinge of spiciness. The Roti is made with lentil inside which makes it very delicious. The portion is big enough (with lots of potato and gravy, in addition to boneless chicken, inside) to make you full. It's a family run chain and sometimes you may get some attitude from the proud family members!"}
{"text":"Owner needs to hire an extra staffer.  At least on Saturday when we went.  Spread the wealth. Lined up over 10 minutes, only saw 2 employees. Tables were covered in food, spilt liquids. Very dirty. Had many, many better tasting chicken and Chana rotis. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here with my Sister a couple of years ago.. phenomenally good ROTI. Large portion good price. Truly a hidden gem, almost hidden..but worth every mouthful once found! They also have a ginger pineapple beverage that I have not been able to find anywhere else, and is it ever good!"}
{"text":"This family-run joint serves up some of the best West Indian food in Toronto. Prices are a tad bit high for this type of food, but you get what you pay for. Everything is great. Highly recommend the roti... it is something special. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Depending on the night, the service at Island Foods can be a bit slow. I tend to stop by Island Foods before work, so I don't risk spending break time waiting for my food. I love the chicken roti and after trying it last night, the chicken dinner plate, and that's what keeps me coming back to this place. The food is dee-licious."}
{"text":"Island Foods is a busy place, which is a good sign in my books. Parking is available but all spots were taken (I lucked out and nabbed one).  There was a lineup from the counter to the door, and it moved at a reasonable pace.   I ordered a boneless goat roti and a Ting (yeah, Ting!) to go since I wasn't sure if I'd get a table.  Although they have lots of tables, they were filled with people!  The rotis are served on styrofoam plates or, for to go, in foil coated envelopes which keep them nice and hot.   The rotis all come with potato in them, and it's just the right amount to not overwhelm the meat. And the goat was deeeeee-licious!  Seasoned perfectly and amazingly tender. I wanted another, even though I knew I'd never get through a second one.   In addition to Ting, they offer a variety of drinks from Grace as well as regular pops and juice.   Recommend this place and will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"I've never heard about this place until my boss treated everyone at the office for lunch. He went to do a run and asked everyone what kind of roti they wanted. I didn't know what to get but someone mentioned how the chicken channa was really good so the chicken channa it was! I heard this place gets super packed for lunch so try getting there early or go later after the lunch hour rush.  An hour later and there it was, the chicken channa roti...and a couple of patties. Took a bite out of the roti and it was delicious. It was fresh and the right flavours were all there. Good portion and well priced. Their Jamaican patties tasted alright but it was a nice spicy treat."}
{"text":"Food was alright, some dishes better than others.  Could have been better. If you like your food with an actual kick to it, make sure you ask for extra hot sauce, because if you just ask for hot sauce, it's barely even mild. Beer would have been more enjoyable if it was colder.  Unfortunately I had the runs the next day, so maybe its because I ordered a dish that wasn't so popular, regardless it wasn't fresh.   Wont go out of my way to come back here again  Shame because staff is really nice and kind."}
{"text":"Island food is my favourite Caribbean food place in the city. It's a family run business and that family is there everyday cooking and serving  up the food.  Give yourself lots of time. There is a huge line up everyday.  I usually get a roti with goat or chicken/ hot sauce and I always add a patty.  What stands out about this place over most? You can taste how fresh the roti bread is.  Often they are made to order.  This makes all the difference to me. Served always with a friendly chat and smile."}
{"text":"I first discovered Island Foods at the CNE years ago -- they have since let their lease there expire. I asked why one day and they said because everyone had babies and got busy :)  The food here is delicious and affordable. My fave is the Goat (boneless) Roti -- so juicy. The doubles here are moist and succulent. The staff are very pleasant. The drink selection is excellent with a good variety of Grace juices and some interesting other drinks you'll never find at other restaurants.  I went there about 3:30pm on a Saturday and it was steady flow of busy customers and fresh cooked food being brought out all the time. There seems no risk of food sitting still for hours -- this is a popular place!  Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've had roti that was as good as it is here anywhere else. The gravy they put in the roti is just enough that if you leave it to sit it gets all soaked up in the roti. It's awesome. Just like a wrap. My favourite is boneless goat with spinach - yum and the vegetarian dinner.  EVERYTHING is delicious here - the various snacks they have is a must. I became a lover of Malta, coconut barks, tarmarind balls and Ting. Broke? no problem. Have a bowl of rice and gravy - it's $3 and healthier than anything else around there.  ONE THING. SUPER SLOW SERVICE. I used to work across the street and would frequently order ahead only to see that they are not yet made and I have to wait in line. ALSO. IF YOU ORDER TO GO, YOU BEST NOT EAT IN THE RESTAURANT. I have been told a few times now - that if I order to go, I must go because I'm wasting take-out containers and stuff. I guess I should apologize for changing my mind to eat in and enjoy a warm roti. Not to say that the staff isn't friendly - they are always nice. JUST SLOW.  Otherwise it has my vote as the best joint West Indian food."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm....Roti. There are certain foods that even for the most fickle of western tastes will still satisfy, and Roti is one of them. Don't like anything other than burger and fries? You'll still love Roti, and why? Because it's like stew on bread, and it's just that good.  I have often thought that the best foods come from countries who are not the wealthiest. Roti continues to back this theory up. Not for the carbohydrate adverse, this is a meal brick, almost literally. It's shaped like a brick, and has the hunger stopping power of a brick if it were made of bread, delicious sauce, meat and potatoes. Price wise there can be no complaints as it comes in at below $8. This particular place has a nice selection of imported Jamaican soda (loaded with sugar, who cares) and they made up 6 Roti in under 5 minutes. Plenty of seating. Meat was a tad bit dry for some pieces but was good nonetheless.  Why are you still reading?? It's Roti time!!"}
{"text":"MMMMmmmm. Island Foods.  I currently have a Channa (chick pea) roti in my hand and I am in complete and utter bliss.  At $4.75/channa roti you can't really go wrong.  I sometimes splurge on a Shrimp roti which is still reasonable at $6.95.    Their plates (everything from bone-in chicken to lamb) include rice, mixed vegetables and roti bread and come reasonably priced as well. (I think the most expensive one was $8).   I must also mention that their beef patties are very tasty and they have yummy juices such as mango and blueberry-pomegranate, which compliment all the spice flavour very well.  And while I'm on the topic of spice, when they ask \"hot sauce?\" ask for A LITTLE bit.  I like spicy food but damn...can't handle THAT much heat.  Service is as fast as can it be, but expect long line-ups at lunch time.  The same couple women have been working there for years, and know what they're doing.  We've never been disappointed with the quality/value of the food here.  A definite must-visit  ............Now, back to my roti!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a big big fan of the boneless chicken roti. He orders it almost once a week!   Great service, great food. Beware, there's usually a lineup running out the door and around the corner at lunch time.   It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place gets a lot of great rep, but it does not live up to the reputation all the time.  People who come here, swear by it and have been coming for years.  If you go around lunch, be prepared to wait in a queue that stretches out to the street.  The food is good, but nothing to rave about.    I don't like Roti bread, so I always order platters/dinners.  The chicken  (bone in and boneless) is the best dish probably.  The Oxtail comes second.  Then the beef, then everything else. The shrimp is not worth it since you literally get 3 shrimps.  The goat is also good, but it is an acquired taste.    Overall, not a bad place, but definitely not living up to the hype."}
{"text":"My client loves to come here for roti's. Roti's aren't quite my thing, but I guess this place is good. I dunno, perhaps too much potatoes for my taste. I'll eat it if that's what we're getting, but it's not my favorite."}
{"text":"Married in to a Jamaican family so I'd like to think I know West Indian food (though they might disagree!). Island Foods is not the best by any means, but it is decent. The beef patties are delicious, and so are the doubles, but the jerk chicken is not that great. Usually one would say big chunks of white meat are a good thing (if you're trying to eat healthy), but good jerk chicken normally consists of various cuts of the bird, giving it more texture and flavour. I found Island Foods' jerk rather boring. You definitely need that oxtail gravy and hot sauce for the rice as they are the only things giving it any flavour. Can't say I'm a fan of the chunks of cabbage mixed in there either. This was my fist time there in a long while, but if I recall, the roti is quite good. Service was very friendly and prompt. I would go back if I was in the area but wouldn't make a special trip. I like the joints just north on Queen West better."}
{"text":"I used to work near by and went a couple fo times a month, running into it's review page on yelp reminded me that I do miss their Rotis.  Will I bother to go anytime soon?  I don't know it's hassle.  Very short hours, basically out of reach for people with a later work schedules - and frankly the service was infused with an \"I can't wait to go home\" attitude, slow and unenthusiastic, really made customer feel like an imposition.   Having said that, the curry is really good especially in the Roti, and the Roti shell itself is exceptional with a substantial but fluffy texture and adding a tiny bit of sweetness to the dish ( I know people who order just the shell for a snack).  However it's not the biggest or most filling Roti out there.  I may go back at some point but the short hours and indifferent service definitely curb the urgency."}
{"text":"One of the best roti's in the city of Toronto. Unfortunately this secret caught on and you will generally find one of the slowest lineups anywhere. Good food wins out over this place being able to deal with customers in a timely manor."}
{"text":"I could probably count the number of times I've eaten roti on one hand.  It's weird because the few times that I have eaten the dish I've enjoyed it immensely, so why is it not something I order all the time? It's truly a mystery.  Anyway, I was getting set to head to a concert at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre and I wanted to grab a quick dinner. I wasn't really feeling the other options in the area, but Island Foods caught my eye because of how crowded it was at such an unusual time. (It was just after 5:00.)  Obviously I was going to get a roti but with so many choices, it took a little bit of thinking to figure out what to get. (Fortunately I had plenty of time to ponder given that I waited about 20 minutes to order.) I decided to go with the Boneless Chicken Roti and I asked for extra hot sauce on the advice of a fellow Yelper. (Thanks!)  The food was ready a few minutes later and I was excited to finally dig in. It's good. Actually, it's really good. Though the chicken perhaps isn't as plentiful as one might've liked, there are some strong flavors here and the spice level was just right. The roti itself was fresh and it held up well to the saucy goodness inside.  This probably isn't quite a contender for best roti in the city - I still have dreams about the roti I got at Gandhi several years back - but it's a tasty and affordable option if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I love Island Foods! So tasty. Get in ma' belly!   The Boneless Chicken Roti is my go-to. I also love the Channa Roti. And of course, a Ting to wash it all down.   This place gets busy during the week, as in lineup-out-the-door-busy, so it's best to keep that in mind if you have limited time during lunch, etc."}
{"text":"I often frequent this place because it is the closest Caribbean roti place to my house. It has ample seating and friendly staff.   When I go, I normally get the chana potato roti with some doubles. The chana potato roti is yummy, very similar to most other roti places. It is a bit bland, so make sure to ask them to put pepper sauce and make it spicy (if you can handle the heat).   The doubles are okay.  They are good enough to satisfy a craving, but cannot compare to the wonders of the doubles in Scarborough.    Feedback: it would be amazing if they had pulourie to go with the doubles."}
{"text":"Ca't see why people like this so much.  We dined here because we could not remember the name of the restaurant in the next review, which had been recommended to us.  We visited that one after obtaining its name.  Jerk chicken her consisted of slices of chicken breasts with lots of bone in them.  Not much spice and due to the slicing there was little flavoured skin in prortion to the meat.  Rice was very gummy.  Roti's seemed more like filled tortillas, and the potato one has a curry sauce that was unpleasantly gloppy and tasted like little more that curry powder and cornstarch.  Skip this one"}
{"text":"Best Caribbean roti I have had in downtown Toronto. While I love Caribbean Roti Palace for their doubles, I found the roti at Island Foods saucier and more delicious. Friendly staff, lots of tables to sit at, fridge full of Grace bottled sodas including their spicy ginger beer. We had the goat, chicken thigh, and chana rotis. I will be taking any excuse to stop by King and Dufferin in the future."}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken in Toronto. Period.  Fresh, delicious and moist white chicken meat another in there amazing jerk spices.  Very simple and approachable food done right. What keeps me coming back is the home made hot sauce!"}
{"text":"I try to make it to this joint once a week.  The roti goat is amazing, make sure if you ask for a double you bring your appetite because it's quite the task to finish.  Also skip the potatoes in favour of extra meat.  Gravy on top is a must.  If you're eating in try and make it before noon or you'll end up taking out.  I'm no roti expert but I make it a point to come all the way from North York (Yonge and Steeles)."}
{"text":"I enjoy West Indian food and know when I have had good food. This is not the place. I did the mistake of ordering the oxtail which was greased and over priced for the portion I received.  Ere are much better West Indian places a little further west and on Queen.   I am still surprised that this place is still around for the size of the restaurant it is never full."}
{"text":"One of my fav Parkdale food spots.  I have been going to Island Foods on and off for the past 5 years, and I have never had a bad experience. Granted, sometimes it does take longer then I want to get the food, but that is just me being impatient.  On my last trip, we ordered the ox tail, jerk chicken, curry chicken roti and doubles. My friend had never had doubles, so I order extras, then ate them all (sorry Peter!). All the food was amazing, as it usually is. Even the next day as leftovers.  Side note: You see the coolest people in this rather large restaurant. Great place to sit and watch while you eat,  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good food but like freaking slow service. Expect to wait 30-40 minutes in line for what looks like no reason, it's island time I'm guessing"}
{"text":"Was visiting for the weekend so I searched Yelp for some places to grab a bite. The restaurant is the queen west neighborhood. Prices are reasonable. Considering most of the food Is already prepared the wait for Carry out is too long !!! The rice and peas was meh. The chicken was ok. I live in Brooklyn NY so I'm used to some good Caribbean food. This was just ok."}
{"text":"I hate to do this, I really do.   But I'm hoping a less than great review might inspire some change.   First thing's first, it is no secret their roti's are to die for. Island Foods nails the roti; and roti's are GREAT!   But what I like even more than roti's are DOUBLES - a delicacy of chickpea goodness that I was introduced to about 2 months ago. I've been looking for good doubles in the city ever since. I figured Island Foods would have been a safe bet on account of their roti being fantastic. I checked online and was delighted to find doubles on the menu. I went last week to pick up a whole bunch - at least 6 so I could freeze and reheat for lunches. I waited in line for about 10 minutes to get to the front and be told they were all out. It was disappointing but I chalked it up to bad luck.   Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. I went back again this evening and again, no doubles. I was told (albeit very politely) that they didn't make them as they had been so busy making roti this evening. I can appreciate that but if you are running out of ingredients, or can't be bothered to make them, I would suggest taking them off the menu so your customers will know to go elsewhere, or perhaps purchase more ingredients or hire more staff so you are able to serve what is on your menu.  Maybe I'll try again in another 6 months time."}
{"text":"Still awesome, and still there. The owner says they will be gone by the end of the month, however. Since my last review I've tried the doubles and a couple other rotis - shrimp and beef, they're all reliable! I've heard tell however of mystically hot doubles, and these were not all that spicy. The quest for the truly firey doubles continues..."}
{"text":"There is an Island Foods in my 'hood (King Street W/Dufferin) and I love their chicken rotis.  Stacey, my colleague, also likes their rotis so we've been trying to figure out how to get there for lunch.   She and I had a meeting this afternoon in Concord and she suggested that we have lunch along the way at Island Foods at their Don Mills Road location.  I didn't know they had a Don Mills Road location ... whoohoo!  We both ordered chicken rotis with \"gravy\" on top.  It tasted a little different than the ones I've had at their other location (a stronger curry flavour) and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I had supper this evening at Island Foods, which is in my 'hood.   I've been a fan of theirs since I moved to Toronto over 30 years ago and have been many many times.  I got what I always get ... a boneless chicken roti.  I don't think I've ever ordered anything else from them as I love their rotis!  And it was delicious as usual."}
{"text":"Juicy, spicy, flavourful rotis with a variety of options for fillings. Add-ons can make the price creep up and I hear so many people (me included) ordering a boneless chicken roti with spinach it might as well be on the menu. The extras - plantain chips, grapefruit soda, dboules and patties, might make this place a good stop for a snack too. But be warned... they suffer from THE SLOWNESS.  I've walked up to the door, seen a line-up of more than 2 or 3 people, and done a U-turn. If they have more than a few people in the service slows to a crawl. Sometimes the cashier gets busy and takes a while processing orders. Other times you'll order and pay promptly, only to realize that there might be a dozen orders queued up ahead of you. Since you order from someone not in the prep area, you don't ever hear, \"Oh we're waiting on more chicken. Would you like something else instead?\" You make your order and it gets passed to the prep area and if they're making a new batch of curried chicken or potatos or heaven forbid waiting on rotis to come out of the back kitchen your only option is to sit and wait.   Speaking of sitting and waiting, that seems to be what most of the seating is for. There is a lot of seating here, with two rooms, but considering how long service takes I can't image the whole place full of customers all eating at once. On any given night half the seated customers are people simply waiting for their take-out orders.  I've even tried calling ahead in hopes of being able to swing by and grab my dinner quickly only to have them not even start working on my roti until I came in the door and paid up. Another attempt to order ahead proved fruitless because the wait to even get to the cashier was so long. Not cool.   Don't get me wrong. I enjoy getting dinner from here. But if you're in any kind of hurry at all, or on a tight schedule, don't bother."}
{"text":"Ever since I was a kid I was coming to an Island Foods, sure the locations change, and there are a few more of them now but it's always the same, friendly people simple cooking and great flavors. Most of the locations are pretty sparse on ambience or have any of the frills of the more modern resto-pub scene but you don't need any of that when the foods so good.  The line up here is probably the most frustrating from 12pm-2pm and 5pm-7pm the line is pretty damn long but it's not as bad as some other places, there has never been a time where I waited more than 15 minutes in total for anything here. I know most of these storefronts have haven't been updated in a while, but considering what the price point is it's a non issue. At this point it's even cheaper than Mc Donalds/KFC."}
{"text":"Best Roti. Ever. Chicken meat and Tamarind balls! Great hangover cure too! Theyre not opened on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Legitimately the best Caribbean roti I've had in Toronto. I honestly don't eat too much Caribbean food so I can't tell you if it's authentic stuff but I can tell you that their boneless goat roti is fantastic. Lots of flavours, always fresh, and most of all the roti has a great texture and taste to it. Other places I've tried, the roti was way too powdery and lacked flavour--not the case with Island Foods.   Competitive pricing, a little on the more expensive side for lunches but it's a solid treat.   I highly recommend this place if you're into roti. Their beef patties are nice and flakey too. Double are soft, a little greasy, not my thing.    Fun fact: after eating their food your BO will definitely smell like curry for the next two days."}
{"text":"Awesome service, these guys are quick and so pleasant! Took our goat and jerk chicken dinners to go. Love it"}
{"text":"Good, consistent island food. Beef patties are great. Usually get the Jerk Chicken, never disappoints."}
{"text":"It's fast food casual and strictly a take-out place for me. If there is a lineup, the wait can be torture. Still I think the chicken roti is among the best in the city. Fresh, tasty and the spiciness is spot on."}
{"text":"The best roti! Family run business who always make you feel welcome. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that I work close to this place! They have the best roti that I've ever had, (not that I'm some connaiseur). They give a great portion that's not too big so that you're super full, and use all nice quality white chicken meat. Their shells are also fresh made and make all the difference. So tasty!! I want one right now :) To top it off, their very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken roti and jerk chicken dinner. Great portions! Regularly swing by this place for lunch with my Co workers."}
{"text":"If you're craving West Indian style Roti, Island Foods is a decent spot to go. Good spot for lunch crowd if you're around the Liberty Village area.   If you do eat here, stick with the Roti.  Boneless goat Roti with extra gravy on top is my go-to pick every time. It's consistently good, and basically the only thing I get now. Boneless chicken Roti is a good recommendation too if I ever go with others.   Oxtail has disappointed me on countless occasions. It's like it's been over-stewed and all you're left with is bones and gravy.   Not the best in town, but it holds it's own."}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I can count. The staff is always friendly and fun, the food has never disappointed, and the restaurant is always clean.  Hands-down the best roti I've ever had anywhere. My favorites are the spinach and channa rotis, but my wife always gets the boneless chicken rotis.  I'll never get board of eating here, and I'm willing to bet neither will you!"}
{"text":"I use to come to Island Foods a lot when I worked in the area but haven't been back since I left.  We decided to check it out for a quick bite before a Yelp event in the area.  Even though Island Foods is probably considered fast food, there really isn't anything fast about the experience.  As we stood in the line to order, I had a flashback to times when I would spend my entire lunch break in line to order and then scarfing down the food at my desk.  Tonight, it took about 15 minutes just to get to the cash to order with only 3 people ahead of us.  The staff was busy packing up large take out orders.  We place an order for the boneless chicken roti ($6.95) and then waited for the roti to be assembled very, very slowly.  The food here is good.  Our roti was flavourful and hot.  The boneless chicken chunks were tender.  I've also had the ox tail dinner ($8.95) in the past and it's good as well.  The service at Island Foods is on island time so if you need to get in and out quickly, it's probably not the best option."}
{"text":"I have just moved out of the country and I am going to miss Island Foods immensely. I also saw that there is a condo developer what is planning on changing the entire block. If that happens I hope Island Foods finds a new home in Parkdale. It will be one of my first food stops when I come back to Toronto. So EVERYONE eat as much jerk chicken and eggplant roti as humanly possible!"}
{"text":"OMG their doubles mmmmmm. Had a boneless curry chicken roti as well and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place and have developed a slight addiction to boneless chicken rotis with spinach and extra hot. The extra hot I get is with their pepper paste and holy crap is it hot but soooooo good. Busier than hell at lunch so if you're planning to go, go before noon or after 1pm.   I've been searching for the best roti and so far this is my personal fav!!! Weeks just aren't the same when I don't get to put one of these in my belly"}
{"text":"Really awesome roti here. Big, filling, and delicious. I highly recommend the boneless chicken roti as it is tops. The people are very friendly here.  I would say avoid this place like the plague during busy hours such as weekday lunch. The lineups are massive and the service becomes extremely slow. It's damn good roti, but it ain't that good."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum.... Been here twice...Had the chicken (with bone) and it was absolutely delicious.  I think the Roti is cooked perfectly....Although, I went yesterday and had the Spinach (do not recommend it).  My bf had the channa.  I'm still goign to give it a 5 bc its so darn delicious.  Next time, I'm getting the vegetable.  I heard the spices were pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. We got the Jerk Chicken dinner. Delicous.  Unfortunately they close at 8pm, but you can always get take-out. The place feels like a fast-food joint anyway as you order in the back and there are seats in the front. Private parking in the back.   I wanted the dark meat but they gave me the white meat without asking. A little drier, but spicily delicious. I'm soooo glad we came here!!"}
{"text":"I've never had a rotis but this thing was damn good. It was a flavor explosion inside a flat bread gift-wrapped pillow. Really good. The restaurant itself was basic but looked clean. The service was a bit slow which created a line to the door."}
{"text":"maybe the 2nd best beef patty i've ever had (1st was a convenience store on Queen & Bathurst back in the early 90s when i was a kid) island foods patties brings back old memories of walking to school and picking up beef patties with the little red dot on them in one of those mini oven displays sitting on the counter next to the scratch & win tickets. they were so crispy on the outside and juicy filling on the inside. its always busy at this place but the line moves fast and the staff are friendly. The goat roti was very delicious too! lovely eatery in the dufferin and king area"}
{"text":"My break time at work is dwindling by the minute, but sadly my appetite is not!    The solutions?!  Doubles!   At $1.30 each, the Doubles at Island Foods are great and my new favourite snack. Yum :-)"}
{"text":"Finally I got to try the Island Food. I cant believe I never looked around my eighborhood for good eats.   great food! I had their famous boneless chicken roti. It had lived up to its reputation around Liberty Village for deliciousness. the boneless chicken inside was jucy and tender unlike other rotis I had have in the past had dry dense fillings. The rotis here are much jucier. So it could be messy. I tried to pick it up to eat it, it was leaking everywhere over my palm out of control mess! I'd hate to have people see me licking my hand it would look so rude although it wouldnt have been that bad in some cultures for hand licking. But I am Chinese, we gonna have some manners!! Luckily I order it \"for here\", and was about to pick up knife n fork to kill the rest of roti piece by piece without making such mess.   My companion picked jerk chicken(no bone) The chicken came boneless so it looked much smaller than else where, but I think its still a lot of chicken. Their beef patties were great too. They were bigger and thicker, definitely home made!   The place had people lining up some point and it was getting buzy even little after dinner hour. I can see the place being packed during lunch time. So if you do go, go early and try to eat there so wont make huge mess at desk. I looked over, everyone else at their table was eating roti as well. Their roti must be famous. I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Hot and muggy day! Great to have some Caribbean/West Indies Food that make me feels like I am on one of the Islands dipping in the turquoise ocean...  X Hot! I screamed when I ordered my Goat Roti. How is XHot achieved? not by extra spices but just adding Xhot sauce, maybe I could have done it myself.  Goat was quite tender.. Roti is thin and not too doughy...  Just wish my Cola Champagne is really champagne...  Just wish I am really eating some food on an Island...  Just wish me and my lunch date are both in bathing suit by the pool...  Then he woke me up by making me eat this doughy Beef patty... Just wish my patty is flaky..."}
{"text":"For some reason, I haven't eaten a lot of roti in my life. I really can't explain why that is -- it's just something I had once at a mediocre place, kinda liked it, and forgot about.  But after Island Foods, I don't think it's possible for me to forget about roti. Holy crap, this place is so so so good. We waited in a lineup for the food as my stomach began to eat itself because it smelled so delicious inside. And as much as I hate waiting, it was so definitely worth it.  The good thing about Island Foods' roti is that they offer chicken roti using only white meat. Not to mention the delicious sauce and potatoes and the delicious channa roti with chickpeas from heaven...Literally my mouth is watering while writing this review.   It's awesome, and it's cheap. Island Foods' rotis range from $4.50 to $7.00, which is really reasonable since I've been told other places can go upwards of $12 for the same size roti.  If you're ever in the area, stop by -- they have a bunch of dinner options that looked delicious as well, and even if there's a lineup, service is fast enough that you can run in and out to get your roti fix."}
{"text":"Ho Ho Ho!! My body craves island food..  I am a huge fan of the Channa roti myself and it is brilliant! My belly does a wee little dance of happiness once its inside..  The veggie patties are soo good and so are the beef.  I have heard that the chicken roti is good but i have not tried it - but friends say that they rule..and when they are eating them they are wiggling in there seats = so its got to be good!"}
{"text":"Cheap, tasty roti. My favourite is the boneless chicken breast but the goat is good too. It's exactly what I expected and the service is a bit friendlier than the other location. Oh and when they say \"hot\" they mean HOT; add sauce at your own risk."}
{"text":"Not only was the curry gravy I ordered on the side cold and the shrimp in my roti extremely over cooked (the shrimp was mushy) I asked for extra pepper. I swear they put the entire pepper bottle in my roti. I was extremely over powering, it was so damn hot I could not even finish it and had to throw it in the garbage. I called to inform her of my experience and she debated with me telling me that, this is how the extra spicy is (I am a foodie and can handle my spice. this was WAY TOO HOT) she continued to argue with me and said \"I don't know what you want me to do\". The poor customer service I got from this restaurant would have me rating this joint a 150. The food was gross and mushy plus they have no idea how to make an upset customer happy at all. good bye to this place!!!!"}
{"text":"This is great place for lunch, but be sure to get there before the lunch crowd as the lines and wait could get very long (lines out the door). Their roti is their main draw and everything is made to order, which is why there is more of a wait. I suggest getting there before 11:45am or else you could be waiting for more than 30 minutes for your lunch.  I often get the boneless goat roti, which is like a poor man's lamb but still rich in flavour, and I always ask them to make it extra spicy. I love the amount of heat which you could actually feel but not overpower and you could almost feel the sweat on your brow.  When you dine in they give you actual cutlery, not plastic, though I do find the Styrofoam plates like scratching a chalkboard when you dig your cutlery into them. I also like the assortment of Carribean beverages, like Ting and various tropical fruit sodas."}
{"text":"I dunno what all the fuss is about.... but first, a disclaimer:  - I've never eaten a roti before going to Island Foods - My expectations were very high given the 4.5 Yelp rating.  I give this a weak 3.  That may reflect my somewhat unrealistic expectations.  I order the boneless chicken roti (with \"a little\" hot sauce. and a diet pepsi which comes in at about $9.00 including tax. Pluses - roti was nicely spicy, sauce was a little oily but tasty. Minus - roti \"wrapper\" was I guess bread that seemed to have the consistency more like a pancake/crepe.  Limited chicken, potato portions contained in the roti.  Overall, I guess I basically wondered why I was eating here instead of having a beef empanada at Jumbo Empanadas.  I could afford almost two empanadas for the price of one chicken roti.  I wish I'd ordered the chicken dinner pictured below as I write that review - I think I would have enjoyed that more than the roti.  Bathrooms had a silly layout.  You couldn't use the hand dryer without someone being able to open the bathroom door right into you.  There was a sign saying \"Try our other location\".  Of course, no mention of where that location is... no matter, I wouldn't go out of my way to go to it."}
{"text":"Seriously, I didnt even check the review before i went there as i thought it can't be bad. i've been to lots Caribbean restaurants in gta and i usually like the food. BUT THIS ONE YOU SHOULD AVOID.  I ordered jerk chicken dinner. The jerk chicken was waterly which I found weird. I'd only had half of the dish and shortly after I HAD ONE OF THE WORST FOOD POISONING IN MY LIFE. I had to cancel my plan for the day and went back home to rest. I don't understand why it had good review here. If you dont want to feek sick, don't ever eat there. You are better off starving."}
{"text":"Decent Caribbean food if you're craving and there isn't anywhere else to go. More Trinidadian than anything else. The vegetarian options are varied though they sit for awhile in heating pans. Roti is well-made and doesn't fall apart like at some other joints. Fillings are a bit watery and tame, but tasty enough. The lineups are long at meal times, and the service takes its own sweet time but they are really friendly and remember your order. I come here regularly as their isn't a ton of good options in the area."}
{"text":"I don't eat anything here other than the beef patties (which that don't make). But really good patties they are.   Won't eat the roti here since I know of roti hut. No comparison."}
{"text":"Island Foods is one of my fave cheap eats in Parkdale. Delicious, spicy Caribbean goodness. Do yourself a favour, don't judge a book by it's cover and enjoy the spicy beef patty or a boneless chicken roti."}
{"text":"This place was just ok for me. We had recommendation from your guide and went out of our way to give it a try. The line was out the door at about 12:30 on a Thursday which made me excited that it was as good as our guide had said. Hubby had the jerk chicken which was good but not great. I had the goat roti and my goat was quite tough. The roti was nice but wish my meat had been more tender."}
{"text":"On my jerk hunt, I stumbled on this resto. I also heard they serve good rotis!! So I checked it out tonight. Surprisingly, they have quite a lot to choose from on the menu, for a jerk place.   My buddy and I ordered a goat roti (YUMZA!!) and an oxtail dinner (I've had better). Not a fancy resto, but it's not a hole in the wall, like some places..... (dont get me wrong, I have nothing against hole in the walls!!) Prices are reasonable. Food served with a smile. Lots of drink options. Will definitely return to try other stuff!!"}
{"text":"I love the porridge here... If youre interested in a fast and delicious porridge this is where to go."}
{"text":"I've been going to Island Foods for their Roti for quite sometime - including the original location for this one at Eglinton and Mount Pleasant.  The other one is on King and Dufferin. This biz is run by a lovely wife and husband team - and sometimes their daughter is helping out.  Truly a family run biz making meals using their family recipes. The place is out of my way but when I do end up running around nearby, I make it a note to drop by and get my hunger satisfied. Everyone has a favourite place and though I have not been to a lot of West Indies places, this is my favourite from those I have experienced. My fav is the chicken breast roti.  They have generous portions of chicken and potatoes in a nice thin roti.  If you like it spicy, they can make it to whatever you think your tastebuds can handle.  I like mine hot and they make it HOT!  Sometimes a little over the top!  My fault - where the heck is my Pepcid! If I have the time to dine in, I get extra curry ladled on top of my roti.  Bonus!  What a treat!  I don't do it for takeout as it makes the meal way too soggy. Their beef patties are also pretty good.  Lots of meat but I would like a bit more gravy inside as I find it dry sometimes. If you want something different than your usual burgers and fries, or tasteless noodles, give this a try! Cheers!"}
{"text":"One of the best curry based Roti's in the city.  Really good portion sizes, lots of chicken and the 'hot' option has a really nice kick to it.   The shop appears to be family run and is super clean and professional.    No credit so make sure you bring debit or cash."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The chicken Roti's are hella good. Go for the boneless ones though and get a side of rice with gravy too."}
