{"text":"The food here is excellent. Great prices and they're pretty generous with the amount of food.  Service here isn't always the best, but that's pretty typical of Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"So Disappointed about the waiter here, when he required me to give 10% minimun for tip. Never come back"}
{"text":"I've definitely had better ramen elsewhere,  but it's good enough to satisfy that ramen craving. We ordered the tonkotsu and the king of kings. The tonkotsu wasn't great -- broth was not hot..waaayyyy too much beansprouts, and the pork slices were dry (could have been zapped in the microwave ). The King of Kings was a tad better. It came out piping hot and the broth was more flavourful..but again...waaayyyy too much bean sprouts!  Would come back again, though..they could have just been having an off day. But...for the Kenzo chain that's known for their tonkotsu broth, I was quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Kenzo! I finally have been to Kenzo noodle, and also in one week went to two different location , one on Yonge, other one on Bloor. I like the one on Yonge better.  we had king of king ramen. the ramen was so yummy and  spicy. the \"chasu\" (BBQ pork) and noodle are tender and chewy. specially the grilled mark chasu ,not too dry and gave u a miso soup flavour.  The dumpling was juicy and the skin very thin.  Overall good value for the quality.  The store is small, maybe 10 to 13 tables but I feel its good Japanese family restaurant even though its owned by Korean people.  Don't park at the front... suggest you park at the back... less traffic."}
{"text":"Okay food, no service at all. No refills on tea and they leave your empty bowls on the table without taking it away"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a weeknight.  This place is better than aijisan ramen, but still doesn't sit at the top of my ramen list.     The broth is just ok, the noodles are cooked well, but nothing special.  I tried the Takoyaki (octopus, wheat & tempura scraps formed into balls) and wasn't impressed either. The balls looked pretty, but taste...not that great. I've had the real thing in Japan and these were a far cry from that. First, there was too much breading to octopus ratio.   Second, the breading had this weird aftertaste that reminded me of banana flavoring.  Third, the octopus portion...I had 1 little octopus piece in each ball.    All in all, not my favorite place, but I didn't get sick  from the food either."}
{"text":"The noodles were great -- very fresh, and the soup was quite good. Don't expect a ton of variety, but what they do they seem to do quite well. And at a surprisingly cheap price for what you get. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Very good noodle at a reasonable price. Kids friendly place with high chairs and apple juice instead of water for kids."}
{"text":"Food was good quality! They seemed to be short staffed (there was one waitress serving 5 different tables) and the atmosphere wasn't as comfortable as I would've liked but I enjoyed the food nonetheless. I'd like to think it was just one of those off-days for the restaurant.  I'd like to go back and try again when I'm craving ramen!"}
{"text":"food: its fairly good better then average ramen, i think its the best is that area so with your looking for ramen definitely give this one a try! I've had a few different ramens there now and they were all pretty good.  the eggs that come in the ramen are perfectly cooked every time!    the service is always good there and the price is pretty average nothing too expensive like 10 - 15 bucks a ramen."}
{"text":"Went there on a friday afternoon for lunch as a friend recommended it as a authentic ramen place.  Truthfully I dont think he or I know what authentic ramen is because the only other ramen he and I tried is Ajisen and the instant type you buy at the groceries.  And now to the review.    What I ordered: King of Kings Ramen Price: $11.49  First of the ambience was nice and decor was decent.  Not an upscale place but not a hole in the wall either.  The service staff was friendly but one think I wasn't appreciative is that my order actually had options on it and I was not told of the options.  I only found out when I heard another waiter next to me take someone elses order.  Apparently i can choose how spicy and whether i wanted pork or chicken.  First fail!    Now for the food.  It was a huge bowl.  My dish was a broth based ramen mixed with pork, seaweed, bean sprouts, and ground pork.  The broth was pretty good.  Salty but not overly, and spicy wise had some kick. the noodles were the yellow type that chinese use to for chow mein; which isn't my fav type but i thought the texture was fine as it was chewy but yet soft and not mushy.  The best part of the meal was the pork.  It was flavourful with a touch of sweetness.  The texture was soft but not mushy and melts in your mouth.  The ground pork was ok.  I tasted some herbs in there but nothing that jumped out at me.  About the only negative that stuck out to me is the size of the dish.  You better be hungry as they only have one size and it aint small.    So overall i though the experience and food was decent and I'd definitely go back again.  They could improve on their service and maybe offer different sizes for those who can't eat as much.  Price wise it was fair value for the money in my books.  Definitely worth a try if you looking for authtentic Ramen, and so we think."}
{"text":"Best Ramen place in the downtown core. Their sizzling noodles is a must try. Staff are always friendly & helpful. Authentic Japanese street food that's always a delight."}
{"text":"food okay, service horrible. waited over half an hour to get food at 2:00 in the afternoon"}
{"text":"So very yummy!  This is a perfect place to warm up with some no nonsense flavorful warmth.  Best of all it's only a few minutes walk from the Novotel Hotel and one of the option nearby options that isn't in a mall.  There's no need for room service with this place so close by.  Definitely try the spicy garlic pork ramen option!"}
{"text":"Not the best ramen I've ever had. I got the Tonkatsu bowl. Noodles were great, broth was not bad. My friend and I ordered a side of dumplings to go with our ramen and it turned out crisp and tasty. Nice atmosphere though the servers were a bit...aloof.   Pricing could be better. For what you get I don't feel the high tag is worth it. I must say that the food comes fast though.   I'm not sure if I would go back. I'm on a quest to find the best ramen place in Toronto. I suppose I'll try others first before thinking of returning here. So far, I've had better and this wouldn't rank in my top three."}
{"text":"So good! I had... Sorry, can't remember the name now, but it was the one at the top of the middle page (the section with the spicy broths. Chicken and stir-fried veggies in a moderately spicy red broth.   It was the broth that was so amazing - incredibly flavourful! I suppose it could have done with more variety of vegetables, but really, with broth that good, and a huge serving size, there's really not much to complain about.   I'll definitely be back to try other dishes..."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  Koreans making Japanese noodles.  You'd think they'd have a better hang of the noodles.  The spicy noodles are just overly spicy over powering the taste with just the spices and doesn't enhance the flavour of the noodles and broth.  Other dishes I've tried here also are extremely starchy and the noodles were too soft and overdone rather than being firm and chewy.  If a noodle house can't even boil the right consistency of the noodles it's an epic fail.  Would never go back to this place again for their unappetizing noodles that was overcooked, overly starchy broth, off balance of spices.  They try to mask the bad broth with MSG.  One word: garbage."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best ramen I've had in GTA so far. Adequate portion sizes, amazing Tonkatsu broth & noodles. We went on a friday night @ the end of november and it was completely packed. Had to stand and wait a good ~15 minutes before we were seated but it was worth it in the end.  Don't confuse this with the other Kenzo ramen which is franchised & therefore lower quality."}
{"text":"Heard lots of good reviews about this place but was disappointed. We went on a friday night and more than half of the restaurant was empty, not a good sign.  I ordered the Seafood Champion tonkatsu ramen which included Mussels, Prawns, scallops & squid. The mussels were tender but they smelled not so fresh and there was SAND in 2 of them! Half of the squid pieces were inedible because it was impossible to chew. The noodles & broth were decent, but I've had better.  My GF ordered the Tonkatsu Miso ramen and the portion size was really small, about 60% the size of my order. There were only 3 pork slices & 2 of them were tough as jerky.   Never coming back again.  There is another Kenzo ramen further north on Yonge Street near steeles that is 2x better and not a part of this franchise."}
{"text":"Went there on a quiet weekday afternoon for lunch. The ramen was just okay, nothing to write home about, however, the service was dismal. Our waitress seems to be in a crappy mood, you can't squeeze a smile from her, in fact, it seems that she is mad, I mean MAD.  Anyway, given the poor service, I will not go back."}
{"text":"I have an undeniable appetite for bean sprouts. I don't know what it is, but I just love the crunch and texture of those little guys. While some would call it a chintzy way to \"beef\" up a meal, I actually quite enjoy it when my meal is full of sprouts and other texturey vegetables- and I can be rest assured that the Netsu Ramen at Kenzo will satisfy my needs. I'm quite certain this dish's description even states \"loaded with stir fried vegetables,\" yes-freaking-please. The noodles itself aren't too special, tastes like standard boiled ramen noodles. The service at this Sheppard location is quite attentive, always coming by to refill your water and keeping up with greetings. Probably one of my favourite ramen places in the area."}
{"text":"The salmon onigiri is amazing. Quitr inexpensive as well. I could actually just eat the onigiri for my entire meal."}
{"text":"I always love going to Kenzo. I actually prefer this location to the Mississauga one. I get Netsu ramen a lot and it's always good. The quality of the dishes are very consistent so I know I always get a full meal. I feel extremely satisfied after eating all the ramen. Anything you get here is good. I definitely recommend this place and location."}
{"text":"For noodle places, this one is amazing because all of their soups taste different. I like it."}
{"text":"I was ecstatic when I learned that a Kenzo's was opening up in my area! It's a lot better than Aji Sen, in my opinion. I have made 3 visits here to get my quick ramen fix whenever I'm in need of one.  So far, I have had the Sho-Yu Ramen and the Tonkotsu Ramen as my main staples. My father, who enjoys spicy ramen, ordered the Netsu Ramen when we went for dinner. We have also tried the Takoyaki as well. The meat in each dish is so tender that it melts in your mouth - it's really heavenly. I thought that it was very dry at first from its appearance, but I couldn't have been anymore wrong. The broth was light and flavorful, the noodles were perfect, and the bamboo shoots were oh so tender. The takoyaki was very milky in the middle with a distinct octopus flavor. It was nice to have as an appetizer; however, I would probably not order it again. I definitely recommend the Sho-Yu Ramen for a less expensive, filling, and tasty meal! (:"}
{"text":"Food here is amazing. The prices are reasonable and the amount of food they give you is decent. I would recommend to try all the different kinds of ramen here along with the takoyaki. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"What happened to all of Kenzo's reviews?? I wrote one awhile ago and yelp deleted? Anyhoo this is by far my fav ramen place in the city. Not to be confused with \"Kenzo\" the ramen chain by the same name that is downtown and near Yonge and shep. This shop is a small mom & pop that serves absolutely delicious food!! My personal favourite is their spicy orachang ramen AND it comes with a sweet pickled radish side dish for free if you ask. The chasu side dish, kalbi & tonkasu are also fantastic."}
{"text":"The spicy ramen with porn bone soup (2 spice levels) is the spiciest thing you have ever tasted!! You will not be able to finish the bowl, but if you like spicy food...it's highly recommended!!!   Great spot"}
{"text":"My first exposure to ramen was the dry msg ladden instant noodle packages.. Mr. Noodle and I go wayy back :)   but later in my school days I discovered it wasn't just that. Ramen can eat like a meal. It was the best low cost staple a student can have to save money.  Much later in life did I find out that there are entire shops dedicated to this soup craft. Even a movie which I got a kick out of called Ramen Girl, starring Brittany Murphy delved into this art of making soup.   Ok when I'm hungry,  soup isn't the first thing that comes to mind. So rarely  when I do go out to eat do I choose soup. I have to either have a craving to eat soup (rarely) or I feel like I'm coming down with a cold (likely).  Off the top of my head I've only been to a few places; Takebashi in Commerce Gate in Markham, Ajisen Ramen on Spadina and on Yonge St. North York,  Cattle Cafe in Richmond, BC and now Kenzo in North York.   The biggest difference I find between the places is the quality of the noodle and ingredients. The broth at all places were are all pretty good and tasted as described.   Alright enough background and onto my experience at Kenzo..   When I got there I was fortunate to find parking in the front of the shop (from reading some reviews it's hard to park). I sat at a small round table for two and looked at this well worn paper menu. Not feeling experimental that day, I ordered the Basic Ramen. It's called Sho-Yo Ramen - Super Noodles with Japanese Soy Sauce.   About 6 minutes later it was brought out to me -- steaming, presented on a black wooden tray.   Yes it's a bowl of soup, but it isn't no frills though - it comes with fresh seaweed, a slice of turnip, half an egg, and few pieces beef. On the side some ginger and pickle.  Also brought to the table is red and white pepper. My favorite is the red hemp pepper.    My take,   Look - the broth is salt flavoured soup, with a hint of soy.. a good neutral stock. the yellow egg based noodles are just slightly bigger than the wavy noodles ones has in an instant noodle package.   Aroma - breathe in the salt and seaweed, you can readily exfoliate your face with the steam. :)    Taste - noodles cooked with the right amount of chewiness, it soaks the flavours of the soup base nicely, beef was ample, it was very tender in the soup, the half egg cooked about right and not over done.   It was an excellent bowl of ramen.   The interior of the restaurant -- a kind of narrow hallway feeling, the dark wood interior doesn't help, there's some Japanese beer paraphernalia about.. Half the restaurant are booths, half open tables. At the rear of the restaurant where the kitchen is located there's a huge counter the servers use to prepare the ramen.   Anyways, I'd come back here if I'm in the mood for soup again. The basic ramen was excellent. Next time I'd try something else perhaps with the miso based stock."}
{"text":"Lunch was great! Very friendly service, delicious (huge portions!) of ramen, and yummy takoyaki. The place was very clean and food was served promptly."}
{"text":"I went here last Sunday with my family, they loved it and so do I. My son has been begging me to come here again, and it's worth it. This is a favorite new ramen places, thought I wish they had vegetarian options"}
{"text":"I tried many restaurant in Toronto, this was one of the worst in terms of service. The bill comes to $34.86, I gave her $40  then she walk to the cash register after that she shout to me from the register.....do you need change? I usually give 15% to the server but this one don't deserved any. She never said Thank you when she gave me the bill or the changes.The Food was acceptable but not great. Overall, don't waste your money in this restaurant."}
{"text":"We are crazy about all kinds of noodles and ramen. We have tried EVERY place serve noodles near North York, and this is literally the worst. Oil floats on the soup and there are only cheap vegetables (cabbages, bean sprouts and green peppers) which are not supposed to be in any kind of ramen at all!! Tastes terrible I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"My favourite place for ramen. Vegetarian and vegan options Are available. For a vegan option I usually go for the vegetarian Sapporo miso ramen with vegetable broth $10.95. They do not use egg in the ramen noodles. They make their noodles in house. Which may be why their prices are a little higher than some other ramen places. The broth is rich and flavourful and the portions sizes are just right. I give 4 stars only because they charge the same price for the vegetarian ramen a with no meat as they do for the meat version. $11 for soup with noodles and veg is a little expensive. But yet I keep coming back cause it's that good :)"}
{"text":"These guys have one of the best Korean soups in town and for very reasonable price. They taste specially good on a cold winter day. The portion is also very big. I struggle to finish it in one sitting."}
{"text":"I was craving ramen on a Sunday and decided to give Kenzo Oakville another shot since Mississauga is closed on Sunday.  A few updates.. - the service is much better!! I didn't see any orders mistakenly go to the wrong table. I was seated immediately, had my order taken pretty quickly and was brought a glass of water immediately after I asked for it.  In addition to that, they checked up on me a few times after receiving my ramen.  - this time I only ordered a ramen. The quality and portion was significantly better than last time. The portion was on par with what I'm used to at Mississauga, and the chasu was very tender.  I didn't get any other foods or go during rush hour, however so far it seems like Kenzo Oakville really has improved sincerely their initial opening. This is great news! I love having another ramen option that doesn't require me to wait 30-40mins for a table.  I will definitely be trying some other options here in the future."}
{"text":"I would give this ZERO stars.  1 - they ran out of rice! WTF - how does that even happen?  2 - we decided to stay and order pot stickers.  They took the order, and then 30mins later they some how ran out of that too.  3 - 1hr later they said they were 'literally' plating our food.  Apparently literally has a different meaning in Japanese and it really means more 10mins later.  4 - they attempted to serve us, but it wasn't even the right table.  SMFH - WE LEFT WITHOUT GETTING OUR FOOD."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in the portion size of my ramen and the broth was very very salty.  I was excited to see that Oakville was getting another ramen place and thought it would be the same as the Kenzo in Mississauga but not so, too bad.  :(   The chicken karaage were tiny bits like popcorn chicken sized pieces and tasted a little burnt.   Mo's drunken chicken at Mye2 in Oakville is the gold standard of chicken karaage, there's no comparison!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been back here for a few years until tonight when we decided to give it another try.  Big disappointment.  The seafood ramen - noodles were clumped together, shrimps and squid were not fresh, broth was just mediocre.  The oyakodon (chicken egg on rice) - chicken was overly dry and bland, rice was not well seasoned.  Takoyaki - way too much sauce.  Won't be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Kenzo has always been consistent and ramen-slurpin' good since the first time I tried them.  Some dishes I always order: 1. King of King  Ramen - when you're craving something spicy and loaded with ingredients, this is a hearty bowl of noodles that will fill you up!  2. Tonkatsu Ramen - Pork bone flavoured, this is a smaller bowl of noodles with a creamy rich soup base. The pork is so tender, you don't really need to use your teeth.   3. Takoyaki - Generous pieces of octopus in every ball (six per serving) with the right amount of cheese. Be prepared to wait 20 minutes for this as it's made fresh.  The gyoza is A-OK, but not worth the price. Service is slow here, but the staff has always been very warm and friendly.   Out of all the ramen places that have opened recently in the GTA, this place is still my favourite!"}
{"text":"First off, this location is totally unrelated to the original Yonge and Steeles Kenzo. The waitress told us that the original owner sold the Yonge/Steeles location and opened with the same name at Sheppard, Wellesley, Dundas and Bloor. Strange that the menus are identical too.   I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen - $10.95 - and the broth is not as thick and creamy as I liked it to be. I asked for less salt, and it was significantly less salty than my friend's bowl. The pork was over cooked, but still tender. Maybe a little too much bean sprouts. The Yonge/Steeles location charges $13 for their Tonkatsu Ramen, and if you prefer creamier soup, I'd go there instead.   The interior of this location is chic and modern, and no wait time to be seated, which is rare for ramen places in Toronto. The service is friendly, and food arrived fast.   If you come here, you MUST order the gyoza! One of the best I've tasted in T-Dot! They're made fresh, so you'll need to wait 15-minutes. Totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My fave ramen place, hands down. Nothing beats the King of Kings. Broth is so savoury and rich, and all the toppings are just perfect. Tender pork..... super huge bowl but I always finish it and leave super bloated"}
{"text":"Tried the takoyaki at this restaurant... and it was OMGAMAZEBALLS. This is a must-order item, even though you get 6 for the price of $8.95.    They were made fresh and when they arrived it was: - large, perfectly round balls of delightful goodness - slightly crispy on the outside, soft & creamy on the inside - warm cheesy surprise with a little crunch from the octopus when chewing - isn't over-sauced yet as soon as you bite into it, the flavors all explode in your tongue, and all you taste is love  Some things I didn't like about the restaurant: parking at the front... most awkward and tight spots ever. Menu is old/battered and dispersed in the restaurant, unlike the other Kenzo establishments... for example, some of the items are found on the wall (takoyaki and a few other menu items was not listed on the menu but advertised on a piece of paper on the wall), place is also very old, small and cramped - you're sitting on wood rather than comfortable chairs."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Kenzo, and this is definitely the place to go if you love ramen! I love the broth and noodles they have here - it is actually flavorful (not just MSG and salt in water), have good portions for a reasonable price ($10-15 for their specialty ramens), and definitely nice place to sit at this location.   I would recommend getting their Tonkatsu (pork bone based broth) ramen. I tried the Tonkatsu sho-yu ramen which was $12 to fill me up and not spicy. Most people prefer the spicy ramen but I actually prefer this one as the broth is warm and tasty and sits well in my stomach after. It has decent proportions of toppings to ramen (half an egg, chasu, sliced green onion, and bean sprouts - which I opted out of), and for $2 you could add extra meat (which I got 'cause I was hungry and got double the meat slices, so it was worth it).  I would say avoid the miso and sho-yu ramen for $7 because their portions seem smaller and it's more generic... you might as well go for a more specialty ramen if you're in a ramen shop like this!"}
{"text":"We discovered Kenzo through Yelp. Delicious Gyoza, Tacomaki that melt in your mouth, and the ramen... complex, flavorful, delicious.   Only about 20-25 seats, but a quick execution and a high turnover means you shouldn't be afraid of a line.   Good prices and tasty food; solid neighborhood place."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm even giving them a 2 star vs 1 is because the food was actually very good!! In comparison to the other location in Mississauga, the food was quite good!  I'm a huge ramen fan so knowing that there's another location open near me AND open on Sundays is quite exciting! But I was quite disappointed!  I understand that they just opened last week and are getting into the hang of things but that's really no excuse. As a new business you should be prepared for anything and everything. In this case they were not!  I quickly realized after sitting down for 5 mins that the restaurant was full but about 95% of the tables had NO FOOD! I could hear tables complaining that they had been waiting for so long and wondered where their food was. The waitress was going around to each table apologizing and saying \"I'm so sorry but we just opened last week\"....  Again, no excuse. And it was clear that there was a lack of communication with both waitresses. They weren't letting each other know which tables have already ordered or those that were still waiting for water. It was kind of a disaster and felt a little bad for them.   My husband and I each ordered ramen and one appetizer, the chicken karaage. We originally wanted to order their gyozas but they didn't have any available yet...please don't put an item on your menu if you don't serve it.....! The appetizer arrived about 25-30 mins after ordering....I was ready to walk out after the app cuz I wasn't sure if I could wait any longer! Our ramen arrived 15-20 mins after that!   The food was excellent but if I have to wait 45-1 hour for my food, no thanks.  I hope that they are learning from their mistakes and will just get better from now on! I would really love it if I could keep coming back! Maybe I'll try again in a couple months."}
{"text":"This restaurant was where I had my very first ramen in Canada after I had done numerous research. Originally, Kenzo was owned by a lady who bought a ramen machine and cooked ramen in this restaurant. I believe I had not paid a visit for at least 4 to 5 years after it was sold to the present owner. Out of curiosity, I wanted to eat ramen at this restaurant tonight.   The menu was more or less similar to the one I read a few years ago but of course the prices were higher now. I ordered a bowl of tonkatsu miso ramen, a bowl of ramen with pork bone and miso soup base with 3 pieces of pork, a slice of fish cake, some veggies, half of a boiled egg, some corn chunks. It also came with a side dish of pickles.   I actually quite enjoyed the side dish of pickles. Even the tiny piece of carrot was cut in flowery shape. It's impressive. There's also a piece of red and green chillies on top of the pickles. The pickles were sour with a light sweet taste. It blended well with a bite of spicy chilly with it.   On the other hand, the bowl of ramen was a bit disappointing even though the size of the bowl was super big and the presentation of the noodle was attractive, every ingredient was arranged nicely on top of the ramen. The taste of pork bone and miso soup was not rich and the ramen was shredded. I supposed I was eating at a ramen shop but the ramen was not served properly. If the soul, the ramen, was not well, no need to comment on the rest of the ramen bowl. I don't think I would recommend this restaurant to my friend."}
{"text":"I know of only 2 Japanese ramen places in the GTA. Kenzo and Ajisen. I'd say Kenzo is definitely much better than Ajisen. It's not the best but it's not bad. I had a craving for tonkostu Ramen and this place made my day. I've had tonkotsu Ramen in Japan which was really awesome and obviously this aint as good. But after eating it you don't crave for it as much anymore.   I only order 3 types: tonkotsu, satporo and the king. All of them very satisfying in their own unique way.  if anyone knows of another ramen place I'd love to try it."}
{"text":"Food, location, and owner were all great! The black tonkotsu and karage hit the spot on a Sunday evening! Really thrilled to have this ramen option close to home and open every day. The only real opportunity is for the front of house to get a little quicker/more efficient."}
{"text":"The food is okay, the ramen I ordered was served very fast, but the service was just so so, as the waiter seemed to be so inactive and looked dead, as well as I received the bill soon after I just finished my meal and I didn't ask for it.  Note: the ramen is just average, disappointed as this is called \"ramen shop\", which it should be good at its ramen."}
{"text":"Kenzo is one of the best ramen places I been to so far.  It is a small restaurant (around 8 tables) that you probably won't even noticed when you drive down Yonge St.  There are limited parking up front but they have a larger lot on the back which is full of holes on the ground so watch out.  I come here pretty often and tried most of their items on the menu.  I like the Miso ramen and the King of King Ramen.  The Takoyaki balls are pretty good as well but a little expensive.  Rating:  Service: 4/5 Food Quality: 4/5 Comfort 3/5 Decor  3/5 Value: 3/5 Parking: 4/5"}
{"text":"We were really disappointed. And I don't want to give any star to this \"Noodle House\". We didn't experience any Japanese taste at all. We ordered Shouyu Ramen and Agedashi Tofu. The Ramen soup is very dark and too sweet!! I tasted their soup like a carton of chicken broth or powdered chicken broth.  Even ramen soup in Japan is almost clear, not black! I couldn't eat it up because of that sweetness. About Agedashi Tofu, the tofu dried up, and its soup was completely different from in Japan. Why they say \"Japanese Ramen House\"???  I was born and grew up in Japan. And I go back to Japan every year."}
{"text":"Love the Ramen at Kenzo, I never been to this location and I wasn't even aware it existed until I was walking by.  This place is a lot cleaner and modern than the original location.  Items on menu is the same and I got the usual Ramen.  The Broth is pretty good and noodles cooked well."}
{"text":"Quaint Ramen Establishment. The noodles were cooked to perfection and the stock perfectly balanced with flavour and salt. We ordered Sapporo Miso Ramen, tonkatsu lunch and gyoza. The tonkatsu lunch was huge (and yet we finished it.. And then some) and was very good.  If you have a ramen craving, this is a great place to go visit. Parking can be an issue but have some parking in the back."}
{"text":"Very authentic Ramen experience and don't miss the gyoza. They are very good. Not the cheapest Ramen place but the quality makes up for the price."}
{"text":"Great food and we knew it would be having been to their Mississauga location. This one is far more spacious and tables well spread out. However only 2 people taking care of 14 tables. They certainly dropped the ball on staffing needs"}
{"text":"Been here 2 times already and I really like this place!    Stopped by at 6PM on a Saturday and the restaurant was half full. I think there are about 14-15 tables in the establishment? Best for single eaters, couples, and groups with a max of 4 people because there aren't that many big tables.   Ordered the shio ramen both times! Perfect portion size for me, very filling and tasty. The broth was lovely and wasn't too salty. I haven't been to the Mississauga location that a few yelpers are comparing this place too, but I really enjoyed my meal.  I think this ramen is definitely worth the price, two bowls of ramen cost us around $25 (which is less than we usually spend eating out, esp in Oakville)   Docked one start because both times it took quite a bit for our food to come out. Also both times the restaurant seemed almost understaffed, maybe 2 waitresses serving 10+ tables."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Went in to buy a matcha iced tea and matcha smoothie for take out. We sat in a booth and waited for it arrive, and when it did, I was still on my phone and I told him I'll just be sitting for another minute, the one the staff rudely told me I could wait a minute by the door. Are you serious? Maybe if I didn't buy anything sure, but after spending $10 on drinks I think you could let me finish whatever I was doing on my phone. Their Ramen is mediocre at best as well. Do yourself a favour and go to Kinton Ramen down the road."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch.  I really liked their service, it was simply great.  Food was excellent, and met my apatite. Thanks Kenzo!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. I ordered the Netsu Ramen (Spicy Sapporo-style ramen with ground chicken and \"loads of stir fried vegetables.\"), asking for the top spicy level. As another commenter remarked, the bowl is dominated by bean sprouts, and the ground chicken must be still wandering on land because I did not see it in my soup. The noodles were also far from spectacular; they were a tangled mess (contending with the bean sprouts I suppose), and did not feel fresh or chewy. The spiciness and portion size were perhaps the only redeeming factors. Although, I have a sneaking suspicion that the generosity in portion was to compensate for the other low points.   To be fair, Kenzo is better known for its signature tonkotsu line of ramen, and I took a risk in ordering otherwise. May the odds (of better ramen) be in your f(L)avour!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their okonomiyaki. I should've shared it with people. This dish isn't great for just one person to eat. I kinda got tired of eating it in the end but it was super good."}
{"text":"Meh......I feel like I can make this at home  It's not disgusting, but it doesn't measure up to what the other Ramen places around Toronto are serving up.  It's nice that they do have more choices on the menu like having Takoyaki etc.   However, I'd say you might as well have a smaller menu and do what you do better...  I didn't have a great server either so that probably made my experience worse."}
{"text":"My local  favourite lunch. I love the ramen (Shoyu, pork and miso favour). Good prices, service little spotty, but great after the lunch rush.  Lots of regulars eating and drinking house special green tea latte."}
{"text":"Got the King Ramen, which was about $12. I like it... actually to me it seems like a cross between Ramen and Korean Soup... its a little spicy, and has a bunch of different ingredients (as well as the typical stuff, it has mushrooms, bean sprouts, carrots, etc). It's also pretty big. I saw that you can add a tonkatsu for $5, so I may do that next time for a little extra protein.   The restaurant is on the smaller size. It's on Yonge street near the Centrepoint Mall (a bit of a walk from Finch station).   I'll definitely be back when I feel like spicy non-traditional Ramen."}
{"text":"This restaurant is quite visible on the Yonge & Sheppard intersection. There is a giant mechanical statute with moving noodle outside the restaurant. You can't miss that!  Compared to Kinto Ramen, which is only 10min walking distance north from Kenzo, this restaurant is a lot more spacious. There is no waiting time, which can be positive if you need to get your food fast.  Kenzo has a decent number of selection on its menu. In terms of the menu, the difference between Kenzo and Kinton is that Kenzo pretty much doesn't allow you to customize their dish. This can be a good thing because it means they can make their default dish right.  I ordered Tonkotsu ramen, which is basically pork belly with a regular soup base. At first, the noodle that I ordered was firm (al dente). However, as I eat, the noodle quickly goes soggy. The pork belly wasn't as tender compared to Kinto, but that maybe because the meat at Kinto was mostly fat. In another way, this means that Kenzo may lead to a healthier alternative. All in all, this place is worth trying if you are around the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty average for me. We come here because the food is fast, the place relatively clean and there's always a table available. This place is similar to Ajisan for me except they have better soup and less MSG.   I've had their Tonkatsu Ramen before and I really found it average. Nothing really stood out to me at all. But I couldn't really say that it was bad. The only thing I didn't like was their noodles, I generally like the more chewy noodles while their noodles were a bit plain. I've also tried their rice dishes such as Oyakodon (Chicken and egg with rice), which was decent. Again just around average for me.   But the service is good, and you get quick food. Prices are reasonable. Will drop by for a quick bite."}
{"text":"So I don't care for ramen at all so my review is biased.  Came here once before and had the Ji Su Men (A soy sauce base soup combined with chicken, eggs and sesame oil. Mixed with stir fried vegetables.).  This was GROSS, the soup base was thick and i vowed to never return.  Came here again this past weekend against my will and had the Tonkotsu Ramen.  It was nothing spectacular.   The pork that it came with was really lean in comparison to other ramen places, which is good cuz its healthy but really we all know it tastes better when its a little fatty. The egg was good and that was about it.   However, we started with the Takoyaki (Baked octopus ball filled with octopus, green onion, cheese).  I don't like seafood but this was actually really good! There was only a midget size octopus in the middle but the outer ball area was so soft n tasty- not sure what it was though haha.  Also had the Tonkatsu (pork cutlet) on the side and this was REALLY well done.  The outside was perfectly crispy and the pork was super moist and tender on the inside.  Comes with a sauce that was also really good and a small side of salad.  I would come back just to eat the pork but NOT the ramen."}
{"text":"Okay, this place is close by, which is probably the only reason I still visit it rarely. The soup base is definitely average, if not subpar. Unfortuneately, I also get the same MSG dryness feeling in my mouth after I eat here. The noodles are okay, nothing special. The seaweed, scallions, and other vegetables do not taste fresh. However, one saving grace is that their meat is flavourful and tender.   The price point for basic shio and shoyu ramen is around $7. The larger sized/specialty ramens are around $12-15.   The service is okay, there is only one waiter. However, he does pour water and take your order promptly.   Overall, just like the McDonalds next door, I do not come here for the food, but only venture here for the convenience."}
{"text":"Not sure this would be my first pick for ramen in this area. It did the trick for satisfying my noodle craving but so many better options here. Let me elaborate.  Service 4/5 - when I came in for dinner around 7pm the place did not have any other customers. There were two staff servicing the tables. I was seated quickly and given the menu. I ordered the sho-yo ramen which comes with half a hot spring egg and two pieces of pork belly, controversy to the photo in the menu which showed three half eggs and four pieces of pork belly. I was fine with this false advertisement because the waitress had indicated what the bowl of noodles came with.   Taste and presentation 3/5 - the bowl of noodles came hot but presentation looked a bit lazy. The seaweed was soggy and soaked in the soup as opposed fresh and crispy on the side. There was no option to choose thick or thin noodles which I would have liked. The soup was a bit salty and full of msg.   Ambience 3/5 - the space is pretty big with 15 tables that could be grouped to seat two or four. I like the bench area and their attempt at making the place more of a ramen house feel. Some of the tables are a bit run down and need some TLC or touch-up. I was greeted with a strong winded smell coming into this restaurant, which doesn't make for a pleasant eating experience. It would be nice also if they chose a theme for their music as opposed to playing top 40s."}
{"text":"Good for a quick ramen fix.  One of the better ramen places in GTA.  The \"house special\" ramen is the one that comes in milky pork-bone broth.  Strangely it is not on the menu, but there is a picture of a huge bowl on the wall so just point and ask.  It comes with slices of tender chasu, marinated egg, and some veggie.  Quite tasty.  I've tried a few versions of their \"hot ramen\" too.   Pretty good.    Very small place, less than 10 tables.    Korean staff and chef.  This woman server is always in a rush, not rude or anything, but she's too busy to give you a smile."}
{"text":"A relatively small ramen joint with about 3 booths and 7-8 individual tables. When I entered around 2:20, the restaurant was empty other than my friends there. However, as we continued to eat, more people started coming in. Kenzo Ramen is located near Finch station so the location is very convenient. I am not completely sure if this place is authentic (I believe the owners are Korean but the food...)  I ordered the Netsu Ramen which according to their site is described as \"Spicy, Sapparo style ramen with ground pork meat and vegetables.\" The ramen was definitely not that spicy, just a tiny kick but the soup and everything was delicious. I loved the presentation of the ramen where it was placed on this ceramic rectangle plate with the ramen and the spoon. The ramen was amazing, the flavours were great and there was a perfect ratio of all the ingredients. I love ramen with well cooked bean sprouts and cabbage so I enjoyed the different textures too. The Netsu Ramen also came with half a hard boiled egg.  I would give Netsu Ramen a 5 star rating because of its cheap price and delicious food but service wasn't the great. But I would totally come back because of how yummy and affordable the ramen is!"}
{"text":"If u have been going to the Mississauga location, u will be disappointed with the quality of food here. Unfortunately they don't taste the same - the noodles are over cooked (taste like instant noodles) and the soup taste different than other location depending on what u ordered.  Hope they will provide consistent taste as other location in the future."}
{"text":"Solid Ramen experience. They must have heard about the slow service since the staff was super attentive tonight. Better than downtown Toronto Kenzo but maybe not quite as good as the Mississauga Kenzo. A bonus is no wait time here as the place is only 25% full."}
{"text":"Average place - I've definitely had better ramen elsewhere, but if you're at Yonge and Sheppard and craving ramen - wouldn't hurt to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Definitely, O-O-Oppa Gangam style!  Ok prices ($7-12) for ramen.  And some of the best Gyzoa I've had in the city.  Crispy, juicy and plump (which so many places seem to get wrong).  I had the spicy with pork, and it was omnomeriffic."}
{"text":"The noodle lover in me is super excited for Oakville to have its own ramen spot. Hooray x3! Overall, Kenzo has some great options for ramen and Japanese dishes. There's still lots of room for improvement in taste, service, and ambience but they are off to a great start and I will definitely be back to try some of their other options!   Taste: 3.5/5  My ultimate go-to ramen is always the Tonkotsu and every ramen shop has their own take on it so I was eager to see Kenzo Oakville's spin on the popular item. Priced at $13 with the option to add extra noodles at an additional cost, Kenzo Oakville's Tonkotsu wins big points - I absolutely loved the creaminess of the broth (much better than Kenzo Mississauga!). Where this dish fell short was in the char-su - it was a little too dry for my liking. I've been spoiled by char-su that practically melt in your mouth so this was a change. Not a lot of people like the creaminess or how filling the Tonkotsu is so another great option is the Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen. We also ordered the chicken, tuna, and salmon Onigiri ($3.50 for one). Unfortunately, they ran out of chicken so we only ended up with the tuna and salmon. This taste of this dish came up a little short for us. The tuna onigiri was paired with far too much black sesame seeds which overpowered the rice and tuna taste. I preferred the salmon onigiri much better. The rice for both onigiri came apart easily and made it pretty messy for us to eat though :( Still hoping to try the chicken onigiri next time! Lastly, we ordered the Aburi Char-su. This dish had an interesting taste, the char-su was super soft, and the dish was presented well. I wish this was the char-su that was in my ramen!   Service: 3/5 On grand opening day, Kenzo Oakville experienced a steady stream of ramen lovers which may have contributed to the slower than normal service. A few blunders: our side dish (appetizer) order was accidentally delivered to another table (and it eventually came after we finished our main dishes), ramen was served without the extra noodles we ordered and only came after we inquired, utensils were missing when dishes were served, and no refill of our waters. Since the onigiri at Kenzo Mississauga was made differently (it's usually torched or pan-fried), we asked the server if they made it differently at every location. She actually mentioned that they should have torched it for us and seemed surprised that it wasn't done (oops!). The saving grace to all of the blunders was that the servers were very polite and pleasant. Definitely lots of room for improvement but I have confidence that things will improve!   Ambience: 3/5  Relatively large space, with ample seating for patrons. There are a total of 13 tables (with a subset of tables on an elevated platform) with more seating at the \"ramen bar\". Set-up of some of the tables not on the platform are oddly placed though - felt like the servers had to zig-zag their way across the floor which seemed a little inconvenient for them. When we first entered, there was an odd smell - reminded me of a wet mop left out too long but the smell quickly went away after 10-15 mins. Would love to walk in to the aroma of ramen next time! :)"}
{"text":"I have tried 3 Ramen places in Toronto: Niwatei, Ajisen, and Kenzo. Kenzo is the winner of these 3 in my opinion. Their atmosphere is better than Ajisen's by miles. They may not have the authentic Japanese feel of Niwatei, but the place looks modern and inviting.   The fact that complementary tea is not served is something I'd generally frown on. However, Kenzo serves a special green tea. It's a stronger version of what you normally get at other places. This green tea is so good that I had forgiven their lack of free tea. I tried their iced version of the green tea. It's just as awesome and this is the kind of thing I'm willing to pay $$$ for.   Taste wise, I think Kenzo is surprisingly better than Niwatei. I find Niwatei's to be amazingly overpriced and not as delicious. Kenzo's soup has a stronger flavor that is closer to what I tasted in Japan. Kenzo's portion is also better than Niwatei's. Don't even get me started on Ajisen's food.   The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it's still kind of expensive and the service is not on par with what you get in Japan. If someone opens a ramen shop with really delicious ramen, at reasonable prices, and complemented by cute waitresses like how it is in Japan, then I'd give it a 5 star rating. I'm kind of using restaurants in Japan as a benchmark for ramen shops. Realistically, I think we'll never get that in Canada."}
{"text":"I've been to other locations and quality is closely up to standard.  This location is a much small place, parking available at the back of the business.  This place is convenient as they have few locations and reliable for the quality.   My all time fav is their grilled seafood Ramen (Nagasaki champon)...  Soup base is excellent!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at the Kenzo location in Mississauga so I was excited to eat here but was extremely disappointed with my experience. The menu has a smaller variety of ramen and the store vibe isn't as great. The waitress bothered us multiple times asking if we were ready when we told her we needed a couple minutes to decide.  My brother and I got the Tonkatsu Shouyu and Miso ramens which tasted like the same soup. There was no depth in the flavour, it was just salty. The noodles were not as good as the other location but I can't put my finger on what the difference was.  My boyfriend had the King Ramen. He said it was really bland and was possibly the worst ramen he ever had. He only ate it because he was hungry. The meat was just grilled and had no flavour. The charsu pork slices from the Mississauga location is marinated and cooked way better.  Since our ramen sucked, I was hoping that the Takoyaki could save our meal but it was the most disappointing part. It looked really good but the takoyaki was swimming in sauce to cover up the burnt exterior. On top of that, it was mushy and not good.  I don't recommend this place. If you want to try Kenzo Ramen, go to the Mississauga location."}
{"text":"I agree with others that this place is average or subpar in terms of service and food. It satisfies that craving but there is definitely better ramen out there. I've been here about 5 times. The broth here is rather flavourless generally and the noodles do have that \"soapy\" or strong alkaline flavour I find. But nothing is offensively bad.   I mean, if the service was excellent it would make things better, but it's not!"}
{"text":"If the noodles had more life, if the soup base was stronger and there were better garnishings, I'd be there for many meals during the week! BTW, the shrimps in the Nagasaki was decent last year. The past few times they deem to have bought smaller cheaper shrimps. Thoroughly disappointed.  **** It's been a little over a year since I wrote anything about Kenzo (original post was Oct. 05/15). In fact, if the star rating could go reverse, I would give it 1/2 a star. The soup base is now so salty and full of MSG that I'm fearful to return due to health concerns."}
{"text":"Hmmm. It's difficult to rate this place. Mainly because there are two ratings for ramen in Toronto. One is rating against other ramen places here and the other is rating against ramen places in Japan. Against ramen places in Japan this gets a 1-star rating. Against ramen places here this gets a 5-star rating. Hmmm.  Anyhow, the ramen is pretty good. While not terribly Japanese, it is nonetheless homemade ramen, and so is one of very few places which offers this in Toronto. I've only had the shoyu and tonkotsu though would like to try the king of kings, miso and shio.  Shoyu: waaay too salty when my friend got this. Could have been an off day as this was near the beginning of their opening of their downtown location. I would definitely prefer the frozen noodles by Maruchan or Nissin which can be found at most any T&T.  Tonkotsu: pretty good. A diluted true tonkotsu broth. If I only imagine a more rich broth my mouth starts to water. Definitely worse than the tonkotsu frozen noodles.  Noodles: OK. nothing special yet better than other ramen noodles found in Toronto. They get the job done but they don't compliment the broth when the broth is good.  Chashu: Could be much better. Again, just gets the job done but still better than other \"chashu\" found in Toronto.  My main complaint is that the price is not worth the quantity of food you get as if you come in here hungry you will not leave full and especially for noodle soup, this is not a good thing! So when there is good udon and pho nearby, why should you settle for overpriced, underfilling, simply OK ramen?"}
{"text":"Can't decide between 2.5 star or 3, because 3 means OK, and service really wasn't OK. Really want to dock another 0.5 star for value.  Splurging a bit today for a solo work lunch. Ordered the Tonkatsu Miso Ramen for about $15 including tax and tips (tipped hesitantly, considering the service).  Quality of the Ramen was excellent. Noodle was cooked to the right chewiness, soup was savory without being too salty like some places, and the 3 pieces of pork/cha siu was tender, juicy with a good distribution of delicious fatness :) The only complain I have regarding this bowl of ramen was I wish they had given a bit more toppings than 3 slices of pork. At $13, I thought the portion could be bigger. Maybe throw in a soft boiled egg, fish cake pieces wouldn't hurt too much right? hehe. I look for quality, but I'm also a value seeker. Can't help it :)  So if this review was based only on the ramen, I wouldn't mind giving it a 4 star. However, the service of my server really ticked me off.   After sitting down, I was given a few sets of menus to look through. I just picked up the set for cold drinks and starting curious figuring out what I'm looking at when the server appeared suddenly over me and said: \"Don't do that, don't do that! It's not supposed to be opened\" The menu consisted of 2 laminated sheets, printed with food and prices on both sides, but it seems they tried to taped them together along the side so that customers only look at the 2 outside faces of the sheets. But when I picked up the menu, it was not completely taped together so it was just hanging together like a book more, waiting to be opened.  She walked away after, leaving me in a state of confusion, trying to figure out what I did wrong. Then confusion quickly turns into annoyance. My thought was: 1) why do you lecture me and assumed I ripped open the menus? 2) if you really don't want people to open the menu, then fully tape it all around the edges maybe?!?!! or how about just print new ones with only the items you want people to look instead of re-using old ones??? jeeeeeeezzzzzzzzz!!!! so annoyed :(  Oh! or maybe it's not that big of a deal ok? Come on! I was a customer. You could have noted that the menus need to be taped back together and do it after I used it or left. It's just not right to lecture me and tell me I did something wrong. That just left me a very bad impression, and a feeling that I'm not appreciated here.   Sorry I came in to \"messed up\" your lousy taped together menu.  Just ridiculous service attitude. I normally don't have high expectation for service at quick service eateries. It's OK if you don't even smile. Just bring me my food well done and prompt is all I want really. But just don't be rude to me.  So ramen was ok, but being spoken to like does not make me want to go back."}
{"text":"A local joint which I visit regularly, Kenzo serves up decent bowls of ramen - perfect for a quick lunch or dinner on a cold winter day.  Portion size is generous, noodles are tender without being mushy and the broth is savoury.   Much like it's other location on Dundas, Kenzo is very busy and so it's best to go at slightly off peak times to avoid the wait for tables.  (oh, there is parking in the back) The menu sticks pretty closely to what it does best and is better for it. You will find a few different kinds of ramen broth along with the requisite gyoza, tacoyaki and tonkatsu.  None of which fail in any particular regard but I must say that the gyoza at the Dundas location is much juicier and tastier than the ones offered here.   The side of spicy pickled daikon is a nice touch to cleanse the palate and cut some of the grease."}
{"text":"Eating here right now the king ramen... that shit is amazing.. crack. Good pricing nice people serving. Really good place to go to."}
{"text":"Kenzo is a part of my regular dine out rotations:  Positive: 1) The service is very quick and friendly 2) This is the most consistent place I have ever been. I have been here well over 15  times. The service and food is very consistent.  3) Very tasty! The broths are quite flavorful.  4) More than one option for vegetarians  Negative: 1) Wish they had a slightly broader menu (more options or perhaps more appetizers for sharing); Coming here frequently, I do get a bit bored after awhile 2) Salty; I feel like I get my sodium intake for three days in one meal, however, this is the case with most ramen!"}
{"text":"First time at Kenzo and second time eating ramen. I got the sho-yu ramen and it was good - nothing to write home about it. I would come here again because of the good price and it's close to my work. The service was really quick and it was a full house - came at noon."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! I got the tonkotsu ramen, which was super tasty. Good amount of noodles and pork. Will be returning! It's new and I think they're still working out some kinks with regards to service but that shouldn't deter you. Everyone was very friendly, and it was quite busy at the time. Overall, really great!"}
{"text":"Went to kenzo this old location on a sunday night. And i have to say i am severely disappointed. They are the epitome of getting things almost correct and then ruining it by adding too much. In this case it is their overuse of pickled vegetables in dishes that have no business having pickled vegetables. I ordered a katsudon and a okonomiyaki. Both dishes were cooked to almost perfect but was noticed quickly infused with a lot of pickled vegetables. That should never be in these dishes. Giving it a sour disgusting taste to two dishes that should be savory and warm. The katsudon the pork was done correct. However the soup used in it was too light in flavour and covered with the pickled vegetable taste. Making it sour. The same can be said about the okonomiyaki. It had great presentatiom value and almodt correct until the flavour was again ruined by pickled vegetable infused inside of it. I have been to tons of places with okonomyaki and they dont make it sour with pickeled stuff cause it ruins the seafood and savory of the dish. The cabbage was also undercooked as it was too raw in some psrts. So i would say this place the service was actually okay. And the presentation is therem but they shoot themselves in the foot. With cooking a dish well and then infusing it with ingredients that should never belong in there. Im disappointed because it could be so good if they just didnt make that mistake."}
{"text":"This is so far the best Raman I've tasted. Until I get to try better one then I'll update."}
{"text":"I have no problem with their food - I usually get the yakisoba or one of the tonkotsu ramen, plus an onigiri - but their customer service is an issue. They're slow to take orders and not good at bringing water, napkins, etc.  Here's an egregious example from my most recent visit. I ordered the yakisoba and an onigiri. They brought out the yakisoba, then a couple minutes later gave the onigiri to the guy beside me. (We were 2 of about 8-10 people in the restaurant and were seated right next to each other). I saw it there and saw him poke it a couple times before they came back to him and asked if he had ordered it. He said no. They asked if they could charge him for it. (!!!!!!!) He said yes. A few minutes later, they brought me an onigiri.  Their reaction during all of this was to tell me nothing. They literally never said anything, just brought me an onigiri that was like 10 minutes delayed because of their mess-up. It was kind of gross. No adjustments to my bill, obviously.  This is just one example. I still remember going here with a family member right as they were getting off of lunch break - which they eat at a table by the cash, without closing the door or putting up a sign or anything - and being told that we MIGHT have to leave or wait until they finished. We didn't, but it was ridiculous."}
{"text":"good amount of parking either at the front or back.  the ramen is really good and flavorful, bowls are really big for the price you pay (you will be full) unlike some places that charge $15 a bowl and you leave hungry. there's lots of choices and i tried a few, can't go wrong here with the ramen.  the takoyaki is way overprice tho."}
{"text":"I ordered the super super large bowl of ramen and devoured it all by myself!!!~ also had to eat takoyaki balls (even after i was too full )   soup base was ok / noodles were good... i dunno... Its not amazingly memorable  I'd still like to hunt around for a good ramen place in toronto (still cannot compare to my L.A experience of a bowl of ramen!)"}
{"text":"While vacationing in Toronto, Canada around the winter time (November time frame to be exact), I wanted some decent ramen and Takoyaki balls. Since I was downtown I decided to use YELP. While looking for a decent place this popped up since I was about 1 min away walking distance. This place is very authentic as in Japanese traditional ramen houses. Very small and the strong smell of broth.. My ramen was decent for not actually being in Japan but the Takoyaki balls were on point. Brought be back to Sasebo, Japan when I use to live there. Great memories and this place was worth it.   Be aware that this place gets PACKED so arrive early or during the week because the weekends are CRAZY!"}
{"text":"An Asian men approaches me so I call out \"King of Kings\".  He ask what I would like to drink and suggests Tea, sure.  As I sit looking at the small but Ramen-esque decor of Ramen Specials on the walls and Introduction of Ramen origins.    I face a cute setting of Table for 2, which I like to say is the Chef's Table.  The person facing the Kitchen will get to see the action and the Noodles coming out, while the person facing the Entrance will see who is going to the Washroom next.  As they head down the stairs which is what the men did after placing my order.  The 2 mid to elder ladies prepped my meal and served it up with a smile.  I oversaw the elder women prepare the side Pickled dish and it looked simply BEAUTIFUL, work of Art like she made it just for me piece-by-piece.  King of Kings($9.95) had a Spice Broth with 4 Yummy Chasu, some Dried Seaweed, Tasty Marinaded Egg, Marinaded Bamboo Shoots, Fish Cake Slice and what I would like to call Manchu Wok style Chop Suey underneath intertwined with the Ramen Noodles.  Ramen Noodles are the straight version and was cooked nicely with just a slight bit of chewiness.  It's a bit smaller in diameter than Ajisen or Instant Noodles so I would say it's inbetween those and Wonton Noodles.  It was good but I like curly Konnichiwa version Noodle better.  In terms of the Toppings, I was impressed with the Chasu with nice fat-to-lean ratio and wasn't dry like some other places.  It even looked visually appealing.  The Chop Suey even had some Ground Meat bits inside that was seasoned well and delicious.  At 4:30 pm, the 2 women and 1 men sat down at the kitchen counter and was having their meal.  The women came over and asked me how the meal was and I said it was \"Delicious\".  A perfect pre-dinner snack.  I will be back for Tonkotsu, my standard Ramen flavour..."}
{"text":"Our go to ramen place. I think it's a family owned business. Our waiter had to take orders, bring the food to our table, do the cashier work and help with the cooking as well. Props to her. Her mom and dad? stayed inside the cooking area when she handled everything on the floor. I'm not exactly a fan of ramen but I'm quite satisfied with theirs."}
{"text":"Meh, i've experienced better. By far one of the worst ramen joints i've tried. The soup lacks flavour and the pork belly was over cooked. Would not come here again especially for the same price as other ramen joints."}
{"text":"Nice place, good ramen. Gyoza was a little burned but pretty juicy inside. Over all - worth its price, wouldnt drive here from far, but if im in the area and looking for quick foodbreak, would definetly drop by."}
{"text":"I had eaten ramen before but wasn't a fan until I tried this place.  Other aficionados might be able to guide you better if you are on a quest but as a white guy with little previous exposure to proper ramen, I think this place is amazing.  It is near work and we go about every other week.  My coworkers love the TanTanMen (the one with ground pork) so much it is the only thing they have ever ordered there.  In fact, this is the only place we go together for lunch as a group.  I've tried about six of the soups and each has been delicious.  The smaller bowls leave me stuffed.    Service is usually very quick and efficient.  They don't seem to mind giving us separate bills.  Recommendation: if you are going for lunch on a weekday, you may not get a table if you don't show up before 12, especially in the winter."}
{"text":"At first I was a little skeptical as I had been to the downtown location.  I decided to get the King Ramen because I was looking for something with spice and it did not disappoint.  The ramen came out really quick and the presentation was wonderful.  They had it ready on a tray along with spoons and a side dish of radishes.  I had also ordered the gyoza and tonkatsu.  The ramen was spicy and the pork pieces were melt in your mouth delicious.  There was a good variety of vegetables inside the soup broth and it's a great step up from the Netsu.  The boiled egg was good and soft as it should be.  The gyoza was good, but you can't really go wrong with that.  The tonkatsu was fried just right and they served it with the typical sauce with some mustard.  Overall, the presentation and taste are definitely worth coming back for in the future and I have changed my mind about Kenzo!!!"}
{"text":"Average ramen. Not too bad not the best. Spacious, clean and service was good. I liked how this ramen joint gave me the choice of eating the sliced beef rice which is a famous dish in Japan which wasn't bad. The only thing I would comment on the background music selection. Pumping hard electronic music, I feel like I'm in a race eating my food against the pumping beats lol"}
{"text":"I feel as though I've been hearing \"ramen\" everywhere these days and since my experience with it doesn't extend past dry Mr. Noodles with seasoning packages, I decided to try it out this weekend. I yelped what was around me and found Kenzo. The most recent reviews were good so I figured it wouldn't be horrendous.   Kenzo's in a small strip plaza but not too easy to miss. Quaint little spot that maybe seats 20? I went on a Saturday afternoon and it was really quiet, which was nice. Waitress was prompt and that will always make me warm up to a restaurant quickly.   The menu isn't overwhelming (another feature I appreciate) and there are pictures which helped with my rookie order. I went with the Sapporo something. I believe it was a miso base with pork and vegetables. I asked for 0.5 spicy on a range from 0-5.   Guys, let me tell you, this was SOLID. I'm really sensitive to spice so I couldn't breathe after five minutes, but it tasted awesome. Wtf was I doing with Mr. Noodles? I'd feel so disrespected if I'd created ramen and the alternative was a 99 cent package of MSG.  Anyway the serving was massive. I was brokenhearted to have not been able to finish it. It was seriously so good. Any order comes with a side of slivered radish which clears your buds so basically every slurp is like trying the ramen again for the first time.   The price was decent: 10 bucks for a bowl I couldn't finish so I felt good about it. So good that I went back again today. I had the gyoza ramen this time which I didn't like quite as much, but liked it enough to finish it.   So I've made it my goal to try everything on this menu and to use Kenzo as a starting point to become a ramen connoisseur. I loved it so damn much."}
{"text":"I like the food a lot. I prefer their ramen than other japanese ramen places. The only thing about it is their service is not the best. Lots of times the staff were just sitting there and chatting and looking at customers."}
{"text":"Really a 3.5 but it's not a rating option.  Portion is pretty good.  Broth tasty but a bit on the salty side.  Noodles are fresh and have a nice texture.  Also enjoy the salmon onigiri as a side dish.  Service is always decent and the food is delivered to your table fast.  Probably on the pricey side but I think it's to be expected with the ramen craze that is going on.  I still need to try a few more ramen places to really know where this ranks in the ramen crowd."}
{"text":"I read other reviews about this place before trying their ramen and decided to ignore the poor reviews and go anyway. Big mistake. Just don't go here. Seriously, do not. If you want poor service, overly salty/spicy ramen and ridiculously long wait times for appetizers, this is the place for you.  There were several empty tables but because there was only one wait staff, they weren't cleaned and ready. So there were long wait times. The takoyaki took half an hour to come out, far longer than it took to make the ramen and it was an app! The reason: because another table ordered it before me and so they had to fish another octopus out of the sea, kill it, dice it up, and grow wheat to make flour to make 6 more octopus balls.  The ramen was boring, nothing special but the server forgot my side dish because she was noticeably underpaid and overworked.  Also, if you plan on splitting the bill, you have to have cash ready because they don't accept credit/debit for separate bills.  I don't normally write reviews but for this restaurant, I felt the need to do so. It's my civic duty to enlighten other yelpers about kenzo.  But other than that, it's a great place to go eat on a sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"This is our go-to ramen spot. Close to home, small family restaurant, and obviously...great ramen (and that's all). What do I mean? Only order the ramen, everything else is just 'okay'. I've ordered takoyaki and gyoza and was not blown away. It passes if you are craving it but you will be fully satisfied with your bowl of ramen. Other yelper pics are accurate pictures of what the place and food looks like:) My favourite ramen is the Tonkatsu and Netsu. Piping hot and chewy noodles swimming in piping hot soup. Service can be a bit slow (it is a family business) but we love it here, it's been consistent so far and we go here at least a few times each month. Definitely check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We had the Netsu and King ramen. Here is how i would rate this place:  Food: 3.75 the flavors were good it just didn't quite feel like we were having ramen compared to my other ramen experiences. Price: 4.5 Service: 4 Overall: 3.5 but there are no halves in yelp so i put three"}
{"text":"Slow service. Ordered shio ramen and miso ramen. Tasted so so. Nothing spectacular. Ordered extra veggie and corn with the shio ramen but I did not think there was any extra veggie added but the corn was added though. The corn was tasteless - not surprising.    Not impressive - not disappointed - as expected - don't need to go visit unless nothing else is open but it closes at 9pm."}
{"text":"Kenzo has pretty good Ramen. It`s no Momofuku so if you hate that place, maybe you`ll love it here and vice versa. However, the service is pretty terrible. The place is usually way too busy for one waitress (even though it is quite small) and she (usually a she) is always super stressed. Super stressed = rude.   I usually order the King of Kings and it's generally pretty good. Since the King of Kings is in the menu, I never have a problem getting it. But if you try to order a small dish or appetizer, the waitress usually gives some convoluted story about how magnetic forces aren't aligned and how it isn't available. There aren't too many Ramen places in Toronto so when I need a fix, I go here.  In the restaurant, Kenzo has a review from The Toronto Star posted on the wall. What is quite funny is that the review isn't very flattering. It says that the wait is long and broth is bland. I guess the owner of Kenzo takes the approach of \"bad news is better than no news\".  http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/DiningOut/article/265040"}
{"text":"Not bad. I had to Chursew Ramen (bbq pork) with a spicy level of 1. This spicy level 1 is actually a spicy level 3 on their normal menu dishes but because it was a special, they added extra spice to it. The spice level was good for me and I like spicy food. If it was any hotter, it would have been painful. The noodles were cooked well and the pork was also good. I would have liked more of the bbq pork in the dish because it was lacking in that area. Also, the dish was mostly the hot broth, ramen, a couple pieces of the pork and a couple vegetables. A little more vegetables would have been nice as well. Service was fast which was good because I was hungry."}
{"text":"It's a decent ramen place, but don't go out of your way for it.  We usually order the spicy king ramen, but I tried the miso ramen recently and it was also delicious. I would recommend ordering spicy level no greater than 1 because it can get overpoweringly spicy. I can handle it, but I find it to ruin the flavour.  The char siu (pork) meat that they use is of good quality in that it's lightly fat and cut into sufficiently large slices. The half-egg is always cooked perfectly with a gooey yolk.  There is free parking at the front of the resto, and there's more parking behind it.  The cons: The service is a bit slow, but not unreasonably slow. There is a slight odour in the restaurant which resembles a humid basement of a house."}
{"text":"Poor service, small portion and expensive. Not as good as other locations. Will not go back again."}
{"text":"Best for lunch or a quick bite. The service was great and attentive. The ramen here is Korean influenced Japanese ramen - and I like it. I tried the Jisu ramen and my mom had the Netsu ramen. The Jisu ramen broth was nice and sticky and had a soy-sauce based broth. It was loaded with lots of fresh veggies (bean sprouts, red pepper, mushrooms, green onion, bok choy). For a carb conscious girl like me I loved how I felt full without eating much noodle.   My moms Netsu ramen was spicy and had a lot of yummy veggies as well.   I think for people that like a fresh, healthier take on their \"traditional\" ramen with more options would definitely enjoy Kenzo's ramen."}
{"text":"Delicious Ramen and gyoza is the best I have tasted in the city.  Really enjoy the dive-iness of this place."}
{"text":"The pork portion is quite big and the taste is good. The chashu adds point for this restaurant.  However, I don't like the broth. It's too salty...It's not rich in flavor. It's just too salty. The waitress didn't ask us whether we were good with the food. So I didn't get the chance to give the advice on broth."}
{"text":"Third and last time I'm coming here.   The tokotsu ramen was very cheap regarding the garnishes. The egg was overcooked and still cold in the middle. Three carpaccio thin pieces of beef and a large handful of sliced scallion and another cheap vegetable to make the bowl seem plentiful; bokchoi. The broth was good, despite the strong onion flavour in my mouth because of the scallion.   Gyoza took forever, and yes they were really big but sweet tasting in an odd way. Did not enjoy it.   Much better Kenzos and other ramen places out there."}
{"text":"Slow, inattentive service. How long does it take to bring out a single rice ball? My companions were 3/4 done their meals before they managed to get a single rice ball in front of me. No one bothered to check up on us through the meal. You'd think they'd have the decency to comp an item that was obviously and woefully late. Nope. Anyway, made my own comp by leaving a 0% tip on a $50+ bill.   These people need to get their act together, both front of the house and back of the house. Forwarded my complaint to head office."}
{"text":"After coming from New York and being dissapointed by ramen there, I was hankering for some good old fasioned Toronto ramen. I followed Jennifer.K's ramen list was was pretty much set to go.  Upon seeing the restaurant, you'll notice really bad parking out front, well it's not exactly easy to park there.  Park in the back, there's ample parking there.  The menu isn't really that big, I mean there's basic ramen, hot ramen, \"ramen delicacies\" and some appetizers.  If you're having trouble finding out what things are, it's kinda neat that they have banners on the wall that tell you about the history of ramen as well as what's in it and what it is.  I ordered the King of Kings ramen.  I mean, how could I not have?  The name says it all!  We also ordered the miso ramen as well as the gyoza.  They also asked me how spicy I wanted the ramen.  Honestly, I didn't even really understand her, so I just said \"Yes\".  I later found out that she just made it \"regular spicy\".  One tip... look at the specials before you order on the wall, you may end up saving some money.    The ramen here is awesome!  A cool thing about the bowl was that it was packed with stuff.  However, the miso ramen didn't exactly have as much toppings ontop of it.  The broth was excellent.  The king of kings one was a spicy \"salt broth\" and was pretty spicy, perfect in my opinion and was nice and well rounded.  The miso broth (which I sampled) was really good as well.  I would could have gone with either one and been happy.  The noodles (which is the most important part) were done very well.  I think the worst thing you could do is undercook or overcook the noodles, but these came out great, nice and chewy and soft. One thing that I wasn't really a big fan of is the chashu on the king of kings ramen.  It was kinda cool that they had char marks on them, but I actually found them kinda tough.  It may have been because it was really lean, or grilled before-hand but it definately could have been more tender.  The gyoza was... alright.  I mean, I've had better.  They're man fried kinda like \"wo teep\" chinese dumplings but are kinda neat because they're nice and tinyfor a perfect two bites. They don't take reservations so defeinatly come early if you have a big party.  We came here on sunday afternoon and waited for about 10 minutes.    I would definately put this place on the top 5 ramen places I've been to.  If you ever have a urge for ramen, go here and give it a shot."}
{"text":"Decent ramen but afterwards, our group of 4 were wickedly tired and thirsty.  As well, I had a headache the rest of the day.  This can only mean one thing - excessive amounts of MSG!"}
{"text":"My favorite, authentic Japanese ramen spot. Great dumplings and takoyaki! Try the tonkotsu ramen it's so good on a cold day. The service is pretty good the food comes nice and fast usually. You might want to ask for wooden chopsticks cause their metal ones they give you get so hot they can burn ya lips"}
{"text":"I have been to Kenzo's sister restaurant Sonoya multiple times. Those who are familiar with Sonoya should expect the menu to be the exact same. However the quality of food is very different   The seafood ramen. Has a much richer flavour. The spice is not painful but enough to make u cough like a smoker if it goes down the wrong way. It's a complex broth that has hints of seafood, pork, and msg. Make sure to order water or tea unless u want ur tounge to fall out   The king ramen was spicy, salty and packed with toppings. However the flavour became very bland after a while. It's a straight up salt and spice bath. Adding more spice powder ruins the flavour. Just have them do it for u. Otherwise it was quite good. Although the chashu was dry...  Noodles were a bit too soggy for both our Portions. But not displeasing.  Solid ramen place. Seafood ramen is the best choice for me."}
{"text":"I found this place using Urbanspoon on my BlackBerry.  My friend and I decided to try it out.  The place was slightly tiny, so it was hard to get a nice seat away from the other people in the place.  My friend and I ordered the Miso Ramen.  It was actually much bigger than expected!  It wasn't bad, but I think I've been too use to Ajisen Ramen.  We ordered a side of Takoyaki (with squid) as well - that was quite delicious.  Side dishes included kimchi and some daikon.    Service was good, but not very quick.  If you plan to park, park in the back!"}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant and it is very consistant. Probably the best place for Ramen in T.O. Turnover at the restaurant is slow, so be prepared to wait during peak dinner hours.  Tokaiyoki is on par with what I had off the streets of Tokyo, but they don't have it available everyday."}
{"text":"Good enough. It's not the best in town, but hardly the worst. I'd only avoid the gyoza as it basically tasted like frying oil. I'd go again if I needed a ramen fix in the area."}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided we want a quick bite of ramen and came across this place.  This place is owned by Koreans and actually makes a pretty decent bowl of ramen. They have the usual fare of ramen with nothing particularly bad but nothing outstanding either. It's honestly a pretty solid 3.5 out of 5.  Their chicken karaage though is quite decent. It's comes fried to a golden brown and served with a side of citrus sauce. It's a bit different from the usual karaage fair.   Worth a try if your looking for ramen and your in the area."}
{"text":"I'd say this is the place to go for Ramen time.  Extremely hard to find parking in the front, but if you go to the back of the plaza there normally is enough parking and it's easier to exit once you finish eating.  This place specializes in Ramen, I usually prefer their Sho-yu and Miso ramen combo with their gyoza.  Along with their Osaka Takoyaki, yummm, better than the takoyaki stand @ T & T middlefield.   This location is closed on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that I am not picky about my food, I am very much like a compost bin for my family ...with the ability to eat any crap.  I went to this joint with my girlfriend and she ordered this spicy ramen, level 2/3. While I ordered the donburi except the waiter told me they no longer serve anything on that menu page (I wonder why they even gave that to me). So I had to choose a ramen. I picked a shoyu one instead.  When the ramen came, my dish was edible. Alright, salty and a little spicy (I asked for a tiny bit). Nothing really that special. But my girlfriend was having trouble eating her dish. Apparently it was too spicy, thou she was korean and she was accustomed to the nature of spicy foods. I decided to try one beansprout from her dish and I began to die. It felt like my entire mouth went on a trip to the boiling volcanos. I have high tolerances for spicy foods too (and I really enjoy it) except what was infront of us was not something that is edible for human beings.   We asked the waiter what he could do since there is no way we could finish that bowl without causing damage to ourselves. He gave us another small bowl of soup but that didnt really help much. My girlfriend began to collect the dark red oils and place it all into one bowl until it was about a cup's worth of \"hot sauce\" collected in a separate bowl. Needless to say, this was a challenge for the both of us.   I quickly finished my bowl and told her to take her noodles out and put it in my soup. That became a little better but after our meals, her mouth was swollen from the pain of the soup. I never had a meal in my life where I had to struggle so much. If african children were to eat this, they'd rather wait for their next meal.     We ran over to mcD next door afterwards to recover by munching down on some ice cream. Thank god we survived.   NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"I've since been back a few more times at this location and each time  I had the Sapporo Miso ramen with ground pork. It's tasty but not oily, flavourful but not too salty, and the ground pork with vegetables go together so well. It's now my go to dish when I'm here."}
{"text":"Ramen is my winter comfort food of choice.  I've been on somewhat of a tear lately and the bowl here has been by far the best.    The broth was perfectly balanced and didn't feel too rich or over-salted.  I ordered the Tonkotsu Sho-yu but now looking at the pictures on the menu I think I got just the regular Tonkotsu.    Just goes to Sho-yu that I don't know what Sho-yu means.  Yup, I took it there.  What now?  Anyway, from the broth to the meat, and the plethora of sprouts, this was an extremely satisfying bowl.  I'd say the ramen here beats Ajisen further down on Yonge, but Ajisen has much more variety.  If you're craving the staples done well, come here.    I also had an order of Gyoza, which made it way too much food for one person.  The Gyoza was also well executed and had a surprisingly nice flavor.  I find a lot of places with gyoza, you pretty much only taste pork.  This had a nice blend of pork and other veggies.  The dipping sauce enhanced it well, though it was plenty juicy on its own.  Survey says?  Great Success!"}
{"text":"tonkotsu shoyo ramen soo yummy and I love it visit first time visit this location. I usually went to other one@4860 Yonge St I always ordered fired noodle also so great"}
{"text":"Very rich broth, not too salty. I like the texture of the noodle.  Restaurant is very small, stroller is definitely a no no."}
{"text":"Yum!! Stumbled across this gem while I was hangry, and I sure am glad I found it!  The food was great. We tried the king's ramen, shio ramen, and gyoza - pleased with every aspect of our meals. Yummy broth, great noodles, and aweeeesome pork. Also, the egg was cooked perfectly.  Great, friendly, and attentive service.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a nice neighbourhood noodle house, cheap eats, small menu. No high end ingredients but good size portions.   It's pretty good given the price. And the decor...   One thing though, their dumplings are plump and very good"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Japanese ramen (or at least know what it's supposed to taste like), Kenzo is probably your best bet in Toronto.  This review focuses only on the North York location.  I've been to the other Kenzos and have been disappointed with what I had there.  I always cringe when I hear people touting Ajisan as \"good ramen\"..  Couldn't be farther from the truth.  The noodles there are closer to spaghetti if you ask me.  I was introduced to Kenzo 2/3 years ago and have been converting fellow ramen lovers from Ajisan since.  Pros:  As authentic as you can get for Japanese ramen Miles ahead of other ramen places Portions are very good TAKOYAKI  Cons: Wait times for food can be long Parking is not so friendly out front, use the back when u can  Like I said, Kenzo is pretty much as close as it gets to authentic ramen in Toronto.  The noodles are made by the owners themselves.  Yes, they are Korean but they know what they're doing.  The noodles always come out at the right consistency and the broth, though not as excellent as when Kenzo first started out, is still very good.  King of Kings is where it's at.  You can't go wrong there.  You can get it regular (which is akready a little spicy to start) or spicy.  They really kick it up a notch when you order it spicy.  I'm from Taiwan and I found their spicy to be pretty spicy.  I also recommend the Tonkotsu and the Ji Su Men.  There are many other types of ramen I've yet to try, but I'm sure others can attest to those for me.  The ladies in the back really pay good attention to detail.  Your ramen looks very close to the pictures in the menu you ordered from.  Lastly, everyone must have the Takoyaki.  I always judge a Japanese place by how they make their Takoyaki.  If a place is willing to put the time and effort into Takoyaki then it's a safe bet they're putting in the same for everything else.  The Takoyaki is some of best in town as well.  I always get an order or two when coming here.  It does take some time, but well worth it.  So all in all, a very good place that all fans of ramen should try.  It isn't Japan, but as good as it gets for now.  I can't say the same for the other locations, but the North York location is a sure bet if you ask me."}
{"text":"I have not had taken in so long, when I discovered that their vegetarian ramen is also vegan, I immediately rushed over to try some. I don't remember what ramen is supposed to taste like anymore, but I really enjoyed their vegetarian creamy ramen."}
{"text":"First time coming to Kenzo Oakville location. I will always do my best to support local businesses! My feedbacks...the restaurant is clean and the decor is simple as expected for a small restaurant. The service is slow (I guess they did not expect the consistent turn out of people will be dinning). As I was there I notice the confusion with a couple of orders being sent back because orders were wrong. The portion is smaller then other kenzo's I've been too. (The one at Yonge & Mississauga location).  However, I did go back a second time hoping the experience will be different but nope! Let's just say that I would be willing to go back in a couple of months and hopeful they will get there barrings on food quality and service and only when I have extreme craving for authentic Ramen and not wanting to travel."}
{"text":"Been here several times for lunch and order to go for dinnner. I love the fresh Raman complimented by the perfect flavouring of the soup/broth. My favourite is the Netsu-raman (spicy pork and vegetables) I always ask for level 3 which means the level of heat. The ratios between Ramen and vegetables works well together. No matter what the time of day or season this soup is always satisfying and filling. Portion is huge which is great for the people with bottomless stomach :) I myself can never finish it. The price is reasonably decent for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"What a happy find in my own neighborhood! I didn't know that ramen comes in so many different broths, and the toppings here are creative! Will have to try them all, and there's other items on the menu also (like ramen pizza!, vegan options too).  The atmosphere is cozy/neighbourly, just begs for regular visits. The service was exceptional, fast, relaxed, friendly. And it's quiet! Quiet! The place is full and everyone's just quietly chilling."}
{"text":"To be honest, this place was a little underwhelming.   I was a little surprised by the fact that hot tea had an extra charge of $1.00 per cup. But that isn't a big deal I suppose.  I personally have a huge love for Japanese ramen, so I may have expected too much from this restaurant. I ordered the King of Kings Ramen, and was slightly disappointed by how my bowl of noodles were drowned in beansprouts. It was to the point where there were more beansprouts than noodles.   The soup base was decent, but was lukewarm. The pork were well made, and tasted as I expected. I would come back one more time, but doubt I would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"A prime example of what ramen is supposed to taste like. Service was incredibly fast for a Friday evening."}
{"text":"I had a great time here.  I visited with a good friend of mine with my wife and daughter as well. The staff did a great job of accommodating us. They have a lot of great options for food (They have Vegetarian ramen options too).  I had their Ramen Pizza, it was OK. I was curious, I had it. I probably wouldn't order it again but I'm glad that I had it."}
{"text":"Kenzo is ramen restaurant in an old building. The decor is pretty plain. There is plenty of tables.   The service was pretty bad. The waitress was grumpy and never refilled our glasses.  I ordered the king of king ramen dish with pork. It was pretty good.  I been here three times because it is affordable and the food is pretty good especially the king of king dish."}
{"text":"I really like this place! The service is quick and ramen is amazing as well!  Been here at least three times now and they've never disappointed. The king of king ramen is likely my favourite here. It's a little spicy but so so good! The size is HUGE though... you may have to pack some and take it home! I order this everytime.   The Miso veggie ramen was a little bland so I will suggest picking something else.  Free parking is rare, but try parking around the residential streets and walking over."}
{"text":"Haven't been so upset by the service and food from a restaurant for so long. The food has only gotten worse in here. The ramen we ordered has 80% bean sprout over a 20% content of noodle. The pork was no where near what it is supposed to look and taste. The egg looks extremely small. Out of all, only the soup base is barely acceptable. Perhaps it should be renamed as Kenzo bean sprout soup instead. We also ordered takoyaki (octopus ball) which arrived late, tasted like banana split and the ball is empty with a small octopus meat in it. Fast food style takoyaki would have made it much better.  The waitress demonstrated little service manner by throwing down the menus on the table. She also failed to perform her job professionally by delivering the wrong food to the wrong table twice in a roll.  Overall, the experience was terrible. With the price being no less than any downtown Japanese operated ramen restaurant, there is no point to visit this location of Kenzo if you want to eat good ramen. If you want fast food to fill up the stomach on the neighborhood, try another restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen places I've been to. No nonsense atmosphere with a focus on quality, fresh and hearty ramen. Not the type of place that formalizes ramen into a trendy, hipster douchebag experience, but rather a traditional and satisfying bowl of soup. I highly reccomend the king ramen, as it has a little bit of everything. The pork is tender, well-cooked and plentiful while the broth is rich, complex and well-balanced. I'd also encourage you to explore the menu a little bit. Both the meat and vegetarian gyozas are quite delicious, as are the takoyaki."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the only places in town that makes ramen the real way. They make their own noodles and their Shoyu ramen is fantastic."}
{"text":"I've tried the kenzo ramen in Mississauga but it was my first time trying it in Toronto. My friend and I came by to this location and it wasn't busy at all when we went. The place was empty and when we walked in, no one was there to greet us until we walked further in to see if there was even any workers. They do however have a selection of ramen styles, I got the shoyu ramen with mild spice and the broth was really good! The noodles were soft and perfectly cooked and it also came with a side of radish.  Overall, it was a decent place for a hot bowl of noodles but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Pretty decent for Toronto. The menu online threw me off as there are alot more choice on the menu. Overall pretty good but short wait time. There is parking as well. I had the shio which wasnt too salty just right.   The miso is a little too salty though."}
{"text":"As a ramen fanatic, I've tried most of the ramen shops in the city. Kenzo is a chain that started with the yonge and steeles location and expanded its way down.  To be fair, Kenzo is not the most authentic ramen with its Korean influenced flavours. As such, I am basing this review purely against its other chain locations. Kenzo versus Kenzo.  First, let's start with the service. Service is non existant here like most other asian restaurants. This is to be expected, but I've had much better service at their other locations. The waitresses here looked like they hated their jobs and wanted to be elsewhere. No communication whatsoever. Simply hands me the menu, walks away and starts talking with their co workers behind the counter. No \"hello, how are you?\" Or \"here's the menu, would you like some water or tea to start?\"  Onto the food. I ordered the netsu ramen which is a spicy ramen. This is my standard go-to menu choice when i visit kenzo. The waitress comes over, places the tray on my table without a word, and walks away to chat with her coworker once more.  The netsu ramen comes in this big bowl filled with noodles, ground pork, and veggies. I'm used to walking out feeling quite satisfied after having one of these bad boys, and for 10 dollars, it's not a bad deal. At this location however, the netsu ramen, or shall i say beansprout ramen, was very disappointing. The amount of noodles in the bowl was shockingly little with the beansprout to noodle ratio being 2:1. No joke! Furthermore, the owner lady (it was obvious that she was the owner because she was berating and yelling at her employees) looked as if she had dung under her nose. Seriously! I swear i've never seen such a miserable person.   All in all, this specific kenzo location left me with a bad taste in my mouth and i left feeling hungry. Very disappointing in every single way.  On a positive note, the food came out in 3-4 minutes as usual. Excellent if you want a disappointing meal in a rush!"}
{"text":"Good uptown ramen, my friends and I go here occasionally and it's always been consistent. Staff are very nice and service is quick.  Food-wise if you're not in a ramen mood the katsu here is excellent, and also the takoyaki was very good.  Most of their ramen here is tasty and i doubt you'll be disappointed. The parking lot at the back can be a bit of a hassle but it's usually not full. It's a really small place, so big groups might want to call ahead and make sure it's not too busy.  There's a couple 'private' booths but most of the tables aren't setup like that."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of ramen places in the city and Kenzo Ramen is in my top 3. My favourite is Tonkatsu Ramen with creamy broth. They always bring you your order pretty fast if they're not too busy. Service is always superb and the broth...mmm delicious. On a bitter cold winter day, a nice bowl of hot ramen is all you need to feel nice and warm in your tummy. If you're in the area, you owe it to yourself to stop by and sample one of their ramens."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty decent, similar to the north location at Yonge and steeles buy some bowls have smaller portions. The menu is a little smaller and drinks menu limited. The only reason I would not return is because there's a funky smell in the furniture that will never raise it's calibre past 3 stars. Service pretty good."}
{"text":"Really good ramen! King of kings highly recommended. Gyoza is really good as well. Staff are very friendly and service was excellent. Prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Have yet to review this place, despite being here several times over the years. While Kenzo was once considered a go-to place for Ramen (before the huge boom of recently opened Ramen places), it's become fairly mediocre in comparison.  I typically go for the \"King Ramen\" due to the additional pork, and spicy base. Have also recently tried the \"Miso Ramen.\" Neither are anything to get too excited about when comparing to the soup base and noodle quality offered by a few other notable places in Toronto - this place is still fairly generous with its portions though.     The service here can be inconsistent, with certain servers going absentee at times (e.g. not refilling water or bringing cutlery), though it's likely due to their being understaffed. I will always remember the time I brought out-of-town friends here last summer, and was embarrassed by all the flies that were allowed to fly around the restaurant...this hasn't been a problem during recent visits, but I will see how it is this summer.  Overall, nothing amazing here anymore, but I will likely be back due to the convenient location and availability."}
{"text":"I always get my hair done at the Salon next door and once in a while, when I'm starving, I'd end up eating here after with a friend or get takeout from here. I've never loved anything here prior so I eventually just stopped coming here. One time I got the chicken Katsu takeout and it was so bland that I never came back again.  Recently I've discovered Kenzo Ramen downtown and when the next time I had my hair done I noticed the place next door is also Kenzo, I thought it must be the same North York location everyone is talking about, so I gave this place another try yesterday.  Now, according to the Kenzo Ramen website, this North York location does not exist. I'm quite confused because the menu I saw yesterday was quite similar to the locations downtown (slightly less items). I ordered the King of Kings (Netsu ramen with 5 extra toppings) and it was just as good as the ones I have had in the downtown locations. So is it, or is it not the same chain/franchise? I have no idea. The food is just as great though. The best part is probably their chasu, which seems to be freshly grilled to perfection. There are grill parks on the round pieces of pork.  My main concern for this place is their lack of employees. There are only two servers, one of whom seems to be the owner and only hangs out by the kitchen to collect and distribute money for delivery, leaving one girl to get order, serve food, and clean up. Needless to say, the wait was long. Even at 2:30pm in the afternoon, we had to sit around for 30 minutes before we got seats. Thankfully the food was worth the wait."}
{"text":"The tonkotsu and Sapporo miso we ordered were both unremarkable, and the gyoza was just not worth the money. There are much better ramen in the neighbourhood. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Slurp Slurp Slurp! I love Kenzo Ramen! Now I know where to get my Ramen fix when I am Uptown!  Small storefront in a strip plaza we almost miss it even when we are walking along Yonge Street.   King of King Ramen oh so tasty! I found the broth here is more spicy and have more kick than the one down at Dundas. Love the grilled marks on the tender chasu. The noodle here is ok, for texture and chewy wise not as good as Konnichiwa.   I love their Gyoza here! If like me have nightmares after eating those frozen, then deep fried packaged like Gyoza that served in a lot of places.. what they made here are so good!! The skin is light and thin, closed to transparent! Size wise they are a little smaller than the ones downtown though.  Service here is nice and friendly. I doubt this place will get too busy compare to the downtown locations.  Free parking at the back... try not to park in the front, because you will have a hard time trying to back out to Yonge Street during rush hour!  BTW, this Kenzo gives customers free tea.  They accepts VISA and Mastercard."}
{"text":"I just could not resist a bowl of Ramen.  Location is great as it is close to Yonge and Sheppard so great if you takes TTC. If you drive, there are quite a few meter parkings in the area.  Deco is simple and clean. Wait staffs are nice and patient.  An order of  my usual King of Kings Ramen and Gyoza is perfect to share with my friend.  I still think Kenzo Ramen has the one of the best gyoza I have in town. The wrapping always done with a hint of crispness and the fillings always juicy and savoury!  Kenzo Ramen is decent place if you want a Ramen Fix."}
{"text":"Been to the other Kenzo on Bloor and this one didn't disappoint as well, although distinctly more Korean in terms of servers/customers.  Definitely give it a try if you are in North York and love Ramen. If you are extra hungry order the Gyoza which aren't bad as well!"}
{"text":"Been to this location once but I've been to Mississauga location many times and the Toronto location once. So based on my past experiences in the Mississauga and Toronto location, I THOUGHT I was familiar with the service style and the food. I was wrong.  The service was super slow (when we got there the place was half full but enough staff to take care of everyone). We did not get water until after twenty minutes after sitting down and we didn't get service to take our order twenty or half an hour AFTER getting our water (we had to get two of us waving our arms to get their attention).  Meanwhile we see three ladies carrying the food for a table of three of four (like seriously? We have a tray to put two or three bowls at the same time for a reason).   The food came out at an appropriate time. When we got the food, the noodle was not ramen, it was like udon noodle put into a ramen broth. But as the this point because of the slow service, I was too hungry so I didn't bother sending my food back to the kitchen.   I shouldn't be comparing other stores but as a franchise to work, this location needs serious adjustment when it comes to the food and the service.  Don't get me wrong, the ladies were polite...but they seem like they don't want to deal with customers if they choose to ignore us.    Disappointing. Back to Mississauga location I go."}
{"text":"Excellent food and good value for portion size.   Nice place. Sometimes very busy. Limited seating"}
{"text":"The ramen itself was very delicious but if youre going to order the king of kings ramen, be weary that most of it is bean sprouts... and if you are looking for something really spicy, go for the special that they have."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night and enjoyed their ramen.  Price wise is pretty reasonable.  I also enjoyed their matcha iced tea.  It's very refreshing and not sweet which is why i love matcha.  Great place to check out and eat ramen on a cold winter night."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, a recent Naruto fanboy, (hold your eye rolling) has been on the hunt for a local ramen place. After a girlfriend of mine found a place near her office, we set up a meeting for a ramen dinner. We arrived shortly after 7pm after combatting the traffic between Vaughan and Toronto -- but the commute was well worth it. For our appetizer, we ordered the gyoza which were MASSIVE and fresh: you could really taste the pork, ginger, garlic and green onion with every bite. My boyfriend ordered the miso ramen, as did my friend - and I ordered the Orochong Ramen. Wow, talk about flavour that will really packing a punch. I love spicy food, and this ramen was definitely right up my alley. The grilled vegetables were crisp and really absorbed the heat and flavours from the ramen. While I didn't particularly care for the chicken as it tasted reheated, the broth alone completely made up for it. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Solid and Satisfactory.  I have the spicy ramen and I was pleasantly surprised.  I paired it with be matcha slush, wow, my favourite so far of all the matcha drinks I had.  It was worth the try and with time and more business I can see them being successful.  I would return."}
{"text":"if you are uptown and want ramen, Kenzo is your best ramen place to satisfy that noodle craving.  although the establishment is korean run, the chef trained in japan on ramen and you will get an honest japanese style ramen from here.  they dont have a really huge menu, but it is quality over quantity.  They have authentic okonomiyaki that they make fresh and serve on a sizzling platter with all the fixings.  their gyoza is fresh and cooked to perfection.  their takoyaki (round pancake balls with a piece of octopus) is authentic and fresh too.  less soup base options to ajisen, but if you find the equivalent here, you should find that it is less salty, less msg.  being korean run, seeing any kimchi or pickled radish actually makes sense, and i think there is kalbi (korean beef short ribs) on the menu as well.  their service is not fast, and this place can be quite busy at times, but if you want ramen and you are not downtown on dundas or queen street, this is the best ramen you can get.  i can vouch for the quality and consistency of this particular location, dunno about other Kenzo locations.  i miss the tempura they used to have at this location, but it was taken off the menu.  if you want an authentic bowl of ramen or okonomiyaki that is the closest thing to getting to Japan and having one there, this is the place if you are uptown."}
{"text":"Had the angriest server serve us.  Maybe she had a bad day? Nevertheless, made us feel like we were an inconvenience so we wanted to quickly finish our ramen and get out ASAP.  The kenzo closer to Yonge and Sheppard is more preferable.  Friendly staff, ramen just as good."}
{"text":"One word to describe this place: Disappointing  Been told by fellow korean friends that this chain is \"not bad\" as its similar to the ramen shops in korea I been to those shops in korea, i also been to the ones in japan, so this Kenzo shop, at least this one, not sure about the others, is an absolute disgrace to whatever \"japanese\" style its serving  Lets start with what was ordered Karashi ramen $8.95 Tsukemen $10.95  Lets start with the karashi Huge portion, always a plus for any big eaters such as myself First taste is the spicy broth...mmmm...barely any flavour...its like they dumped spicy sauce in hot water and mixed it So now im not looking forward to the rest of the bowl, you know if the broth is bad in a bowl of ramen, saving the rest may be near impossible The roasted pork slices were all right, bean sprouts flooded my bowl, noodles not good, woodear mushrooms okay, bamboo shoots looked and tasted like it came straight out of the bottle from the chinese supermarket and the fish cake...not sure which frozen one they bought but it tasted funny  So okay...pretty bad bowl of ramen...looked at my gf's tsukemen, looked okay, must be better than mine This is how she described her tsukemen Noodles tasted like dish soap The dipping broth had like no flavour, such a lack of salt The roasted pork slices tasted like...dry flavour meat And fish cake had a weird taste like mine did  Overall Disappointing Never again  Only plus was the server, he was really nice and unfortunately we cant blame him for the food :("}
{"text":"Kenzo, closer to home.  enough said.  yelp says it's not enough said...so  The atmosphere & energy the staff brings really makes this joint special for me.  The ramen is classic.    Only gripe is the price, a few dollars cheaper and I'd consider going much more often."}
