{"text":"I've been eating at ASEAN for a while now.  Take out used to be good.  Tonight it just sucked. Disappointing.   I wanted ASEAN food and also sushi.   To start sushi was badly cut the size was all wrong big pieces then small tiny piece and also it wasn't fresh I had sashimi.    I would suggest rolls if you want sushi.   We also ordered salt pepper squid it came soggy and not great also the orange beef was soggy.   When you go In person it's usually better.   I think they are just going downhill.   They just don't put the love they used to.     To bad.  Won't order again.  Will go try it again in person.     All you can eat is hard to resist"}
{"text":"You know a restaurant is awesome when you ask them to skip the shrimp in your Singapore noodles and they compensate for what's missing by giving you a ton of extra chicken.  It was the best."}
{"text":"I come here regularly and I used to like it much more before. I find the service is much slower and delivery or pick up is really slow and often made with mistakes. The decor of this restaurant needs to be cleaned up and redone.  It looks too run down and old. My gf loves it here so we keep coming back, but it's not a top choice of mine when it comes to sushi."}
