{"text":"How does a place like this stay in business? I've been trying to visit this place since it opened, and gave up. I met the owner one morning while I was out doing laundry. They'd been setting up inside for weeks with a huge \"COMING SOON\" banner teasing for weeks, and I asked when they were opening. He replied \"We opened yesterday, come on in sometime!\" It was 8am, and I was soon off to work, so I decided to pop in on my way home.   I passed by on my way home from work at 9:35pm, and the place was CLOSED! (despite the sign on the door saying they closed at 10pm) The following night, the same thing.   Finally, I decided to stop in on a Sunday afternoon. The flyer, which had been distributed in the neighbourhood, stated they were open from 11am until 6pm. Stopped in at 4pm, and guess what?  CLOSED!!!   How in the hell does this guy plan on staying in business, if he's only going to be open when he feels like it, and doesn't stick to an advertised schedule? I've all but given up on this place. I'll take a drive to Memphis BBQ in Vaughan next time I'm in the mood for BBQ."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say. The Mac and cheese is the best I've ever had. The ribs were awesome and the wings were juicy and fall off the bone. The hubby had the Dean sandwich and loved it. We will definitely be back. Maybe tomorrow."}
{"text":"This no frills place has delicious food and friendly service.  The pulled pork sandwich was tasty and generously sized.  The brisket sandwich was juicy.  All items are reasonably priced.  I wish this was closer to my home!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for a while now and to this day I haven't had better tasting bbq in Ontario so far. I have travelled all over Ontario for work and tried every single bbq spot I could find but none of them taste as good. To add to the delicious BBQ food they have creole food too. The Etoufee is absolutely fantastic! The Braised Beef Ribs are to die for! The beef brisket is as tender and as juicy as they come. Every single thing they make there is perfect. My goto place for southern bbq."}
{"text":"The service, the food and the people is why I keep going back and back for more. There is no better BBQ place in Ontario. I have travelled all over Ontario for work and tried to find every BBQ spot and none of them stack up. Best wings, best brisket, best beef ribs(braised beef ribs too)...i can keep going on and on. They are highly rated for a very good reason."}
{"text":"Nice folks there but the food is just not good. The ribs are way over sauced and some of the sides seem refried. A home-kitchen frier is used for some of the apps that leave it apparent that they were cooked in stale oil that wasn't hot enough. Add to that the waiting time despite having called in advance.   I've tried them twice now and have been let down both times."}
{"text":"Found them on Yelp while stranded in town.  Great service, stayed to eat there to continue our visit.  Hubby had the beef brisket, while I normally dont love, but I will break with my traditional pulled pork favourite next time.  It was tender, smokey, and cooked to perfection.  My pulled pork was great as well.  Definately good value fast food.  Jean the owner told us that the beef was Canadian AAA.  Another plus.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken wings for quick take out. Everyone was asking where they came from. Plan on trying more in the future!! Friendly staff. Clean establishment. Good prices for excellent quality."}
{"text":"Always looking for a good BBQ joint. My friend and I stumbled upon RD's Southern BBQ in Brampton. This place is legit. Slow cooked pulled pork with a killer sauce. This place is BBQ done right.   Friendly owner and staff and great lunch specials."}
{"text":"RDs is by far the most authentic BBQ in southern Ontario if not Canada that I have experienced.  The pulled pork is made in the traditional style and the home made BBQ sauce is inspirational.   Ambiance?!!  The decor is understated, but who goes for BBQ for the dining experience?  I go for the food!  If you want a themed experience take yourself off to chuck-e-cheese and leave me alone with my brisket!  The service is perfect...laid back and unhurried...authentic and real. If you have come in a rush...don't because we don't want your pace of life to give us indigestion!   Let's get real, down and dirty...give me ribs, chicken and a coleslaw that should be illegal (it is that good) and I don't care where I eat...and if you are serious about real BBQ then don't miss RDs...it will change your life."}
{"text":"I got Dean's bad habit. It was HUGE! I managed to eat half of it. The meat was tender, juicy and moist. The flavour was just right. My only complaint was the bread. It could've been toasted for a nice crunch/crispness. The coleslaw needed a bite to it. It lacked the crunchy texture I'm used to eating. Other than than these two points, this place was great!"}
{"text":"I'm all about hidden gems and this place is definitely one of them!  The nice man behind the counter was so kind and after I told him it was my first time visiting he threw in a side for me! My husband and I got the po boy sandwich with catfish, beef ribs, beef brisket,  and corn bread.  The catfish was soo good my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Fried crispy with a really unique taste that doesn't scream fish.  It was topped with this really amazing sauce and sandwiched between soft bread that tasted like they made it fresh (not sure if they actually did tho).  The beef rib was unreal.  It was smokey and tender.  The brisket was good too although I'm not a big fan of brisket sandwiches.  The corn bread is a must.  I didn't share that one. Haha Overall definitely a good spot for quality food.  we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"\"Makes ordering take out more difficult than it needs to be\"  Take out process: I've ordered from the Kennedy Road location and despite coming when they told me to come (between 30 mins to 45 mins from ordering) I end up waiting when I get there.   However, that doesn't beat the horrors of ordering from the new location on 25 Aventura. I called on their grand opening day and they declined to accept my order due to a plumbing issue. What's more they had shut down their Kennedy location to help with the opening of the Aventura location. OK, fine, its their opening day, so i suppose they can experience some growing pains.   I called to place an order for take out on May 9, the day after their opening day. The person I spoke to had declined to accept my order for take out on the basis that somehow my take out order would cause delays in serving their instore customers. (I was prepared to wait as long as was required to have my food ready) Further, the person then suggested that if I wanted take out, I would have to go to the restaurant, sit down, order the food and then wait for the food to come and then pack it up. Judging from my previous experience at the Kennedy road location, this would be an immense investment of my time just for a take out. The person's rationale was that he doesn't want this location to be a \"take out\" location like the Kennedy road location.   To make the ordering process even more complex, the menu on the website does not apply to the Aventura location with somethings being more expensive.   Food quality: I was very impressed with the quality of the BBQ at the Kennedy road location. However, with the openning of the Aventura location, it seems that the quality has gone no where but down. My ribs were bland and fries were soggy (eww). Also, the take out seems to be missing items. My colslaw was missing and only realized that when I got home.   Probably won't be going back.   Thank you."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the drive!!! The macaroni is to die for. ...the BBQ mouthwatering....hush puppies FANTASTIC...but the service. ..you can't get better!!! See you soon!!"}
{"text":"We went to the little location only to find it closed due to a family emergency....so we came to the \"other\" location....this was our first time at this location but the food was the same!! Consistency is important and they nailed it!!! The food is flavourful and portions are huge...price is reasonable...we left stuffed and had leftovers!! Worth the drive from Whitby!!!"}
{"text":"Not as good as southern USA BBQ,  but I have to say this is about the best ribs you are going to find in the GTA at a decent price.  The staff are nice and prompt. The ribs are juicy with great sauce. The cornbread and coleslaw were also good.   They have a unisex bathroom and some complimentary parking out front.  Would eat here again to support what appears to be a family run business."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. One of the best restaurants I have eaten in Brampton. Staff are great and Ribs are delicious! Favorite item in the menu to get is Big Daddy."}
{"text":"The pulled pork was delicious (not lean) and tasty. The sauce was tasty (medium). The beans were spectacular, and I wish I would have received more with my sandwich.  At $7.50, a good sized pulled pork sandwich and a small side dish of beans, is a good value. A side of coleslaw was unnecessary because the sandwich has cole slaw on it!  I will be back, very soon, to try to brisket sandwich.  The lady working there was very helpful and very hospitable."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! Best ribs we have had in a long time. Hush puppies come with an odd sauce (possibly British salad cream?) but the beans and coke slaw are excellent!"}
{"text":"I've just gotta say, how did I not find this place sooner?? I learned about this place from my husbands' cousin who highly recommended it. And I've gotta agree! The food, the service and the selection is great!  This place is a hidden gem in a modest little corner plaza.   I had a pleasant experience from the moment I picked up the phone to place an order for pick up for my husband and my parents. The lady who answered was pleasant to talk to and took the time to answer my questions even though it sounded busy there (she had to put me on hold a couple times). When my husband arrived for pickup 20 minutes after the call, our order was almost ready. He had a nice chat with the lady that worked there and even pointed out to me that the staff is so friendly and welcoming.   As for the food, we ordered a full rack of ribs, a brisket sandwich, dirty rice, cornbread and coleslaw. Everything was delicious!! The ribs were tender and the sauce was so good, the brisket sandwich had tender meat in a kaiser bun with the same BBQ sauce and was delicious, the rice was flavourful and a good compliment to the ribs, the cornbread had a nice crumble and an authentic southern taste that went perfect with the ribs and even the brisket sandwich, and the coleslaw was one of the best I've ever had! I'm not a big coleslaw fan, but the creamy coleslaw I'll buy again with more servings!   I'll likely be coming here again this week to try the chicken or other things. Oh and they have some items that are only available on weekends so I'll probably be back at that time to try some stuff."}
{"text":"Best food in brampton, doesn't matter what kind this place beats it. Awesome rib tips and customer service. Hush puppies are a must try!"}
{"text":"I was in the Brampton area on some business and found myself there past dinner time so decided to take a look and see what kind of deliciousness my fellow Yelpers would recommend here.  Lo and behold, one of the top places around me was a BBQ joint!  Since its been a long time since I've had a good pulled pork sandwich (in Syracuse), I decided to go for it.  As I pulled up to the plaza to RD's I have to admit that I was not impressed.  It was located in a dingy strip plaza next to the likes of a Subway and a 2-4-1 pizza.  Don't let appearances fool you. Inside is a basic diner setup, with a small seated dining area at the end.  Pretty basic, but functional.    I ended up ordering the Dean Bad Habit sandwich (pulled pork and beef brisket) and a side of corn bread.  Jean, the chef and presumably the owner, was quick to serve and made small talk with me as he prepared the food.  He even showed me how large the sandwich was and said that I better be hungry; if anything, seeing that monstrosity of a sandwich got me even hungrier.  Overall, the food was fantastic, especially for the price.  The portions were enormous - I finished neither the sandwich or the corn bread and both were saved for a late night snack.  The pulled pork, in particular, was excellent, while the brisket could have used a little more smokiness to it.  I barely even made a dent in the corn bread, but it was definitely top notch stuff, slightly sweet with a light texture.   I don't often get Southern BBQ food when I'm eating out, but I definitely would if there were more places like RD's around.  I've had better, but for the price/value you can't beat this in the GTA.  I'll be back the next time I'm in Brampton."}
{"text":"Authentic BBQ. Brisket, mac&cheese, even the cornbread is awesome! If you like real BBQ, this is the best I've had in Ontario. Beats any downtown Toronto place hands down."}
{"text":"Servers where really nice and friendly. THE food on the other hand was over priced mediocre food. Sauce was over powering my both the pulled pork and my date's beef brisket. Finally I'm almost sure the meat wasn't cooked for the 12 hours they had claimed, it was unbelievably chewy."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Really good. Everything on the menu is perfect if you are into BBQ's. However I'm taking off 1 star as they are very slow. I've been here 4x and there always a very long wait for the food."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Friendly staff. First time here and I will definitely be back for more. Shared the po'boy catfish sandwich and a small pulled pork poutine. Catfish was light tasting, fresh and tasty. The fries were yummy, thick cut, fresh and the pulled pork and sauce were the best I  have had (been to Memphis bbq and this is way better).  Going to try their other location as they have gumbo there and a bigger selection on the menu."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food portions are excellent. I mistakingly ordered two dishes (because I have a huge appetite that most places can't match with one plate). I almost finished them both, but it was a challenge. The first item on the menu I got was the mammoth poutine with beef brisket. Because of my love for sweet potato fries, I requested the poutine this way. At first the waitress was opposed to the idea, saying I \"can't do that\" as it's a completely different menu item. I realized it might have been more expensive but I was willing to pay extra. After consulting with the manager, they put it together for me for only an extra 3 dollars. The other meal I got was the pulled pork salad which might as well have been called mammoth as well, as it was equally massive. Together, before tip, I spent less than 30 dollars which in my eyes is quite reasonable for the food I was given. My only \"beef\" with this place was that they didn't offer complimentary water (I was directed to disgusting Dasani fridge water). Luckily, I came prepared and had my own water bottle handy.  The establishment is a bit on the ghetto side, but hey, you can't have everything."}
{"text":"Everyone needs to visit their new location in Mississauga! Not only is the menu much bigger, but the Friday specials he once had at the first location, well they're everyday items now! Etoufee, jambalaya, gumbo, and yes, the best potato salad EVER! Oh and don't get me started on the banana creme Brule! !!"}
{"text":"I tried RD's for the first time a few months ago and the food was great. Finally a place in the suburbs that has food you only find in the city. We tried it a few weeks ago and our second time was not a good experience. We ordered yeah food in advance over the phone and when I went to pick it up there was a bit of a wait, which is fine at a place like this as they have a lot of customers.  When I finally got called up to pay for my order the lady who works the cash tells me that they gave my order by mistake to the customer before me and that I'll have to wait. Finally waited and they did not offer to \"compensate\" in any manner which was rather disappointing.   The worst part of all....the food was not prepared as requested and you could tell it was rushed. My wife and I were quite disappointed and will have to think twice before going here again....."}
{"text":"I had the 1/4 rib and 1lb wing,and I must say that it's delicious! The ribs were a bit tough on my braces but that's not their fault,and the wings were well made.Best part is the fact that it only cost me $14!Do take note that it's no fancy restaurant, and they have limited seating....also lacked A/C, but can't really complain. Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"We went after the dinner rush to pick up some take-out and it was delicious! Tender and flavorful pulled-pork and a medium heat quarter chicken! The corn bread and coleslaw was added for free because they liked us, and both were on point.  Looking forward to their larger, new location up the road, soon!"}
{"text":"So good... the bbq sauce is perfect and the cornbread is so soft. I recommend the mac and cheese also."}
{"text":"After living in the southern United States for several years I find most \"southern BBQ\" places in the GTA just don't cut it but I had a craving for some smoked beef brisket, southern baked beans and corn bread.  After a little internet research a co-worker and I headed to RD's Southern BBQ for lunch.  It is in a non-descript strip mall with adequate parking.    The place is small and very casual, besides for a few jazz posters to go with the jazz music and a few tables for dine in there is not much décor to speak of.   I walked up to the counter to order our selections from the chalk board; the \"Bad Habit\" sandwich; half beef brisket and half pulled pork, a side of beans and of course an order of corn bread.  We got it to go. With a couple of cokes, it came to 23 bucks.  The portions were huge and although we split everything there was enough food to more than satisfy us.  The Bad Habit was enormous, easily a pound of saucy, smoky meat between a large buttered bun.   There was no way to eat it as a sandwich it was piled so high.  The brisket was tender, with a delicious dry rub and a nice smoke layer through the meat. The pulled pork was a shredded slow roasted pork shoulder just as delicate as the brisket but very hardy.   Both were sauced generously with an obvious homemade sauce that was firmly southern BBQ with a hint of molasses and perhaps ginger(?).  The homemade baked beans were mixed with a more hardy version of the same sauce; throw in a few bits of pork and it would make a delicious meal on its own.    The corn bread is made in a brownie pan, but was surprising delicate with a few bits of corn throughout the square.  Enjoyably not as rich as some over buttered corn bread can be.  All and all, it was delicious, great value and in my opinion the best lunch place in Brampton."}
{"text":"Came here after a nice hike at Hilton Falls; a nice reward! I ordered a 1 lb. beef brisket with coleslaw while my friend ordered ribs.  Restaurant size: This place is...cozy, and doesn't appear to have A/C. Might not be pleasant on a hotter day, or on a really busy day.  Portion size: I hadn't had a pound of brisket before, but now I know what a feat it can actually be!   Service: Fast and friendly!  Food quality: It wouldn't be a BBQ place without BBQ sauce, and there is plenty of sauce. However, a little too much sauce for my liking; still good! The beef brisket was nicely cooked and wasn't overly dry. The coleslaw was freshly made and was a great counter to the onslaught of BBQ sauce...   Final thoughts: A nice place to grab some BBQ if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Hidden treasure in Mississauga. Food was delicious! The meat fell of the bone and so moist and flavourful. This is our first time here and will definitely come back. Excellent food and service."}
{"text":"Looks are deceiving with Rd's.. although it does add to it's charm.   I  don't think enough people dont know about this hidden gem nor have they had the chance to taste good southern food.. i guess it's brampton's demogrpahic.  This place should be packed 24/7.  Food is amazing and moderately priced. Portions are great and the people are fantastic. The owner is serious dude.. spoke with him until my food got cold.. the guy ended up giving me some free/extra chicken etc.    seriously.. if you're craving anything protein (chicken,pork,beef) or starch (potatoes, , macaroni, cornbread) go here.. you will not be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Wow! Absolutely blown away!!  Was picking food up for someone who swears by this place and this is now a favorite place of mine. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and ate bites of it on every stop light on the way home; needless to say, it was finished by the time I got there. The Mac and cheese was a perfect medium for the pulled pork sandwich. I can't wait to try out the beef brisket when I come back which will be very, very soon. It is family owned and the service was impeccable. I would give 10 stars if I could!!"}
{"text":"To go into a BBQ restaurant and order anything but BBQ is nothing short of insanity, akin to ordering pizza at a seafood restaurant. I second A.M.'s review, you will NOT find better than RD's for bbq in the GTA. Also please don't compare it to the South, the birthplace of bbq, that's like saying the French food was better in France, of course it was. The ribs at RD's could easily win a competition, they are perfection, so is the pulled pork, absolute heaven. This food is made with love and you can taste it. Anyone who has eaten their share of bbq knows that other sides can fall short but not here, mac & cheese is seriously great and everyone knows that's a hard thing to get right. Cornbread has just the right texture. Even the coleslaw which I typically won't even bother trying, surprised me because it was delicious. Even the fries were great for goodness sakes! This place is flawless. If you want a chicken sandwich and/or poutine, go to a food court. If you want the best bbq in the GTA then come here."}
{"text":"You would think you'd  have to travel downtown #Toronto for good BBQ. NOPE! #OnlyInBrampton can you find the best BBQ joint with years of experience, a family-run restaurant dishing up a variety of BBQ & Creole-Cajun cooking, and straight up good food * you have to check out @rdsbbq * go say what's up to the friendly family and check out their amazing menu. We were able to get some amazing ribs, cooked perfectly with a beautiful smoke, pulled pork and some coleslaw which had a nice bite. We missed out on the mac and cheese and cornbread * which sells out fast. Get your fingers sticky with some good BBQ   It's definitely a #RicksGoodEats   #BBQ #ribs #pulledpork #beef #summer #foodporn #fingerlickingood"}
{"text":"The food was great! Good smoke flavour and the sauce was delicious, 3 levels of heat! Baked beans were great! It would be nice to have some bits of smoked pork in it. They didn't have side sauces for the tables, but the food came with alot already on it. The meat was cooked nicely. Pulled pork was moist, chicken wasn't dry but I've had juicier bbq. Ribs were tender. Not the best ever, but still good.  They should have a sampler platter with all the meat types.  It's closer to 4.5 rating, but I will definatley be back if I am in the area! Will try the jerk sauces next time. Great place for BBQ in the GTA!"}
{"text":"This southern gal was absolutely delighted with the wonderful ribs & corn cake and super friendly service!!  I felt right at home as I licked my fingers clean.  I saved half of the giant slice of cornbread for breakfast, a southern tradition in my family.  Sadly, I don't think I'll order the beans again though.....one bite was more than enough.  But maybe it was just an off day?  I'll talk to the guy there tomorrow about them when I go back for the brisket....or pulled pork.  Decisions, decisions!"}
{"text":"My girl is vegetarian. I'm a carnivore. Just when I thought I'd be the only one to eat here, the chef made her a grilled salad....GRILLED SALAD! (See picture) This place is the x on a pirates map! Must visit. MUST. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Hard not to love this place.  Nothing different to add in here. Family owned, and ran with passion and love.  Moved out of Brampton a long time ago -- and I've never come across anything near this quality in the area."}
{"text":"Haven't found a more authentic Southern BBQ place in Toronto/GTA.  It's inexpensive, the ribs are great, and is the fried okra. Saturdays are beef rib days. Very special. Go around 2pm so you don't have to wait for a table (there are only like 5). It's a great treat."}
{"text":"An amazing find that happened randomly.  You have to try their pulled pork poutine, It's off the charts. I agree that this place should be filled 24/7 and speaking the chef alone will make me come back to this establishment again and again. They truly love what they do and its comes out in their food. My only negative is that their wings need a little more work."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Must eat the beef brisket sandwich with coleslaw. So good. Probably the best BBQ I've had in Toronto!!"}
{"text":"Frist time eating RD's and loved it, hot sauce is amazing , all the bbq was great and the big daddy burger was amazing"}
{"text":"This restaurant recently opened and is a spin off from their Brampton location. Today, I had a pulled pork sandwich that came with fries. The food seems to be the same as their original location; however, this location is larger and has a better interior.  I want to give them more than 3 stars; unfortunately, parts of my sandwich, while tasty, were a bit tough . My server was quite nice and helpful. I suspect that this restaurant will become quite successful and that there will be more RD's locations open in the future."}
{"text":"Wow! What an experience I had and my friends tonight. We had a feast on their patio. I had the smoked pull pork sandwich with the creamiest Mac & cheese. My hubbie had the BIG Daddy (signature sandwich) with fresh cut fries. My best gal pal had a grilled chicken with sauteed? vegetables with sweet potatoes fries. We all shared our delicious food. The smooth Jazz and the tasty cocktails on the evening patio were also the highlight of the night."}
{"text":"I came here to grab some takeout for lunch today. I tried their brisket sandwich (with medium sauce), their hand-cut fries and coleslaw. Everything was delicious and the portions are huge - especially the sandwich. The fries remind me of old school KFC fries. They're very potatoey and somewhat soft. If you wanted them crisper, I suppose you could ask for them well done, but I really liked them as is. I love when fries actually taste like potatoes.   Just a couple pointers:  1. The menu has expanded since my first visit. I had heard a couple grumbles from some people last time that they didn't have the same items at this location as the Brampton location. That no longer seems to be the case. The menu at this location seems to have all the special Brampton items now.   2. I did recommend to the super nice woman taking my order that they might want to put up a couple signs directing people who want takeout to the takeout line and people who wanted to dine-in to either seat themselves or wait to be seated, as the case might be.   I honestly couldn't tell what the seating style was. Last time the waitress had told me and my dining companion to sit wherever we wanted, but that's after she had seen us and the restaurant was pretty sparse at that time. It would be helpful for new diners to know the procedure since there isn't a dedicated hostess and the old Wendy's restaurant format can be a bit confusing for new people coming in."}
{"text":"I went there with high expectations tonight and was totally disappointed.  I had to wait 25 minutes for my order and there were only 5 people in the restaurant.  On top of that, they got my order wrong and charged me $16 for 6 chicken wings, when I ordered the beef brisket.  Asked for the hot BBQ sauce on the side and receive nothing.  Not worth the time to go."}
{"text":"Location was somewhat sketchy but food was excellent! Best wings I've had in a LONG time."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at RD's Southern BBQ with three friends. My sandwich, Dean Bad Habit, was piled high with brisket and pulled pork. The brisket was a bit dry, but the pulled pork was perfect! (After 5 years in Houston, TX, I *know* BBQ.) The fries were OK, and the slaw was good... but very small compard to sides in a real Southern BBQ joint.  My husband got the Mammoth Poutine with pulled pork, minus the cheese. He liked the pulled pork, thought the fries could have had a bit less time in the fryer, and the gravy was OK (but likely out of a jar or from a powder mix).  Our friends... One got Southern Friday Chicken with mashed potatoes, and he liked both; two got a rack of ribs, felt they were good, but slightly overcooked.  All in all, we liked, and my husband and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here because I heard that they had good chicken sandwiches. Their Grilled Chicken sandwich was not disappointing. It was seasoned very well and the vegetables had a bit of balsamic sauce. A really big sandwich. The coleslaw was also very good. Only issue i had was when I walked in I did not know what the seating style was. I actually wanted to dine-in but i saw a few people at the takeout counter so I went ordered take-out. Only until a few min later a few more people came did the server asked if it was dine-in or take-out. Overall was food was great and the server was nice too."}
{"text":"We are always so happy when we come here!  They honestly have some of the best BBQ food I've tried.  Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"This is a small unpretentious spot is a strip mall across from a high school. I had their beef brisket today and had their pulled pork on an earlier visit. It is well worth visiting even though I do not like this type of food as much as some of their fans do. The food probably rates 4 stars, but the interior only rates 1 star, thus my 3 star rating. They will soon open a larger stand-alone restaurant on Hurontario near Derry. Their second restaurant should be well worth visiting when it opens."}
{"text":"I wondered in for their Wednesday  lunch special  after driving by a few times. I had the Jerk Chicken Taco. It was really tasty and spicy. It was three tacos. I would like to have had fries included in that special just to make it a but more filling but other wise it was delicious.   The service was great. I will  definitely return to try other menu options."}
{"text":"We decided to check out the place because the positive reviews they've got.  We were so disappointed after tasting the food. We ordered ribs, chicken and some rice, none of the food was hot (temperature), I expected \"off of grill\" hot, but it's just warm.  The ribs are not fall-off bones tender either. On positive note, the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Best pulled pork sandwiches around, period. The staff is always happy and bubbly, and the food is always a hit with our staff when we order take out for the office. Their coleslaw is great too"}
{"text":"This is the best smokehouse BBQ creole restaurant in the GTA hands down, they have the most amazing selection of food, friendly staff and a nice ambiance to the place,   Recommend the el chapo burger it's amazing, it ruined other burgers for me because it's so good"}
{"text":"Great to have a southern bbq place locally. The staff were excellent in delivering customer service. The food itself was delicious, especially the pulled pork. We've had better chicken wings and it would have been better if they had multiple sauces, but it was still very good!"}
{"text":"I live in Brampton, I am from North Carolina, barbecue is very popular there. I went today for the first time to RD's. The food was fabulous! The pulled pork is very moist and lean and very good flavor! The cole slaw was wonderful as was the baked beans, the corn bread was delicious. The man and women working there are very friendly and eager to please. I highly recommend this place and will be returning to try some of the other things such as ribs and chicken."}
{"text":"I discovered this place at Brampton's Rib 'n' Roll festival and I must say, the food is absolutely fantastic.    When the new location opened up, my friends and I went there for lunch right away as I highly recommended it based on my prior experience.  The Good: - The food tastes amazing.  Possibly the best I've had. - The portions. If you can finish the Mammoth Poutine, you deserve a trophy. - Location. - Lots of parking. - Lots of seating space.  The Bad: - Poor signage. - Terrible service.  I'm not sure about dinner having only been at lunch, but there seems to always be the same few servers and staff present and in my experience. The servers seem uninterested and unenthusiastic, they often forget who ordered what & don't bother to write it down.  Sometimes it takes several minutes just to be greeted and seated and several more just to be approached for drink orders.  There's often not even cutlery on the tables when the food arrives.  All in all, if you're not in a rush and don't care about friendly or motivated wait staff, the food is still excellent and your wallet will be ok too.  It's not bad if you've set the right expectations."}
{"text":"A friend of mine had been raving about RDs for a little while now and I decided to try them out today.   The customer service was great. Cutest cashier, very personable and friendly. One of the chefs also came out and asked if it had been my first time and how I'd heard about the spot which was nice.  The Big Daddy: A humongous sandwich filled with flavorful chicken breast and some breaded and fried jumbo shrimp. The sandwich was really good. I actually had to remove some chicken from it just so I could \"finish\" eating it (I'll eat it later in a homemade wrap or on top of a salad). It came topped with lettuce, tomato and also had red peppers and sweet onions on the bottom. No complaints here.  The Mac & Cheese: Exactly as the name states. Mac. And. Cheese. It was nice and creamy as it should be but I felt it was lacking something. Like it should have had some cayenne pepper or something. After all it's RDs \"Southern\" BBQ right? Easy fix was to add some hot sauce.  The Coleslaw: Though it was sweet and crunchy, it had a weird aftertaste. I don't know if it was the pickles or what. It was good... But something was off.  All in all, I will go back another day as I have my eye on the mammoth poutine and I've heard the pulled pork is the best."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon. The wait staff was attentive and the service was quick. I tried the shrimp Po Boy a side of mac and cheese, and coleslaw. The shrimp Po Boy was well made with fresh tomatoes lettuce, onion, red pepper, deep fried shrimp, and remoulade sauce  the bun was better than some I have had locally but still not in-keeping with a good traditional Po Boy.  The mac and cheese was also good with some baked cheddar on top.   All in all a good lunch. Will plan to stop by again and try out some more of their menu."}
{"text":"Quick Review:   My brother and I tried RD's for the first time, last Friday night, and it was fantastic.   The food is Authentic Southern cuisine, and so was the hospitality .  We ordered 2 Dean's bad habit sandwiches, and 1 lbs of smoked jerk wings.  The portions were huge, neither of us could finish the mammoth sandwiches. or the wings, so took the leftovers home..   If you like southern food or just want to try a BBQ joint, this would be the place  Overall  Food-Excellent  Customer service -Excellent Portions -Excellent Value-Excellent  I would return to this place for sure , I am fan   PS. The restaurant is very simple and modest, also the service could get little slow when busy, but it is worth it..."}
{"text":"Went during a Saturday evening and sat on the patio.  Service was very slow but friendly.  Took 15 mins to get drinks and water from first seating.   Only two beers available - Moosehead at $18.99 and house Pilsner at $15.99 a pitcher.  Quarter chicken dinners were tasty at $10.50 a plate.   Ordered an Etoufee dish with lobster arm, two small crab claws, 6 shrimp on rice and gravy for $19.00 which was so so.   Catfish poboy sandwich with fries and slaw for $13.00 was very good and fresh.  Finally got two desserts at $5.00 each which were caramel bead pudding and caramel cheesecake.   These desserts were the best value and tasty!    Servers seemed overwhelmed when we went there even as customers dwindled later in the night.    Definetly a place to check out once.....not sure about it being a regular spot.   Ambiance inside restaurant isnt that great, but outside is more bar and patio style and more open."}
{"text":"Great beef ribs! Sauce is really good. Had a few other items like the shrimp and potatoes boy and all pretty good."}
{"text":"The weather is hot and sticky, the voice of the amazing Billie Holiday is in the air, and you have worked up the appetite of a bear... It's Louisiana cerca 1950 and Mama Dean has the outside fire stove going, whipping up her famous homemade BBQ sauce and Papa is in the back smoking meat...   Ok, so we are really in Brampton in a small Southern restaurant hidden in a plaza on Kennedy Rd just off Queen St, but lets not spoil the authenticity of our experience...   I cleverly got my beau to try out yelp this afternoon on our usual hunt for a new place to eat lunch. He took one look at this place and we got in the car, no question 'bout it!  We were greeted by two young men behind the tall counter taking orders and making food... One of them stirring up a very large pot of their famous BBQ sauce they make every couple days. We chose seats near the back of the restaurant and began to peruse the one page menu. Mouths' watering, we decided to share the following:  - Dean Bad Habit: Tender, juicy pieces of pulled pork combined with another great juicy piece of beef brisket with medium spiced BBQ sauce. This is one LARGE sandwich as the menu warns.  - Mac n/ cheese - I don't know what is all in here but the flavors mesh well and the textures.... It's a heavenly thing...I will never go back to Kraft Dinner, EVER! - Coleslaw: creamy but light tasting, fresh cabbage salad.  My guy took several bites of the sandwich with sauce escaping the sides of his mouth... He was absolutely speechless. I have never seen him like this... then it was my turn for a bite...  READY?!! OOOOOOOMMMMMMGGGGGGG!!  I have had Southern cooking before, but let me tell you, NOTHING, has awakened my taste buds like this place did. The flavors played a perfect symphony, warm, soothing notes followed by staccato and crescendo-ing moments of joy!   With my eyes closed, I was now in the heart of Louisiana at Mama Dean's family BBQ, surrounded by good home cooking and loving family! I love when food gives you an experience that overwhelms all senses! This is a family run business, dad has a smoker in the back for the meat and the boys run the front, while mom gets busy with catering a wedding.   Remember, we ordered a food platter for \"one\" person but they were definitely sharable portions! We were both stuffed after we left there...and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went there for the first time today. The service was amazing and the food was even better. My bf got the rib and creole shrimp platter with sweet potato fries and I got the one pound brisket platter with mac and cheese. At first I thought the prices were kind of high. But once we got the food we saw why. Our server explained to us that everything was made in house and fresh. You could definitely taste the difference. The owner/chef also came out and spoke with us. He was super nice. It's nice to see that we're putting our money towards a family business. I highly recommend this place. The decor leaves a lot to be desired but otherwise the food is what matters."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. We learned about them at the farmers market. The staff are very friendly, the location is a little rough but when the food is this good, who cares."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Mississauga RDs as we loved the Branpton location so much we wanted to try it out.   I had no idea it was going to be a sit down place so it was a great surprise to see and it was clean and looked rather new inside.   The staff were all so friendly! Wonderful people are working there that seem to really enjoy what they do. Our waitress even seemed to go above and beyond when she made me my own hot sauce mixture - which she said she had never done before and it was great (I'd buy a bottle of that haha).   Our food was great and my husband has been going on about his big daddy sandwich for the past two days - so he's definitely a big fan of that one. If you like chicken and shrimp you should give it a try. I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was great. Fries were delicious too.   The drinks are pretty expensive. I probably won't order even pop there for $3 but the food prices are definitely fair.  Highly recommend! Definitely try it out if you're in the mood for some smoked BBQ!"}
{"text":"A great BBQ place down the street from our hotel.  The homemade medium BBQ sauce is legit (just the right amount of kick). You can taste the smoke on the pulled pork and beef brisket. The mac 'n cheese is some of the best I have ever had. The cheese had the perfect amount of gooey to it.  Our server was awesome as well. She gave us a sample of the BBQ sauce to try before ordering and was wonderful to talk with.  I will absolutely return when in the area again."}
{"text":"First time here. You weren't lying bout the Homemade Hot Sauce being HOTTT. We need this Newfoundland."}
{"text":"Walked in on a hot summers day to grab a bite on my first visit and ended up getting take out due to the outrageous temperature in there. There was clearly no air conditioning and don't no how customers were able to tolerate the heat!  Ordered a shrimp po boy and a side of Mac and cheese.  Mac and cheese: reeeeally runny and a not very cheesy at all. I'm not sure what the flavor was that I was unable to detect, but I wasn't able to finish the bowl as it was rather unappetizing.  Po boy: the bun to inside ratio wasn't very good. Huge bun, very little inside stuff. 2 huge shrimps, another strange sauce and not all what I expect from a Po Boy. Portion size was decent but unfortunately it was of strange, non southern tasting food.  Will not b returning."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure To stop in and eat some southern bbq!  The ribs were fall off the bone good!  I need to know if anyone has been to both?  I found the one on Kennedy to be better.  Either way both great.  Enjoy the old Wendy's exterior with a southern smelling interior!  Service 9/10 Ambience 6/10 Experience 8/10. (Other location 9.5)  Love both either way!  It's like choosing between your kids who is more favoured!  Answer the one that is quiet!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. A really nice family run establishment. We need more of this type of dining experience and move away from the boring big chain places."}
{"text":"We had  their Shrimp Po Boy sandwich and their beef ribs....both are absolutely delicious. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"This place is more of a 3.5/5 stars than a 3.   We kinda made out own sampler platter by getting 2lb wings and 1/2 rack ($26), a pulled pork sandwich, fries ($2.50), and Mac and cheese ($3.50). Their medium sauce (on the wings) really complimented the herbs the wings were marinated in. If you're looking for spicy, the medium is not it. But it was still really good, like lick the sauce off your fingers good. The mild sauce (on the ribs) was also good, it had a nice little tang to it. The fries are excellent, even when soggy (we took our food to go and got soft by the time we ate it). The ribs were a bit dry but had enough sauce to make up for it."}
{"text":"Been going here for awhile and finally got to putting in a review. Most of what can be said probably has, so I'll only add that I'm very grateful to have a place like this locally. The owners are incredibly nice and they make sure to put out the real deal. Try Fridays when he does cajun specialties. I had slow cooked Turkey leg, cajun-style - and where else are you going to find that? I love the Po' Boy and the 'dirty rice' too. Only a somewhat cautionary note: the ambience is below par, but I still don't feel it's fair to lower the rating. In a perfect world, they'd find a financial partner in order to be able to have a nicer location and still provide the same quality food in a nicer setting."}
{"text":"It was all so good. The burger was humongous, the mac and cheese tasted like some creamy pasta, the cheesy top gave it a pizza-ish taste and the corn bread was perfect."}
{"text":"I've only had ribs and cornbread from here! The ribs were excellent, not over cooked and just really flavourful! Cornbread was good, but mine is better :p I'd give 5* if it wasn't so expensive!"}
{"text":"Man I absolutely love this place. Their po boy catfish is beyond amazing...the softness of the fish matched with their sauce and bun is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! *drools. Just thinking of it makes me happy hehehe...and I love their mac n cheese. The food takes a bit long but let me tell you, I'm an impatient person and I'm telling you ITS WORTH THE WAIT!!   Personally I love this location better than their Hurontario one.   If this was useful than you're welcome :) if you don't try it...YOURE MISSING OUT!!! (Sorry for screaming, I'm a passionate yelper....and I love this place!!)"}
{"text":"This has got to be the one of the best hidden gems anywhere in the GTA. If you're looking for authentic southern food,  this is as close as you're going to get. The ribs are fall off the bone fantastic and the wings are juicy and full of flavor. Lastly, the service is friendly and the people are great and make you feel very welcome."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years ever since their location was back in brampton and the food has never disappointed. I normally stick to my favourite which is the grilled chicken sandwich with the best sweet potato fries ive ever had. I normally order a side of corn bread as well since its always so fresh and moist.  They do have an alcoholic menu if thats something you typically look for. They have done a decent job to make an inviting patio.   The service could be better as the servers are not very attentive and the wait time to receive your order is long for the amount of people that were at the restaurant at the time. However, as everything is made fresh, I can put up with it since I always know im going to have a great meal here.  Price wise.... I think this is a great place with big portions and reasonably prices.   Ive been wanting to try their dessert for some time but have always been too full to order one.  They have sweet potatoes pie and bread pudding if you want to try something different."}
{"text":"Good BBQ here. I had the full rack of ribs, medium spicy, and the sauce was quite good. The ribs weren't exactly fall off the bone like I was hoping, but they were still worth it."}
{"text":"Ribs had a nice smokey taste and were perfectly cooked. Fall off the bone tender. Beef brisket was very good. Wonderful taste and perfect amount of BBQ sauce to give it a nice finish. Pulled pork had amazing texture - not too stringy and not to over cooked. I will order from here again."}
{"text":"The closest you can get to authentic BBQ in the GTA. Just a short trip up hurontario from the 401. As a new location it is still trying to find its ambience but the food makes up for anything it lacks in that area. Everything is great on the menu, so try a combo platter for your first outing."}
{"text":"On what has been one of the coldest weeks in recent memory a group of fearless Yelpers decided to have a get together (Unofficial Yelp Event) to basically get together and have some great BBQ.    Walking into RD's you can already smell the wonderful food.  It's that wonderful smell that takes you to another place whether it be summer time or the smell that reminds you of fond memories with family in a backyard or a celebration in an open green space for a nostalgic great time like a picnic.  For me it brought me back to driving by smoke houses on Wears Valley Road near Sevierville, Tennessee.    Yes that smell is all you need to know about how much work and effort is put into the quality of this food.  I often mention but it goes without saying that smell is connected to taste.  What you smell is what you taste and in this place the mere anticipation of what you can smell will already get the juices flowing.  This place RDs could make money of just bottling up that scent and making it available for your Glade Plug In devices and such.    This place is 100% Ron Swanson approved.  If you don't know who that is, look it up and watch Parks and Recreation... because it's a funny show and Nick Offerman is the man.    The menu consists mostly if not all of BBQ and the types of sides that go with it.  While I didn't try any of the sides I had my chance to since our party ordered a lot of food and we shared among us.    Being the greedy bastard I am when it comes to all things good I had ordered 2 dishes this fine evening.  For my appetizer I ordered the catfish Po Boy sandwich which was 8 dollars.  I saw this on the menu and I simply had to have it.  HAD TO HAVE IT.  The one time and only time I've been to New Orleans for an extended weekend I ended up eating this sandwich 3 times because I loved it so.  This was 21 years ago and change.  Catfish is something you don't commonly see on any menu where I live so yes I will order this just for nostalgia's sake.    The sandwich was very good and also very generous.  The breading was crispy and not too overwhelming.  The bread was fresh as were the garnishes but overall it was what I had wanted.  I had added some of the Scotch bonnet/ghost pepper homemade sauce on the sandwich and I swear I had died and gone to heaven.  Hold on I still have my main to eat before I leave this world...  ...I had ordered a half rack of ribs and beef brisket as well.  This was 21 dollars and came with a small side of coleslaw.  The slaw is very creamy which I really like.  I am not fan of vinegary cole slaw, only creamy and this was great.  The kind that if added to your sandwich would definitely lubricate it.  The ribs were given in 2 quarter pieces since the server thought I had ordered a quarter rack so they just added another quarter to make a half (4 and 4 bones = 8).  The ribs were of a good size, I'm assuming they were side ribs and they were meaty and had some weight to them.  They seemed a little dry but the sauce countered that.  The sauce was done right... of course to the point where they stick.  I would have liked them maybe a little juicier but smoked for an extended amount of time is the method so they come out drier than what I'm used to making at home.  The meat here is smoked slowly and sauced after.     The brisket is also slow smoked and sauced as well.  I was given about maybe 6 or 7 slices of brisket drizzled with a very smokey and tangy sauce.  This can only be described as the beef version of bacon for how much I enjoyed this.  Again a little on the drier side but again slow smoked and sauced.    The tastes are great and I can only eat and order so much.  Other dishes ordered by our party were dishes with pulled pork, a mammoth poutine topped with pulled pork, and various sides such as slaw, mac and cheese, baked beans etc.  The staff and owner are very down to earth, friendly, personable and proud to be serving what they are serving.  It's obvious that they are no rookies when it comes to the art of cooking meat.    Their menu has larger combination type or family type portions as well.  They also offer a catering service for large parties etc and offer local delivery.  Molson Canadian and Corona is offered as beer.  RD's basically has what you need to fulfill your meat cravings during a time when I don't want to BBQ outside.  This is an open all year kind of place so you know what, open all year means go all year.  This is a gem in the western GTA no doubt.  I will have different items when I return next time but so far, so great.  All around it's is 5* experience.  I originally gave them a 4 but this is one of the very few times I will round it up.  By the way they are opening another location in the Hurontario and Derry Road area in April we were told..."}
{"text":"I've been to a bunch of BBQ places in the south during my lifetime and the BBQ world is very wide as far as styles and flavors.  Carolina is one way, Tennessee is another, and while I haven't had KC in KC or Texas in Texas there's so much diversity when it comes to this particular cuisine.    Toronto is not in the south it never will be and it's just not that kind of place.  What may or may not be generally accepted as \"authentic\" BBQ is not part of our culture and that is so open to interpretation anyway.  That being said I really like RDs not only for their version of BBQ but also for the value and customer service.  Located recessed and tucked away from both Hurontatio and Derry it is near that intersection, sort of... This Aventura Court address while sort of not as visible from either main road it's there, in a building that looks like it used to be a Wendy's footprint or something like that.  Compared to the previous location in Brampton which was basically a cramped strip mall footprint with barely seating for 20, this new location can easily seat maybe a hundred and now has a more comfortable dining area for groups.  This is important because THIS review is based on a group experience which is something you couldn't really have as a sit down experience at the old place in Brampton.  Now I recall the food from the old location and it was also good as well.  Regardless that it's closed now I also gave that spot 5 stars.  The personable nature of the owners on top of the amazing food was what made it easy to give them top honors.  This newer location while having the family feel to it also made it easy for me to select RD's as a place I took a group of my family to have dinner.    I had called ahead of time to ask if they were able to seat of 8 with as little as 20 minutes notice.  I was told yes.  It was a Saturday evening at about 830pm when we arrived.  The place was already about 3/4 full with many other patrons already enjoying their dinners and drinks.    My family had decided we'd do the family thing and go with the group deal and the largest one at that which is listed to feed up to 12 people.  Mind you we were only 8 but I figured some of us are big eaters and there's nothing wrong with left overs.  The Max and Henry's Good Time is listed as the following:  \"2 Full Racks of Ribs, 2lbs of Wings, 2lbs of Beef Brisket, 2 lbs Pulled Pork, Beans, Coleslaw, Cornbread, Sauce, Mac n Cheese and Hush Puppies\".   This group deal on the menu is 144 dollars.  For 12 people that breaks out to 12 dollars each!  That's about the price of a double burger combo at some fast food places right?  Though there was only 8 of us that's still under 20 bucks a person for a full sit down family style meal.  Now that the value is covered let's get down to the food.  The first thing that came was the hush puppies.  These were good, not too greasy and we were served well over a dozen on a platter as a starter.    After that a plate of cornbread and bowl of creamy coleslaw came out.  The cornbread was a nice texture.  There were about a half dozen squares which were cut about 4 x 4 inches each.  The slaw great.   Shortly after the ribs, all the rest of the meat and the beans also were served.  We didn't wait very long after the initial hush puppies for everything to come out basically at once but it took several trips for all the platters to come to the table but we were digging in pretty fast.  So fast in fact I had to stop to take photos!    The ribs were 2 full racks 2 different ways one mild and one medium.  We had hotter BBQ sauce on the side for those that like it spicier (like me).  The other meat (2 lbs of pulled pork, 2 lbs of wings and 2 lbs of brisket) was all on another platter.  The mac and cheese was huge.  Basically the platters are so large that passing them around is not really practical.  For the most part we were either passing down some items or walking up to the platters to help ourselves because they are too big and heavy for some to pass around as easily.    The ribs were so good.  I love making ribs myself and I totally loved the sauce they used.  The brisket wasn't dry like I've had at other places.  Yes there was tangy sauce on the cuts but that's the way I like it.  The wings were also sauced up and the pulled pork was delicious.  All the meat had great taste to it, not just sauced taste on top.  The pulled pork and brisket were probably my favorite of all of them while the mac and cheese was rich and filling.  Now while all this overwhelming food was going on we couldn't be asked enough if things were going good and if we had everything we needed.  The server was very attentive and took care of us just fine.  Petra who I spoke to on the phone to make the reservation also stopped by and made sure we were happy with everything.  Overall I like RDs not just for the food but for the value and service.  My family were all happy with RDs as well and it would be an easy sell to come back for more BBQ."}
{"text":"I used to live in the southern US. And wow. This place. Nails the slow and steady and comfort food that I've been missing. Omg. The collards.... the ribs....the fried chicken...the ONLY thing that was missing was the Unsweet iced tea. And it's a bit slow but when you know what's coming....totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"We came in for an early dinner as a group of 8. Service was a bit slow but I liked the laidback feeling of the place. The food was okay with nothing I haven't had before. The Poutine was massive in size but lacking anything distinctive; actually, it fell a bit flat of expectations, fries were soggy and sauce was salty with little cheese curd. I also had the brisket, was not a fan because I found it just a heap of meat...The pulled pork and ribs seemed like a group favourite though. We also had the chance to enjoy the live music which is always fun and adds to the experience. Will come back to try other offerings on the menu..."}
{"text":"I came here for a UYE organized by fellow Yelper Ryan F.    My order: beef brisket and 1/4 rack of ribs plus a side of beans.  I thought the ribs were pretty good, but I've never been a huge ribs fan in general.  However, the BRISKET, wow, OMG! This was the best beef brisket I ever had. The sauce had a nice smokey/bbq flavour to it.  I didn't have bread with my order, but when I finished the brisket and had so much sauce left, my friend was kind of enough to spare her bread.  Eating this white bread with sauce was absolutely delicious! It reminded me of an awesome sloppy joe.    I also tried some Mac N Cheese and some hush puppies (corn fritters).  The hush puppies were fried perfectly but the Mac N Cheese, this was delicious. I'm not sure what kind of cheese it was, but it seemed a lot tastier than cheddar.  It felt like fancy Mac N Cheese.   Overall, I'd give the food a 4/5, however the owner and the chef are super super nice and chill.  I literally felt like family there.  They were very patient with our big group as a few of us arrived at 6:45 and we didn't really order until 7:30.  Whenever we asked questions, they were happy to answer and also joked around with us.    It was a great experience and because of the super chill owner, I'll boost it up to 5 stars. :-)"}
{"text":"Well that was much better than expected! When u walked in it was not a pretty place but it was packed so I knew it has to be good! Got a full rack of ribs, wings, mammoth poutine and Mac and cheese! Fed 4 ppl for $50 ! So good I liked the Mac n cheese the best!! Yum ! Will go back! Def order before going if getting takeout"}
{"text":"I stopped in this place after seeing reviews. I was quite surprised. The bbq was good. It wasn't great, but I lived in North Carolina for 30 years, so I'm a little bias. Overall, I was very pleased with the quality of the meat and flavor. Good smoke for a place that doesn't have a pit."}
{"text":"Sorry, 2nd visit was not good.  Took home 1/2 slab of ribs and they were almost inedible , tough, not tender at all.. I guess undercooked.. Corn bread I can make better with my eyes closed. Coleslaw is a rip off. Brisket is not good either... We're so underserved when I comes to GOOD BBQ in GTA."}
{"text":"RD's Barbecue, southern comfort, great service, loving people, awesome food. We made our second visit; my wife, daughter and I visited RD's today.  We had the Mammoth Poutine with pulled pork and beef brisket on the side with corn bread.  The portion we got could feed six of us comfortably.   One mouthful and I was ecstatic, it is insanely delicious!  Oh my goodness, I could taste the actual smoked meat, it was out of this world delicious!  What can I say about the beef brisket..OMG!!  With or without the special BBQ sauce the taste was just plain NUTS!!  Smoked to perfection, taste buds tantalizingly delicious.  My wife and daughter with every bite said wow!  Cooked to a perfect texture and taste, I am hooked for life.  Thank you RD's Southern BBQ.  I will be back again and again to sample all that you have on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a while and have to agree that it's pretty great. It's not often you find cool, unique food like this in Brampton!  Firstly, the service is incredible. I was greeted almost instantly. It was an oddly busy night but the lady who served me made time to tell me \"I'll be right with you next\" in between running food to a table. After I ordered, it took about 15 minutes to get my food, but the staff apologized for this without me saying a peep; it was clearly just because it was a busy day and so I had no problem with the wait at all.  I ordered the Dean Bad Habit sandwich. Which was insanely huge. Tons of pulled pork and brisket, which was delicious. I had to eat it with a fork to get it to a manageable size. But by that time the bottom of the bun was soft and a little soggy from the pound or so of meat. Which leads me to my only criticism. The meat was incredible, even the small side of coleslaw it was served with may have been the best coleslaw I ever had... but a sandwich like this was served on a store-bought hamburger bun? The bun just wasn't worthy of the toppings on it!  Overall, I am really glad I tried this place and will definitely be going back, probably many times."}
{"text":"The food at RD's is always great and the portions are huge. I always order the shrimp Po Boy with a side of mac and cheese.  I'm only giving my most recent experience at the Aventura location 3 stars out of 5 simply because of the service. I dined with a group of three on a Saturday evening and when we first arrived, there were two other parties of the same size already seated. We were able to order our food in a timely matter however that was the last time anything in this visit was timely.  The waitress was the only one working the dining room and was noticeably scrambled. The restaurant started to get busier and busier and while it is understandable that it would be overwhelming to be the only one waiting multiple tables, her mood started to change with the more patrons that came in. She showed no interest in helping the parties that had arrived earlier than others and left us waiting to pay our bill with the credit machine for 15+ minutes.  The location from what I have seen has been open for a few months now so who I'm assuming was the manager was apologizing for the amount of staff that they had.   If you want bang for your buck then try this place out but honestly in terms of service and atmosphere, it's nothing to be excited about."}
{"text":"Was very impressed by the Ribs, they fell of the bone and had some very good BBQ sauce...the coleslaw was good and the cornbread tasted fresh.  The owners were nice and the food was good.  Was very happy that I did not have to wait 20 minutes for my meal like you are forced to do at Memphis BBQ in Woodbridge, with that said the prices here are more than Memphis for back ribs (Memphis serves side) which is eye-brow raising and kept them from getting a five  I will definitely be back when I have some time and am in Brampton  (Went a 2nd time and it seems like the spicy BBQ sauce I like so much if jerk chicken sauce)"}
{"text":"i had their brisket sandwich with their coleslaw on the side and it was filling. I feel like something was missing though I couldnt put my finger on it. the coleslaw was surprisingly tasty.. had sone banana aroma to it or something. will come back for ribs!"}
{"text":"I've had BBQ brisket all over the southern USA and I have to say this place does it the best and it's in Canada!"}
{"text":"Food:  I have no idea as I have not tasted anything from this place  Why One Star???: For wasting my precious time and gas.  Yelp review website is a major, and arguably the most ubiquitous review forum on the internet when it comes to community restaurants.  Yet the owner of RD is too lazy or has ulterior motive in not notifying the customers and would be customers that he shut down this location.  Either way is is very irresponsible.  I drove and took my precious lunch time to go there.    It was weird when I walked in.  I saw an Asian guy eating subway sandwich while working on his laptop.  There were people congregating to have discussions.  I was there still confused bc there was no sign that said it is closed for business.  Finally I asked the guy at the cash counter, and he told me this location was closed for food.  Thanks a lot lazy owner.  I hope you will contact Yelp to let them know this location is closed for food business.  Also you could have saved me from further wasting my time, if you had put up a sign in your old location.  Maybe you have no control over this location, but God sake, let Yelp know you moved and your old location is closed.  If you were me, and you drove to this location, after seeing the Yelp review, and find out it was closed, you would be disappointed and upset.  I will update this review once I check out your new location....  BB"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal food. We went in on the strength of a relatives recommendation. We opted for take out but will be back to dine in very soon! We ordered two rib entrees and a big daddy sandwich with fries. I gotta say RD's has the best ribs I've tried in all of the GTA without a doubt.  Everything from the service to the last bite of food was amazing. My ribs had medium spiced bbq sauce and were cooked to perfection  The ribs weren't fatty or oversauced or under sauced. They were finger licking good. My daughter loved her mild sooiced bbq ribs and said the fries were yummy. I had a side of mashed potatoes and gravy and both were delicious. I had a bite of the big daddy sandwich and it was very tasty and filling and the shrimps on the burger were huge!  I wasn't a big fan of the slaw only because I could taste pickles it and I'm not much of a pickles fan but other than that it was good. The cornbread was so delicious. Very moist and not dry like I've had at other places. I wish I'd gotten a second piece haha.  Overall the portion size for the price is very fair and more than enough. The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming. Staff is friendly and personable. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting some good bbq and if highly suggest the ribs.  I can't wait to go back and try more they have to offer."}
{"text":"So I had bookmarked this place a few weeks ago when i was seriously craving some good southern bbq.   I called up some of my friends and we went there on a Saturday night. mmm where to start... I don't give many restaurants 5 stars, but I feel like RD's deserve it.  The food is amazing, spicy (if you like), flavorful, homecooked and hits the spot!   their menu is not massive but includes staples plus more like ribs, chicken, corn bread, brisket, pulled pork, hush puppies, po'boys, Chicken wings, jambalaya, gumbo and SALADS lol  We tried almost everything on their menu. The ribs were saucy and fall of the bone, brisket was tender and flavorful, the pulled pork had just the right amount of sweetness, their chicken wings were large in size and taste, their Dean bad Habit sandwich is no joke (puled pork and beef brisket) and their chicken was cooked well. Their side mac and cheese wasn't too big and tasted great. Their corn bread was the only part of the meal I didn't care too much for, but i also like to heat mine up normally before eating.  We even ordered a salad for health concern :)  The restaurant isn't big and doesn't have a lot of seating, although they are soon changing locations to a larger restaurant with a patio. The place was clean and the people behind the counter were nice and helpful. Instead of letting my friend order the Dean Bad Habit off the bat, they warned her that it might be too much for her to eat and she can choose from a list of smaller (less expensive) sandwiches, so the honesty was appreciated. We also got some free bottles of water and hot sauce (she asked my sister \"how\" spicy and came up with the perfect amount... ie makes me sweat but she loves it)   Next time I'll try the beef ribs (a guy held it up while we were there and it was the size of a small chicken) and gumbo :)"}
{"text":"I love it here.  Every time I come, I end up getting the pulled pork, fried okra, fries, and that usually holds me over.  The waiters / waitresses are very attentive to your every need and make sure that if you have any issues with your meal that they know so they can improve and make the place better than it already is.  I definitely recommend coming here if you have a craving for southern comfort food. I may not be from the south, but gosh darn, this place is absolutely amazing for what it's worth, and the price to portion comparison is amazing. You get really large portions for a fair price.  If you're ever in the area, give the place a try, you'll definitely want to come back, and continue coming back like I do!"}
{"text":"Gave this place a 4 before, now its a 2.  Tried dining in and it was pretty aweful.  They don't put bbq sauces on their tables and that is a definite minimum and requirement for a bbq restaurant.  They also refuse to give you water.  They make you buy bottled water which is just tacky I think.  Providing glasses of water is also a definite minimum and requirement.  Food was also pretty mediocre this time.  They just don't meet the minimums anymore."}
{"text":"I felt like I was at ribfest!!!! :) the ribs and pulled pork were amazing!  Considered my favourite ribs now! I was very impressed with the service and quality/taste of their food. The restaurant itself is in a small plaza. It's a very small location. It's nothing fancy but the food makes up for everything :)"}
{"text":"Fast service, good food amazing prices, good crowd and good vibe to the place they also have ufc night. No cover :-)"}
{"text":"Finally decided to try out this place after spending most of the afternoon looking up restaurants on yelp.  We arrived just before 6.  I wasn't expecting much with the atmosphere as according to some reviews that it is a no frills spot.  it was a bit complicated to get to it as you do have to go thru a Tim Hortons/Gas station entrance to get to it.  It was fairly empty except for another table who were just leaving.  We were greeted by friendly staff.  Seems that one of them was the owner.  They sat us down in a booth.    Food:  We ordered a full rack of back ribs with fries and coleslaw, Shrimp Po'boy a with fries and coleslaw and a side order of mac and cheese.  The portions were huge.  The price was reasonable.  I found the ribs a little dry in certain spots probably because they were quite lean but they were tasty.  My hubby and I decided that they were probably not smoked.  We didn't notice any smoke rings.  The fries were crispy.  The Shrimp Po'boy, I've never had it before so I don't have anything to compare it to.  the shrimp was well seasoned and cooked just right.  It was a bit messy but that is expected.  The only complaint I have is that I wish they used a crustier type of bread instead of the hotdog bun type that was too crumbly.  I didn't eat a lot of the bread.  The highlight for me was the amazing mac and cheese for $4.50.  It was a side dish and it could've been an entree.  It was creamy and very well seasoned.  We all loved it.    Service was excellent.  The only issue I have is that the bathroom smelled a bit sewagey.  I understand this is probably not their fault as it is an old Wendy's building but maybe set up an air freshener in there.  It is a bit off putting.  They also need to put some effort towards their atmosphere a bit.  Change the lighting maybe from the fluorescent lighting and maybe add some music.  A touch of paint to just brighten the place up.  It'll make the place a bit more inviting.  A lot of people came by  for take out it seems and they have a new Sunday breakfast menu.  We will be back for the food."}
{"text":"Wow! What a treat. As a lifelong Southerner, and self proclaimed BBQ snob, this place is legit. Had the pulled pork and quarter chicken. No way to make it through the huge piles of food. The pork had great smokey flavor and an awesome caramelized bark. The chicken was seasoned perfectly and also had a great smoke put on it. The sauces are all good. Their own version of Kansas City sauces sweet to spicy. The mac and cheese is loaded with cheese and has a special hint of a seasoning. It might surprise you, but boy is it good. These people love their work, and it shows up in their food.  Staff is super friendly. Met with the cook and talked BBQ for a bit. Couldn't ask for more! Oh, and they have blues music playing. Just like \"home\"."}
{"text":"Not sure what the \"RD\" stands for but after eating what they served, it must mean \"Really Disastrous\"! Also, the \"Southern\" portion of the name MUST be referring to Southern Canada because there is NO WAY IN HELL this slop would pass as Southern BBQ in the Northern NY State, let alone in areas of the South.   Ordered \"Deans Bad Habit\" which was a pulled pork and brisket. Ordered a side of grilled vegetables and baked beans. I ordered the \"mild\" sauce on the meat. Holy crap - it was so hot. Like disgustingly hot. Like \"lick Satan's ass\" hot! The vegetables were \"grilled\" alright - they looked and tasted like they cooked them on the grill of a truck! The baked beans showed some signs of hope but alas, they tasted like they were marinated in an old shoe for a month.   Plus side to this dump? The \"Eric Clapton\" live album that played - would have enjoyed some actual \"Southern\" music but I'll take what I can get when facing any meal being served from this kitchen."}
{"text":"Our second time to RD's. First time their supplier didn't deliver their beef order. Staff recognized us too. Ordered 2 beef brisket platters  which is a misnomer as more like a plate. The brisket was okay, their bbq sauce was also okay. What I loved was their cole slaw. It was definitely on the expensive size. RD's location a bit out of the way for us, but with not many other BBQ places in Peel so will return."}
{"text":"I've had some incredible barbecue in dives in the southern states and even big chains, but despite giving RD's a try more than once, I just can't call them a good BBQ place despite the surprising amount of rave reviews.  The people there seem nice enough but I've had to wait for over 20 minutes on each of my two or three visits, even when calling in advance.  The food simply isn't good. Maybe I've had some bad luck there, but more than once??? The ribs were dried out and flavorless and slathered in BBQ sauce in an effort to make them taste like something - except the sauce wasn't good either. The fried foods were just greasy and disgusting.  Honestly, we made an effort to try and get through as much of the meal as we could just to not have felt to have thrown that money away. This all pains me to say because I love to support independent business. I'm glad so many people like it and wish them well, but I'll go to a Montana's location or Memphis BBQ in Woodbridge for my BBQ in the NW GTA."}
{"text":"Was in town last week on business, and was looking for something different in the area.  Took Yelps advice and checked our RD's.  Was not disappointed.  The beef tips were incredible.  So was the pulled pork.  The owner and staff were kind and friendly.  I'll definitely be back on my next trip to the Brampton area."}
{"text":"Ok i definitely had to update my review from the one previously written. As I had a huge craving for BBQ on a Tuesday afternoon, I just had to get my fix at RD's. Well unfortunately I was somewhat disappointed. I have to be completely honest, the ribs were wonderful in flavour. Very delicious, smoky and just good tasting BBQ. However the Mac & Cheese.... absolutely horrible! I feel terrible for having to even say this as usually the food is very good. But it was clear that I was give 2 of the smallest scoops of dried, tasteless left over Mac from the lunch rush ( I picked up my order at 3:30p). I couldn't even eat it and just threw it out- what a waste of $3.50! I have ordered RD's during the week in the late afternoons and I have to say there is clearly a marked difference between mid- week and Fri- Sun orders.  Even the food looks better on the weekends! Maybe the owners/ regular chefs only work the weekends? Who knows. All I do know is that management should be very careful to inspect and ensure that food quality and portion sizes are consistent at any point of the week. Especially as they're opening another location in Mississauga. Hopefully this was just a fluke and my next order will be back on track."}
{"text":"Definite a fan! Had dinner here with the family and the food was great. I had the big daddy sandwich which has chicken and shrimom. The chicken was very nicely done and the sauce that goes with it couldn't be better. Also had pulled pork and Wings."}
{"text":"I really feel lied to... such great reviews for such unappealing, dry, low quality meat. Spent $175 for a skip the dishes order... where they did not deliver the fries or 2lbs pulled pork, so I obviously can't review what was never delivered to us. What we did receive however was akin to trash. Ribs were a complete disappointment (Swiss Chalet Ribs are better). Seemed sauced and quickly broiled in the oven... GROSS. Same sadly goes for the wings. I enjoyed nothing about this meal... the coleslaw was oddly sour, the corn bread was out of a box, beans were unappetizing. Complete failure. I feel like I paid a lot in hopes of a great meal and was let down. I won't be reordering, as it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious and huge portions"}
{"text":"Who knew Brampton had such a great bbq place?  Not me, and I live here.  Found it in Yelp and decided to give it a try.  Got there fairly late so they were out of some stuff but settled on the bbq chicken sandwich, with a piece of cornbread on the side.  Could be the best chicken sandwich I've ever had.  Huge, tasty, fresh.  The cornbread was fluffy and crumbly, just as it should be.  I will def be back.  Only drawback is limited seating but they do takeout.  Really great."}
{"text":"This is the real deal for southern BBQ in Mississauga.  Location s little difficult to get at, tucked away in an industrial court but worth it.  I had half rack of ribs and big piece of corn bread along with a corona.  Good food and reasonable prices.  Soul and funk music in the. Soul and funk music in background  a plus. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Brampton. Food is amazing. Everyone talks about the brisket, but get the shrimp po boy. One of my favourites."}
{"text":"Went yesterday tried the pork brisket, seemed like it was cooked before and reheated. The french fries were low grade frozen! I also had the fried chicken it was okay - nice size pieces anyway. I would of preferred a bakers bun obviously and not reheated left over brisket. I hated the fries and wish someone said I could of had some other side as in beans or macncheese. I don't know who writes the other reviews but I know bang for buck and taste for quality. I hope to see some other credible review on here soon please. I may go back one day and try something with a better side then those terrible fries I had, but not in a rush to go out. I must say the food came with gravy on the side it was great. I think gravy with some Louisiana hot sauce in there. Anyways to my next lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Felt like I was back in New Orleans. Po Boys & Jerk wings and really good...wings are spicy. They ran out of ribs, will have to come back. Small place but steady stream of peeps coming in....A true hidden  gem"}
{"text":"This place is the friggin bomb.  We are very, very lucky to have a southern BBQ place here in Brampton finally.  And even though it's just a tiny take-out storefront, they make some great food and it's quite affordable too for a sandwich and a side.  Inside of the restaurant is very plain, mostly a take-out counter but the walls are decorated with big black & white jazz musician posters.  Their laptop is always out which means they must have wifi here.   It is traditional southern BBQ, which means one thing:  smoke!..  The baby back ribs, brisket, chicken (both BBQ and jerked), pulled pork, wings, are all smoked on-site before being finished with your choice of homemade BBQ or jerk sauce.  I have been here several times since they first opened just a few short weeks ago and everything has been great except for the french fries (which are frozen.)  The pulled pork has delicious bark and dry rub mixed into it, the brisket is tender and thinly sliced without being too fatty, and the ribs were great the one time I tried them.  Pics of all the food has been uploaded by me here on Yelp.   I just hope other people in the neighbourhood are going to support these guys, because everybody knows how hard it is for BBQ places to survive in the GTA.  So do yourself a favor if you like BBQ and check it out, you won't be disappointed.  The owners are super friendly and will remember their regulars.  Also if you're a fan of MMA or Boxing the guy will be more than happy to sit and chat with you for quite a while LOL   Worthwhile sides are definitely the homemade cornbread and their molasses baked beans (which pack a punch, spicy).  Mac & Cheese is nice too!   5/5, *especially* for Brampton standards.   And they even serve beer!"}
{"text":"I had to be in an out in less than an hour at dinner time.  They had quick, and very friendly service.  (Also a take out counter for future reference).  I can see this being a fun place to watch the game and have some food/drinks with friends as it's big and has a lot of room for groups.  It's very bright in there though.  lol  The food was really delicious.  I was surprised at the wide variety of unique options they had.   It wasn't your typical BBQ joint with just ribs, brisket, chicken.  I ended up getting their house special sandwich.  It was HUGE.  I got a side of mac and cheese too.  Needless to say, I had leftovers.  I loved the coleslaw as well.  Tasted homemade.    I'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"Haven't been back here since I moved downtown, but I remember it being the best damn southern BBQ in the 905. Their pulled pork will make your head spin!"}
{"text":"This is apparently the second location of this restaurant, which just opened about 6 months ago. From the outside, there was not much signage, and it looked kind of dark inside. I honestly may have thought it wasn't open if it weren't for the flashing \"open\" sign.  Granted, we were there late in the evening... It was also an American (not Canadian) holiday. When we arrived, there were no other diners, so perhaps this should have been a clue. On the inside, the decor doesn't do much to speak to the style of restaurant itself. The music was actually fun and fitting with the theme of the restaurant.   My husband grew up in the American Southeast, and I lived there for a while too. If we had not lived there, maybe our impressions of the food would have been different or slightly more forgiving anyway. We ordered the hush puppies, I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich, and my husband ordered a platter with a pound of pork and a quarter chicken. The quarter chicken and the corn bread were the only parts of the meal that was good. It was juicy, flavourful, and cooked well. The BBQ sauce was caramelized and the the skin was crunchy. The pork had hard chunks in it, and according to my husband \"didn't taste right.\" The cornbread used in the hush puppies was a lot sweeter than the regular cornbread. It was served with a garlic aioli, which is not a traditional preparation, but it was interesting.   And then there was the grilled chicken sandwich.... Rather than it being one nice chicken breast, it was several small slivers of chicken. The balsamic vinaigrette sauce on the chicken tasted good, but the sauce made the bun crumble, making the sandwich hard to eat. Also, I asked for cheese to be added to my sandwich, and for some reason, they used shredded cheese, which was inconsistently distributed across the sandwich. This caused the balance of flavours to be off. Also, the baked beans were a bit spicy while also lacking seasoning   (Either sweet or salty). After pouring what seemed like half a salt shaker out, the fries still seemed bland, and they were a bit cold, even when they first arrived.  On top of that, the waiter was one of the most surly Canadians I've ever met. Perhaps he was annoyed at having a final table come in. If they had wanted to close early, they should have just told us that and it would have saved us the anguish of eating there. My husband ordered both the chicken and pork mild, but the first time they came out, the chicken was mild and the pork was much spicier. When he reported to the server that he thought he'd gotten a spicier version and thought it was a mistake, the server initially denied it. Then he walked away and yelled to the kitchen to recook the pork. We had never been here before, and at that point we were still trying to gauge if the pork was really just that hot in its mild version should we return, so again we asked the server about whether or not it was a mistake. He eventually admitted that my husband may have been given the wrong thing, but no one seemed to care. The new pork was indeed milder, but my husband got very sick after the meal--- possible food poisoning?  The original location boasts many strong reviews, and we chose this one because it was closer to our house. Maybe we would have fared better there, but overall, the food was not terribly authentic, the flavours were poor, it was overpriced, and the service was terrible. Stay away if you've ever eaten good Southern BBQ!! We will not be back."}
{"text":"I have picked up from here several times. It's good food for a good price. Service is polite and efficient. The place is clean and organized. It's difficult to do this type of food and deliver it with consistent results but they have it right."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for a friend said it was a good spot for ribs. Service was sooooo slow. I think our food only arrived 45 mins later. The ribs were tough and dry. I have had better ribs at baton rough and Swiss chalet. Everything was so sweet. The coleslaw was sweet, the beans were doused with maple syrup. I think the only thing I thought was recommendable were the fries. Would not go back there. Service was bad too. No cutlery on the table, no wet napkins, and no one ever came to ask how we liked our food. Save your money and go somewhere else for food."}
{"text":"My second time going there during a week day. Good thing there wasn't a long line up.  1 st time there was a long line up but fortunately we had called in to make a reservation already. 1 st time the same menu we took were veryyyy delicious. It was 1 month ago. The chicken bbq was tender super juicy and flavor full. Same thing with the beef ribs bbq. Very good smoky flavor.   2 nd time wasn't so great. The chicken bbq was very dry. No taste almost. Once you eat the upper part of the chicken the inside just tasted like boiled chicken with no taste. The bbq ribs were ok. Had a good smokey bbq flavor to it. But wasn't as intense as the 1 st time I went. It was as if not enough left to be marinated that the flavor didn't get inside the meat ribs. Only the top part was good to eat as the bbq sauce was on top. They leave u with a game on the table to play while waiting for your meal. Not all tables has it though.  Overall I like it. The bbq flavor was great. I will try it again another time and see what happens. I like consistency."}
{"text":"It's not terrible but not one of the best BBQ I've had. Very slow service, at least at lunch and this is my first time here. Took an hour to get food."}
{"text":"Literally the best customer service ever. I feel so guilty that I forgot to give the old lady a tip. I definitely will go back and give her triple the tip next time. She's awesome and so is the food!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times in the past 3 weeks already. You have to try their beef brisket. It's literally perfect! Either getting the brisket itself or their brisket sandwich."}
{"text":"I came for a UYE in a cold, cold evening.    \"How does the chef learn to cook like this?\"  I thought.  \"It tastes really like, I don't know, good Southern food that I can eat in the States.\"  I ordered 1/4 rib and pulled pork with medium sauce ($12.50).  Holy yum yum! They tasted rich.  The sauce was very thick and smoky.  It reminded me of Bull Eye Original BBQ sauce but thicker.  The ribs were slow smoked to tenderness.  There was not much fatty issue on the ribs, yet the meat was still moist, just not so soft and juicy that the meat fell off the bones, but it was still very easy to rip.  The pulled pork was just sensational.  The meat was from good part.  It was cooked to soft yet still had a rich meat taste.  The medium sauce was made for this pulled pork.  The flavour sipped through the fibra and saturated the finely pulled pork.  It was finger licking good, I tell ya.    The decor of RD is simple.  It is a hole in the wall.  It is maybe 5 steps from rundown, but I don't know if the style is intentional or not.  I like the jazz posters on the wall, and the jazz music in the background.    The people were great, too.  We met the chef, you know the guy on the front page of RD's website.  He was so laid back and friendly.  With him, and the music, and the BBQ meat, I wondered where my glass of rum was.  [Sigh] Good times indeed."}
{"text":"We walked in, and a waft of smokiness just filled the air. We knew we were going to eat some good bbq.   Like everyone mentioned, it's a hole in the wall.There were a few tables to set up maybe seats around 20 or so people?   There were so many choices on the menu - it took us awhile to decide, but the server was patient.   We decided on some ribs and a pound of mild wings and a side of sweet potato fries. The ribs were delicious! The ribs were tender, but not too tender - it had a good bite to it and were so meaty and it was so saucy. The wings were also in the same sauce as the ribs. There was a nice tang to the sauce, and not overly sweet and they were perfectly cooked. The size of the wings were pretty decent - I think we got 9 wings in the 1lb. All the meats were cooked to perfection! The sweet potato fries weren't fresh cut - but crisp and hot to the table- so good! The server also brought us a small sample portion of the coleslaw! Creamy slaw -went perfectly with our meal. The bill came up to about $27 including drinks. Which is pretty decent since we were fully satisfied!   The service was quick and everyone who worked there was so friendly, and lovely! The owner turned down the tv and put on some quiet music in the background instead when he saw that my friend and I were having a chat, which was so considerate. I'm already looking forward to my return there to try the other items on the menu. I think I'll be finding more reasons to visit Brampton in the near future.  A word of advice, you WILL smell like Barbeque and smoke when you leave here- and it will be a constant reminder of how good the food at RD's is."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place InBrampton that had some decent wings, when i came across the Yelp review for RD's.  I thought... Wow, 100 reviews and a 4.5 start rating that's pretty good.  Pictures of pulled pork, beef brisket and others made my mouth salivate...i told my girlfriend this is where we were going for dinner.    She had a po boy catfish sandwich, which was surprisingly light and very flavorful.  I had a half pulled pork, half beef Brisket sandwich which was worth the drive to Brampton alone.  The Mac and cheese as well as the coleslaw was also delicious... And i was blown by the size of cornbread given.  Prices are extremely reasonable, and staff were extremely polite.  It showed that they took pride in their business and believed in how good their product is.   I'll have to try the Mississauga location for specific food items only sold there."}
{"text":"Been hearing about this place for awhile so I decided to stop in today and man am I happy I did. I ordered half rack of ribs with 2lb wings, shrimp po boy sandwich, cat fish sandwich and their Mac and cheese. Everything was fresh and delicioso!!! Their ribs are the best I've ever tasted. I usually will never eat mac and cheese but theirs is really nice!!!. The people that work their are very friendly as well which is nice and a bonus. Will definitely BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"I use to frequent this location when it was In Brampton. It's the best BBQ spot closest to my home.  It was my first time at their new location in Mississauga. Place looks nice with a lot of seating. There old location was very cramped and you literally had to be lucky to find a spot amongst their limited seating.  My hubby and I were in the mood to go all out yesterday so we order a Catfish Po boy sandwich, Big Daddy Burger, Whole rack of ribs with 1lb wings combo, 2 orders of Mac and cheese, coleslaw and Corn bread.  Let me first say,, the big daddy burger will change your life... very tasty and very filling.. if your not into spice you definitely want to get the meat in mild because when they asked me what I preferred I thought it was By canadian standards.. so I chose the medium selection, it was hot but I still tore it up..  Ribs were good so were the wings.. mac and cheese was nothing special and a little under seasoned for my taste.. I feel like they could of jazzed it up a bit.. coleslaw and cornbread were delicious...  I would return but their prices are a little steep for me. My total was a whopping $93... I would come back every once and while.. I feel like this place is lucky that they don't have much competition out west..   Definitely a must try... you will love it!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the reasons that I love Yelp..You hear about hidden gems through reviews and they happen to be right in your neighborhood.  I finally decided to head on down the infamous RD Southern BBQ on Kennedy and Queen.  I almost passed by it as it was in a small strip mall north of Queen St.  Parking can be a little hard because of some limited spaces in the mall.  I was greeted by the father and son team who runs and owns the restaurant.  I opted for \"Dean's Bad Habit\"...Pulled pork and Beef Brisket on a kaiser with BBQ sauce....Plain and Simple..I also had a side of cornbread (which I am sucker for).  The seating is seat yourself and  they bring it to the table.  The sandwich is freaking huge!!! It was like a pound of BBQ goodness and homemade bbq sauce.  He also gave me a side of coleslaw and hot sauce to try out as well.  The sandwich was succulent and very tasty, not to mention eating a sandwich that was as big as my head.  For the first time ever..I ate the coleslaw...I hate coleslaw..I've always disliked it...but RD's coleslaw I would order that in a second..it hit all the right notes for me.   They also do a special on Fridays of Cajun cooking and it is served till its gone (Ettoufee and Jambalaya).  The staff and the owners are awesome and the food is just as good.  If your looking for a BBQ experience that will remember...just think of RD's Southern BBQ in Brampton.."}
{"text":"Whoever said that they had decent portion sizes must eat like a bird. I had 1/2 rack of ribs with apparently 1/2 LB of wings (4 very small wings). I opted for no fries and asked for double coleslaw. The double serving amounted to 1/4 cup. Mine was $23 and I'm still hungry.   Service is slow. But the ribs were nearly as good as I've had in some of the southern US.  Forget the 4 wings for $8. Coleslaw was ok. My wife's salad with mango dressing was good apparently.   So if you have lots of time and are patient and want decent ribs, this is a good place for that.   Nearly an hour start to finish."}
{"text":"tip: inaccessible from hurontario st  carved into the remains of a wendy's carcass is this surprise of a bbq joint.  once you step foot in here, your nostrils are greeted with the heavenly aromas of bbq smoked meat.  the decor is extremely modest, and maybe even too bare.  but, food is, and should always be, the most important aspect of a restaurant, and rd's has made it clear that that's what they care about - a short chat with the friendly waitress reveals that rd's prides themselves on good ol' homemade southern bbq.  their menu is phenomenal - aside from the classic bbq meat items (brisket, ribs, pulled pork, etc.), there are a number of american southern classics, such as blackened catfish, gumbo, etoufee, and jambalaya.  our party opted to share the half pound of brisket and the blackened catfish.  i'd have liked the brisket to be served a little bit hotter than how we got it, but it more than made up for that by being tender and completely delicious.  i was impressed with how the smoke taste fought through the prominent bbq sauce flavour to still be noticeable.  the fries were out-of-this-world good too - thick, crispy exterior, and mushy interior.  in a place with such little decor, it was quite the surprise to see the blackened catfish plated somewhat elegantly (see picture).  a flavourful dish loaded with black pepper, as it should be.  the portion of the fish was just right, and it was cooked perfectly.  mashed potatoes and tangy black peppery sauce complemented the fish very well.  overall, a very enjoyable visit with stellar food and friendly waitstaff.  you may have to wait a bit for your food (15-20m), but it's 500% worth it  tl;dr: go eat here"}
{"text":"Looks are deceiving with this place. It's a small, hole in the wall restaurant with awesome food!  There are a few tables for eating in (about 6 or so) but I'm sure most of their business is takeout as it doesn't seem to be designed for diners as a primary. That aside, let's get to the most important part - the food!! DELICIOUS!  -pulled pork (mild): delish! Nice & saucy, good hint of smoke -mac n' cheese: great mix of spices & cheese - interesting twist on this side!!  -pork ribs: saucy & good smokiness -cornbread: a bit bland, wont order it again  Good value/portion for the price!!   Good selection of items & even some authentic southern foods like fried okra, jambalaya, gumbo, etc... wouldnt mind  trying next time!  Service was fairly quick. The dining tables were full & others ahead of us for takeout. Lady at the counter was pleasant & helpful. I know some other reviewers had mentioned the owner/chef is usually serving & is a great host so maybe can meet him next time....he was very busy in the kitchen on the evening we went:-)  Wasn't a fan of the smokiness within the place (kitchen is right out front near customer seating)....not very tolerant of smoke so was getting a headache just waiting for my takeout.   They also do a booth at Brampton rib fest so can always check them out there in the summer!! They serve beef ribs there that they don't usually have in the restaurant (if u prefer beef ribs)"}
{"text":"Rds is a great place of you ate looking for some smoked meat or an amazing sandwich. The big daddy sandwich is a must try! Deep fried Shrimp with grilled chicken and a house sauce. Rds makes even a simple salad taste good. Friendly staff and excellent fresh food!"}
{"text":"I am very annoyed with this restaurant. I ordered via uber eats and they substituted fries for mash potatoes. I hate fries. The fried chicken was okay but my whole meal was a disaster. Uber only credited me back for the fries. I'm left half hungry and that was the only resolution. I am not impressed. It's pretty bad when a restaurant just automatically decides to send you what they want. I would suggest not getting delivery from here. Also took extra long. Posted 30 mins took almost an hour ."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good bbq place in toronto but here's a pretty decent place for ribs, the beef brisket was kind of chewy but still tasted alright....decently priced and generous portions, comes with a side of coleslaw for $12 (1/4 ribs and beef brisket)  Limited dining and probably better to take out from here Also got the Mac n cheese which was very good, very cheesy and quite heavy"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here and it was amazing. I ordered the Hush puppies (deep fried corn bread), mac and cheese, and a pulled sandwich. Highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd location for RD's BBQ. We were there for the \"Grand Opening\" & the food was mediocre. We thought it was a one-off mistake. But alas...it was not. Tonight's dinner was not good. They were actually out of Fries. Waiter said we could substitute any of the other sides & then charged us an EXTRA dollar for the sweet potato fries!!! The food was cold & the Po-Boy was bland & the service was not good! Sorry to say this but, we're not going back. Disappointed! :("}
{"text":"Is a tiny but with a great food !!!! Ribs are delicious !!!!! Wings are so so delicious I want to buy more !!!! Coleslaw was good !!!!! Customer service was great !!!!!!they need more variety of local beers !!!! Location was 5 minutes from best western plus !!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Excited to see their new location. Great authentic BBQ. Definitely try it out- even my super picky boyfriend loves it!"}
{"text":"Have been there many times, (Mississauga location). It used to be great, loved the shrimp poboy. Recently the quality has not been great. The quantity of the shrimp is much less and the bread is always stale and not toasted. Unless they improve on quality and quantity, we will not be going back there."}
{"text":"BBQ in the middle of Winter?  Why the hell not, I said, as I participated in a UYE organised by Ryan F., driving out to Brampton on one of the coldest nights!  Actually, it was the best.decision.ever. as the food at RD's made me believe, albeit briefly, that it was Summer!!!  I've had RD's bookmarked for the longest time, but never found a reason to be in this area.  So glad I ventured out 'cause I finally had a chance to experience what all the amazing reviews were all about.  The \"Skinny\" (ha ha!) - Since we went as a group, I was able to taste a bit of everything, including some Hush Puppies (corn fritter apps), Creole Rice (yum!), Cole Slaw (it was a side for my Shrimp PoBoy), Bake Beans, Mac & Cheese, Mammoth Poutine (oh my lord, mammoth is no exaggeration!), Catfish PoBoy, Pulled Pork, & Beef Brisket.  (I think the only thing that was on the table that I didn't sample were the Ribs + Big Daddy.  I'll save that for my next visit!)  Everything was delicious!  And although I liked my Shrimp PoBoy, I'd say that RD's standout is DEFINITELY the BBQ, re:  ribs (probably, but I never tried), brisket, & pulled pork.  So if you're a first-timer, I'd go with the BBQ meats!  Owners were down-to-earth, very friendly, patient, and knowledgeable about their food.  You could tell - & it shows too - that it is their passion and I love going to places like this!  While we were there, owners told us that they are opening another location within the next few months in the Hurontario/Derry area, so great news for people like me who live in 'ssauga!"}
{"text":"I don't know why so many people like this place. Maybe they've never had real BBQ, I don't know. I just think you can do so much better than this place. When I went here, I ordered a lot because everyone in my group wanted to share to try a little bit of everything. And honestly, I didn't like one single thing. I thought the food here was so gross. But it was the SERVICE that was even worse than the food. It was honestly so awkward. The waitress came back to ask how we were doing, and then I guess she didn't have anything else to do, so she just hung around our table and watched us. All of us felt like she was fully STARING at us, and all of us felt creeped out. The terrible food and the awkward service make this place the absolute worst restaurant that I've ever been to. I will never be returning."}
{"text":"After the rave reviews, maybe my expectations fewer too high, but the BBQ here was nothing like the real BBQ I had in Nashville. There wasn't enough of a crust on the meat and it wasn't that tender (I had ribs and beef brisket). Terrible, tasteless mac and cheese. None of the cheesy gooeyness you'd expect. Great BBQ sauce though!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried out RD's for the first time tonight. Tried the ribs and wings, it came with fries and coleslaw. We also got a side of their mac and cheese, and it was super tasty.  Everything was great. We were not disappointed. Can't wait to go back and try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Finding this place was a great surprise. As expressed in these reviews the food is terrific so it was no shock that I loved my Shrimp PoBoy.  What WAS a surprise though was the terrific level of service. The strip mall it's in is ugly, dirty, and in a crummy neighborhood. Basically they have every excuse to rely on the quality of their food alone.   Yet the young man behind the counter may as well have been working in a trendy downtown eatery.  This place deserves a better location!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love giving five stars when they are deserved. And in case of RD's BBQ, they are totally deserved.  John - owner (and also chef and waiter and a guy at the counter) of the place is literally giving his life to what he's doing. And results are shining.  Talking about the food quality - it's delicious. And I am not throwing this sort of compliments easily. We tried different plates and all of them were leaving us with a happy smile. Portions are enormous for the price, and price is right!  The place itself is tiny and almost lost between other small businesses in the block, but it is clean and cared about - again, you can tell the work of love.  RD's Southern BBQ is not about money, it's about human heart. I am so glad to discover this little place, and would be happy to be back again and again.  Recommended without any doubts."}
{"text":"The food is so bomb! Everything is made fresh to order so naturally it's worth the wait. Big daddy is highly recommended for the hungry Man  Mac n cheese is on point Ribs are bomb Good corn bread And the pulled pork poutine is something else"}
{"text":"While looking for something quick in Brampton, I was prompted to RD by Yelp as they had very good reviews of the place.  I went by to get some take out to try.  I order the beef brisket, mac & cheese and 1/2 chicken with the total coming to $29 which is a good price in my opinion.  The beef brisket was well flavoured but was a bit dry... The chicken was absolutely amazing!  It was moist and so full of flavour.  There sauce complimented it very well...   I will definitely be back to get the chicken again and try other items on the menu... It also helps that the owners are really cool people and made me feel welcomed in their shop..."}
{"text":"Wow. What a gem. I'll start off by saying I've had some pretty damn good ribs before,  traveling down south. The real south and R&D's knows BBQ.   The ribs are fall off the bone with your choice of mild/med/hot smothered sauce.   Wings were huge and cooked perfectly.   Coleslaw was also great.   The only thing lacking was our Mac and cheese. Wasn't bad but forgetful.   They ran out of the shrimp sandwich which left me wanting more but it'll be an excuse to come visit them again soon.    The owners are all family members and very welcoming. I felt like I was eating at my friends house.  This is very rare and I loved it.   It's a very small shop but I think they're more about quality over quantity.   This will be my go to BBQ spot from now on. No more over priced, lackluster rib fest for me.  Delicious food, great prices and family type service. Seriously what more can you ask for??  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"3 of us dined on a full rack of ribs and an order of pulled pork. We went a bit crazy with sides - they have great mac & cheese and the beans are very good as well. Solid cole slaw and fries.  It's a casual eatery and we really like the food. They also do take out and you can order from a service like uber eats for delivery.  This location is much larger than their old one was in Brampton."}
{"text":"Great bbq spot. Have had ribs poutine and  pulled pork burger and all tasted fresh and great. Went in on a Saturday during the day the service was slightly slow with a empty restaurant but it was well worth the wait and atleast lets me know the food is cooked well. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"I loved this place! Good reviews (thanks to my fellow Yelpers) and been meaning to try it out for sometime now. They seem to be closed every time I'm in the area. Well, the stars aligned and it was worth the wait!   Got the ribs and fish burger. Yummy! The ribs were juicy, and heavenly. And the fish burger was amazing as well. Good portion. Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Very good fried chicken, it takes 25 minutes to make..very fresh. I suggest the hush puppies for appetizers and the ice tea is tangy but good"}
{"text":"Went today for an early dinner. Started with drinks my mojito was really good, perfectly made so great job to the server she did an excellent job with the service. The food was good the Cajun wings are a little spicy, but very tasty nonetheless. The Mac & cheese wasn't good to me but everything else was!  Will go back"}
{"text":"They paved paradise and put up a BBQ restaurant.  However, the entrance was nondescript which matched the freshly paved parking lot and sign-less building. We did notice a banner of sorts on the main road. The medium brown bricks reminded me of an old Wendy's exterior.   There was not even BBQ smoke wafting outside. Many things that would have you going hmm normally, yet my good old friend had tried RD's original location in Brampton and he knows how to eat. Therefore, if it was worth it for him, then it was worthy of me and therefore us.  The dining area was semi-austere, again looking a little Wendy's circa late 80's, but with Jazz music playing.  Their liquor license was clearly pending (at that time) and one group left apparently because of that (was a Monday night, so perhaps they were looking for a little hair-of-the-weekend).  We ordered soft drinks $3 and they came out just before the 4 house sauces, mild, medium, 'Canadian' hot and 'Southern' Hot (which of these kids is doing there own thing, bright red whilst the other 3 were a shade of deep maroon).  I noticed an interior sign saying desserts by Robi D. (new) was a bit confusing as I thought the place was named after her...R.D's (turned out not).  The menu did stand up to the Deep South theme having several signature New Orleans dishes i.e. Jambalaya and Étouffée. We would be having none of the seafood this time.  We would be having, what turned to be a great value play: the Dean Bad sandwich; combining both sliced brisket and saucy pulled pork on a giant bun for $13, served with skin on fries (not bad, not great), semi cream coleslaw and the \"grr\" giant bone in beef ribs (more like a club with meat attached) with excellent bark.  Our server was on the ball, bringing soda refills to keep us occupied while we waited a little bit for our food order.  When the food did arrive, it was clear what was not hmm, about RD's BBQ - the TASTE and PORTIONS of their meat.  We dealt with our plates, and how to manage sharing the sandwich in a non-barbarian like way. Much gnawing and chewing was witnessed across the table and so it was time for dessert. We had strategically decide to take leftovers for a late night snack and saved some need stomach space.  All desserts clocked in at $4 flat. At the finish line of our meal we each chose one. I the peach cobbler (they say Southern BBQ, so let's see). He the Green Gator (supposedly Key Lime flavour Cheesecake - interesting enough).   In reality they both came custard cups, and were underwhelming. The cobbler was not a crumble, but like a lukewarm pie dough with I will say nicely compoted peaches, literally two bites of each and they were gone. Worst of all the Key lime dessert had no Key Lime flavour or really flavour at all. Was also neither hot or cold and for all intents and purposes a meal ender literally.  In sum, they just opened, got it. The meat is mammoth, the sauce is heartburn inducing, the coleslaw was fine and dandy yet too small to balance the onslaught of meat, and saucy beans. Still that sandwich and double beef rib were 5 star. Skewing that, the rating shall remain 4 stars. Workout the opening kinks and we'll just say, \"Something's cooking\"."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great customer service the staff was super informative. Food made with some serious love. I had the beef brisket, dirty rice and coleslaw. The coleslaw was creamy and flavourful so good! The beef brisket was tender and juicy with some bomb BBQ sauce and the rice was a perfect accompaniment. My only complaint is I'd like a bigger portion."}
{"text":"Very friendly service - felt very welcome! And the ribs were amazing! Very saucy! We highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!!! I absolutely loooove this place.  Couple of my friends were hungry so we were just looking for places to eat and since this place received great reviews we thought we'd try it.  Truthfully, I wasn't expecting much of this place but the food and service just blew me away.  I've had southern food before but it was always downtown Toronto, but boy am I glad they have one closer to home.  My boyfriend and I ordered the Mac n Cheese (you have to try it, it's delicious!!), southern fried chicken, and a half rack of ribs with dirty rice on the side and they were all amazing! The flavour was all there and more!  The service was great, she was super nice and helpful.  The chef even came out to greet us and ask how are food was.  The restaurant is very family friendly with large booths and tables.  I will definitely be returning, the food was awesome, and the service was great."}
{"text":"This place is amazing its a must try. Chicken and ribs :) BBQ places are hit and miss this one was great and they had baked beans which is always good."}
{"text":"Okay so let me take you through this...  You walk in and it smells like the smoker. There are two men behind the counter and a beautiful voice rings through the speakers. It is Billie Holiday and you feel like you crossed the Mason-Dixon line.   There are people patiently waiting in chairs at the front of the restaurant, and the two kind men behind the counter direct you to take a menu (simple card stock with bright colours and very fair prices) and sit down in a small eating area in the back of the restaurant.   I waited... for a while... and got mildly irritated but then I figured out this is just how it is done here, low and slow, and the pace set me at ease.  We picked out our food (a Dean's Bad Habit: Pulled Pork, Beef Brisket on a fresh roll with medium BBQ sauce smothered all over it, a dish of Macaroni and Cheese: by far the best I have ever eaten, sorry mom, and a monkey dish of runny creamy coleslaw).   The music plays in the background and now it is Thelonious Monk, and I remember what he said \"Sometimes it's to your advantage for people to think you're crazy\". This is exactly how I feel because I would have never gone away from the chain restaurants if it weren't for my new career which forces me to eat out almost 15 times a week.   The food comes, and I pick up my fork. It is neatly and simply wrapped with a knife in a paper napkin. I try to dig into my food but I am reminded by my fellow Yelper we need to take pictures of the food first. I can't wait and take a small bite of the macaroni. This is when it happened, I fell in love. The noodles were slightly al dente in places and the cheese was thick and hanging on to the noodles like that cat in the picture saying \"hang in there\". There are all sorts of flavours bursting out here none of which I can isolate, but everyone of them makes me think I am going to be greeted by a fine southern gentleman asking if \"everything is to your liking\".   I decided to try the coleslaw next, and it has a creamy flavour that is as I said slightly runny and just the right temperature, not too cold, and very refreshing.   Then it is time to take on the massive pile of meat and bun that is sitting in front of me. I pick it up and it is legitimately heavy. I hold on with two hands and move my mouth toward the savoury goodness. I don't remember what happened next but everyone around me in the restaurant was looking at me and one of the two men behind the counter was bringing me napkins and asking to take my picture so he could show everyone on Instagram \"that RD face\".   When I came to again the plate was full of drippings and there was nothing left but the flavour of a juicy porcine/bovine encounter.   I guess you could say it was as close as I will get to being in Nirvana.    First time Yelper, Thank you for this community.    Andrew"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly. The food was quick and it tasted fresh. The barbecue sauce was really good as I had the pulled pork.  Comes with a tasty side of coleslaw and I ordered some creole rice which was flavourful. I look forward to going back and trying something different."}
{"text":"First time here.. I just literally left and took the rest home. I got the macoroni and cheese, BBQ chicken wings with jerk sauce on the side and the Po' Bo sandwich (Fried Cat Fish Sandwich) and corn bread. It was Delicious!! The mac and cheese was decent 3 or 4 out of 5. Pobo sandwich 5 out of 5 and the corn bread was decent 3 out of 5. I would definitely come here again. I ate in and the lady serving me gave great customer service and recommended the Pobo Sandwich to me. It was my first time trying cat fish and I was skeptical, but thank Goodness I did. I enjoyed it, and would order it again and again. Yum!  I recommend."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good. Since the new location opened there is nothing good about it. Over done beef ribs (severely over done) same with the regular ribs. The overall quality has decreased substantially. My wife literally got sick from the food last night. What a waste. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love authentic southern bbq food, especially after my experience trying Smoque n' Bones in Toronto. However, the idea of checking this place out never shout out to me. One day for curiosity sake I browsed their menu online and saw that they had a great menu with lots of options. Also, when I saw that they serve corn bread I was determined to go, since corn bread is my weakness. We entered in and to my surprise it wasn't completely empty, but rather a few tables were occupied. For some reason I expected this place to barely have anyone. Anyways, we were seated immediately, but I realized that their menu was extremely minimal compared to the one I saw online. No collard greens, no extensive list of authentic southern desserts, and no corn bread!! Regardless, I ordered the bbq chicken and asked if I could sub the fries for the baked beans, which they agreed to do without any hesitation. The server was in a grumpy mood. Whether this was a regular thing, I don't know. I also ordered a side salad with dressing on the side. My friend got the Preacher burger. The food was served within 10 minutes and looked great with a generous serving size. They did forget to put the dressing on the side for my salad, but the server gladly replaced it once I pointed it out. My chicken and beans were amazing, especially the bbq sauce on it. I literally licked my plate clean by the end. My friend really enjoyed his gluttonous burger, but couldn't manage to finish it, despite having a huge appetite, which says a lot about the burger size.  Prices were reasonable. Also, this seems to be the only authentic southern bbq place nearby.  I would gladly return when the cravings hit."}
{"text":"Wow. Great food & great service. Recommended to me after my friend visited a few days ago with nothing but good things to say. The owner RD came by us after our meal to make sure we enjoyed ourselves. Cornbread could've been a bit better, only thing keeping me from giving 5 . Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious - authentic, flavourful, can't stop stuffing your face southern BBQ.  I was in a group of 6 and we got the family combo which included 2lbs of pulled pork, 2 lbs of wings, 3 racks of ribs and all the sides you'd want.  It was a great value!  We also got a side of the mac and cheese which did not disappoint.  On top of the great food - the service is great.  The owner was super friendly and warm and the servers were very accommodating.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. The service is superb! They blew me away with how friendly and helpful they all are. And not to mention the food. The food! My goodness, it's delicious. I had the beef brisket sandwich with a side of mac n cheese, along with spoonfuls of my sister's Friday night special, the gumbo.  While, I am no brisket connoisseur, the meat was soooo tender. I felt like Guy Fieri, making a commotion over how it melted in my mouth. The gumbo was also excellent, packed with flavour and perfectly cooked.  I will for sure be coming back. They rotate Friday night specials every week, and I got my eye on that jambalaya!"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?  Their ribs or pulled pork. Lathered in their special Southern barbecue sauce, their meats are smoked in the smoker till it's cooked. Ordered a full rack of ribs to share, we couldn't finish! We had ordered the full rack of ribs set dinner so it included a half chicken. It cost $36 but the rack was huge. When we went at 6 pm, it was relatively quiet on a weekday. I guess not a lot of ppl know of its existence here!! We also ordered hush puppies and a macaroni and cheese dish. Hush puppies were deep fried corn bread. It was interesting because I never tried fried cornbread. Usually it's just baked corn bread. The mac and cheese was really cheesy and oozing with flavour when you put it in your mouth. I liked the decor and the music they were playing - really makes you feel like you're in a restaurant specializing in southern cuisine. The only thing to note is the meat can be rather dry. I guess because meat is smoked to cook it through, this makes the meat more dry? Their hot sauce option for the meat isn't too hot so if you wanted a kick from the hot sauce, you'll need to ask for extra peppers on the side if they have any. For me, the hot sauce is just right because I can't eat too spicy. The amount of food we ordered was more than enough for a dinner though.   LAST TIP?   I wouldn't order the hush puppies because it wasn't anything special but remember to try their smoked meat in their special BBQ sauce. They have different lunch specials for 8.50 everyday so you can take advantage of that. They also have set dinners for up to 4 ppl too and a frozen version of their BBQ'ed meats to take home too!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place and I'm glad I got recommended to. The moment you walk into the restaurant, you'll smell a strong BBQ smell  we came on a Friday night for dinner and it wasn't too too busy yet - it started getting a bit busier by 8pm. We had a huge group of 11 people and it took us quite a while to receive our food. I was told by a friend who has been here before that it takes a bit to get your food because majority of the stuff are slow cooked; which is understandable. Maybe it's because we had a larger group? Seems like 2 orders were forgotten which was a huge downside to eating here. Apart from that, portions were rather large and food was great! I would come here again when I'm craving some pulled pork poutine!   Waitresses/waiters come often to check up on us and refills water.  Seating size is average, looks like they can house under 40 people ish.  They are able to split bills and cash/credit are accepted."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner.  The service was efficient and friendly.  Food-wise, the mac n cheese was solid. Not the best I've had but still good. The cajun chicken wings were OK - nothing special. The pork ribs were tender and the sauce (medium) had a slight bit of kick and was good but not good enough for me to go back.  Reasonably priced though."}
{"text":"Great little place to fix your need for some Bar-B-Q. Their sides fit very well with the mains, (the ones we could try) they were out of beans and a few other staples.  Service was slower than expected but they apologized several times to make us feel it wasn't the norm. The brisket was delicious and the ribs were cooked to perfection. I would have enjoyed having some extra sauce for our meal but because we took our meal to go that wasn't an option. We will certainly return and give them another try in the future."}
{"text":"An initial rough start at open seems to be fully resolved and now the food is back to the high standard I expected from the Kennedy location. Lots of family favourites here: ribs, the amazing sandwiches and po boys, great fries, beans *drool* seriously this place will fat you up. Can't wait for their breakfast."}
{"text":"Cornbread is literally my favourite thing to eat and these people did it so wrong Too Oily, no taste, very bland  Hope the rest of their menu is better..."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Brampton, look of the place doesn't do justice to the food and the service they offer but I do takeout so I don't care :-)"}
{"text":"I should of updated this earlier but the last time I went for the pulled pork sandwich they serve it on the Italian buns you get from the local grocery store which are smaller and it doesn't come with the slaw. Not impressed. The prices have also been adjusted.  I will give it 4 stars because I can't give a 3.5 &  because it is about time a place like this came to the area and the food is still very good."}
{"text":"I hate to be the odd one with my rating, but maybe because of all the excellent reviews I read I was expecting better BBQ. Don't get me wrong, it was good and should definitely be recognized for its excellent service, homemade BBQ, and the most moist cornbread I've ever had. But I just wasn't blown away.  We ordered the pound of beef brisket ($12) to share, plus a side of beans and cornbread. Along with what we ordered, they gave us two buns and a small coleslaw to try. The beef wasn't as tender as I expected, the sauce took some getting used to for me because it was more of a dense, dull fired flavor, but I did like it. Not a lot of flavor in the beans, the cornbread was moist but was much better with honey, and the coleslaw was creamy, crunchy, and full of flavor.   I love the family owned atmosphere with free wifi, plenty of seating, and best of all very friendly employes who are eager to make sure you enjoy your experience...which you will!"}
{"text":"Walked in here for a quick lunch and to try the brisket sandwich  This place has potential  I think it is their second store at Highway 10 and Derry  The old Wendy's   Store looks very bland almost dirty -- filthy busing trolley sitting in the middle of the tables full of soiled dishes. Very unappetizing   Staff were very bland. Not even one smile to anyone while I was there   But they seemed efficient   brisket sandwich was OK.  VERY DRY AND COLD INSIDE.  TOUGH AND SMOTHERED ON A HEAVY TOMATO BASRD SAUCE   GOOD SIZED PORTION BUT A BIT EXPENSIVE AT $10   There seems to be no love put into the food service or the restaurant so I don't think that it can flourish PITY !!!   Don't think I would return ....  PITY !!"}
