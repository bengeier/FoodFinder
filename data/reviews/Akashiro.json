{"text":"After informing the waitress of my time restriction it took her 15 minutes to even come to the table and take our order. The ramen I had was beyond gross. The noodles were extremely overcooked, the meat had no taste and the broth was disgustingly bland and flavorless. I've had the sushi here before and it was ok, but this experience has given me reason to never go back.

I eat a lot of ramen and this was by far the worst I've ever had. I left 95% of the bowl untouched and still paid for it. Never again..."}
{"text":"To-go sushi was at average price, however rice was hardened and you can tell it was old. After eating all 7 pieces, I discovered a hair on the last piece... YUCK! ALL EMPLOYEES HANDLING FOOD SHOULD WEAR A HAIR NET!"}
{"text":"Service was bad. Took them 20 minutes to take my order. Food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Not the worse sushi joint I've been at, but it certainly charges more for the slightly better than food court-quality rolls. The calamari looked a lot like onion rings, but the squid was tender and the dipping sauces were good compliments -- very strange though that the calamari was served over a bed of lettuce and potato crisps.

The spicy tuna rolls were mediocre and the sushi sashimi set was an interesting mix of fish, although it could have been fresher. The server was very polite and quick to refill our glasses of water...considering the intimate atmosphere, it's a great place for conversation as long as you're not picky about your sushi."}
{"text":"Went to this place today with my wife around 6.20 pm and ordered our food in 5 mins.... After 30 minutes of waiting, I asked one of the waitresses how our order was and she said she saw that coming. Another 5 mins later, another waitress come and asked if we have ordered our food and we finally realized our order never go to their system. During the period, I've seen 3 or 4 couples left without anything on their table. This is absolutely the worst restaurant and service I've seen"}
{"text":"made a mistake of coming here for lunch!! service was not so bad....but the food? it should be served in the fast food area of the mall."}
{"text":"Party of two ordered the salmon lovers and veggie rolls with two miso soup bowls.

The restaurant was empty during the busy lunch hours at the food court but we still wanted to go for sushi and that was the only choice we had. 

We got our miso soup and it had an irregular smell. Then the main order comes in and the salmon lovers was full of skin and felt old and chewy to the point that I couldn't eat half the plate. We called the waitress and complained that we have been to many Japanese restaurants but none offered salmon as such for sushi . The reason obviously could be to the fact the fish turnover at that place is extremely low. 

At the end nothing was done from the restaurant side for the food or the bill. We left and wanted to make sure no one has such an experience. Avoid at all costs unless you want to pay for bad food."}
{"text":"Oh boy. Why do they even bother with the yuppie atmosphere? This place sucks. I ordered bibimbap, which is stupid easy to make. It cost 6 dollars more than good bibimbap I've had at little holes in the wall in Chinatown. I got a bowl of rice with a bunch of lettuce and an egg on top. Hot sauce wasn't hot, lettuce wasn't even crisp and was unpleasantly hot on the edges. I am waiting for the bill as we speak and am probably going to cry as I shell out 15 dollars for this wad of misery."}

{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars, because this place doesn't even deserve 1 star.
I came here for dinner with my parents before a show at Massey Hall. 
The people I was with ordered some appetizers and a few sushi rolls, and I ordered the chef's menu. We told our waitress we had to be at a show in an hour and and a quarter, and she said no problem, she'd make sure the food was out quick. 

Our drinks came quick, then, after 15 mins, our miso soup came. It was way too salty. Then we sat and waited for the rest of our food. By the time any food came out (yakitori appetizer that my dad had ordered and a salad that my mom had ordered), it had been 35 minutes since we'd ordered. Then a couple single sushi orders my dad ordered came out. That was the last food we saw. 

I called the waitress over and told her that I'd ordered the chef's menu, and 45 minutes later I'd only gotten miso soup (plus the rest of the food my parents ordered hadn't come out). She looked surprised (wasn't she our waitress? and there were only a few people in the restaurant), and she said she'd tell the chef. A few minutes later, she came back to tell us that he wasn't listening to her and we should go talk to him. I went over and told him very nicely that I'd been waiting 45 minutes for a chef's menu, and he hadn't sent out anything but miso soup. He just stared at me. The waitress told me to sit back down and she'd deal with it.

By the time another 10 minutes had passed and we'd still not gotten any more food, my dad asked the waitress to speak to the manager. She told us that the manager had quit and the chefs simply weren't listening to her. By this point we'd been there almost an hour and had to get to our show. My dad asked her to bring us a bill for everything that we'd gotten (two glasses of red wine, a small bottle of sake, miso soup, a salad, two single sushi orders and a yakitori appetizer), and she brought us a full bill for everything we'd ordered, including the chef's menu and all the other food that hadn't come out!! (We refused to pay it.) 

This was the single worst food experience of my entire life. Hands down. Don't EVER eat here under any circumstances. The food that did come was overpriced and very mediocre, and the service was beyond horrendous."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this restaurant has secluded itself to a very, very dark corner of the food court.  The outside is not appealing and the placement of the sushi bar and door are awkward.

The food is also deplorable.  Curry chicken udon noodles tasted like a watery version of cheap instant noodles with lumps of boiled chicken.  The tempura batter was overly floury and undercooked.

The decor is excellent and the service is commendable.  Unfortunately, they need to rework the flow of traffic in their restaurant and upgrade the standards of their menu."}
{"text":"Had a couple of pints of Sapporo and the Salmon Lover special. Great price and great service!"}
{"text":"So I was walking the mall craving sushi and didn't want fast food so I thought despite the rating I was going to give this place a try, more so because I wanted my sushi freshly prepared.

I had no issues with the food, all three rolls ordered were delicious and fresh - my favourite was the super dynamite. The Spicy salmon came in a close second.

My issues with this establishment:

We were seated, and then forgotten about for 15 mins, no water or anything. Finally after I flagged someone down to take our order, the individual said he had to take drink orders first before he took our dinner order... I couldn't understand why since we just wanted water but played along with his request.

while we waited for our waters, tap water that is.. i decided i wanted a miso soup because one didn't come with our orders. so when he brought out our waters, i said we were ready to order and requested the sushi rolls and the soup. 

i got my soup in a timely manner compared to the water but it wasnt warm, and i didnt have it in me to ask for it to be warmed up.

out came our sushi - delicious as mentioned - no issues with it.

than we waited around about 10 mins after we were done to get our bill, now i could understand if they were really busy, but there was only 5 other tables in there with customers.

all in all - take the sushi to go!"}
{"text":"Fresh off a bus ride from Niagara and on my way to wine class, I needed to eat. Tasting 17 wines requires that you have something on your stomach. I was in a bit of a rush but didn't want the food court, so I ducked into Akashiro.

Atmosphere was dark and intimate. I liked the little booths for two.

I ordered a sushi and roll combo with a side of a la carte salmon sashimi. I asked the server to bring the bill ASAP as I had to leave quickly. The service was timely and polite.

The sushi? Well, I've definitely had better, but I was surprised by the quality of the salmon sashimi. It was rich, buttery and cut in nice thick strips. Having said that, the California Rolls were just ok and the other sushi was nothing special.

Probably would not go back unless I was having a massive sushi craving and it was the only place around."}
{"text":"Location: Eaton Center's food court (downstairs)
Price: $$ (moderate)
Service: ?

It is located at the eatery at the Eaton Centre. It is both a restaurant and fast food place. I got my sushi to go, and it comes with a complementary miso soup. I thought that the sushi was decent and the miso soup was really good (it was HOT!). Most food court sushi \"bar\" don't give you the complementary soup, so I thought it was a very nice initiative. Sushi at the food court generally is not very appetizing cause it's left out for a longer period of time and the rice becomes stale and cold. I would like to try to sit down for sushi there to see if there's a difference with taste of the sushi and whether or not they have good service.

Verdict: It's food court food...(don't expect too much)"}
{"text":"We decided on this spot because it was during the busy lunch hour, I was with older ladies who I was worried that the craziness of the crowds would be too much for them and this seemed like a nice and quiet seated area away from everything. The only reason I gave this place 2 stars instead of one was because they gave us sanctuary from the crowd. Food gets one star.

I had already lowered my expectations because we were in a mall, one should not expect awesome food. Tempura was battered with regular \"fish and chips\" batter, thick and heavy. Miso soup was very salty. I got the sushi sashimi bento, the salmon pieces were okay, but the rest not so good. The sashimi was still frozen in the centre so there was that crystalline crush when I chewed it... Gross.  I tried a bit of my friend's chicken teriyaki... Sauce was not bad but the chicken itself was chewy and flavorless. The rice had some nori flakes on it which waa tasty, but there was too much of it so it drowned out the rice instead of making it taste better.

If I was by myself, I would have rather gone elsewhere."}
{"text":"This restaurant at the Eaton Center is pure garbage. 

First, they are highly understaff. One waiter that hardly speaks English is in charge of more than 10 tables and another girl, who's only function from what I can see is to hand out the food and to sit new customers down. We ordered our food...30 minutes in, nothing. Not even our tea was given to us. We ordered a bottle of beer too, nothing. We asked the girl waiter, TWICE, kindly for the food, and she is clueless. We also asked you should at least give us tea and our beer, it never came. Then finally, after 45 minutes, the boy waiter comes and say \"sorry your order sheet that I wrote down what you have order for wet...so what did you order?\" 

Okay so you tell me, that it took you 45 minutes to realize that our paper was WET? And you didn't bother telling us? And hello, we only ordered 4 dishes, really it's that hard for you to remember that? Then you really don't know how to be a waiter. 

Then I ask to speak to the manager, there is NO manager!! Hahaha! So I asked for a business card...but guess what? It took him another 5 minutes to find me a business card! Wow! 

And all this happened while I'm in a rush to watch a musical. Yeah this place is banned!"}
{"text":"This close to Christmas and the mall was crazy - food court was packed and didn't feel like the food court food. 

So I hopped in here with no waiting for a table (love the little booths !) plus had to get away from the noisy mall shoppers (can't believe I'm in the mall of the busiest shopping weekend) 

Ordered salmon and tuna sashimi and tea - to my delight the order was quick and was just great.  Lovely presentation ! 


Love the cost little place with about 20 tables, plus sushi bar seating....decor is plain, but yet again it is in the mall. The service was efficient and very thoughtful. Music was top 10 musac and you could still hear the hussle and bussle of the mall/food court, but that's ok, it was calm inside the restaurant. 

Will certainly return here"}
{"text":"Eaton Center - Urban Eatery - Sushi to go! It's fast and easy.  All the sushi are pre-packaged, so you just have to pick one out.  They come in different sizes and varieties.  Some are nigiri only, some are specialty roll only, and some are a combination of both.

I went with the spicy salmon roll, which was pretty good.  It was on the pricey side for $11, but if you're craving sushi, it does hit the spot.  It was filling and I could barely finish it.  I tried the salmon nigiri that my cowoker ordered, and it was pretty fresh.  Yes, it's not as fresh as the sushi you would have at a restaurant, but it's much better than the pre-packaged sushi you'd find at  the grocery store.

They also give complimentary miso soup, which was also good and full of tofu and seaweed.  I wouldn't come here specifically for the sushi, but if I were in the Eaton Center craving sushi, I'd come back here.  This restaurant is located in the back corner of the food court.  When I was there, I hadn't realized it's also a full service restaurant if you want to dine in.  However, from the reviews about the slow service, it's probably a good thing I did take out."}
{"text":"Thursday dinner - we sat inside.  It was relatively quiet hence service was prompt.  The salad was average and the soup was a bit salty.  Sashimi was fresh and sushi was decent (it wasn't spectacular but it was up to par).  My gf noticed the sushi wasn't wrapped properly as the rice was falling off the sushi roll lol...Overall it was a good meal."}
{"text":"I'm not in Toronto often so I'm rarely at the Eaton Centre. I was surprised to find this restaurant in the mall. More even so because they had a seated area but also a \"fast food counter\". I ordered to Shoyu ramen. It took about 10 minutes for my order to be ready even though it was very busy. I paid 12$ for the bowl which I think was fair.

The broth was perfect and noodles were great. The porc was the star of the dish, it melted on my tongue as soon as I put it in my mouth. Really really good! I was satisfied and full after my bowl."}
{"text":"I've visited the place a couple years ago, service was fine. 

I came back early November and I will seriously never return. I am not one to go above and beyond to a review a place I had a terrible experience at. Actually, I've never had a terrible experience at a restaurant. Sure, there were times when I would have small complaints, but who doesn't? Whenever I read people who review places and claim that the service was absolutely atrocious, I usually think to myself, \"Come on.. It can't be that bad.\" Well, my experience at this place WAS that bad. 

We were greeted by a young male (early twenties perhaps), didn't say hello or anything. He stood there until we said \"for three please\". He grabbed menus and proceeded to walk to the front area of the restaurant. (Didn't even say \"right this way\" or anything similar, LITERALLY JUST WALKED) but whatever, we followed him. He stood and looked around and realized the entire room was full. So he turned around (again, NOT A SINGLE WORD!) and took us around to the back. (I did enjoy this table a lot more as it was more private). We sat down and he dropped our menus off and walked away. Not. A. Single. Word. 

We looked over the menu and decided what we all wanted.. However we were waiting for at least 20 minutes or more for a server. The tables in the front room were getting consistent service from all the other servers. FINALLY the guy who seated us comes, AND JUST STANDS THERE WITH THE MOST BLANK FACE. We said \"We're ready to order.\" And he proceeded to say okay, and so we started saying our orders. Then he stops us mid order to pull out his note pad and pen. Wouldn't this be your first instinct to do if you're not an experienced server? We had to recite what we already just said. We then also had to tell him our drink orders since he didn't even ask. The best part of the order was when one of the people of our party asked for extra chicken in his dish. The server stopped, had the most unimpressed face I've ever seen a server have, he stopped and said \"ummm.....\" And gazed around the restaurant. (I assumed he was searching for another employee to ask if it was possible), I kid you not he waited 20 seconds and said \"no\". We sat there astonished that he said no! We gawked for a few seconds until he said \"....I'll have to check with the kitchen. It will be extra charge\" (well I sure hope it would be extra...)

Anyways, the wait wasn't too bad for our food. Miso soup was good. Edamame was typical edamame. Ramen was not good, I've had better instant ramen. Chicken Don was pretty good, no complaints there. The server did not check on us once. He came when we were done our food, and refilled our waters. (Why thank you, that would have been helpful 15 minutes ago). We then said we were ready for the bill... It took him a long time to come back with the bill and even more time to come back with the debit machine. He did not ask how the meal was or anything. Usually we are generous with our tips, especially even more when we have an amazing server. This gentleman landed a bit fat zero dollar tip. I'm so disappointed in the service of this place."}
{"text":"Food takes forever to come! The table next to me came 15 minutes after I ordered and still they got the food first.  This will be the fiirst and last time I'll come to this POS wannabe Jap restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible service. It took a while for me to get seated and I was the only person waiting in line. You would also think that you would get water once you sit down but nope! You have to actually ask for water. It took over 20 minutes for the server to get my food as well. Food was pricey and average at best. The only redeeming factors would be the decor and the that the food didn't take long to arrive at my table. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"personally, i like the food. everyone complains about the service but i didnt think it was that awful to overrule the good food. the service is slow when it comes to taking orders but that's no problem for me."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy miso ramen and it was not worth my money. The bowl was overpriced and flavourless. I couldn't taste the miso and it seemed as though they forgot to add salt all together. For the price I paid, if I were at a sit down restaurant elsewhere it would come with a big piece of pork belly with side toppings. Whereas here, you need pay extra for toppings that other places would already have included."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at how bad the reviews are for this place. I thought the shrimp tempura udon was good and the Bbq eel roll was delicious! It's a bit on the expensive side for what it is (a restaurant in a food court) but I was happy with my experience."}
{"text":"Sushi not fresh. Miso soup from powder. Salad waaaay too sweet. Service friendly, but made mistakes with the order. Price not worth it. Black dragon roll was okay, but not great."}
{"text":"Ordered sushi + avocado rolls and Philadelphia rolls. The food was of average quality, but quite overpriced. The atmosphere was decent, but the service was some of the worst I've ever experienced. The waiter didn't really wait on us. It was up to us to find him and flag him down."}
{"text":"Service was good.
Food was ok, not the best sushi but good for the place and when you are starving.
Managed to changed the california rolls to salmon rolls in the sushi and noodles combo, so that's nice."}
{"text":"We were in the seated restaurant part.  It's a great place and much more quiet than the food court. 

The service was ok,  but at least very fast. 

The most important is the food,  which was very good.  It was our first time so we tried different sushi rolls and the miso Ramen. It's a bit pricy but the food is good and your are in the Eaton Centre so it ok to me."}
{"text":"I ordered the udon combo with nigiri pieces and a few hours later I felt super bloated. I spent the entire night struggling to fall asleep because of stomach cramps. I ended up throwing up. Diarrhea was also an issue. Do not come here."}
{"text":"One star for the ok food. The plating was nice but be prepared to wait a long time before somebody attends to you even if the restaurant does not appear to be busy. I saw some people leave only because nobody went to take their orders. 

I rarely give one star reviews but unfortunately it was the service that really got to my group. Took a while for somebody to come to take our order. Asked for three glasses of water and we only got two and had to ask again for the last one. Of course it never came. 

Food took a while to come and of course when it came, we didn't have any soy sauce, so trying to get the servers attention was exhausting. Eventually when we got their attention, they started rolling their eyes or sighing. 

Overall, the service can use some significant improvement. I feel they just have to come up with a way to be more efficient because what happens is that everybody is trying to get their attention and then with so many requests at once they tend to forget about the other ones. 

Did I mention it took a while just for us to get the bill and pay? If anything, you would've thought they'd be speedy with that."}
{"text":"Firstly, the food tastes terrible and the portions are way to small. Secondly, you should NOT come to this restaurant...but if you had to go the bento boxes are not as bad as other meals. My biggest mistake was not checking yelp."}
{"text":"How can they manage to have everything made taste so bad ? Expect from miso soup and the seaweed salad which are not made in-house.  Tsk tsk tsk. Don't waste ur money and your time at this restaurant."}
{"text":"15$ for a bowl of nothing. Ordered a spicy miso pork all they gave me noodles, a egg, and soup, and a tiny ice cream scoop of grounded pork. I should have went to Kinton. Never ordered from here again."}
{"text":"The food is really good. The waitresses were very kind, but the service was much too slow. They served us our orders separately and it took more than 30 minutes for the 4th and last plate to be served. I appreciate it if the restaurant was busy, but it was half empty at the time."}
{"text":"Had a sit down meal. I got the tempura lunch meal. Which includes shrimp, sweet potato, sweet pumpkin and eggplant tempura along with udon noodles in a broth. 

Only way to describe it is umami goodness. It was delicious. I would order it again in a heartbeat. In fact I'm already thinking about the next time I will have it again. 

Service was also great."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible
Don't waste your time or money here
Especially when there are so many other places in the Eaton Center food area and around downtown

First, service was AWFUL
The waitress was slow, never checked on us, didn't bring us our bill (I had to go look for someone to bring us a bill)
She also didn't know what was on the menu and was confused by what we ordered (even though it was pictured on the menu)

They are overpriced and the sushi is very meh 

My friend ordered sushi that was supposed to have fresh salmon wrapped around it. Instead they brought something with milled salmon and when we asked about it, we were told a few things - 1. the milled salmon is quicker, 2. there's a new sushi chef who can't wrap the salmon around and 3. they never had it with the fresh salmon (even though it's pictured on their menu)

The waitress was not pleasant or happy and ignored us most of the time (we were there for lunch during the week - it was NOT busy so there's really no excuse)

It cost over $20 for 2 rolls of sushi

Not sure how they even manage to stay open"}
{"text":"This \"restaurant\" seems to offer a more subdued alternative to the chaos that is the Urban Eatery. It's not much different than the food court, however; there's a remarkable volume of noise in here in spite of the walls. Conversation is a challenge for me in these circumstances. 

Menu prices are much higher than nearby sushi alternatives and the waitstaff communicate with minimal effectiveness. They might as well be robots. Menu choices are standard, albeit overpriced."}
{"text":"The sushi here isn't all that great but it isn't terrible. The seaweed salad was a mixture of different types of seaweed and it was pretty gross. The food is expensive but what do you expect from a restaurant inside the Eaton Centre? The service was decent, waiter was nice. Probably won't come back to this one."}
{"text":"The Worst sushi place ever. 
Very poor service , worse quality of sushi even the price was so expensive. Never buy that plz. It's better you go all you can eat having better quality than this place."}
{"text":"Never again.  I consider myself pretty easily impressed by Japanese food.  I guess you could say I have low standards: I almost always love it, even when my fellow diners are not happy.  But this place was just bad: the food was bland, the service was slow, the ambiance was off.  It was just a really mediocre experience."}
{"text":"Friday afternoon. I went there for lunch. Was seated down in a minute or two. Looked like a full house, but there were still a few tables available amd plenty of wait-staff. After waiting ten minites, which I let go because they were busy, someone took my order. I ordered a coke with lemon, miso soup, and two spicy salmon rolls. Twenty-five minutes go by and everyone who came after me is getting their food. Meanwhile I didnt even get my beverage. Finally the girl who took my order comes over and says \"sorry what was your order again?\" I was shocked. I said \"you took my order, how can you ask this?\". She told me they had some problems and she kept looking over my shoulder as if she's getting instructions from the kitchen. I said \"you're telling me you never had my order for almost half an hour?\" Then she started pretending that she doesn't understand me well even though upon my arrival she  had been conversing very fluently and telling me about the dishes. I directly asked her if they've started my food or not she said no so I told her im leaving. I got up and left. She walked away when other customers started staring.

This is the second time they've done this here. I used to be a fan of this place but now they just choose who they serve first and dont follow order. And I guess they lose your order too."}
{"text":"Try: Sexy Roll

This is one of those places where if you don't go you are definitely not missing anything, but if you do end up there, it's not unpleasant enough to provoke a reaction. 

I only had rolls here: the spider (with the soft shell crab), avocado, and sexy. The only one that's memorable was the sexy roll, aside from the name, it's got interesting filling of spicy tuna and eel. And instead of rice and seaweed, it's got the pink soy bean paper. If you want to try something interesting, that's definitely a good choice. The other roll were big as well. 

Service was very mediocre, we got the wrong order, there was never a visit to make sure everything is good, no refill of tea or water... But I guess you can't expect too much in a food court. 

Overall an OK experience. Mysterious Japanese restaurant beside the bathroom in the corner of Eaton Centre food court = check.

{"text":"Stopped into Akashiro for lunch with Yelper Teresa H as we were looking to avoid the hustle and bustle of the Urban Eatery.

We ordered the green tea which came steaming hot and refills were offered quite often.

I decided to go with the Haroo sushi set which consisted of spicy tuna rolls (8 pieces) and assorted sushi (4 pieces) priced at $14.95.  Rolls tasted quite fresh.  I was impressed as I was just expecting food court quality sushi.

Even though the Urban Eatery was swarmed, inside Akashiro, it was quiet and empty at lunch.

I would come back for a peaceful, quiet sushi lunch.  Serenity now!"}
{"text":"Non-existent service. It took forever to order and that wasn't even the worst part. Our food came out separately... why even have a dine-in portion if you are incapable of timing our food to come out at the same time? The worst part is we were never ever served water until we asked for it. You would think they'd noticed that we were eating our food but still had no water...

Sushi also was not served with soy dipping dishes.

Food was nothing spectacular. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"There is a sit down portion and I think a take out portion attached to the restaurant, located in the massive Eaton Center cafeteria. I think this is the only non fast food, actual sit down restaurant in the entire cafeteria. It's also conveniently located right at the escalators, subway stop, and bathrooms. 

The inside sit down part is nicely renovated, and there is a good amount of seating. I came in around lunch time and it wasn't as busy as I thought it would have been. I had a bunch of luggage and tried to ram it under the table with limited success but there was enough space so people could get by anyway. Service was friendly and relatively responsive. Food didn't come out in a timely manner, though. My friend received his food way earlier than I received mine. Don't you hate when that happens?"}
{"text":"This place is located in the basement floor of eatons along with all the other food court restaurants. They have a to go bento sushi area outside of the actual restaurant but it's really really REALLY overpriced for the kind of sushi you get, which isn't that great to begin with. 

The restaurant also has really expensive items. The dish I got (in the image) was almost 20 bucks, and as you can see some sushi pieces and a California roll is definitely not worth that price. You're in downtown and you're surrounded by tons of good sushi restaurants, don't waste your time and money for low quality expensive sushi."}
{"text":"If there are minus star, it will be minus 5 star restaurant.  No tastes on most of menus, poor quality ramen soup base, disorganized services..etc..... Do not waste your money for nothing unless they offer you free food when you are absolutely hungry."}
{"text":"Haven't been back to Toronto for a while and dropped by this place for late lunch. The service was extremely terrible, the male server seemed encountering his 'menstruation' and was unhappy and uninterested in serving you. 

Even if you waved to get his attention, he just completely ignored you and walked by pretending not seeing it.

When you ordered your food, he gave this long face that it seemed that he really, really reluctant to give you service. Then, not sure his pretending or really not understand my order in English.

I ordered a noodle combo mix and a Diet Coke but the latter never arrived on my table. 

Luckily, the food arrived quickly and one did not have to put up with the obnoxious attitude. The sashimi was ok but the yellowtail was not fresh and stale.

The Cali roll was plain and ok.

Most horrible was the ramen, it was tasteless, no flavor at all and it felt like the chef forgotten to put in the seasoning - worst noodle I have ever eaten in N America so far.

Overall, a very unpleasant experience in my own hometown and it was so sad as Toronto used to have many great Japanese restaurants and was also famous of their services 

If I could rate minus, I would give this place a minus five stars"}
{"text":"With the swarming crowds buzzing through the Urban Eatery Food Court at the Eaton Centre, Akashiro is your destination for peace and tranquility.

It's your only option for private dining in the concourse level food court, actually its the first time I've seen a full-service restaurant (alochol / bar & all) located smack dab in a food court!

From the time you step inside you feel as though you have been transported to a quaint little sushi house and the rumbling crowds outside have been matted out.

We wait by the hostess desk infront of the restaurant to be seated. It's almost 6pm but not too busy yet in here and we are kindly seated at the front at wooden table in a dimly lit restaurant, it feels more like a lounge.

We are provided with a menu and our waiter comes to take our drink order. Keeping with the Asian theme we order 2 cups of green tea. It comes out piping hot with that authentic mild flavour.

As we browse through the menu we see mainly traditional Japenese cusine (as expected) but also some other enticing options as well. Our waiter comes over to give us a hand. He does a great job of explaining dishes. We oringinally wanted a beef dish but he apologized that no beef dishes were available today (weird?) however after describing some other dishes were totally sold and had no regrets!

To start:

Spicy Salmon Roll - 8pcs, salmon, green onions, ground chili sauce 
Great flavour, you can tell it was freshly handmade, no wasabi needed, it had a nice subtle kick to it!

Tempura Vegetables -Deep-fried assorted seasonal vegetables 
Nice crispy coating with great crunch and flavour. A definite must try!
Vegetables included sweet potato, acorn squash (my fav), eggplant, zuchini, and a jalepeno with a sweet dipping sauce

Main

Chicken teriyaki -Grilled chicken & vegetables with teriyaki sauce 
Perfectly cooked and tender meat in a sweet teriyaki sauce. Surprising this meal is not served with rice, but our waiter quickly brings us over a cute pot of sticky white rice after we inquired.

Dessert

We were not intending on ordering dessert here but after our waiter went over the desserts menu we were sold once again.

Japanese Angel Fruit Cake
He made us a deal and brought a slice of both flavours to try.
Green tea - not too sweet, light green tea flavour
Black Sesame - just a hint of sweetness, more of a bread & butter flavour
Both the cakes had a sponge cake like texture but they were moist. I can't say I loved the cakes but they definitely weren't bad but not your traditional sugary western style cakes we are so accustomed too.

At the end of our meal our waiter introduced himself as Frankie and told us that he was in fact the manager of the restaurant. We were shocked, to say the least, he was the kindest more gracious waiter I've ever had, very attentive, in fact all the staff here were very attentive and cheerful, clearing our tables, bringing food out in stages as we completed each entree, and never letting our cups of green tea go dry.
He thanked us for coming and gave us a 10% discount on our entire bill and welcomed us to come back again and he would give us a surprise on our return.

I will definitely be returning here! Amazzing service and food! Tranquility hidden among the chaos of a food court! A definite must try!

FYI There are no bathroom in this restaurant, as it is in a food court, no worries its located adjacent to the front entrance, just steps away!"}
