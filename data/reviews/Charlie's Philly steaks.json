{"text":"Horrible service. Girl at the register spilled soda all over the cup of the woman in front of me, couldn't be bothered giving her a napkin after she asked for one and then gave her the wrong change. I should have left, but I really wanted the cheese fries....not worth it, even after I had to wait while the customers behind me received their sandwiches and fries, but not their drinks. Never stopping here again."}
{"text":"Such a unique menu that someone recognized where I was when I tweeted that I got a chicken philly and blueberry lemonade. Good food and service; the wait was not long."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite and the cheesesteak looked so good in the pic. Plus they have some good fries. Got the normal/reg cheesesteak which I got to go and it was placed in a nice big box. The problem with that is my sandwich got super soggy. Fries stayed crispy but I like it better when they wrap the sandwich and put the fries in a cup. 

Overall the inside of the sandwich was good. Next time I will have to opt for provolone on the reg sandwich as they put white American which is not the classic cheesesteak cheese in my book. 


Service could be nicer but what do you expect from a food court in the mall"}
{"text":"Avoid...line to order horrible,  we waited forreevveerr... and eventually went to wrap place across food court which had better service and same type of menu."}
