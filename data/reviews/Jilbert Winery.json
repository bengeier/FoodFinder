{"text":"Beautiful location unfortunately: worst wine I have ever tried in my life. Not even tolerable."}
{"text":"We had a surprise anniversary party here. It was PERFECT! Dave was extremely accommodating. Melissa, the caterer, did an outstanding job. Everyone was raving about the food. At night with all the lights lit there is a wonderful ambience. All of the guests expressed how much they enjoyed this unique venue. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I love it here. So peaceful and serene. Dave the owner is so friendly. Wine is delicious. Stopped in today and had a nice refreshing recharge with Cardinal Sin."}
{"text":"Jilberty winnery is an awesome place from dinners, receptions, weddings u name it they can do it if you ask. Nice thing is you can sample the wine before making a deccision to have for dinner. My personal favorite is the Honey mead wine to be able to sample and try this wine you must be 18 or legal drinking age and parent supervisor but don't worry kids they also sell can soda for a dollar to drink with dinner or your meal. Just ask the staff for details."}
{"text":"I love checking out local wineries so when I was booked to officiate a wedding at Jilbert, I was thrilled!  We had a lovely ceremony outdoors and the upstairs area which can be reached through a walkway as well (no worries for handicapped folks!) is absolutely gorgeous and has a lovely rustic feel.  I think they had about 75 guests.  I enjoyed a few glasses of wine while I was there and went home with 4 bottles, 3 of which were the Honey wine!  Yum!  The bottles and glasses were both reasonably priced too!  I have recommended it a number of times already!"}
{"text":"So my family hosted my wedding shower for me and my wife in their upstairs room of their barn. 

I loved it. They were very accommodating, allowing my family to bring our own food in. All the wine was provided by the winery. Before the festivities started each table took turns doing some wine tastings at their tasting bar and picked out a couple bottles for their table. 

For the person who gave their wine bad reviews, I think they are probably just trying to be snooty or didn't try very many of their wines. While I didn't enjoy them all I did find a couple varieties I really enjoyed and took a bottle home with me.

If I was hosting a similar party in the future I will definitely keep them in mind. I loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for wine. Nice,  laid back atmosphere. We decided to have an event here for 50 people. You pay to get the room, tables and linens. Everything else you provide yourself. Seeing as how pretty much the only thing the venue had to do was put table cloths out for us I was disappointed that the linens were all wrinkled. They looked like they had been stored all balled up then placed on the tables. When we told the owner he replied \"well, they're cotton they get wrinkly\" ummm, what?!! On top of that several had stains and water marks.  I literally had my husband bring up our own steamer so I could atleast try to fix the wrinkles but unfortunately we did not have time before the event to do so.  The room was cold because it was winter so we asked to have the fire places turned on. The owner sort of argued that once our guests arrived it would get so hot and advised not to turn them on. Finally it was so cold we demanded they be turned on.  The room did not get overly hot as he had advised.  I would return just to have some wine outside but I would have reservations about hosting an event here again."}
{"text":"A great host with free wine tasting before dinner followed by a delicious meal and more wine with live music in a century old barn."}
{"text":"My husband and I just got married at Jilbert Winery this past weekend. We had an outdoor ceremony in the back and our reception in the barn. Both settings were beautiful! We had received compliments on the barn where we held the reception. It was the perfect size for our small wedding (approximately 80 people). 

Dave was so accommodating, kind, and knowledgable about both his wine and beer products. We also received multiple comments on the taste of the craft beer and wine slushies (my favorite!) The food was AMAZING! And the caterer, Melissa from Blue Ribbon Catering out of Norwalk, was so accommodating to us as well and willing to work with us to make sure we had exactly what we wanted for our menu selections on the big day. 

Overall, the venue was beautiful. The ambiance in the barn was breathtaking and our guest thoroughly enjoyed themselves. We did wish that the dance floor was a little larger but we do understand that it is a restructured barn and that for the safety of all, the space was limited. 

We are so happy that we choose to celebrate with our friends and family at Jilbert Winery on our wedding day!"}
