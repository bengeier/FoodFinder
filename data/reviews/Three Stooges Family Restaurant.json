{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast before a long day of moving and it was a great choice! We both got the egg skillets and it came with so much food it fed us for lunch as well. The inside and outside seating is great and there's tonnes of room. My only complaints are about the broken AC inside (those poor waitresses!) and the uncomfortable chairs on the patio.

I'd say this is the best breakfast option in Port Credit."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for our bill as long as it took us to clear the table and that was as long as it took to bring the food, all are too long.  I had ti
me to wait, get pissed off, download the help app, set it up and write this review. The staff works hard but management has not scheduled enough of them. The food was great but this place will test your patients so come with an open schedule."}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch and a side of attitude. 

I must say that the portion sizes are amazing and the food here is quite delicious.

Although beware! 
Me and my family went here for lunch today and were extremely displeased with the level of service we received. It was our first time trying this restaurant. Our server had about four other tables and you could feel the level of discomfort among everyone in the building. 

Once our server arrived at our table we began to place our order. Make sure you know what you want and don't ask any questions! I asked if they were serving the breakfast special still and she said \"No, it would be too expensive for you because it is not offered on the regular menu.\" Taken back by her comment, I decided to order their eggs. She interrupted me again and said no you can have the special. The young lady in our party simply asked what type of salad came with her wrap and our server hissed her teeth and rolled her eyes and responded \"seriously... its green salad. Which one do you want.\" Feeling like we truly interrupted her day, we let her tell us what to order so we could leave at this point. After our meal and several other smirky comments from yet another server, we paid and left as fast as we could. 

I feel like in todays world, consumers have become so transparent. Websites like these allow those to give instantaneous feedback to business owners. Seeing as you are operating in a service industry, it would be a strong business strategy to provide a service to your customers that make them want to return. I have never left an establishment feeling so belittled and offended."}
{"text":"After hearing a bunch of people rave about this place, I decided to convince some friends of mine to try this place out with me, and I really wish I hadn't. 

We were seated immediately,  and our orders taken promptly but that is when the urgency of the service ended. After 25 minutes without food the waitress came and apologized for how long the food was taking and promised us that ours would be the next out. That would later be proven untrue. Another 30 minutes went buy without even our starters making an appearance. 

After a grand total of 50 minutes after ordering, our food arrived. I had the breakfast skillet and for the most part that was decent (the only reason they deserved one star at all) however my toast was bizarre as the top two pieces were proper toast as I had ordered, but the slice underneath had garlic butter on it as if they had accidently made garlic bread and just threw it under the toast. 

One friend said his burger was over cooked and bone dry, and my other friend was upset that there was no buffalo sauce in the wrap, just a bit placed in the open end of it, to which the waitress replied matter-of-factly \"well yeah, they're dipped\" 

Overall a horrible experience and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered the BLT.Bacon under cooked,no butter on the toast.Frozen fries.Will not be back."}
{"text":"Basically your typical family restaurant with good old comfort food.  Food was fairly good, huge portions.

Service is very slow and very poor.  I had to wait over 15 minutes before my waitress approached the table and it did not appear to be busy at all.  My order was wrong, my pop was empty before I received my meal and it was not until 15 minutes after I received my meal and I was almost done that my waitress asked me if I wanted a refill.  If refills are free and you notice my glass is empty, why bother asking me if I want a refill?  Just bring it.

Will try them again in 3 months, hopefully by then they will iron out the kinks and the service, since Port Credit really needs a good family restaurant.  If it is the same again, there are plenty of other restaurants that want my money."}
{"text":"This was very bad dining experience. My family and I went on a Friday evening (which wasn't surprisingly busy) and we waited 55 minutes before our food arrived. We heard other tables around us complaining about the same thing.
once the food arrived, it wasn't very good. The portions were very big but it was quite bland. We asked to speak to the manager and we were told there wasn't one on site."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB!  Huge portions at fantastic prices, amazing location and great service! What's not to like?!  My fav go-to place in Port Credit.  Oh .. and the sweet potato fries ...mmmmm mmmmmm :)"}
{"text":"Dropped in on a Thursday just before noon. Only 2 other tables occupied so no problem getting seated. Place has enough seating for probably 75 at least. Daily specials are posted on the board as you come in. Menu is quite extensive. Tons of items. All day breakfast seems to be a hit. Wasn't in the mood for breakfast though so tried one of the specials Vienna Schnitzel with grilled veggies and hashbrowns. Also had the beef dip with poutine at the table. Servings were massive (see pic). Food was hot and fresh. Service was quick and friendly. Prices were good for the size of the servings. Had to box up half of the order for take out it was that big. Will definitely return for breakfast one day. Great location. Right beside the Credit River on Lakeshore."}
{"text":"The Good: 
- food was great! I had French toast and bacon. Others in our party had a skillet and breakfast platters.
- service was friendly and quick.
- the place was packed on a Sunday morning so obviously its popular for a reason

The Bad
- poor layout with too many tables jammed in
- the front door area is small so when it gets busy there is actually no place for everyone to be.
- under-staffed so even when tables came up free they couldn't seat people. One poor guy (possibly manager) was running around like a crazy person trying to serve tables, clean tables, seat customers etc.
- food portions are so huge that all the food doesn't fit on the table which makes it difficult to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"Big portions, yes.  Ordered over medium eggs and they came with a fully hard yolk.  Good thing I like eggs any which way otherwise I wouldn't be a happy camper.  If your not a fan of hollandaise sauce thus place may not be for you, it comes on almost everything!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, had breakfast a month ago and good food, huge portions, You Gotta Eat Here worthy. service was extremely slow. Went today for late lunch at 3pm. Good Friday and nice weather had people out so place was packed. 2 servers having to manage drinks, food, running payments AND clearing tables. Stood waiting for 10 minutes without even being acknowledged as we watched empty tables not being cleaned. Atrocious service, left because we could see people seated and waiting for food, all looking very unhappy and annoyed. Just wasn't willing to wait an hour for food. Really too bad the service is so bad, you would think they would have been prepared for a holiday, then again, even when they do have staff it is still slow..."}
{"text":"I recently visited this restaurant with a friend for dinner.  I had been there for breakfast a few times and was impressed with the price, quality and quantity so thought I would give the dinner menu a shot.  I ordered onion rings as an appetizer and the banquet burger with Greek salad as my main.  The onion rings were plentiful and what I had visualized, but they could have used some seasoning.  The banquets burger was huge but nothing to write home about.  It was a little dry but nothing an extra squirt of ketchup couldn't fix.  The Greek salad was nice as it had lots of ingredients and not just lettuce, but the dressing left something to be desired.  I was sure to scan the table around me on the way out and all the meals were huge portions and looked tasty.  I'll be going back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Good portions, courteous staff. Ordered the cod and chips with coleslaw. The cod was perfect...not too soft nor crunchy. The slaw was alright. I substituted the fries for the hash browns...and I'd def go back for the has browns. ..the portions were huge! Overall I'd recommend this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"I always know when I look back on a place I want to review and I struggle assigning a star rating it's because it was so good I don't know if it was a 4 or a 5, OR it wasn't memorable and deserves under a 3. In this instance unfortunately it was the latter, however it comes close enough to a 3 that I'm willing to round up for now.

The pros:
 - hefty portion size
 - nice diner feel (something Port Credit needed)
 - Clam Chowder soup was made fresh that day and was pretty good
 - All day breakfast options

The cons:
 - Tight parking lot
 - Staff weren't very present despite it not being very busy
 - As is the issue with many places like this, the menu has too many options thus lacks identity. I'm not a fan of places that put every kind of food on the menu. The result is nothing stands out because you end up not specializing in anything, you do everything sorta OK
 - Case and point my clubhouse sandwich was underwhelming, I asked for mayo on it and was given two packages to spread on myself

As others have mentioned I think there are a few kinks that need to be worked out here, so I'm not writing this location off, but I will be coming back in a few months to sample their breakfast and other items before adjusting my review up or down a star.

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Sat ourselves on the patio. Cob webs and tiny spiders on the railing. I cleaned it myself. 
Table was dirty. I cleaned it myself.
Waitress took our order. 45 minutes later, our food arrived.
Yes, 45 minutes later. 
She asked my husband if he wanted a refill on his drink. She did not ask me. Our glasses were both empty.
I had the grilled chicken and shrimp. Chicken was uber dry, although seasoned nicely. Shrimp was rubbery, but otherwise ok.
The veggie in my plate consist of turnips, carrots and zucchini mush. 
Mashed potatoes were unremarkable.
Hubby had halibut and chips. Fish was ok, a tad dry. Fries had a hint of cinnamon taste. Yes, cinnamon.
Waitress never came back to ask if everything was ok. She brought us 2 containers to go. Portions were huge, but it's not something I wanna take home.
Never again. Ever."}
{"text":"Love this place.   Great prices for hungry folks!   My husband was not able to finish his Deluxe Burger($12) !   Crazy for a guy who can eat  2 Double Big Mac Combos!.  I love the Western Sandwich & soup ($8).  My son loves the poutine!   Breakfast is great here too.   Eggs Benedict was delicious (3 eggs!).  The boys enjoyed their Steak & Eggs!    I think I'll have to try their Skillet plate one day as they are huge & look amazing? just love the Western so much ).   Their hash browns rock!  Enjoy !"}
{"text":"Amazing fish and chips but the tartar sauce was underwhelming (didn't even taste like tartar sauce). Decent prices but massive portions but you gotta pay $4 if two people would like to share. Old school diner feel, very warm and welcoming atmosphere. Prompt service. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Lots of food. Tastes good. Inexpensive."}
{"text":"We came here believing it to be a good portioned restaurant from reading all the reviews. 

To be fair, they DID have fairly big portions. I got the eggs benedict (with 3 poached eggs!) which was actually very filling. 
BUT my hollandaise was very runny, which ruined the whole experience."}
{"text":"Food is always good. But the owner was apprently working in the kitchen and refused us lunch at 12pm who does that.  But our waitress was very adamant on getting it to us and said that's bulls hit when we told her what he said. Other than that great place."}
{"text":"I went with my family a couple of days ago and have a mixed review but overall would say it's a good spot.
Yes, the portions are monstrous - even the kids size portions are adult sized. I ordered the BLT sandwich and it was quite good  (I read a previous review on here and I must say, I do like to put the mayo on myself). It came with enough fries to feed three people and they were good.
My husband ordered onion rings as an appetizer and they were great as well. For his meal he got the schnitzel and said it was only okay. My daughter ordered the pasta with meat sauce and had a bit of a gastro later that evening. We looked at some of the other things being ordered and the fish and chips do look great.
The waitress we had was friendly and we were seated quickly. It was VERY busy but we didn't wait too long for anything. For three people and the amount of food we got, the bill was reasonable. There is a lot on the menu and I would like to give a couple of other things a try.
I was disappointed that there wasn't more of a Three Stooges theme going on. I went in expecting to see some on the television but they don't go that far. There are a couple of things on the walls but that's about it."}
{"text":"... What can I say.... My husband and I were super excited to try this place out based on reviews. We went for Sunday brunch and were mildly disappointed. First off, this restaurant CLEARLY needs more staff. We waited pretty long to be seated let alone acknowledged in this restaurant. Waitresses were walking past us like we were invisible. Finally a waitress seated us after waiting 
10-15 min. Once seated we decided to order fast because the place was packed. My husband ordered the classic breakfast which consisted of eggs, toast, their \"famous hashbrowns\", and bacon... and I ordered blueberry pancakes with bacon and their \"famous hashbrowns\". The food was nothing special. The pancakes were massive and cooked properly but all the food lacked flavour... The cooks should use Salt and pepper, it goes a long way. The coffee was \"meh\", and the bacon was the star of our plates... Crispy and not greasy. Now for the \"famous hashbrowns\"???? What on earth is famous about these shredded, flavourless, mushy potatoes??? We were the most excited to try those out but we were soooooo disappointed. These were by far the worst hashbrowns we've ever experienced in a restaurant.  The prices were great for the area I'll give them that. When we finished our meal we both said \"Well, now we know to stick to Bobby's or Denny's\"."}
{"text":"Awful stale food cooked badly. I don't understand how people can give good reviews because the portions are huge? I'd rather have a regular or small sized portion of decent fresh food than this sorry excuse for food! 
The onion rings were ok, the rest was horrid - obviously from frozen huge chicken cutlet.
No excuse for this place to stay in business unless they make huge improvements - primarily quality of all meal ingredients and a real cook."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this was the worse dining experience I have had in a long time.  We sat ourselves with the last customers food still on our table.  To get them to clear the plates, wipe the table and get us water and menus took almost an hour.  When the food finally came in another half hour, the fish and chips were bland and the seafood pasta had one mussel, some fish, and the rest all pasta.  The waitress took her time doing everything instead of hustling since the place was crowded.  Needless to say I will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Went here during Buskerfest for dinner with the kids. Not a long wait at all despite the full tables inside and out. 

Food:
We ordered the banquet burger to share and a kids burger (to share, as well). Food took about 45 minutes to arrive. 
Both burger dishes came and was surprised to see that the kids burger was the same size as the regular one, a shocking 12 Oz. Massive amount of fries too!
Taste was good. Liked the seasoning and Cooked perfectly.  Bun was average but not distracting from the burger. overall, it was good but  i felt like it was missing that secret ingredient. Good but just not amazing.  Fries had this indescribable taste that I can only imagine is from the oil. Not sure. Even tho we ordered one meal per 2 of us, we still had leftovers. 
My husband was happy about the burger and fries. 

Service:
Won't get into my complaints about service because Our server was genuinely apologetic, saying he started only 2 weeks ago. The restaurant also opened 3 months (?) 
If they just beef (Har har) up their service and fix the kinks in the kitchen, this place could do really well!!

Servings are HUGE and everything looked super tasty and exciting."}
{"text":"I was in the area and had a craving for fish and chips. I haven't been to Helens in years so I decided to venture over there. To my surprise Helens was no more. This places looked like a diner so I figured they should have decent fish and chips.

This place definitely has a diner feel but not that suspicious, grungy diner type of feel. It looks clean and welcoming. I walked in and grabbed a menu and stood in front of the podium waiting for someone to acknowledge me. Unfortunately that never happened. As I stood there waiters walked by, customers were brought their food and cashed out right in front of me. There were about three waiters that day and they all made eye contact with me and came to the podium cashed out their customers and walked away. I was kind of in shock. I eventually asked a waiter if this is the right spot to place an order. She said yes I'll be with you shortly and never came back. She did a lap around the restaurant and made a drink while I waited. One of the waiters FINALLY came over and said did anyone take your order yet (5-10 minutes later) probably because I looked so dumbfounded. Still I was pleasant and politely said no. She assumed it was take out because I was flying solo and I told her id like to dine in.

Enough about that crappy service I'll focus on the food. The menu is overwhelming, so many choices! The guy behind me was eating steak and mash which looked divine and the guy in front was eating fish and chips. I decided on cod fish and chips with a sub poutine. I also had a Shirley temple and a rum and coke (30 bucks). The food was good I have no complaints. The portion sizes are huge! I did not even finish half of my food. I would definitely come back to try other items on their menu. The server redeemed herself by being informative and attentive. She explained to me that they make their pasta sauce, mashed potatoes, gravy and tartar sauce from scratch. I definitely appreciate that in a restaurant.  I just hope next time the service is a bit more on point."}
{"text":"Huge portions. Great food. Can't wait to be back here. Craving the Buffalo Caesar wrap!  Gravy comes in a soup bowl!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness this place closed at the end of September, 2015. 
The new \"Captain Robins Family restaurant\" is very good. Large portions of tasty \"regular food\"!! Attentive friendly service!!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today. Had the French onion soup. It was good but super salty! Good sized portions for the price tho."}
{"text":"Got smoked salmon with poached eggs. It was very good. The place was recently renovated and looks very clean."}
