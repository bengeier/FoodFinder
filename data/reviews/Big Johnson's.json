{"text":"My wings were undercooked, tasteless and downright bland.  The burger was also bland.  The fries were meh (from the freezer).  They didn't really have anything special on tap either.  I just returned from a trip overseas, had been craving some standard North American dishes, and I swear I had better from areas that barely knew what a burger was.  They messed up my friend's food as well.  She had a wrap, and came out with two two-bite-sized soft tacos (with minimal fillings).  \"Sorry, we ran out of wrap.\"  A little later, we noticed the table behind us ordered a wrap, and came as a wrap, and had at least quadruple the amount of filling.  We asked about it, and our waiter told us \"Guess they found some?\" and hurried away to another table.  They could of at the very least offered something to make up for it, or came back to inform her before making/serving it.  The service was terrible, it took us almost 3 hours to dine there.  We were completely neglected the whole time by our waiter.  We had to hound him down for basically everything except the forks and knives that were already set on the table.  He came by at the end to ask us \"How was the food and service?  Mediocre?  *tilting-hand motion*\", signalling to us that even he knows how bad our experience was (that or he might have overheard our disgruntled discussion).  This was a yesterday (Thursday) night, on probably the last patio day in the year.  Though the patio was packed, they only had about six tables indoors.  I live nearby and they just opened about a month ago(?), so I might try this again in a year (only due to convenience) but from what I have seen, they need to completely overhaul their operations.  Perhaps dumb down the menu and get a few things right first?  Having a few good items sure outweighs a tonne of bland, extremely-mediocre food."}
{"text":"Disappointing overall. The food was actually pretty good, and they have a vast menu that's reasonably priced. But what made our experience poor was our distracted and absent waiter, along with the loud and awful rock/punk music. I thought I was going to a bar on Church St, not in Oshawa! Also, they only accept cash still. That's pretty weak for a business. This place has potential but I won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this used to be the village rainbow...   I stopped by here on Saturday Night to meet some friends for a quick (few) drinks before heading over to Woody's.  It was Satuday Night before Halloween so errthin was packed on the strip....except for this place.  Though they did a good effort to trun this place into a dance-athon like other places, it was just empty.  The music was kinda cool actually.  There were 4 dollar pints..so cheap too!  I'll try coming back here another night.."}
{"text":"\"Big Johnson's\"... hmm... yes homo?  Ya - I know, kinda vain.  But I wanted to stop by a place with the same name as me -- the Johnson-iest Johnson in the world.  We stopped by for a drink and didn't have any food.  The bartender was nice and quick - tallboy specials were only $5.  Nothing wrong with that.  If you removed the posters and the rainbow flags from this joint, it could easily be confused for any Puck N' Wings.  So - not very remarkable, but then again - sometimes you just want a cheap drink at an unpretentious bar.  However, I noticed their email address is 'iambigjohnsons@gmail.com'... so, I finally discovered who took my 1st choice for my email address... bastards."}
