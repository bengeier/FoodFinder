{"text":"We found this little gem on Groupon (it was a wine / apply promo ).  After a lovely evening we had  to leave a fantastic review. Great tapas.  Great deal on the wine, fantastic service, good prices on the menu  and this great jazz guitarist on Friday night.   Quiet enough to carry on a conversation without yelling.  Highly enjoyable.  We will be back even without the coupon."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for something a little different with really good food. Hard to find outside of downtown Calgary and yet here is a hidden gem at Heritage and Macleod Trail south. Quiet ambience with a nice decor, comfortable chairs and relaxed feel. Started with Arabata salad - nice light balsamic dressing. My wife had the flaming Saganiki - excellent. Ordered the rabbit and polenta special - amazing! My wife had the seafood platter - a huge selection of seafood in a very tasty sauce. Finished off with a Tiramisu.  Enjoyed this surprise find and will be back with others!"}
{"text":"We stopped in as we do like wine and appies.  It was just ok.  Downtown prices which was a bit over the top.  Overall pretty disappointed to be honest but we will let them figure everything out as it is fairly new and try it one more time.  The meat all were good...the gnocchi not so much.  The meat and cheese tray was a COMPLETE RIP OFF."}
{"text":"Last night I had an occasion to both each and draw caricatures at the next-door wine & appetizers restaurant located off of McLeod Trail and heritage Drive.  An excellent experience was had by all as far as I could tell. I think my caricature drawing feature had something to do with it!  Also, the bigger and most important feature at any dining establishment is the hired help. I have to say that Daniel and Ayrann were both super waitresses, and never once took on the role of 'hired help.' Instead I was constantly wondering which one was the owner.   I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Nice place to come for appies and wine. We had the truffle fries , flaming cheese and shrimp. The cheese was sharp  The shrimp appy was delicious. We will be back"}
{"text":"When we walked in the restaurant we noticed there are two seating sections: one was completely empty & had a guy behind a piano playing music while the other section was where all the customers were seated. Anyway, that was a little weird but you could still hear the live music quite well.   The orders were placed & the wine was poured & as the food kept coming, the smiles got bigger & bigger.   My only drawback to this place is that some of the portions, and notice I say some, were little small.   The food was good specially the scallop avocado.  Also the coffee & desserts were to perfection.   I would definitely recommend the Garlic toast & Dolmades too. :))   Server/ Host knowledge: 4 Server/host attitude: 4.5 Fast service: 4 Food Menu: 4 Drinks Menu: 4 Food quality: 4.5 Food Portion: 3 Ambience: 4.5 Distance to other tables: 4 Cleanliness: 4.5 Comfort: 4.5 Waiting time to get seated: 5 Price: 4"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh ingredients, low prices, uptown adult only dinning experience!  $35 tasting menu ($20 for lunch). Great for a business lunch or romantic dinner.   Definitely a cut above most of the restaurants I've been to in the South. You used to have to travel downtown for a restaurant this good - not anymore!  Try anything Italian on the menu... We quickly realized the chef is Italian, by tasting the pasta dishes, and finding out the deserts are made in-house! Tiramisu, Tomato bocconcini salad and Ravioli were excellent!  Also, the restaurant itself is completely renovated. Very comfortable seating with a romantic ambiance at night.  Next to London Drugs on Heritage and Macleod."}
{"text":"This place was pretty average. I ordered gluten free pizza, the toppings were great. Only complaint is the base was a bit sweet.  Over priced for the quality."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Next Door Wine Bar for dinner with a groupon that I had purchased. The groupon included a bottle of wine and the Chef's board. On top of that we ordered the Arancini, Flaming Cheese, Bruschetta Flatbread, and Beet Salad. All in all the meal was pretty average with the highlights being the Chef's board and the Bruschetta Flatbread. The service was very attentive, although they did bring all of our dishes out at the same time which kind of bothers me but that's not a big deal. The place is worth a try, especially if you live in the area. *Visited August/17"}
{"text":"My dad had his 60th birthday/retirement party here. We had half of the space to ourselves and had a dedicated bartender and server for the 30-40 of us.   There was enough space to stand and mingle before dinner even with the tables set for dinner. The food was good, but probably would have been better if they weren't trying to cook 30-some meals all at the same time. The service was excellent and all had a good time."}
{"text":"We went to  Next Door Wine Bar for a date night.  We loved the ambience  as it was a date night for us  It was a great find and we were totally pleased!!  The food  was great , we had the Chefs Charcuterie  Board oh and did i mention the desserts.  You have to try ....  The service was awesome - they made you feel really welcome  and kept checking on you :) We will be back many more times to come !!"}
{"text":"Took my parents here for dinner the Thursday after mother's day.  Pros: - our waitress was friendly and polite - some of the food was quite good, the calamari, the gambertti and the shrimp saganaki all had great flavors and the seafood was cooked perfectly.  Cons: - the service was very slow. From when we walked in and were sat it took 20 minutes to get a drink. It was obvious that our waitress was the only one working on the wine bar side and I doubt she was getting any help from the other staff.  - The other staff working, excluding our waitress, were borderline rude. When we walked in we were stared at by unfriendly faces. The other server that dropped off our food scowled at my mother when she asked for tatziki for the calamari, didn't say a word in response and marched away... we never got the tatziki from her and asked our own server when she came by. Keep in mind it was supposed to come with the dish... - my mother had the charcutrie board and one of the meats was a smoked sausage that was terrible. It was inedible, I tried a bite and I couldn't even chew it.  - I had the arancini and it was tasteless and soggy as opposed to crunchy.   Bottom line: I wouldn't go back here. There are other restaurants in the city that do tapas and it's much better."}
