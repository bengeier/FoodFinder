{"text":"awesome korean restaurant! I went with a couple friends and we all got different things so I got to try all of them. their spicy pork ramen is the bomb. I got the seafood pancake which was also really good and it's a lot for the price. Definitely recommend trying this place out. Adorable servers too!"}
{"text":"This establishment is located in the plaza downtown. I recently came here in search for a Korean place near my hotel which would host a group of people Kantapia was not an option as the place is tiny in comparison and always full. The waitress who served us was fluent in Chinese as well as Korean and English of course..The restaurant looked deserted we did not know what to expect from the food and frankly after dining at Chinatown the night before I thought things could not get much worse. I as well ordered the Bi Bim Bap with beef came in a stone pot also had the Galbi I cant get use to the portions in this city they are tiny compared to in NY. But all things aside the food was great will return."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonably priced too. I tried the bibimbap and seafood pancake, while my husband tried the sushi. Pretty tasty and well located. They were also child friendly, which is a big plus for us. 

I think that if you are ever on the main, this great Asian addition is a great place to check out."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly great! I had the bibimbap with beef, and it was served just right -- in a hot stone bowl that actually sizzled. It was as good as any I've had! I also got to try their wonton soup, which had the very tasty addition of sesame oil. Somehow I hadn't been expecting the food here to be as good as it was, and I was very pleasantly surprised."}
