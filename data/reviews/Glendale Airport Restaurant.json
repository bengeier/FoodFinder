{"text":"Went here for breakfast this morning just to find the restaurant has closed permanently according to the person in the store. Gave a star just because you have to."}
{"text":"This place is closed for business:( too bad, we loved it. We will miss you! Thank you for the time you were here."}
{"text":"We are a group of 6 ladies that pick a different resturant every 2nd sat. of the mo. It's just for fun ( no cell phones allowed lol). My choice was the Glendale Airport resturant this mo. Worth a try folks. Good food very friendly and because we had Calif. visitors we had kids today. They even have a little play area for kids. It truly is a family friendly, price is right and portions are big."}
{"text":"We just got home from breakfast at this great place!  Food is good and plentiful and  watching all the planes from the outdoor patio was great!  I think being here early on the weekend is the key.  Lots of activity.  Service is excellent and food a good value."}
