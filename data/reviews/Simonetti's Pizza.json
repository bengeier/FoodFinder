{"text":"Great pizza but poor service. I called and was put on hold for over 5 minutes so I hung up and called back. I was then put on old AGAIN for 5 minutes. When the person finally answered she was in no way apologetic. Also, it was a Tuesday night an hour before closing, so I doubt they were busy. This is no longer my go to pizza place. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area. I don't know about there other Italian dishes because I can't help but eat pizza every time I come here. So good. Very large NY style pies. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This review should be a 2.5 but since Yelp doesn't allow half stars in user reviews, I'm rounding up because of the friendly customer service.

First, their white pizza is REALLY good. As good as I recall ever having. However, their chicken parm sandwich is so disgusting it's definitely the worst I've ever had. It looked and tasted like it was a frozen breaded chicken breast heated in a microwave. Soggy looking pale yellow breading, not crisp or golden brown as you may expect. It was a thin cutlet that took up perhaps 3/4 of the bread lathered in the blandest sauce - tasted like they opened a can of tomato paste, gave it a dash of salt and pepper, and added water. Chicken parm is a staple of Italian cuisine so it's a hard to give this a pass. 

Will definitely be back for  the white pizza though."}
{"text":"Three strikes, you're out. We love to support local business, however the service continues to be non-existent. The last 3 visits, the restaurant was not busy & yet we still had trouble getting someone to take our order or bring the check when finally were able to complete a meal. We were served food without utensils and charged for a 'pot of coffee' but only received one cup. We we never offered refills. At each of our visits, we have not been offered refills on any drink, including water. We've informed the manager on previous visits about the poor service. We decided to give it one last try & much to our disappointment poor service continues. We won't be back & do not recommend this restaurant. 

We did try the owner's more upscale restaurant and the food and service were exceptional. Maybe the servers from Lily's can come train the servers at Simonettis."}
{"text":"Do not order the lasagna it is by far the worst I've ever had.  I've had pizza there and it was good."}
{"text":"Good local pizza joint with a small and very simple area to dine.  I wish they delivered but they do not.  We tried the supreme pizza and a stromboli.  The pizza was really good and the crust texture and taste nearly perfect.  The stromboli was good as well although a little too much italian salted meat.  It began to taste more like a salty sandwich with cheese more so than a stromboli.  Regardless though, the employees were friendly and I'll be back to try some other options.  Give it a shot...this is a great spot in an area with very limited options (I moved from a large city though)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Homemade pizza dough and a family fun bunch of people with great customer service.

The dough is not too thin and not too thick.. just right. YUM!!!"}
{"text":"The staff is great and the pizza is even better. Nothing fancy just good pizza."}
{"text":"A wonderful little gem we found that made moving from Charlotte to Belmont a lot easier. Very good pizza! Staff is friendly. Wished that they would deliver."}
{"text":"I went in here about 4 months ago for the first time. When i first walked in all i could think about was how hot it seemed in there. My love for pizza didn't care about that so i sat down and ordered a large peperoni with extra sauce \" Yes i know i went way out there on my pizza choice\"  Fast forward a few minutes later and boom here comes heaven on a plate. I ate the entire pizza in one sitting. I eat pizza a few times a month and i have to say its one of the best tasting pizzas i have ever had. The toppings were placed well and the cheese was cooked well but the thing i loved the most was the sauce. It tasted so much better then i had expected it to. I couldn't recommend this place enough to people. Sadly because of work i haven't been able  to go back but my family has been a few times since then and they tell me how Great the food is."}
{"text":"Worst white pie ever! Do not recommend it at ALL! :P I was like where is the spinach....and why does the white pie taste like butter and not garlic...,,"}
{"text":"We always get a perfect pizza here!  The crust is perfectly crisp and chewy and the sauce is divine--you can see chunks of tomato and fresh basil.  We usually order the Meatball (thin slices of giant meatballs). I have ordered Manicotti here, my only diversion from the pizza, and it was fantastic as well.  The staff is friendly and the owner (local) is often visible in the restaurant, which I find to be typical of quality establishments.  In my opinion, the value is great for the product you get.  The prices are comparable to the chain pizza restaurants, but you are getting personal, small-town service and an incredibly tasty product.  Simonetti's is not close to my house, but we make the drive to get a great pizza (we have ALL of the chains within a few miles of us but never go there)."}
{"text":"I've died and gone to buffalo chicken pizza heaven! Seriously, the best I've ever had. Chunks of blue cheese, bacon, chicken, caramelized onions, and a creamy buffalo sauce adorned this masterpiece. 

I try to be unbiased in my reviews and evaluate a restaurant's products as objectively as possible, not just based on whether it's my favorite style. Having said that, Simonetti's crust is my favorite kind and they make it perfectly. It's the handtossed type that has enough body to hold up to the toppings. It's not super flat like some NY style. The outer edge of the crust is deliciously chewy and crispy. The sauce is nicely flavored. It has small chunks of tomatoes, which I found to be superior to the typical tomato paste-based sauces that are so common eleswhere. 

I also got a small side salad. The blue cheese dressing was thick and tasty. I was glad to see it was made of baby salad greens instead of iceberg lettuce. 

There's several tempting specialty pizzas on the menu, but it will be a challenge for me to venture beyond the incredible buffalo chicken!

I got my order as a take out. The interior was clean and looked like a typical very casual pizzeria. The cashier was friendly and made me feel welcome. I tried this place with a Groupon and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Breakfast here is wonderful. Best French toast you will ever eat! Breakfast pizza is awesome. Wait staff is great, too."}
{"text":"I just moved to Belmont. I tried another pizza place that was amazing. I was told by a few people this is the best pizza and sauce in town. I ordered by phone and was told my 12\" plain cheese pizza would be 30 minutes. So I showed up 45 minutes later. The girl at the register, who is also working the phone asked if I ordered it online? Asked what I ordered? Then while I'm watching. Her ring it up and put the order in right in front of me still charged me for the pizza. I asked for a side of sauce since I heard it was so good. Another 20 minutes go by after I see the cook put a freshly made cheese pizza in oven and out pops my pizza. No apology or anything. I get home open the box. My pizza is only partially cut and I didn't get even get that sauce. Terrible first impression."}
{"text":"Unless im out of town i will never eat pizza west of the city from anywhere but here.  Seriously good, only negative i can say is if you dine in the dining room gets real hot sometimes but this time if year it is no big deal."}
{"text":"I have eaten the pizza here a few times now and am a fan for sure. Definitely my type of pizza, good amount of cheese, light on the sauce, and greasy, with extra crunchy crust! I miss the pizza places of NY and this place fills that void for me down here."}
{"text":"Pizza is my thing all the time. This is some of the best I've ever had anywhere in the country."}
{"text":"Definitely the best NYC-style around!  Well worth a trip into this simple place.  Only one minor request...a better beer menu would be nice."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and friendly service. Doesn't look like much from the outside, but worth a stop."}
{"text":"Simonetti's has reevaluated their way of doing things.  I once complained of them skimping on toppings, etc., to save money.  Example:  if you were to get a pepperoni pizza, there'd only be a few pieces of pepperoni.  

This really bothered me, because the food coming out of Simonetti's is very good.  Fortunately, I went back to Simonetti's since I had written my first review, and fortunately, they no longer skimp on what they serve.  I hope they keep this up, as the food was always good - and I now consider their food a good value for my dollar.

As for the rest of my experience:  the menu is diverse; the food is authentic; the people here are nice, and the restaurant is always clean.  Portions are good too.  I now recommend Simonetti's."}
{"text":"Sorely disappointed in their Sicilian pizza.  They told me that since it took an hour to cook it that any toppings would be added after the fact.  Little did I know they would added canned tomatoes instead of fresh ones.  To me, this totally destroyed the pizza."}
{"text":"The best pizza on the West side of the Charlotte, whether you like NY style, Sicilian, or Margherita.  I've only tried their pizzas and their NY style is a 3.5/5.0; their Sicilian is a little better at about a 3.75/5.0; but if you have their maestro Jessie making pizzas that night; then give his Margherita pizza (or at least give two slices a try) - they are almost 5.0/5.0 every time.  

I almost exclusively order two Margherita slices double-cut each time I go there.  And their slices are huge - two slices are usually larger than one traditional medium pizza you'd get from any other place in the area.  I've only done carry-out, but the staff is wonderful and they will accommodate any requests, gripes, or suggestions you may have cheerfully and will work to improve their product.  This is truly an example of a well run, small family-owned business that listens to their customers."}
{"text":"I've only eaten their pizza once and it was a take out order.  The pizza was pretty good, but not mind blowing.  It's more of a New York style pizza crust, really long, thin slices.  We had a bit of a fiasco when trying to pay for the pizza.  When we called to place the order we asked the order taker if they accept the entertainment book's $5 off coupon and she said yes.  When we went to pick up the pizza they took one look at our coupon and said they wouldn't accept it.  This was quite frustrating to us since we specifically asked about that type of coupon.  The girl who took our phone order was even there and she just said that she didn't realize that was the type of coupon we were asking about.  After much debating back and forth the cashier had the owner step in.  He eventually agreed to honor our coupon but he wasn't happy about it.  I thought one of the well known rules of customer service is if you promise something to a customer you should follow through.  I guess Simonetti's missed that lesson.

While their pizza was ok, I'd rather go to Papa John's or Pizza Hut to avoid arguing with the manager over the price."}
{"text":"We can only speak to the pizza by the slice, but that was very good.  They have par-cooked pies that they then add whatever topping you want to, then heat them up.  Interesting approach we hadn't ever seen before.

Portion sizes are crazy big.  We each ordered two slices thinking they'd be, you know, human scaled.  But each turned out to be a quarter of a medium-sized pizza.  One each might have been enough.  Splitting a third between us surely would have been enough food give we'd been driving all day versus, say, running a marathon.

As it was, we were out of there, tax and tip, for $25 for dinner.  Not bad including two Peroni beers.  Now, if they just had a nice selection of local craft beers on tap ..."}
{"text":"Simonetti's offers up a good pizza option for the Belmont area. We normally take-out, but the last time I went I ate in. The waitstaff was nice but seemed a bit distracted and therefore slower than I would have hoped for. The combination of ingredients on the house special pizza is very good - sausage, tomato, spinach, ricotta. Yum! I have also tried their calzones. While they are tasty, I do wish they would add more garlic and italian spices to their ricotta cheese mixture."}
{"text":"Great food excellent service.  
Simple but right.  Low key atmosphere in a non descriptive shopping center.    A regular when we are visiting Charlotte for pizza and honest Italian pasta. 
Don't expect fancy but you won't be disappointed. 
Service staff and owners are genuinely friendly and willing to please."}
{"text":"Authentic New York pizza!! I highly recommend it. They have more than pizza...anything on the menu is awesome! The staff is very friendly as is the owner. There is plenty of seating to go around. They have a nice dining area if you wish to eat in. If not, the take out waiting area has seating."}
{"text":"This is suppose to be the best pizza in Belmont but I don't know. It is expensive and light on toppings. Lots of crust with out cheese or toppings. Have tried some other dishes and was not impressed either. To expensive for what it is an average pizza joint."}
{"text":"Thos restaurant is great if you want a cheap place to eat, their pizza lunch special is wonderful! Staff has always been alright. Sometimes we've been ignored for way longer than is appropriate during slow times, but they've never been rude or anything. The Alfredo was very greasy, but the angel hair was superb! Was interested that paninis and sandwiches are mostly meat and cheese, so if you're more of a veggie lover, take note. However, the salads were lovely, particularly the seasoning on the house vinaigrette. Love coming here. Perfect casual date night."}
{"text":"Just had amazing Prosciutto Pizza with Green Olives on half and Pineapple in the other.  Fantastic!  My favorite Pizza."}
{"text":"Exceptional Italian fare and ridiculously good desserts at family friendly prices. 

Food compares favorably to many more expensive talian dining establishments in Charlotte. Whether your choice take out or their  casual dining area, the service is attentive, personable, and almost instant. The food is brilliantly prepared and a delightful surprise for an unassuming restaurant in a strip mall.  They also have a small selection of pastas, olive oils, wines, and other items for sale in the pickup/takeout area,

You won't leave hungry or disappointed."}
{"text":"We actually went in to Simonetti's the other week, but all we saw was some cheese pizza sitting behind the glass, got scared and walked out and went to the familiar Taxco down the strip. i decided to venture in again on my own last week. 

They have a dry erase board featuring their specials and a full paper menu on the counter. i opted for a slice of pizza with just mushroom and buffalo chicken. Basically they take the slice of cheese, add what you want and throw it back in the oven. The amount of toppings was generous and while initially i wasn't a fan of either topping i chose, i found that i devoured the entire thing crust and all (i typically leave my crust). Paid like $4 and change for the huge slice and a drink. 

Glancing at the rest of the menu, the prices seemed high for the entrees and calzones based on the paper plate feel of the place. However, i'm guessing they would probably taste pretty darn good. 
 The dining room is tiny with maybe 8 small tables. 

 Every table seemed to know the owner on a first named basis (guessing he was the owner since he looks just like the cartoon in their logo). However, the service was outstanding. Very friendly and prompt on offering refills as they were out cleaning other tables. 

To answer my future wife's question, yes i think it will be a place i'll go to again."}
{"text":"You want italian food? You got italian food.  I'm a New Yorker and I say THIS is NY pizza.  They also make a great calzone.  Haven't tried the entrees yet but I will.  Friendly staff.  Reminds me of DaVinci's in Greenwich, CT back in the late 70s/80s.  That's the highest compliment from me!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Friendly service! Clean and has WINE! Great for families and dates  
I will definitely be a returning to try more things from the menu! 
Best pizza in North Carolina! 
I can't believe I've passed by it so much and never stopped in, I am so glad I stopped this time. 
I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"It seems like almost any local independent pizza place gets 5 bonus points just for not being Pizza Hut or Dominos. Simonetti's is no different.

The missus and I recently stopped by to try the place. I got two \"special slices\", while she got a \"Sicilian slice\". She really enjoyed her slice, which was thick and delicious.

My slices - which were the \"Meat Special\" tasted great. But they were SO PUNY (see picture). I've seen Simonetti's advertised as \"NY style pizza\", but I've been to NYC enough to know that two slices of pizza should be almost half of a large Pizza Hut pizza. So although the pizza tasted good, the meager slices were an incredible disappointment.

I probably won't go back, unless they start offering major \"2 for 1\" specials. With my GF a vegetarian and me a hardcore carnivore, the slices are too small to make a meal, and the whole pies too expensive to get two."}
{"text":"The food we got was great and good customer service, but we did go late at night when they where about to close."}
{"text":"Make a great choice and order a salad with Gorgonzola cheese dressing and a Supremo Pizza. Yum! This restaurant is great for families."}
{"text":"When we first moved to Belmont, I was very unconvinced by this place. We tried it once, weren't impressed and wrote it off. But we kept hearing everyone rave about it so we gave it another shot. It's a decent pizza if you want to get away from the chains. If it were in Charlotte, I'd give it 3 stars, but given our few pizza options in the neighborhood, this will do! We usually get the buffalo chicken pizza and the white pie, a little on the pricey side. Pick up only, no delivery."}
{"text":"Amazing local pizza. My husband and I are both huge pizza fans and this is great pizza for a great price. I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The food is very good, but I was not impressed with the dining experience. The waitress was polite and friendly, but she brought the food my father ordered well before she brought the pizza the rest of us were sharing. In fact, my father finished his dish about 10 minutes before we finally received the pizza, well after we were first seated.  When the pizza did arrive, it was much smaller than what we ordered. To make up for it they promised us extra slices, which also took a long time. While the food was good, it was not worth the waiting. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza ever.  Start with the Supremo.  We get Kalamata olives instead of green peppers.  The Italian dishes are good too.  The staff is friendly and ready with the refills.  Don't miss an opportunity to stop here.  If you can't, order takeout."}
{"text":"Hubby & I tried this place for the first time tonight. For a Sunday night, this place is hopping. Lots of children and babies, which is not my cup of tea but that has not effected the rating. 

We ordered a white pizza & regular pepperoni. White pizza was delicious and we would definitely order it again. Pepperoni was mediocre and a bit overcooked, but had that orange grease that hubby loves so much.

Service was good-we were the second table in the house upon arrival, but the place filled up and there were only two available tables by the time we left. Our server was hustling, but made sure to check on us, refill drinks, etc. She did spill my tea all over me, but handled it very well. Fortunately, I have been a server before and that did not affect the rating.

Overall, this place is a great small time pizza joint. If you have a family, you'll fit in great. If you aren't really family-friendly, maybe just try getting pizza to-go. We will eat here again if we are in Belmont & craving pizza but we won't go out of our way to visit Simonetti's."}
{"text":"While my husband and sons love this place, I keep struggling everytime we order.  Tonight, I decided to go with something simple, margherita pizza.  However, at Simonetti's I guess they make their margherita without any red sauce.  That was a first for me.  I received a pizza with a very wet dough, too much mozerella and a couple slivers of basil.  It was so wet and doughy that I ended up just throwing it in the trash.  Sorry Simonetti's, I'm done."}
{"text":"This was only our second pizza from Simonetti's since it came to Belmont several years back. Our first pizza left us with  the feeling that this owner wanted to make his profits by seeing just how small an amount of toppings could be put on a pizza. This might work sometimes if the taste is amazing, which wasn't the case.  We decided to give them one last try, and ordered my wife's favorite \"Marguerita pizza\".
What we got was the most tasteless piece of pizza I've ever had.  It was a sparse amount of fresh mozzarella with sliced Roma tomatoes on a thin flavorless \"water cracker like crust.  It had No BASIL, NO OLIVE OIL, NO SALT, NO OREGANO and NO FLAVOR.  Never again."}
{"text":"Th pizza is pretty good but the customer service sucks. The cashier is also the \"waiter\". Most people get up and take their empty cup back to cashier and as for a refill. I see this happening every time I come her. So why are you expecting a tip when you don't even come to take to check out your customers?!?! 
I like to order the pizza by th slice. They give you large slices."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, salads, and pasta. Friendly wait staff and owner. We love Simonettis!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great . But I just cant get past the poor service with so many people there. I was there  on 6/19. I was seated  then two other couples were seated after me. They received quick service , I just sat there with no server. After 10 minutes I left and they said thanks and have a good night."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our experience. The meal was extremely overpriced and below average.  Ordered cheese bread appetizer. My mistake not looking at the menu. I just ask waitress to bring what neighboring tables were having.  She ask would we like marinara and garlic. I said fine.  Didn't realize less than 1/2 cup marinara for our party of four was extra $1.00 in addition they charged another extra $1.00 for garlic.  Our large order of lasagna with meat sauce had less than tablespoon of meat and mozzarella only on top.  Mostly comprised of pasta and tomatoes. Another member of our party had angel hair pasta with Alfredo sauce.  Very bland no flavor.  We purchased takeout desserts from display counter.  After adding the 20% tip our entire meal was around $116.00 for four people. Maybe we should have just got a pizza. Will definitely will not go back. Too expensive for the poor quality of food."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Gaston County... again. You'll quickly find out why with a slice. I'm not much of a fan of some of their sandwiches. I have had better. However, for pizza, look no further. I know that whenever someone who doesn't typically eat pizza or even request to get pizza asks to specifically come here, that has to tell you something. Coke products, some NY style soda and some Italian beer can be purchased. Mr. Simonetti can often be found working the oven himself. The staff is amazing.

Located off of the Belmont Abbey exit of i-85 at Wilkinson - found in the shopping plaza behind McDonalds."}
{"text":"Drove 10 miles to try this place. Nice change of pace from the pizza chains. About as close to true NY style as you'll get around here. Locally owned."}
{"text":"I was in Gastonia an meet a friend for dinner here. This pizza place does not disappoint. This is a hole in the wall which is always the best finds :) they have calzones, salads but I came for pizza. They have a 12 inch or 16 we ordered the 16 an it was more than enough for 2 ppl.  We did half pepperoni an half ham/pineapple. The crust is very good light an airy. We also ordered the cheesy bread oh this is not that nasty little Caesars cheese bread. It was the same crust with fresh mozzarella cheese n sauce to dip mmmmm"}
{"text":"My favorite place for pizza   Fresh chewy crust  fresh toppings. My favorite is the veggie.  Good meatballs too.    No a fan of their white pizza but the red sauce is really good"}
{"text":"Just finished a quick lunch before a doctor appointment. Excellent pizza ! I had the plain 2 slice lunch special with drink. My son had the pepperoni pizza lunch special. Again, it was delicious. We sat outside. The staff was so attentive! They were very busy hosting a bus load of girls' lacrosse players from Tampa. Simonetti's rocks!"}
{"text":"New to Belmont so I wanted to check this place out. The reviews for this place didn't seem horrible so my family and I gave it a shot. I placed an order for what I believe they consider a \"large\" pepperoni with pineapples. The pizza itself looked decent until I noticed the large looked like a medium and there were BARELY any pineapples. Probably will give it another try but eh, I doubt it."}
{"text":"True Italian food! This place is amazing! We first moved to Belmont thinking we were going to be able to get a decent pizza, and we were absolutely wrong. Hands-down the best pizza in town. Not only that, but you can buy some of the same ingredients they use in their food right there in the restaurant. If you get a chance just give it a try, you will be absolutely convinced this is the place to be for good pizza."}
{"text":"Simonetti's is hands down the best Pizza in Belmont and I have been to all of the Pizza places in Belmont.  Their pizza ingredients are fresh and delicious and they will bend over backwards to please you.  The inside is too bright for my tastes but it is a great family place where they do have some wine and beer, which is a good thing.  They are very friendly there and strive to please.  Most of my Belmont friends prefer SImonetti's to any of the other pizza places in town, although Johnny B's is good too, and Demetrio's is a good third choice."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast! Everything is incredible you will not have an easy decision on the menu! You have to try it!"}
{"text":"Had a slice of cheese, very good. Ill update when I try more as I want to come back.. expectations are high. : )

Also Jim C complaining bout the size of slices??? 

Slices are $1.75 buddy get a clue and go back to Dominoes for your generic $5 pizza."}
