{"text":"Got breakfast here and it was incredibly inedible. The pancakes were so tough, I could not even cut them with a knife. The \"toast\" was a piece of bread with liquid oleo that had been slapped onto it with a brush right in the center of the bread. The dinners that I've had here are not any better. It is quite obvious all the food comes from a can or the freezer. The building is in good shape, but the wall decor is a bit depressing. The walls are covered with pictures of the town when it had been destroyed by a tornado. Not very chipper looking. The staff was very friendly, though and service was acceptable."}
{"text":"Stopped here at lunchtime for something different than the chains. Pleased by the cleanliness, good food and friendly people."}
{"text":"We were glad to find someplace to eat that had pretty good food, very attentive staff, and wine.  Not a great selection but I had their merlot and it as good.  Food was hot and served promptly."}
{"text":"Truckstop dining, with video gaming in separate area. Extensive 10 page menu, which you had better know because you are pushed to make a decision. There are specials as well. Ordered a turkey club came with beef barley soup, cheesecake, handcut french fries (which were surprisingly crisp) and we also ordered triple play hot melt sandwich. The turkey club claimed turkey, bacon lettuce tomato and Swiss. No mayo came on it or cheese. Mushy tomatoes. Considering that turkey is offered 12 other places within the menu it was the cheapest, cold-cut style used, not deli sliced as typically served in a club sandwich. Tomatoes are in season, so a mushy tomato could possibly mean not fresh. Served on old bread with no condiments except extra mayo (in a container) on the side. Soup claimed to be fresh but the meat was cubed hamburger type beef, looked pre-made. The hot sandwich was worse, described as a triple decker but had three different meats rolled to a single sandwich again on cheap wheat bread (reminded me of Walmart brand wheat). Plenty of food, but cheap in taste and quality, and a sandwich is pretty hard to make unappetizing, yet this was the case. Cheesecake had it going on until the topping gave off the all-too dessert ruining canny fruit taste, and although I had asked for cherry, I was given strawberry. Over all value considering portion, prices (moderate pricing fair portion) food quality (not as home-made as led to believe) service seems harried, friendly enough, checked/refilled/present, (actually the one redeeming factor) skip this place unless you don't have a choice) probably better off as a gaming, late night trucker food stop. Hold out for better."}
{"text":"Dont order the ribs!!! They reheated an old slab in the microwave and served them. But worst of all they were all fat and no meat!!! They did ofter to let me order something different but now I am paying for 2 meals plus im sure they would have done something to my food since I complained about it."}
{"text":"Huge menu. Breakfast is good, large portions. I recommend the skillets. French toast looks and sounds great if you want something sweeter. Can't go wrong with the Gyro or Greek Salad my fav's"}
{"text":"This honestly was not the best. We are from out of town and there isn't much to eat but this place. The steaks are waay over priced, especially for not even being that good. And what restaurant serves steaks with green beans and a lettuce leaf and tomato slice Not recommended, and probably not going again."}
{"text":"Our breakfast was Luke warm for as long as we wait it ! The couple that walked in after us got there drinks and there food before us ,must been regulars they are more imported!"}
{"text":"Family, friendly restaurant right off the interstate. I've come here about 4 years ago for dinner which was alright. We decided to try it for breakfast. It was around 9:40 when we went- it was empty. Poorly decorated, stained carpets, but other than that.. It was okay, or so I thought. I got the chopped steak (medium well) which came with 3 eggs (over easy), 2 toast, and American fries or hashbrown which I got the American fries. I was informed the American Fries were cubed- cut potatoes. Hubby got the biscuit with gravy and a plain crepe. Needless I say, I am disappointed.. The chopped steak was nothing but a hamburger patty. I ate 2 bites of everything then left. Gravy had no flavor.  Service was fast and waitress was friendly. I wanted to complain, but my hubby went to school with the girls there, so I kept my mouth shut and told myself I'd never be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I eat here at least four times a week. Breakfast, lunch and supper.  The soups are homemade daily.  Their hamburgers cannot be beat.  Family dining and very friendly.  Try it, you will like it."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant with very friendly people, good service, but poor quality food. French fries were cold. Food just seems very cheap and possibly pre-frozen. I would rank this as cafeteria quality food."}
{"text":"Awesome, we truck drive so we are tired of having fast or processed food.  The beef soup was out of this world, flavor.  Parking lot holds about six rigs, but you can clearly see if the lot is full when coming off the highway. So you can continue on easily.  We will eat here again. Our meals were wonderful, always love a little Mexican food."}
{"text":"Family diner just off the interstate 57,  good selection & value with 24hr breakfast.  A locals place."}
