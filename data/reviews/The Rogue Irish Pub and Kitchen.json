{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!!!!! I went with a bunch of girlfriends and was blown away by the food (ACTUALLY good food for you new transplants to Charlotte), drinks, atmosphere, and service. The owner is from Ireland and actually imported the special flour for the Irish bread (delicious)! We sampled a few different dishes and everything was fantastic: Onion soup, bread, salad...Did I mention the bread is to-die-for? Also, the drinks are fantastic. Get the frozen Irish coffee. It's like a frapucinno, but better, and with alcohol. Yay. The atmosphere is relaxed, friendly and warm with really nice staff and servers. This place rocks and we will definitely be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this little Irish bar yesterday for dinner and it did not disappoint. I ordered one of their fantastic cocktails (most of which are about $10) and ordered the fish and chips. In my opinion, these are the best fish and chips in Charlotte. You get three very large pieces of fish on top of a mountain of seasoned French fries. Food came out quick with no problem at all. I finished my night off with a hot honey toddy, which was perfection on a chilly night. The Irish coffee was also really good. Staff were extremely polite and friendly. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great drinks at affordable prices. Went with some friends the and split different apps all were good and the rogue salad was delicious! Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Great new place. Low key friendly place with good beers and nice service. Food was solid, nothing fancy but just well done pub food. Between the four of us, we got a burger, a couple shepherd's pie, and fish and chips. And everyone was happy with their choice.  This was the first time since we've moved to Charlotte 5 can years ago, where we went to a new place during their opening week and the service and food was done perfectly, and we'd be excited to go back there.   Hopefully, things will only get better. My only wish is that they start having a good trivia night."}
{"text":"I really want this place to figure it out!! I love Irish pubs, but this just isn't there quite yet. Food was good, but everything came out at different times, and the menu was small. The bar area is nice but the restaurant looks like when it was East Blvd Bar and Grill. The music was a weird mix of oldies and pop, think we heard brick house at one point. Some Irish music (new or old) would have been great. The management was wonderful and very accommodating, seemed to really enjoy interacting with the guests. I would try again, and still hope for a little more Ireland!"}
{"text":"Don't write many reviews but felt compelled to leave one for The Rogue. Came with some friends for Dinner one night and had a great experience. Got the Irish Onion Soup and the Reuben Sandwich and both were delicious. The service was especially excellent; the manager or owner (not sure which) was very much making sure everyone was having a satisfactory experience and got everything we needed. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and great food. The fish and chips are excellent! I was waiting for this restaurant to open solely to have a nearby spot where I could get fish and chips. This place definitely lived up to my expectations. I've also tried the rogue salad and onion soup which were both great.   The staff was very friendly and the owners also walk around and greet everyone which is nice.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service, awesome food; try the sliders and braised lamb nachos, you won't be disappointed. Looking forward for my next visit"}
{"text":"Was excited for Irish pub food (love a good boxty). Unfortunately, the food was edible but not good..."}
{"text":"Unlike most Irish pubs, it doesn't feel like it is trying really hard to be Irish. It feels more like a pub actually in Ireland which is definitely nice. Atmosphere was well done and so was the food. Would recommend the corned beef hash and Irish coffee."}
{"text":"Second visit today was as good as first.  Both times I asked if I could get the fish and chips during brunch when it wasn't on the menu.  Both times it was no problem.  Fish was perfect and fries very good too.  The sides with tartar, ketchup, and mashed peas worked as well.   Will definitely be back hopefully for some drinks in the evening."}
{"text":"I'm not sure this place has a chef. It's flavorless food that looks right but isn't good. The $14 hamburger was just ground beef with a piece of cheese.  Small and unremarkable. The signature shepherds pie needed seasoning. The heavy metal music overpowered what was a cool restaurant atmosphere. Nice beer selection. The appetizer and desert were good but not outstanding.   Doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Friend had the wings and said they were very good!  And I have heard from others that the food is very tasty.  I just could not allow myself to pay the prices on the menu.  Therefore I did not eat anything.  The beers however were delicious. $14 for a burger is too expensive and just not on par for the neighborhood.  Ill be back for beers though!"}
{"text":"First-time visit today for lunch. Rainy day, but parking was covered and easy. What a delightful surprise. Food as terrific. Wife had chicken pot pie. I had shepherd's pie. We shared and agreed both dishes were among the best of each that we have had in a long time. Chicken pot pie tasted so fresh, wonderful chunks of chicken and vegetables smothered in a wonderful creamy sauce covered by a delicious pastry.  Shepherds pie was delicious too. Lean meat, perfectly seasoned, covered with delicious mashed potatoes. Large serving, but I ate every bite. Service was pleasant and attentive. Only disappointment was lack of freshly brewed iced tea. This is the South. Don't give us that instant stuff from the bar soda spout. You wouldn't get that in Ireland. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a great new spot in Charlotte. Fantastic service and food that lives up to its category as a gadtropub. Highly recommend you try this place and definitely order the lamb sliders!"}
{"text":"Holy cow! I keep coming back because there are so many unique food and drink options. I've been there for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and have yet to be disappointed. The mac n cheese, boxty, the rogue salad, and hot irish coffee are a few of my favorites. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for dinner and loved the vibe of this place. I checked out the menu before I came in so I'd have an idea of what to order.   I ordered the shepherd's pie and shared a side/app of macaroni and cheese and the crab dip.   The mac and cheese was very good. I'm a sucker for cheddar and fontina cheeses...add a little bacon to that and you definitely have a winner!   The crab dip was good too - I'd recommend asking for a little extra baguette for dipping.   The shepherd's pie was good - it arrived to the table pipping hot and the had a beautiful presentation. This was actually my first time having this dish so I didn't know what to expect. It was different, but I enjoyed it. If you like lamb then you will really enjoy this dish.   There are a few other dishes that I'd like to try, so I'm sure I'll visit them again."}
{"text":"Came here to grab some grub.  Had their Guinness BBQ wings well done which were very tasty leaving us wanting more.  Also had the Reuben which was good but could have had a little more meat to it.  It came with fries - a mountain of fries which were actually very good fries.  They were thick and well cooked so they were still crispy on the outside.  My friend had the lamb shank and said it was very good as well."}
{"text":"Love the decor and the bailey's Irish coffee is the best I ever had. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Found this place while walking around Dilworth on a brisk day in November. Ordered the broccoli soup and my life has been changed. Best broccoli soup I have ever had. They have frozen Irish coffee for $5 all day every day. It is strong but that's they way I like it. Also, if your there for brunch, get a side of sourdough toast. It is to die for, especially because they serve it with Kerrygold butter which is the best Irish butter. Prices are very reasonable. Soup and Irish coffee cost me $10. I will absolutely be back, probably later this week."}
{"text":"The rogue not only has awesome food, their staff is top notch.  A group of us recently had a birthday party here. The management and service team all jumped up to help us set up and were actually glad to be doing so.  We ended up needing another table to add on to ours- no problem! I believe they work on a team service structure as we had many smiling faces helping throughout our meal.      We all had a variety of different dishes from their brunch menu. I had the rogue salad with chicken and that was perfect as I wasn't too hungry.  The scrambled egg dish was highly raved about.  The coffee cake French toast is to die for. (I had it last time I was there). The bananas they put on are very fresh and add to the awesome flavor.  The burger was a hit. Finally, the ceviche was excellent. We were all impressed with the generosity of the serving.  I lied....one more thing- the frozen Irish coffee is a MUST!!!!!! Plus, they have  it's a good little kick to them :)   Highly recommend for a place to go on a date, bring a big group or to casually watch a  game.  Thanks for making our friends birthday memorable. We will surly be back....soon!"}
{"text":"Brunch awesome! The best part is that the menu has both lunch sandwiches and breakfast, unlike many places where brunch really means breakfast. Great BLT, great Ruben, great French Toast, great place"}
{"text":"I was introduced to The Rogue on a date. We went here to watch March Madness and have been going back since. The food is delicious and is a great place to grab a pint. The chicken pot pie is incredible. The flaky top covers a rich chicken filling that is hearty and creamy. The shepherds pie was great and very filling. The lamb had amazing flavor and was tender. We were won over by the Bailey's Irish cheesecake, the cheesecake is fluffy with a hint of Bailey's and the chocolate ganache is perfectly rich. The ice cream sammie is also great and the cookies are homemade. If you need a after dinner coffee the Irish coffee is so yummy. It is a blended beverage that will brighten your spirit.   The owner and staff are fun and personable. They make sure their customers are taken care of and have everything they need. The Rogue's bar is comfy and plays the current sports events. In the dining area there is a projection TV so you don't miss the action. My favorite part is the music has been on point and not too loud to enjoy your friends and conversation."}
{"text":"Living within walking distance, I was really excited to see this place open up in the old EBBG location! Service is swift and genuine and drinks are reasonably priced. There are a few good beer choices on draft but I  would love to see some more local brews and IPA's (my personal fave). I've only had one meal here and while I don't eat fish & chips often ... I will probably indulge a little more frequently now that this little spot serves up the real deal. The only negative was the side order of roasted cauliflower ... no flavor and barely \"roasted\" - don't be afraid to let that veggie hang out in the oven a little longer! Otherwise, a yummy meal and a great bar. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner at the Rogue tonight and I can honestly say it was one of the best dinners we had in quite some time. To start there are many so called  \"Irish\" bars that can't pour a back and tan. The Rogue can! And it only got better from there. Mussels were some of the best we ever had. Yum! We had the fish and chips which were terrific. Fish was light and delicious, fries were fantastic. Finished it off with bread pudding and ice cream. All I can say is Wow! Our server Sierra and owner Sam could not have been nicer. Do yourself a favor. GO THERE!"}
{"text":"We don't get out of the house w/o the kids often, so when we do, we always try to hit the best spots. Tonight did not disappoint. Sam took great care of us and made great suggestions. The lamb shank was excellent as was the pot pie. We finished up with the best bread pudding I've had in Charlotte. The Irish coffee wasn't bad at all. If you're in the area, you should definitely get after it."}
{"text":"This is a clean and new establishment. Solid footrail under the bar. Brilliant natural sunlight.  All drinks here are named after men, except for Hot Irish Coffee and The Boxer, which could be unisex.  The Pancho Villa that was poured before me was the best margarita representation I had all day. (Adding soda to a Margarita-style beverage is a personal preference. Barkeeps often look at me funny when I request soda in my margarita. Not here.)  Yet $6 for a Yuengling?"}
{"text":"First thought, how in the world will I find this place? East Blvd isn't incredibly well lit and the signs are black and surrounded by pathway coverings. If you aren't looking hard, it's easy to miss. There seems to be plenty of parking around and I had no trouble finding a spot.  Once inside, it's fairly dark and while each table had a candle, it wasn't quite the ambiance of a candlelit evening. The restaurant was very loud and though I appreciated a corner spot away from too much activity, our table was inconveniently spaced among the surrounding tables but still a bit more private.  The beverage menu has a little bit of everything. A few  intriguing cocktails, some local craft beers and a few styles of wine. Would have loved a description of the different craft beers but can't win them all. I enjoyed an OMB Copper. It's a staple for me when I'm craving something local. I wanted to try the chicken pot pie and the fish n chips, so my best friend ordered the pie and we shared our selections. The fish n chips is served with 'mushy peas' and frankly, any food with 'mush' in the description, isn't for me. I subbed for broccoli which could have been better. It was right on the edge of cooked and raw. Not great. The fried fish and pub fries really took the stage though. Well seasoned pub fries aside some crisp cod, really hit the spot. I wish the fries had been a little warmer but no actual complaint there.  The chicken pot pie was well proportioned and seemed to be a must have since everyone in the restaurant had at least one at their table. The crust was flakey, creamy insides were flavorful, chicken in bite sized pieces....quality stuff. Loved the presentation on a wooden platter with entree and side of soda bread.  Service wasn't out of this world but for a pub, I was just glad we weren't forgotten. The bill was reasonable. Under $50 for two people, each with a drink and entree. Not bad.  Would go here again just for the pub fries but don't make the trip to Uptown just for a side dish. Three stars, mostly for the fries."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I have been wanting to try this place for awhile. We went around lunch time on a Friday. There was only one table with customers, but hey we got a good seat next to the garage window and it was a beautiful sunny day. We split the mac and cheese and if you like creamy, this is it! Heavenly, and so delicious. I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie and boy was it worth it! My dad ordered the Fish and chips and they were absolutely fantastic. From the customer service to the food, I will definitely be coming back. We were too full to order the apple pie, but we will be back so we can make room next time! Thank you for a great first time experience!"}
{"text":"In addition to having excellent food (we had the fish and chips and lamb sliders), the customer service and attention to detail are terrific. Both items are probably the best we've had. Even the sauces that accompanied each dish were evidence in the care they take in everything.   The spicy strawberry margarita is to die for.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ok, we are sitting here for the Panthers game, 12/10/17.  We walked in the bar area and it was somewhat busy. The other side not so much. The staff acted like we were invisible, so we ordered from the bar but we are sitting in the service area. The bud light was very warm and No Cold Glasses. The  atmosphere is boring and cold. Damn wish my beer was!!  We miss Franks East Blvd...:( We live around the corner hope this place gets better! The brunch menu is all you can order from until 3 PM."}
{"text":"Best Irish Pub in Charlotte.  Had a wonderful dinner and great drinks.  The beef stew special was amazing and the bread pudding desert is one of the best deserts to have in Charlotte! Definitely a must visit for those that like the \"Irish Pub\" feel too. Service was first class as well!"}
{"text":"Epic place for a night out drinking or a hearty irish meal. They have the staples; corn beef hash breakfast, shepard's pie, brown soda bread with kerrygold butter... nom! The food is delicious and the portions are good for what you pay. They have a bunch of great beers on tap and other yummy drinks and cocktails to order. Indoor/outdoor seating and it's right uptown; what more could you ask for! The staff is really cool and friendly as well.  If going for a night out, it gets packed and loud, but it has the feel of an authentic Irish pub. Dimmed lights, drinks flowing and good times all around. If you haven't been, check it out. Hubs and I are definitely fans!"}
{"text":"I have stopped in twice now during the week after work for drinks. Both times the place was lively but not too crowded. The hot and frozen Irish coffee will definitely keep me coming back. Bartenders are friendly and attentive. I also thought the prices were very good, especially for the Dilworth area."}
{"text":"When I first heard an Irish Pub was coming to Dilworth, my initial thought was bland fish and potatoes. The Rouge totally proved me wrong.  The food is great and the weekend brunch is fantastic.  The home fries are the best in Charlotte (and we eat out A LOT).  The salads, burgers and wings are excellent as well.  The service is warm and friendly.  The decor is what I consider a modern twist on an Irish Pub - Edison lights, dark wood mixed with industrial decor.  The Rogue is such a great addition to Dilworth!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot. Irish coffee is great and their brunch menu does not disappoint. The service is awesome. Sit at the bar if you can and Shannon will make you the best mimosa with a smile. Definitely a great addition to the Dilworth area!"}
{"text":"I visited The Rogue on a Saturday night with my boyfriend and another buddy. We were excited to try a new spot and see what else is popping up around the Dilworth area. We were pleasantly surprised!   We ordered a few beers, two veggie panini (one with the side of fries, the other with a substitute side salad) sandwiches and an onion soup. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented. The sandwiches had an ideal amount of goat cheese and pesto - they weren't dripping or oozing with grease.  Our waitress was attentive and the owner even stopped by to hear feedback. There are several TVs in the bar and dining space, which means easy access to game viewing.   The owner brought our table Irish Coffees (on the house) after our dinner. It was a sweet gesture and the night cap wasn't overly sweet.   I look forward to trying their brunch menu next! The warm, inviting atmosphere really makes this spot feel cozy. It is ideal for an unstuffy get together with friends."}
{"text":"Amazing food , good service and unique atmosphere. Came in on Saturday morning for brunch and the eggs Benedict was better than most I have had. For sure want to check out the dinner menu soon and see how busy it gets during the summer since they have these cool garage doors that open up to the street. Only complaint about the place I guess is the theme is a little odd. It's an Irish Bar but very modern and the music was American pop music."}
{"text":"Awesome service and even better food! Going back for my birthday! Definitely worth a try/visit! $6 frozen Irish coffees(perfect for this warm weather). If you're able to make it for brunch definitely get the Irish breakfast! Best I've had in charlotte!"}
{"text":"Make no mistake about it. This is a sports bar with better than average sports bar food. And with an Irish theme that seems half hearted at best.   The Guy Fawkes cocktail was really good. The Irish onion soup had a good flavor and less sodium than many French onion soups (also less cheese and a soda bread which had a looser  texture compared to French bread).   The fish and chips...  Can we talk?  While the batter, overall flavor and texture of the fish was all great it was way too salty. And the chips were strange. Not really the traditional fries associated with fish and chips. They were regular fries heavily garnished with parsley and grated cheese. Then there was the side of mushy peas. They were served in the same metal containers the tartar saucy and ketchup were served in. As if the peas are a garnish rather than a side. But worse, they were served cooler than room temperature.  Disappointing.   We came toward the end of a big football game and the place had great energy. The servers were prompt and friendly. Good potential here, but some focus on the food is warranted to retain the enthusiastic rating it currently has."}
{"text":"Some friends and I made our way to Rogue after a couple of beers next door. My SO and I shared the BLT. I've had several disappointing BLTs from restaurants, but I was really sad that I only got half of this one! The fries were great too. The group shared the boxty, mac and cheese, and roasted cauliflower. Everything was delicious!  The mac and cheese was super creamy and full of flavor. Service was great as well. I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I don't wanna exaggerate, but this was perhaps the slowest service I've ever had. The fella and I stopped in for Sunday brunch a few minutes after they opened at 10:00, and we didn't leave until 11:30... and it wasn't because we were trying to be leisurely. I sat with an empty coffee mug for a good 20 minutes before I finally flagged down our waiter. He also had zero personality, talked so fast and low we couldn't understand him, and didn't check on us one single time.  Parking in the attached deck was easy that time of day. The inside looks great (definitely more fancy than when it was East Blvd Bar & Grill), and the food was really tasty. For brunch, the fella and I split the Irish donuts, which were a little hard for my taste, but maybe that's how Irish donuts are? He got the burger, and I got the corned beef hash - both were great. The corned beef had a really good, fresh flavor to it, and his fries were seasoned perfectly. Even my decaf coffee was good, which is rare for decaf.  Everything else was pretty great, but the service put such a damper on our experience that I had to knock off two stars. I'll definitely be back to try again - it looked like the people who sat at the bar were getting much better service, so maybe that's the trick."}
{"text":"Came here on New Year's day around 10 or 11 am. The food was decent (omelette and potatoes) but nothing I'd return for specifically.  I ordered a peach bellini - it took quite a while to be delivered (only 6 tables in the whole restaurant and 2-3 in our server's section) and after a few sips, told the waitress it tasted like just champagne.  She said they were out of peach and had to use schnapps.  Would've been nice to know.  She hardly ever checked on the table, so when we needed coffee refills, orsalsa for our omelettes, it was too late and our food would've been cold. Someone literally had to get up from the table and find her. And there was a hair or something fuzzy in a drink. I may actually go back for lunch or dinner because I think service was the main issue that day."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Great food and great service!  The onion soup is phenomenal. And I highly suggest trying the brown bread. I had to order seconds! The rogue salad is the perfect combination with the goat cheese and dressing! The toffee dessert was worth stopping by for all on its own.   For a night out, get the iced Irish coffee, it's way better than it sounds."}
{"text":"I just got done eating and drinking at this place spent $50 they where out of well vodka after the manager talked me up about it being a cheap $5. I said what ths heck and ordered it and the bartender pored me a drink and said $7 i asked what about $5 we are out he said. His manager was so mean to hime and said just give the jim bean for $5 instead of $7 nd went on a rampage over $2.00. Look food is ok drinks are over priced. If you want cheap drinks and chill not so uptight people go to bakersfield next door with $3 shots and beers every day. The rogue has a cute atmosphere but management is cut throght to the employees which spills out unto the customers making for an ubcomfortable and ill advised night out."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere with great cocktails and food. Have had the chicken pot pie and the corned beef hash and both are delicious! Also, Irish coffee is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place really exceeded our expectations. My husband has been searching for an amazing fish and chips place since we moved here and we found it!! Incredible breading and quality fish - THE BEST IN CLT. Fish and chips wasn't even on the menu because we were here during brunch but they made them for us anyway! The pub fries were delicious and I loved the veggie sandwich. They went above and beyond knowing it was my husband's birthday and the bread pudding was delicious. The service was excellent. Attentive and kind. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in today for a late lunch.  Sat at the bar, and like others, Thank you for hooks under the bar!    Ordered two beers, a Reuben sandwich and a cup of the soup of the day, which was lobster bisque.  The sandwich was one of the best Reubens we've ever had, piled high with corned beef and kraut, lightly toasted, accompanied by a plateful of French fries, also delicious.  I would probably dock this one star for the lobster bisque, which was very thin with only a few tiny pieces of lobster, but the service was great, cool ambiance, and the super Reuben made up for it.  We can't wait to go back and try more from the menu."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon The Rogue last Friday night and was not disappointed. It had been on my Brunch-to-visit list, but instead I found myself here for dinner. Two words -- the Reuben. Out of this world DELICIOUS! I will be back for that alone. Great music on a Friday night, nice and cozy, good selection of beers and drinks. I loved it!"}
{"text":"When I think Irish Pub, I picture a bunch of happy drunk people singing and clinking their beers together.  That's definitely NOT what you're going to get at The Rogue.  If I had a more accurate description for this place, it would be an \"Irish Gastropub\".  Here's why...  The menu is simple, elevated and reasonably priced.  You have a few traditional dishes from the other side of the pond, like Onion Soup, Shepherd's Pie and Fish & Chips.  Then you have some other American favorites, like wings, a burger and mac & cheese.  I had the Broccoli Soup Special (delicious), Rogue Salad (loved the freshness of the dressing, apples and walnuts) and Lamb Sliders (good, but would have liked a little more of a kick of flavor).  I recommend them all, and I'll be in next time for the burger (heard good things!).  The drinks are great.  So you've got your Irish Coffee and your Guinness, but you also have a whole slew of great cocktail, beer and wine choices.  I had the Pancho Villa (basically a margarita), but I've heard good things about the Rasputin.  Key interest...the Frozen Irish Coffee (whaaaattttt????).  The decor is so cozy.  Think Edison lights with dark paint colors and woodwork.  So industrial chic.  The waitstaff has a casual, flannel shirt look that just adds to the comfortable atmosphere.  Love it.  I'm beyond excited to have another awesome restaurant pop up in Dilworth!  This is truly an awesome addition to the East Blvd block, and I can definitely see myself becoming a regular here at The Rogue."}
{"text":"I recently dined here for lunch during the week with a friend. It was very quiet with only 2-3 other parties in the restaurant. We tired the crab dip appetizer to start. It was ok, but not great. I'm curious to know if it's freshly made. I also assumed it would come out piping hot since our waitress warned us about the hot dish it was served in when she sat it down, but it was just barely warm. We ordered the shepherds pie and Irish BLT planning to share both. The shepherds pie was average, but the BLT was great. The best part of our meal. Fries were also just ok. I think some things are slightly lacking seasoning/ salt. Ie: the fries and mashed potatoes on the SP."}
{"text":"I love local places, and I especially love local places with excellent food. This place is exactly that. After trying most of their cocktails, I have yet to be disappointed with any of them. As for their food--absolutely incredible. Their fish and chips is a serious favorite, as well as their Ruben. I think a lot of their food looks even better in person than the pictures they post--the pictures simply don't do it justice. And their fries are absolutely incredible. I also had the pleasure of trying their scallops one night, which was on special. Seriously exceeded my expectations. My only complaint is that I wish I had a bigger stomach so I could have eaten more! This place has become one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I came here expecting a nice dinner and some unique food options. I ordered a soup and salad but the salad flavors didn't mix well, strawberries and ham is an odd combination for me. On top of that, my friend had her water glass refilled with what tasted like soap/bleach thy wasn't rinsed from the pitcher. Not sure if it was related or not, but considering that this was the only thing I ate this day, I got food poisoning and vomited from 12am-6am."}
{"text":"Amazing Food!!! Best Fish and Chips!  The fries are to die for! The Shepard's pie was amazing. Crab dip was amazing!"}
{"text":"Such great food!! The ambiance is to die for and whoever designed the menus did an amazing job. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Great environment. Got drinks with some my friends one night. Nice drink menu. Next time I'll try some food."}
{"text":"I believe my wife and I have been in five times in the last month. Each time we get something else, and each time it's great. Some might view The Rogue as a pub that serves food. That's fine, but we see it as a restaurant with a great pub side.   The shepherd's pie, chicken pot pie, and especially the lamb shank are divine. The lamb came with mashed potatoes and incredible red cabbage, with a bit of vinegar. I couldn't get enough. The fish and chips are not over-breaded or greasy, and both are terrific.   Another time we had their fish special. We thoroughly enjoyed it.   The bread pudding dessert might be our second favorite we've ever had, after the ones at Bistro La Bon.   They have an eclectic selection of cocktails, which we look forward to trying. We've loved what we've had, but how can you go wrong with a pint of Guinness?  We live nearby, and thus are so excited to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new Irish spot to continue my journey around Charlotte to try all of the reubens in the city. Sadly, this reuben just didn't quite live up. The corned beef was tough - a combination of being overcooked and too fatty. The kraut was clearly made in house, but it didn't add that tart pickled flavor you'd expect. The rest of the reuben was OK, but overall it was just a mediocre reuben.  On the other side (quite literally), the fries were fantastic. I'd be interested to try something else the restaurant had to offer since the fries were so great, but I'd definitely steer clear of the reuben."}
{"text":"This is a place with good food.  Had the lamb sliders and I MUST say this was the best lamb slider I had in the Q City. Also had the wings for the Guinness barbecue  I pass on the Buffalo ... they taste just like hot sauce Also had the pub fries another great items.  The services needs some help and personality to it. If you not by the bar than you gonna wait for a while. Also the food just the starters took a long time to come.   The food made up for it tho so it's a win win for me today."}
{"text":"Great food. Went here for brunch. Great service . Nice set up well done . Wings and fries very good. Omelette very good not over cook or dry very taste . Servers were very Attentive and positive"}
{"text":"Came for brunch and have decided I need to come  back for lunch/dinner too!  I had the traditional Irish breakfast, which I very much enjoyed.  Great place to watch a game and they had soccer on for all of those soccer fans out their who want to watch some EPL while you eat brunch on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Discovered this gem searching for restaurants in a specific area.  Has a very cool vibe to it.  The food was awesome.  Crab dip and chicken pot pie as recommended by other users was so delicious!  They have daily drink specials as well.  Would definitely recommend a visit."}
{"text":"This is a cool new place to have dinner and drinks.  It's in a good location, right off East Blvd.  There is a convenient parking garage that's free.  The space is open and divided into a restaurant-ish section and the bar.  There are TVs throughout.  I saw a few people say it's like a sports bar, but I didn't get that feel.  It's a very modern, clean, up to date vibe.    The service was ok.  The waitress was nice, not 100% attentive, but decent.  There were no mention of refills for our waters, but oh well.  The food is good.  Everything seemed to be really fresh and came out hot.  The crab dip is an excellent appetizer.  The mac and cheese is also really delicious, I would like if it came as a side option. I ordered the Shepard's Pie against my better judgment and here's why-I hate lamb!  I know, stupid idea.  I thought maybe I'd give it a try.  The pie was beautiful and made to perfection.  I did not like the lamb in it and that's my fault and just my opinion.  If you enjoy lamb, by all means...you will enjoy this dish.  The soda bread is dense, but unique and comes with a soft butter.  I would love to come back again and try something different for sure!."}
{"text":"Love this place - my husband and I can be found here most weekends. The staff is friendly and welcoming, and I'll echo what many have said, that the food here is far more elevated than your typical pub food. My favorites are the chicken pot pie (the pastry on top is amazing) and the trout, and the bread pudding is next level if you're in the mood for dessert.   Pro tip: if the lower lot is full in the free parking deck, go out the back and to the left like you're heading to Scott avenue to access the 2nd level entrance."}
{"text":"Meh - it was just okay. There are Irish pub places in CLT that are (in my opinion) much better.   We started with the Crab Dip, which wasn't necessarily bad - it's that it was more of a spinach artichoke dip than the advertised crab dip. We found very, very little crab in it but a ton of spinach and artichoke. For our meals - my husband got the shepherds pie (which he liked) and I got the fish and chips. We were both super underwhelmed by my meal. I could taste the Parmesan on the fries but none of the herbs. They were also pretty soggy. I maybe ate five fries and left the rest. The fish was decent. Not great but not terrible. I left a good bit of it on the plate.   Was this place bad? No. I would say it's just okay and, honestly, there are so many good places in CLT that I don't see any reason we'd go back to a place that we weren't super impressed with."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight at The Rogue.  Everything delicious and atmosphere fun.  Worth the trip from Birmingham."}
{"text":"When I got in town I wanted to drink a Guinness so I looked up closed by places that served it. This place popped up and it was under the \"new and hot\" category. As soon as I walked in, I was acknowledged by the bar tender and gave me a menu, some locals started talking to me and I mentioned the Guinness and boom there it was without me even ordering it... ears good you must have bartender lol this place is pretty loud. I wasn't very hungry but the mac and cheese sounded good to me so I order it and added the bacon. OMG! So creamy, so yummy! I couldn't wait so I started eating before I took the picture ha! They had good fries too as the kitchen made an extra order and the bar tender gave it to the locals and I to share if we wanted them. They have different beers on draft, Wells and wine. Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"I want this place to succeed, and it has great potential, but there's more to do here. I think the menu is kind of limited and the food was OK, but didn't command the prices on the menu.  If you compare it with Lebowski's or Ed's Tavern, then it suffers in comparison.    Sleek decor and efficient service, but I was hoping for more variety on the menu and better value for the money."}
{"text":"Perfect Sunday brunch (corned beef hash). Aren't feeling so hot from last night?  This (and maybe a Bloody Mary) will do the trick.   Great neighborhood spot. Staff has been super friendly and are genuinely trying to make this a great place. Give it a shot!!  Or take a shot. Both sound good."}
{"text":"My wife and I always try a new place/restaurant on Sunday's. It has become a sort of tradition for us. When going on Yelp I was looking around for a nice brunch/lunch spot in Charlotte. I came over the rogue Irish pub. I love Irish pubs and Simone that has spent time in Ireland I was looking forward to the cuisine and experience. The reason that I gave this review three stars was simply because of the service. When we arrived we weren't greeted immediately, it took some time for someone to find us. Secondly, our waitress didn't seem to be really accommodating either. The food however was tremendous and probably the closest to Irish breakfast you will get in Charlotte.. very well done."}
{"text":"The Rogue is a very nice addition to Dilworth. Not your typical styled Irish pub; it has a clean bright airy feel with a super bar, high top tables, regular tables and booths. They have a full bar with decent selection of beers on tap, by the bottle and wine.   The menu is excellent; we made two trips so got a selection of the offerings. The lamb sliders and boxty off the brunch menu were both excellent. The crab & spinach dip maybe one of the best in Charlotte with a nice amount of real crab. The burger and fish & chips are both tasty. The pub fries are probably my favorite. Oh, my Guinness was expertly poured! Kudos!  A nice touch is both coat hooks and power sockets under the bar. In fact there are plenty of power outlets and USB ports throughout the restaurant."}
{"text":"Best new spot on east boulevard. Me and my friends have been coming in on Sundays the last few weeks now and each time is better than the last. Usually we sit at the bar and have a few Irish (frozen) coffees and they are amazing every time. Shannon has been our bartender every time and she is great. She is funny and always keeps us laughing. I think the managers name is Jackie? He always stops by to make sure everything is going well. If you want a great not over priced brunch I would say this is your spot."}
{"text":"Wow. Talk about bad service. I walked in and sat at the bar for over 5 mins before anyone even acknowledged my existence and when they finally came up and greeted me they wouldn't even take my drink order. The guy just dropped off a menu and left. It's 7:20 on a Thursday night and that place had people in it but it wasn't busy. I had to walk out. I came here based on the yelp reviews but I left angry and disappointed. I wanted some good Irish food and a Guinness. Looks like I'll be heading somewhere else."}
{"text":"Checked out Rogue for Saturday Brunch.  I know it was their 2nd weekend of \"official Brunch\" but I had been itching to scope out the space and see what they had to offer East Blvd.  I know there's a certain expectations to meet when you call a place an Irish Pub, but I think Rogue distinguishes itself in its own way... and also pays attention to the neighborhood it is becoming part of (Dilworth).  Started with frozen Irish coffees (they offer them hot as well if you are curious).  I worked out that morning so I was a pig and ordered an appetizer (to share, but not really) of deviled eggs and went with the coffeecake french toast.  The food did take a while to get to the table, but it was worth the wait!  Everything is pretty streamlined inside, clean lines, and very fitting for a restaurant in the Dilworth area.  It was nice to see booth set ups instead of a great big open space.  The menu matches their appearance in that it offers a number of options, but not totally overwhelming.  I liked that their cocktail menu is extensive ;).    Staff were super friendly... I know they were still figuring things out when I noticed our server was different (4 different folks) but maybe they do it \"team style\" here for the time being.  But everything was excellent.  I will definitely hope this place sticks around.  I'll have to come back on a regular night to try their menu vs. brunch."}
{"text":"Relaxing and enjoyable visit overall. Cool atmosphere and comfortable seating. I bet this place will be packed in the spring too when they open those plexiglass garage doors. Food was pretty tasty and gets credit for looking good too. The drinks were great. Well made and priced right. We will be back."}
