{"text":"The Jolly Roger will always hold a place in my heart.  This was my dad's favorite pizza place, and I have a lot of fond memories of eating here with him.  I was very sad to see it closed, but I'm holding out hope that it will one day reopen.  The thin cracker crust pizza's were absolutely amazing, and I loved them so much, that I never tried anything else."}
{"text":"Closed.  Was very marginal its last few years.  Poor service, even the thin-crust pizzas, which were the only things worth eating, started to slide badly."}
{"text":"Awful place. Both food and ambience (what ambience? It's more like an old age home). I'm not surprised that they're closed."}
