{"text":"When I was looking for the menu online, most of the information out there was out of date. The prices have gone up $2-3.

Spicy pork neck tacos ($10 for 2 tacos)
I liked the amount of meat and cabbage in the tacos.

Spicy pork buns ($9) - 1 burger cut into quarters
I liked that the buns were soft. We tasted the same spicy sauce in the tacos as the tacos. It was good but didn't jump out at me.

Soo yook - 48-hour braised beef ($12)
I'd skip this one

\"Galbi ssäm\" set - short rib ($20)
I liked the galbi. Flavourful and not too much fat (I usually leave the fat behind).

Service
Our server could've been more friendly/pleasant. She wasn't rude but didn't appear very welcoming either. Maybe that's the casual vibe they're going for?

Reservations
They do take reservations, but when we arrived it didn't seem like we needed one on a Tuesday night around 7:45pm. I used OpenTable anyway to get points."}
{"text":"pretty bad service and food. really ugly and rude waitresses, bad atmosphere..."}
{"text":"So I've been wrestling with this review.  How to you balance AMAZING food with some of the WORST and RUDEST service I've ever received to date?

Swish was a cool and intimate restaurant , a great place to meet up with a group of friends.  The food, where to start, it was incredible. The pork buns, the braised beef special, the spicy tempura prawns, lobster bi bim bap and the kimchi, it was beyond fantastic! 

The downside, at what point does all that great food make up for spending a half hour getting the waitress over to order drinks, then to have her come over a half hour later and announce \"we close the kitchen at 10:30, are you gonna order?\" It was 9:10 and we had been trying to flag her down for some time. At that point there was only one other table in the place and we had some questions about the menu, as we had newbies to Korean food with us. The level of annoyance and impatience displayed was incredible. When our food finally arrived, it was the cue for our servers to go about their business in an otherwise empty restauran and forget all about us. The pleasure of a 20% autograt for a chick who we had to walk over to to order a second round of drinks was the icing on the cake.  I have no problem giving a tip, but it's based on service and in this case, that was definitely lacking. 

No matter how good your food is and how trendy you think you are, treating your customers like crap is a sure way to ensure that you have 12 people who will never be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Fun place! Great vibe! I love a little place with helpful, friendly, staff that plays awesome music. The hot buns were amazing, the meat was so tender. Try the short ribs, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Like others have said, if you're looking for traditional Korean fare, this isn't the place for you. If that's what you're looking for, then hit any of the restaurants on Bloor St. or on Yonge St.

That said, if you're looking for fresh, tasty and unique but still VERY Korean food with a bit of funk to it ... this is the place. I've walked by this place over 50 times since I live (& work) about 5 minutes from them but I was never keen on trying it. However, we had some out of town guests that were keen on trying Korean so we checked it out. What an experience! It's your mom's Korean cooking but just a lot more refined and a lot more visually appealing. The seafood crepe (hae mul pajon) was phenomenal. They even offer a mahkolee sangria ... not for everyone but definitely livens up a normally difficult drink.

Service was good. I think they might have been a bit overwhelmed by the amount of food we kept ordering after the fact because of how good we realized it was. And the copious amount of soju cocktails that we consumed.

And like others have said ... it's a bit pricier than the places on Bloor or Yonge but I wasn't afraid of going to the washroom and touching anything because it's not your traditional / typical Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"I agree with most. Food was great - service was bad. Being served by a waiter in a tank top is disturbing. I don't like seeing underarm hair with my fish. There was no personality to any of the staff. The music was also way too loud. Conversation was impossible. 

the food was incredible though so if they can figure out the rest, this could be a top rated place in TO. Enforced gratuity is unacceptable if there is not a large party. 

I like the Kim-chi tofu."}
{"text":"I'm not that familiar with Korean food but came her for lunch.  I thought it was pretty good, the food was tasty, the restaurant looked good and I thought the service was good.

We started with the kimchi trio, which my lunch companion told me would have been free anywhere else.  Regardless, I had never had kimchi before and I liked it.  We also ordered the lettuce wrapped beef and I liked that a lot.

I ordered the Bi Bim Bbap with beef bulgogi and kimchi.  I'd never had it before so I have no knowledge how it compares to anywhere else, but I thought it was really good.  The rice was kind of crispy and I liked the taste a lot.

The room is quite pretty and I'd go back at night to check it out."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 3.5-4.

Hesitant because of the service here. When I went here for my first time, I had a guy that's worked here for about 2 years or so, and he was friendly and knew his sh*t. But, there were some servers there that just looked miserable. For example, the Asian girl that came to run our food just looked like she was not happy to be there or bring us out food or something. FFS, you're in the service industry and you work at a restaurant with AWESOME food. Why so glum, chum? Maybe, it's because they're really pretentious and smiling is not cool enough or something. Maybe some of the un-friendliest (not a word, but gonna use it) servers I've had... def on the list there. Even Jack Astors has nicer, upbeat, smiley servers and I'm not a fan of Jack Astors. Anyway, there was no reason to be miserable around us because we ordered a lot of food, and some drinks and I believe the tipping system there is tip pooled, so just by being in a crappy mood to another table, it could mess up her tip. 

Anyway, most of the ratings goes to the food. Great food, tried the braised beef with mustard seeds and some sort of salad - SO GOOD. port tacos, shrimp tempura with the chili mayo, lobster bibimbap, chapchae, and a bunch of more stuff. The guy was so kind to ask the kitchen for dessert because they didn't have any on the menu or that day or something... The dessert was great. 

Cocktails were great, the peach one (forget the name but it's a bit carbonated too) is sooooooooooo good. 

Even though we got a crappy vibe from some of the other servers, we still tipped over 20% because our server guy was really nice, and the food was really good and we were very satisfied when we were done. 

PS. came in the other day thinking that they were closed at 5 and waited for someone to come out and seat me, they let me wonder around for a minute without telling me that they were closed and once I started seating myself they said something. JUST WEIRD YOU KNOW? It's not that I have anything against female servers at all, it's just at that place, these female servers are the worse man! Would still come back for the food though. So good."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for awhile.. When I did try it, it was a disappointment.

Tried 3 dishes - steamed pork bun, pork neck taco and the swish. They were all delicious and flavorful. The restaurant also has a nice decor - a mix of the modern and the antique. 

Why 2 stars? 

The service was horrible. The waitress who served us talked with a condescending voice and had an annoyed look. When we received the bill, she did not say anything. Actually, we didn't even ask for the bill. She dropped it off at our table without saying anything and after we paid, no word of \"Thank you\" or \"Bye\". 

The experience really wasn't worth what we paid for."}
{"text":"On a chilly night, Vicky, Justine H, and I headed out to Swish By Han to try out their food. I actually have never heard of this place, so I probably never would've stumbled upon this place if it weren't for their suggestion. It wasn't even until I sat down at the restaurant and looked at the menu that I knew they served Korean food. The eclectic dining room decor and dimly lit ambiance is very atypical of most stereotypical Korean restaurants. And the food? While they do serve some what of a fusion style Korean, it was 2 thumbs up for me! 


Once we sat down, a friendly waitress handed us a clipboard with a couple pages of paper that consisted of the menu. I quite liked this over the traditional fold over menus. Swish doesn't offer a very elaborate menu, but it's sufficient and excellent for sharing!


Soo Yook - 48 hour braised beef ($12)
I wouldn't have known it until Justine (who is Korean) said so, but apparently this is a very traditional Korean dish. It was an interesting one to me. The Soo Yook is thinly sliced and served with a sesame oil heavy side salad. The beef was tender and very flavourful, and almost melted in your mouth because of how thin it was. However, I felt this dish lacked substance. Definitely not as filling as some of the other things we ordered that night.


Spicy Pork Buns ($9)
I don't think Justine H or Vicky enjoyed these very much, but I acutally really liked these. As you can see, this was just one spicy pork bun cut into 4 pieces, but they were a good size for people who just want to sample multiple items on the menu like us. The spicy pork wasn't too spicy (was actually on the sweeter side)  and was very saucy. Luckly, there was the perfect amount of bun to counter it. I must admit they weren't the best thing we ordered that night, but I wouldn't rule it out as being well made and delicious.


Spicy pork neck tacos ($10)
Sauciness must be their style here, because just like the Spicy Pork Buns these tacos were loaded with toppings and sauce! It was quite a mess to eat, I don't know how you were supposed to close the tortilla! Not complaining though, it was a big pile of delicious! But be warned, if you have a weak tongue for spices like me, you'll find the pork neck very spicy. Not in painfully bad way though, and it definitely wouldn't deter me from ordering these irresistible tacos again.


Ssam sets (Grilled Pork Belly) ($18)
I just realized now how much pork we ordered that night! If I had to choose one pork dish to rid of, it would probably be this one. Swish by Han actually has a couple types of Ssam sets (rib eye, chicken, short rib), and they all come with rice, kimichi, and lettuce wraps for your meat. I usually love pork belly. In any and all forms. But this one here didn't quite live up to the expectation. What I didn't enjoy, was how burnt the pork belly was. The outsides were completely charred! The pork belly also wasn't fatty enough. If I wanted lean, I would order regular pork!


Lobster bi bim bbap ($18)
Our waitress who was so friendly the entire night, let all of us take pictures of the bi bim bbap before she mixed it up. I think as a result a lot of the rice at the bottom were crisper than the rest. I actually liked it a lot like that! Perhaps you can give that a try next time too? While I love bi bim bbap, but I wasn't jumping out of my seat about this one. I personally didn't taste any lobster and didn't find there was anything too special about it warranting the $18 price tag. Quite ordinary.


Steamed Pork Buns ($10)
After a less than impressive pork belly from the Pork Belly Ssam, I was happy that Swish redeemed its pork belly reputation with these Steamed Pork Buns! They were heavy on the sweet Hoisin sauce, and loaded with radishes, pickled ginger, and other greens. It gave a nice crunch to the fat and buttery pork belly. The bun itself was a bit cold, but not stiff or hard. But to be honest, the pork belly was just too good to even notice anything  else. I would strongly suggest ordering this over the Pork Belly Ssam!

Overall, a really great experience. Would not think twice to come back :)"}
{"text":"Sometimes I just dont wanna go to Koreatown. I love Korean food but I dont always feel like trekking to bloor west and sitting in an authentic korean restaurant with plastic covered menus and melamine glasses of water to drink out of.  Sometimes, I just feel snooty and want to eat out of steaming copper pots with brass chopsticks. On those days, I suggest you head over to Swish by Han.

Our yelping group gathered at the newly put together Swish by Han to try this thing called korean food. What we ended up eating is by no means authentic korean food. Perhaps a twist of it?...a swish if you may? ok ok i'll stop.

Our \"beginners\" included purple yam fries, jellyfish, spicy garlic shrimps and dumplings. The jellyfish tasted fresh and slightly smokey like a seaweed salad, the purple yam fries were a tad overfried. The shrimp were what they were but with a nice spicy kick and I passed on the pork dumplings. 

Then came the task of shabu shabu-ing our own food (which, as our very own Susan C. informed us, is a japanese (not korean) meal option). I sigh at fusion. I really do.  Why must all japanese/korean fusion food require so much work? Shabu shabuing requires a dumping of either beef, seafood or mushrooms into a boiling broth in front of you and then playing the catch me if you can game of trying to get those buggers back onto your plate. Needless to say, Kat F. and I gave up after the first few platefuls. All this aside, our mushroom option came with 5 different types of mushrooms including shitake, portabello & crimini. 

I recommend Swish by Han for a date..something about working together in unison with fire between you, paired with infused Soju (a bottle of straight up soju infused with random flavours like citrus, ginger etc.) makes this a win win situation. 

Keeping that in mind, clearly i'll be back."}
{"text":"Definitely. A strong four stars. I had the eponymous swish, with beef. Portions just right and you getting noodle soup out of what's left. Bibimbap looked good. Kimchi sampler was wonderful"}
{"text":"The food was fine.  The service was not.  he server didn't offer recommendations on the menu when we asked her.  She didn't identify any of the dishes or sauces when she served them.  Overall, she was mediocre.  A place with prices like this should have great service.  

To add insult to injury, an automatic 20% tip (after tax!) was added.  The automatic tip was not mentioned on the menu or on the phone when reservation made. Fact that tip has been added is not mentioned on the receipt.  The server was unapologetic about the system and said it was restaurant policy.  

If a restaurant wants to add an automatic grat as its policy, they should be up front about it.  They should not fail to mention the tip and then set the credit card machine to default to add a second tip.   Despite food being fine, not going back.  

For those who do eat here - read your bill carefully, the automatic grat looks like a tax or one of the menu items.  You may be tipping 44% without realizing it."}
{"text":"We went to swish by Han on July 30, 2014 for a mid week BFF dinner. 
To ensure we get a nice experience, we booked ahead. 
The menu is a bit lacking of fun but we have had a good dinner before, we ordered Bim Bim bab rice and tempura for appetizer.

The tempura was okay. For $12, you get 4 shrimps 
The rice was hot and it was delicious. The beef was a bit fatty but it was quite Tender. 

However, the service was awful. 
We found 3 ants walking on our table. I killed the first toe and after getting our server's attention, we gently informed our server, a young Asian lady. She said \"I could not do anything about that. What do you want me to do? \" 
There  was no apology Or attempted to say \" okay, I would look into it \" 

If you like mediocre food and horrid service, you can pay $32 per person for ants infested dinner."}
{"text":"Cool spot for drinks and snacks! Nice ambiance, and a couple of the dishes were standout - I would suggest the spicy pork buns and the crêpes (nice and crispy!). The rest of the food was only okay, but you have to have the right expectations about this place... for true Korean food, go to Finch, but if you want to take a date for Korean, go to Swish!"}
{"text":"It reminded me of a Korean version of Guu without the loud greetings in Japanese when you enter and leave. Inside decor is modern and hip, with wooden tables and floors, brick walls with artwork, exposed pipes near ceiling and hanging lights and chandeliers. They were playing some type of indie rock music that night which is usually unexpected in a Korean restaurant, but then again, this restaurant is not your typical Korean restaurant you would find in Chinatown or North York.

We tried the pork neck tacos, which were sweet (like the marinated all you can eat bbq meats) and spicy at the same time, they were delicious. Also had the lobster bibimbap, which was done nicely in a hot steaming bowl so there were crispy rice bits on the bottom, it was filling enough to be a meal alone. Lastly, we had the rib eye ssam set, which is already cooked for you, and it's served with lettuce to wrap it in. 

Service was good, our waitress was friendly and helpful. Prices are a bit higher, but its to be expected in the downtown core, esp with most of the customers being professionals who work in the area. Overall it was an enjoyable experience, a unique twist on Korean food with a modern vibe."}
{"text":"Overall, food can sometimes be too sweet, and can be considered overpriced. I can understand why people think that, because the ingredients are never rare or expensive, and some things are actually overpriced...

However, they do have some unique and interesting food on their menu, which gives them the right to charge more for those; you cannot find it anywhere else, and they should be compensated for their innovative creations.

I did not like the dumplings at all. It is just 8 small deep fried dumplings in a fatty creamy sauce mixed with hot pepper oil for $8. This was a rip-off.

The rest of my food was fine. I would have actually enjoyed it more if they were not so overly sweet.

Servers are disgruntled and rude. 

I would not come back because of rude service and overly sweet food. But I can see why some people would love it. Great decor and unique food."}
{"text":"Swish is a very nice restaurant, I had a great meal with friends and the shabu shabu was really well presented and delicious.  The renovated decor is really earthy and warm.  They have done a spectacular job setting up the space. I really enjoyed the ambiance, if only there were some more people in the place.

We started with some jellyfish-noodle salad, yam frites with spicy mayo and some excellent pork and chive dumplings, we also had the spicy shrimp which was a little too bold and was topped with what tasted like standard bbq sauce, not the greatest flavour to mix with shrimp IMO.

The shabu shabu comes out with plenty of veggies and a modest portion of seafood, beef or mushrooms.  The mushrooms were all clean and fresh, superb quality; the beef was bright and well-mottled, an excellent cut; and the seafood was fresh and delicious.  They have cute little portable stoves for the broth, and the fish broth was superb, clear and tasty without a lot of salt.  Once you have cooked and eaten the veggies and meat, they prepare either noodles or rice in the broth right at the table to finish.

I tried soju for the first time and it was quite good, we tried the ginger-infused and it was tasty without being overwhelming as ginger sometimes can. The infusion simply masked some of the harshness associated with soju.  

Swish is a little pricey for the full shabu shabu, but it was a good dining experience, go check it out!"}
{"text":"Finally came for lunch after hearing about Swish just after it opened.  Nice energy to the space, it was a sunny day, so the room was really bright and most tables were full.  An animated crowd.  Kept it simple, my wife and I both ordered the Dolsot Bim Bap: 1bulgogi & 1 seafood and started with the house dumplings.  Really terrific dumplings, could have made a meal of them.  The mains were also very good, nice flavours and generous serving size; it would be easy for them to sub in more rice, being much cheaper, but they don't.  We had 2 friendly servers, who explained the menu and how the Bim Baps are made by putting the clay dished right on the stove, to produce the crispy rice bottom.

The owners have opened up a 2nd joint:  Odd Seoul on Ossington."}
{"text":"I first read of Swish by Han in the Metro while going to work. The review proclaimed a new fresh and funky Korean restaurant had opened up in the downtown core - sounded intriguing. That was 8 months ago. 

I have seen been to Swish by Han two times and both visits were very impressive. The first was a family outing with my mother and two of her good friends who were in town. We had arrived at the restaurant for lunch. The decor is absolutely stunning and has a very warm inviting feel. The owners have chosen to go with an industrial open wooden concept. The tables are large slabs of tempered wood supported by steel. The ceilings are high and on the back wall is a graphic print of Kimchi being made in its traditional way - outside in clay pots. The other wall has open brick and gives a rustic feel. 

Now to the food. We had the bim bim bap -  a traditional Korean rich dish of mixed vegetables, egg and meat. It came with great presentation - elevated in a clay bowl over a candle. The portion was a decent size and the overall blend of rice, vegetables, meat, and sauces were great - the two of use shared. Overall, it was good. The next dish was the Swish. To explain, the Swish is a do-it-yourself broth-like-soup and it comes over a portable-funky looking bunsen-burner. You can get the Swish in three variants - meat, seafood and mushroom. Each one comes with different vegetables and the broth varies. You cook the food yourself which makes for a fun and interactive experience - don't worry, the waiter explains how to do it. My mom's friends' got the seafood which was to die for - the broth was so incredibly good I drank what was left after. We got the mushroom Swish which was absolutely fantastic. I'm a big mushroom fan but I don't remember the combo of mushrooms. Regardless, they were carefully selected and went perfectly with the broth and vegetables. Once we were done with our Swish the waiter - also the owner - mentioned how the next step was one of the following with the Swish: he provides home-made sweet noodles that go into the broth or he makes a rice-like risotto out of the broth. It's not a desert but a follow-up after the Swish. We chose the risotto and the other two the noodles. Both were amazing. 

I've always said I had two stomachs. One for food and the other for dessert. Now for dessert and oh-my-god was it ever good. We had this dessert called \"Bingsu.\" I'm going to try to explain this as best as I can because its really hard fathom. It's essentially delicious chocolate ice cream, resting upon a layer of semi-sweet red beans, and is nestled upon layers and layers of shaven ice. Now, when you eat this exquisite desert the combination of the chocolate, red bean, and shave ice morphs into some culinary explosion of awesome leaving your taste buds begging for more. Lucky for all of us, this dessert is a behemoth and meant for sharing with at least two people. It's really good. Try it. 

I recommend people give Swish by Han a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"this is my most favorite restaurant in toronto. i would say the food is korean fusion - classic korean dishes with a modern twist. the atmosphere is warm and inviting with lots of reclaimed wood and exposed brick. they also play great music - generally some kind of hip-hop / funk. the owner seems fairly young but nevertheless is a boss and seems to know whats up when it comes to creating an awesome dining experience - even the food has soul.

must order: pork neck tacos, jap chea: mung bean noodles stir fry, pear kimchi salad, and chicken ssam set (much like a build your own lettuce wrap).

this is a great place to go with a few friends to share a meal. this is not the kind of place you would go for individual dishes. part of the experience here is being able to try the wide variety of diverse and complex flavours each dish has to offer.

***i suggest making a reservation ahead of time, it is a fairly small restaurant and is always busy... for obvious reasons***

10/10"}
{"text":"I really hand a fantastic time here.

This is what a dining experience should be like. Great vibe, great staff, music was great (they where playing 90's hip hop) 
and the food was fantastic. Everything we ordered was excellent. 

We also ordered a drink, I believe it was JD with honey and some other mix. What ever it was, I was amazing. I couldn't stop drinking them.

This is a place that I'm glad I experienced and will for sure be back."}

Everything I ordered was beyond my expectations. The timing of each dish was perfect. The presentation of the food was mouth watering. The flavors in each dish blew my taste buds away! 
Very attentive staff, really friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. 
Ordered a few cocktails, can't remember the names but they were just as delicious as the food!
The dumplings are a must try! 
The beef tounge dish was probably the most delicious dish I've tasted in a long time.
All in all this place is a must try! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the SLM 'hood. 

Swish by Han is not your typical Asian restaurant (massive portions, all-you-can-eat BBQ, etc.). It's a contemporary, hip, more upscale take on Korean food, as you might find in Seoul. For instance, on a recent visit, they were testing out a kim chi recipe that included pineapple (delish!) and were trying out some tweaks to the pork neck tacos, one of my favourite menu items.

It's a young team that runs the uber-stylish room, led by front of house manager Leeto Han and his bro, the exec. chef Leemo Han. 

After more than a year of regular dinners here, have tried and enjoyed a majority of things on the menu, although it changes every so often to incorporate specials or try out new things. Have also had two birthday dinners here, including a special prix-fixe dinner for a large party that left everyone stuffed and in utter bliss (the slow-roasted pork shoulder was especially AMAZING).

All in all, it's a fun neighbourhood place with a great vibe, wonderfully friendly staff, appealing presentation and tasty, interactive food. I don't find the prices high, when you consider the 'hood and the creativity of the kitchen."}
{"text":"If you plan on coming here and spending less than $30 a person, I suggest you fill up on a 6\" sub at a nearby subway before making your way in here.

The food isn't cheap for the portion size. Although the place is a bit trendy, it's more of a hipster joint than a \"core downtown\" kind of restaurant that can get away with that kind of pricing.

And for a restaurant downtown that charges a lot for the portion sizes, the wait staff are rather... Well, they don't look like waiters exactly. They're rather inappropriately dressed actually. Many of them wear tank tops with their tattoos and piercings shown off. There are a few hipster types without the tats and piercings, but they don't look like waiters either. But even though they don't look the part, they weren't too bad with the service (though it definitely could have been friendlier).

The steamed pork buns are overrated. Some people I know told me it should be on my to-order list, so I got one. It was okay, but it's honestly not that much better than getting one from some other place like Banh Mi Boys. 

Ssam wasn't spectacular or anything. It was just \"meh\". They provide you with the meat of your choice and some chopped up veggies to put inside a leaf of lettuce. It's a neat experience, but it wasn't anything to be wowed about.

I'd recommend their grilled mackerel though, if you see it on the menu. It was very good. They torch it up in front of you, so you get a bit of a fire show. It's also small (portion-wise), especially if you plan on sharing between more than two people.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either."}
{"text":"The BBQ pulled pork sandwich is amazing. I want one right now. Please don't ever publish the calorie count"}
{"text":"Pork Neck Tacos - amazing flavors and succulent pork will keep me coming back to this place for my taco cravings. And SPICY! 

Tempura Shrimp - juicy and crunchy shrimp in a spicy sauce served with amazing cold thin noodles and some green sauce. LOVING IT.

Ssan - Galbi - yummy but tasted average. No wild crazy flavors here, but they have done simple meat flavors right.

Have more dessert on hand, for those with sweet fangs!!

Tone the volume down on the music. Keep the DRANKS coming and you have the recipe for an amazing night solo or with peeps."}
{"text":"its a fun place for good food. not expensive just right for lunch!"}
{"text":"When I first came to Swish the first 2 times, I think I would have rated it a strong 4 star. Great decor, good server recommendations on how much food to order (since most of the dishes are shared). 
I agree with the comments that it is a bit overpriced, but for the location and the \"vibe\", I expected that.

HOWEVER, my more recent experiences (last 2 times) dropped it to a 3. 
I took my family here for a birthday (table of 6) and asked if I could use the travelzoo voucher I purchased (pre-paid and valid for 2 dishes and 1 table top set). I was going to order these items anyway, but if I could apply it that would be great. They said no, because the code needed to be validated ahead of time, with the reservation and only works for tables of 2. At the end, I was charged a whopping 23% gratuity (usually group gratuity applies to tables of 8+,  and its 15 or 18%) with no special cake or anything as I mentioned it was a birthday event when I reserved. 

My next experience was a reservation of 2, to use my voucher.  They took my voucher number ahead of time and when the bill came, they charged us HST on the full amount, which is wrong, since what I had was a voucher, not a gift certificate, and charged 15% gratuity automatically on the original amount. While I was ready to pay 15% gratuity on the original amount as suggested on most deal vouchers, I felt almost insulted that they pre-charged us in a \"classy\" establishment like they expected me to run off without a tip."}
{"text":"Went to Swish the for the first time and can confirm - it's good stuff. Cannot remember the name of the meal I ordered but it had rice, veggies and crispy lobster served in a really hot bowl. Very interesting texture and great flavour. My better half had a braised beef rib over mashed potato type thing. That was excellent as well. Just to try something new, we ordered the Soju beverage, personally, I won't do that again. We'll be going back though."}
{"text":"It was very different from the Korean place I've been before. 
The price is fancy as well as the food. We had a really good time! 
I tried the galbi ssam set. lobster bibim bab and sweet chili shrimp with cucumber soju.
Very nice combination for me! 
Will go back again!"}
{"text":"So I read the reviews and didn't expect much coming to Swish! Plus I'm not a fan of over paying for Korean food since I'm a regular in the yonge/finch area. Our group of friends even included a Korean who shared in my lack of expectations! 

But actually....I was quite impressed with the food and presentation!! This is a Korean izakaya which reminds me of the izakaya chains in Vancouver! We shared a few plates - lobster bim bim bap, Kim chi platter, pork belly wraps, and the seafood and beef hot pot. It was a lot of food! I loved how congee was made after we were done the hot pot. I liked the quality/freshness of the ingredients and the way all the dishes were presented. I would actually come back too!

The only complaint is the service,  there was attitude and my menu took a long long time to come. If they improve the service staff they'd really be 4 stars. I'd give them 3.5 for now but round up :)"}
{"text":"Swish by Han has a deceiving name, you may think the restaurant is German or Austrian, but in reality, is a Korean tapas restaurant.  The price points are much higher than most Korean restaurants, but most of the food is prepared to a higher caliber.  I stress the most because not everything is better and perhaps not better for restaurants that are \"known\" for a particular dish, but on an overall basis is better than most.  

During this visit, we started with the sweet chili and garlic prawns ($12).  The sauce is exactly as described, sweet, a bit spicy and a kick of garlic; all great flavours.  The shrimp were deep fried and then stir fried with the sauce.  Overall, the dish was good but not amazing and lacking a Korean flare to it.  In terms of value for money, the dish definitely isn't worth what it's asking for. 

The lobster \"bi bim bbap\" ($18), was a dish I had on our first visit and loved, so insisted we get it again.  Sadly, it wasn't as good as I remembered.  I believe the problem stemmed from the waitress putting it down and stirring it up right away (sorry, the picture looks like a pot of mess as I wasn't quick enough to snap a picture before the destruction began).  I understand, this is the correct way to eat it - drizzle in the thick sweet and spicy gochujang sauce then mix until all the ingredients are disbursed.  But, this also makes the deep fried lobster mushy and doesn't give the rice a chance to develop a crispy crust on the bottom.  I would have much preferred if they just served it, explained what the customer should do and let them decide when the moment to mix is. 

Our last dish was the best of this evening, the \"dak kogi\" (chicken) ssäm set ($25).  The teriyaki type glazed chicken is served on a hot sizzling skillet with slivers of carrots, cucumbers and onion.  To eat, you take a piece of romaine lettuce, add the ingredients, top with any condiment you like (we were given gochujang sauce, raw onion mixed in a pickled kimchi sauce), then wrap it up and ingest! My first experience having ssäm, I really liked it and would love to go back to try the beef or pork versions.   

During a past visit, I tried the Swish Seafood ($30), which is like shabu shabu or hot pot.  A small pot of broth is brought to the table along with plate of raw shrimp, mussels, vegetables and noodles.  It's a good option for someone who doesn't like spicy or overly strong tastes - compared to other items on their menu.  However, for someone that loves bold flavours, I found it to be pretty bland.  Plus, because you're only cooking a few ingredients within the broth, it didn't develop that lovely deep essence I normally associate with broth based cooking.

Many reviews note the service here is poor, I didn't find that to be the case.  I would say there were better servers than other - a gentleman that took our order was nice and explained everything and offered suggestions, while the lady server was a bit moody and offered one word answers (she was also the one that mixed up the bi bim bbap without asking). In the end, it wasn't extremely friendly service but no one was overtly rude either.

{"text":"I was disappointed with the food and the overall experience. Because the reviews here seemed great. The people that raved about this place probably hadn't had any better. (Like, good Korean food) I give it 3 stars for the 48 hr braised beef. It was flavourful.

Finding the place was a chore, their banner wasn't ledgible even when we walked closer. You can't tell it's \"Swish by Han\" in some squiggly lines.

The food didn't taste like Korean food, more like Westernized items with an identity crisis. Lobster bimbimbap ($18). I've had better bimbimbap in an average Korean place for $7. There were just a few pieces of deep fried, heavily battered lobster in there. Can't really taste the lobster. Then the rest of the bowl was filled with plain rice and some pickled veggies. There's not much flavour there, very bland.

Pork belly bun was soaked in hoisin sauce, too much seasoning. If you like pork belly bun or similar, go to Banh Mi Boys. They do it better for cheaper. And you'll be full after at least. This tiny pork belly bun was $5.

My friends and I had to go to a second dinner after this! I ate a burger after. We were still hungry after spending $25 each here. The portions were small for what you paid for, and we had to pay otherwise free items in a regular Korean restaurant. e.g. the side dishes and mung bean noodles.

Sleek designs with a posh atmosphere. But it's an overrated, pretentious place with overpriced but average tasting food. Not to mention bad service. Rude/deadpan faced waitress that we all sensed that was a bit bi*chy grudgingly serviced us... lol. She didn't greet us with a \"Hello\", instead:\"Close the door!\" (How would we have known the door doesn't close itself?!)  Then she walked off to a table without a word and threw some menus down the table and walked off. It was a confusing entrance. I had to go up to her again to confirm that I made a reservation and I'm here to claim it. Her name was Jocelyn. Maybe she was having a bad day lol. She looked very serious or even not happy to be there at all. The place was cold like the Toronto blackout. We were cold throughout dinner. 

If you love Korean food, go to Kachi by Spadina and St. Andrews St. instead. Or the one next door, they even give you free food! FYI for your 2nd dinner, there's The Works just down the street lol!"}
{"text":"I went here to catch up with a few friends and everyone loved it! We shared three small places (Spicy pork sliders , Spicy pork neck tostadas, Beef tongue soo yook)  and one large plate (SBH Dolsot Bibimbap) between four girls for lunch. The meal came with two pork sliders and two tostadas which were pretty small. The beef tongue soo yook was delicious and I would def recommend trying the beef tongue! They recommend wrapping the thin slice of braised beef tongue with the mixed greens which was pretty neat! :)
As for the large plates, The Dolsot Bibimbap was totally not worth it for $17. It looks and tastes like normal stone bowl korean bibimbap from any authentic Korean resto (for $9-12) but with fancier meat. Veggies, sauce, rice, and everything else was the same. 
Overall, I had a great time at Swish by Han! I would definitely go back and try their Kimchi Tofu and Ssam next time!"}
{"text":"Delicious Korean food presented with flair and ambience.

There are of course great Korean food in Koreatown or North York but this place is more trendy and date night friendly."}

Extra information:

*Open for lunch
*Big portion for Tapa style
*Closed on Sundays

Korean food and fusion style- just sounded like a disater to me. It's hard enough to impress me with Korean food but fusion? I had my doubts. However, my experience at Swish by Han completely washed away my doubts and I was more than impressed.

Inside of the restaurant is nicely lit with few chandliers and tastefully decorated with touches of Korean culture here and there. It definitely does not look like your ordinary Korean restaurant which was different.

Ordered: Iced Honey & Mint Tea 4/5

* Non-alcoholic Iced tea for $5
* Was too tired to drink alcohol so went with the Iced Tea
* Tasted like Mojito + Lemonade
* It was refreshing and went well with the meal

Ordered: Spicy Pork Buns 3/5

* Spicy pork served in Soft Buns for $9
* This was cut into 4 pieces (might have been cause there were 4 of us)
* Pork was cooked in sweet + spicy sauce with veggies with a hint of smokiness
* There was a lot of sauce inside which made it quite messy to eat because it was cut into small pieces- things started falling out of the bun
* You could def tell this had strong korean flavors built into the recipe. I would have enjoyed it if they held back on the sauce just a tad bit

Ordered: Spicy Pork Tacos 4/5

* 2 taco for $10
* Asian flavor inspired tacos are popular these days
* Comes with a lot of filling/topping such as spicy pork pieces, cabbage, kimchi and mayo
* I found this to be pretty spicy and I am Korean! So be aware if you can't handle spicy food
* It comes with lime but I didn't use it (didn't think it was necessary)
* It helps if you eat some of the fillings with your chopstick first and then wrap up the rest because they give you lots of fillings for this dish

Ordered: Steamed Pork Buns 5/5

* 2 Steamed Bun with pork belly and veggies for $10
* One of their popular dish (special of the day)
* 2 pieces of fatty pork belly inside each bun served with japanese pickle(radish), green onion, cucumbers and special sauce (GoChuJang; korean chili paste & Hoisin Sauce)
* First time I tried steamed pork buns were at Momofuku, New York and this specific dish was fusion between Korean-Chinese
* More hoisin sauce than GoChuJang (less spicy)
* Special sauce is really strong and the pork belly is fatty but the radishes and cucumbers balance out the richness of this dish
* This is a must try!!

Ordered: Soo Yook 5/5

* 48 hour braised beef shank served with salad for $12
* Nice, colorful presentation- beef is shaved thin and it goes well with the spring mix salad and green onion
* Salad is bursting with flavor (sweet tangy vinegrette with a hint of sesame oil)
* I felt like this dish was one of the most authentic tasting dish out of all
* Although it is a meat dish, it's light and would be good as an appetizer
* I would get this again, it was sooo yummy!

Ordered: Lobster BiBimBap 4/5

* BiBimBap with lobster meat served in stone bowl for $18
* Veggies (spinach, eggplant, radish, zucchini, bean sprout) and fried eggs. basically your ordinary BiBimBap with chunks of lobster meat
* They bring the dish to the table and mix it for you with the GoChuJang (Korean Chili Paste) so you can control how spicy you want this dish to be
* Because we were asking her if we can take pictures of it before she mixed it up, * Stone bowl comes really hot and this creates all the crunchy rice on the bottom
* Another dish that I really enjoyed

Ordered: Pork Belly Ssam 3/5

* Pork belly served with rice, kimchi and lettuce for $18
* Swish by Han is a Ssam & Shabu Bar, you must at least try one of them! so we chose the pork belly ssam set 
* Served with 2 different types of KimChi but they both tasted the same to me
* Served with lettuce and rice, you take the lettuce and wrap up rice with the pork belly- add the spicy sauce as well as some kimchi and eat it!
* Pork belly pieces were fatty and this dish was decent but it didn't impress me that much
* Much prefer regular authentic Korean porkbelly BBQ

Overall I really enjoyed the dishes at Swish by Han. It might be because I really wasn't looking to be impressed but few of their dishes were super tasty and the flavors weren't over done. Service was awesome and both of the girls who helped us were super friendly and helpful with the menu.

Summary: If you love Korean food and is looking for something new, Swish by Han is for you. If you are new to Korean food and would like to try it but take a baby step, Swish by Han is for you as well. They serve strong, bold Korean flavors in a new, innovative way and you def want to be part of it. I've already gone back once and I will def be back again soon :)

{"text":"Went back for lunch the other day. I've started eating meat again so wanted to try this place again with a whole new range of options to choose from. Had the spicy pork ssam which was delicious!!! Sweet, spicy, sticky pork balance by crisp fresh lettuce wraps and a delicious sauce on the site added a nice kick. Would happily have licked the plate of pork clean. 

Next up, I have to go back at dinner for their lobster bi bim bap. I hear it's excellent!"}
{"text":"My friends and I dined for my birthday on Saturday night. We were a group of 6 and ordered a whole variety of dishes to share. Overall I guess I had high expectations of the food as I had heard a lot of good things about this restaurant and how they create a new kind of Korean fusion. It wasn't THAT spectacular. Just your everyday good Korean food. The decor and ambience however, was wonderful and inviting and very hip.

The FOOD: the lobster bibimbap was like any other old bibimbap at your local Korean restaurant, but this one plus the tiny bits of lobster suddenly made it $18...The presentation on a lot of the dishes was beautiful, hence the price I guess. The pork bun rolls were the most memorable, very tasteful and mouth watering. Not too satisified with the price to food quality ratio. Like I said, its just like any other Korean diner food, but a tad prettier.

The downside, a big one, which loses major stars for me, was the service. Coming to our table she didnt even introduce herself or any specials or looked like she even gave an interest in working that night. I was kind of taken aback at her demeanor, no smiles, no enthusiasm to be serving my party at all. Out of our party of 6, 5 of us were at one point full time servers...which to me becomes a double negative as having been in the industry I would have never represented my job in that manner.

I would have loved to come back just to dine again in a fancy, hip place with decent food, however, to me the price and overall \"feel\" or this place doesn't justify my choice to do so."}
{"text":"I've been in Toronto this week for work and really jonesing for Korean.
I'm staying in the wrong area for this but noticed Swish the other night while walking around.

As I walked in I was very impressed by the set up. Its small but very nice.
I was there a bit before dinner so I was the only one in the place. I took a look at the menu and was waiting for all the great items that usually come to you prior to ordering. Nope-never came. Although a bit disappointed I pushed on and ordered the short rib lettuce wraps. I won't say they were incredible or that I'd never had anything like this. They were good but I really expected them to be good.

Compared to the local rundown places I usually go to this is a bit more expensive but not painfully so. Overall I liked the place but was over the top crazy. 

I'd go back if I can't find another place around."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for some good asian food in the area.  This is definitely the best korean fusion food I've ever had!  The manago kimchi crepes are a must.  The jap chae and bi bim bap roll also deserves a mention.  The green tea bingu, vanilla ice cream with green tea and red bean flavours on shaved ice was SUUUUPEEEER!

We also loved the sauce that came with the Beef Swish.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"In  a nutshell, good korean food, slightly adjusted for the Canadian palate, at a good price range for the area.

I was introduced to this as a Korean version of Guu, so I came into this expecting for a rowdy bar style environment to share small plates with two good friends. Definitely not the environment that I found. The place is bright and natural, with a bit of hipster-modern. Other than the picture of the fermenting pots on the wall, I never would have guessed this was an asian restaurant.There is one large table where they can seat a large group, but the restaurant is small, and I would only come here with a group of 3-4 people

The menu seems to change every once in a while, so it's lucky I didn't fall madly in love with any of the dishes. Being said, almost every dish was well executed, paced well, and the service was friendly. There are a number of Japanese style dishes (the two cuisines often comingle), but looking for a more Korean experience, we tried the fried capelin, prawns with tobiko and seaweed salad, lobster bibimbap, bulkogi ssam, and the ban chan trio. The portions were a bit larger than expected. An small person could be satisfied by eating only one or two of the 'hot plates', or one ssam set, whereas you would expect to order 3-4 at any 'small plates' style restaurant.

Despite having barely any lobster, the lobster bibimbap was even larger than I would expect from a typical yonge-street korean restaurant that serves this as a main dish. The bottom was crunchy, and the flavours were bold, just the way a bibimbap should be.
The fried dishes were also well done; without any heavy greasiness, and complemented well by sauces for each. My only disappointment was the ban chan trio, the flavours were rather lacking, and the texture of the beans reminded eerily only of large black beans that are soaked but uncooked .

Without drinks, the bill came to $70 for three small-ish eaters. Reasonable price range for eating around financial district (well it's probably considered just outside), but this is the first time I've ever paid for side dishes at a korean restaurant!I wouldn't consider any of the dishes revolutionary or particularly unique, but each was made well and I would come back here again."}
{"text":"I hit this place up for a date after having walked by it countless times. I was quite impressed by it. It does have a different vibe, but its a good switcher upper every so often. 

The food is amazing and is served in very creative ways. I enjoy asian food and this place offers a modern twist on classic dishes. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Service was amazing and the food was fantastic.  I've been waiting for a Korean place like this that offers all the favorites with a modern twist.  Personal faves were the pear kim chi salad with blue cheese, spicy pork buns and those shrimps!!!! Sooooo good.  You have not had a dolsot bibimbap like this place before... Must try"}
{"text":"3.5 stars rounded up - both food and service were good. You definitely need reservations during the prime dinner rush. A good overall experience.

On the plus side:

- Cool modern decor but maintains a nice laid back atmosphere. Business crowd during weekdays.

- Service was fast and efficient and the server took his time explaining various menu questions / options.

- A few beer selections available - reasonably priced. The Soju flights were surprisingly good - a smooth, clean and refreshing taste, a nice pairing for Korean influenced food. 

- I started with the warm Mushroom salad. I really enjoyed this dish since I love mushrooms. They used about 5 types of mushrooms and sprinkled some red peppers on top of the nicely dressed salad.

- Next up was the 48 hour braised beef shank. The meat had delicious flavour and was very tender - melted in your mouth. Served on a salad with green onion and red peppers. Highly recommended.

- I really enjoyed the Pork Belly Ssam. The dish is served with rice, lettuce, various Kimchee's, and a house spicy sauce (not too spicy). You make a lettuce wrap with all the ingredients. I don't normally eat pork belly but really enjoyed this dish. Pairing with the cool fresh lettuce took some emphasize of the fattier cut of meat.

On the down side:

- WARNING - There is a \"picky\" giant plant as soon as you walk in. I got caught up in it immediately walking through the door... talk about an embarrassing entrance. I noticed a few peoples clothes getting caught in this crazy plant.     

Overall... I enjoyed my experience at Swish and will return again soon. I always enjoy tapas style since you can order lot's of different dishes to share. And next time, I will try and avoid that crazy plant.

{"text":"The food was good, the ambiance was enchanting but I don't get how they can charge so much for food you cook yourself. We ordered the seafood swish, portions were decent, we were able to share but felt a little hungry afterward. This would be good for one hungry person.

This would have to be the best Korean food experience I had but paying the higher price compare to other Korean restaurants wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my food experience here. This is an upscale version of Korean food. 

Decor 5/5 - I liked the modern eclectic and Korean feel of the place. The place is nicely decorated everything from the candles, chandeliers and art on the walls works well together. The wooden floors and lighting of the place creates a trendy but inviting atmosphere. 

Food - 4/5. All the dishes are meant to be shared. We ordered the spicy pork buns. The pork was soft and had the distinct flavour of go chu hang (red Korea pepper paste), served on a burger bun. Next we tried the tempura prawns, which was cooked perfectly and lightly battered. I loved the mayo sauce and the salad that the prawns were served with. 

For mains we ordered the seafood hot pot dish. This comes with a variety of seafood such as mussels, prawns, octopus, squid, crab balls and some other types of seafood. It is also served with vegetables like bok choy, napa cabbage, various mushrooms. There is the option of having rice or noodles at the end. I believe the noodles were kalguksu (Korean knife cut noodles). 

By the time you add in the seafood and vegetables it gives the broth a really great depth of flavour. I recommend going with the noddles if you order this. 

Dessert was a pecan apple crumble with ice cream. There was a nice balance between the tartness of the apple and the sweetness of the crumble. Loved it! 

Service - 4/5. The server was friendly and able to explain the menu and recommend some choices for the side dishes. 

I'll be back to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"I was taken here for a birthday dinner recently and thought it was great. We had some pork tacos for an appetizer and they were amazing! The main dish was great as well, excellent BBQ garlic beef and a good selection of beverages. I have only a few complaints....not enough food for the price, as well as the tables are mostly long picnic table style and don't leave a lot of room for privacy. Also, although we had reservations, we were told that we could not have a table for two that was open because they were 'all reserved'. Seemed a little strange to me. Overall the food was great though."}
{"text":"This place is always great. The atmosphere is amazing, the food is always exceptional and the beer is fresh and cold. 10 out of 10 for me. 

Every time I go I love it."}
{"text":"Been here twice. I was there for my birthday yesterday and I was really not impressed with the service, atmosphere and food. 
The quality of food is decent. Yummy. But they give you so little to possibly enjoy it. We spent about $40 per person and everybody came out hungry. We had to go elsewhere for more food and dessert. 
Staff service really sucks here. You would imagine that at a restaurant charging this much money to have an excellent service. 
I like the interior decor. Nice fusion between Korea and western looks. But they play some ghetto hip hop all night and it was too loud. I couldn't hear my friends. 
I gave this restaurant 2 tries. I'm not going back."}
{"text":"All in all, an above average experience.  Went with about 4 or 5 friends and ordered a wide-variety of food that left us feeling content.  WIth a bottle of wine that was excellent, we were able to enjoy an evening at the restaurant for about $60 pp.

THe food was great! Presentation was amazing.  Not too many veggie options (though that wasn't expected it being a Korean restaurant).  The food was pleasantly spicy with a lot of flavor and enough quantity to go around!  I would definitely suggest trying the \"sets\" as this is more a family-style restaurant.

Advise to the owner - PLEASE move that thorny plant front and center in the walkway.  It does hurt quite a bit to get pricked when walking to our table! :)  Other than that, a big fan and definitely encourage you to check this spot out if you're near the downtown area."}
{"text":"I was surprised by this place. We went here for Valentines Day and was half full, not a huge place. We got the seafood crepe things (yummy), spicy pork buns (yummy), short ribs ssam set (delicious)
I would go back! its a little much compared to usual korean places but a nice change :)"}
{"text":"I rate it 1 just because I can not rate minus! It was a horrible experience tonight and ruined my beautiful image of Canada. 

We came to this place just because of pictures on yelp looking like good. But when we sat down, there was nothing like before they had. A waitress with a golden hair told us they had changed the menu. She was patient and nice.

BUT!!! The service of that Asian guy and Asian woman is NIGHTMARE!  

We ordered dishes at 8pm but we didn't get our main course until 9pm! After I told that miserable looking Asian woman we were starving!  But the thing is that she didn't feel any sorry for us and even didn't say one word \"sorry\", which would have made me feel much better. What was worse, she said \"it should be like that long and I don't know why this is a problem!\" She then turned away and didn't wait for me finishing my words!  She said our dishes were coming but actually we waited for another 15mins.  And she thought it was not a problem that customers waited for a hour with a starving stomach! 

That is offensive! Very much!  Especially her sad and unhappy look! 

The drama was continuing. Considering their terrible service and attitude, we decided to pay no tips. The Asian guy started to yell at us and said \"All I need is you sign your name!\" And he thought nothing to apologize! At last , he shout at us \"Get out!\" 



Yeah, it is not their mistake. It is mine! I should have never come into here! 

And just like their name \"Swish by Han\", short in quality and short in personality."}
{"text":"The food was great! Spicy pork buns and mushroom salad were outstanding. The cocktails are delish, though spendy at $12 a pop (ouch!) The service was attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is upbeat and fun, though my dinner pals and I had to shout at one another to be heard over the music (hmmmm). The bill, with one drink each, for three of us was $100."}
{"text":"1. Finding this place is a challenge. You enter through 40 Wellington, not the door labeled 36-38 Wellington. Furthermore, the sign above the door at 40 Wellington says TREVOR. Trust me, this is actually the entrance to Swish by Han. 

2. The music is so loud. Way, way too loud. In fact, I have never heard music played so loudly in a restaurant. The staff refused to turn it down.

3. The decor is lovely. Lots of wood and excellent lighting.

4. The food is delicious and the kitchen is prompt. My dining partner and I both had the one \"large plate\" item that was meatless. I don't remember the name of it but it was wide glass noodles fried with onions, peppers and two kinds of mushrooms. So good !  I also had the Saba small plate which the server subjected to a blowtorch tableside.

{"text":"This place offered some pleasant korean food to eat. We tried at least 3 dishes during our visit and loved it. If your talking about JUST THE FOOD, this place is worth the trip. 

Cons:

 I didn't like about it is that you are basically sharing a table with other strangers in a long dining table...I like to have my space. Plus, the loud talking and the music. It was loud enough that it towers over your own voice and you have to be a little louder than usual when talking. 

And yeah, the hot pot was a bit expensive... I saw some people order it but it didn't look THAT impressive to be pricey. 

Pros:

Good customer service. I think we were lucky on that day that the servers were a little upbeat. Aside that, the food was amazing. Omg, am already planning on going again when I have time. I dont really need to elaborate on that part though... just go see for yourself. :)

When the customers died down a bit when I was there... you can actually appreciate the place more and how it's unique to others. Just try not to go on a busy hour... you'll actually like it more."}
{"text":"Food was DELICIOUS. Service was HORRENDOUS. 
There's a good reason that 20%  gratuity is enforced; I wouldn't have tipped a penny. 

I've been a waitress, and I was terrible at it, so I typically cut a lot of slack when it comes to service. I could have gotten over the misinformation she gave me on the phone, the awkwardness when we came in, the total lack of helpfulness with the menu, and maybe even her total rudeness and holier-than-thou attitude, had she cracked a smile ONCE. 

The restaurant design is nice and the food is good, but nothing is ingenious and there is certainly nothing about this place that's hip enough to warrant the kind of tude we experienced.

Skip it."}
{"text":"From an aesthetic viewpoint Swish by Han is a lovely, lovely room. The brick, the wood, the low lighting...it all works. There was a quietness about the room, then again, it wasn't very busy. Location wise SBH is competing with a couple of heavy hitters by having restos like Lucien and Trevor, along with a couple of bars (Pravda & the Rezzie) all competing for diners attentions. I suspect it'll be tough sledding for Swish. 

The previous two reviews (Farheen and Dave. \"It's all about the five stars\" O.) were both quite positive. I must say I really enjoyed trying the carafe of Korean booze called Soju. We ordered the ginger infused version of it and the more I drank of it, the more I liked it. Susan forewarned though, its a hangover waiting to happen. Dave likened it to Korean tequila, encouraging me to eat the worm which was really a big hunk of ginger in the bottom of the carafe. 

I enjoyed the appy's more than the actual main, Swish, itself. My fav app was the Jelly Fish salad which had lots of different things going on in terms of texture and tastes. Fareen is right, Purple Yam Frites (which looked really cool) were well over cooked. Chili Shrimp had a big bang on the first bite but the flavour and the heat waned really quick. Dumplings are what they are, you can get these pretty much anywhere these days even though essentially it works on the same premise. 

The Swish itself was ok. I do find this style of food rather bland though. Essentially you are just boiling everything and for me I think it would have been more enjoyable if they had offered up a small choice of dipping sauces. They gave us each one small bowl of a sweet chili dipping sauce with the exact same flavour that was on the Chili Shrimp app. A Swish costs $25.00 and I'm of the same mind as Dave, they could have been a bit more generous with the meat/seafood. The myriad of mushrooms was great but again, I found it bland and I'm a girl who likes food that has a kick to it. I asked Susan about comparing it to the Rolling Pot and she said it was very different. 

The one part that I found interesting and entertaining was when they added the rice to one of the Swish pots, stirring it until it melded into an almost Congee like concoction. Still though, I found this bland and added some of the dipping sauce to both the rice and the noodles just to give it a flavour boost. 

I hope Swish does well because it is definitely a different option along Wellington Street. I'd venture back in, next time though I'd stick to small plates and middle plates and forgo the Swish altogether."}
{"text":"short review: very good meal, not overly expensive, tasty cocktails, great atmosphere, attentive service, maybe a little lacking in originality though.

long review: i just got back from a meal here with a couple of friends and came away quite impressed. we made reservations (good call, every other table in the restaurant had a reserved sign on it when we arrived) and got down to ordering (after a couple of fantastic mixed drinks - they mix gin particularly well). we decided to mostly get \"dishes\" off the menu, as we felt that would emulate the korean tapas experience that we were going for.

here's what we ordered and then ate (along with would i order it again):

silken tofu with sauteed kimchi (yes)
kimchi'ed pears with stilton cheese (no, which is unfortunate because i thought it was the most adventureous dish on the menu)
spicy pork neck tacos (yes, though they're not quite as good as black hoof's pork tacos)
lobster bi bim bbap (yes)
soo yook (yes)
torched mackerel (no, although the presentation was cool - took a torch to the fish at our table)
steamed bun stuffed with pork belly (special of the day) (GOD YES)
grilled pork belly ssam (SUPER-GOD YES)
alberta beef ribeye bbq set (no - tasted like any korean beef bbq, not all that special)

this was more than enough food for the three of us, we probably could have made do with half as much, we just got a little greedy looking at the menu. sue us. however, reading reviews beforehand had led me to believe that the meal would be more expensive than it really was - for high quality food like this was, i think that the prices and portions were both very reasonable.

our server was very attentive and helpful, definitely made us feel welcome, and our water was never empty.

overall, delicious but not extraordinary.

note: the family behind us got a pork shoulder, which the waitress told us you have to order in advance if you want it. you should want it. it looked and smelled fantastic, and supported my thinking that this restaurant knows how to cook pork."}
{"text":"Went here with Slinky Woman for New Years Eve. What's with the name? Does it comfort me to know it's not Swish by Kim? I'd feel better if Han invented hanguel or the cheugugi. The restaurant is a little hard to find from the street in the dark. I was even sober. The actual name is not very prominent compared to the window lettering that identifies it as a ssäm bar. And why the umlaut? Are they Motörhead,or Deathtöngue? The waitresses are quite tattooed and have their boobs on display. Swish has the trappings of an unnecessary umlaut band in restaurant form. But \"swish\" doesn't conjure up much in the way of Nazareth style power ballads.

We had the swish which turned out to be hot pot. I don't recall Koreans in Korea ever calling it swish. It was usually called shabu shabu, borrowing from the Japanese name for hot pot. Although my extensive research indicates shabu shabu is Japanese onomonopia for the \"swish swish\" sound you make stirring up your hot pot (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabu-shabu). Are they trying to start something here or is this more of that irritating \"let's translate adequately named Korean foods into close english approximations that sound weird to everyone concerned\" Korean proclivity. See my treatise at my kimbap dot com / roll dot com review. (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/roll-com-toronto)

We had the seafood swish which comprised a decent enough seafood for two. We had bi bim bap wraps on the side plus we tried to order the pork neck tacos but got the spicy pork buns instead. Bi bimming the wrap concept didn't really do much for me. The pork buns were amazing, although I'm pretty sure I could knock those off in my slow cooker no probs. Prices were okay, especially for a NYE. 

It does get loud. Not the kind of place you want to discuss the future of your dating relationship with a slinky woman. If you're looking for a kind of funky Asian-y up-market gastropub type experience and you've not experienced a lot of time in Korea sitting cross legged in real Korean soju hofs, you might find Swish by Han exotic and a fun visit.

Cool washrooms."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food, the music and the atmosphere here. Asian fusion at its best. Try the pork belly tacos, potstickers, lobster bi bim bop and kalbi.The waitress forgot about our kimchi side dish, but when we reminded her, she brought it to us and told us she would comp. it since it was coming so late in our meal. We didn't even have to ask. The specialty drinks are also delish. Will definitely continue coming back."}
{"text":"Food: 2/5
The food was nothing special to me. We tried everything on the left side of the menu and they were pretty basic. There was no layers of flavours or any real complexity to their dishes. 

They have a decent selection of drinks including Erdinger wit, Delirium, Soju and Soju mixes at your standard bar prices.

Great atmosphere though, chill hiphop tunes in the background. 

Maybe the right side of the menu will do better next time. I'll give this one another shot if a date wants to try it."}
{"text":"I really like Swish and will be back in the future to try out some of their other dishes.  Place kind of reminded me of Guu with all the tapas sharing plates, etc. The restaurant seems to emphasize more of quality then quantity so you will need to order lots of plates.  Overall, I liked the ambiance.  Customer service can be a bit better though.  Had to wait a long time for someone to come take our order.  However, after we get through that hurdle, there was great food to enjoy."}
{"text":"It may be possible that I've been way too used to actual Korean food that Swish by Han just didn't cut it.

The ambiance and location was nice - located at Front and Wellington. Music was a bit too loud for my friends and I to chat over.  Service wasn't too bad either.

However, for the price that you're paying for Korean food (including Shabu Shabu) - it just wasn't worth it.  Firstly, the kimchi trio that we got wasn't the best kimchi -- it had a strange taste to it.  The silken tofu with sauteed kimchi wasn't bad - I would recommend this.  The deep fried octopus with wasabi tartar wasn't worth it -- too fried and you felt like you had to \"dig\" to find the octopus within the batter

The swish wasn't worth it at all.  I love my shabu shabu/hot pot, but for $25?!  Really - that wasn't worth my money.  I felt like I could've been uptown and bought myself all you can eat (and pretty much the same food) for shabu shabu at the same price."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place for cocktails and a delicious, experimental dinner before a show at Sony Centre, just 2 short blocks away.  Street parking was easy to find at 5:45pm on a Saturday.

COCKTAILS were delicious!  Seoul Train was a really tasty with flavours of pomegranate and lyche and the cucumber mojito was also delicious (though $10 and $12).

AMBIANCE was modern and inviting though very breezy though we sat far from the door.

FOOD was outstanding! Definitely start with the Ban Chan Trio- three little salads to perk your pallet.
-Special: Squash Kimchi Poutine!
After reading many reviews we concocted this menu: 
-Silken Tofu with sauteed kimchi
-48 hr beef
-Pork Neck Tacos

Perfect medium spice level; well developed flavours.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight with 2 Korean friends. It was a trendy/fusion style Korean restaurant with some mood-setting decor. 

We ordered a lot of food (and our bill showed it!), including: Kimchi guksu (noodles), Tofu with Kimchi, mushroom salad, pork buns, chili prawns, and the seafood 'Swish' (hotpot). 

The food was all pretty good, and mostly authentic, BUT unlike typical Korean food the portions were small and the value for food wasn't that great. So if you're a Korean-food lover like me (and also a student), you may want to go to a more authentic, ajumma-owned Korean restaurant, where you'll a) get more food, b) get good value, and c) get banchan with your meal (unlike here, where you have to pay for it).

Service was alright, waitress is a good saleswoman in convincing you to order lots."}
{"text":"Swish by Han 
Very beautiful modern decor. On Friday night, the place was fairly empty. Our server was quite friendly, asked if we had any questions and didn't rush us to order. 

Ended up getting the Pork Belly bowl and Spicy Pork Sliders. The bowl was fairly large easily can be shared between two. The dish was similar to bibimbap but with a western twist. I was intrigued by the restaurant because I thought it would be Korean fusion but it was much too westernized for my liking. The sliders were delicious, portion wise it was two sliders with a beautiful presentation. It was tasty, had good flavors and the combination of the ingredients were perfect. 

Would I come back? Perhaps to try the lunch menu or if the menu changes again. I think the smaller plates are more worth it from my first experience. I do admit it was an interesting twist."}
{"text":"Their water tasted okay. That was all I got from there after waiting for more than 30minutes without being served.

I haven't been served so badly. The waitress has real bad attitude and it was not even busy at all.

And I also went there for lunch a few days ago. While the restaurant was full, my group seated at the waiting area for 5 minutes and was not even been waited. Only was told later that they are not serving lunch anymore.

They disappointed me twice."}
{"text":"I've only been here for lunch, but the food has been good.

For starters, the ban chan trio and kimchi trio are both good choices.

Bibimbap is good, as are some of the rice dishes.  I'm not a huge fan of chap chae, but I suppose the version they serve is as good as any.

The place is LOUD - hard surfaces everywhere and music blaring - I'd hesitate to go if it was full - I don't like screaming at the people I'm with.

And most recently our server was wearing a tie-died tank top.  Really?  wear something more appropriate when you're waiting tables bud."}
{"text":"i wanted to like this place. it looked like it had great ambiance from outside, and i love korean food.

however.

the service was slow and unfriendly. that was one server. the other server was nice, but she didn't seem to know the wine menu very well and had to tell me multiple times (after checking) that they were out of the wine i ordered.

the ambiance would've been nice, but damn, they need some acoustic damping. i could barely hear my friend, and she was sitting just across from me. we had to talk quite loudly.

finally, the spicy pork buns were EXCELLENT. the mushroom salad was mediocre.

given the price (EXPENSIVE) i was expecting it to be a lot better. but i feel like i've had just as good korean food, if not better, in koreatown, and with much better service, at 1/3 the price. 

needs work."}
{"text":"First off, if you're looking for a traditional Korean tofu house or BBQ place, this isn't it--go somewhere else. But that's not what I was after. 

I've had lots of the best Korean food and eaten in my share of grungy holes in the wall that are delicious and cheap. But that's the equivalent of having pancakes with maple syrup every time you eat \"Canadian\". I have wanted for a long time to find a restaurant where a Korean chef uses their imagination and goes beyond tradition. This is what you get at Swish by Han.

It's an upscale place so it's not cheap. But it's not outrageous for what you get. They make their own kimchee and it's delicious. There's the traditional napa cabbage and daikon radish kimchees, and when I was there, also a baby bok choy and pineapple kimchee that was amazing! Usually I am left dissatisfied by restaurant kimchee; it never rivals what you can make at home with long fermentation. But this stuff was amazing.

Another plus was that everything is fresh. No canned sauces and dips, everything from scratch, and the flavour shows. I really appreciate chefs who watch out for the details, because that's what makes a great meal, and down to the broth for the kimchee stew (chiggae) it was totally fresh.

Other reviews I've read have complained about portion size and lack of spice, but they seem to have improved on those fronts. I couldn't finish my portion and my kimchee chiggae was plenty spicy, and I like it hot! 

So, moral of the story: If you want a delicious meal that starts in Korea but goes beyond the same old same old, this is the place for you. If you want a budget meal and some comforting favourites, go to Koreatown instead."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Great ambiance and dishes marred by surly service. Oh, and avoid the overpriced swish (hot pot) bowls.

If it weren't for the poor interaction that kick-started the night, Swish would get a solid 3-star. The 2 of us were greeted by a surly server who told us it would be a 20 minute wait on a slow Tuesday night (by which I mean there were 2 empty reserved tables and an empty 4-person table). She also didn't seem impressed and gave me a dirty look when I inquired about sitting (and even sharing) at the open 4-person table. Even though we didn't feel very welcomed, we left our number anyway and headed out. We had barely walked up half the street (and about to go to Origin instead) when she called back saying our table was suddenly ready. The service, at least, remained neutral the rest of the night, though our server certainly didn't seem to be in the best of spirits. May I add that for the rest of the night, the 4-person table remained EMPTY! (I get it, you want to maximize seating and profit, but it's hard to justify that AND be snooty when half your resto is empty!)

I would recommend sharing a bunch of appetizers but avoiding their overpriced swish (hot pot) bowls - for $25 you only get 12 rolls of beef and a few slices of cabbage and bak choy, enoki mushrooms and king oyster mushrooms. If you want hot pot with more variety in soups, meats and veggies, I'd recommend going to China or Korean Town instead. 

The highlight of the night was the 48-hour braised beef served on a long stone platter lined with pickled veggies. With some added mustard seed on the side, this dish was refreshing with a good kick to it. We ordered their special of BBQ pork belly buns that was done in the style akin to Momofuku's in NYC (white taco-esque fluffy bun stuffed with BBQ pork belly) which is probably the best in the city (certainly way better than 416 Snack Bar), but just not as good as Momofuku - can't wait till David Chang opens up his 3-storey resto at the Shangri-La! The pork belly seemed a bit too charred and not tender enough. Their appies were clearly the highlights and would definitely come back and try their other offerings. 

Finally, they make some delicious soju-based cocktails and have a couple of beers on tap (Sapporo, Delirium Tremens, Erdinger, Oakenagen ale) that are all reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Swish By Han is a really nice place to meet up with friends if you are in the area. Reservation is a must since the dining room is really small and while I was there I saw even single diner got turned away.

Swish By Han food is Korean Asian Fusion meant to be shared tapas style. The portion here though is small, I would have ate everything by myself without sharing, but I was glad that my Yelp Beer Friend would able to join me for dinner last minute!

Soju Flights ($10) Regular, Citrus and Cucumber Infused was a nice start! The draft beer here was really reasonably priced $5.50 - $7.50 a pint. 

We shared:

- Warm Mushroom Salad ($12)
- 48 hour Braised Beef ($15)
- Grilled Pot Belly Ssam Set ($25) 

All the food we ordered was nicely seasoned and prepared. The grilled pot belly was really smokey and tender. As we were kind of fighting for the last piece of everything, it was definitely a sign that we enjoyed the food.

Service is good and friendly and we have no issue at all. The restaurant though is quite busy at times and with just 2 wait staff/bartender, it can be a little bit slow.

I will be back for some snack and drinks next time when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I purchased a voucher last year to try Swish by Hanbut never got around to it until recently. Given the fact that they had enforced a 20% + tips on our bill for two, I don't think I will ever return to this restaurant. I adore Korean cuisine but there is something about the server telling me not order something because the table has to be turned around by 7:15 when the restaurant was half emptied. I want to order what I want to eat. Isn't that what people do in restaurants?


Appetizer:

Torched Mackerel $15 (4.5/5)
The mackerel was marinated with rice wine. The server torched the mackerel at our table, I can smell the skin searing. The aroma was so intense! It is making me salivate just thinking about it! It was definitely sashimi graded Mackerel! The dish is severed with sweet soy sauce, grounded ginger and chopped green onion! It delicious and simple enough for me to duplicate at home!

Spicy Pork Neck Taco $10 (4/5)
For a low low cost of $10, you get two mini pork neck tacos. The flavor of the pork neck wasn't very strong. They give you two wedges of lime to add a hint of freshness to the dish. The tacos were a hand full! I would not recommend this dish if you are on a date. You will end up with very messy hands....it will be an added obstacle if you are trying to flirt with someone ;) The dish was structured well, but to be honest, I don't think it is worth the price.


Entree:
Beef Short Ribs: \"Galbi\" Marinate $29 (3.75/5)
This table top BBQ set is served with kimchi trio, spicy tofu stew, and ssam box. Ssam is referred to \"wrapped\" in English. Leaf vegetables are used to wrapped a piece of meat. The leaf vegetable tends to cut greasiness of the meat. The ssam is paired with ssamjang (a Korean style hot sauce) and a banchan (kimchi). It is served with a grill and is meant to be eaten fresh off the grill. I think the short ribs was marinated with a little too much rice wine. It actually added a slightly bitter undertone to the dish. The soup was very flavourful. You can taste the complexity of the broth. 

The overall experience was 3/5. I blame my frugal Chinese heritage. The server and the hidden gratuity had really ruined the our time at Swish by Han. Despite the fact that there were other dishes I am interested in trying on the menu, I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"OK, hold up. You're gonna charge me $20 for a bowl of four types of mushrooms and hot broth? Oh, and what the -- I have to cook it myself!? Outrageous. 

Decor is beautiful - softly lit by scores of huge cathedral-worthy candles and beautiful place settings.

Service is also excellent and friendly. 

But the price point is off by about $5-10. A vegetarian swish should not be only $5 less than the beef and seafood versions. The meat had to have been worth more than $5. Grossly overpriced.

I shared the veggie shabu shabu so it ended up costing \"only\" $10 but IMO even that was too expensive for mushrooms and broth. I'm not very adept with chopsticks and if you aren't either, this won't be the meal for you. I put on a brave face though and helped cook up the meal at the table. Many of the mushrooms were flimsy and even more difficult to pick up once they'd been cooked. The broth was nothing special so essentially at the end of it all I was just eating boiled mushrooms. I am not even that big of a mushroom fan to begin with.

This place had the makings of a great meal, but in the end (at least for vegetarians) it was just \"meh.\""}
{"text":"Wow, this place took me by surprise. I could not tell this place was a korean restaurant until I took a closer look. But don't be deceived, this place is good and i mean good.

I like the huge cool portrait of clay pots on the wall, probably for fermenting kim chi. And I definitely need to go back to try their interesting drinks I missed out on last time.

The one waiter during lunch wears a tuque. It is really cool. I don't know why, but everytime he opens his mouth to talk, English comes out. It surprised me every time."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Swish by Han for several years now, but it never happened until October when one of my friends wanted to have Thanksgiving dinner there. It was a strange choice for Thanksgiving dinner, but I was up to try it. 

Kimchi Trio ($5)
This kimchi trio came with a table top BBQ set that we ordered, but would've cost $5 without the combo. We're used to complimentary kimchi (and banchan) from traditional Korean restaurants so we certainly were not accustomed to paying for it. 

\"Bi Bim Bap\" Rolls ($7)
I didn't know what to expect, but the \"Bi Bim Bap\" roll was more like a spring roll in terms of terms of the flavours. I get the inspiration, but I wished more of the Bi Bim Bap flavours were incorporated.

Seafood crêpes ($10)
This was probably my favourite item of the night! The crêpe was delicious and satisfying. I wished I had more than just half of one.  

\"Kimchi\"ed pears with stilton cheese ($8)
In my head, I thought that the flavour combination of kimchi and pear would work well. That really wasn't the case, but on the whole it was a light, refreshing dish. 

Spicy pork neck tacos ($5)
The tacos were lauded by everyone as the best dish of the night, hands down. I cannot vouch for that as I did not try any (I was going through a no meat phase!), which was quite regrettable since it did look amazing. 

Lobster \"Bi Bim Bap\" ($15)
Unfortunately, I wasn't fast enough to snap a picture before our server started mixing the rice! I enjoyed the lobster \"bi bim bap\", but wanted a bigger portion. 

\"Saam\" box and spicy tofu stew
These two elements also came with Table Top BBQ set that we ordered. The tofu stew was rather disappointing and didn't taste very authentic.

Beef short ribs with \"Galbi\" marinade ($29)
Because I was on a no meat diet, I didn't try any of the meat. All I can say is that the portion was not very big. 

All in all, I found Swish by Han a little underwhelming. Even though there were some good things (seafood crêpe, pork neck taco), we weren't very impressed with the meal as a whole, and it left us with the desire to go to another Korean restaurant for a heartier meal!"}
{"text":"Have been to Swish twice. Overall good experience.

1) K-Food. You can tell the owners/cooks actually care about the quality and presentation of their dishes which, to me, is a breath of fresh air because many a times Korean restos dont bother too much with either or both of those important qualities.

2) Location. Strategically located at the border of the financial district so it's only a short walk from the office after work. However the resto is rather small and it gets crowded in there. With all the grills/shabua running, it gets so hot it could be slightly unpleasant. What's worse is to see your server sweating profusely =S.

3) Drinks. Have nice drink deals but they end so early in the evening many dont get to benefit from it. I guess it's a tactic to draw an earlier crowd. 

4) Service. Not bad as long as it doesnt get too hot in there else your server might be sweating bullets onto your food. The girls/guys are smiley and open to chat, if desired, which is nice. The owner is actually really cool.

5) Decor. Mix of new and old = modern yet enriched with the k-culture. Check out their painting over the cashier. It is painted by the owner's grandfather. Love the significance of it. The idea of having a piece of their family there with them every day is a really nice touch."}
{"text":"The place has a very modern urban feel to it.  For looks I would give it a 5 star.

I used my travel zoo voucher which costed me $30. It comes with two appertizers and a main dish which is suppose to have a value of $60? We chose the spicy pork bun and Spicy pork neck tacos as our appertizers. It was really tasty and flavorful. As our main we got the Table set bbq grill which is your typical korean bbq. Here was where it got disappointing. You only get 8 tiny pieces of meat and if you were to pay regular price this table set costs 29 bucks itself. So not worth it especially if you can pay 15 dollars for all you can eat at korean bbq places. Long review short the food is good but portions are small and not worth the price. If you don't mind the price and portion then for taste in food they get a 4 star.

Here is where they lost the majority of the stars. Customer service! Reviews don't lie. The caucasian girl who served us was actually sweet. But there was some next Korean girl who needs to learn how to smile and grow a personality. You look miserable! When we left they didn't even say bye.

If they're thinking of relocating to korean town for that price point good luck. People would rather go to a regular korean place already in korean town for cheaper price points and exceptional service."}
