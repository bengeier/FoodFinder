{"text":"We are out of towners here in the Toronto area for a family reunion. We stopped by to grab a quick lunch. I asked for a house special, and Imad-the owner-recommended his vienna chicken panini. The chicken was juicy and tender, and the caesar dressing in the sandwich added a nice compliment to the chicken. Imad checked on me to get my feedback. He is concerned with his customer's satisfaction. I highly recommend this cafe to all the locals. Great place for lunch. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Visiting friends in the sauga/oakville border and decided to try this spot out for a nice casual brunch... And boy was I in for a surprise. Meeting the owner Imad, I've never ever met such an inspiration of what hard work and dedication is. I had the Montreal smoked meat wrap and it was topped down to perfection not to mention the amazingly seasoned home fries. To accompany the amazing meal we had the company of a truly genuine owner. I definitely recommend this place to anything looking for a place to have breakfast, brunch or even lunch. 5 stars approval from me."}
{"text":"I went there for breakfast early in the morning, a lot of stuffs were not ready yet. We ordered home fries and they were not able to deliver. Finally got a sandwich with fried egg with mushroom, Swiss cheese, lettuce and tomato. It was generic, not very special. The price was average too."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast sandwiches, personable service. Great for early business meetings!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite lunch joint.  Healthy,  fresh,  fast.  It's like going to home for lunch!  Love the owner and his family!  They truly operate this family business from the heart and soul."}
{"text":"Out of a lot of items on the menu. No Nova Lox, no fruit for the fruit cup. Rivera panini had little meat and hard, crunchy, and thick bread. Otherwise it was good.  Mushroom soup was oversalted.   Pastrami sandwich tasted fine, but should have gone to Subway."}
{"text":"This has got to be my first review on any restaurant in 2 years since being a member. It well deserves the 5 stars as it served all my expectations.   My boyfriend & I happened to be in the Mississauga area & was hungry for breakfast that will hit the spot. He went on to yelp for some answers & stumbled upon the Olive Tree Delicafe.   As previous yelpers mentioned delicious sandwiches to try, I settled for the scrumptious Ruben Panini & the Italian Wedding Soup w/ light French vanilla coffee & My boyfriend chose the Montreal Smoked Meat Pita, home fries w/ Colombian coffee.   As we spoke to the owner, my bf & I mentioned to him that we found this little gem on Yelp & the reviews did its justice. He was very happy that everyone who had yelped was more than satisfied w/ his cafe & work of art. He mentioned that we made his day by showing him the great reviews about his store. And in returned my bf & I told him that he made our day by showing dedication & hard work into his dishes that we greatly enjoyed.   If anyone is ever in the area I highly recommend this place!! It is to die for! What are you waiting for?! GO ! GO! GO!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent - I had a marinated chicken sandwich and cream of broccoli soup! Toppings were fresh and chicken was cooked well. Service was fast and the staff were friendly. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, had the smoked turkey panini with roasted vegetables. The meat was your standard lunch meat but overall good panini. I ordered a Greek salad on the side all for about $10.   Service was quick and friendly. Nice little deli place for lunch. I'm leaning on a 3.5 star rating. It would have gotten a higher rating if the food wow'd me. It wasn't bad at all but wasnt great. It was exactly what I expected."}
{"text":"I work in the area and recently discovered Olive Tree Delicafe. I wanted something light and quick and this was the right place to go!   The service there is amazing. No matter how busy they are, they always have a smile on their face.   They have daily specials. The sandwiches and soups are always fresh - always made on demand. The Ruben sandwich and cream of broccoli combo is my favourite.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is a amazing.  The owner (Imad) is fantastic. He is there everyday and is usually the one who prepares the food. I have never seen someone put so much love into a sandwich.  He is attentive and a perfectionist.  The meat is sliced fresh for each sandwich and they makes big sandwiches. Makes great salads, fruit salad and soups, too.  I definitely recommend the Ruben or Philly Cheese Steak.  Deli-licious!  Absolutely fantastic. I come here a lot!"}
{"text":"Just another sandwich shop for me. Both my Roast Beef sandwich and my slightly spicy Thai soup were just Ok. Not what I expected after noticing all the glowing reviews for the spot close by the old AMC theatre.  I'll add a review for the Steve Carell movie Foxcatcher because it was so distasteful I would have walked if it was not -20 outside. The director and script writer have no idea of pace or timing. They created a cast of character no sane person could ever care about. Fill in some details! make care when misfortune befalls them!  As an example of the inanity of the script our protagonist is told to never talk to Dupont's (carrel's) wife if should run into her on the estate grounds. She does not show up on even one frame of film? huh? (apologies if I dozed off)."}
{"text":"What a great place! I hardly ever find myself in that area, so it took me a while to visit Olive Tree. I've been there 3 times already and each time I left with a full belly and a big smile. I definitely recommend this little gem.  Olive Tree is a mid-sized breakfast/brunch cafe with about 12-15 tables. The place is clean and bright and the staff is superb. No matter how busy it gets, you get your food promptly and the staff is always welcoming and friendly.   They offer a selection of sandwiches, paninis, soups, salads and pastries. They also have daily specials. Everything I've tried so far was delicious. I recommend the Vienna chicken panini with Greek salad or mushroom soup. Yum!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here first time was decent but then the second time I ordered the philly cheese steak and it's by far the best one I have ever tried, the meat was so tender and thin bread bin was perfect and the veggies on it also. 5 stars for that and amazing service."}
{"text":"This is a great little sandwich place. The vibe is fresh, and cozy. Definitely will swing back if I get the hankering for a sandwich and I'm in the area.  Chicago Panini on Corn Muffaletta: The way a panini should be. Beautiful presentation. Satisfying and homey.  Marinated chicken breast on Greek salad with roasted vegetables: The chicken breast is super moist. A little bit heavy on the dressing though."}
