{"text":"Wow, where to begin.

We had a reservation for 15. At 7pm, the time of the reservation, all but 4 were there. At 7:15pm, still not knowing who the waitress was, having a drink in hand, or offered any appetizer, the rest of the group arrived. There weren't enough places at the table for everyone so we moved the 4-top empty table next to us to accomodate our group. This was when we met the waitress.

Jennifer, the waitress, yelled at our group for moving the table. This was done in front of all of the other diners and was directed at the couple and their two kids. She said the reservation was for only 15...well Jennifer, eleven plus 4 equals 15. After yelling at us and moving the table back, she disappeared again. Still, no drinks, no introduction letting us know she was going to be our waitress....It was actually beyond surreal. Never, ever yell at customers...can you imagine how that made everyone feel. As one who has worked in the industry many years I can tell you she would have been fired on the spot if I was managing. 

I ended up going up to the bar to get a beer as she still hadn't come to our table other than to yell. 

Food: Extremely cold steak sandwich. She took it back and came out and said I was right that she felt it and that it was cold. Would she like them to put it back on the grill or make a new one. Well Jennifer, I am glad to know that you didn't trust me when I said it was cold but then knowing you 'felt it' and verified it was cold, why would I want a sandwich that you felt up? 

It has been weeks since this occurred and I am still angry over it. I grew up in this area and Dinos had a great reputation. It is too bad this institution for the neighborhood has gone so downhill. Also a note, everytime I went outside for a smoke, the waitresses busser was on her phone smoking cigarettes....somewhat crazy considering it was during peak hours and according to Jennifer they were slammed. 

A place is only as good as their worst employee and I would assume I found her otherwise this place couldn't possibly be in business."}
{"text":"Great family style Italian food. Homemade spaghetti and cavatelli are my favorites. Eggplant parm is great too. Nice friendly service."}
{"text":"I actually order take out from here all the time and the food is great! I love the Chicken Piccata can't say enough!"}
{"text":"love dino's. we go there frequently. great food, good service, very accommodating. awesome wedding soup and excellent chicken and veal parm! their pizza is one of the best around! terrific, fresh rolls and great salads with cheese. good dressing too. as far as desserts go, their hoho cake rules! cant compare! love the atmosphere and forgot to mention how good the fried mozz app is!"}
{"text":"Great food and service at bar!!!!
Really cool vibe at the bar on some nights.. it's like a blast from the past!"}
{"text":"We went  there for the Friday fish fry.  Both ordered the fish with a cup of clam chowder.  The clam chowder was bad.  It was thin, grey colored and very salty.  The fish lunch was terrible, the breading was thicker then the fish.  The only thing that was good was the french fries.  Never going back for the fish."}
{"text":"Don't let the negative reviews you see here thwart you from going to Dino's.  You don't go to Dino's for a steak sandwich or a fish fry, you go for the Italian food.

Dino's has the best Italian Wedding Soup, I honestly can't think of anywhere else that competes.  Their sauce is delicious, and any plate with meat (Chicken/Veal Parm) comes in big helpings.  Everything is reasonably priced and the service is personable and welcoming.  

One other thing -  there's just something about the dinner rolls.  Be sure to ask your waitress for extra, you'll be needing them!"}
{"text":"Two times we have eaten here and I still have nothing bad to say. Food and Service was fast and delicious. Very kind feeling there."}
{"text":"This place has lost its food quality! The place looks dark and dirty and the service was sad."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years.....last 2 visits the food has really taken a dive.  Sent calamari back because it came cold and the first bite was rubbery.   Veal. Parmigiana was really awful......best part both times were the fresh rolls.  Sad......."}
{"text":"Contrary to a lot of the negative reviews regarding service here, the waitress was ok enough. We got drink refills fast enough. 

We were seated smack dab in the middle of the bar right next to a speaker (two adults, two kids). The restaurant was basically empty. First mistake. 

The cheeseburger bun was toasted SOLID. I mean it looked BURNT and could have hurt someone if thrown the correct way.....again the restaurant was all but empty....not busy. The fettuccini alfredo was actually spat out it was so gross. Another tried it and found the same displeasure. Disgusting. Watery. Not alfredo. The chicken marsala was just below ok. I ate that and didn't die...let's put it that way. 

Eff this place. I guess I shouldn;t have expected much next to a trailer park."}
{"text":"This is my go to Italian restaurant. The only reason I'm not giving them five stars is their atmosphere. It's a small family owned ordeal so it's comfortable but bland. 

I have been here numerous times and have never been disappointed with the food or the service. The chicken piccata should not be missed but I will say that if you don't eat it right away it can get soggy but it's still awesome even then. They also have some of the best lasagne and chicken parm around. 

The best deal is to get a combination dinner for around $16 and you can choose two entrees at a slightly reduced portion size (i.e: 2 pieces of chicken piccata instead of 3) but it still comes with a side of penne, a salad and roll PLUS your other entree. You cannot eat all this but you'll try. 
Every time."}
{"text":"My goto local Italian spot. The prices are fair & generally always have some type of special going on. Every time I go there I get the chicken Parmesan or chicken Marsala, w/a side of pasta(meat sauce). Very consistent & they have big servings. I recommend this place for a good meal & the service is par."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE hometown restaurant!  I stop here every time I visit my family.  Our favorites are the shrimp scampi, chicken piccata and the fettuccine alfredo.  You can't go wrong with any of those, but really, everything is good there!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday in December for lunch.  The Eggplant is EXCELLENT!!  G didn't have much luck.  Pizza will take xx minutes, then they were out of his next choice.  Finally, he got a burger.  With all that, we will return.  I love that eggplant!!  Also, sauce is good.  Not all sauce is created equal."}
{"text":"Eggplant and Veal Cutlets were very good and orders big enough for some take home. spaghetti was fair, a little soggy and marinara sauce was fair. Service was excellent, prices same as other Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"Where to begin? I'm not sure what happened here with our visit to Dino's. Our waitress seemed to be annoyed with something, maybe life itself, I'm not sure. I presented 2 birthday coupons, which were sent to us from them for a free meal, up to $13 value each. I wanted to double check with her that they were okay to use for lunch time. So, sure, no problem. Our party of 3 were super courteous and not demanding, so I'm stumped. 

We ordered the spinach & artichoke appetizer, which was some of the best I've ever had. That arrived quickly. Our entrees, however, that's another story. We noticed that 5 (yes, 5!) tables that came in long after us ALL got served before we did. Like, we weren't a part of the \"club\". It was a solid 40+ mins before we were served our entrees. It wasn't too awfully busy. Someone forgot about us or that they just didn't give a damn because of said coupons. Our waitress also didn't clear our table, let dirty plates stack up and could care less about drink refills. Wow! 

It's a shame, too, because the food was excellent. However, we did nothing to warrant that kind of lackluster service. I hope they're happy to know that we will never go back there again. It's really sad, too, you'd think that a restaurant that's been going since 1978 would have their act together by now. I'll be sure to let others in the local Italian community know about it, as well. Save that treatment for some SOB who deserves it, not us."}
{"text":"Great old place to eat love love the chicken piccata  with red just can't tell you how good it is it is a must go"}
{"text":"Love the piccata and the Friday fish fry is the best in town lightly breaded not greasy at all. You can't beat the combo platters"}
{"text":"Chicken Parm is great, their rolls are probably addictive and the Friday Clam Chowder .... Ambrosia!  My only negative is that they need to drain the spaghetti better before putting it on the plate.  Puddle of water under the pasta.   Service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Went to Dino's tonight with the family and the in laws. We were sat right away even though we didn't have reservations and they were fairly busy. Rolls , huge rolls were waiting at our table for us ! The server came over right away and took are drink order. We all new what we wanted and also out our order in. The food came out perfectly cooked and smelled delicious. There sauce is amazing and is one of the best gems on the east side for Italian food. We will go here over Olive Garden and bravo any day"}
{"text":"9/23/2015 We went to Dino's restaurant, sat at a table in the bar area, gave our order to Kathy, who by her own admission, work there for at least 10-15 years and Lucio's 10 years, So 20-25 years experience as a waitress. After only arriving about 10 minutes she hands my drink to me but dumps it all over my brand new silk blouse, new slacks, and soaks my socks with diet soda.  She got a rag wiped my chair, part of the table and I took napkins that came with the meal to partially dry my clothes.  I work third shift, I just took a shower, and I had only 2 hours until I had to work again.  We planned to eat at Dino's for a week.  No time to go any where else for a meal in that area. The she gave me a sink rag to dry my seat.  Rude start honestly.  Pretty angry.  We ordered dinner salads, two drinks and a pizza.  $34.31 in total.  Here comes the bill.  Full price.  Being she just ruined my clothes, most restaurants have help that get the manager, and make an accommodation for the bad service.  Not Kathy, apologized but here's a full price dinner for both my husband and I.  Either the management doesn't give a crap about their customers or Kathy or both??  First, no tip, obviously.  Never going there again.  My husband started out his first job there in East Cleveland, loyal to that restaurant and other friends and family.  We'll they went out of business in Mentor so far, with service like Kathy gave she will run others away also.  Or receipt number is #00184 9/23/2015 4:36 PM.  Kathy get a new job and Owners be on a look out for bad service.  It ruins a business.  I will be calling the owner.  Waited a few days until my rage calms down.

Well the owner a few weeks after this wrote me a very nice letter apologizing,  he also paid for our meals and even my new clothes that were damaged.  I couldn't ask for a better response.  Obviously he care very much for his business and customers.  I am grateful for his response. I will give that restaurant a strong recommendation."}
{"text":"Excellence!!! I'm based in Seattle where excellent/inexpensive Italian food is as rare a sunny day in February, therefore, this Cleveland gem was a true treat! From the family atmosphere to the homemade marinara, Dino's was IT!!! I got the Chicken Parm sub, which is as hard to find in Seattle as a good Mayoral decision! 

The sub came with delicately thin breaded slices of tender chicken carved with the alacrity of a chisel wielded by Michaelangelo himself.  The sauce complemented without overpowering, but included a side of peppers to slake your spicier taste!

This is a must!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great classical Italian restaurant. You can't beat the food in the portions for the price. I had the surf and turf it was cooked perfectly. They just redid their bathrooms and they are beautiful. This is the number one Italian restaurant to come to in this area."}
{"text":"I use to love this place. Now it is about a 3.5 star. I still recommend this place because of the food taste. Their homemade cavatelli and meat sauce, and their Chicken Parmesan are usually (but not always) delicious. I always get my food to go, because it feels less like an Italian restaurant and more like a bar. The prices are kind of high and the quality is sometimes hit or miss. I still order the family packs to go about once a month. It use to include a loaf of Italian bread and a good size salad, but now they give a smallish container of salad mix from a bag and a few rolls. If you want to add cheese, they charge and extra $4.00 and only give you a handful of it, better to buy a bag of mozzarella and add it to the salad yourself."}
{"text":"Had a open face steak sandwich. It was good but part of the reason is I was really hungry as well. But I will give it to them they did a good job getting the steak right. Cole slaw was not bad either. Good for a work lunch."}
{"text":"Service was horrible food was overcooked and overpriced. Make the trip to little italy."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Went here for dinner last night with 13 people. The staff was awesome. The food was great. Chicken parm Monday night special $10.95 one meal was enough to feed two. The side salad that comes with dinner mmmmm. The best. This place is great. Real Italian and really really good!"}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall spot. Was the first of a group to arrive for dinner so I parked it at the ample bar space, which is to the left when you walk in. I ordered the house Cabernet and sat next to a lovely couple that highly recommended the chicken piccata as well as the homemade cavatelli. They come here once a week and live about 20 miles away but raved about the quality of food. 

The group arrived and we sat in the dining area as opposed to the bar. This side was sparse for a Tuesday night but the bar was fairly full (including booths). I ordered the salmon with the homemade cavatelli. Portions were sizeable and the quality was fairly good. Others in the group ordered the chicken piccata and shrimp scampi. They left with clean plates. The real winner here was the chocolate ho-ho cake. That is: a light chocolate cake with a riccotta(?) style cream layer at the bottom, topped with chocolate syrup and whipped cream. Delicious. Overall Dino's is an easy going neighborhood Italian joint where you can expect to clean your plate. Much enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Food was nothing special I had the veal parmigiana which was very tough and not tender. The sauce however was good overall the meal was average."}
{"text":"I'm very picky when it comes to my pasta. Growing up Italian, I know when my cavatelli is cooked right and if my sauce is too sweet. This place always gets it right. If you're looking for real Italian food, you found the right place."}
{"text":"The service sucks, their prices have gotten ridiculous, and all the people that work that have shitty attitudes!  I sent back an order and the waitress was appalled that I didn't like the mussels.  They smelled overly fishy and were bland.  Boycotting for sure.  They use to be a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Very good classic Italian. Almost always too busy to risk stopping in the weekends. When we have stopped, we've really enjoyed it! The service is friendly and well paced."}
{"text":"When we first came they took a long time to get us our bread, but when the table across from us came 10 minutes after we had they had gotten served right away. We still hadn't been served yet. Then when we ordered they messed up the half cheese, half pepperoni pizza. Made it half pepperoni-sausage, half pepperoni. I don't like pepperoni or sausage, I've been vegetarian for two years straight. My brothers ravioli was room temp. and the room wasn't very warm. The complimentary mints were absolutely terrible, I didn't even want them and they were free. I'm still waiting for small cheese pizza. Later, yelpies."}
{"text":"Food is good, place is dated and the wait staff makes you feel like you're an inconvenience. Went in tonight and waited 45 minutes for food. Server didn't care or even offer an apology. Instead when the food came just slapped it down and went away. Table behind us also had complaints after waiting 25 min for an app. We won't be back, we can get good Italian food elsewhere and not be treated like the red headed stepchildren."}
{"text":"Don't fool yourself with a lot of these wannabe Italian restaurants this is the real deal. I've been eating here about 29 years and the food is the same quality. I don't live on the East side no more but I traveled 45 mins to enjoy this goodness. The inside is casual and cozy with the old school charm a mixture of old and new which makes it appealing to the folks that use the term dated . Very nice simple restaurant with great food ! I must say my personal favorite is the Veal Parm, and the sausage and peppers for an appetizer. The chicken Piccata is to die for. Also the pizza is excellent, and the Spaghetti and meatballs with a nice house salad with cheese with their house made Italian dressing. Pasta is homemade and they provide catering for any occasion! Kudos Dino's 3 always a treat!"}
{"text":"I was planning my dad's birthday dinner and out of all the restaurants in Cleveland area, he chose Dino's! I was a bit surprised, hadn't been to this location in quite some time, but it was still VERY good all these years later. 

I had the Chicken Marsala with side of spaghetti - love the sauce, everything was delicious. My dad got the steak and shrimp scampi special which he really enjoyed. Eggplant parmesan and chicken piccata are also very good. Prices are reasonable for the portions you get. 

The dining area is small, but they also have a small bar on other side that offers seating as well. It's very cozy in there. Waitress and hostess were very friendly. 

Definitely recommend for some classic Italian food!"}
{"text":"Another drawn out, wonderful Italian experience.  the homemade pasta, the sausage and peppers app.  I wished I lived next door..."}
{"text":"Decent eat and decent ambiance... think of it as your Granny's Cottage in Ohio (I wonder how many Wickliffe locals are thinking, \"What a FOB!\" right now)

Another quick note: I love that historic look of the homes out here.. don't get much of that in So Cali! (FOB)

Okay, so back to the eats.  It's cute that Dino's has comforting lunch specials that are distinct for each day of the week, but what caught my eye was the steak burger... it was actually one of the few items that appealed to me.

The burger came out quick which is just what you need when you're on lunch hour. The burger wasn't the best I've had by any means, but the soft buns and provolone cheese made each bite very good.
 
The fries that accompanied the slab were crisp and salted well.

I ordered a side Cesar but the sauce was more Italian/Vinaigrette than anything close to cesar. 

The iceberg was drenched... SWIMMING in dressing.  I didn't bother asking our server to take it back because she was so sweet and frankly, I'm a baller like that--I make it rain, I make it RAIN!

Anyways, I brushed aside the excess and took a few bites... I finished about 15% of the salad before the ratio of 100:1 dressing:lettuce was unavoidable

All in all Dino's is a good dining experience ONCE in a while... Despite all the positives in ambiance and service I still wouldn't prioritize it on my list of must-eats when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Dino's is always a stop when I'm in the area. Their meatballs put moms to shame and won't disappoint. Really big portions so you'll have plenty of leftovers for a couple meals."}
