{"text":"Stay well away from this one, not worth going to for even a cup of coffee. Service was very slow (despite three servers, and a less then half full restaurant) and food was awful. We just stopped for a snack after walking the gallery, so ordered a cup of coffee and a cheeseboard to share. Coffee came, was nearly cold (despite just being poured) and the cup came on a plate that was so dirty it would not be passable at a Tim Horton's, let alone a relatively pricey cafe. The cheeseboard was horrible, tasted like a selection of flavourless Kraft grocery store cheeses, not \"Artisan Quebec Cheeses\" as the menu claimed. Came with about 8 crackers, and bread that was so stale it was rock hard and unusable. Bread had some sort of balsamic on it, but had not been freshly poured, it had been done so long ago it was completely dry. Everything felt extremely cheap, and at a premium price. Left feeling ripped off and wondering why such a great gallery allows this place to run on their grounds. Do yourself a favour and avoid this place, just walk from the gallery into Kleinburg for something."}
{"text":"It's not like you have many options for a snack unless you leave the McMichael gallery, but I recommend you do. Leave, I mean. 

Service was sloppy, and the servers seemed stressed and unsmiling which is odd considering there were four of them for only 15 tables. Food was meh. I had the green pea soup which was so salty, no other flavours could be discerned and the salmon on my husband's salad was overcooked. 

Next time we're at the McMichael, we'll go back to the Doctor's House where we'll get better food and service for not much more money."}
{"text":"awful place..cappuccino was served almost cold, no napkins, profiteroles were obviously frozen and storebought, however the waitress argued with me and said they were made fresh and stored in the fridge..they were obviously frozen. Service was slow and the waitress was shuffling around like she didn't want to be there. If i could give less than one star, I would. This place gives Toronto and McMichael a VERY bad name...i would be ashamed to take any of our European guests there."}
{"text":"The cafe called cashew & clive is forgetful and I would say stay away from it. The cappuccino I ordered was weak and fellow diners drinks/desserts were poor. 
Even the drip coffee was poor.   
The muffins could have been from a generic store in addition the prices were surprising with a salad costing in the teens. The wine selection was bleh as well so I wouldn't  recommend trying those as well
Service was not good as well but I guess one doesn't come here for food or drinks but I guess they can still use an improvement. The only good thing is an outdoor seating area where one can enjoy the sun and relax.
Here is the verdict for the capp
Here is the verdict for the cappuccino
Espresso: Mild
Crema': below average 
Milk: very poorly frothed
Latte Art: Non existent
I can safely say a fully automatic machine can do a better job than the drink that was served."}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if I could. Sandwich selection was limited to Roast Beef which was drier than the Saraha. I asked for condiments (mayo, mustard...) was told no...we only have butter. Prices are ridiculously high, $3.50 for a small bottle of water. Only go here if you are starving and desperate."}
{"text":"Took advantage of a non-Mother's Day date to enjoy the Aura restaurant in the McMichael gallery in Kleinburg.

Wise decision indeed! I had made the reservation but likely wouldn't have needed it - it was that nice and quiet being there before the mad rush of Mother's Day High Tea. Not to mention, no $40/head price tag, for a selection of items that, in hindsight, would have included nothing like the lovely items we were able to order a la carte instead.

We were able to get a window-side table, which is always nice. Our server was quite attentive, and very polite. The restaurant manager was very friendly and forthcoming with chit chat about the restaurant's offerings, and other tidbits for travelers in and around the GTA.

The savoury food menu items were all (so far as I could tell, to verify what the menu says about local ingredients) either right off the McMichael grounds, or very local - a nice touch for the gallery that is the permanent home of Canada's largest Group of Seven collection. For a savoury, we ordered a spinach quesadilla which was a local version of the Mexican standard - a spinach tortilla, filled with pears, (brie? something of the like if not exactly), and fresh arugula. It was grilled, and nicely sliced and presented on a pretty rectangular plate garnished with cherry tomatoes and fresh arugula. The fresh pear, arugula, and cherry tomatoes were indeed very fresh, very tasty, very believably right off the land you can see out the window as you eat. As for the spinach tortilla, well, it made it barely par for the course you would expect, as based on the very artfully done marketing of the dining area. The dining area is right off the main entrance, so not the airy yet cozy room you might think by looking at the pictures on the website. Also, while I drooled over the gorgeous yet utilitarian cutlery, something did tell me that the glasses, while very nice, totally made me think, \"Ikea\"? And sure enough - yes! Ikea glasses in the \"elegantly upscale dining room\" you'd expect from the pictures. So, while the dining room is nice when it's quiet and you get a window seat, it most likely is not going to live up to what you'd expect from looking at the website photos. And so, the quesadilla is par for the experience you would expect once you're in the somewhat disappointing dining room.

On the other hand - the desserts were OFF THE CHART. We ordered apple cake and a chocolate mousse, a.k.a. a Baked Harvest, and a Black and White. WOW! Now these items, these were the upscale eatery delights you would expect from the marketing. Hence, these got the photos deemed worthy of taking to go with this review. The Black and White's beautiful maple syrup tulle topper is just as tasty as it is beautiful, because you can tell - its delicate yet sweet flavour is from the maple syrup made right from the premises (by a very talented pastry chef, who makes those for the house dessert). And the Baked Harvest? When I heard it's an apple cake, well, I almost missed this cake by my own bias! Am I ever glad we got it anyway, because it was out of this world as far as I could ever imagine some apple cake being able to go! Not to mention, again, it was topped by a beautiful piece of tasty sugar artistry, worthy of the gallery and the view. The crispy crust, the fresh apple, the fresh whipped cream ... WOOT!

I told the staff, they should market this place as a speed dating dessert set up, because that's how worth it, it is to come here only for dessert. They serve tea by the bag and frankly I forget which brand it is, it's about as good as a David's tea bag and comes in a good array of flavours. We had the vanilla something or other to go with the desserts.

All in all, definitely glad we came when we did, and got what we ordered. If the savoury items were as good as the desserts, I don't know if I'd still care that the photos set the place up for a bit of \"ambiance disappointment\"! Knowing what we know now, and what you can expect, we'll definitely make a point to come back whenever we can."}
{"text":"Yup I was starving after long walk outside the gallery all afternoon. I really didn't wish to something full scale, so ordered the combo deal, served with a half portion sandwich and a soup of the day. Pretty much all the time, I crave for Asian soup over the western largely because western soup being conceived as an appetiser. Well, not here. Soup and the sandwich was totally good enough to go through the rest of the night and I find the portion just right. Fine, I'll be honest, I should've ordered coffee too, I had to drive another 2 hours after leaving the gallery. Croque-Madame is my go-to sandwich because I don't see such combination in anywhere else-!"}
{"text":"This cafe is located in one of the finest museums I've ever visited. So why do they support this terrible cafe? I went today with my partner and his cousin. The service was extremely slow and it wasnt particularly busy.  I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with roasted beets, spinach and cheese. The waitress brought me a chicken sandwich. I sent it back and when I finally got it after everyone was almost finished, I took a bite and instead of beets, I found something like a thinly sliced potato. It turned out to be thinly sliced, crunchy, flavorless pear. I called the waitress and told her that it was supposed to have beets and she just said that they were out and put the pear in instead. I told her she should have asked me if I still wanted it before she brought it out.  Anyway, all three dishes sucked, my cousin's kale salad had gritty sand or dirt in it. Nothing had any flavor. The desserts were creme brule (boring) and the cream cheese brownie was hard and flavorless. Enjoy the great museum but do not eat here."}
{"text":"This cafe is located inside the McMichael Art Collection gallery, and in fact, are dining in the open lobby. The service was prompt and friendly.

The menu consists of soup, soup & sandwich, quiche, a nice selection of both salads and sandwiches from which to choose, 2 desert options (I hardly ever pay attention), and due to the 50th anniversary, some choice starters with a 50th twist (i.e. original 1960 recipe and selectively updated). I do recall one dish from 3 starters: beef bourguignon. Frankly, I skipped through that section too!

I had the soup & sandwich option and it was a more than enough to tidy you over for a late dinner. The soup was pureed squash & potato; I accompanied it with the rosemary caper chicken sandwich (1/2 baguette). The spread was generously spread on the sandwich so I had to ask for more napkins! It was delicious.

I decided to have a glass of Cdn wine, whose portion of the proceeds are donated back to the gallery, for lunch. It was all around a delightful gallery meal. After all, there is nothing else around! So I am truly relieved the meal and menu are amenable!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a lower star rating then 1*  I would!! Not because of their food (which I didn't try) but because they charged $3.50 for a bottle of WATER!!! They aught to be ashamed of themselves for charging this amount!! This is the definition of \"PROFITEERING\"!! To make 300% profit on a product is unconscionable!!"}
{"text":"Oh Aura how I wanted to love you.  The food was good however the space left a lot to be desired.  

I had a glass of Pinot Grigio and the Crepe w Smoked Salmon.  My main squeeze had the soup, the quiche and a glass of chardonnay.

Food was tasty but not hot.... and the restaurant was not busy. Tasted good but quite average.  

A few rhetorical questions?

1) why have Reserved signs on tables in an empty restaurant? Weird.
2) the space is quite echoey and would benefit from some music or nature sounds or something. Anything.
3) the space needs additional lighting to warm things up. 
4) it would be great to segregate the space from the main admittance desk.  Instead of the really lame sparse arrangements I recommend tall birch cuts - that's all - to create a separate space.  The table top arrangements were not good - a candle or some herbs something alive.
5) tables and chairs are very utilitarian - warming up the space would go a long way.

Good luck."}
{"text":"Medicore food, medicore service. McMichael once had a nice restaurant, but this management has lowered the place substantially.  The view out the window is great, but not at the cost of our digestion."}
