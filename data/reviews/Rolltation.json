{"text":"I love Rolltation! Whenever I have a craving for sushi burritos or sushi, Rolltation on Yonge is my go-to. The staff here are friendly and attentive. I always get a custom order because frankly I don't like their \"set\" combinations, and the Yonge location matches it to a T! The store is clean and has a decent amount of seating, great to hang with a small group of friends. Food is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"DON\"T GIVE THEM YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER!!  I tried to use their online ordering and it didn't work.  It kept asking for my postal code even though it was a pick up and even though I supplied it the order would not go through.  So I gave up and went somewhere else for lunch.  Shockingly, I found 3 mysterious charges on my credit card from them.  I have been trying to get a refund since May 9th and nothing, they keep saying they will send it but they never do.  I've changed my credit card number because I am afraid they will keep charging me.  Horrific experience that is still on going!   If you bother going here pay cash! Trust me."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre but what was a major turnoff was the customer service. The staff made it very obvious that she was annoyed and didn't even bother hiding her facial expression when we were trying to decide on the toppings for our customized poke bowls. I mean why bother having a build your own option if that's the service you are going to provide?"}
{"text":"First time trying a sushi burrito. I am impressed.  I had the make your own roll - which includes salmon or tuna, pick your own 3 fillings and 3 toppings, and sauce. For ~$14 tax in.  What I like:  - Big variety of optional ingredients that are unique (eg tangerines, mango, sweet potato). Ingredients that I would never have thought would go so nicely with the sushi. - A big burrito stuffed to the gills with salmon and other ingredients, and not much rice.  - Good portion of salmon - Huge roll. They cut it in half for you, so good for two people if you are not too hungry. - Friendly service  Dislikes: - Big lineup at lunch - 4 tiny seats, small space - $14-$15 each, not the cheapest meal in town - The burrito was so stuffed with ingredients I don't know how they close it. But there is a tiny gap on the side that gets bigger as you eat your burrito. Finally, towards the end, the gap gets so big it all falls apart. To be fair, I tried the sushi burrito food truck and theirs have the exact same issue of the burrito falling apart. The only solution would be bigger piece of seaweed paper or less filling."}
{"text":"Really good sushi burrito. Probably my favourite one in Toronto so far. They give you a good quantity of stuffings. And the sauces taste great!"}
{"text":"This was a really great find! I absolutely adored the layout and the look! The neon signs and menus are definitely very Instagramable! For the service, the staff were very friendly and kind. Your meal is made in front of you so you can see how they do it, therefore the service is quite fast and no hold ups except during rush hour around lunch (long line). The food it's self is great! I would recommend the chicken or beef with sriracha mayo! From mango to shrimp they have lots of different options. Very creative. The only thing is is that they are very big so definitely take it home for left overs if you can!! It also helps that this is in an area near the movie theatre so you can grab some filling food before you catch a film. Would for sure recommend."}
{"text":"I tried the signature salmon burrito. It didn't really blow my socks off, and certainly not worth the hype. It was very average. I didn't really like some of the ingredients like oranges which I felt really just made it soggy. I"}
{"text":"Got the salmon poke bowl on 2 occasions. They had kale in the bowl the first time, and 2 months later they changed it to lettuce (boo).  Not enough salmon in the bowl though :("}
{"text":"My friend and I split the Classic Salmon Sushi Burrito which came to around $15. It was my first time having a sushi burrito, and it will definitely be hard to beat! The roll was packed with a large amount of salmon and this signature roll had a great combination of flavours with sweet corn, red onion, tangerine and more. I am personally not a fan of tangerine, however the flavour blended in so smoothly that I did not even notice it was there.  I originally thought that $15 was pretty steep for a burrito, but for the amount of meat that was inside, I think it is a very fair price. In addition, they are fairly large so splitting one is always an option. Overall I would definitely recommend trying out a sushi burrito once in your life, but I am not sure it is something I will go back to in the future. Although it was a great taste, I would much rather get actual sushi or sashimi for the price.  One thing to note is that this location has VERY limited seating with only 4 seats at the bar so don't expect to order and eat it there!"}
{"text":"Rollation is a sushi burrito and poke bowl (and salad) joint that is mostly focused on take out. They have a bench with 4 seats but their main target is a grab and go lunch. Although the food is pretty good, their prices are on the higher side and service could improve.  I got a \"make your own\" poke bowl with salmon and tuna. I added jicama, edamame (the little that they had left), cucumber, avocado, Kani salad, masago, unagi sauce and furikake.  The person making my food got my order wrong and when I corrected him he gave me attitude until he realized his mistake. They were also out of a few ingredients I had wanted.  The food was pretty good, and definitely filling. I would definitely recommend going for a poke bowl over a sushi burrito. When I saw the burritos they looked relatively small (I've gotten bigger ones from food trucks).  Overall, my experience here was alright. It's a bit expensive for what it is, and the service could be better.    Update: after returning multiple times, I can vouch for Rolltation, as they have consistently produced great food with quick service. It has become one of my go to lunch spots."}
{"text":"This is a pretty small shop and as soon as I walked in, I was greater by 4 cheery workers. Since the store is small, there isn't much space to sit. There are only 5 chairs. (Pretty much every other shop in downtown). They made the burritos super quick. Service was quick too. The burritos are expensive like they are everywhere else but they are absolutely worth it. They taste amazing and they are very filling. The whole burrito was great every bite but it falls apart super easily. I would definitely recommend coming here but just be prepared to take one to go due to the lack of seating."}
{"text":"Completely worth every penny! You can think of it like a cross between chipotle and sushi. You can get a bowl or a burrito and either are great. I really like the classic salmon and my girlfriend really likes the Terri shrimp with chicken instead of shrimp. You really can't go wrong with this place. Good food, good service, okay prices, and very flexible on orders!"}
{"text":"I came here close to closing on Valentine's Day night with my boyfriend. The decor is really hip, and there were maybe 3 other people eating at the time. The staff welcomed us as good as it gets an hour before closing, but were friendly when giving us time since it was our first sushi burrito experience. We decided on the Classic Salmon and Kimchi Beef. The menu is really helpful for dietary restrictions in that they include common questioned foods on the back (which I really appreciate!). The price is fair considering the portion size and the ingredients, and the taste wasn't too bad either (we prefer the salmon sushi over the kimchi beef any day). They are actually quite filling so be hungry when you get there. Also, seaweed wrap can get a bit chewy so expect a bit of messy eating. Overall, the location is really convenient, you get what you pay for, and online ordering is also a bonus."}
{"text":"Really small place with only around 4/5 seats. Was lucky enough to get 2 seats for me and my friend. We each ordered a roll. Their menu is nicely layed out on the wall which is easily seen as you walk in with all the ingredients listed. I ordered the salmon burrito and it was very good. I thought the tangerine would be quite weird in the roll but ended giving a very nice addition of sweetness to the roll. All the ingredients were very fresh and it had a thin layer of rice which was really nice. Would definitely go again, hopefully to get seats again!"}
{"text":"Love it! Healthy and delicious. Pricey for fast food but so tasty! Salmon is my favourite."}
{"text":"Off to a good start, the rolls were big, build your own option is the way to go. Tons of options, friendly staff, very little seating and they need to improve the roll of the sushi burrito to ensure its actually closed. Overall very good experience and I will return to build more sushi burritos very soon"}
{"text":"Very fresh & delicious! The employees were fast and extremely kind! Had a build your own burrito and it did not disappoint! I am very happy with this place and will go back 100%!"}
{"text":"After trying the burrito with my roommate, both of us came to the same conclusion that rolltation's sushi burrito is only a novelty.  Taste wise: I ordered the wasabi classic salmon burrito with wasabi mayo. There is a big pile of wasabi mayo in the burrito. Not only was the wasabi mayo super strong and overpowering, it also made the burrito very soggy.   The size of the burrito was small for the price they charged. If I am charged over $16 at a walk in place, I at least expect the portion size to be good. However, this is not the case with rolltation. When you can just get a bigger burrito from burrito boyz, or better raw fish foods at sushi house right beside rolltation, I see no appeal in what rolltation has to offer. Not to mention your bill would also be cheaper if you went to the other two places.  I will not recommend this place to anyone, but everyone deserves to try everything once, but after that please stay away!!!"}
{"text":"Happy to hear about a sushi burrito place come to the Young and Eligible area.  When I first checked out the menu and prices, I was like Holy Bejesus but after having a burrito I wasnt disppointed. I barely finished my burrito, it was equivalent to eating 3-4 maki rolls.  Ive been there twice since my review and Ive had the salmon and tuna rolltation burritos. Both were different from each other and had their own unique flavours. I did favour the salmon just slightly.  Staff are very friendly and are not shy with the ingredients for your burrito.  I definitely will be back to try the other burritos."}
{"text":"Really tasty burritos, fresh soft fish and perfect avocado! The service is great too. They were patient enough to explain the menu to my newcomer self. I love the corn on the Salmon burrito"}
{"text":"Small location that serves fresh ingredients. Seems overvalued due to higher cost in comparison to other poke places. Their poke isn't traditional as in it isn't seasoned but rather you add sauce for additional flavour. Four seats total so it's more of a grab and go place. Large sizes just have double the protein, serving size was small overall."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy salmon roll, I really enjoyed it. The only bad thing is that it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Pricey but good.  The good stuff: Plenty of variation  Good flavour combinations Takoyaki is amazing, recommend trying this! Modern/trendy  The not so good stuff: Pricey Not enough space / crowded Hectic (this was a regular Thursday) Hard to hear what the staff is asking because of the noise levels  Like someone mentioned before: You can try much more different items for the same price at ACYE sushi, but for a trendy place it is good. Worth just trying out for once and decent enough to come back (recommend take out due to crowding)"}
{"text":"Came by here because I was in the area and had been meaning to try this place. The girl working here was SO nice, and she gave me a run-down of the whole menu and as she made the burrito she made sure everything was to my liking. Such great service is so rare, so that was a nice surprise!   The burrito itself was pretty decent. I can't say that it was stellar, but some places do sushi burritos SO wrong, and overall this was okay and most importantly, fresh. All-in-all, I don't think I would come back here. Mi'hito remains my favourite place for sushi burritos in Toronto."}
{"text":"I ordered classic salmon burrito, and asked to replace red onion with red pepper. But when I took back to office, and found that there was no change at all. Although it is a little bit pricy, it takes so good, will try other flavor next time."}
{"text":"The food is a little expensive, but it's still pretty good.   There's like 3 bar stools so this is definitely more of a takeout place. No hanging out with your friends here.   My favourite thing is that they have fried lotus root, like where else would you ever get that. Their sushi burrito process is pretty cool. If you build your own you pick salty ingredient, a spicy ingredient, a protein (optional) , something sweet and crunch. So you end up with something from a spectrum of flavours. I'm not sure if it will always yield something tasty but it's a nice concept."}
{"text":"Great location, friendly staffs, fresh, tasty and healthy food. I love the rice burger and sushi wrap."}
{"text":"Food is really good and fresh.  Great location, cheap parking in the area and right by the subway.  Order is processed & made in a very fast and organized manner.  Only knock is the lack of dine in space.  Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Had a good trial of sushi burrito in this new place. My order was its signature Kimchi Beef Burrito, the combinations was so good and foods are all fresh.  The service was excellent which impressed me although it is just a fast food place. It is a worth place to come again."}
{"text":"I love this concept of sushi fusion. I customize my sushi burrito with salmon and shrimp tempura along with kale, jicama, seaweed salad and avocado. Extremely delish and refreshing! The only thing I would ask rolltation staff to clarify is on their website, under menu, under toppings, instead of writing max 3, write a disclaimer that it's an extra charge for each topping. Other than that, sashimi is fresh, service is quick and efficient and I'll be sure to try the poke bowls next time!"}
{"text":"I am HOOKED on the poke bowls here. I have never tried any before and in my book it is way more fun, and delight, than what I expected (which is more of a chirashi bowl I suppose).  The assortiment and freshness of ingredients is fantastic. The staff is helpful with making choices of what to mix and match. I've tried the salmon custom, salmon classic, and a few variations on tuna/salmon mixes. All of them were a delight.  If you are looking for a filling but yet light, delicious, spin on sushi type meal this is a perfect place for it. I would intend on taking out as eating in seems a bit cramped."}
{"text":"Certainly more important to like sushi than burritos when dining from this fusion restaurant. I'd say it's more of a gimmick than anything, but really they're not much different than a regular sushi handroll, they're just bigger and more stuffed. Honestly I think actual sushi is easier to eat, but I can see how people would like the convenience and speed of eating these big rolls over standard bite-size sushi. The restaurant is brand new, fresh and clean. The people are friendly and helpful. And at the end of the day, it's good food worth trying!"}
{"text":"I had been excited to try a sushi burrito, what with all the social media posts and hype around it. I came with my friend around 7 for dinner and it was fairly busy. There are only 4 seats at the bar so don't expect to get to sit for your meal. The poor guy behind us had to eat while standing!  My friend and I both got the classic salmon burrito. They were pretty big so if you don't eat much, half would probably fill you up. The ingredients were fresh and tasty.  The burrito tasted like what one would expect a sushi burrito would taste like: a monster sized sushi roll. However, what I didn't like was how because it was so big, each ingredient had to be tasted separately because the whole thing wouldn't fit in my mouth. The pre-set mix of ingredients was also interesting; there was kale, sweet corn and tangerine (!) in the classic salmon. It wasn't bad,  just odd, but you can also customize your own burrito ingredients to suit your taste.  Overall, 3/5. I would come back if I was passing by, but definitely wouldn't go out of my way for a burrito."}
{"text":"Upon entering the store, the staff give you a warm welcome, and almost instantly someone asks if it's your first time and hands you a smaller menu. The menu is straight forward and simple, really easy to use. The staff are very patient with me as it was my first time trying and I was very curious, answering all of my questions!   They offer 6 preset signatures with various proteins (salmon, tuna, chicken, beef, even a veggie option!) with different veggie combinations and sauces. If you don't like any of their presets, they have an option to roll your own burrito! But I strongly suggest trying one of their signatures first, just to get a feel of their awesome food. You can also adjust your sauce level and add as many sauces as you'd like to your burrito or Poké bowl.  The atmosphere is very inviting and pleasing, the decor is rustic, yet modern. They have several tables and seats. Everything is kept very clean as any restaurant should be, especially when you can see the food being made in front of you.   The burrito I got was the regular wasabi tuna burrito, which was suggested by one of the staff due to its popularity. Looking at the ingredients I would have never thought of it working, but everything ties so well together. You have a little bit of sweetness from the tamago(sweet omelette) and the red peppers, with a little kick of wasabi from the wasabi mayo and a nice crunch from the lotus chips. The tuna and avocado was very fresh, very enjoyable.   Overall my experience was very pleasant, as my interaction with the staff was awesome, the food was even better, awesome vibe from the restaurant and I left happy and full!"}
{"text":"LOVEEEEEE!!! My new go to place for poke bowls! Their portions are generous and the flavours are great! And their servers are super friendly (-: been here over 6 times now! They have a stamp card as well so if you're a frequent poke bowl eater, you can get discounts and freebies ~"}
{"text":"Great for healthy, affordable, delicious quick meal:)  It was my first time to visit here. I ordered classic salmon burrito.  Small spot but great atmosphere and I saw they put pretty big amount of salmon in it!  Taste very good but next time if I have a change to have burrito again, I will ask not to put kale in it.   I am gonna try poke next time!!"}
{"text":"Had the Classic Salmon Poke Bowl via delivery. A bit expensive, but tasty especially with a sushi craving. Presentation could be a bit better, but not a big deal.  There were small tangerines that didn't really fit with the dish, would advise to exclude it if you decide to try it."}
{"text":"What's with this sushi burrito craze?  I just don't get it.  That being said, the ingredients are fresh, and the lineup piles up and takes maybe 10 minutes to go from queuing at the door to buying/getting out the door.  If you want a sushi burrito, it's available only with white rice - I guess because the brown rice wouldn't stick together?  Otherwise, you can opt to have your fillings atop a bowl of poke or salad.  Had the Wasabi Tuna Burrito, which is mostly vegetables.  Kinda pricey for $15, considering it's basically a big ol' roll of vegetables and rice.  It basically just tasted like vegetables, imho.  There's a small window bench area for seating, housing only 5 spots so be prepared to either take out or stand & eat. Grab some soy sauce and wasabi next to the chopstick station, but be aware that the wasabi packs a major punch (more than your average wasabi)!"}
{"text":"Such a great sushi burrito. I have been a regular customer for a while and have always been very satisfied with their food. The ingredients taste very fresh and good quality. I suggest doing a custom sushi burrito based on the classic salmon but instead with cucumbers and tuna instead of salmon and onions. Leave the rest the same. It's addictive and Rolltation has a great loyalty card program."}
{"text":"Came in the other day, don't remember which day it was but the burrito was a complete let down. It was really busy so I figured me and a friend would grab and go and chill at EC.   The fish smelled weird as I ate it and it ended up making me throw up later on. I really didn't like how the seaweed was also raunchy like it was also fishy. This time I got the Wasabi Tuna. the seaweed salad also got stuck to my teeth sooo dont expect nice smiles after eating this. The wasabi sauce was so overpowering like the \"normal\" amount or whatever the girl recommended was just TOO MUCH.   Why don't they have a visual guide of the sauce or like some sort of visual at all??? The spicy mayo is fine cause its nice but wasabi mayo??? I really hate how they don't double check when they make your burrito, it seriously does not kill anyone to take an extra 10 seconds to ask bout the sauce otherwise you get gross combinations like the Wasabi Tuna.  The sad part about this is that the Wasabi Tuna is the \"#2\" on the signatures when its this bad and this gross lol"}
{"text":"It's good but i'm not amazed. Still worth trying, and I would definitely come back to try one of the bowls.   I got the classic salmon burrito, and it was $13.99. Quite pricey, but the burrito is huuuge! So huge that I didn't even know how I should eat it! Each bite I took, the other fillings would gush out.. grab a fork incase.   Overall, definitely worth trying & I would come back"}
{"text":"Salmon sushi burrito. Soooo good!! Love that they don't skimp out on the fillings! I came here around 9:15pm on Dec 13th and was quite hungry. Didn't think I was craving this dish until I started eating it and was done less than 10 mins later. Very happy the place was empty when I came."}
{"text":"This is a tiny place for sushi burritos and poke bowls with very few window seats. Most people come here for take out. I came here during a lull so I got a seat after ordering and chatting with the workers. They're very friendly and quite funny. They made me feel welcome.   I got the shrimp tempura sushi burrito with teriyaki sauce. It was quite good and now I know I should order extra sauce next time, as you can tell them how much to put in. The burrito could've been rolled more tightly since it started falling apart mid burrito, but that didn't bother me too much. A sushi burrito with a can of pop was just under $16. Not bad for a quick dinner downtown.   I'll be back! I got my stamp card started, after all."}
{"text":"For anyone who doesn't like spicy food or you should tell them to go light on the spicy mayo or the wasabi mayo. The first time I forgot and it felt like I was eating a mouth full of spice."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious poké bowls! I was pleasantly surprised by the number of toppings they have and the friendly service. For my first visit, the staff on shift explained toppings which I was unsure of and what recommendations she had.   The portions were on the lighter side and would definitely be a good light, healthy lunch. It is also definitely a bit pricy for the portions. However, the proportion of toppings to rice was perfect - not too much rice, and just enough toppings!  In my poké bowl: brown rice (base), salmon (protein), cucumber + carrot + red radish + edamame (3 veggies - they accidentally gave me an extra), spicy sesame (sauce), avocado + tobiko + green onion (3 toppings), tempura bits + sesame seeds (crunch)  What I definitely recommend: brown rice (healthier and feels less heavy to eat), salmon, carrots, cucumbers, edamame, spicy sesame sauce (for a kick!), avocado, tempura bits, and sesame seeds"}
{"text":"Did takeout for a quick work lunch. Ordered the kimchi beef to give sushi burrito a try. There`s lots of ingredients available to put in, and everything taste flavourful. Be mindful how much you put in as it falls apart easily. Messy meal on the run"}
{"text":"this is a nice surprise, tried for the 1st time today, got a huge rice bowl with salmon and tuna and lots of veggies and toppings . everything was super fresh, loved it"}
{"text":"Don't let the size fool you. Half a burrito is actually incredibly filling! I split the tuna wasabi burrito with my friend and I was so uncomfortably full afterwards.  It's actually quite delicious but can get messy if it's too saucy and if you don't eat it quickly, things can get soggy really quick. The tuna wasabi was great aside from the red pepper - the taste didn't mesh well. Also, a little too expensive for one (~$16 with tax).  The store has a few seats, bright inside and clean. Staff is very friendly and helpful (offered box, tissues and sauce).  Would definitely return and recommend!"}
{"text":"Do i think this place is overhyped and overpriced? Yes. Do i keep coming back here every time I'm in town? Yup.  I guess i just really like having all my favourite sushi ingredients together and it sometimes comes out tasting weird but i like it. I always crave it when I come to downtown. I usually roll my own cause i dont eat seafood.  I would recommend you try it once just to have a sushi burrito experience but dont make it a regular meal."}
{"text":"Yay! A Poke bowl place near my work at bloor/yonge! When I want to venture outside and treat myself, this is a great option. Portions are filling enough for me, however I wish there was slightly more protein. I love the texture of the brown rice in Poke bowls (and I usually prefer white rice).  It's a little too pricy for me to have on a regular basis though. Especially since there are a lot of other cheap lunch options in the area."}
{"text":"Got the tuna poke bowl here and really enjoyed it! Definitely going to come back and try the salmon one next time. They give a good portion of fish and do not skimp! I actually had a poke bowl earlier in the summer when I went to LA became it became a craze here in Toronto, and this place is better!"}
{"text":"Ordered my food online. Very easy to pick up. Very expensive for what you are getting. I would not visit again. On the other hand, my friend really liked it. She said she would visit again."}
{"text":"Am I the only one who thinks there is just 1 ingredient in the roll/poke that doesn't quite fit?  I was not a fan of the kidney beans in the kimchi beef burrito; I didn't like the tangerines with the salmon poke; I didn't think the red pepper complimented the tuna poke.  With my order, the portion of fish to topping/rice was weak for the poke bowls.  Not sure if this was an off day as I've seen very positive reviews for this place but I would prefer pokes from other places.  The kimchi burrito was my favourite.  Think of this spot as more of a take-out joint so be prepared to look for a somewhere else to eat your food since there are only 4 seats available.  Perk: you can order online for pickup or delivery."}
{"text":"Update: I usually ask for one less topping so I ask for extra lotus root and didn't get that today. And all the lotus root in my roll were stale!!! I had to spit them all out because they were so soggy and hard to chew.   It was packed tonight and there was only one person in charge of creating all the rolls/bowls, which didn't seem very efficient to me.   Debating whether or not I will come back here."}
{"text":"Location/Service It is right on the intersection between Yonge and Eglinton, very convenient if you're out from the subway or working nearby. Parking can be a little difficult since it's a busy area.   Inside is very modern with small seating available. This place is more of a buy-and-go kind of style. That being said, ordering process is pretty clear and they have a cool assembly line that you can watch your order being made.   Staff were friendly and makes sure you ordered what you wanted, along with various options to choose from.   Food Ordered the sushi burrito wasabi tuna, at normal spice level. Essentially this is a giant sushi hand roll, but it's jammed packed with ingredients. I liked how the tuna was fresh and a good amount of it and it blends well with the seaweed salad, peppers, avacado and wasabi mayo. It wasn't actually spicy at all, so I can definitely take it up a notch next time.  Some say the portion was huge, I found it okay (probably I was super hungry). You can dine in or take out, so it's perfect for busy lifestyle people.   Overall, I find it an interesting experience. My burrito does cost about $15, but it is justifiable with the size and portion of ingredients. I like how they have fixed menu items and a \"build your own\" to choose from, brings a little bit of variety and personalization. Also, you can choose either a burrito or poke bowl!"}
{"text":"If you are craving some sushi but just want it simple and in a burrito form, Rolltation is where you gotta go! Been wanting to try this place in forever since I heard about their opening and since I tried Poké Guys!   Ahhhhh nothing beats the taste of sushi-related condiments in a burrito form! They didn't stuff it with too much rice either so that was a relief! You can also order beef, chicken or shrimp options but I had to stick with the classic...salmon! Yum! They offer 3 different ways to make your food: 1. Burrito (of course!) 2. Poké bowl and 3. Salad and their order options are preset but you can also make your own order or modify their existing options by replacing/adding toppings!  The place is of decent size so it can definitely fit groups of 4-6. They have a big center oval table too. Service was good but probably because I came during a quiet time. Guess that's just my luck when I want to try new things :P kidding! In any case, they were nice, welcoming and patient as I decided my order.  I definitely want to come back and try their Kimchi Beef since I was debating between that and the Classic Salmon (which I ended up having). Maybe you should try it too!"}
{"text":"I was away this summer and when I came back, there were sushi burrito and poke shops EVERYWHERE. Sushi burritos were always an interesting concept to me, because they seem just like uncut sushi rolls eaten with hands. So I had to try it for myself.   Constant line-ups during lunch at Rolltation. They are always busy so I appreciate how fresh their fish and toppings are. They also use a measuring cup for the fish and they are quite generous (it looks like 1/2 cup at least). I go with the Classic Salmon Burrito, which is not cheap at $13.99, but it's very filling, and stuffed with ingredients. Perhaps too much kale for my liking, but they have corn, carrot for an extra crunch, crispy bits, wasabi tobiko, etc. They have all their ingredients out and you can add additional toppings which is awesome. You can also modify the amount of sauce because the end of the burrito is quite messy. Then finally it is rolled and ready to eat! If you are a Japanese food critic, this may not be for you because the sushi rice is pressed onto the seaweed by a machine and there is very little rice just lining all the other ingredients.   If your first experience was their Thanksgiving giveaway, just know that they were like a factory churning out burritos that day so the rolls could not be modified (usually they ask you for additional options like at Subway) and the rolling wasn't as meticulous as usual. However this business is great because they are willing to reach out to everyone in Toronto and they are doing a lot of promos (e.g. review on Facebook and get free takoyaki).   There is a laidback, happy vibe in the store and all the staff are friendly! Minimal seating. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Fresh and healthy!! Tried the classic salmon burrito love it so much, delicious and full of fresh vegetables. They provided very good customer service, the staffs are very friendly and polite. Definitely will go back and try more of their items!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! The food was fresh and delicious so I will definitely go back, but it was extremely expensive (40$ for 2 people to get 2 bowls and 2 cans of nestea) and our poke bowls weren't portioned as well as the other poke places in Toronto (they were mostly rice and the rice was white as they had sold out of brown).  It's absolutely worth a try, but get there early as there are only 5 chairs and there isn't really anywhere to sit and hang outside."}
{"text":"My first time here. Very delicious! Definitely better than the sushitto (sp?) truck. Still quite pricey, but worth it once in a while. I got the classic salmon burrito, can't go wrong. The mandarin and corn were strange additions flavour wise, but still pretty good. The salmon was good, not sinewy. The avocado and spicy mayo were creamy. And the kale and tempura bits added the perfect amount of crunch. I would go again!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon. A small line but not too busy. I got the kimchi beef burrito ($12.99). I enjoyed it, and agree with other reviewers in that the ingredients were fresh, but service was slow, staff not friendly and the price is a bit high for what it is. If it was a sit down restaurant and if service was better the price would be a bit more justifiable, but this is just a grab and go place. I would revisit to try the salmon roll but it definitely isn't my \"go to\" place. Worth a try though!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is all about.  There was barely any fish and it was ridiculously sauced up.  I couldn't eat it because it was just mayo on mayo and on a lot of rice.  The dish it itself had too many conflicting ingredients that didn't mesh well.  I bought their set wasabi tuna bowl which came out to be $16.95 after tax. Restaurant pricing for subpar quality fast food.  Hugely dissapointed."}
{"text":"Service was good the food was fresh but made into a sushi burrito, it was pretty unappetizing. You can't eat it on the go."}
{"text":"Oh My God!! This place is an imitation of Pokeworks in New york. Everything is copied from pokeworks except the taste. Even the design of take out menu was exactly same.  I bought Kimchi beef poke and salmon burrito. Beef was too tough to chew. Rasberry bbq sauce was not a good combination with kimchi. Have some creativity in business, decoration and menu."}
{"text":"Stopped by here because was craving a poke bowl so I got the classic salmon poke bowl it was really good but one thing I would take out is the tangerine out it didn't mix well with all the other ingredients  but nonetheless the food was delicious and everything was fresh which is a plus   Will definitely come back to try out their sushi burger"}
{"text":"Rolltation is a great place for a grab n' go sushi burrito. Had the wasabi tuna roll which was absolutely delicious--the wasabi mayo sauce matched the rest of the fixings extremely well, and the tuna fish was satisfyingly meaty and tasted really fresh. The salmon roll was quite good as well, though the mandarin oranges they add in are a bit off-putting. I'd say the tuna burrito combination was more well put together.  If only this place wasn't so small! The space is really tight, so during lunch/dinner hours this place is packed. There are few seats so be prepared to just grab n' go. Service is surprisingly still relatively fast though, and they make the rolls in front of you so you can tell when yours is coming up. As well, don't be turned off by the slightly pricier menu--for $14 you get a massive burrito that fills anyone up easily.  Plus they gave out a free takoyaki coupon for filling out a survey--bonus!"}
{"text":"They are one of the only options in Toronto that offer Poke as of right now, so it is a bit hard to compare them to competition but overall this place is the equivalent of a good/average sushi bar."}
{"text":"Really really unique and exciting way of eating sushi. I knew I wanted to try it when I saw a pic of a sushi burrito on Instagram. We went in last night and I ordered the skinny sumo burrito. The staff were really nice and friendly and greeted us as soon as we went in. You can choose to get it in a bowl but I wanted the burrito experience. They made our order right in front of us and made it very fast I was honestly impressed by the amount of things they could fit in there.   The burrito itself was ok. The sumo burrito comes with seaweed salad which to me tasted really bad (not my cup of tea), so I had to pick it out of the burrito as I couldn't stand the taste of it and the burrito ended up falling apart lol. Honestly this was my fault but the seaweed salad left a really bad taste in my mouth so next time I'm going to build my own burrito :) can't wait to go back (and update my review)"}
{"text":"(3.5*)  TL;DR Look for Frank hes got you covered on burrito insurance for the first 10 minutes; after that it's a blood bath with the sauce. The extremely generous amount of Fish is definately fresh (at least when I come lol) which explains the high price.  Let's split this Downtown Toronto Fusion Sensation into two categories since it's a quick hand-friendly grab and go.  SERVICE 5/5*  Most employees are very welcoming and friendly, easily approachable and knowledgable. I commend their hardwork to creating a very homey atmosphere.  If you see Frank especially, you're in for a treat because his smiles and love is dedicated to tightly tucking your fillings away into that crispy sheet of seaweed. He's my utmost favourite person to come to when I need a burrito to be rolled up and taken away on my journeys to a mundane work life. He never fails to provide a secure wrap and my fillings have NEVER ONCE FALLEN OUT like most reviews claim.  That's called dedication right there.  FOOD 3/5*   Unfortunately, the food IN MY OPINION was overhyped. You get the fresh generous fish 100% sure which is also probably why the prices are so goddamn high, but what accompanied the delicacy was what got me jumping out of the fishermans boat.   Out of the 3 slices of avocado, 2 were hard and bitter. The tempura bits were beautiful eye candy yes, but they were drenched in oil to the point that because I left my other half of the burrito sitting for too long (10 minutes - okay listen IM A SLOW EATER FORGIVE ME(?)), the oil had soaked through the wax paper and onto my hand. Eventually the sauce became too watery to the point where the bottom of the wrap had a hole. THEN i was struggling to stay clean.  Tips:  Eat this fast because it's has ingrediants at its prime, it'll spoil easily; aesthetically and internally.  Avoid the tempura bits if you're not into grease or carbs.  Avoid avocados for conflicting mushy and crunchy (?) textures (inconsistent ripeness)  Avoid seaweed salad for getting it stuck in between your teeth.  Avoid tangerines, tomatoes, and tuna (or anything that has a lot of liquid in the container) because the water content will rip your burrito wrap a new one.  Also petition to make Brown Rice Burritos a thing!"}
{"text":"We are definitely late in joining the sushi burrito and poke bowl craze and for our first experience, we decided to go with Rolltation based on the positive reviews. It did not disappoint.   My husband built his own Teri Shrimp sushi burrito while I opted to build my own tofu poke bowl (only because of some dietary restrictions at the moment). Each and every ingredient was extremely fresh and they were fairly generous with the portions. There were probably over 20 different toppings and around 8 to 10 different sauces. You have the option to get light, regular or extra sauce.  We both opted for the unagi/eel sauce, and the regular amount was just right, although I may consider requesting for sauce on the side next time. Given how packed the bowl was, it wasn't easy mixing in the sauce evenly. They charged an extra dollar for some toppings, such as kani salad (i.e. imitation crab with mayo) and avocado, but it was well worth it. The burrito did disintegrate as some of the other reviewers mentioned after a bite or two, but with so many ingredients wrapped in the burrito, it's probably unavoidable.   Overall, we really enjoyed the food, although I do wish they had the option to add seaweed / nori strips as a topping for the poke bowls. I think it would have really elevated the dish. Another reason why I didn't give full stars is because I felt really thirsty after the meal and had to drink a lot of water. This is something hard to avoid especially since unagi sauce is mostly made up of soya sauce, which contains MSG. Regardless, these things would not prevent us from going back!"}
{"text":"I've only been to one other poke bowl restaurant before and it was such a pleasant experience, I was excited to try out another one. Similar to most sushi burrito and bowl places, this place has fresh items and are indeed quite filling!  However, I really enjoy the selection of different proteins including shrimp tempura, chicken and beef! I ordered the teriyaki shrimp and it was absolutely delicious. Quite a few hearty portions of shrimp, packed with kani salad, cabbage, cucumbers, carrots, edamame, corn and purple tempura bits. I'd recommend grabbing a packet of soya sauce and if you can get the wasabi mayo on the side, that'll add a punch of flavour."}
{"text":"Went for my friend and I's first time about a week ago and we both very much enjoyed it! It was our first time having sushi burritos and this will be hard to beat! I got the teri-shrimp burrito and absolutely loved it! The price is a little higher than expected, as the burrito does include raw fish, so just beware.   My friend and I both enjoyed our burritos and we will definitely be returning in the near future!"}
{"text":"Although others claim to be, I've tried them all and this is the best sushi burrito in town. The crappy place on John south of Richmond is not in the same category at all. This place is fast extremely clean, amazing generous portions of fish, and :-) friendly staff. 100% worth every penny... And it's not that many pennies!!!"}
{"text":"First take on a sushi burrito and I was pleasantly surprised.. the portion is generous and the ingredients were super fresh! Much recommended and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Newish sushi burrito place close by. At least this is a permanent structure and I'm not always chasing down sushiburrito food trucks. I really like this place because you can customize your sushi burrito or poke bowl!  They do offer a few standard \"classic\" ones, salmon, tuna, kimchi beef? But I definitely need to customize. Some places put real weird stuff in their burritos, like cream cheese? What real sushi lover puts cream cheese in their sushi, seriously.   I opted for the poke bowl with rice, you can also get it without rice and more veggies like a poke salad. I thought I would try brown rice as a \"healthier\" option. I chose salmon as my protein cause I just love salmon. Cucumber and lettuce for the veggies. Wasabi mayo cause the other places I went to didn't offer this. For the toppings a lot of the goooooood stuff are additional cost... boo... Like avocado $1, kani salad $1, seaweed salad $1, meat floss $0.5 and wasabi tobiko $0.5. I definitely wanted avocado and seaweed salad, so yums. And tobiko as well. I regretted not putting in mango cause that would be real tasty too. I added the tempura bits but they were pink and small and wasn't as tasty as I thought. Next time I will opt for something else. The brown rice was the healthier choice but it did compromise the taste a bit. It was rough!!  There was a bit of a wait around lunch time, the line was out the door for sure, but it wasn't too bad. The place is pretty small, just an area in front of the bar for you to line up and then there are four seats by the window. I was a bit disappointed that there weren't real seating here, that would have been nice. The portion was quite big, I can actually split into two meals. Service was really good. I will definitely be back for more customization."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Once a couple months ago, and once today.   When I came here a couple months ago, the place was pretty much dead. I think I came at a weird hour or something but nonetheless, I ended up ordering a salmon sushi burrito. I'm not gonna lie, it was pretty good. The salmon was fresh, it was flavourful, and they definitely did not skimp out on any toppings. Even though it was kind of pricey.. I thought it was justified because the burrito itself was MASSIVE. Also, the service was good (the people behind the counter were super friendly).   Fast-forward to today...... I came in around lunch time and it was pretty busy. I ordered the same thing (salmon sushi burrito) and had a much different experience than before. I don't know if it was because they were busy so they rushed my order, but as soon as I unwrapped my burrito, it basically exploded everywhere and started falling apart. Once I managed to KIND OF put it back together, I took a bite. To be honest, it wasn't as good as the first time. It pretty much lacked flavour.. and I ended up just eating the rest with a fork because it was impossible to hold together.   Overall, I think there's better sushi burrito places out there for a similar price. Maybe next time i'll try the bowls."}
{"text":"Ordered the classic salmon poke bowl with brown rice. The fish was fresh and as other reviewers mentioned, the tempura bits are a nice addition. Portion was plentiful. Great spot to pick up lunch if you work in the area. Can order online, then grab and go! Perfect for the busy worker bees."}
{"text":"I was thrilled upon first biting into a sushi burrito. I got one of those perfect bites that beautifully balance all the ingredients and delight the taste buddies. Having tried most of the burritos I'd say the Teri shrimp (tempura) is my favorite, followed by the salmon. There are probably 10-15 different things that go into each burrito, it's pretty big. It's also so much healthier than much quick fare as there are plenty of veggies in the finished roll. It seems expensive at first but it's worth it as it's quite filling. For around 15 dollars you can get a burrito and a drink. I sometimes eat only half and finish it an hour or two later (but it's better to eat all at once if you got tempura).  The restaurant is quite attractive and clean, and the staff were friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend trying a sushi burrito if you haven't yet had the pleasure."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi burrito and pokè bowls iv ever had the environment is so alive and modern it's very enjoyable,   The location is very small making the place rather crowded and it was quite a wait to get in to the restaurant to get the burrito but when you do arrive it's worth the wait, the people making my burrito were so nice and generous with the portions it's Awesome I was wondering the whole time how they were gonna roll this massive heap together,  The food was fresh and so we're all the ingredients if you go I suggest you do build your own and not one of their select options as it's more satisfying to build your own creation  Regarding price it was quite expensive I paid about $19 but that was for a double portion of salmon (extra $2) and I also got avacado on top (extra $1) but regardless of the price it was MASSIVE like I couldn't finish it. I do suggest it for anyone who's interested in trying a sushi burrito!!"}
{"text":"It is Real  great food and extremely decelious. I always go there for my lunch. My kids love it. I go everyday"}
{"text":"Ordered classic salmon burrito. I am allergic to carrots so they allowed me to substitute with cucumbers (no hassle) -Everything tasted very fresh and crunchy...At first I thought the tangerines would be weird but surprisingly they mesh really well together! I will be returning to try their other flavours.   The staff were great and quick with my order (I ordered on Ritual)."}
{"text":"YUM! I got the Classic Salmon Burrito and it was awesome! Try to go at non-peak times as that line gets buuuusy! My only recommendation to the owners would be to eventually offer a slightly smaller size for cheaper - it's awesome that Rolltation doesn't skimp on the good stuff but I wasn't able to finish mine and it isn't quite big enough to split between two people. Tasty, relatively \"fast\" so hitting the healthy-portion quota would have gotten 5 stars from me :)"}
{"text":"For the past 2 weeks I have been going back for at least 5 times, I really enjoy this place and recommended to all my friends, I felt the roll is very good value consider when I had that food truck thing, it was $20 something and it is pre-rolled One burrito is $12.99 plus tax if you want more seaweed or avocado it is $1 extra.   Just saw a person said one burrito here is the same amount of food you get from \"2x 3$ maki\" LMAO  why you always lying always lying hmmmygwad stop f**king lying  You can always not liking something, but for God sake show some respect to those people who is working hard and trying to do better. And I have seen the passion in the rolltation staff.   I understand there were some mistakes over the past few days, but nobody is perfect, and I'm sure all the food joints would never try to give their customers bad experience intentionally, otherwise what's the point of being in this industry.   For those people who are way too salty about this place, eat more wasabi and let's see how you complain about it is not sweet."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had picked up a bowl for me, and when I opened my bag to check out the dish, I was SPEECHLESS. The bowl is half empty - it literally looked like someone ate from it. It doesn't look appetizing at all, nor does it look as how the bowl is advertised. Very disappointed... Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Checked out this new spot near st. Patrick's station and it was packed. Service was quick and they were welcoming. Food was really good and they had lots of veggie options to choose from. I'll come back here for sure!!   Taste: 5/5 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 3.5/5  Price: 5/5 Portion: 5/5  Taste: made my own salmon and tuna burrito....mmmmmm...I'm still dreaming about it. The salmon and tuna were super fresh and they put in lots of it! Added in sweet corn, tomago, cucumbers, tangerines and edamame. I had the wasabi mayo and advocado! So gooooooood. So delicious!! I also poured a little bit of soya sauce on it! Love my soya sauce with sushi rice in seaweed. We also ordered takoyai and soft shell crab. Tokoyaki was deep fried and delicious and we could have done without the soft shell crab.   Service: upon entry we were greeted with warm welcomes! The line is long here but it moves quick and they are sure efficient! They made our burritos super fast. The fried food took a bit more time.  Atmosphere: you can't miss the glowing rolltation sign here and the matching outfits. The place is a bit small and there's no seating area otherwise would have given this a 5.   Price: $14 a burrito which is about the same as market price.   Portion: my burrito was so big I actually only ate half for lunch and saved the other half for the next day. Great value!"}
{"text":"Tasty sushi burritos! I've had the salmon burrito (pictured) and poke bowl...both great. You can also customize your level of sauce. A great healthier option for an on-the-go meal."}
{"text":"First time getting the much talked about sushi burrito!  The salmon one was the one I got it's the classic one. I loved it! It was filling refreshing and not heavy! It felt like a very healthy alternative. They also have other choices like tuna and kimchi beef! The salmon burrito one I got had tangerines in it too making it taste sweet and tangy but with a kick of sourness. I absolutely loved it and recommend anyone to try this !"}
{"text":"I really liked this place and there were so many reasons not to. I created my own burrito. It was amazing. They could streamline the custom orders a bit better by just having an ingredient list and pencil. The place is TINY. There are only 4 spots to sit. Giant line. BUT, I enjoyed every second of my delicious burrito. I had tuna and put all this random stuff on it. There was a lot of tuna on it. Everything was fresh. The brutal line that moved quickly. I'm happy my fellow Yelp! friend Susan F. suggested it. I will definitely come back at some point. OH, but the burrito is obviously messy AF. So don't go here on a first date. And the cost is up there. If you're looking for a cheap sush sesh, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I got the kimchi and beef bowl which contained lettuce, onion, carrot, kimchi(!!!), kidney bean, avocado, and asparagus on brown rice. They used spicy sesame sauce and I was happy that the sauce (unlike most poke places) didn't mask the taste of the other ingredients. The beef was still warm and I think they prepared it the same way as bugolgi because it was sweet tasting and delicious. Service was solid too, you order at the end of the store and you pay after they finish preparing it. Clean and spacious tables and space. Would totally return and visit their other locations!"}
{"text":"After reading all these positive review about this place, I decided to give it a try.  Result: disapponited.  I agreed with some yelpers commented about their \"not so good service\", which I found the same. They never double check the order before hand it over to the customers and they messed up my order. For example white rice poke became brown rice.   I got one tuna sushi burrito and one salmon poke. Nothing special or stand out compared to other similar places. The fish isnt fresh at all. Seaweed salad and avocardo costs a dollar extra each, on top of the burrito price. LoL. I am fine to pay more since i could choose my own topping and sauce but I will expect better and fresher food quality.  I also found this place used a machine to put the rice on the seaweed before they put toppings and sauce on. I dont really like they way they do it becuase i think good sushi is made by human hand not machine. But i learn from this visit that you do not need to have any skills to make sushi. I dont think i will come back again."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place!!! I've been eyeing this joint since it opened. I was finally in the area and had MR drive around the block so I could buy takeout. (Not really convenient location if driving since there's really no place to stop your car).  Personally, I'm not a big fan of burritos, but merge it with sushi stuffing- well, then that's a whole different story!!! (But then again, put salmon sashimi, spicy mayo and tobiko together and I'll love anything it goes with).  I choose to \"build my own burrito\", opting out of anything that tasted sweet as my palate is geared towards the salty side.  During my visit on a Sunday it wasn't too busy.  It took probably 6 mins from the time walked in till when I walked out.   As many other Yelpers have mentioned, the price range is approximately  $12-$15 per burrito/poke bowl. Not cheap, but really satisfying."}
{"text":"Seeing so many poke places pop up because of the poke trend, I was initially pretty skeptical walking in. However, Rolltation is a place that actually deserves the hype. I had the wasabi tuna bowl (Disclaimer: I got it for free during a promotion they had) and it was absolutely delicious. I was pleasantly surprised after having mediocre poke and sushi burritos for an entire summer in New York because Rolltation doesn't skimp on portions (you won't find three or four tiny pieces of fish here) or quality of fish. The sauce and mix-ins are balanced perfectly, and I'm definitely coming back to try the other combinations."}
{"text":"This is a late review as I tried Rolltation in the summertime and haven't gotten around to reviewing the place, but I do quite like Rolltation for their portion sizes and toppings. The way they arrange their poke bowls is very visually appealing (colorful and neat). However, the fish is not marinaded (which is good for some, but for me I'm a saucy gal- I like fish that has flavour) and so I found that to be slightly disappointing as the sauce that goes as a topping is just that - a topping but the flavour is not in every bite. It was also a bit expensive for the one size, near $15 including tax which I found a bit expensive for my student budget (there are other poke places that sell for the same portion but is less expensive). However, they do occasionally do a 10% discount with student ID which I do think is good for students. Service is always fast, although friendliness depends on the staff at work (hit or miss). Would recommend."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the fresh ingredients at Rolltation. I've tried the classic salmon burrito, tuna bowl and also a DIY bowl.   This place is tiny with only a few seats available making it more of a takeout joint. All rolls and bowls have great flavours with fresh ingredients. I prefer the sushi burrito over the bowls as the nori melds the flavour together very well. I would only get the burrito if I was going to eat it right away so the nori doesn't get soggy.  One thing I would have to nitpick about is in the wasabi tuna combo. It has red peppers which I was not a fan of the flavour combination.  If you are a picky eater you can DIY your own. The DIY option can end up to be pricier than it is already if you decide to pick premium toppings.   Overall this is a good place to try the sushi burritos in Toronto. Service was quite efficient and portion wise it will fill you up."}
{"text":"I've finally tried the sushi burrito and I love it. Their selection is very wide and the staff is very nice. Love the food."}
{"text":"I tried my first sushi burrito here.  It was decent and it was a novel experience, but I would not say it was as mouth-watering as others describe it to me.  The portion size was great, but I found that because it was slightly larger than the burritos at other establishments, I had some difficulty keeping all the filling between the seaweed near the bottom.  This could just be my inexperience with handling sushi burritos, mind you.  I had the salmon sushi burrito and it was ok. It tasted like an average salmon avocado maki roll from a decent Japanese restaurant.  The ingredients were fresh, but I would not say they \"wowed\" me.  There is a high diversity of ingredients that make up the filling, but for me, I found that it had too much going on compared to the fillings at Mi'hito.  Given the location of Rolltation's branches, I would still highly recommend people to give these burritos a go if they are curious about this new fad!"}
{"text":"Walked past this place and had to try it! The sushi burrito did not disappoint. I got the shrimp tempura one and it was just the right amount of sauce! Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp tempura with spicy mayo and it was amazing. Pricey but huge portions. Worth sharing if you are going for a snack. Lots of topings as well."}
{"text":"I've ordered the wasabi tuna burritos and the order online is the most efficient way during the weekdays."}
{"text":"A sushi burrito is not cheap. It cost $13.99 ($15.81 after taxes) for the Classic Salmon Sushi Burrito. You could watch the guy behind the counter assemble your sushi burrito and use ingredients that were colourful and looked super fresh.  When eating it, I did like how the ingredients were extremely fresh, the rice was minimal, and the salmon was super fresh! It was good. I found that dripping a few dollops of soy sauce into it helped the flavour too. Also, another thought was that because there were so many fresh and crisp vegetables in it, at one point, it felt like I was eating a salad. Maybe this could be branded as more of a \"sushi and salad in a burrito\" instead."}
{"text":"First off, terrible value for what you get. We got a Poke bowl with salmon and tuna and an extra topping for $18 after tax. It had about the same amount of meat as 2 x $3 maki rolls at most places.   It's saving grace was the flavour which was decently tasty. But once the meat is gone (and it goes quickly), you're left with rice and toppings."}
{"text":"Decided to give Rolltation a try and boy are their sushi burritos huge. I ordered the Classic Salmon burrito through the Ritual app which made it extra convenient in avoiding those long lines during lunch. Almost felt guilty just walking in and out with my food while everyone else lined up for their food lol.   The ingredients were very fresh and all the flavours complemented each other really well. Only downside: too many red onions! I had to pick them all out. The burritos were HUGE. Definitely enough to share between two people or for two meals."}
{"text":"I built my own burrito and it was delicious!   My favourite fillings would be the teri mayo sauce, salmon, tamago (sweet egg), purple potato, and any of the crunchy veggies to round it out. Satisfies the taste buds and the belly, and it makes you feel like you made a healthy choice. ;)   The crew working here is cool, too. I'm looking forward to trying their other proteins!"}
{"text":"Sushi burritos are one of the most genius foods to be invented and Rolltation does them well! The burritos are MASSIVE! My boyfriend and I ordered the classic salmon burrito which was $13.99. Inside is a mix of kale, carrots, sweet corn, tangerine, avocado, tempura bits and salmon with a really fun sriracha mayo sauce. It is literally a party of flavors in your mouth! The ingredients taste so fresh and you get quite a bit of salmon too. After I finished one half of the burrito, I was pretty full, but I couldn't wait to dig into the next half.   The burritos however, were a challenge to eat. I couldn't figure out how to keep everything from spilling out after each bite so I ended up with an extra meal of burrito filling in the takeout container. I also found that they put too many onions and we were left with a strong post-meal onion breath.   Overall, we really enjoyed our meal and Rolltation is definitely the spot to go to for this latest, greatest food trend!"}
{"text":"Yum! It is a little pricy for what it is but I do enjoy the fresh ingredients and yummy roll outcome. Probably not an everyday, or even once a week meal. But definitely a fun meal once in a while :) this location is also much more spacious and comfortable than the Dundas location, and the staff are friendly and not as rushed here."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by the poke bowls at Rolltation. I got the Classic Salmon Poke, which tasted okay but the portion was much smaller than many other poke bowl places downtown. The price was pretty steep as well, considering the size of the portion. I paid around $15 and did not feel that I got my money's worth. The bowl had a lot of rice/salad and not enough toppings.   The service was pretty slow as well. There were 2 people in front of us, but it still took a long time for my friends and I to get our food.   In terms of the restaurant itself, there was a moderate amount of seating and the space was pretty clean.   I expected better, since Rolltation is a well known name in Toronto, but I had a lacklustre experience at this particular location and probably won't be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"I drop by this place every once in a while when I'm in the Eaton Centre/Hospital district area to grab a Sushi Burrito.  I usually get the Classic Salmon Burrito which is loaded with salmon sashimi, kale, avocado, red onion, sweet corn, tangerine, and the kicker ... tempura bits.  The tempura bits add an amazing texture (similar to adding chips to sandwich) while still maintaining a clean and healthy feeling to the burrito overall.  Price comes out to around $12.99 plus tax, which is where the points card comes in handy as you get 10% off every 3 burritos you buy with the 10th one free.  The service was fast and friendly and they give you a neat paper bag (think Banana Republic) to take away with you.  The portion size is reasonably filling and comes in a nice contoured cardboard box, so props for presentation.  Overall, this place is worth checking out every once in a while, but I wouldn't over-do it as I can see myself getting sick of it if I indulged once a week."}
{"text":"i LOVE sushi. Sushi burritos were made for me! ^^ So many fresh ingredients, so many possibilities to \"rolltate\" between! This place is small, but super efficient. Walking in, the space is clean, bright, colourful & welcoming. Nice to see smiling staff :) Their menu isn't all too confusing, perfect for on-the-go. I decided to roll my own first sushi burrito. Exciting stuff. Very generous portions: I was scared they could barely roll mine at the end! They didn't roll it so tight, but that didn't affect my eating experience. What I absolutely LOVED were the tempura bits that they offer, it's purple! They let you add as much 'crunch' as you want, a little bit of ayce treatment there xD so I went a little crazy with the tempura bits and furikake. I got mine to-go and ate at a park with friends. This is a great healthy alternative, filling, and totally satisfying to my tastebuds! For that, I didn't mind the price of $15. They have a loyalty stamp card, which I like; I think this will be my go-to whenever I'm downtown!!"}
{"text":"One of the better sushi burritos I've had. Portions are generous, there's a good ratio of rice to toppings, and the seaweed wrap actually stays in tact! They're a bit on the pricier side; $11.49 for a roll-your-own tuna burrito. They do have a loyalty card and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I felt very overwhelmed by the menu on the wall, and couldn't make up my mind. I would recommend one of the signature items so you don't gotta think too hard. Basically, you could go for the burrito, the poke (white rice), or the salad base. I had the salmon (sashimi) burrito. Added avacado for an extra charge. I liked that they had kimchi as a topping. My burrito cost almost $17 bucks. Dont get me wrong, it was really delicious and filling but a bit too pricey for me. . But heck, an AYCE sushi restaurant is like double that price. I would go back next time I feeling for sushi."}
{"text":"I'm pretty late on the sushi burrito fad but finally got a chance to try it at Rollatation. This location can get quite busy during lunch time and there's not too much seating offered so try to avoid the rush hours. Props to the staff keeping the store very clean.  I ended up trying the Fruity Tofu burrito (one of their signature options). Since I went for a vegetarian option, I didn't get a chance to test out the freshness of their fish. However, if they're at par with the other ingredients used in my burrito, which were very fresh by the way, then I would say that Rolltation has definitely got their freshness game rolling.  **Side note, sushi burritos look clean cut and all, but I had a difficult time trying to salvage my dignity while I worked through this burrito like a savage as it fell apart on me. Grab an extra napkin.**  Since I enjoyed the pairing of flavours from their Signature burritos, I think I would try to build my own burrito the next time I come back."}
{"text":"Food Selection / Portion  Portion size is generous but having large portion for the price to be frank, isn't really worth it except for your waist line.  I'd rather have less for a more affordable price (e.g. less than $10 including tax and no tip bc it's basically a take-out place) and variety options.  The food was fresh but I feel these sushi burritos are just a fad that in a few years, will fade away like all the 168 bubble tea places in Toronto / GTA OR that other sushi restaurants will incorporate these burritos into their menu. It's a messy food trend like the the overpriced food trucks across Toronto - btw, they're not very clean and with those prices, you can eat a decent dine-in meal.   One down-fall was that they do not offer free water.  You'd need to buy a bottled water and judging by the recent media news of Nestle outbidding a town for ownership to the well-water, I'm pretty sure it won't bode well as a consumer having to pay for water in Toronto where we know the tap water is generally safe."}
{"text":"I went in and had a classic salmon burrito and it was amazing, the combination of ingredients like kale and corn added to the flavour. The service was really fast, the only downside is that there are only 5 seats by the window so coming there around lunch, my friend and I had to go eat the burritos elsewhere. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi burrito rolls. One of the latest food trends that emerged out of the Asian American community food scene. They are basically a delivery system for a gigantic amount of fish, veggies and rice. I ordered a Wasabi tuna sushi burrito to go, since I had to grab the bus back to Montreal. It was tasty, very filling and fresh. Best handheld bus food I've had in a very long time. The wasabi sauce was also extremely tasty, while not being overpowering.   Oh, and for the record, they also happen to be massive. Due to the size, you need to take huge bites to have everything incorporated in the flavour, or else you are basically eating individual items."}
{"text":"Classic salmon burrito roll. It was okay. Price point is a little high for a lunch time snack, but it's nice that they don't skimp out on the sashimi (blessed). Tastes exactly how you would imagine it. So aiiight if you're in the mood for sushi, and wanna treat yo'self. Nothing special though. Tastes more sushi than burrito."}
{"text":"3.5  esthetically appealing, creative, fushion.  ok the burritos looked awesome but i decided to do  poke bowl.  i like their creative vision.  definately think some things can be tweaked.  i imagine newcomers to the restaurant would  need a little time in order to finalize their decision seeing as its a tad difficult to order when choosing a custom create your own meal theme.  it not that ita hard but its whether or not your tasebuds will enjoy the variety of a jumbled mess.    its a tad expensive for what it is.  also very niche.  i would come back..just not sure how frequenfly."}
{"text":"I dropped in for a poke bowl when I was in the area, and I was not impressed despite all the hype about this place. They were overcrowded on a weekday, and the staff were rather impatient in their effort to push through customers. I built a poke bowl, and was overcharged a buck or two as they included a few premium toppings which I didn't receive; I also had to ask three times for a cup of water.  The flavor of my poke bowl was rather bland, and they skimped on salmon in my bowl as they ran out of their container. I saw customers before and after me getting much larger scoops!  TLDR: At $13.99 it's pricy; you'll find many cheaper, and far better places in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Ingredients are tasty and fresh, but there's really nothing special about the sauces. I would highly recommend the burrito over the bowl: if you get the bowl version of anything you're just paying for a lot of rice and not much of the toppings. I was frustrated paying almost 15$ for a bowl where they only put a tiny spoon of topping: not even enough to go with the rice. The burrito however earned the stars. I prefer Pokito over this place"}
{"text":"Came Here on advice of a work colleague who liked her poke bowl experience. This is a better poke fast food place than poke guys on Elizabeth. More options and toppings are fresh. I just wanted a salad so I ordered a custom bowl. The vegetables are fresh although one piece of lettuce was brown. Added kale, cabbage, tamago, peppers on lettuce base with chicken and shrimp. Wasabi mayo. Lotus chips. Good size of protein. Asked for extra spicy mayo. I enjoyed this salad but it does end up pricey. Was given a stamp card for customer loyalty and a questionnaire for a free takoyaki. Servers were friendly and the line up moves fast. Will come back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"4.5, awesome poke bowls and service. I tried the classic salmon bowl and tuna bowl. The salmon bowl came with of course salmon, choice of white or brown rice, carrots, kale,fish egg,tangerine and avocado. I added crab floss (crab salad) and tempura bits to give it extra crunch. I also asked for extra sriacha mayo sauce which complemented the dish well. I would recommend to have less carrot. As for the tuna bowl, I substitute the wasabi mayo for the sriracha mayo and loved it. I would definitely be back to try the burrito. You can also customize your bowl with the other toppings such as seaweed salad, wasabi fish eggs, mango, corn, edamame etc. The joint is pretty small only about 5 seats, best to get it to go!"}
{"text":"Rolltation was pretty lit. I received a free sushi burrito from them because I reached out to them on my food ig: @to.masticator.  I scanned the menu and decided to order the Wasabi Tuna sushi burrito - $14.99. It was the most expensive, and logic dictates that the most expensive item will be the tastiest.  It contained tuna, seaweed salad, avacado, red pepper. The different flavours melded together nicely and the tuna tasted fresh.  My sushi burrito craving was satisfied, though there were strings of the seaweed salad stuck between my teeth.  This was my 2nd sushi burrito ever, and thus I'm still inexperienced in the realm of sushi burritos.  I do believe, however, that this place makes top tier sushi burritos. The one I had prior, at Sushi Style, was pitiful in comparison.  Notably, Rolltation is super small and cramped. The lineup extended right to the entrance.  Also, there are 4 seats by the window. Only eat here if you have enough self-esteem to shovel the broken bits of the sushi burrito with soya sauce dripping all over your hands and mouth in front of all the people who walk past this place and stare at you through the window.  Would I buy it again? For $15, it's rather steep for a quick lunch. Personally, it's more like a try-once-in-your-lifetime-to-see-what-the-hype-is-about place.  With that being said, def. try it out. What is hype may never die."}
{"text":"went there for poke bowl... not nearly as flavoring as the ones i got from poke guys.. and it over-priced...and you charge extra for the sauce ( i didn't understand why until I realize how blend the normal option tastes like...)"}
{"text":"My first sushi burrito, and I'm in love. The staff is nice, the place is clean and it wasn't too packed for a Saturday.   Only downside would be the price, but that's of course subjective. It's about $12-15 per burrito/bowl."}
{"text":"My friends and I were walking around looking for lunch, and I have to say, when we saw the sign for this place we were immediately intrigued and decided to be a little adventurous and try out some sushi burritos! I'm not a fan of burritos per say, but this was beyond amazing! My friend and I shared one, and for sure, half was enough for both of us. Would for sure come again, but would suggest a mobile order if your going around popular meal times because the line was quite long, but their service was great. PS take a lot of napkins because it got super messy!"}
{"text":"Not cheap, but they're good on topping variety. Lotus chips? Tom yum coconut chips? All fun stuff. Oh. Also purple colored tempura bits.   They've got a new rice burger out. I had the chicken on a friend's recommendation. The chicken was surprisingly juicy. The rice burger also held up much better than I thought it would. I credit this to the way they wrap them. They grill the rice, then torch it for an additional smokey taste. Love torched foods, so that was a really nice touch. At about $5.99, they're not expensive for the experience you're getting."}
{"text":"I was curious about their event during Thanksgiving and came out to see what the hype was all about. After waiting in line for about an hour, I was in front and ordered the tuna burrito. It was interesting to see the assembly line to make all these burritos for the huge line outside. So they had a machine to press the rice on the seaweed paper. They poured some rice on the opening at the top and the girl just simply put one seaweed paper to be pressed.  Then she passed it to the next person to put the rest of the fillings.  It was pretty fast but I didn't get a fresh one for some reason. They had a spare one sitting on the counter and by the time I took a bite, it was soggy. I was eyeing the one that was actually for my order but I was given the bait and switch. However, I would try again when I pass by the area and customize my own creation. Overall, they were pretty organized and gave away 500 burritos during the day.   There were some complaints as some people came late and the offer never mentioned that there was limited quantity.  It only mentioned that it was a limited time."}
{"text":"Really delicious Sushi Burritos! You have the option of ordering it from the menu or creating your own roll with a great variety of toppings/fillings for your roll. Its a shame there isn't much seating but i would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant! This is definitely a nice mix to the everyday food available in the downtown core. I've tried the signature 'classic salmon' and the 'teri shrimp' rolls and both are awesome. Each roll is jammed full making this a full meal and loaded with flavor.  There are a few  downside to this restaurant. The price for each roll is pretty expensive, starting roughly at $13.00 and working its way up. The other down side is that the rolls are only available in white rice. Finally, the seating sucks.   If you can afford the ticket price for one of Rolltation's awesome rolls, than give it a go!"}
{"text":"I came here around the first few weeks they first opened in mid July.  I ordered a make your own and my boyfriend had the salmon combination they had pre set.  I really enjoyed mine, the only downside was I don't think I held it correctly it fell apart! So it's quite a messy food.  But my boyfriend had no problem with his, he didn't drop one thing :/ he also love the combination of sweet, spicy and savoury in the salmon set. I thought it'd be weird to have orange in my sushi.  We came on the weekend so it they were seat available at the window, however I hear on weekdays there's quite a line.  I will try the salmon combination next time!!! All-in-All it's good that Toronto has finally opened a sushi burrito place!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food and selection. Lots of veggies and toppings just a little pricey. I know it's a HUGE sushi roll but that's the only thing separating it from a 5 nite like a 4.5."}
{"text":"I really did love this place. The atmosphere was cool and relaxed, the menu was extensive but not overwhelming. The food was AMAZING. I love the idea of a sushi roll. It was so yummy and you can customize as you like.   The issue with this spot was the price. For two burritos was $30, I was full but my boyfriend was still hungry after his."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying out the sushi burrito here and Rolltation and I had a pleasant overall experience. The sushi burrito is definitely something you have to try at least once, and Rolltation is a great place to have it (as well as for their poke bowls).   So the concept here like many places similar to Rolltation is to either select the premade combinations or go with a build-your-own (which might be a risky choice with the abundance of options). I'm somewhat disappointed by the lack of premade options provided by Rolltation - having only two fish options, and the rest being beef, chicken, tofu, shrimp. I was hoping for more fish options and I do suppose I could have built my own, but having good premade options streamlines the entire ordering ordeal.      I went with the classic salmon burrito and my first bite was a great one - one with a whole bunch of flavors and textures. You get that crunchiness of the carrots, and onions, with mild bitterness of the kale, and the creamy sriracha mayo. There was even some sweetness coming from the corn and tangerines. I would say the toppings were quite fresh here so that's a huge plus for a place like this. Surprisingly the burrito itself is quite filling despite it somewhat small size.  You do seem to easily incorporate all these components in a compact burrito. However, the end of the burrito isn't closed to it just spills all out and disintegrates when you get to the end. While I did enjoy my burrito, I wouldn't say I love it enough to regularly order it. In the end, it's just a gigantic sushi roll. My friend who ordered the same thing in the poke bowl format seemed to really enjoy it."}
{"text":"We got a classic salmon burrito and a wasabi tuna burrito this time:  * Salmon Burrito: $13.99 || Tangerine in this burrito really adds a kick! It creates an amazing combination of sweet and savory.  * Wasabi Tuna: $14.99 || The wasabi bomb in this burrito might kill your nose. They do ask for the amount of the sauce that would go in this burrito, in advance, and I did choose regular, but it was still a bit too strong. So if your wasabi tolerance is not too high, I recommend choosing less sauce for the burrito.   Overall, I would say these burritos are worth the price. They use quality sushi - I would say the sashimi they use here are much better than the ones they use at any regular ayce sushi places.   Unlike most sushi places where they overload the sushi with rice and less amount of other toppings, their burritos were fully packed with various kinds of toppings! Besides, they are even aesthetically pretty!  I would definitely go back in a near future!!"}
{"text":"This spot houses two of the latest crazes, poke and sushi burritos. It's a small place with hefty prices, but is it worth it?   Came here on a Friday evening. It's a pretty tiny place so it's mostly meant for takeout. The line had to snake outside of the door. Don't expect to dine in here because there are only 5 seats.   I ordered the tempura shrimp burrito with extra sauce. The line was starting to get really long but my order came up pretty quickly.   My first bite was amazing. Great flavour, great mix of textures. I loved the sauce. Some bites were very difficult to take, though. The seaweed wrap was hard to bite through and my final bites were a huge mess.   Was it worth it? Maybe for some people. But for me, it's hard to say. I really enjoyed it, but $15 with tax was way too hefty for a burrito that didn't even fully fill me up. 3.5/5 for me overall."}
{"text":"Went here this weekend with a friend excited because I've heard many different thoughts on this place and was ready to try it for myself. Low and behold I was disappointed, The first half of the burrito was okay, but as you finish the side wit the protein the other side is like a sad salad. Also when ordering there few of the items were out that I was excited to try.  Lastly while eating the burrito there was a fishy after taste leaving you to believe that the ingredients within the burrito were not fresh.   Overall was not impressed with the experience."}
{"text":"This place delivers with foodora, so its super convenient and they delivered it right on time! I was slightly skeptical about delivering sushi but it was fine - the seaweed wasn't soggy yet and the fish was still cold. The classic salmon, came with a good amount of fish, a ton of kale, and the puffed rice bits were cripsy - lots of textures going on here. The classic salmon was $13.99, but they are extremly filling. For lunch its a bit steep but thats the usual cost of a sushi burrito or poke around the city."}
{"text":"Tastes good, fun to eat. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but it was a fun experience!"}
{"text":"Currently my favourite poke place because of convenience and wide variety of toppings! It's ridiculously awesome that they have purple sweet potato and asparagus as veggie options! So unique! I don't know anywhere else that has that offerings for their poke bowls, or any bowl for that matter. They also have ridiculous crunch options that I find very unique. PURPLE tempura dust?! That's awesome and super tasty! The winner has to be lotus chips for me and I need that in every bowl I make! I always do build your owns because I'm a picky eater and hate being annoying swapping ingredients in their signatures. You get a protein, three veggies, three toppings (tamago, corn, mangoes, avocado ($$), crab salad ($$) and unlimited crunch options! It's a really good lunch option if you're in the neighborhood. Service is always really friendly when you visit the store too. I have to say I've been very lazy lately with the April winter and rain so I ordered from foodora twice last week. I was annoying about both orders and they were able to accommodate! My friend wanted a different protein in the signature option she chose and I wrote that in the notes. They called to tell me they don't usually do that but they will do it one time and reminded me to order the build your own next time! The second time I wrote that I wanted half salad and half rice in the special instructions and they did it!!  Which is so nice and reassured why I continue to come here."}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 9/10 Drink: n/a Service: 9/10 Value: 8/10 Hygiene: 10/10 Aesthetics: 9/10  This location is a lot easier to get to and there is more seating than the downtown location.  The sushi burrito I ordered had tuna, salmon, purple potato, asparagus, edamame, wasabi mayo, avocado, mango, tamago, tobiko, and tempura flakes. The end result was delicious as always.  The ingredients are always fresh and you don't have to have the fillers other sushi burrito places add on.   Prices are typical, around $15. Service around here is always good. They make sure your burrito is rolled properly or they'll make it again. One thing I kind of dislike is paying for avocado though, that's like a standard topping that should be in there as default. I don't mind if you add it into the regular price, just don't put it as a optional price.  Decor is much nicer than the downtown location, and the location is convenient to get to from the subway.  There is a bunch of seating, but since it's meant to be a grab and go food, this isn't too big an issue.   Always a good place to go for sushi burritos/poke."}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 9/10 Drink: n/a Service: 9/10 Value: 8/10 Hygiene: 10/10 Aesthetics: 8/10  This was my first time trying one of the sushi burritos, I ended up trying the takoyaki and the soft shell crab as well. The sushi burrito I ordered had tuna, salmon, purple potato, asparagus, cucumber, spicy mayo, avocado, mango, tamago, and bacon bits. The end result was delicious.   The ingredients were fresh and having the diversity of options makes it so you'll be able to mix and match to your personal taste. The takoyaki was fried, so the outer layer was really crispy. I thought this was great and I enjoyed it. The soft shell crab was a little over fried and could've use a little more batter.   The value is pretty reasonable for a novel eating experience. The cost is around $15 for a salad, bowl, or burrito.  There is extremely limited seating, but since it's meant to be a grab and go food, this isn't too big an issue. Since it is made to order, you may experience a line to wait."}
{"text":"First Impression ============= Modern, clean, friendly staff.  The space is open and inviting.  Food ==== Ordered the Salmon Burrito--Yummy!  Service ====== Friendly, fast, and friendly :).   Would I come back? =============== Yes!  Two thumbs up and already planning to come back with family!"}
{"text":"I had avoided this place for quite a long time; I thought it was overhyped. That was until today, when, after trying every other restaurant around Yonge Dundas, I stumbled upon Rolltation. I was like, why not, and got myself a salmon sushi burrito. Since I'm from Vancouver, I have been eating salmon and sushi for my whole life and have been (generally) disappointed by the sushi quality in Toronto. But Rolltation changed all of it.   As soon as I walked in, the kind lady gave me a menu and asked me to take my time (even though it was crowded). I decided on the classic salmon. I couldn't eat kale and spicy things, so I asked the lady if it was okay to modify some of them. She said no problem and took down all my modifications (there were about five to six)! The roll was made fresh on the spot and paying was a breeze since they took Apple Pay.   There are four seats at the place and luckily I got one. I opened my box; the roll was huge! And there were two of them! It was crunchy and the salmon tasted super fresh, and there was a LOT of salmon for the price!   I will definitely be returning for more fresh salmon."}
{"text":"Most poke shops are located in downtown, so I am glad Rolltation decided to open their second location midtown.  I had a custom tuna bowl with kimchi, corn, avocado, cucumbers, red peppers, and red onions with brown rice. Their ingredients were fresh and the bowl was pretty filling.  They only have one size for the sushi burrito and bowl which may not be filling enough for some (their bowl is the same size as the regular sized bowl from Poke Guys). Their set up is the same as chipotle. They will ask you what toppings you want to add and they will customize it per your request as your food moves down the sushi burrito assembly line. This is going to sound like a major first world problem but... I would like a piece of seaweed in my poke bowl. If sushi burritos are the same price and it has seaweed, why doesn't the poke bowl?"}
{"text":"Decided to drop by randomly and I'm so glad I did. I used to always go to Pokeguys but I'm making the switch to Rolltation! The fish are fresh and there's so many topping to choose from. I had the tuna roll with jalapeño, red onion, egg, avocado, wasabi mayo. The portion is huge and very filling. It is slightly pricey but it's so worth it. The only downside is that there's only 5 seats so you have to do take out at busy times."}
{"text":"Service was smooth,parking was a hassle due to the yonge/eglinton construction but it was manageable to park behind the small streets and walk. Being a big fan of sushi, I was excited to try a sushi burrito and it felt like heaven! finally a big handroll (maki)!! Great taste, rice was a bit warm so it wasn't as chewy as sushis, but still tasted amazing!  Their sauces saved my sushi burrito!"}
{"text":"I've only tried Rolltation once. I was extremely excited to try this new sushi burrito hype and perhaps had set my expectations a little bit too high.   The store was extremely clean, process was flawless, but does not accept debit. I had a salmon burrito to go that was cut in half. One half of the burrito was definitely tasty - full of salmon, avocado and bursting with flavor. However, the other half barely had any salmon or avocado and was instead full of veggies such as carrots. It was very bland, tasteless and I did not end up finishing it.  What made me kind of skeptical was the fact that the salmon had a piece of bone inside. I'll say that this place is tasty, but perhaps I did not have the best experience. Might give it another try and see if it gets better, but right now it's 3 stars."}
{"text":"Okay. Where do I even begin with this? We were just walking around and we came upon this place and boy am I glad that we did. So Rolltation is basically a little restaurant that has 4 seats at the window. It's basically like a subway for sushi. You can either pick whatever you want in your sushi burrito or you can pick one of the popular flavors they have, I always create my own and since I know what I like, I keep it the same way.  The staff are friendly, fast, and they pack on the stuff on your burrito. When I say it's massive, it's massive. It's by far the best sushi I've ever had and even though I'm not much of a raw fish eater, the salmon they have is perfectly cut and it doesn't taste the least bit fishy. I highly recommend coming here to try it at least once. The price is a bit higher up, but you're paying for something really cool and a different type of experience.  I really wish I lived in Toronto because I'd be coming here all the time."}
{"text":"Great environment. Food taste great. Lots of options to make your own bowl/salad/burrito"}
{"text":"This place is such a good quick eat. Huge portions. I can only finish half so I usually split with a friend or save for later. The only thing I don't like is the edime but they allow you to replace ingredients with others which is amazing and very rare. The only thing to note is there is limited seating so you might have to eat outside."}
{"text":"Almost a 3.5  It's located near Dundas and University and close to a bunch of other restaurants along the street and close to some university residences. They focus primarily on sushittos and less on poke bowls and marinating the fish itself. They price depending on how much protein you take and which toppings you opt for (e.g. avocado, crab salad, etc.)  In terms of sauces, I enjoyed the unagi (eel) sauce, and it was definitely more flavourful and sweeter than the other sauces.  The roll itself was a little sloppily made with the toppings and insides falling out even before I started eating, but they definitely don't skimp on the fillings. The sushitto gets quite messy near the end, since the sauce and fillings are all dripping and spilling out, so it's not the easiest meal to eat on the go. The store itself is very small, with only 4-5 seats along the window, so most people take their meal to go."}
{"text":"Another raw fish burrito/bowl place that popped up this year.   Located at University and Dundas...they are actually parked right next to Fugo desserts.  A relatively small but clean joint with few seating ... I think around 6 seats total.   This place is quite delicious!    I'm generally not one that enjoys over seasoned food....so I decided to choose a custom burrito from Rolltations.     I made a burrito with salmon and tuna, edamame, purple sweet potatoes, asparagus, unagi sauce, avocado (extra), wasabi Tobiko (extra), masago, crab and tempura bits.    The staff helped in making the burrito balanced with different textures....and everything was delicious!     The asparagus was cooked just right, I LOVED the purple sweet potatoes, unagi sauce gave it some flavour without being over powering, and well...the extra priced ingredients are extra priced because they are premium ingredients.  They have pork floss too as an premium ingrediant ...and I totally understand, I buy pork floss at the supermarket and it's freaking expensive!    My favourite was how fresh and healthy it all tasted, the burrito held up well and didn't fall apart....and really it was a very solid brick of food, all with ingredients I will never regret eating.   Also the most important part...the sushi rice was made right!  :-)  Price wise, you will end up paying about $13-16 or so for a bowl or burrito.   I mean for an uncut very large sushi roll....you'd pay that going anywhere.    This is a great healthy alternative at lunch."}
{"text":"I visited Rolltation on a Sunday around lunch time and to my surprise, the line wasn't bad at all. It's a very small restaurant that's more of a take-out place, but if you wait patiently the turnover rate for the 5 chairs in the front of the restaurant is pretty quick.   These are the basic options: 1. Choose a burrito, poke bowl, or salad 2. Choose a protein (raw salmon, raw tuna, beef, chicken, or shrimp). I chose salmon and it was great. 3. Veggie (max 3) - i picked cucumber, cabbage, and lettuce. In retrospect I would not get the lettuce again. 4. Sauce - went with spicy mayo 5. Topping - I chose avocado, seaweed salad, and tobiko. Unfortunately you have to pay $1 extra for \"premium toppings\" which include avocado, kani salad, and seaweed salad.  6. Crunch - I went with the lotus chip which was great!  I used my student card for a 10% discount and the final price was about $15. It was quite expensive for one burrito, but I did really enjoy it. The ingredients were fresh, there was lots of variety in what you could stuff your burrito with, and the employees were friendly and fairly efficienct. The only slight criticism I have was that the burrito was VERY difficult to eat, perhaps because the lettuce I got was causing the burrito to explode. I ended up using utensils to eat it. I would go back again, but would probably try the poke bowl next time."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying a poke bowl. I thought I would not like the combination of flavors so much. However once I took the first bite, it got better and better. I can't give it a five because I don't think fast food should cost this much. It's almost the same price as a dine in restaurant for sashimi on rice. I did enjoy the salmon bowl nonetheless."}
{"text":"How long did it take for someone to figure out the whole sushi burrito concept? All it is really is a giant sushi roll, made eschewing the normal conventions of sushi-making and served to you like a burrito. And it seems to have become a new 2016 food trend in Toronto and elsewhere, with places like Rolltation popping up quickly. Funny how Rolltation is next door to a regular kind of sushi place--the choice is yours.  At Rolltation, you can customize your order via a list of ingredients, or pick from some preconceived choices. Either way, you can have your grub in the form of a sushi burrito, or a poké bowl (yet another new food trend in the city), all of which is made fresh to order. The 'Kimchi Beef' in poke format is an interesting mix of sweetness, kimchi spicy and savoury. Filling? Yes. Affordable? No.  The place itself only seats five inside, and damn it's loud and tiny--I had a hard time articulating my order without nearly screaming. The whole business model is designed to make their customizable fast food service as efficient as possible,  but it needs work. You'll still have to snake yourself around a tight lineup in busy periods, or put up with when they have mistaken your poke bowl for a sushi burrito order or vice versa (one of the drawbacks of this have-it-one-way-or-another scheme). Who knows how long this novelty will last, but $14 is quite a lot for a simple takeout grub.  {TTC: St. Patrick subway station}"}
{"text":"Awesome! Awesome! Had classic salmon burrito. so good! People at this place are super helpful. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I tried the Classic salmon and a little bit of the Kimchi beef from my boyfriend's. It was my first time trying a sushi burrito and both my boyfriend and I fell in love with it! We were expecting it to be delicious because it looked delicious and let me tell you, it really lived up to our expectations.   I got full from one burrito and it was a bigger than I thought. There were many other options as well as a tofu one and a sushi burrito for those of you who want to stay healthy called the Skinny Sumo. They also have the option of making your own sushi burrito with the toppings listed on their menu AND the best part is that you can also make it into a poké bowl with rice as a base or a salad bowl with salad as a base, duh!   I am definitely gonna come back for more and try all of the other ones that they have!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi burritos and very generous portions. The three of us had to save our second halves for later. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been obsessed with Rolltation since it opened in my neighbourhood! The food is amazing and the quality of the ingredients is top notch. Great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I really can't express how MUCH I love Rolltation! Its first store is in downtown and quite far from my home. After the first tasting, the feeling of fresh, filling and tasty, and satisfaction, they were just lingering around my head that I even wished I lived in DT so as to go there everyday...Now it's coming nearerGood news! I love to eat Rolltation as frequently as I can!"}
{"text":"A nice and clean place to grab a unique meal. I love this sushi burrito way more than the traditional wheat burrito. The flavour of my \"skinny sumo\" burrito was fantastic. I'm so happy my expectations of this place were not let down. Because the price of these unique burritos were on the high side. I added tempura bits and lotus chip...worth the extra money!  The people that work there are friendly, especially the cashier, she was very helpful.  I will be back to try the meat fillings next time."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try my first sushi burrito but was dissapointed. I wish they had preset burritos. Once given the option to customized and aftering choosing everything I liked, it did not taste very well. Therefore it would be nicer to have pre-set menu with the option to customize."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi burritos! Really friendly and fast service. The food was fresh and the premade combos are nice."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff! I had the Salmon Classic and it was great! Fresh, crunchy, and flavorful :)"}
{"text":"Hmm what can I say except sushi tastes better in smaller rolls. I understand the appeal of a sushi burrito since you can pack in crazy things like tons of veggies in there but it doesn't taste anything like sushi. It's my personal choice that I think every bite should have a mix of flavours, instead of having blocks of single flavours. This is inevitable though, the way the roll is made. Same goes for poke bowls, they really taste nothing like sushi except having some common ingredients like raw fish and rice.  Since everything was fresh and well-made, I'm still giving 4 stars. Try it once and you'll know if you prefer it to sushi or not."}
{"text":"Rotation does a healthier version of sushi, with a lot more veggies. I like their rolls a bit more than the bowls. You can choose a variety of ingredients which were all fresh. My favorite is the salmon one. If you don't know what to pick to 'make your own', just choose one their recommended flavour combos. Also can't go wrong with avocado!  The service is pretty fast and they wrap the rolls nicely. It's a little pricey (like with a drink often comes to $15+) but I feel refreshed eating it, which is pretty high praise for 'fast food'. Portions are moderate. So I'm a regular and I do recommend it if you need a quick healthy bite but don't want a regular salad :)"}
{"text":"I AM SO GLAD I STOPPED BY! I usually eat at Cali love.. I spent $22 for a bowl there which now is a rip off and doesn't even taste as good as Rolltation. I will be a regular customer at rolltation from now on. The salmon is sooo much fresher and chunkier than Cali love. Everything about rolltation is so good!!! I'm obsessed!!!!!!!!!! So glad I stopped by because it just totally changed my life now. It only cost me $12.00 and they add so much stuff."}
{"text":"I got a kimchi beef sushi burrito. Service was fast and the food was amazing, even after I walked 26 minutes back to my destination before eating it. Plus I got an awesome stamp card! I enjoyed both the food and the friendly yet efficient service. Thank you guys! I enjoyed every bite!"}
{"text":"Unique selection of food! I tried the Temp Shrimp. Perfect blend of texture/taste. Service was quick/efficient. Was a pleasure seeing them combine all the ingredients. Word of warning! The wasabi packs will sting the sinuses (aka you'll get you got) so use sparingly!"}
{"text":"Best fresh hand-held sushi in town. I really take my liking to the classic salmon burrito (although its too big and a but hard to eat without messing up lol) and shrimp-tempura poke."}
{"text":"based on the reviews and an interest in good poke, we came here.  For $31 it was a bit pricey for what we received in terms of quality.  How can I say that?    Well, for the Tempi-shrimp we got three small pieces of shrimp tempera.    I got the create your own bowl and while it was a bonus they don't charge extra for brown rice, I noticed the one scoop of salmon I got was small (girl didn't even get a full scoop) so I got a second one.  The second scoop still had a few pieces of salmon left on the spoon and she just put it away..?!?!  It was a bit confusing as far as toppings and I found the girl making my bowl not to be that helpful.  I thought we only get 3 vegetables but then I was told we get 3 toppings as well (it's hard to read the paper because many of the toppings are extra charge).  If it weren't for that the rice was a bit generous, I would have been hungry.  Please tell your staff to give customers a full scoop of protein!  I think the two scoops I got was the equvilant of one.  Doubt we're going to come back here for this price point."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my classic salmon burrito! It was packed with healthy ingredients and salmon. The staff asked me how much sauce I wanted - less, normal, or extra. I said normal, but I wished I said extra or extra on the side because it would have tasted less bland with more sauce. In my opinion, it's similar to other poke places that I've tried, but they do not season their salmon in advance so more sauce would be good.  I liked how they cut it for you without asking. Makes it easier to eat because it could get messy. Quick service. Only a couple of seats so it's mainly a take out place.  When I went, they were only accepting cash because their machines were down. Bring cash if you can."}
{"text":"revisited and this time was way better. Special thanks to Wendy Frank and Chloe!"}
{"text":"Kind of poke'd out but since Rolltation popped up close to my work decided to give it a shot. I would say it's one of the least authentic of the Toronto poke places I've tried because I like soy based sauces and didn't see any on the sauce menu unless I'm wrong. But everything tasted fresh so can't complain about that. Got a tuna custom bowl. Gotta recommend that lotus chip for the crunch it tastes like potato chip to me, a plus!  Overall 3.5/5 because they didn't have a fancy soy based sauce, had to add the packaged soy myself. But just a personal preference, if you enjoy all the mayo based sauces you'll probably like Rolltation."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Had a sushi burrito craving and Rolltation did not disappoint! They have a great selection of signature rolls as well as an option to build you own! The rice to stuffing proportion was perfect! The salmon was super fresh as well as all the ingredients I side topped with a great sauce!! The staff is super friendly and quick with service!! Already telling all my friends to come here! Will be back again soon!!"}
{"text":"Stood at the counter, waiting in the customer in front of me to finish his order, from one of the slowesttttt servers, ever. All the while, the vacant staff just stood behind the counter, just looked around, doing nothing. Nice.  By the time my order was taken, it too was the longesttttt and most painful experience, having to repeat my request at least 3 times to someone who imho, should not be  utilized for this role.  Upon completion of my order, and asking the female clerk who's job apparently was to complete this mind numbing experience, why it took so long to have a giant roll of sushi made, she shrugged and said nothing.  Not a lot of caring in this location, nor speed. Too bad, loved their location on Dundas."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to order food in downtown toronto. It is a healthier alternative takeout place but a little overprice. The shop is quite small with very little seat (about 4 seat I believe)."}
{"text":"This is the first sushi burrito I have ever tried and it was amazing!!! Not only it's bang for your buck because the portion is huge but the ingredients used including the salmon was fresh and delicious! The flavour of the burrito was balanced and it didn't have too much rice. I definitely recommend it and would go back for a poke bowl sometime."}
{"text":"I've heard about the sushi burrito restaurants coming to Toronto for a while so I finally decided to give it a go. I have already seen the menu on its website so I already knew what to expect and what I wanted when I came in the door.   Environment: Located near Dundas St West/University near a bunch of other Japanese restaurants, Rolltation distinguishes itself as the only restaurant that offers sushi burrito as its main attraction. Like the other restaurants on Dundas, this restaurant is pretty small as well and only offers 5 window seats, so it is recommended for office workers looking want to grab a lunch quickly and leave. There is also the option to order online for pick up.  Food: They mainly offer 2 types of dishes: the sushi burrito and the poke bowl, though it seems that most people tend to get the sushi burrito. You can choose to either select from one of their curated sushi burritos or to create your own from a list of toppings. I really like that they create the food right in front of you on the spot and the ingredients are mostly pretty fresh.  I opted create your own while my friend got the classic salmon, though they both end up being around $15 after tax, which is kinda pricey if you're looking to eat here for lunch.  The dine-in experience wasn't that pleasant for me either. Even though we were lucky to come during a less busy time of the day and managed to get a seat, it was still an awkward experience. My sushi burrito was super stuffed and as I was eating it the fillings kept falling down so I had to pay attention and take small bites. Also, since they only offer window seating, that means everyone walking by is literally a feet away and can see you eating through the clear glass. It was super awkward, especially when I was already struggling to eat the sushi burrito in the first place, at the moment I wished I could have ordered the poke bowl and eat it with a fork.   Service: Overall the staffs are really nice and really tentative at explaining the ordering procedures. They offer a loyalty stamp card and they have smaller 10% off milestones before you reach 10 stamps to get a free burrito.   Due to the steep price of the sushi burrito and the awkward dine-in experience, I give it a 3 star rating, however, if you can look pass these, Rolltation is a solid sushi burrito/poke restaurant to give it a try."}
{"text":"It took long enough but I finally decided to try the latest fad: sushi burritos. (Actually, I waited so long it's probably not even a fad anymore, but I digress.)  I decided to go with the Classic Salmon (\"Salmon, Kale, Avocado, Carrot, Red Onion, Sweet Corn, Tempura Bits, Tangerine, Wasabi Tobiko; Sauce: Sriracha Mayo\").  I'll admit it looked very appealing when I first opened the little box it comes in. It's been cut in half and certainly seems to have been assembled with care. And indeed, the first bite was very, very tasty. Everything works; the big chunks of salmon are delicious, while the various components function well together. (Even the tangerine!)  I took a second, equally tasty bite but it was all downhill after that. The integrity of the burrito began to noticeably buckle after the third mouthful and by the time I reached the fifth, it had completely fallen apart on my plate. I was stuck eating individual mouthfuls of the various components with a fork. Not too pleasant.  I figured I would take a different tack with the second half by leaving it in its paper wrapping, but nope, the thing fell apart yet again (albeit not quite as quickly). And given that I paid over $15, this kind of slipshod, careless design is completely unacceptable.  So color me baffled by the ongoing success of the sushi burrito. I'll never eat another one."}
{"text":"I usually order lunch here through the Ritual App. This is the best Poke Bowl I tried so far as I like to build my own bowl. And they have a lot of ingredients and variety to choose from compared to other places. This place is very generous with their portions and the ingredients are fresh. I usually get with no protein since it's cheaper and I like to pick my own items.   Roll your own- No Protein ($8.49)  - White Rice  - Edamame - Sweet Corn - Carrot  - Kale - Tangerine - Tempura Bits ( A Must!! Purple Bits)  - Seaweed Salad (Add $1 but so worth it)  - Regular Mayo Sauce Total $10.72"}
{"text":"Do you feel like a baller and want to try a unique sushi experience in your mouth? Well then, its time to try out Rolltation.  I had the Salmon Burrito here and it was very delicious and fresh. Its very neatly packed together and looks great for taking a picture of for instagram.  I really like how they make your burrito in front of you and that there is the option of selecting whats in your burrito if you are on the pickier side.   Some of the cons of this place is that it is pretty small and theres nowhere to sit. I had to take my food to go before enjoying it. You are also paying 15 bucks for something that won't make you full assuming you don't have a small appetite. This is excluding a drink.   In the end, I recommend everyone to try out this place at least once. Oh ya, unless you don't like raw fish, yum."}
{"text":"Great place to pick up some poke bowls!   Ordered the classic salmon salad bowl and boy that was good! Their portions are big, so it was definitely hard to finish the whole bowl and everything tasted so fresh!  Love the tangerines in there, as it adds a bit of sweetness to it! Definitely will be back to try the other items on the menu..."}
{"text":"Great service, fresh ingredient! You won't get wrong to eat here! Wasabi Tuna is my favourite!!! Will come back for more!"}
{"text":"although the food was ok, for the same price you might as well go to a  AYCE sushi spot which will allow more variety. not saying anything negative, the food at Rollnation was good, but trendy and quality must not be confused."}
{"text":"This place has super fresh food and I LOVED the poke bowl. The salmon was delicious. I did not think the sushi burger was very good-just alright and kinda small. We had the Korean meat one. The cashier did not get our order right and it was confusing, and they also didn't charge as properly at the end (it was in our favor but I still corrected them and paid the extra 2 dollars). So a little confusing but really good food!"}
{"text":"I went here based on the reviews on Yelp and it didn't disappoint. The service was wonderful and the most amazing part is that you get to build your own bowl. I went all out building my own salmon poke bowl with brown rice, added seaweed salad (+ $1.5) and Avocado (+$1.5) with Kimchi, carrots, kale, pumpkin seeds, and topping it off with Wasabi mayo.   It was the best thing I've ever tasted. It just goes to show that good tasting food can also be good for your health. They're also giving away cards to collect stamps so you can get 10% off from time to time and one free item when you collect 10 stamps.  This place has won me over. I'm now a fan."}
{"text":"I love multiculturalism, and nothing spells multicultural like fusion cuisine. Rolltation is an amazing example of why it's great to be in a city like Toronto. It's home to the sushi burrito and a variety of 'Poke' Bowls.   The fillings are the real stars here, as they're fresh, plentiful and of of a seemingly endless variety. There's both traditional options (wasabi, avocado), and a little bit more ... let's say inventive (mango, cheetos, etc.).  The portions are a good size, with the poke bowls having a surprisingly good amount of sushi in them. All the variety will keep me coming back.  Actually, it's so good, that I can see myself incorporating this into a regular lunch spot. At least until I try all 12 of their sauce options!"}
{"text":"Really good, my favourite is the salmon burrito (modified to accommodate an egg allergy). They accommodate allergies and have allergy menus attached to their regular menus.   Note: if you have food allergies, make sure to remind them to change/wash the knife! They use the same knife for all the sushi burritos, so there will be serious cross contamination if they don't change the knife."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a different take on sushi, Rolltation should be your next restaurant to visit. This place has everything...sushi, takoyaki, hipsters. Just kidding (not really). As a newbie to the sushirito experience, I ordered the takoyaki (fried squid balls) and the classic salmon burrito. The takoyaki was savory with a light fried texture. Was not a fan of the smoked and shaved bonito topping so I'd ask for that to be omitted next time I order it. To the main event, the burrito was massive and unfortunately I couldn't unhinge my jaw to do it justice. As I ate it like a typical burrito, it fell apart. Not a bad thing. I just ate the rest of it with chopsticks. I recommend the bowl as those customers eating them at the restaurant seemed to eat it with ease. The tempura bits added a crunch for texture. You may want to ask for extra if you love that crunch in every bite. The seating area was limited but burritos in general are an \"on the go\" food, so that is expected. Staff was extremely friendly and was able to answer questions I had as I ordered. Overall, for a meal that fills the belly without any of the guilt, give Rolltation a visit. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The first time I heard about this place, I knew I had to try it. I went on Saturday around lunch time, and the place was packed with a line. The service was really quick and the wait was not as bad as it looked. The 'make your own' menu was a bit intimidating so I chose to go with the pre-made ones. I'm a picky eater, so I chose to go with the Classic Salmon Sushi Burrito. Unfortunately, they ran out of salmon, so I had it substituted with Tuna instead. The burrito came to approximately $15, with no additional add-ons. My boyfriend got the Wasabi Tuna Bowl.   The burrito was good, it had a good amount of tuna and not too much rice, like you'd find at other places. However, they did put a bit too much spicy mayo. As for the Wasabi Tuna Bowl, it was good, however my boyfriend was slightly disappointed that he was given exactly 2 lotus chips."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place after an appt. Poke bowls are one of my favourite lunches and I just ate a bowl of sunshine.  I had the salmon poke bowl make your own: Salmon White rice Carrots Tomato Corn Mango  Mandarins Pumpkin seeds Teriyaki mayo  (If I had noticed the avocado then I would have added that too).  So delicious and quick. Restaurant was spotless."}
{"text":"Oh man. So good. I did a roll your own salmon burrito with jicama, jalapeno, red onion, avocado, mango, ginger and spicy mayo... And the purple-coloured tempura bits.  Drizzled in some good old soy sauce and it was pure heaven. Even better than expected. Fresh ingredients, perfect proportions. A bit messy at the bottom but ate every bite!  Next time I am going to do a Korean take: beef with kimchi, carrot, and whatever else I am feeling!"}
{"text":"Having the chance to build a huge sushi.. or a burrito sushi (however you want to call), it's amazing! Fulfilling a dream Hahahaha It's really actually filling, it's big! I couldn't even finish one burrito by myself.  The ingredients seems to be fresh and they use a good quality of fish. I say that because I had visited places that the salmon was not too fresh, or they used bad parts from the fish. But at Rolltation they definitely did a great job! The place is clean and people are kind and patient to explain how it works and to help you to build the best burrito. If you love sushi as I do, you cannot miss it!"}
{"text":"Wow what a cool place with an awesome spin on sushi!  Must visit if you want to try something new and delicious.  Friendly service and great take out option."}
{"text":"Most delicious bowls. I don't know what they put in there, but they are so scrumptious. Can't go wrong with any selection. It tastes healthy and it's good!"}
{"text":"First off I respect the concept of this place Mexican and japanes fusion.  I wanted to know what the hype was all about with the sushi burrito and I think this is one of the few places that serve this burrito. There are many options like poke guys very similar to sushi burrito. I had spicy salmon with a bunch of toppings make sure to not pay extra for toppings that charge extra unless you like them. The price is a bit steep 15 dollars for one burrito I definetly  don't think k that is really worth it. It's a good place to try for the first time but afterwards I think people will get tired of it."}
{"text":"I heard about the Sushi Burrito food truck, but it was hard to track it down. Finally there's a physical store! I love seafood, so I went for the on the go poke bowl with shrimp as its main focus. At first I thought the bowl was pretty small, but when I finally finished it I was really full! The flavour was great! Definitely looking forward to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place and lined up a couple weeks after it opened. So basically, it's a large sushi roll that's only been sliced once.   Overpriced for what it is. I'd rather just buy sushi that's well made. This was hard to eat, as the sauce started dripping through the paper.   I think the high marks from others are probably from burrito lovers who enjoy the asian twist. Nice idea, but don't count me as a fan.   2 stars out of 5.  Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food: [*] Disappointed, and somewhat offended. [**] Not very good. Will not return.  [***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality.  [****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints.  [*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! It's a bit small & doesn't have much seating room, but it's adorable and the food is delicious :)  My friend and I each ordered a \"make your own\" burrito. Total for each burrito was about $16, as we each got one extra topping (+$0.50). They were huge and definitely very filling. The ingredients they use are very fresh as well. Staff are also extremely friendly.  They seriously don't go lightly on your burrito either. Had so many toppings that my burrito fell apart after a few bites (not that i mind, the more toppings the better)."}
{"text":"Super fresh sushi burritos! This is the place I come to satisfy my cravings for seaweed wrapped goodness. Their portions are really big, even a regular roll was difficult to finish. That's all because of the huge amount of toppings they pack inside their rolls.   I usually get the classic salmon which comes with kale and tangerine amongst a lot of other stuff. I've never had kale and tangerine in a roll before, it makes the roll taste like a summer salad, light and fresh. I also tried their new korean beef rice burger. These take longer for them to make and I would say its just one of those novelty foods that I'd try once and happy not to try again. It was a bit too salty and rice patties just can't compete with fresh buns.   They can get pretty busy during lunch times from walk ins and also online orders. They have 4 spots for sitting but definitely more of a pickup and go kinda place."}
{"text":"I don't have enough good things to say about r Rolltation. The ingredients are super fresh, portions are super generous, and above all, the quality is very consistent. The signature sushi burritos have excellent combinations. If you recognize that it's a mom and pop shop, and is ok with the limited seating, the food is truly excellent! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I grabbed two poke bowls to go. It's kind of pricey for what it is $15 but we wanted something healthier without compromising on taste (& I love all things sushi with a passion). I also work in one of the downtown hospitals and this place was nearby. Therefore adding everything up, this was the perfect place to hit up. I digress...  I ordered 2 signature bowls. Classic Salmon & Wasabi Tuna. The Classic Salmon tastes much better in our opinion. The combination of toppings and flavours was more appealing. The tempura bits really made the bowl come together and taste more savoury. So if you build your own bowl, don't forget the tempura bits!   The wasabi tuna fell kind of short for me especially because it wasn't spicy enough and a bit more bland when comparing with the salmon. I did enjoy the seaweed salad that part of the wasabi tuna though so next time I'd just add that to the classic salmon.   The staff at Rolltation are cheerful and nice. It can take some time to complete your order so it makes a difference when you see them working as a team.   For the instagrammers & foodies who love taking photos, their bowls are photo worthy too. Bright and colourful."}
{"text":"Anyone who personally knows me, knows that I LOVE sushi. And when I heard that a sushi burrito and poke bowl joint was opening up walking distance from my workplace, naturally I had to scope it out. I've had their classic salmon sushi  burrito twice now and each time I was not disappointed.   The restaurant itself is quite small, seating at maximum about 5-6 people. If you can, it's best to get take out or come during off hours.   As for the main attraction, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they didn't skimp out on the toppings. The sushi burrito for me was very filling, I was only able to finish half of the burrito before saving the rest for an evening snack. There is a good amount of fish to vegetable ratio so you're not left with a mouthful of kale at every bite.   Overall, I will come back again to try their poke bowls based on my first two positive experiences."}
{"text":"I'll admit I didn't buy into the hype of sushi burritos. I'd imagined them to be overstuffed handrolls, with the star of the show (the seafood) being buried under the vibrant mass of toppings. I ordered some overy delivery just to give it a try and along with the burritos, I ate my words. We got the classic salmon and wasabi tuna and went halvsies.  Every bite from different angles had different proportions of the ingredients, keeping consuming it as a whole interesting due to the non-uniformity of it. The fish was reasonably fresh as much as I could taste it through the sauces. The ingredients were very similar to those of a poke bowl and it honestly felt like I was eating one in a very compact form.  The salmon probably my favourite, with the corn, carrot, and tangerine providing a surprisingly pleasant sweet twist. The kale kind of bolstered the nori and held all the flavours together. Not a huge fan of wasabi but overall, the tuna was alright. Just near the end it got messy and I wish there were a solution, whether through packing or the manner in which the nori wraps is could better contain the mess as I'm left with dripping morsels that I'm forced to stuff into my mouth. Overall, rolltation changed the way I see this food and now I'm more open to try their other varieties."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times. The variety and freshness of toppings is great. I also really like that they have a beef option. I've tried most of the sauces, and haven't found any that I really love. I usually end up putting soy sauce on everything. I always get the poke bowl, and since they re-opened the portion size has decreased substantially (the bowls now seem to be about 2/3 of the size that they used to be, and it also was not filled as full as they were in the past). The amount of food is more than enough for me, but beware people with big appetites- you might need to look elsewhere for your poke fix."}
{"text":"I got the Wasabi Tuna Burrito and I have to say I was rather disappointed.  Being quite literally next door to a place that gives an ample amount of decent sushi for just $5 I was hoping the $15 purchase would leave me satisfied, it didn't. It wasn't filling and the flavors weren't all that amazing. Despite the wasabi mayo, the burrito tasted rather plain, the tuna didn't have give off that fresh taste you really look for when you have sushi.  The service was rather quick but given my first impression and the lack of perceivable value, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Checked out the new sushi burrito place that just opened up today around Dundas and University. Customers can choose either a burrito or a poke bowl and you can choose one of the items on their menu or create your own meal based on the ingredient options they have. We tried the classic salmon burrito and the wasabi tuna burrito. They were a bit on the pricey side as the salmon one cost  $13.99 plus tax and the tuna one was $14.99 plus tax. The rolls were filled with a lot of ingredients though. I preferred the salmon roll as it had spicy mayo sauce. The tangerine in the salmon roll gave it a juicy kick as well. The tuna one was not bad. I liked the seaweed bits in it. Service was quick and there were a few seats available along a counter by the window."}
{"text":"Rolltation offers up burrito, poke and salad bowls in the $10-12 range. Food is fresh, tasty, and the portions are a good size.   The build your own features pretty much allow for an infinite amount of combinations. Customers start off with a meat, add 3 veggies, sauces, toppings and then crunch toppings.   The meat looks freshly cooked (I had chicken and it was nicely toasted unlike Subway pieces). I highly recommend the Spicy Sesame sauce and Mango sauce. I also recommend the Garlic crisps if you're looking for a bit of crunch.   Soy sauce and Wasabi are available on the side. A warning though, the wasabi is pretty deadly (compared to other places)!"}
{"text":"I went there expecting the best thing possible and it was exacly what i got!!! :D   Everything was done really quickly and the attendants were really polite, the food is amanzily good !  I extremely recommend!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to sushi burrito from the food trucks. Always thought it was a cool concept and somehow, these burritos always make me feel like I'm getting more fish than regular sushi rolls.  Tried Rolltation for the first time yesterday. Line up was not bad on a Tuesday night. Of course they have some set burritos like the classic salmon, but what was cool was that you can create your own. You also have a choice to get a bowl version (think classic burrito and burrito bowls).  I created my own bowl with salad because I'm lame and on a \"healthy\" diet. The concept reminds me of Subway where you get to choose your toppings, but choose wisely, you only get 3 options. Avocadoes cost an additional dollar as well.   The food was fresh and tasty - I don't think I have anything to complain about here.  Two downsides I have to mention. First, the girl that took my order. She was just confused about the build your own menu, made several mistakes and didn't know how to communicate. I had to explain the menu to her and I'm the first time customer. Second was that they had 5 seats. That's it. If you plan to try this place, get it to go.   Price is not cheap, but it's competitive to the food trucks. If you dish out $16 for a sushi burrito at a food truck, you can do that here too - and you get a stamp card! :)"}
{"text":"Barely any meat. Not that good. Rather have actual sushi for the price. Instant regret"}
{"text":"Always a treat to eat here! I work relatively close by, and on occasion I would treat myself to a classic salmon burrito from Rolltation. The ingredients may sound weird when you first read them, but they definitely work! I always get extra sauce on my burrito (can't get enough of that sriracha mayo) and it's so flavourful it makes even kale (my least favourite) taste good. The prices are kind of steep for sushi, but the burrito is a good size. If I'm not super hungry I can get away with eating the burrito for two meals. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"These sushi burritos are huge. I was only able to finish half of it for a meal. It felt like a bigger version of the regular sushi with more ingredients.  I got the kimchi beef burrito and it was very delicious. They made sure to stuff as many ingredients inside as possible, so everything was densely packed. Every burrito includes a good amount of meat and vegetables.  You can ask them to customize your burrito if there are certain ingredients you don't like.  It's a great location but a tiny tiny store. I would definitely suggest to buy it and take it to go."}
{"text":"This location is the one to go to! I went to the one downtown and wasn't impressed, the young and Eg one is new and the staff are SO NICE! My friend got a sushi burrito and I got the make your own poke bowl. BEST poke , better than Cali Love for sure. The staff are helpful, sweet and generous. I love how when you ask for water they give it to you from a fridge in a cup not tap water. I will absolutely return... And tell all my friends. Thanks so much!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome little spot which is currently my #1 poke/sushi burrito joint in the city. They don't exactly have a prime space for sitting down to enjoy your food, but they might be changing that with the current renovations? anyway..  Rolltation's portions are massive! A full sushi burrito is more than enough to make you want to reach for that blanket underneath your seat and call it a day at the office. The poke bowls on the other hand, while they pack what seems to be the same amount of food, doesn't feel quite as heavy on the stomach. Probably because you have the option of not going through all that rice. The sauces they offer are great, and their stamp card loyalty program's pretty sweet too. I've never done a delivery using foodora since it's a nice way to get out of the office and walk, but that might change once the cold weather rolls around.   Definitely a little pricey however for an everyday lunch. But having it once a week as a Friday meal to treat yourself for surviving the work week, it's not bad!"}
{"text":"I bought the classic salmon burrito, me and my aunt shared! In total it was about 15 bucks. Students that are in school, please bring your student card for an extra 10% off your purchase at the cashier! Loved the food here and I would be definitely be coming back for more when I come to downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"Finally saw that it was open, so decided to grab a quick bite to eat today.  Went with the Wasabi Tuna burrito, which came with wasabi mayo, red bell peppers, lettuce, seaweed salad, avocado, tamago, and lotus chips.  The flavour of everything was nice and fresh enough, and the lotus chips were an unexpected but delightful surprise.  The only thing I would say that I wish was different were the size of the lettuce and red bell peppers used in making the burrito.  It starts to become pretty overwhelming, and after the first 2 or 3 bites, it's more like eating a strange salad with a bit of tuna and wasabi taste.  I also didn't get the mouthful of fresh tuna sashimi that I was craving.    Next time if I decide to go again, I'll probably go with making a custom roll where I can avoid having those two particular ingredients.  I guess I'd just made the assumption that they (the raw ingredients) would probably have been cut a bit smaller or maybe done in a different way to make the whole burrito seem a bit more cohesive.    The restaurant itself is small, clean, and cute.   It's made pretty much for takeout only, and the line does move quite quickly (~7 minutes from order to cash out), which is another plus for efficient service.  I'm just saying, for the high price of this burrito, I wish it was put together with a little more finesse."}
{"text":"I went to the Rolltation restaurant near Yonge and Eglinton. The restaurant is nicely decorated. This was the first time I been to a Rolltation location, but I have eaten sushi burritos before.  I was in a hurry so I ordered the salmon burrito. The problem is that the service is lacking. It was difficult to order because the workers never look at you or says anything. I wasn't sure if the burrito they were making was my burrito or not. It was like ordering from a robot.  I got my salmon burrito and it was ice cold. I think all the ingredients were kept in the fridge to keep fresh and were never at room temperature. It was eating ice cream burrito.  Would I go go back? Maybe because I like eating burritos."}
{"text":"Money well spent, for just $16 you too can make your sushi dreams come true with this HUUGEE, delicious, and fresh sushi burrito.. om nom nomm!  I tried the classic salmon, and it was just so good, they put tangerine pieces in it, which was strangely the best evaaarrrr !"}
{"text":"Call me a sushi purist, but i feel this whole sushi burrito thing is just an overhyped, and over priced gimmick on something that doesn't need to be messed around with. Id rather have a good fresh piece of raw tuna on rice, soy sauce and little wasabi. Good sushi isnt cheap, but i think just under $16 for the tuna wasabi burritoi I had, is a bit high for what it is. I guess the ingredients are more expensive than what a mexican burrito would cost...but if i wanted a burrito type of meal...i'll just stick with a burrito at $10, and eat sushi at a proper sushi restaurant. It's nothing against this place in particular, cuz the ingredients seemed fresh, but more just about experimenting with a type of food that shouldn't be. In Japan, there are no dynamite and dragon rolls, and there are no sushi burritos. Keep it real and give me a otoro nigiri any day. Rant over. Lol."}
{"text":"Why am I so picky? Do you have that problem where you ask yourself, what should I eat today and it takes forever for you to decide? If so, thank god I am not the only one! I have walked by this time plenty of times and have been meaning to try it. I guess, I needed some encouragement to come here, so thanks, co-worker!   Order 3.7/5: Classic Salmon Poke w/kale, avocado, carrot, red onion, corn, tempura bits ($15.81 w/tax) - When I was ordering, all the ingredients looked fresh, so it appeared to be a great start - Customer service was good and employees had good team work to ensure food was made right/efficient - I really enjoyed the tempura bits because they were crispy/crunchy. I was given lots of ingredients and liked the salmon - felt kind of disappointed because there was not enough sauce (my fault for asking for a little) - Overall, I felt it the food was ok, This is the 3rd sushi bar/poke place I have been to within the last month and this is my #2. Sometimes, you can't just write off a restaurant/establishment because you ordered 1 thing and you thought it was ok. Have to try more things to actually have a fair/valid opinion. Next time, I'll come back for a sushi burrito and try something new on their menu  Helpful hints/tips - Address: 207 Dundas Street W (major intersection is Dundas/University - head east on Dundas towards the Eaton Centre if you are coming from the west end) - Seating: this is more of a take-out place. There are about 5 seats facing towards the street if you are lucky enough to snag one - Methods of Payment: Cash, credit card, debit  - Parking: you are better off taking public transit and/or walking there - Pick up/takeout: Yes, If you limited time for lunch, a good idea would be to use Ritual/Foodora."}
{"text":"What a great lunch spot! I've been to this location several times now and they have never disappointed. For about $12-15, the Classic Salmon burrito is a must try - this rice and seaweed wrap is stuffed to the max with a load of ingredients such as avocado, kale, and tempura bits that deliver an amazing combination of flavours in every bite. The raw salmon is fresh and they do not skimp out on quantity. The poke bowl alternative is slightly less messy but is just as tasty and filling.  The lines can get a bit long and the place is quite small, but they are relatively quick. Just don't expect a comfy seating area - this is more of a take-out option. But if you're craving sushi, you will definitely get your money's worth!"}
{"text":"Sushi burritos are all the rage right now in Toronto--I'm not buying it. However, hubby wanted to go so we went. This small pop-up is on Dundas St W near all the trendy Japanese matcha and cheesecake stuff. The store is quite small but has four sit-down stools facing the window out onto the street. The staff are super friendly and inviting.   We ordered the #1 Classic Salmon burrito and #2 Tuna Wasabi poke. There was only one \"chef\" making the burritos so I would imagine if there is a line, there would be quite a wait. Fortunately there were only 2 customers in front of us so it didn't take long. I do want to point out that the other workers (despite not making the burritos/pokes at this time) were helping to swap out the plastic rollers to ensure cleanliness and no contamination between each dish. There is also make your own sushi burrito and poke, but I wanted to try what their flavour combinations were like based on their own chef made menus.   For both dishes, each ingredient tasted fresh. The salmon and tuna were sadly cut up into small bite portions and scooped into each dish. However the fish tasted fresh. Personally, the first bite of the burrito with the sauce was flavourful. The Salmon burrito had salmon, kale, avocado, carrot, red onion, sweet corn, tangerine, wasabi tobiko and spicy mayo. Honestly, the first bite was pretty flavourful. There was enough salmon to the rice and the red onion brought out sweetness, crunchiness and tartness. There was enough avocado and the kale didn't overpower with its bitterness. Finishing the burrito however, was another ordeal. By the time we finished, all I tasted was the mayo. Too much. I finished the dish with heaviness and taste of mayo, rather than of sushi.   Next the wasabi tuna poke (\"salad\"): tuna, green lettuce, red peppers, avocado, seaweed, salad, tamago, lotus chip and wasabi mayo. Biggest problem with this dish is they stuff all the ingredients into a tiny plastic container. There is no way to eat this mixed or blended together properly--so you end up eating a bunch together. So, not a great dish. If they had a larger bowl to properly mix the ingredients together, it'd be fine. Each ingredient was nothing special. And again, way TOO much mayo.   My last thought: the sushi burrito is a nice trend and may last for instagram foodies but the flavour isn't enough. I don't buy the hype. It was alright but I don't think I'd try again."}
{"text":"Been to a few sushi burritos/ poke places and I found that rolltation's was average. I got a regular poke bowl with two scoops of protein, spicy mayo, crab salad, avocado, and corn. For the price you pay compared to other poke/sushi burritos places I would say it's worth it. The amount of food served in a bowl is a bigger portion compared to other poke joints. The only thing that I didn't like was that the salmon was not fresh at all. I could feel myself getting sick while eating it. With other joints I've witnessed them cutting the fish fresh.   In conclusion, if you're not picky and you want a poke fix I would recommend this place but if you're looking to have a good DELICIOUS bowl of poke then this place isn't for you."}
{"text":"So glad I decided to go to Rolltation for my first sushi burrito experience! It met my (high) expectations, and was extremely delicious. The restaurant's aesthetics were very nice as well, clean white brick walls, exposed ceiling and neon signage. Very on point with trends. Thankful for the 10% student discount as well ;-)   I appreciated their choose-your-own burrito option, as I'm very picky and like having the freedom to choose all of the toppings. I got: salmon, potato, edamame, cucumber, mango, cheese, corn, and tempura bits. It filled me up more than I thought it would! It has a pretty good circumference too - some other sushi burritos places seem a bit too thin. Anyway, it was a delicious burrito and I will definitely be back! I want to try the poké bowl next!"}
{"text":"Poke bowl heaven!!!! I love how fresh everything tastes! I normally order the salmon poke bowl with extra spicy mayo and no onions. I've tried the salmon burrito once before, but I don't like how messy it gets, however portion wise, I feel like the burrito is larger than the bowl!"}
{"text":"Make your own sushi burrito! You can add a variety of different toppings. More ingredients than rice. Very filling and satisfying. Best sushi burrito in Toronto so far.  A bit pricey tho. Around $15 for a customized burrito depending on what you get."}
{"text":"Honestly it tastes very good and the resto is clean and servers are friendly but I just paid $16 after tax for a salmon sushi burrito. That's a little too pricey for fast food style IMO"}
{"text":"Every once in a while I crave poke bawl but my quest to find the perfect place is yet to fail me :c"}
{"text":"My best friend brought me here cause I wanted to try the poke bowl. I eventually got the sushi burritos, but damn they're huge. They're essential enlarged sushi rolls but with more stuffing inside.   I got the salmon sushi burrito, and it was stuffed with a lot of different toppings such as avocado, mandarin(weird but yummy), corn, fried batter(tastes like shrimp tempura crumbs), vegetables and carrot.  I ate half of it and had to bring the other half home cause it was really filling. The sushi burrito is about 15$ plus tax. Students can get 10% off with student ID.  There's only a few seats for dining in so I suggest take it to go unless you wanna stand and eat."}
{"text":"This is the fourth location of the popular Rolltation chain. I like the decor here and even thought he place is relatively small it does the job. Tried out their new Rice Burgers and found that the pricing is quite reasonable for what it is. The Rice patties are torched for crispiness and an extra layer of flavour which is very nice. My favourite was definitely their Chicken Terayaki Rice Burger.  Of course, they have their usual delicious sushi burritos and poke bowls as well.  Overall, a good place for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Great Food!. Appear from New Jersey and it was worth the trip. Wish there were some like this down by us"}
{"text":"Sushi burritos are definitely one of those things where you look at yourself and ask \"hey maybe I should try this?\" And the choice of getting is worth it. It's a good snack to split with someone you love. Service was speedy, creating your own burrito was creatively fun overall I shall give this place 8.5 rolls out of 10 rolls #RollCanada150"}
{"text":"Sushi burritos have been viral over my feeds. So I have been looking for a place and it finally arrived in toronto. Conveniently opened next to an ice cream spot, so it was perfect for a summer night to grab and go.  They only had a bar table by the window and three stools if i remember correctly. So I wasn't able to grab a seat and had to take it to go. There was also a huge line since everything was made to order. But i liked it!"}
{"text":"Rolltation is pretty ordinary. It actually reminds me of Freshii but with a Japanese ingredient theme. You can make your own burrito, poke, etc. The burrito actually is like a messy kind of oversized maki but it's not cut into pieces like maki is. As most people know, maki is arranged pretty carefully & when they cut it looks neat besides being delicious. The burrito has the sushi rice base & then the rest of the ingredients are just piled on top. Then they roll the whole thing together & secure with a wrapping. I was afraid my burrito was going to fall apart but it didn't. It's a decent piece of food to eat. Certainly healthier than some of the other options in the Yonge/College area."}
{"text":"I went to Rolltation before 3pm and it was barely busy and there were only one person in front of me. Staff was really helpful and friendly and they will guide you through their process if it's your first time. If you are a student and have a student ID, you will get 10% off!!! I ended up getting the Teri-Shrimp burrito substituted the teriyaki sauce for spicy mayo. It tasted delicious and healthy! Spicy mayo was barely spicy and the shrimp and kani salad was delicious! Will come back again to probably try their Classic Salmon burrito!"}
{"text":"This place is more like a grab to go type of place.  Their seating includes 4 bar chairs along the window, so don't expect to get a seat in there.  We got here on a weekday night at 8pm. It wasnt very busy during that time, therefore we manage to get two of those 4 chairs. Ordered the Classic Salmon burrito, Wasabi tuna burrito and an order of soft shell crab.  It did take awhile for them to make our food, so i can imagine it can be a long wait if the place gets busy.  The burrito is quite big, good quality and quantity of fish inside! Eating the burrito might be difficult and messy. My stuffings keep falling out, i end up eating the fillings individually. Soft shell crab on the other hand, i wasnt a fan of.  It was soggy, and not much seasoning. I would come back for the burrito, afterall their fish is fresh, rice isn't overpower by vinegar."}
{"text":"I came in hoping to try one of their sushi burritos after feeling pretty stressed at school with midterms and such. I got myself the personalized sushi burrito which included salmon as the base and a ton of other veggies.   Let me tell you, their ingredients are all fresh and the final presentation was perfect. The combo of ingredients I went for probably did not compare to their \"Classic Salmon\" but I was quite satisfied."}
{"text":"Fancy roll, highly customizable. However the roll could be a bit hard to eat when you almost finish it. It falls apart and they only way to finish it was with spoon =(. It's also super filling and I can't finish all of it. Hope that they could have a smaller serve."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying a poke bowl and it was delicious. It was a huge bowl of fresh ingredients and a burst of all sorts of flavours. We got the classic salmon and wasabi tuna bowls (which were the two most popular signature bowls on the menu according to a worker). Would definitely recommend the classic salmon to anyone!   Great and friendly service as we were greeted enthusiastically right away and the food was prepared quick. There's limited settings available (~5-6 seats by the window), so this place is mostly meant for take out. You can also order online before pick up to avoid waiting in line."}
{"text":"After all of the sushi burrito hype, I finally got around to trying one at Rolltation for lunch. I ordered the classic salmon burrito, and was pleasantly surprised at how well the flavour combination worked. There was just enough rice (not too much), and I really enjoyed the crunch of the kale. My one complaint was the avocado was sliced too large and the size made it a bit overwhelming. Otherwise, I was impressed. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This has great and generous sushi burritos, friendly staff and quick service. Order before to have it ready quick. I prefer the sushi burrito over the poke bowl as I find it has more food and tastes better because of the way the ingredients mix, but poke bowl is bets I guess if you prefer less mess and contained. Delicious good every time."}
{"text":"I was just a bit curious about the sushi burrito craze.. so I went to try one. The salmon burrito I got was reallllly filling and was pretty delicious... I like how they snuck in the tangerine pieces- it added a small, interesting punch of citrus. At $15 it's not exactly cheap but just thinking about it makes me start drooling so I guess that says something!"}
{"text":"Just tried my first sushi burrito and it was fantastic. I got the salmon burrito minus tangerine and added crab (kani) salad. I was skeptical of having kale and carrots in the wrap, but they added a great sweetness and crunch. Can't wait to try out other classic combos!"}
{"text":"EDIT: Place is closed for renovation since Sept 7 until... not sure. It's too bad it doesn't mention that anywhere - had to go on their Twitter to see this.  Leaving my old review here:  I just had two of their burritos. Classic salmon and the tuna! They're likely your two cheapest and best bang for buck.  Let's start with the good.  1) Fresh ingredients: brightly lit so you can take a real good look at what's going into your food 2) Friendly staff: I brought my corgi and they let him into the venue. We were really happy because it was so hot outside and our corgi just lay flat on the cool tiles. Super happy that the staff were so accomodating for our puppy :) 3) Clean venue: new and brightly lit, no complaints with their decor/cleanliness  However, here are some things they can work on. I want to stress that none of them are major detractors. I can see why these are issues as a consumer but I would still come back because of the pros!  1) Slow: it's not their fault because it's made to order and you're paying for freshly made sushi  - but if you've only got 5 minutes for a quick bite before class/work, let them know you'll be running late 2) Price: again, not really their fault - $14-20 for a sizable amount of seafood and fresh vegetables so expect to be paying a premium! This also has to do with their prime location/lease and the cost of food. It's going to feel expensive paying this much but just remember you're not just paying for your food. You're paying for their hidden costs like lease, utilities, wages, marketing, etc.   Verdict: I'll be back but not anytime soon. It's a little out of my price range. But if you've got dollar dollar bills, come here for tasty, fresh, sushi that's made to order!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! The salmon is SUPER fresh and they don't skimp on it. We also ordered the beef, which was tasty, just didn't wow us like the salmon did.   The staff is also incredibly friendly and patient. Not even batting and eye when I asked to change my order last minute, only to change my mind a second later.   This place is also just down the street from the library which is also fantastic! Since we were there for TCAFE, we got in and out in no time.  Overall, a very positive experience! We hope to stop by again the next time we are in downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"Walked past here hundreds of times so I decided to try it out one day. I got the classic salmon poke bowl and I was a bit disappointed. They only had 1 size and the bowl didn't fill me afterwards. I found that it had way too many toppings and it gave away from the actual poke. For the price I paid for the bowl, which read nearly $15, I did not find it worth it I'm an avid poke guys fan and after trying this out, I'd rather stick with PG. As for service, it was really good and they were patient since my friend and I were staring at the menu for quite a while haha. Wish there were more seating besides the windowstill."}
{"text":"I LOVE sushi and as soon as I heard about sushi in burrito form, it got my taste buds tingling.  I was torn when I was approached with the options of having a sushi burrito and a poke bowl... in the end, I decided to go with the burrito. For my first sushi burrito, I ordered the Classic Salmon while my friend ordered the Wasabi Tuna. We swapped our halves and here's my verdict:  Classic Salmon: I was quite skeptical of having tangerines in my savoury foods but, I love trying unusual pairings. I must say,  the tangerines added a kick to the overall savoury experience. You get a hint of the freshness from the salmon; a hint of spice from the wasabi; and saltiness (if you add soy sauce) and as you work your way through the burrito, you'll taste a hint of the sweetness from the tangerines. It might sound odd to experience more than 2 flavours at a time but, I felt that all the flavours complimented and worked with each other nicely.   Wasabi Tuna: Maybe my expectation was a bit too high for this burrito after having a bomb experience with my Classic Salmon. I felt this burrito fell kind of flat in flavour however, it'd be perfect for those who enjoy a light and fresh experience. It may look heavy however, with all the vegetables (lettuce, red bell peppers, avocado, seaweed salad, etc), it gave it a very easy, light and fresh taste. I expected to taste a wave of wasabi (hence its name) over my taste buds but that wasn't the waste. It was very very mild and if you do want to get a kick more from the wasabi, you can always use the packet of wasabi provided. Just a warning though, this little packet of wasabi is quite potent. A pea-size of this thing will be enough to give you sniffles... well at least for me...  Overall, I enjoyed my first sushi burrito and I'm excited to come back and try their poke bowls. One thing that bothered me was the seaweed. It's quite tough and on the chewy side; it really takes a strong bite to sever it from the overall burrito. Also, burrito is a messy food... (unless you have a big mouth..) my toppings fell everywhere so, do expect mess!  Atmosphere was comfortable and service was very friendly."}
{"text":"I regret coming to Rolltation only once during my stay in Toronto!   When my friend and I came across this, we were so psyched for it! There was a line that goes out of the door, but it probably took us about 5-10 minutes to order and about another 3 minutes to get our food. You basically walk straight to the line, order, make a U-turn to see the production of your order, pay, and to gather whatever utensils you need. I ordered the salmon bowl and it was sooooooo good. There was plenty of salmon and enough portions of everything in the bowl.  A con is that there isn't enough seating available. But I would definitely come back again if I have the chance to!"}
{"text":"So fresh and delicious! My go to poke spot in the city! Generous portions, clean and great selection of accouterments!"}
{"text":"I'm usually particular about my food and don't appreciate people messing up my order. When I specified unagi sauce and teriyaki sauce, I somehow ended up with mayonnaise covered items in my bowl. Also stuff turns nasty when you have a strict diet restraint. I was hugely disappointed l considering the staff didn't follow clear instructions and by then was too late to go back as it was an Ritual order."}
{"text":"After my poor experience with the Carlton location, i decided to give Rolltation another try after this new yonge/bloor location had just opened. I had been coming here for a while, mostly because I work close and is convenient. For the most part, experience had been good. However, during my most recent visit where I had my usual bowl, I noticed that their salmon was not fresh - it had a sour gone-bad taste in my mouth (Yuck!). For this price $12.99 I would expect the ingredients to be fresh, especially if you are eating raw fish. I will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"**4.5 stars  I call it a super-sized handheld sushi-burrito SALAD.  Customizable rolls in either a bowl or a burrito. With the bowl, you have an option of brown rice, but of course, I was here for the roll. Open at 11AM, there's already lines forming at 11:30AM, but the wait is not too long (...if you are the fourth person in line).  Ask for a roll and a sheet is laid into a machine, then out it comes out with a perfectly distributed layer of rice. Impressive.  A true quick-serve style, as they go along a line to jam pack your roll with the goodies your want. I made an order up of two, and they were both very similiar in ingredients, but a drastic difference in taste:  Salmon | Green Lettuce | Red Onion | Avocado | Seaweed Salad | Tamago | Lotus Chip Sauce: Wasabi Mayo  Salmon | Green Lettuce | Cucumber | Avocado | Kani Salad | Tamago | Lotus Chip Sauce: Wasabi Mayo  Very surprisingly, the red onion one was a pleasure (the first). The sweet texture of the seaweed, combined with the soft avocado + salmon and crunch of red onion was glorious. The lettuce, I could definitely do without. But, I'm talking generosity as each topping was measured to give you your true money's worth. With each roll the fellas were wrapping up, it was a wonder that they finally got it all in without breaking it!  My favourite part of these customizable rolls were the \"crunch\" options. I got fried lotus root and they were phenomenal.  The rolls were $14.99 each, but honestly, it's much better to share and try a side as well. After half and literally one bite, I felt way too full. I thought the price was great for the serving and overload of fresh ingredients. Welcome to Dundas West!  TL;DR: If you're going in, def. try my combination listed great texture and flavour which compliment eachother well - really serves up what rolltation is all about. All that's off for me is the price point... But that can totally be justified by the fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Meh. I did not choose the burrito because burritos get messy. So they call their bowl poke and it is not poke to me when the fish isn't marinated. I could get past that if the global thing was still tasty but it wasn't. It was not bad, the fish was ok and they are generous with it so that is a good point. They're are a lot of ingredients in generous quantity but it's not extraordinary. It is basically a glorified salad. And at 13.99 + tax it is overpriced. Also the lack of seats and the cramped space isn't helping.  I'd rather have poke from a place where they actually marinate their fish and have better combination of ingredients."}
{"text":"YUM YUM!  I work right near this place and if you go at noon you're stuck in a line lol I went earlier around 11:40 am and got a nice fresh bowl of their Classic Salmon Poke Bowl.  The ingredients were very fresh and the bowl was PACKED.  I had a hard time finishing the entire thing..but I did.  I really liked corn and tangerine in this bowl to give it a sweetness, which paired nicely with the fresh salmon and spicy sauces!   Next up will be the tuna poke bowl and possibly a burrito but they look incredibly filling!!"}
{"text":"I came here when it first opened. The rice was nice and properly seasoned, the fish and ingredients tasted really fresh and delicious. Definitely recommend trying the lotus chip. For the price though, you could go to some sub-par AYCE sushi place but if you want something quick to order and quick to go, try this place out!"}
{"text":"Yay! Something delicious AND healthy! I got the wasabi tuna poke bowl. There was so much! I couldnt finish the whole bowl. My brain says to share it but my tummy says \"No way!\"   Will happily drop $15 bucks on this. So worth it!"}
{"text":"My first thought was that this couldn't be that amazing. It's basically an oversized sushi roll, right? Wrong.  Yes, these burritos are massive and about the size of my face. But it's not always about quantity. They have some wicked, fresh ingredients to back it up. Their signature burritos are some of their most popular ones, but you can also create your own. I'd recommending trying one of the signatures and then picking out the ingredients that you think you'd like to create your own because there's so many to choose from and might help you narrow them down. If you don't know what the toppings are, then ask them! My favourite is the Teri-shrimp from their signatures. I like the following toppings: purple potato, asparagus, tomago (egg), tobiko (fish roe), tempura bits (for the perfect bit of crunch), sweet corn and tangerine for an interesting mix of textures. They also offer up poke bowls if you want to skip the seaweed wrap.   Their customer service is amazing. They're helpful and answered all my questions. They also readily provide coupons and asked if i was student to offer me a discount. They have a stamp card that gives you a free burrito or bowl on your 10th one. Not to mention the speed of service is so quick! They'll have you out faster than you can say \"wasabi!\" They don't have very much seating so it's better to get take out."}
{"text":"Try to avoid during lunch hour and came around 11ish and barely anyone there.  Ordered the salmon burritos and the portion is large enough for sharing."}
{"text":"Placed an order of Teri Shrimp Burrito during lunch using Ritual. The roll consist of Shrimp, Kani Salad, Carrot, Edamame, Cabbage, Cucumber, Sweet Corn, Tempura Bits and Teriyaki Mayo. Theoretically, this should have been a delicious lunch. In reality, unfortunately, the shrimp and tempura bits was extremely oily. As well, the roll was sitting on the counter when I picked it up. The dressing was dripping through the paper wrapper. The roll was soaked through. It was not appetizing.   Overall, I am not sure who fell short, Rolltation or Ritual. It was just not enjoyable. I would not recommend that combination!"}
{"text":"Friendly Environment! Wide variety of side toppings to choose from!   Their most popular would be the classic salmon. Cheddar chicken wasn't as great, couldn't taste much of the cheddar. Teri shrimp is a good option if you don't feel like eating raw fish. :)"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times with my 10 year old daughter who has it in her mind that this place is awesome and she may be right about the food, but very inconsistent service and the discount card they give you is such BS. I pay close to $50 every time I go and they have a punch card for 10% discount but not on your total order but just the least expensive burrito so usually works out to $1. I don't like misleading promotions like these and have decided to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I customized my own sushi burrito and it was really fun. The lovely staff were extremely friendly and patient as I mulled over what I wanted haha. My creation tasted delicious so I definitely want to come back for more!"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  You can start off their specialty rolls that they have on the menu first before you try making your own. Maybe you'll like it? I had the classic salmon burrito.   What I liked most of the burrito is the fact that they added kale in their burrito. And every bite was a bite into a chunk of salmon. The burritos were a good size though! One burrito can easily be shared with two people so you can save some money there too!   I liked how they make it right on the spot in front of you. The service is fast too. The wasabi is in packets though so it's not fresh wasabi but the good thing is you can have as much as you want.   They don't have a big dining area though. Only a bar table at the front and four bar stools. So its customers are mainly take out customers.   LAST TIP?  Even though it says rolltation, it doesn't just specialize in burritos, they have poke bowls too. And of course, the ability to customize your own burrito as well :)"}
{"text":"I am a big advocate of sushi and burritos so naturally I had to try this place! It is a great take out spot. Ingredients were all fresh. I like that you can make your own or they have some great presets. I tried the salmon and really enjoyed it. The only downside is it is one large roll rather then getting a combination of sushi at a typical sushi joint. So if you want a combination of different rolls on your plate then this wouldn't be the place."}
{"text":"There's a nice selection of sushi burritos and other food here. Food is pretty good (I'm not convinced it's differentiated from other places) and service is nice too. Although find that it comes a little short on value for money considering the price ratio to how much food you would get. I'd definitely return. Just not in a rush."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience here! Order the classic salmon burrito if you are more conservative like me. Haha. It can't go wrong. The filling is very interesting that it contains kale, fish roe and purple temporal bites! yes, Purple!!! :)"}
{"text":"Props to Rolltation for actually being opened on a late Sunday evening, while most other Poke places were closed! I decided on a 'Build your own' Poke Salad and was pleased by their awesome add-on selection and the most potent wasabi mayo sauce I've had yet (note to self: use a 'Slim' amount of sauce next time).  The amount of salmon was mediocre but the options for sides are plentiful and large. Especially liked the lotus chips, purple potato, and tamago!"}
{"text":"Sushi Burritos: one of the biggest food hype's of 2016 has come to Toronto and I welcome it graciously. Rolltation is a newly opened sushi burrito place open on Dundas near Fugo. It is a tiny shop, but it is well decorated and has a hipster vibe. I really love the neon yellow sign as well.  Service: Lots and lots of workers squished behind the counter all with a job to do. They were all very efficient and was very quick and nice.  Food: I really really enjoyed it. It was super fresh, tasty, and delicious and the portion size is quite large. Unfortunately, some of the best toppings such as avocado, seaweed, and pork floss are 50 cents to a dollar extra on top of the base price. The total cost of everything turned into almost $17, which is crrrrrazy for lunch!  I really enjoy Rolltation for what it is, but it's quite expensive and for me, only to \"treat yo'self\" and not something I can order every day. If you really want to try the sushi burrito hype, Rolltation is great choice for big portions, fresh ingredients, and delicious food. You'll pay for it though! :)"}
{"text":"Not ground-breaking but pretty good. Fresh ingredients and the line moves pretty quickly! Kind of pricey for what it is but I'd recommend giving it a try if you haven't already.   I shared the Wasabi Tuna and I think the other one is called Original Salmon? Both were good. My friend, who's a wasabi lightweight, was tearing up from the tuna. We both liked the salmon one better - more complex flavours and textures. Plus I'm not a fan of bell pepper and there's red pepper in the tuna one. I found the salmon to actually be spicier than the tuna, though.   There's very limited seating and choice of drinks so I'd recommend grabbing a roll to go and then marching over to the hot dog stand on university for a cheap drink and plenty of concrete seats nearby!"}
{"text":"Rolltation is one of my favorite sushi fusion restaurants. Not only are their salmon sushi burritos fresh and delicious, the staff are very friendly, and the ambiance and decorations are brightly filled with personality.   I tried the salmon and tuna burritos and was quite delighted to find lots of toppings and seaweed inside. Meanwhile, don't let that one wasabi pack deceive you, that little guy will give you an intense eye watering lesson if you're not careful! So try a little first before adding it to gauge your tolerance level. Personally, I do believe that if your eyes aren't watering, then you're not truly enjoying the experience. Lastly, the only downside to eating these burritos is that it tends to fall apart after midway. So make sure you have napkins and maybe a fork as backup! Itadekimasu!"}
{"text":"Hit the spot! Got the classic salmon burrito after a workout. Super full so portions are generous. Fresh ingredients and service was great. Can also choose poke bowls and build your own burrito or bowl. Right at YONGE and eglinton so very convenient. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Last week, there was a person passing out flyers for Rolltation around Bloor and Yonge. The flyer entitled the recipient to 1 free signature burrito/poke/salad for free. Decided to stop by for lunch with a coworker today. Surrounded by wood and metal pipe décor, it gave off this retro vibe. There were several tables and seats on one side of the store. Upon stepping into the shop, there was a very enthusiastic greeting. The employees behind the counter were very welcoming, they asked if this was the first visit and guided the patrons to the correct spot. They handed a copy of their menu which was quite easy to navigate through.  The order is made at the back of the store, the food is assembled through the counter and makes it's way back to the cashier which is at the front of the shop. Tried a sushi burrito for the very first time and it was quite overwhelming. It was a gigantic sushi roll, filled with various toppings. The Classic Salmon had creamy avocado, sweet corn, juicy tangerine, wasabi tobiko, lots of kale and more. It sounds like an interesting combination but everything worked well together. It was sweet and savory but still had a bit of kick. Afraid the sriracha mayo would be too spicy, substituted with the unagi sauce which they were more than delighted to. One sushi burrito was pretty filling and at that price, wouldn't have expected anything less. The burrito was a little messy to eat, as it starting falling apart near the end also the seaweed became kind of soggy and started to lose its shape. Next time, might try a poke instead, maybe.  Overall, had a very positive and pleasant experience. If there was ever a craving for a sushi burrito or poke, this will be the place to visit but it would be a splurge and considered a treat."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and tasty but they only have 1 size option which is unfortunate. I got a bowl and it had too much rice and not enough toppings. The amount of toppings in it was about the same as the \"Small\" option at other poke spots but was priced like a Large. There are better places nearby."}
{"text":"I wouldn't come here for the poke again to be honest. For the price, I expected more flavor and salmon but it was the complete opposite."}
