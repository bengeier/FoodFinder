{"text":"I've been here quite a few times now and I was just thinkin \"hey, i should yelp this shit. It's real good\" So that's what I did. The chicken and beef sub is gooooood."}
{"text":"Best spicy beef sate pho I've had yet! The broth was perfect - very flavourful with a kick, but not too hot. It went especially well with a refreshing mango bubble tea and a few crispy little spring rolls. We had take-out, which was prepared well, so it made for amazing comfort food at home."}
{"text":"Sweet family run business.  I'm a pho buff and this place is midrange.  It's more of a take away set up.

Food comes quick
Sweet family run business
Taste of food is generally good


Cons
Sauce portions hoison hot sauce are small
The pho had a smaller than average noodle to broth ratio
Most spring rolls are microwaved"}
{"text":"I've been eating copious amounts of take-out from this cute little place quite a bit over the last month or so. That being said, I can attest to the absolute deliciousness of the food. They have bubble teas, creamy avocado shakes and good spring rolls! If you live or work in Marda Loop, you MUST try this exceptional little vietnamese place. Try the k-thi viet special combo! 

Fresh tasting food & generous portions at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"My husband and I are VERY frequent visitors of K-Thi, but the subs here are so good! Not quite as cheap as some places but for the flavor they deliver, worth! 

As are their Vietnamese spring rolls (which granted, is my all time favorite no you cannot have one of my spring rolls this is an addiction food) that I order every time I'm here. 

Bubble tea, a little bit $$, but I love the fresh fruit flavors they have. Taro all the way!

It is also nice when the ladies there remember who you are and what you usually order! Hard to find sometimes, but it just adds that little bit of something when you go somewhere to eat."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Vietnamese in the downtown area! I ordered from Skip the Dishes a few times now and it's the only one that hasn't disappointed me. The meat is juicy and flavorful, the vegetables fresh and plentiful. I am so so impressed and relieved that they seem to stay consistent in quality and taste."}
{"text":"I noticed my review from 2015 is not recommend nor was I informed that it would not be recommend. When I visited the site it appears that it is recommended although I had to look closer to see that it wasn't. This restaurant deserves my 5 star rating. I eat here regularly and am a big fan of the Vietnamese cuisine in Calgary.They are hard working, friendly, well priced and deserve this review. Be fair and leave the review Yelp"}
{"text":"I think this place has best Vietnamese sub so far.

Been here many times and it hasn't failed me yet."}
{"text":"I found this neighborhood gem while running errands in Marda Loop one summery day. 

We had the rare beef pho and sate chicken sub. The prices aren't terribly expensive ($9.50 for pho) but compared to the excessive prices for crappy quality food at fast food restaurants (OPA and Subway are on the same block), this is a much better deal. In the summer you can eat your meal on their tiny but adorably cute patio!! 

I won't deliberately go out of my way to eat here, but it is the best quick and delicious option among the many restaurants available in the area."}
{"text":"Living close to this little gem I come here at least once every couple weeks. Everything is super fresh and flavorful. The veggie sate soup with tofu is delicious. The tofu is seasoned and sliced thinly with a hint of nutmeg. The ladies who run the joint are super friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another chance and they did an even worse job. Two people who ordered after me got their orders before I did and when I asked how much longer my order would take they were rude about it. White customers get preferential treatment here, it's so disgusting to see but I witnessed it with my own eyes. There are many other choices in this area, not worth the visit"}
{"text":"Okay, this place is pretty great - by Calgary standards. Even by Toronto or Vancouver standards it's pretty good - though if placed there, instead of being one of the best-rated places in town, it would just be the best in that particular Asian food court.

Still, pretty expensive for a take-out hole in the wall. And nothing outside of the usual on the menu. Credit where credit is due though - they do what they do very well."}
