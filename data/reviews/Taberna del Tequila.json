{"text":"My fianc√© ate here right before getting on a plane to come back home in Atlanta. He loves Mexican so when he saw this on his terminal this was his first choice of course. Getting home from a 4 hour flight he laid down and started shivering and running a fever shortly after 1 hour has past his shivers got worst. Out comes this Mexican food. This place most definitely made him sick. Stay away... Stay away... Do Not Eat Here"}
{"text":"I had the carne asada salad at 5pm on Monday, Jan 1, 2018 and got extremely terrible food poisoning. By 1am Tuesday eastern time, I was glued to my toilet. I couldn't leave my bedroom for 14 hours. Up for 4 just around the house. The next day I slept for another 14 hours. Still felt weak and nauseated the second day. And I'm a generally healthy 32 year old female."}
{"text":"Nachos,not bad. I was advised not to order the chicken. So pork it was. Beer is cold and glass is clean. Shot of Jameson to round out the meal. Overall good indeed."}
{"text":"Had to get a bite before my flight and my choices were the taco bar here or Burger King and Pizza Hut. I figured I could get a decent taco in Phoenix, and even then I wasn't expecting much. Turns out I should have went with the fast-food chains. The tacos here were terrible, both steak and chicken had no flavor at all, and the tortilla was like a piece of cardboard. I know this is airport food, but come on people make an effort.
Couldn't even finish them."}
{"text":"Had an hour to kill before boarding, and this was the closest to our gate. Sat down for a drink and tried to order and appetizer (chips with queso) but they were out of it. So we settled for the chips with green salsa, yet it came out with two tiny plastic containers (like the kind you get from a taco shop you only go to after 2am) of salsa, one red and one green. Chips were cold and stale...and they cost $4.99. There was one waitress for the entire restaurant. Granted, it was 10pm, however, it was so packed we got the last table! She was definitely rushed but not her fault. We didn't try any other food, so not sure how it is! I would recommend trying another restaurant in the terminal!"}
{"text":"Pretty horrible. Service was fine but food was terrible. Food on the plane would have been better - cold tacos, stale chips.  The flavor was also not that great. Minimal food options."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a quick bite at the airport. Ask your server about drink specials. \"Would you like to add a shot to your beer for $4?\"... Why yes I would."}
{"text":"I'm giving four stars, but this is relative to other airport bars. The servers are always nice here and the margaritas are intoxicating. The nachos are edible. It's an airport. What do you want?"}
{"text":"Poor quality of food and pricy. Service too fast, 2 minutes ready from time of order...
Borito bacon was about $10, the tortia and bacon were  mushi, as if they were coocked and later warmed in microwave, the portion of potato is stingy. HENCE, why service of food was fast. Club soda is $3.00. 14.30 all togather $1.50 tip..  I've eaten it since I needed to take a flight and move soon. It was the worse borito breakfast I ever had! The waitress said she is sorry.  I was sorry too!"}
{"text":"First off I want to say that my waitress was outstanding, it was very busy on Monday 4/28/2014 at the Delta terminal and she was very successful at making sure everyone was taken care off.
What I am not happy with is the food. VERY disappointing. I ordered the 2 tacos plate with Chicken Lime as my meat choice. It was like eating cardboard. I literally had to take a sip of my lemonade after every bite just to swallow. The chicken tasted like it was just boiled, with no flavors, just water. The rice and beans had zero flavor as well. Does your company send out secret shoppers to taste the food that is being served? I don't know how anyone could like such bland food. I only ate one taco and the tortillas from the second one. I couldn't choke down anymore dry chicken, rice or beans. I did not send my food back because, I have seen Waiting, and I would rather just eat what I could then get food that has been messed with. Not saying your employees would do that but you never know. I really hope you get some one out there to taste the chunks of paper that is being served as chicken."}
{"text":"It's really not that great of a place - but once you're past security in this terminal, there really aren't any other choices.  If you come anytime during airport \"rush hour\", you'll be hard-pressed to find a place to sit, and your service will be slow as there's usually only one waiter/waitress working the floor.

The drinks are just fine, and the margaritas are above average (cost way above average), but the food sucks.  I've had their burrito, tacos, and their mexican pizza before.  Not great.  

I'd recommend hitting the Wendy's across the walkway first, then bring it into TdT and order a beer."}
{"text":"First, I want to say our server, Matthew was great.

BUT this place needs to step it up. I left my house at 4am this morning, so you can imagine there was no time to eat breakfast. I'm allergic to eggs and am vegetarian. When we finally got thorough security out only option was to eat at this place because Wendy's was put if the question. To my surprise, this place couldn't even make a simple quesadilla for me... And all of their breakfast items contained eggs! I ended up ordering a side of potatoes which is just pathetic.

You really should be more vegetarian friendly and accommodate people with food allergies. I'm really disappointed. I left AZ hungry and have another 6 hours before my flight ends. No cool."}
{"text":"Food was not that great. Had tortilla soup that was not warm. Ordered coffee...didn't realize it was $3 for a cup. Ridiculous. Should have gone to Wendy's across the way."}
{"text":"Taberna del Tequila was one of the only few places I was able to get food inside the security at Sky Harbor Airport.  They have a restaurant and take-out.  

I tried to order one of their breakfast and it was already over before 11am.  The cashier told me it is till 10:30am.  What a bummer.  

I ordered their quesadilla with beef and it was below mediocre.  I mean it is very hard to mess up quesadilla to begin with and I could have made it better than they did.  It came with very little lettuce and mediocre condiments.  

It was waaay over priced and so disappointing considering the fact Phoenix usually has great Mexican places.  

On the positive note, the staffs were very nice."}
{"text":"Not good at all. This gringo could make a better burrito at home. And, $3.99 for a bottle of water!? Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else. And for passers thru, wanting a taste of Mexican food in the southwest, this place isn't it. $15 for a breakfast burrito and bottle of water.....at least the water was good."}
{"text":"No... Just no.
The restaurant looks nice, but the $11 huevos rancheros breakfast is a secretly disguised $4 breakfast..."}
{"text":"So, we are waiting for a flight at 8AM and having a breakfast burrito at Blue Burrito (connected to Taberna del Tequila at Sky Harbor Airport) and I was complaining to my boyfriend that they don't give out their really good hot sauce anymore - instead they give Tapatio (sucks).   The guy sitting next to us (Roger) works at Taberna del Tequila and he got up and went to the restaurant and brought us some!  Went out of his way to make sure we were good and it wasn't even something we bought at the restaurant!   Needless to say, over and above.  Thanks, Roger!"}
{"text":"My lunch of chimi came out cold. The bar tender was great and ordered it again. The he gave me a free drink.  I was there over an hot and my second lunch of chimi came out and it was colder than the first. The bar tender did not want to charge me for anything and did an amazing job.
I made him charge me for something so I could tip him as I did not have cash. 
This was by far the best bar tender, worst food experience of my life.

I hope the bar tender working on September 20th at 3 pm finds a new job. And I hope the delta terminal gets and new restaurant!

This place was a disgrace!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING

Too bad I cannot give this less than one star.  I remember a much better eating experience a year ago before a flight and now I wonder if they were using the same stock of food from a year ago!

Service was awful.  We didn't even get our sodas until about 15 minutes after ordering them.  I ordered the chips+salsa and the veggie tacos.  I think they dump the chips in the trash and serve the bag cut up to look like chips instead.  No flavor, no salt, stale - come on at least heat them up to fool me!  The salsa is 'charred tomato' and it was cold as ice with once again no flavor.  I take that back, it did taste like the inside of a can of tomatoes.

The server said the veggie tacos come with a side of rice and black beans.   What I did not realize was that the taco 'shells' themselves were silver dollar flat cold 'patties' that looked like someone took instant grits and formed pancakes.  The veggies appeared to be pulled out of someone else's order and it was apparent they dont clean their grill.  

Oh and lets not forget the scoop of mush they called rice.  Those black beans, well yes there were some - exactly 9.  Yes, nine whole black beans on TOP of my rice.  This left a huge empty space on my plate which was instead occupied by a small plastic container of more ice cold salsa.   I was begging for salt, pepper, dust, sand - anything to add some flavor to the meal that tasted like crushed ice made from dirty water.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!"}
{"text":"Despite not being Federal employees in any way, Memorial Day seems to be a time when restaurateurs think they deserve a day off, leaving me with few actual lunch options and relegating me to the worst of the worst: Eating. In an AIRPORT RESTAURANT.

Turns out that Taberna wasn't actually as bad as all that - the bar is nice to spend a few hours waiting for your flight, and the titular Blue Burrito - despite not being blue in any way, shape or form - wasn't too bad by fast food standards, and quite plentiful for the $8 I spent on it. And if you don't like it, you can cover it with Cholula, close your eyes, and pretend you're eating somewhere better."}
{"text":"Wow, it seems like Taco Bell in Arizona has a full beer, wine, and liquor license!"}
{"text":"Saw nasty reviews, but had to eat before a long flight and figured I would find out for myself. I think 2.5 stars would be ideal, because there isn't anything special here besides the fact that it has no competition other than Starbucks.

Sat down, was greeted cooly by the bartender (David) and I asked for a menu. Had him recommend a beer and a meal. He chose carnitas tacos and named some beers. Asked if I could get veggies or fruit instead of beans and rice, so he said he could get me chips and salsa.

Food was hot and seemed all in order, just nothing really delicious or unique. Bland and generic, so that's the 2.5 stars out of 5. The staff seem a little more concerned with hanging out than working, and you can't get breakfast for lunch (why?) after 10:30am I believe.

I suppose if you have prime real estate, you don't have to shine too brightly. I Would try to eat before security next time, but had no real issues with this place other than disappointment that a passionate company isn't setting up shop here in Terminal 3 :/"}
{"text":"Everything went great until this one waitress( older blonde girl) 12:07 AM January 11- started her closing duties with the bar.  She was very inconsiderate. I had a $22 glass of wine that I was not finished with and I left it because I couldn't believe the lack of professionalism and courtesy she was showing. I eyed the male bartender who was super sweet the whole time but he didn't catch on. They were still open for the last flight back to ATL that departed at 12:45 and I had already paid and left a 30% tip. She was pulling chairs out loudly right next to me and started sweeping right under my feet. Treat your patrons better until you are fully closed and don't have one person left in that restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome service from Jen. On this busy holiday travel day she was cheerful, friendly, and quick with drink and menu suggestions. Food was great, wine cold, everything came promptly. The other server and the bartender also seemed  upbeat and friendly. Great experience today."}
{"text":"Congrats you are trapped at the only bar sit/down restaurant at the Delta terminal. With that being said, you can expect the usual experience when no competition is involved - incredibly lousy food at high prices. The Barbacoa is a basically a Mexican sloppy joe...and no, the wheat bread it's served between isn't even toasted. The cocktails are weak and precisely measured to ensure no buzz for under $25. Service is actually pretty decent. 

Stick with the chips and guacamole, craft beer and maybe a churro. I hate fast food, but Wendy's across the way would be a better choice if you don't need a drink."}
{"text":"Don't eat here! Tried to have breakfast, very limited menu, food served almost tepid, waitress friendly but sort of dingy and place not well staffed.  Not many choices in Terminal 3.  I cannot believe Steve Wynn is associated with this place!"}
{"text":"If you're into food poisoning and piss poor service, this restaurant is for you. The manager told me himself that everyone complains about the food but he doesn't care because they're at an airport. If negative one star was available, that's the rating I'd give."}
{"text":"Waited 40 minutes for a $22 glass of wine.  By the time it came, the plane was boarding. Unfortunately, the one great server in the place was not ours but tried to help - manager and our server were not only incompetent and EXTREMELY rude, but ultimately accused us of not leaving enough money.  We gave the tip to our \"non server\" who tried to help us. Enter at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Definitely a two for the value you are getting.  Of course the prices get jacked up since you are in an airport. With a long flight ahead of me, I had no choice.  I ordered the steak and eggs with a sprite for $20 with tip.  They at least bring you food quick, but these were some of the sorriest steak and eggs ever.  Scrambled over cooked eggs with stir fried beef, no way I would have eaten this if I was back home.  The waiter was kind of clueless and forgot my side of salsa."}
{"text":"Disgusting!! I ordered the chimichurri burger. It tasted like boiled meat. Seriously, it tasted exactly like the burgers we were forced to eat at grade school lunch cafeterias. It was that bad. Threw it away! Total waste of $12. Run away if you want edible food!!!"}
{"text":"If you find yourself on a frontier or delta flight, AND you'd really like an overpriced ticket to intestinal distress HAVE I GOT THE SPOT FOR YOU!

My shrimp salad gets a two word review - \"Sh*t Salad\"

Horrifyingly bad food, syrupy sweet margaritas, and \"What did I do in my previous life to deserve this\" service.  

One extra star because it's the only booze game on this side of the airport."}
{"text":"I'm 6ft tall...so I know they saw me!
Waited for 30 min, before leaving because of slow service.  Thee items to chose from, and pretty snooty staff.

Don't bother...get a burrito from next door!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service, the food might be at the airport, but the food is fabulous, and the atmosphere for a traveler is quite welcoming."}
{"text":"I don't understand how the customer should feel as though I did something wrong by asking to be seated?  Why am I wrong to ask for food ALONG with a beverage.  For 5 years I have come into this place because it's the only option in this area.  And it's ALWAYS the same!!! Ownership please mystery shop this place so you can empathize with US THE CUSTOMER.  How hard are smiles and yes's?????"}
{"text":"I just missed breakfast but I wasn't overly disappointed. 

I was disappointed, however, when my burrito arrived feigning lukewarmness. 

The waiter was very friendly without being annoying. The decor was nice and there are a few spots with electric for your laptop. 

The food is nothing to crave but it's edible and in an interesting locale. It works.. but just barely."}
{"text":"Tasty breakfast, but place looked a little dirty. Not sure if it was because it was busy or thats just the away it is. Yes food was good. Waitress was very nice. Just need to clean the place a bit."}
{"text":"Gross, unsanitary and rude staff. I returned my order. First strike was that no one was focused on the cashier stand/customer. The gentleman who finally came to ring us up had his hands in tortilla chips and then handled money - yuck. The place was dirty and the floor grungy (see photo). Next strike, when my order came - a bean and cheese burrito for $8.60- it had no toppings, as I watched them make it, and when I asked for salsa they said \"we don't got none\" and tried to send me on my way. I asked for a refund the manager was found and said \"we have salsa now\". No thanks, your dirty restaurant made me lose my appetite."}
{"text":"Zero stars.   Manager was an awful, miserable human being.  People at the bar asked if the audio to President Obama's speech could Be turned on.   She said no because apparently, the most significant presidential speech since 9/11 was \"too political\".    A few minutes later, one of te waitresses asked her to change one of the other TV's to cnn somewhere else in the restaurant because a customer requested to.  She barked back at the waitress \"no, it's on enough TVs.  Tell them to move\".  
What kind of customer service is it to tell someone to pick up their entire meal and luggage to move?   

I am soo glad this happened before I ordered my food."}
{"text":"Food was bland and terrible. I give it 2 stars only because service was good and attentive.  I get it, it's airport food, but they are so bad even the worst airline wouldn't serve it on a plane.  I had the tequilla lime chicken tacos.  The chicken tasted like it came out of a can.  No hint of taquilla or lime. As a matter of fact, they couldn't be bothered with salt or pepper either, it was literally straight out of a can. The salsa was store bought so at least that has some flavor. The black beans and rice that came with the tacos were pretty bad too. The black beans were just heated up from a can, rice tasted like it was from a lipton packet. Really not worth your time or calories."}
{"text":"This is airport food so I did not have very high expectations. It is OK and the beer was cold but the food is definitely mediocre. Service was friendly and efficient so no quibble there. 
I ordered the  blue corn quesadillas and a Fat Tire beer. Let me just say the fact they had Fat Tire on tap helped boost the star up to a 2. The blue corn tortillas were nice and warm but rubbery. The chicken, while slightly flavorful, was dried out. The cheese and vegetables were very skimpy. The guacamole and sour cream served on the side were a necessary addition to help the palatableness of the dish. 

The service was pleasant and attentive so that also helped pull it off the dreaded one star rating. 

The food is pricy for the quality - $20. Again this was not unexpected as it is an airport food place and they do have a captive audience. 

It is an OK alternative to the usual fast food and it is a sit down waiter serves you type of place. Always welcome while in limbo."}
{"text":"I tried the express side of this restaurant and as in other reviews, it's one of the only places that you can really have food to eat if you don't want fast food. I ordered the roasted pork tacos, the American way, without lettuce. You get a very healthy portion of the meat and an OK serving of the cheese/sour cream. Over all it was tasty and filling.  The order did come with rice and beans but the rice I could tell was scraped pretty much from the bottom of the pot (we call it pegao and I really don't like the pegao so I didn't eat it.) I didn't like that it was expensive - 3 tacos and a bottled water came out to $13!"}
{"text":"Grab a fruit parfait at one of the satellite food places or something and spare yourself. 

Sure, airport food is usually not super-great and my expectations were adjusted accordingly...but I HAVE had good quesadillas at airport spots before. Heck, a Chili's does a better job than this place. The quesadilla was greasy even for a quesadilla. I had instant food regret as my stomach attempted to run away from its impending doom. 

You get about 6 chips with your order and absolutely nothing hints at freshness--the pico de gallo is in its own neat little container that it's been living in for quite some time. Dang, man, would some lettuce or a freshly chopped tomato kill you? 

The service was really good though; our waiter was friendly and prompt and awesome. The food was not his fault."}
{"text":"mushroom tacos were delicious! staff was VERY attentive and nice. margaritas weren't strong enough, just too sweet."}
{"text":"Breakfast was surprisingly good! Salsa had fresh cilantro and lime. Wait staff were friendly and responsive. All good."}
{"text":"This place is a mix between sit down dining and fast food.  There are servers but plastic utensils and plates.  Super casual and really great food.  The barbacoa sandwich is amazing bit don't order it if you are with someone you want to impress because it is messy to eat.  Great margaritas... A good stop for a semi quick bite."}
{"text":"Terrible place to eat, food came out cold so I sent it back and canceled my order.  When the waitress came back she brought my tab for the club soda I drank while waiting for the food and walked away without saying a word.  Bad food, poor service and poor managment, go to burger king, at least your expectations will be met."}
{"text":"DONT ORDER an Ice Tea, they charge you almost $5.00.  And they don't give you a choice, that's it!!!  And they are very rude about it!!!! Paula, my server, was very short and didn't give me the option to order something else.

Do you think everyone wants to pay $5 for ICE TEA?  Come on..."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE. The staff is extremely rude. Good thing I had two hours to kill before my flight because service was also slow. I had the chips and guacamole which was ok. I also had the barbacoa tacos which were WAY overpriced and very disappointing. Advice would be to skip this place!"}
{"text":"This place is sooooooooo WACK! Do yourself a favor and go to Wendy's. I ordered a salad and they \"ran out\" of lettuce. Ummm ma'am it's lunch time lets just be honest you didn't order the romaine for the week. 

Ended up with fish tacos (insert sad face emoji).  They we're horrible. The restaurant didn't event provide real utensils, we were provided plastic and we dined in. Do yourself a favor and go pass Taberna and go right to Wendy's you've been warned. 

Oh and our waiter asked my coworker if she could go ahead a pay for her meal because it's time for her to get off. I mean really!!! Right in the middle of her meal. No ma'am Pam you gone wait today."}
{"text":"You made me take a taco OUT OF MY BODY. 
THAT IS THE OPPOSITE WAY A TACO IS SUPPOSED TO GO! 

FILTHY. Inedible food. Awful service. 

You wand food poisoning? Cause that's how you get food poisoning. 


The bar is already ridiculously low for an airport taco... But these people can't even make something you can quickly choke down before boarding. 

The barbacoa tacos they gave me (after messing up my order TWICE) were cold in the middle. 

They can't even manage to properly microwave taco meat. 

YOU MADE ME SPIT OUT A TACO. DO YOU KNOW HOW RARE THAT IS FOR ME? Inexcusably awful food. 

HOLY Hell does this ever epitomize awful airport food."}
{"text":"A note on context: I arrived into terminal 3 at 10pm hungry and looking at a 12:50am flight to the east coast, so I was none too picky.

That said, the service was fast even as the staff was clearly closing down for the night (seems like it closes right around 10pm with some slight leeway). There was only a limited menu available, so I had the shredded chicken burrito, which came with nachos, and two large Sam Adams. The burrito was fine, neither wonderful nor terrible, and the chips were fine though sans salsa, which was a bummer. The draft beer was middle of the line, no complaints.

My bill was $21, each item being about $7 each, which isn't bad at all for a sit-down airport restauarant. If you enjoy lounging before a flight, this restaurant is cheaper than an airport Chili's and has mutliple TVs with different sports channels on, so not bad for the traveler on the go in Phoenix."}
{"text":"First off, I'm surprised (and a bit disappointed!) that I'm not the first to review this place. I was sure no one would have taken the time to review this restaurant/bar inside Terminal 4 of the Phoenix airport!

Well, that being said, it's certainly not worth more than 3 minutes of my time, so I'm going to force myself to keep this short (in fact, I've got the timer going as we speak!). 

The decor inside this place is surprisingly attractive for an airport restaurant and I especially liked all of the mosaic and tile work. The server was efficient and friendly and took our order quickly. The Bloody Mary we had wasn't anything spectacular but was definitely spicy enough and mixed well. The \"Mexican Pizza\" we ordered (in large part because the server said it was \"really amazing\") was not actually amazing--however, it was a really large portion for the $7 or so we paid and would be a great thing to split if you're looking to have a quick, cheap meal in the airport that's a notch above the fast food options. 

If I owned this place, though, I'd definitely change the slogan, which says something about \"inventive\" Mexican food. From a look at the menu and the dish we tried, the food is pretty standard. They'd be better off marketing themselves as a nicer sit-down alternative to the other choices in Terminal 4. 

Done!"}
{"text":"This waiter was rude and didnt even care about our service. was off on his cell phone most of the time... I guess this is what you get for pretty much the only restaurant in the airport.
The Banana Margarita was actually really good."}
{"text":"I hit this place up in hour 2 of my 5 hour wait for my flight and ordered the quesadilla.  Came with nacho chips, salsa, guac, and sour cream.  

Everything was GOOD.  My final bill was under 10 bucks (I didn't get a beer or anything) and I left very satisfied.

Perhaps my favorite part of the establishment was the staff.  The bartender was very nice and outgoing.  We talked sports and stuff.  He's probably used to making small talk with all sorts of weary travelers.  Anyways, it was appreciated."}
{"text":"A good place to kill time at the bar watching sports. If your hungry they serve select items from the Blue Burrito menu. Not bad but not the best. What do you expect in an airport though? Service has always been prompt and they dish out a good spicy bloody marie at your request.

Airport pricing of course..."}
{"text":"Interesting reviews.  Let's remember that this is Mexican food - in an airport.  It's not even a real airport, it's Sky Harbor in Phoenix, so it is basically a small step over white collar prison.  

1.  LOCATION.  It is one of the two A terminals (again, it's PHX) between gates 20 and 22.

2.  FOOD.  It serves Mexican food.  You can buy it from one side as take out, or you can sit on the other side, pay the same amount and have someone bring it to you AND be able to buy alcohol.  Option 2 seems like the easy choice.

3.  QUESADILLAS.  I got the blue corn quesadillas and they were pretty good.  It is hard to mess up such an easy meal, but it was good.  The guacamole was actually fresh.

4.  MARGARITA.  It was 10 AM.  I'd been traveling for 4 hours already, and it tasted pretty good.  The bar was low, but that's okay.

I liked it.  I'll go back."}
{"text":"I just spent 8 days in Florida.  I have had a total of 2 drinks in the past 8 days.  This kookie tequila bar in the middle of the C terminal in Phoenix is like my mirage in the dessert.  Only when I walked in, it did not disappear.  

I'm two double gin and tonics down, and I have plenty of time before my next flight.  Maybe it's the gin talking, but these are some damned fine nachos.  Damned.  Fine.  And the bartender?  Even finer...though he has me on an auto re-up system with these G&T's, so again, it could be the gin talking.

I would come back here in a heart beat the next time I'm in Phoenix.  Damned.  Fine."}
{"text":"I usually don't even bother reviewing airport food because it's not worth the time.

However, this place annoyed me so much that I just had to SAY SOMETHING to SPARE other weary travelers from this place.  Let's just get this out of the way: airport food is usually not that good.  OK, I agree, I'm with you.  Even when you take this into account, however, this place still fellates burro huevos.

FOOD:
\"Mexican: redefined\": this is their food slogan. I have no idea what this means, but I hate it.  I paid $10.XX for a burrito and six chips here and it was probably both one of the smallest AND crappiest burritos I have ever had (this is a very challenging feat to accomplish).  So for about twice the price of Chipotle (a burrito benchmark) I got something made with low-grade SYSCO ingredients that was about HALF the size (and, once again DOUBLE the price). Please note, this burrito (called the BLUE BURRITO, probably some weaksauce* tequila/agave reference) is affectionately referred to as their \"signature item\".

BEER:
Crappy airport selection Bud/Miller/Coors with FAT TIRE being the most flavorful option.  They were really proud of their Tequila.

SERVICE:
Was actually awesome, food came out fast, and I needed to JET in a hurry to make my flight.  My waitress was super nice and SUPER SNAPPY.  She even seemed a bit sad that I wasn't going to have time to eat the thing while sitting down (had to take half of this MASSIVE thing** on the plane with me, to the detriment of the other poor passengers).  The service was so good that it's the only reason I'm not one-starring this RE-DEFINED dining experience.

$$$:
A beer, a shot of well bourbon, and a burrito set me back $27.

*yeah, their salsa and hotsauce was also bland
**I'm surprised they didn't make me check it at the gate"}
{"text":"A friendly waitress with a smile gives it a second star.   It's hard to be real in a airport... But at least pretend to serve warm wood."}
{"text":"Lol, even with a 2 star average, this place is still absurdly packed...because it's a ****ing airport, so what's their incentive to try harder? If I worked there, maybe I'd even feel like being rude once in a while because I'm so stressed out from working non-stop on *****y pay at the \"friendliest airport in the country.\" *kek* Well, I hope I would still provide good service....

Honestly, I was scared to even walk in here. I was just gonna grab my Wendy's and sit at the gate. I mean, you've gotta dig deep and push hard to achieve a 2 star average Yelp rating on a large number of reviews. That's not something that happens by itself. 

But, someone else in my party insisted, went in, and ordered the chicken nachos or whatever. It was not that bad. Well okay, the chicken was like some dry, frozen chicken fajita chicken, the cheese was like some bull**** cheese sauce, but it was edible. The other ingredients were mostly fine. The chips weren't too stale. I didn't get food poisoning. And yeah, it was absurdly overpriced, but not entirely unprecedented for an airport. 

Got some kilt lifter on tap too, and as far as I could tell, there was nothing wrong with it

Our server was also nice enough and competent."}
