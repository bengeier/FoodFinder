{"text":"Food is fabulous! I shared the vegetable risotto and pasta with marinara and both were exceptional. Our server was also wonderful"}
{"text":"I've been to this neighborhood gem twice now and have enjoyed both experiences greatly -- with the exception of the server I had in my most recent visit.  Should you get Fabi, she is excellent!  Should you get Ken, ask for Fabi.  That way, besides the food and the ambiance, you will also enjoy your server.  The menu is replete with choices -- and as you are unable to taste everything your first go around, you will have to come back for more.  There are always specials in each of the three categories (appetizers, salads, entrees), so don't make any decisions until you've heard about these additional savory choices.  The desert choices aren't unusual, so do choose an appetizer and a salad to round out your evening's dining experience.  Lovely and delicious food.  So pleased that this spot finally has a restaurant that will stick!"}
{"text":"What a charming place. Impeccable, personal service. Honest delicious food. War and cozy. This place would fit in very nicely on the upper east side or around the corner from your hotel in Rome. It just makes you feel good."}
{"text":"I am Italian, meaning I grew up in Italy and came to the States a few years ago. Now, that doesn't necessarily make me an expert but I think I had enough meals, both home made and at restaurants, back in my country to be able to say Il bacio is the best Italian restaurant in town. And honestly I don't know what other people here are talking about (smelled like urine??? Small wine list??? Tiramisu should come as a square not in a cup????). I go there often and I have never smelled anything that was less that delicious, the wine list is one of the best in little Italy and there is no rule as to how a tiramisu should look like!! To all of you who want to try authentic Italian food in a friendly atmosphere go to I'll bacio."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for dinner the other week and had a wonderful night. We had driven into Little Italy with no idea where to go, and Il Bacio seemed like an obvious choice; unlike the cluttered mayfield restaurants all stacked together in one small strip, Il Bacio is removed from the congestion and allows an actual quiet and peaceful evening on their patio.  We ordered the figs and pig salad special to split, which had beautiful shaved prosciutto and a healthy amount of figs and bacon. Both of has had the Pinot Nero by the glass, which was a special for the evening and recommended by the waitress. The wine was perfectly light and refreshing for a summer evening. For an entree, I had the veal marsala, which as my waitress had herself said when taking my order, was a very solid choice. The veal was moist and cooked perfectly, and the sauce tasted full and delicious. My girlfriend is a vegetarian and had a generous serving of cheese ravioli, and by her rapidly finished plate and it's incredibly cheesy appearance, it must have been pretty good as well.   The owner himself came out during our meal to ask how our food was. He was personable and talked about how he's trying out new specials such as the fig salad for when he redoes the menu in August, and he even brought out a generous sample of gelato for my girlfriend to try (which by the way, was chocolate hazelnut and pretty darn good). It sounds like he has some pretty cool ideas and is making an effort to include diverse food options for vegetarians, vegans, and gluten-free eaters. It also sounds like he is excited to rework the wine list the old owners left behind, which currently is very standard. We are both looking forward to returning when he reopens."}
{"text":"This is a perfect place for a special occasion, whether for a date, seeing a show before/after or taking out clients. The ingredients are always fresh, with plenty of variety in the menu. You will always have impeccable service, and they will make a dish for you that isn't necessarily on the menu, if you ask. Owner Antonio and his staff are classy and fun. wonderful experience. [New restaurant, Nora, has replaced it, but you can still expect a wonderful meal with an updated look)."}
{"text":"Only reason I can't give this place a 5 is that it is fairly pricey. Nice, intimate atmosphere, decent portions, but truly some of the best food in the area."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Friday (5/5/15). Ordered the Bruschetta, Calamari Arrabiata for appetizers. The Bruschetta wasn't bad but the Calamari was tasteless. The sauce was watery and had no spices at all (e.g. garlic, pepper, etc). For the entree's we ordered the Veal Torellini in Bolognese and the Cioppino. Neither of them had any flavor. The tortellini was overcooked and was so watery you could tilt the dish and see it puddle. The Ciopinno broth was very watery and had no flavor beyond the seafood.  There is a new owner who bough it two weeks ago. I guess they will be changing the name and the menu. It was odd because the waiter pushed the Cioppino and kept saying the veal tortellini was a classic but it was his first day being there and had never tasted anything. But later on he said he was part owner. At least the wine was good.  Overall I wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"The staff is very solicitous and the food service very prompt.  Quantities are generous. Quality is good.  Selection somewhat limited.  Reserved parking in front of the restaurant makes parking in this difficult area super easy when the restaurant isn't busy.  They actually play very pleasant Italian music in the background, too; emphasis on background.  Big problem is value.  For the prices paid here you can get exceptional food in exceptional restaurants.  If you need quick service and turnaround this would be the place.  Otherwise, check out the values elsewhere."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Cute little place right down the street from Little Italy on Murray Hill."}
{"text":"We called Il Bacio on about 10 min notice when we & our 2 out of town guests were rained out @ Wade Oval Wednesday concert. They were able to accommodate us. Our guests absolutely loved the old world ambience. All 4 of our meals were outstanding-- 2 veal chops, 1 veal scaloppine & 1 steak. The owner offered to make any other dish to suit our tastes, with any ingredients shown on their menu? & allowed us to bring in the wine we had purchased for our picnic ( w/ a corkage fee, of course), Tiramisu for dessert was light & delicious. Live mandolin music added to the ambience. This place is an absolute gem -- ambience, food,  & service. Cannot wait to go back !"}
{"text":"The stars shine for all who come!  This was our first fine dining date...what a magical night! From the bubbly glass of champagne served when we arrived, to the amazingly tender bites of veal, and the just right al dente pasta, and we cannot forget how the tiramisu just melted in our mouths. And the perfect nightcap of Limoncello sips...have I mentioned that we fell in love there and were lucky enough to be married there! Yep, it was the perfect day, just our closest friends and family! Antonino and his crew were just the most gracious hosts, they made our day unforgetable!  Review by Drew & Debbie from Concord Twp"}
{"text":"Not my favorite restaurant in Little Italy, food tastiness wise (even though I didn't get any pasta dishes but a chicken dish).  I would definitely go back in the future to try some new dishes.  They also have gluten free options and if you call a couple days ahead, they will buy gluten free pasta for you, which is a plus!"}
{"text":"Love this Place!!!! My boyfriend and I love the quaint romantic atmosphere of the restaurant. My favorite dish is the Penne Al Pesto (best pesto in Little Italy). Also, I have had the duck before which was great. Always have had terrific service as well."}
{"text":"SOON TO BE RENAMED \"NORA'S\" PLACE.  Apparently Antonino moved back to Siciily and sold the business to a man who bought it for his son who apparently has worked in a bunch of resort restaurants (think ski resort etc). Having eaten here somewhere just south of 30 times, this place hands down used to have the best veal bolognese in the entire city and everything on this menu was consistent. Part of the charm of this dimly lit romantic hideaway from all things Mayfield Road was its obvious decor (yes there was actually a dolce and gabbana ad in the bathroom and the entranceway was adorned by ye olde Gustav Klimpt's The Kiss).   I went a few days back and it was honestly the worst dinner I've had in Cleveland or anywhere for that matter. I'm an avid cook of italian, french, and japanese cuisine and while i'm by no means a savant, I do truly consider myself a student of the culinary world and I like to think I do my best to give a good honest assessment.   The first course was a horrid \"calamari special\". Calamari special amounted to few lightly breaded tasteless squid pieces standing with their mouths agape next to a hilarious attempt at food art (someone was trying to be cute with what I assume was supposed to be an \"aoli wave\" that the calamari bits were surfing atop. This was not aoili, it tasted like sysco brand mayonaisse sprinkled with a few parsely sprigs (READ: the rot blackened root end of a carrot borne out of the unsold produce catacombs that lie beneath the sewer system of the West Side Market). It was simply put, disgusting.  My companion ordered Costate Di Agnello Al Rosmarino which is supposed to be lamb chops sauteed in olive oil white wine, lemon & rosemary. The lamb chops were served completely overcooked (well done and dry to the bone) with the same garbage \"aoli\" spread over the top. No olive oil, no white wine, no lemon, no rosemary (they used the same parsely sprigs). My other companion ordered the same dish and the plate was served with ZERO sauce, ZERO seasoning, no Sysco Brand Mayo. They basically took it out of the pan and slapped it on a plate. When we told the waiter he actually tried to make up an excuse instead of immediately grabbing the plate and apologizing.  When the manager asked me how dinner was I told him that this was our favorite restaurant for many years and everything was awful. He never offered to take anything off the bill. He smugly told me that they were going to be reopening soon. The new owners have ruined a special place for myself and countless others who knew better than to eat on Mayfield road or waste their money over at Washington Place. Do not eat here. Go to La Campagna in Westlake or Osteria di Valerio on St. Clair downtown cleveland (get the osso bucco). Shame on these people for disgracing the good name of Il Bacio."}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian in town! After reading some other reviews, I'd like to set the record straight! Yes, Antonio is from Sicily and knows good food! He buys all his ingredients fresh. If its not the best, you won't see it on the menu. But he's not the chef! Chef Greg is brilliant! Any of his seafood dishes with the champagne-grapefruit reduction are my recommendation. He also makes an arugula salad with a honey vinaigrette dressing--awesome! The tiramisu is the best I've had. It is an authentic Italian recipe. If your tiramisu comes in a slice, it's not authentic! The marscapone cheese is the secret, and it doesn't slice! Yes, it's a bit pricey. But it's not Olive Garden, ok?"}
{"text":"My wife's company had guests in from China and we were tasked with entertaining them for this particular Thursday evening. They requested Italian.  I have been to several restaurants on Murray Hill and always impressed... Until this visit.  The waiter was rude and sharp with us, when discussing menu options his only response was \"There are the specials I listed and a whole page of {insert food item here}\".  This was despite being the only table in the restaurant at the time.  Aside from the deplorable service, the food was ho hum.  I know more canned food items where used in my meal than I would have expected at half the price.  Next time I'm off to Murray Hill, this place is not an option."}
{"text":"I went on a double date with my best friend and his girlfriend here a couple nights ago and overall it was a pretty great experience. The location was nice and easily accessible with a decent amount of parking nearby, the restaurant itself was very cozy and quaint with acceptable lighting and decor. The waitress was a real pleasure, she was sociable and offered to remake my drink for me when she noticed I wasn't drinking it due a a very heavy amount of kahlua in my White Russian. The mussels and kalamari came in a delicious marinara sauce, seasoned very well and the veal chop was cooked to my exact specifications and came with a remarkable risotto. Service was prompt and overall it was a pretty good experience. The lemon cake was also as good as the tiramisu and I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys cake."}
{"text":"This truly is one of the best Italian restaurants in Ohio. I'm amazed when I read other reviews and they talk about the price. FIND SOME PLACE CHEAPER TO EAT!  I'm sure Bucca di Peppo  is your kind of place. As for the people that complain that they ordered one of the specials, NEVER ORDER A SPECIAL! They always sound better than they are. And if you order gnocchi, you should have gone to Sokilowski's. Talk about a bland entree. I've eaten at almost every restaurant in the North End of Boston and this is as good as any of them. Chicago is full of \"Italian \" places. Il Bacio is as good, if not better than all of them. Take the time to enjoy your meal, don't walk in with any expectations, and relax. Eating should be something savored, not rushed through."}
{"text":"Some very good food, but the prices are a bit high for the serving sizes. I had Veal Tortellini, and they were excellent, but I finished dinner and was still rather hungry. My friend had gnocchi, and was quite disappointed.  This is a cozy little place, and I can say that at least some of the food is delicious (the tortellini), but I've heard a lot of mixed reviews. If you've got some cash to use up and want to try it, I don't discourage it, but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here after visiting my sister at the nearby UH.  We stumbled upon this place a bit before they opened, but they warmly invited us in and told us that they would serve us.  It was so cozy and romantic inside.  The menu is limited, but everything on it sounded delicious and I had a difficult time deciding.  But the wine was good, my wife looked beautiful, and the meal was great.  We got out just in time, the place was getting mobbed with people grabbing a bite before going on to Severance Hall.    So if you can, try to come early.  Summer weekends in Little Italy are very popular and you will have a long wait."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food. Zuppa di Pesce and tortellini alla bolognese were both great."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week. I had the special, a bone in veal chop, while my date had the veal tortelini. Both were perfectly cooked and delicious. The servers were attentive, and the chef was great. A couple next to us had an issue with their food, and the chef replaced it immediately, and offered them a free meal at a later date to make up for it. Pricey, but delicious."}
{"text":"We never actually got a chance to eat at this place. Maybe you have to make reservations??? It's a tiny space. We were walking by and decided to stop in, could see that some tables were empty. We tried waiting in the doorway, making eye contact with the bartender, but after several minutes just left when no one came over to greet us. Do they not have a host/hostess or waitstaff?"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, atmosphere, wait staff.  The food is authentic Italian - the head chef (Pepe) used to work at Valerio, which is I think the best restaurant in Little Italy aside from Il Bacio.   Good: * The food is just divine.  I have had the salmon linguine, a marvelous fennel salad, and a very fresh caprese salad.  I have also tried my dining companions' osso buco, trout, and cioppino.  I've had the lemon sorbet (homemade, served in a hollowed out lemon) and the tartufo.  All were undeniably excellent. * Wait staff is attentive, very friendly and quite willing to explain dishes, or to explain the ingredients, and to tell you what brand of olive oil or pasta (DeCecco's, actually) they use.  * It's not uncommon to hear people speaking in Italian here - my impression is that it seems to draw Italians from all over.  Can't think of anything bad about this place, except that it's a bit pricey.   Also, I don't know what's common practice at restaurants but I wonder why they use boxed instead of fresh pasta, but then again, the pasta dish I had was quite nice.     I hope this place does well - it's so much better than the restaurant that used to occupy this space.  Edited: Corrected a couple details 8/22"}
{"text":"One word- TIRAMASU!!!- it was delicious!!! I love this restaurant!- its my favorite so far in little Italy. Il Bacio means kiss in Italian hence the romantic decor. The company was amazing! The wine delicious - montepusciano . The appetizers - OMG you MUST have the beat salad even if you don't like beets. Trust me. Calamari was good as was the shrimp scampi.  The owner Antonio is so friendly and so down to earth. Can't wait to go back and try the veal. :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were invited out by acquaintances and when we arrived they had already ordered drinks and appetizers.   If they hadn't I would have walked right back out. The place smelled like urine. Also as the restaurant filled up more and the kitchen got busier in the course of the evening, the smoke from the kitchen was visible in the air in the dining room.   Our waiter had no idea what he was doing. He couldn't even recommend wine to us from their largely unimpressive wine list.  The menus were dirty and when he was giving them to us, they fell on the floor and he just picked them up without wiping them and out them on out table.   The food selection is fairly small I would say -  usually I would consider this a promising sign for freshness.  Unfortunately today is the second day of a food poisoning that I suffered after eating here.   Also the place is very dark and has no atmosphere.    Unfortunately there was nothing nice about that evening for me to write about."}
{"text":"Were we at the wrong restaurant? What a disappointment! I had heard and read some pretty good things about IL Bacio so we gave it a try last night. Won't be going back any time soon. There were 4 of us and the best that anyone had was mediocre. I should have been suspicious when at 8 o'clock on Saturday night the place was 75% empty and it just thinned out further from there. We all ordered drinks (the most complicated of which was Grey Goose on the rocks) and that took almost 20 minutes to arrive. We split 2 appetizers (sauteed calamari C- and prosciutto w/mozerella D+). The entees were linguine w/white clam sauce C+, a cheese ravioli, the hit of the evening B- and I had the Ciopino special, a solid D. The calamari inside was very chewy and tasteless, the scampi was served in the shell and took way too much effort to peel and the broth was amazingly bland. Every other ciopino that I have had has been bursting with falvor. Not this one. Now for the kicker. IT WAS $40!!! I know that I should have asked the price when ordering it but never in my wildest dreams did I think it would be so much. Had it been great, or even good, I probably would have just shrugged it off but that kind of money for a seriously disappointing dish just really hurt. With so many other good Italian restaurants in Little Italy, I don't see this one sticking around very long without some BIG improvements."}
{"text":"The reviews I've been reading and the praise I've been hearing have been through the roof. I needed to see if IL Bacio could possibly live up to the bloated hype. Now, I am really torn in writing this review, but also feel compelled to set the record straight....   I'm sad to report that IL Bacio really isn't anything special. Yeah, I get it; the owner is from Italy, he's dreamy, charismatic and every time you take a bite of the gnocchi, you have visions of Vito Corleone dancing in your head. It transports you back to the homeland. Really people? Just because you're Italian, doesn't mean everything you cook is divine. Same goes for any other culture. Not every American can cook a steak. Hell, not every American can poor a proper bowl of cereal without Googling for instructions. I really don't understand the free pass given to restaurant because an owner/chef is from a certain country.   Now, onto the meal. To start, our group ordered the salumi plate which turned out to be a few slices of prosciutto drenched in oil. Personally, I could've done without the oil. Prosciutto is already a fatty piece of greasy meat. The additional pool of oil was unnecessary.   Next, I ordered the gnocchi which turned out to be one of the least interesting plates of gnocchi I've ever had. All the little balls of pasta dumplings came arranged on top of a bed of bland tasting sauce.   For dessert, I ordered the tiramisu which I pretty much have to get whenever I see it on the menu. Like the two other previous courses, bland and rather forgettable. I also found it weird that it came served in a small pudding dish instead of the typical slice on a plate.    Meanwhile, a pot-bellied older man next to us kept moaning loudly with each bite. The sounds coming from him was either a call for immediate medical attention or serious, undefinable pleasure. I couldn't help but notice, but as we'd soon find out, this was his way of showing his praise for the food he was stuffing down his throat. Afterwards, the portly looking man, continuing his praise of IL Bacio, told us with much candor and great certainty that \"THIS is the best restaurant in all of Cleveland!\" I looked at him completely dumbfounded. I want what he had. Because the three of us couldn't believe the claim coming from this man's mouth. Really guy? The best in all of Cleveland? After holding back laughter, the old man challenged us in asking what some of our favorite places were. After taking turns in rattling off a few favs, the man looked confused as if not ever hearing of any of our suggestions.   The moral of the story: Everyone has differing opinions. Sometimes vastly different. Appearance isn't everything either. Trust your palate, not the hype."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland! I've been here a few times, and each time its great. Its really authentic northern Italian cuisine, and the owner is always there. The food is exceptional, and I'm pretty sure the menu changes periodically. Service is impeccable. The only downside is it's small, and can get crowded/loud on a Friday/Saturday night. The food makes it waaay worth it though!"}
{"text":"I had the privilege of being the special guest of Antonio Calendra, the proprietor. I have, over the past year, made excellent friends among the expat Italian community and they love their national cuisine, and they love Antonio and Il Bacio. The ingredients are at peak flavor and the prep is perfect. It is a small dining room in Cleveland's Little Italy that presents Italian cuisine in her full glory. I had a both the pasta Bolognese and Linguine alla Vongole, both redolent of sausage and sweet clams, pasta prepared to perfect al dente. The veal cutlet with bone in was masterfully prepared. The trout was full of flavor, and the filet, normally a bland cut, was a standout for grilling perfection and the sweet wine reduction that accompanied it. While I can't say that every patron will experience this! I would hope that every lover of Italian cuisine will have an opportunity to sample la dolce vita as I have. buon apetito.  Dessert: cheesecake, limoncello, and tiramisu. The tiramisu is an almost religious experience. The wines and liqueurs after dinner were perfect."}
{"text":"Pricey, but very good. The veal dishes, seared snapper and cioppino were done perfectly, my only wish would be a more substantial broth in the cioppino. All the desserts disappeared quickly, especially their version of tiramisu. We will definitely return to taste more of the menu."}
{"text":"The best Italian food we've found in the area. Terrific atmosphere and the service is wonderful. We've been there a few times already and always had a great experience."}
{"text":"Great service - the owner welcomes you and actually serves the food with the waiter.  He is very attentive to his guests.  They will adjust any dish per the customers request.  This is authentic Italian food.  The owner is from Italy.  Probaby the best Italian food I have ever eaten. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is what you look for in a Little Italy restaurant....cozy with an old world flavor and great food. Mix that with the exuberance of the new owner Eddie and the culinary skills of a new chef and you have a great dining experience. We asked the chef to create something for us and surprised us with a fantastic ravioli appetizer. Each course that came out was better than the last. We shared lamb chops, pasta, fillets and mussels...all perfectly prepared. Eddie, the young owner, works the room and makes sure everyone is happy. The customer service is top notch. There is a new and young feel to this place. You won't be disappointed, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"When I was told I could take a few close family members out for a nice evening to celebrate my 25th with my company, I wanted to pick a nice place.  When I realized that I'd already promised to take my folks to the Mannheim Steamroller concert at CSU right before Christmas, the location narrowed.  I'm a fan of Little Italy so I chose this place.    In a couple of words, the experience was simply fabulous.    Barely watching the numbers we ordered champagne to toast my achievement, a calamari appetizer that was tender and tasty, dinner wine, meals (salmon, pasta) that were very well done, after dinner drinks, and dessert.  At least one person had the divine Tiramisu.    Given the time since we were there, I'm struggling to provide more details, but suffice it to say, we were not disappointed.    We did have reservations for 5:00 (when they opened).  They seated us a little before 5, which was a blessing given the time we took and the time of the concert.  Parking is very limited in their lot and on the street.  There is valet provided at a bar down the street (seemed a little risky, but I'm not a big-city guy).  In summary, you don't have to spend like we did as the prices are reasonable for a nice night out and Little Italy.  I believe you will be pleased with this place."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a Sunday night for dessert and some coffee before releasing our daughter to her freshman year at college. We enjoyed a quiet time, with an enjoyable atmosphere, and savored their delicious homemade tiramisu. It was overall a pleasant experience, and will definitely visit again some day for dinner."}
