{"text":"The most amazing chicken fingers I have ever had, served with fresh crispy perfectly seasoned fries. Their lamb shank is to die for, will always melt in your mouth. These guys know how to keep a standard of quality that you cannot match for their prices. 

They play great music, a mix of all types of rock with the occasional Irish music."}
{"text":"I only come in on Tuesday's for the wing special. It's buy 6 get 6 free. You get a dozen wings for $10 which is pretty good. Th wings are huge and there good flavours to choose from. It does get packed with students. Good wings and food prices."}
{"text":"We really like the fried pickles, the piri piri chicken wrap (wrapped in naan!), and the wings. 

Be warned that the wrap is extremely spicy, and this is coming from 2 people who put hot sauce on everything! The hamburgers I've tried have been so-so, and the sweet potato fries are better than the regular thick-cut fries they have (and I despise sweet potato fries, but am willing to concede this!). 

The street-side terrasse they added this summer is really cute, with fresh herbs growing in the planters! 

Yes it's unfortunate that Cunningham's is not on the water-side of the street, but you'll find better food here than at 95% of the restaurants across the way. Have your meal here, and then go for a walk along the boardwalk instead of eating at one of the other restaurants (unless it's Violet Angel, which is also delicious and has a cute terrasse). You'll thank me later. And have that piri piri sandwich, if you can handle the heat!"}
{"text":"People often ask me how a restaurant gets a five star review. For me it's simple, when a place offers something amazing. In this case, it's the wings. They are the best you'll ever have. Order them without any sauce, ask for the sauce on the side. Prepare your taste buds for chicken wing utopia! It will set a new baseline of greatness.   Mmmmm"}
{"text":"Everyone talks about the chicken wings and they are fabulous,they make the best fish and chips around,huge portion perfect cook on the fish every time,the service is attentive,and friendly not usually a long wait time.a great place to just hang out,now with a small patio.a real gem in Ste.Annes"}
{"text":"Cunninghams is one of those jewels that inhabit the small towns like Sainte-Anne-De-Bellevue that people lunge for.

Cunninghams is a small pub offering pretty good food (BEST WINGS I've ever had in my life), the most satisfying deserts I've ever had, a decent selection of beer, decent atmosphere and above average space management. Even when crowded, the tables were arranged in such way that moving around was still possible without tucking in the stomach too much.

I've never tasted something so good as the fried cheese cake. Dear holy mighty god of diabetes was it amazing.

On the downside, with quality came the price and it's not outrageously expensive but it does take a toll on a student's wallet! So be careful!

Also in all my visits, I've only seen that blonde older waitress smile and be friendly once... :S!"}
{"text":"Used to be the happening place on a Thursday night with all my friends from school.

The quality of food has gone down or maybe it's because I don't have my beer goggles on lol

Curry poutine is 16 dollars for double cheese don't do it. It's just 4 curds with some grated cheese. Curry sauce is very watery they need to thicken it. Fries weren't anything fancy.

Burger was nothing special I mean for 100 bucks u would think they would have something yummy.

Wings used to be u can pick 2 of watch and now if u buy 12 u can pick 2 flavours. They are however 20 dollars but they're huge wings so that's a plus. Get garlic and honey and the crispy ones they sweet ones aren't as good.

My beer was flat couldn't drink it."}
{"text":"Great bar with good music and some very good bands on the weekends. The beer is good but the selection could be better. The food is good but the wings are out of the world ! Wish they did delivery !! Friendly atmosphere and nice staff !"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in about a decade (back to my JAC days), but it was a familiar feeling as soon as I walked in. Manager is cheery but rough attitude, works for the location but seems as though he might be too comfortable with \"oh it's a student town\" mentality as the way he speaks to guests leaves something to be desired. Fortunately the wait staff were on point so it helped make it a more \"service\" atmosphere. We went on wing night and took a while to be sat due to the size of our group. Wings took close to a half hour to come out which was longer than expected despite the place being busy. Sweet potato fries has a burnt taste to them despite not being overcooked, usually a sign of unchanged fryer oil. Onion rings were just ok. Wing sauces were good and the size of the wings is always a plus. Beer was flat and unpleasant, second pint of a different draft was well carbonated however. Grabbed a deep fried cheesecake for dessert which was delicious. 

Many menu items and beers that are overpriced, wouldn't go unless on a specials night. Wing night gets 5 stars but overall theyre only worth a pint and a snack rather than to be a regular's bar for me."}
{"text":"Best wings in Montreal by far! Wings are huge, sauces are fantastic and there is a large variety so they cater to any potential fried chicken desire. Personal favourites are the peri peri, suicides and thai chili but the honey garlic is just behind. Rest of the menu is is rich, homey feeling and overall fantastic place to meet up for a beer or glass of wine and a good meal with friends or partner. Bonus there are always lunch and dessert specials each week to change things up. This week's Candy Bar Cheesecake looks pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Disappointing New years day dinner. 
We've been there before and enjoyed the food but last night's Pub menu was not expected for dinner at 6:00 pm.
We had checked their website prior to going but there wasn't any  mention of a limited supper menu."}
{"text":"Hands down the best wings on the island.
Tuesday night 2 for 1 wings are a must.
I love going with the guys, picking from their large selection of beers and having the meatiest, juciest and best sauced wings around.
Staff is very friendly and helpful.
Sometimes it gets a bit crowded due to its small size, but it's worth the wait every time!"}
