{"text":"Terrible first-time experience. Ordered delivery thru grubhub. Upon opening our food, we found a long, dark red hair on one of our entrees. I called our driver back (Dan W.), who was most apologetic. He gave me the restaurants number to call in hopes of remedying the situation. I called the store, and spoke to Paul Sabunani (\"manager\" who happens to own this hole with his wife Tina). Immediately Paul was defensive and implied that I was trying to pull one over on him. He had the audacity to offer us a half off appetizer next time we come in. That was all he was willing to do. He then hung up on me. Horrible customer service skills. Hey Paul, lay off the curry and make Dan manager... It can't get any worse than how you're running it into the ground. Dan went above and beyond trying to make things right. All in all, grubhub's customer service came through. We'll never order from this place again. This seems to be a recurring issue."}
{"text":"I was getting ready to use my Google Offers coupon for South Aiken Bar & Grille and headed to Yelp for pointers/suggestions before my visit, only to be mildly horrified by some of the reviews here (those stories from February '12 about the owner/owner's wife yelling about salad are pretty wild). I always check Yelp before buying any Groupons/LivingSocial deals/Google Offers, and I guess the eight 1-2 star reviews that have appeared since I bought the coupon in early February 2012 really made the average rating plummet from whatever it was that lead me to believe it would be worth giving this place a chance. I was a little shaken, a little disgusted, and a little afraid, but I decided to suck it up and try it anyway.

So I went on a Saturday night (last night, to be exact) around 11 p.m., and was surprised that it was such a narrow space and much more bar-like than bar-and-grill like. The bar was mostly full (there was some sports game on, and it was pretty loud whenever something exciting happened), so my boyfriend and I headed to the back. A host intercepted and cheerfully seated us, and we occupied a table for four. Our server was prompt, despite tending bar, and was also friendly (she even gave us some Halloween candy!). First, we ordered Chinook IPAs, which was probably one of the more exotic beers of their limited tap selection. It looked like they had a fair amount of happy hour drink specials every day of the week, though. Then we placed our food order: a half dozen garlic Parmesan chicken wings ($5.99) and a 12-inch Hawaii Five-O Pie (bacon, pineapple, onion, spicy cappicola, red sauce; $12.45).

Both the wings and the pizza were delicious. Neither was especially greasy, and both were very fresh and flavorful. The pizza crust was exceptional, in my opinion--a little thin and crispy, yet doughy on the inside and golden all around. Their sauce was good, too. And by the time I got to the leftovers this afternoon, it all still tasted really good when I reheated it.

My best guess is that this place has had a dramatic overhaul in management and/or ownership since some of the terrible occurrences were documented here, although who knows if my one visit could have been a stroke of incredible luck. But from my point of view, South Aiken Bar & Grille is nothing to be feared. The atmosphere isn't anything special, and I probably won't go out of my way to head back here, but considering the food is good, the staff was friendly, and the kitchen's open late (which was one of the main points that piqued my interest), I don't have a reason not to go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Wanted to have delivery and surely did not want italian. Went on eat24 and ordered a bbq burger fries.granted it was delivery and food cools down, but if i need to warm it to make it mediocre edible, wtf. Burger was good, being smart to have it well done(even though i know it was nuked) and i know cause it came w an onion ring and the ring was unedible. Pls. Dont get me started w the Islys bbq sauce. Gues s i was really hungry"}
{"text":"I grabbed a quick steak quesadilla for $6 on special and it was loaded with steak, peppers and cheese. It basically hit the spot. It looks like they have a good beer selection and drink specials as well."}
{"text":"The service at South Aiken Bar &  Grill undulates from below par to the worst to friendly - but unfortunately, it tends to be on the less favorable side more often than not. The cleanliness is passable but the physical menus themselves are rather disgusting to hold and look at while trying to decide what to order. The menu is lacking and they usually run out of something on it by the evening. The only slightly worthwhile menu item is the pizza and that's really only ideal when you have had a few drinks and want a late night snack. I would not recommend it unless you want to overpay for suboptimal food. The crowd is a mixed bag but generally brings in  some questionable people who are going to say some inappropriate things and the staff has joined in conversations with patrons using racially charged epitaphs, slurs, and just about anything else you could think of that unprofessional. Not a great place considering it has a great location."}
{"text":"We order take out from here a lot. Sometimes it has been good but the last two times have been terrible. Last week the turkey club came with toast so over done it crumbled into nothing. Tonight we ordered the same thing thinking last weekend might have been a one time thing and got a sandwich with a huge hole in the bread. They should care more about what they send out. I gave them a 3 for the other handful of times the orders have been okay."}
{"text":"Delivery was 45 minutes past the due time there was no lemon or tartar sauce with the fish as stated on menu no ketchup for fries or onion rings my son said the burger tasted like something from McDonalds overall not happy and will not order again"}
{"text":"Ordered from here last night via CampusFood.  It was pretty cheap - a grilled cheese + fries, a burger + fries, and an extra order of fries came to about $15 after tip.

The problem was that delivery was horrifically slow.  After an hour, we called to see if they were having trouble finding us, since our street is extremely dark.  The girl cheerfully told us that our food hadn't even left yet.  After another half hour, the food arrived but it was ice cold.  Once it was heated up, it was pretty decent for the price.  I could tell that the fries would have been good if they were fresh out of the fryer.

I wouldn't mind eating here again, but I think I would avoid having it delivered."}
{"text":"Pretty dingy bar on the edge of walnut street. The food is nothing to write home about. It is only good for if you've been out drinking and need food (ie pizza and French fries) at 2 AM. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend going here to eat or drink."}
{"text":"This place should go out of business fast! We came in a group of students to eat some pizza. The owner's wife (at the register) began yelling and cussing at us for NO reason at all. As a matter of fact, she called us some of the worst names I have ever been called before just because I asked her if they are still serving salads. This is place is ghetto. On another night we came, she came up to us the minute we finished our pizza and told us to get the f out because there are other people who want to eat. She also has a bouncer- yes a bouncer at a pizza place. This is because this place is ghetto and she often gets in fights with people. I asked her why she was talking to me that way when we were bringing her business. Her response to that was get the f out you f***ing b****. This was a very weird experience that has NEVER happened to me before. Anyways, you really should not support these kind of businesses in Pittsburgh. No one would at any other city in the rest of the US. Don't go here."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a late night greasy fried food fix, this is the place to come, sadly I live a mere minutes distance from this place.  

Their kitchen is usually open until 3:30am and if I've been out in shadyside I often come here for a slice of pizza on my walk home.  

They also have six packs for carry out which is useful sometimes.  

Last time i went with a group of friends we tried one of their hugee calzones, jalepeno poppers and the wings.  Its a really small place and their bar seems to never be really busy like shady grove or marios but it is a chill place to just get good bar food.  I always crave their pizza and chicken tenders, yum.."}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza. At best. Hours decided upon each night. Ie tonight it was open til 2a but \"the cook decided to leave at 1230 so we can't make any more pizza\". When asked why, bartender goes \"maybe you should've been here earlier.\" I said \"but you're still open for food for well over an hour,\" her response [shrugs shoulders]. Questionable business practice, pretty terrible and greasy food. Only redeeming factor is that they're intermittently open late.... when they want to be"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of visiting this establishment at approximately 2:30 AM on a Sunday morning.  This place deserves 2 stars alone just for being open past 2 AM when the entire city tends to shut down.  I had the veggie pizza which was decent.  Certainly nothing special, but at 2:30 AM when you're looking for that late night cholesterol laden goodness, pretty much anything edible will suffice.  The price was a little more than what I would like to pay, but once again, worth it given the circumstances.  If other establishments in the area would follow suit, they'd do well."}
{"text":"I've had excellent luck with the pizza from this place -- some of my favorite in Pittsburgh! Cheap beer on tap too."}
{"text":"Bring s. Aiken back. Pizza of a lifetime. An absolute injustice to Pittsburgh that this establishment was closed. The white pizza and the BBQ chicken pizza are amazing and I still dream about them."}
{"text":"Never been here in person, but definitely cannot recommend ordering delivery. We called in our order - phone service was nice enough, she even recommended a smaller pizza to save us money (the menu we were looking at only had one size). After waiting over an hour and a half for it to arrive, we called and were given the excuse that the driver was on his way but having trouble finding us (does he not have a cell phone with which to call us?) and then another one about the roads being bad (there had been a light snowfall and the roads were totally clear, plus we live on a major route not far from the restaurant). My partner who made the call said it sounded like the guy on the phone was talking to the driver in person. Nevertheless, when the pizza finally arrived, it was cold as can be. It was not delivered in a hot-bag, just a fancy new Volvo. By the time we reheated it in our oven, it didn't matter what it tasted like. 

If bullshit is your favorite topping, or you prefer the cold leftover pizza experience, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"12 of us from the tepper school of business went to south aiken bar and grill for late night pizza on thursday night( feb 23 rd ) and had the most horrific service experience; so much so I am considering reporting the restaurant to the better business bureau or another consumer forum of the like. There is now an Indian woman who owns the place( from the same suburb as me in Mumbai , India) . First of all we noticed her really aggressive attitude because the moment people finished their meal- she asked them to get out! ( those were her exact words!) we stood in line and 2 of my friends asked her if there were any salads on the menu- the second time she was asked- she slammed her hands against the table and said\" you FU!@@#@#g Bitch, i told you we didnt have salads\" one of us then came forward and said \" why are you talking to us like this, do you want our business or not ?\" and she said \" I dont care either way, you can get out \"- she  continued to spew a whole lot of verbal abuse and another guy friend leaned in toward her and said \" stop talking to us like that\" The male bouncer (!)standing next to her then shoved my friend against the wall- seriously who has a bouncer in a pizza salon?!! in about 10 minutes time, this had escalated to ugly proportions so we decided to be smart and leave. After all, there was no need to be treated like this anymore- it was just unacceptable and we had nothing to gain by stooping to their level.I was in such shock - we actually toyed with the idea of calling the cops to intervene- however it had been a long night and decided it was still futile. The woman owner is the most bitter woman I have met- surely she has had great turmoil in her life to be such an awful human being .when we narrated this incident in all of our classes the next day, it turned out most of our classmates had faced similar incidents and never went back there again. I am surprised south aiken bar and grill is still in service. This has been my worst eating experience in the city of pittsburgh and I hope this review will help caution some of you about the place. Thank you for reading."}
{"text":"Most of their food is just okay; I've been there once and got fried mushrooms, loaded cheese fries, and wings.

The cheese fries were good, the mushrooms were kinda not good. 

But the wings were some of the best I had.  The bartender had his own sauce recipe (not on the menu): he said it was mayo, hot sauce and I think some italian seasoning/dressing.  Either way, they were saucy &  delicious.  They are also fried/breading covered, which is not usual.  But it made them that much better."}
{"text":"Ok pizza.  However, good luck if u have any interaction with the bartender. She was the most inhumane person on 7/16/2010-7/17/2010.  The owner isnt much better.  Only support this place if you absolutely must eat after drinking in shadyside."}
{"text":"This place is reasonably inexpensive, with good drink specials, but the food is nothing more than slightly below average bar food (with a decent but unimpressively tasting pizza menu).    It's about what you'd expect, and earns a solid \"Meh\" rating from this reviewer."}
{"text":"Their menu looked like a great place to go to... Especially when looking for a late night place to eat. However, I was HIGHLY disappointed. I ordered chicken tenders and fries and my boyfriend ordered mild wings. It honestly tasted like it was just frozen store bought food. It was also quite expensive (around 28$) for the value and quality of food that was given. I'm sure it's a fun place to have a couple of drinks but I will not be returning to eat here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went here because of a restaurant.com gift certificate that needed using.  Our server was friendly enough but messed up a few of the sandwiches ordered, turning my friend's bacon tomato grilled cheese into a plain grilled cheese.  They did let us order a pizza to go on the same check since we hadn't hit the order minimum, but there's nothing particularly special about this place that would make me return, other than paying $15 for all of this thanks to the certificate.  And I'm not sure even that would do it.  The manager walked by our table several times without asking us how we were doing.  Also we were seated right next to the bathroom despite other empty tables so my friend's chair got hit anytime someone went in.  There was a strange scent of onions coming from the bathroom as well.  With so many other options in Shadyside, this is one I won't be coming back to."}
{"text":"Their food is just OK. Somewhat inconsistent with fries. I'm glad I've been here before the new owner took over."}
