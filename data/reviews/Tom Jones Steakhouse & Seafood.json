{"text":"I came here for my birthday last month and was quite disappointed. A friend of mine has this place as one of her favourites and I always trust her opinions on restaurants. I knew to expect an old school setting which I totally loved. We came on a Friday evening and was surprised that by peak dinner time we were one of three tables. I didn't mind that so much but it's a little telling.   I ordered the filet mignon and my husband the peppercorn sirloin. We both ordered medium rare but they both came medium, totally over cooked and tasteless. The vegetables seemed like they were from a frozen bag and same with the fries.  The garlic bread, however, was delicious and the drinks are poured generously. That being said, it's a steakhouse and if you can't get medium rare right then that's an issue, especially for those prices. May as well go to Jacob's if you're looking in that price range.  Loved the piano player, he was great! Good mix of music. Would come back for a drink by the piano bar but not for steak. You're better off going to the Keg."}
{"text":"I thought this place would be a little bit of a secret, old school fantastic steakhouse...  The steak was \"ok\", certainly nothing to write home about, and worse than other \"go to\" places around the YYZ.  The wine list was over priced   We got to dessert and the waiter recommended the pecan pie, which arrived over-microwaved (we burned our tongues)"}
{"text":"This is the most charming, beautiful place and so romantic. You feel like you are in an old time country club. The servers wear tux's and are very accommodating. The piano player was amazing! He can sing and play any song you ask. We had the best time sitting around the piano and requesting songs and chatting with the piano player. This is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This place is horribly overpriced and just ugly as sin inside. Arrived and got the \"your in the wrong place\" looks, probably because we're under 30. After 211$ plus tip, we got a 70$ bottle of boujelais, prime rib entree, tiger shrimp entree, and baked apple dessert. The veggies were frozen. The shrimp tasted terrible. The prime rib was mediocre at best and the \"baked apple dessert\" was 2 rings of apple (not even a whole apple) dusted in cinnamon and sugar, with a scoop of ice cream. What a rip off! I would have had a better meal from the keg, Baton Rouge, or literally ANY OTHER STEAKHOUSE, for less money. Don't go here!"}
{"text":"Their steaks aren't all that and definitely not worth the price we're paying. It is still good, but not mind-blowingly amazing. They are cooked to your preference and taste juicy and tender. But it lacks that little element that takes it to next level. Service is excellent but I don't like the ambience. It feels too old with traditional styles and very dark too."}
{"text":"There is no other place like this in Toronto, possibly Canada. It's a gem beyond all gems. The piano player is clever, intuitive, and seems to know any song you can think of (and his arrangements and flare are better than the originals). The servers are attentive and aware. The food is to die for. The drink selection is superb. I cannot put my joy of Tom Jones into words.   This really is a place out of time. Come here. It's beautiful."}
{"text":"I've been to this steakhouse several times over the years and have never been disappointed. Until this last time.  While the vegetables were done to perfection, there's no other word I can think of for the 8 oz bacon-wrapped Fillet Mignon I had: bland.  Also, the wine list needs revision -- why have a table of contents if it has no bearing on the wines that follow?  That said, the ambiance was, as always, very elegant."}
{"text":"Meh... Pretty cool building... sat downstairs... service was good  Standard steak house fare.... nothing too special   Seating quite comfortable Cool building... did i say that ?"}
{"text":"Good quality steaks and seafood. An old style steakhouse with black tie waiters and ceaser salad prepared table side. Prices are high but expected for the food and location/service."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner with my girlfriend, I ordered the filet mignon wrapped in bacon .... and have to say it was amazing!! Cooked perfectly, melted in your mouth. My girlfriend had the lobster tails which were amazing as well. We ordered oysters for the appetizer and was not impressed, didn't even finish them (hence the 4 starts) not sure if it was the actual oysters or just not fresh. I'd stay away from the oysters and go with the steak and you will be pleasantly pleased. OVERALL a great steakhouse, great service, nice old school classic detour. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tom Jones is certainly an experience, an enjoyable one at that.  Food Quality: The actual quality of the steak was outstanding. Absolutely the most tender steak I've ever eaten (New York Strip). Overall it was quite good, but it did lack seasoning, thus leaving something to be desired in the flavor category. Tom Jones is fine dining, so don't expect it to be cheap. The 'strip was over 50 dollars.  Service: As expected the service was excellent. Quick and courteous. Friendly and warm. I was quite pleased by it.  Decor: I absolutely love the dining room. It's dark and intimate. It has stained glass windows, which I absolutely love. One staircase doubles as a bookshelf, and there is rich wood everywhere. I really love the atmosphere in this place.  Worth a visit for a special occasion, or a night out with a special someone. Overall a great place."}
{"text":"Sexism is live and well at Tom Jones  I eat at Jacobs & Harbour 60 regularly. I enjoy really good wine often and I'm always in great restaurants having great experiences. I guess I'm lucky that I've never been in a situation as the one that transpired at Tom Jones in December 2017, we went for traditional steak, not to step back in time and certainly not for sexist servers treating women like second class citizens.  I took a group of 20 clients for dinner close to the holidays and some of the party arrived before me. One of my clients (a man) ordered wine and when I arrived with some other clients we decided we'd wanted another option (he picked a Malbec which isn't always a crowd pleaser). I asked for the wine list and was immediately refused. Strange I thought, so I asked again and was told in a condescending manner that \"the gentleman had already made the selection for the table\" at which point I explained some of us wanted another option. After 20 minutes (and walking over to find another server to ask for a list) I was finally given the wine list. I made my selection only to have the server pat me on the shoulder and tell me he could \"make a better selection for me, hun\". I declined, and once I firmly insisted on the wine we'd selected the server went downstairs only to bring out a different selection while telling me \"this one is better\". After again insisting I realized the service I was receiving was because of my sex, not a bad server. I was later condescended too again when my meat came too cooked with a \"dear that's what a medium rare steak looks like\".  Insult to injury, I left my business card and asked for a call as I wasn't about to kick up a fuss in front of clients. No one called me. I followed up, I was told again someone would call. On my forth call I spoke to the owner who promised me I would be his first call in the new year... today is April 8th... haven't heard from him. Maybe next time I'll have a man call?"}
{"text":"Excellent steakhouse that is old school. Old school excellent service (tuxedos) and menu. But, so good! Prices are high for the steaks, but quality is excellent. Definitely, have the Cherries Jubilee made at your table for dessert. Felt like I was in 1975 and it was a very nice thing.   Add beautiful decor and a good pianist, and it makes for a lovely evening.   $300 for two, including a good bottle of wine, mains, dessert, cocktail, tax and 20% tip."}
{"text":"It is really sad to see such a nice establishment to have poor food and inconsistent service.  It is like they really missed the half century and never got caught up.  It is anice old building but everything seems worn out.  There is no warmth in the place.  The servers were nice but too obtrusive especially when I was in deep conversation, they would appear and ask if everything was fine.  I had the rib steak and some wine.  They were fine except I feel like I could have had the same meal from the Keg for half the price.  Sigh.  So if you want to spend your bucks and get dressed up definitely go elsewhere.  They are not bad but for the price they are just not good enough."}
{"text":"Was just talking to a friend going to TIFF in a few weeks and recommended this place, one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto. Great ambience, excellent old world service, good food. I love that they have Steak Diane for two on the late night menu. They still make table side Caesar salad the proper way with the ground mustard, anchovy, eggs and everything. We used to just drink martinis at the bar with their cheesy bread and pickles. Heaven! They had a great piano player at one time, Terrence, who has moved on. He was the brother of the lead singer from Styx and sounded just like his brother when he'd do Sail Away. We tipped him heavily for that lol, because we know he hated it, but it cracked us up. We had dinner with our inlaws here after we moved away but came back to visit. They had a music student playing classical music. My father in law complained about the prices on the wine list, but he lives in the Niagara region and knows what the LCBO is like. Steak houses should not be cheap. I found it was a good value for the money."}
{"text":"This is that dark, old school steakhouse with a wonderful piano player and phenomenal service.   Came here on a Thursday around 7 - very quiet but around 8 the piano player arrived and brightened things up a bit.   Started with the green salad and the French onion soup -- the soup is beyond good and ordered a small filet with their crispy fries and onion rings. The missing star came from the way my filet was cooked. I prefer medium rare and it came out a bit more well done however, once acknowledged they were happy to take it back and fix it.   Their wine list is pretty superb. We had an '89 cab that, once opened up a bit was so unique and tasty. And the fact they didn't botch the cork on a wine that old was rather impressive.   As mentioned, the piano player was icing on the cake. He came over and asked for recommendations and once we were finished with our meal we ended up getting another glass of wine and sitting around the piano with some other individuals and enjoying a very late night."}
{"text":"This is an old school steakhouse, and it does it well. Entering was a bit intimidating as it feels quiet and reserved, but once the service got started we enjoyed everything! The hospitality of the owner?/manager?, the waitstaff, was just great. Had escargot, and caesar salad made table side the old school way. Chateaubriand was incredible. Next time I want to try the porterhouse. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice dinner out in Toronto. I've been to Barberians and Harbour 60, and I think this place beat them both."}
{"text":"This is a classic steakhouse with low lighting, a comfortable bar with a piano. The staff was courteous, knowledgable and efficient. We never were hurried or had to wait; we had time to talk and enjoy our meal. Three of us had the Caesar salad which is prepared table side and is very good. We had bacon wrapped filets and a NY steak. I don't usually order a filet but heard that they were supposed to be very good. We all agreed they were outstanding. The person who ordered the NY said it also was very good, but tried the filet and would have that next time. Our desserts were cherries jubilee and chocolate mousse cake. Excellent also. I highly recommend this restaurant and would like to return in the future."}
{"text":"This place is very romantic and the food is great. Was there 1/2/16. Best steakhouse in Toronto."}
{"text":"Best steak restaurant in the city! Hard to locate but that's what Google search is for. The restaurant is in a little small house. The ambiance is classic and intimate.The Caesar salad is made right in front of you with fresh ingredients and the cheesy bread is to die for. Pricey but worth every penny."}
{"text":"I had a really great dinner!  Earlier tonight I took someone there for their birthday and the waiter was professional the food delicious and the drinks perfectly poured. The food was actually delicious!  Why am I  so surprised?  It all comes down to a steak house that has been around as long as this one has is often stuck in a time warp. Well it is stuck in a time warp but it was a delicious food and service experience. I will be back!"}
{"text":"**NOTE:  This review is for cocktails only  Sort of stumbled upon this place by accident and so glad we did! It's near the Omni King Edward where we were staying and we saw a sign for \"piano bar,\" which instantly appealed to us.  Piano player is lovely, great, relaxing atmosphere.  Not dueling pianos, just classical, mostly Broadway music.  Very classy joint though you would never know it from the outside--looks like a complete hole in the wall!  I was honestly scared to go up the steps to see what I might find.  Bartender was very friendly.  Drinks were STRONG! And reasonably priced for what appears to be a very expensive steakhouse.  I'd love to come back to try the food--looks like a lovely, romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best in Toronto, as true classic. If your looking for a true steakhouse experience, this is it.  Classic setting,  with a live piano player. I had the French onion soup and my wife the Ceasar, both perfect. We had the Chateaubriand, and it was great. Not many places in Toronto even have Chateaubriand. Very charming and the service was great. I can only think of two places in the 416 that captures the true steakhouse experience."}
{"text":"Tom Jones is a great place to go to if you're looking for a high quality steak.  Food quality:  I got a New York strip steak, which had one of the absolute best textures i've ever experienced in a steak before.  The flavour was a bit lacking, but the quality of the meat was so good that I was willing to overlook the lack of spices on the steak.  The price was very high (almost $60) but well worth it.  Atmosphere:  A really nice interior with some interesting decor.  A live pianist was playing for most of the duration that I was there.  Service:  There were hardly any customers when I went so the service was very quick and the staff was friendly, professional, and very well dressed."}
{"text":"Really cool place. Old building offset in a parking lot. Really cool structure. I took one of my employees here for a \"thank you dinner.\" We entered and were led upstairs to dimmed dining room. Very old school from the look and feel to how the waitstaff manage their tables.   We both order steak, appetizers (1 shrimp cocktail and 1 French Onion soup) - both were wonderful. The garlic bread they bring out is also yummy. Steaks were cooked to perfection.   When I say old school, I mean old school. They don't rush you through your food. The waiters space out everything so you can sit there and enjoy the experience. If you are in a hurry you'll have to let them know because they are really all about the elegant, pacing yourself, sitting back and just relaxing experience.   When I am in Toronto again I will more than likely stop in, even if alone."}
{"text":"This is by far the most romantic steakhouse in Toronto, live piano music, candlelights, old school classics.. totally Hollywood. The Rib steaks are cooked to perfection the way I like medium rear. Caesar salad prepared at the table side was delicious. Deserts, anything flambé are good. Service always attentive and professional. I traveled around but this place hands down it's one of the best in Canada or maybe in North America. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review because I travel all over North America on business and in my opinion this place is overpriced with very mediocre food. $300 for salad, 2 glasses of wine, 2 drinks, 2 dinners and one dessert and not worth it in my opinion. This place has a lovely decor and great piano bar. I would skip dinner and stop in for a drink next time. Bartender was very friendly and piano player was wonderful."}
{"text":"There aren't too many places like Tom Jones left. Old fashioned steak house with professional staff who tonight outnumbered the patrons. Be prepared to pay the big bucks to take a journey back in time.   We started sharing a Caesar salad for two prepared with care table-side by a gentleman who must have done it a thousand times. Delicious. Not your packaged salads. Our rib and strip steaks were done to a perfect medium rare, served with baked potatoes and veggies. Added a very large side of mushrooms to top it all off.   And they brought a complimentary cheese cake with berries for my wife's birthday!  Now you could find imperfections if you tried really hard, but with live piano players serenading a few tables with beautiful music, wood paneling all around and candlelight the experience was wonderful for a special occasion."}
{"text":"The first thing that came to mind when Tom Jones came up on my feed was \"It's a landlocked Captain Johns\".   Much like the erstwhile seafoodliner now mouldering for non-payment of taxes, Tom Jones is a relic of a restaurant in a relic of a building; a weird set-back from the parking lot near the King Edward hotel. The entryway is all stairs and formaldehyde smells, leading to an upstairs that screams degraded opulence. I'm not saying it's old and sad but literary fiends might think that Miss Havisham from Dickens' \"Great Expectations\" probably booked it for her wedding. Washrooms are all the way back downstairs; tough to navigate after a few martinis.   Service is old and crusty, though not necessarily in that delightfully curmudgeony stakehouse way. More in the \"please God let me get through this night so that I can just go home and feed my cats\" way.   Food is pretty standard steakhouse fare, carelessly executed.   Caesar salad is dinner and a show; would that the food was as tasteful as the show. French onion soup should be great at any steakhouse. It combines the cheapest vegetable on earth, and bones from the same animal that should appear on your plate. I appreciate a bit of booze in the bowl, but this soup tastes of pernod and bovril; inexcuseable ayt any steakhouse. My review should end here, in a huff of righteous indignation.    The entire table orders fillet and lobster. The filet is chewy.  If I were blindfolded I'd think I was eating a Keg sirloin. The lobster is a hate crime; overcooked to the point that it stubbornly refuses to exit its shell. I wrestle a few sodden bites, and give up in favour of the baked potato, which is sadly nuked.   At least the drinks are strong. I leave pretty buzzed, glad that work is picking up the tab for the cab."}
{"text":"It's amazing how I've never even heard of this place, but it's apparently been around since 1966.  Tom Jones looks quite like a large period home from the exterior, but inside it's a dark & cozy restaurant with lots of little nooks and crannies for privacy. The upstairs has a piano bar which was hopping on a Friday night.   Clientele seem to be mostly older businessmen types and some tourists.   Staff were delightful, we had two nice Greek waiters serving us and making small talk. One insisted on making us a caesar salad - he brought out a cart with ingredients and spent 10-15 minutes blending everything by hand in a bowl. It was quite impressive and fun to watch. The finished product was quite tasty too.  The menu is nothing exciting - steak and seafood. I tried a tuna steak, it was served with rice and veggies. Portion size was huge and it was cooked very rare (as I requested). It was a bit bland but hit the spot - I could only eat half. Moro mu (my DC) had the filet mignon which was delicious.  The wine menu here is out of control. Brilliant selection and very pricey, a glass of house red starting from $17.  Overall, very romantic, excellent service, food just adequate."}
{"text":"I have always loved this place, I am not a seafood lover. I have been to pretty much every big name steak resturant, from House of Chan, Carmans back in the day, Barbarians, Octagon, Harry's by the gardens when all the leafs ate there. I could name dozens more, that have come and gone.   Every time I have been to Tom Jones the Steaks, the Caesar salad, the service Have been tops every time, and over 30 years, that says a lot!"}
{"text":"Good food, really cool place with a lot of history! The place is fancy so dress nice. The food is expensive though !  I don't like how dark it is.. can't see the food haha, I could be eating dust.. but no the food was good. 4/5 stars"}
{"text":"good ambience, shitty food. the steak tasted like it had been thawed out in a gas station sink and the garlic bread tasted like it was from loblaws. the piano player refers to an ipad instead of sheet music, which is pretty funny. sucker as i am for the warm, bourbony ambience of the old school chop house, this place is all sizzle and no steak."}
{"text":"Came to Tom Jones on a Friday night with a couple of friends. We were greeted by the waiter at the entrance and was asked if we wanted to check our coats in. The waiter promptly tossed our coats like a bag of garbage to the table next to the entrance as we handed them in( Not a great impression sign #1).  Realized that the restaurant was overly empty for a Friday night as we proceeded to our table.( Not a great impression sign #2). The lighting was very dark, and the music was creepily outdated. As we proceeded with our order, we realized that enjoying the wine of choice was going to be more challenging than one might wish for. As we tried to order a bottle of their finest red, the waiter would return with bad news only, every wine we requested was out of stock( what are the chances?). This back and forth continued a couple of times, and we successfully ordered the first bottle. ( Not a great impression sign #3).  At this stage of the meal: 1. Wine: in the glass, flowing through veins 2. Apps ordered( Ceaser salad and oysters)  The waiter asked us if we wanted some garlic bread, and we said no.  Guess what shows up a couple of minutes later? Garlic bread.   Our initial instinct of refraining from the garlic bread was right, not tasty.   We continued and went head first with the order of the mains:  Fillet, Prime Rib( Medium-Rare), New York...  Here come the apps:  Oysters: Tasted funky, Did not get food poisoning Ceaser Salad: Death by garlic, too heavy. Destroys the palette( Not a great impression sign #4).   The waiter had a special technique of service. He would toss/ slide the plates to the table. Incredibly unique, however, seems a little rushed for a half- empty restaurant on a Friday night. ( Not a great impression sign #5).   As we tried ordering the second battle, the dance continued for three more rounds. Any wine we wanted was not available. The waiter brought a completely unrelated wine at the end. As we were anxious to wash down the meat some red, we caved.   Here come the mains:  I had the Prime- Rib, so I shall only speak on that( no I did not taste the others).  It was a crime scene... Punishable animal cruelty.   As I requested the waiter's attention to explain to him that my steak was heavily overcooked, the waiter asked me to cut if from the middle to actually prove that it was overcooked. Proceeded with the surgery, unfortunately, the patient was dead. Verdict: Steak was overcooked( medium well-done).( Not a great impression sign #6)  Got a new steak in 15 minutes, done right, medium rare. The chef approaches and tells me that the initial order he received for my steak was medium and blames the waiter.( Not a great impression sign #7)  As we walked out, our jackets were waiting for us on the table next to the entrance piled up, resembling the \"jackets on the bed\" during a house- party.( Not a great impression sign #8)  Surreal experience, no repeat, go to The Keg."}
{"text":"The five stars is for the steak alone. Both my boyfriend and I had the filet mignon... and wow. It was to die for. We both have never had anything so delicious and tender, that melted in your mouth like butter. Expensive, but worth it. We also felt a little looked at because we were young but who cares. You're there to enjoy yourself. Service was nice, as we came fairly late and they still allowed us to dine. We will definitely be back."}
