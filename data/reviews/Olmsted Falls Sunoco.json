{"text":"If you're suspicious of the reviews for this place, I get it. One of the reviewers has given every single place either a four or a five-star review. You might justifiably wonder how hard he is to please. The other guy did only one review-- for here-- and he gave it five stars.Plus, his hometown is in Texas  I'm a sour old S.O.B who used to be a chef. I gave Slyman's four stars-- partly dinging it on the food. I came here because I was looking for something different and they advertised in a community shopper with some pretty good coupons. And I will come back here.  Let's start with the obvious sticking point. It's definitely possible to do a good sandwich shop inside a gas station. If you make sandwiches, you're only as good (or as bad) as your ingredients. You buy the bread, meat and veggies from wholesalers-- very possibly the same suppliers as any other restaurant. There's no reason you can't be as good. (Even a gyro is mostly prepackaged.)  They have one genuinely killer dish here-- the hummus. It's locally made from scratch  and ridiculously good. You get about eight ounces for $3.99-- plain, spicy, roasted red pepper and pomegranate. It comes with two pita breads that are toasted and sprinkled with herbs. It dusts anything you can buy in a store-- and from many restaurants.  The plain is, I'm pretty sure, chick peas, salt, lemon juice, tahini and olive oil (there was a pool of oil atop the hummus-- good stuff, too). Very light and creamy-- not clumpy and thick. I think I make a better one (I add cumin and onion juice), but this was very good. My wife, as it happened, went to Aladdin's Tuesday and brought back some. This was better.  The pomegranate is interesting-- if you like the sweetness it adds, you might like it a lot. (I was nonplussed, but it comes with all the chunkies on top-- don't like it, just eat off the top layer and the base product is underneath. (I haven't had the red pepper or spicy yet. Since they all use the same hummus, I'd assume they are good.)  The pita bread is as good, if not better. Since we had them in both the gyro and the hummus, I'm sold on the quality. They'll sell you an extra pita for a buck. I'd do it.   It's hard to screw up a gyro-- you buy a loaf of meat, roast it on the veritcal spit and slice it  You judge them on the amount of meat you get (I'd guess six ounces), the quality of the sauce (pretty good, not great), and the pita.(exceptional).   The shredded lettuce was dismal and the tomatoes were pretty sad. I'd skip those. The big disappointment was not getting sliced onions. But it was $5.99 for a very good sandwich.  The good news about the corned beef: the rye bread was good (they toast it), they include mustard on both sides and some decent swiss cheese. There is also a lot of meat; they order the Vienna brand.  The hitch is that Vienna corned beef is fairly dismal stuff. it's fatty and Vienna doesn't know how to slice corned beef, so the sandwich is chewy. I would buy a pound of it from this store so I could re-grind it to make corned beef hash with. I would not eat it in sandwiches.  And, yes, you can buy all their sandwich meats by the pound-- including the gyro meat. Being able to buy a pound of cooked gyro meat is, in and of itself, a reason to come back here.   I haven't tried the deli sandwiches, so I can't say. It looks like they buy pretty good product, so I'd be confident. (I don't know where they get their chicken breasts or their cheesesteak beef. I'll try them next trip, and see how that goes)  Other notes: They drive over to get doughnuts from Spudnits every day. Kudos for that. Since they're across the street from a Becker's Doughnuts, it's not a big selling point.  Unless Becker's is closed. Here is a big selling point. they're open late-- 11 most nights, midnight some. (Another reason not to eat at Taco Hell.) Also, the people working here are incredibly cheerful and friendly. They genuinely want to make customers happy and get you to come back. You can have whatever you want any way you want.  The charm is infectious. How can you not like a place that is so eager to please customers that it mentions-- on the deli menu-- that they also sell high end-cigars and live bait?  Don't get me wrong. If you live in Willoughby or Eastlake, DO NOT drive over here to try anything but the hummus. But these guys are 15 minutes away from my house, they got two things I would definitely buy (gyro and hummus) and I'd be willing to bet they make a better sandwich than Subway. And they just bought a fryer, so you'll probably be able to get fries with your order soon (Right now, the sides are limited to chips.)  As John Bloom used to say at the end of his movie reviews, \"Joe Bob says, check this sucker out.\""}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall place that I'm GLAD I found. Friendly & hard working staff.  The hours are great. They open early and close late. Great hangover cure food. Usually I think twice about gas station food but this place is on the H.N.L.!! A Whole Nother LEVEL!!! Food is made to order and the Vegetables are FRESH!!! The portions are HUGE for the price. For example the Reg. Gyro is $6.99 and that bad boy has some weight to it and will FILL YOU UP!!! Their Philly Cheese Steaks are the BOMB too!! Another thing to point out is they use the HEAVY DUTY to go boxes by Hefty that won't break on you like those damn Dixie ones. If you put one of their Gyros in a Dixie box it would fall right through the bottom because there is so much MEAT!!!!!' & FLAVAUGH!! in those Gyros. All in all I give this place a 5 Star so head on down to Sunoco cafe and Get YOU some!! YOU'll BE GLAD YA DID!!!!!"}
{"text":"Heard about this fantastic hummus at a gas station in Olmsted Falls. Looked on-line and noticed a local news station did a visit to it. Also caught all the wonderful reviews on Yelp! so decided to check it out. This was a few weeks ago and I've been averaging 2-3 visits per week.  Yes, the hummus is truly that good. I've never been a huge hummus fan, but this product got me. It truly is that good. Tried roasted red pepper, spicy, jalepeno and dill pickle - all fantastic.  Have to get the warm chopped up pita bread. The seasoning is fantastic - other posters say zatar, oregano and garlic powder. OK - I got brushed on olive oil with oregano and something else.  Today I was lucky - they had baba. I was told it is available less frequently as it has a lower shelf life to it. It too, like the hummus, was fantastic.  Today, I ordered an Italian Sub as I've seen these made for others.  It was a work of art and tasted delicious.  From the case, it looks like the meats are from Shaker Valley Foods. I'm sure this sub is not the best thing for you health-wise, but it was very, very tasty and I would recommend it.  All the hype is worth it! Get there fast!"}
{"text":"Seriously great abs and gyros. Also, the hummus is no joke - homemade and delicious. Can't say enough good things about this food to go. Owners are super friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back.  Had the Italian and wife had a gyro. Shared some onion rings and poppers. All very good."}
{"text":"Wow! Not what you'd expect at a gas station. Amazing hummus and pita, subs are huge and delicious. They have great cheese sticks, gyros...I haven't gotten anything bad here. (Side note, it's not that we don't get out a lot, we used to live downtown and frequented all the top spots. It really is delicious!) Bonus that the people that work there are SUPER friendly. Plus they use Uber Eats. Win win!"}
{"text":"This place deserves ten stars.   I drove from Westlake to this little gas station to try the hummus that everyone raves about. I got the garlic hummus and the beef bacon hummus with warmed seasoned pita. The hummus was incredible. I mean truly mind blowing: perfectly seasoned, slightly spicy, topped with premium olive oil, and the texture was just right - creamy and delicious. I could probably eat this hummus by the spoonful without pita to be honest. The owner's wife makes these amazing hummus creations in several unique flavors: pomegranate, pickle, and cranberry were all on the menu.    Not only was this hummus the best I've ever had in my life, but the customer service was phenomenal. The gentlemen working at the counter and register were friendly and ready to answer any questions I had. I truly loved the experience of going to this little Sunoco and will DEFINITELY be returning when I crave some hummus!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious hummus! I live in Brunswick and will drive the 27 minutes out of my way just to pick this up. Love the Bacon and Red Pepper Hummus. The pita bread is amazing as well! Need to order multiple orders. One is not enough. Great gas station food."}
{"text":"don't order with uber eats..90% of your order won't show up and you'll still be charged delivery fee"}
{"text":"This gas station has gained a lot of popularity lately due to a post in a foodies group on Facebook and an article written in the news. Apparently they sell some awesome homemade hummus so I decided to check them out for myself.   When I stopped in there were two young men working who were friendly and helpful (their aunt makes the hummus). Only four flavors were available: Plain, Garlic, Roasted Red Pepper, and Spicy. When fully stocked they have other flavors like Bacon, Pomegranate, Jalape√±o and Baba Ganoush. I think it's $3.99 each and sides of seasoned and grilled pita bread are only $1. I went with garlic, roasted red pepper, and a gyro. The guys threw in a side of pita since it was my first visit.   So while I am a fan of garlic, I did not enjoy the garlic hummus. It was so potent that it stung my taste buds. Just too overpowering. The roasted red pepper was really good though. Now these do come with a thick layer of olive oil on top. With olive oil I think a little goes a long way so I did pour the oil off of the hummus, just too much for me. The pita bread was good and I liked the gyro. Too often I encounter dry overly salty gryos, but that was not the case here. A ton of meat though!   Overall, I am not a fan of the potent garlic nor the excessive olive oil, but I would come back to try the other flavors of hummus! Plus friendly staff and you can fill up on gas while there!"}
{"text":"Can't miss at this place. Don't let the gas station fool you. The sandwiches are huge. And the hummus is amazing!"}
{"text":"A regular looking gas station on the outside. An amazing hummus purveyor on the inside. This is not your average gas station!  Homemade hummus is the star of the show. The freshness and texture can't be beat. Plus, they offer really interesting flavors that will change your opinions of this mediteranean treat. Pomegranate, dill pickle, jalepeno and roasted red pepper are my favorites. Baby ganoush is also available sometimes. Make sure you get the hot pita that is dusted with za'tar seasoning.  In addition to hummus, they also make delcious sandwiches and gyros.  The store is clean and the staff is really friendly. Definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Always friendly and they have the best hummus in town. I think the mom makes it and it's worth the drive for sure. I like the spicy hummus and the roasted red pepper and jalape√±o are good too but I've heard really good things about the pomegranate and the pineapple. They serve it with this thick naan like bread, warmed up and covered in olive oil and spices. The perfect compliment."}
{"text":"I stop here at least once a week to get hummus for lunch! This is the best hummus I have ever had in my life and their sandwiches are amazing as well. The only complaint I have is that way too many people know about my secret hummus place and it's soooo busy, but that's always a good sign.  :-)"}
{"text":"First time making the drive to get the famous hummus. Worth it all day. Gyro looked awesome too but didn't purchase one. Guy working also helped me make few choices on flavors and all turned out to be very good. Better than any fast food joint"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about the gyros at this gas station that I decided to give them a try. They were okay, but in my opinion not worth all of the hype. Maybe 4 stars for a gas station gyro, but 2 when compared to other local establishments.   They did have other middle eastern food that looked good. The gentleman explained that his family makes everything from scratch."}
{"text":"All I can say is, holy flavor!  Garlic hummus with seasoned pita, chicken gyro, and lamb gyro were all wonderful. Service was also great with very polite and friendly staff.  I ordered takeout and when I arrived my food was ready but the store was so busy, all waiting to get something similar to what I had.  This is going to be a monthly treat for sure!"}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving! It's a gas station, I thought gross gas station food, but no! Not here! There is a variety of of hummus I've never experienced before! All home made. We got 5 varieties of hummus, all better than the next. My favorites were the roasted garlic, original and roasted red pepper. The red pepper hummus has a smoky flavor almost like a bacon taste! So good! We also tried jalape√±o and pomegranate. We ordered gyros and the  tzatziki sauce was awesome! My only complaint (if you will!) is there's a lot of oil on the hummus and I don't think it's olive oil. It tastes more like a canola or vegetable oil. But that didn't stop me from eating it. I just poured the oil off the top."}
{"text":"I've made the trek several times now for the hummus.  It's worth it every time.  Best hummus in town.  Hands down.  This is clearly a family run place.  Every time I've encountered a couple young gentelmen working or their older counterparts.  Likely parents, Aunt, Unlcle, etc.  I stopped in a couple days ago and ordered a hummus tray.  I could get any flavors I wanted.  I ordered regular, garlic, and roasted red pepper.    When I picked it up I also had to pay for the pita bread.  I bought 2 bags to make sure we wouldn't run out.  They gave me the oil and seasonings on the side and told me how to prepare the bread before serving.  They didn't want to do it at the moment since the bread turns hard after it sits a while.  I followed their instructions and the pita is as good or better as the hummus.  After heating you drizzle olive oil, garlic powder, oregano, and za'atar.  It's delicious.  The pita is tender and so good with the seasonings.  The hummus comes with a layer of oil on top.  I just stir it in.  It doesn't bother me at all.  Especially how good this stuff tastes.  The regular comes with garbonzo beans on top.  It's rich and creamy.  Seasoning is perfect.  Garlic has roasted garlic on top.  It's garlic hummus on steroids.  It's very strong.  I like strong garlic flavor and this fits the bill.  It almost has a garlic burn to it.  I love that.  The roasted red pepper has an almost smoked taste to it.  Each is unique.  Delicious.  I have had their jalapeno and spicy before and they are very spicy.  Great if you like spicy.  I can't stop getting this stuff and won't stop.  A couple times I've been in someone has been buying a sandwich and each time they rave how good the sandwiches are.  These guys are legit."}
{"text":"Best. Hummus. Ever. But, there's so much more to make this a true hidden gem. Or, not so hidden now that every news channel in town has reported on their amazing hummus. The gyros and corned beef is on par with any deli in Cleveland, as well.   Make sure you get warm pita with the hummus."}
