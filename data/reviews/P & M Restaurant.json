{"text":"Found this place through Yelp.  A wonderful Greek diner, with great food and massive portions. I had the souvlaki on Greek salad and a side of Greek fries.  Both were delicious and I hated to leave about 1/2 behind but was stuffed.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Biggest Best burgers!!!! Everything is always amazing!!!!!! fresh food!!!!"}
{"text":"We can't get enough of this place, we go about once a week. All day breakfast (pancake the size of a dinner plate), housemade slouvaki, housemade soups, housemade Greek dressing, fish n chips handmade in front of you - you get the idea. They bend over backwards to serve you. Like visiting your favourite relatives (and not lifting a finger - ha!) Have always made me and my young son feel very welcome."}
{"text":"You must try this place. (They are moving mid-2014 to larger place, call ahead) For me, when I visited for a late lunch, my experience and hospitality of Miss Mary at this place is even greater than the top quality food.  Is a beautiful experience that cannot be found at chains. Had Gyro Dinner that included a Greek salad. I skipped breakfast at my hotel so thought I could finish; no way. The Gyro alone would have been enough.  Great food. Better people. Quirky space. Priceless."}
{"text":"Greeted by the warmest lady at the front who came around to give me a menu when I asked for takeout. She didn't rush me while I was choosing and ended up with fish & chips (~$14) and a gyros on a pita (~$7). I waited maybe 10 mins, but was surprised to see one of the cooks hand me the freshly prepared food at the front, who was also friendly. 

I didn't see how the fish and chips looked, but the proportion of meat inside the pita was more than expected! I wish I had the chance to eat inside the restaurant, maybe next time!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to his place my whole life. I remember the original founder of he restaurant. Food is pretty great I gotta say, portions are very big, you'll definitely be full. As for the service this place is not good at all, I usually do pick up, and even then these people manage to be rude. I don't know why, but service is horrible."}
{"text":"Horrible experience with my waitress. We arrived and were seated at our table. Our waitress introduced herself as Tracy. She was very unamused, and looked angry the whole time we dealt with her. She gave my wife dirty looks and said she \"asks too many questions\" when we asked when our food would come she said \"it will come when it comes stop asking questions.\" I asked to speak to a manager or owner but was told off. 
We will never be coming here again."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. It's a family ran restaurant. They have all  day breakfast and great greek food. By far the best halibut fish n chips I have ever had. They're calamari is prettty good too. Everything is homemade and delicious. It is a small place seats about 25 people. But it is worth the wait. They give monstrous portions and charge barely anything. They are also the most friendly people. Supper welcoming, supper sweet, and just great all around. I have nothing bad to say about this place.

It isn't very aesthetically pleasing, but I go for the good food and service, not what kind of decor they have."}
{"text":"Small place they are moving soon to a bigger location .. The portions are huge ..I mean HUGE the grilled chicken Greek salad was huge and I got the chicken souvlaki on a pita..soo filling.. Although I did not like the calamari ..it was just too small..little rings and to much breading.. But they said when they move to the new location they will switch it up"}
{"text":"WoW.

If you want amazing breakfast & to notch service with a family atmosphere, then you have to find this hole in the wall and give it a go.

We drove from Thornhill just to eat here & in the summer time you can then go to the farmers market across the street.

Well worth it!"}
{"text":"The food is great and reasonably priced. On your second visit people will start to recognize you and will remember your preferences. Friendly and quick service, nice people, reasonable prices. 

Breakfast is great. Homeburger combo is a great deal at $6. Greek fare is awesome. Fish ands chips is, ironically enough, better than Sun Crisp Fish and Chips just down the road. 

The only downside to this place is that if you eat here too often, you'll die. That and the seating is limited and very close quarters."}
{"text":"New location is a much needed upgrade from the old location. Solid food with great portion sizes."}
{"text":"Let me say right now - this is no health food place. If you're looking for small servings, go elsewhere. If you want huge greek salads, gigantic succulent fish with fresh cut fries, a hungry man's break fast, or other hangover curing fare, then head here if you can make it. 
  It's a tiny place, and it is not meant to be chic and stylish, and it shows. Disregard any appearance. P And M offers a good range for all age groups, and I have never been unhappy there, and I've been several times. Worth it, if you can find a seat."}
{"text":"OK FOLKS THIS IS IT! Awesome breakfast joint!

I found this place through yelp as I am the go to person for restaurants at work now as always ;) So I took them here for a massive, juicy and great breakfast.

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted at the door and the lady was very nice and friendly as she sat us down. There lunch menu is totally different then their breakfast but you can get breakfast all day I think. Thing to note would be that you would pay extra $1.99 for time 2 to 5 PM for the breakfast menu. Their prices are decent for the portions and quality they provide.

I order their Mediterranean Omelette which was made with 4 eggs, fried tomatoes, spinach and feta cheese... I was worried about the feta as some place out too much of that and then the not the best. But here all the ingredients were the right portions and mixed very well together. The omelette was huge and very tasty.  The Omelette comes with potatoes which were done nicely; you will also get toast and coffee/tea with the same meal. All this for $13 to $15 before taxes.

The service was slendid and quick. Entire team working at the restaurant was very nice and multiple people asked us if we enjoyed and if the food was nice, some of them were chefs. The restaurant was clean.

Overall very good place to have a nice big breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"Have enjoyed this breakfast  place for years, my children & I. 
Location 4/5: it's in a nice central area at Weston Rd & Lawrence Ave W. Parking is accessible (in the grocery parking lot that's connected with this restaurant) & it's free, if you park on the street there are parking meters available at cost of course. Wheelchair accessible & also accessible by public transit.  This is a very clean, comfortable, diverse & nice family owned restaurant & they're always very appreciative of your business!

Cost 3.5/5: It's affordable,  but not as low cost as other places that offers Breakfast Specials! So you're looking at the least cost for a meal being $$. 

Food/Beverages 4/5:  Very delicious food...never a complaint! Alcoholic drinks are also available. Milkshakes too!!!

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!

Take out & eat in available."}
{"text":"So I found this place by fluke simply by googling \"best breakfast places in toronto\"...google did not let me down that is for sure. 

I can honestly say I am a regular here now. Reason being is the breakfast is great, but i LOVE LOVE LOVE the service. My mom and I always leave feeling so positive because of how friendly the staff is. Not only do they recognize us every time but they always make us feel like a VIP. You can feel the family vibe and the quality of the food. It is not some fine dining snobby brunch place, but it is humble and always hits the spot.

I am so happppppy I have this place to go to considering I am a huge breakfast fan."}
{"text":"Portions are legit

Service Got dam, ladies remind me of my grandmother. Bare sweethearts

Only thing that may bother you is the size. It's really small. Mostly cuz homies gettin takeout but still. GOAT"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for breakfast. We did not know what to expect, but we knew that this was a highly rated restaurant. 

This place is definitely the best value for money breakfast in town. The omelettes can easily be eaten for breakfast and lunch. The staff are extremely  hospitable.

The seating area is a little small but they will be moving to a new location just up the street in a weeks time. The place has a loyal local clientele. A really neighbourhood institution in Weston."}
{"text":"The food was good and the size was larger than I expected.
The restaurant looked new; Table, chair, floor...everything was clean.

It is a good place to have meal with your family and friends."}
{"text":"Yummy.. Had the turkey club with fries it's so huge u have to eat it sideways lol fries were fresh and crispy and the gravey was great also not watery.. Food was done within 10 minutes got my son the chicken strip meal he thought it was better then montanas and to hear that from a 8 year old that means it's friggin Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"The old location the new location doesn't matter they didn't miss a beat when they moved to the new place. The food is fantastic the service is good welcoming and friendly. Absolutely no complaints buddy had his \"standard breakfast\" of a pemeal sandwich, he said it was the best he has ever had. I had eggs and sausage it was just as good as it always is. Honestly is affordable extremely affordable. The coffee is great quality the place is clean the food is hot and fresh.

If you are anywhere near the neighborhood you should seek this place out. Once a small hole in the wall its now a great place with great food. The staff likes to crack jokes with the patrons and with each other you feel like you are in a place with people who love what they do and take incredible pride. It's a breakfast try it you can't go wrong !"}
{"text":"Came here because of the stars and the reviews (because even if what I want is simple I still want the best). I wasn't planning on writing a review here because all I wanted was a simple Greek Salad with Souvkaki and that generally isn't hard to screw up. But oh my!!!! This salad was fantastic the Souvlaki (Pork) was so juicy and tender and the portion size was phenomenal. Keep note it isn't cheap if you're looking for cheap and fast it's a restaurant not a fast food joint. I will definitely come here again and now I need to try out their breakfast."}
{"text":"Greek salad was delicious. Gyro was fantastic (huge portions) and the service was on point. Made us feel so welcome and at home. Will be back."}
{"text":"We went for late lunch the other day and really enjoyed our time. My aunt (who is the one who recommended we go) normally orders take out with her school, so it was all of ours first time dining in the restaurant. Going in on a Wednesday, they told us as we came in that it was Greek day and that you would get a free baklava if you ordered any of the Greek dinners. As soon as we were seated out drink orders were taken and we were able to check out the menus. I knew I wanted Greek so I ended up going with the Gyro dinner. My brother ordered the Ringer burger and my aunt the Gyro pita. We also ordered calamari and onion rings. The onion rings are insanely huge and super crispy, although I think they could have used a bit more flavour in the batter (salt or something)! The calamari was alright, but nothing incredibly special. I received a Greek salad with my dinner, which came pretty quickly. It was very big considering it was just a side, and filled with lots of fresh veggies and LOTS of feta cheese! It was delicious. Our meals came pretty quickly and you can't go wrong with the portion sizes. Everything was huge. The burger had four of their massive onion rings on it, and was as big as my brothers head. The Gyro dinner comes with lots of gyro, a grilled pita and lots of rice and potatoes. The gyro pita was also huge, filled with lots of fresh veggies and tzatziki. Overall, huge portions, tasty food, excellent prices and super quick service. Would highly recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today for the first time, in the original location (they're moving in May to a new and much bigger place  a couple of storefronts further south).  Service is super attentive and very welcoming, and the food is great.  Fresh cut fries always get my vote,  i had an excellent gyros wrap; one son had a cheeseburger; and my wife and youngest son shared halibut & chips.  Highly recommended for the food, friendliness, and value."}
{"text":"Finally made it to the new location.  WOW!!  It's a great place. Love it and the food and staff are still as lovely as ever!!!  Get get there more often."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! Very friendly staff, large portions and not too expensive. 

I tried the chicken souvlaki dinner with rice, garlic bread, potatoes and salad. My favourite was the rice. I also checked out their breakfast menu and plan on trying it one day. 

You will not be disappointed coming here for a meal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant on the west side of Toronto. Delicious greek food, reasonable price and with always amazing service!"}
{"text":"Wow size portions vs prices! 

Great prices for those behemoth sized plates.

Been there twice now during a week day lunch. 

Got the souvlaki on a pita twice and had left overs twice!

Tried their fries, perogies, Caesar salad and chicken tenders today. 

Everything was delicious and flavorful. 

Nothing beats a great deal except great service and they have it too! Mary had our table today and she was friendly but informative with a homey feel to her service! Pay at cash when youre done and be ready to have left overs or share!

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Favourite Greek spot in the city, gem in the area, the calamari is the best food option, so crispy and tastes amazing. Owned by a very sweet family, I've been coming ever since I moved into the Weston road area 10 years ago, their portions are quite generous."}
{"text":"Always fast, fresh and delicious food. I took a coworker here and they were impressed a hidden gem in Weston - great job guys! 
Also their prices are reasonable EDIT nvm y'all are trash"}
{"text":"New location rocks!  Went in for breakfast and the food was amazing. Service was exceptional. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Went in to the resturaunt to have breakfast the other day with my fiancée. We both had the waffle combo, a nice fresh Belgium waffle, sausage and 3 eggs and coffee. Was a amazing experience, friendly staff and very clean. Prices were amazing as well. I will be sure to be coming here more often. Thank you."}
{"text":"Food was huge!  Food was okay, though the kids chicken was a bit burnt.  Server wasn't too friendly and made us feel a little unwelcome.  But nice ambiance and culture."}
{"text":"This place is a gem.

It's a cozy little place so usually you have to fight your way through a line up of people ordering take out which you may end up joining when you find there's no seating.

So if you plan on eating P&M make it a take out affair and you should call ahead.

So the guy behind the counter is a little sharp and abrasive, that's because he's trying to make everyone happy, he works in a tough little neighborhood near a school so he keeps it nice and serious and fast, he's not taking his time to get to you, he knows at any second a group of 4 people will be walking in behind you.

Alright so the food. Remember when people made things with care and pride? They still do that at P&M. I mean you can see other reviewers here talking about portions at this place. They're right, you get a box of fries with your meal, not a little scoop thing. It's one of those rectangular cardboard boxes that fish and chips places usually use.

So what about quality?

One of the best gyros in the city. They don't cheap out on the meat either, they layer it on nice and high.

Hamburgers, they're the home burger style, nice and big and with that charbroil flavor that places like Burger King wish they had. It's a Greek place so all the food is named stuff like the \"Zeus Burger\" or \"The Hercules Burger\". The Zeus burger is an 8oz burger topped with lettuce, onions, tomato, tzatziki and feta cheese ($6.75) so they offer a nice twist on a burger you can't get at most places.

The Fish and Chips are great, they give you two nice big pieces of fish, the place is packed with people during religious days that require you to eat fish.

The gravy is wicked, it's got a little bit of that sweetness like they add cinnamon to it or something, I always get the gravy and poor it all over my fries, it's so choice.

It's the kind of place that feels like if they're making the food the way they'd be making for themselves. Nice and simple served at portions they'd probably serve their kids without cutting any corners, they do the classics here and they do them dead on.

I've taken all my friends there and any time they visit and we're having dinner they always want to go there."}
{"text":"Food was well made,  but make sure you know ahead the average plate is huge,  so two persons can share..  Good food."}
{"text":"The service was super friendly and felt like home. They are expanding not far from current location, can't wait to check it out when they open!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite breakfast restaurants! Great food and quality. The owners are also so nice, it's refreshing!"}
{"text":"P & M's has moved from 1972 Weston Road to 1946 Weston Road as of May 5, 2015. Yelp please update business listing. New location further south is twice the size & newly renovated with ground floor washrooms & big screen TV over the bar. You won't be disappointed with the generous servings & great service at this long time family run Greek diner restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is downright amazing. The atmosphere is great, it's so welcoming, upbeat and relaxing. Perfect for everyone :) the service is fast and friendly 
The staff is kind, friendly and polite.  Best service ever.
I definitely recommend you give it a try. You won't leave hungry with the very generous portions :)"}
{"text":"Very average place with very mediocre food. 

The staff is really friendly, which was a nice way to be welcomed and catered to. We ordered the halibut (grilled) salad and the halibut fish and chips. 

The food arrived quickly. My grilled halibut was very thin and looked overcooked. One bite of the fish verified that. The fish and chips were decent- the batter was very crispy, light, and well seasoned- but the fish was bland and overcooked. The fries were drenched in oil, which made the meal difficult to eat and gave us stomach pains.

I probably wouldn't come here again. There are several food options in the area (not the greatest ones, I know) and this is nothing special. Perhaps their Greek food is better? I'll never know."}
{"text":"Clean and average service. Bland food and even blander hospital style presentation. Not great value either."}
{"text":"First time going to this spot. Amazing service & very healthy portions! I love that its a very small vicinity with about 4-5 tables- real mom n pop shop sort of feel! P. S bottomless coffee with breakfast!"}
