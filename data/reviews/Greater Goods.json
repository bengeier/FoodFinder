{"text":"A cool small business opened across the street from where I work. It's primarily a tea bar with consignment local goods, but it's also a place for painting / crafting workshops. The \"goods\" range from bath bombs to mismatched socks to handmade jewelry and soap and  cards. I have no idea what dry shampoo is, but they have it. 

The tea is pretty fantastic. They're also bringing coffee in starting tomorrow, so I can't wait for that. The space is bright and open and I love the very high ceilings. Both times I've been their the staff have been pleasant and helpful. Especially when I say, \"what's this?\" Or \"what is this supposed to smell like?\" (Not all the soaps are as fragrant as they look.)"}
{"text":"I am new to Calgary and got lost looking for an office building on Meredith.  I stopped by Greater Goods to ask for directions.  The girl who was working was extremely kind, and went above and beyond in helping me find my way.  She consulted Google maps, looked up the website of the office I was looking for, and told me if I still couldn't find it, to come back so that she could try again.  I was extremely touched by her generosity.

I had an appointment to keep so I could not browse, but upon first impression, the shop was very clean and filled with many interesting and cute items - perfect for gifts.  The cafe area was also very clean and looked like a beautiful place to spend some time in.  I'm hoping that once I get settled, I can return and look at all of the neat things in the store."}
{"text":"Greater Goods is an excellent collection of local vendors and makers goods, perfect if you're looking for a gift for somebody. They have a great collection of cards and items but they also have treats from Pretty Sweet, tea and popsicles so be sure to treat yourself when you're there. The building is adorable just note that the parking lot on the side is all reserved for Whitehall so I don't use it when visiting Greater Goods because I don't want a ticket."}
