{"text":"This was the second time I ordered food from here hoping my second experience would be better than the first. Sadly i was disappointed again. Raw potatoes in the 'Aloo Gobi' watered down 'Palak Paneer' and rubberized 'Naans'  I called up the restaurant to let then know that I was disappointed with the food but the guy at the other end refused to believe me. Argued back that it was my opinion and the Aloo gobi is the hottest selling item. Raw potatoes are not a matter of opinion.  Never going back there again."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite take out restaurants in the neighborhood. The owners are very friendly, the food is always fresh and for the amount of food you get in a dinner combo the price is fairly reasonable.  When it comes to variety, you have a good selection of meat and vegetarian dishes.  Overall I would give Jaipur express 4 stars for authenticity, freshness and friendliness."}
{"text":"Jaipur Express is a takeout location next to Rabbas grocery. It opened up this past summer 2010. (they have a sit down restaurant location in Markham)  I had first tried this downtown location's food at one of the cultural events in the summer time at Harbourfront Centre. I ordered then a meal combo of channa masala (chick pea) curry, rice,  butter chicken and pita. Not impressed by the taste to tell you frankly. So I wrote this place off and wasn't going to try it again.  Today though I was craving some Indian food and convinced my fiancee let's give this place another shot.I called them up in advance for pickup. I ordered a dinner for two special. $19.95 you get raita, 2 naan, 2 samosas, 1 meat dish, 1 vegetable dish, and 1 dessert.  Not bad. Walking inside the place has some bar stools in the front portion of the restaurant where one or a small group of 4 can have a quick meal if you wanted, but the place is sparsely decorated so it's not a place where one would want to take a date. :)For our vegetable dish option we got the alo gobi (cauliflower) and the meat dish retry of the butter chicken.We were greeted with very friendly service. As we were waiting for a samosa to finish cooking we talked with the restaurant owner and had an interesting conversation about love and cuisine . but anyways that another story all together.. lol .   We briskly walked back in the cold wintry weather and brought the food home. Immediately we laid everything out on the table, cracked out the plates, serving spoons and tried it all out. Started with the chicken samosas, a little bit on the greasy side as they fell out of the from the bottom paper bag! :o haha no need to reach from the top. Wow these samosas were good, tasted like lumpia shanghai (a Filipino spring roll with meat) but in triangular form. Came with tamarind sauce on the side. Nice touch.Alo gobi had a nice flavour, same with the butter chicken it was filled with large fresh chucks of chicken cooked in the sauce. Not too creamy not too sweet either. The naan, looks like the presidents choice brand I've had before. I'm serious. This was not made fresh from a clay oven.. here at least. :pThe rice, had a nice touch shaved carrot . Different and done proper. Moist not over done.Containers I wished were foam to retain a little more heat.   Overall a good experience, not culinary perfection but I didn't have those high expectations going in. It actually was a lot better than I imagined and a lot better when I tried it from the summer time at Harbourfront.Not a bad choice if I needed to grab some Indian food around the area."}
{"text":"Your basic Indian food.  Compared to some places, I also agree that the food was bland.  But, I still really enjoyed it.  The Naan was good.  Service was very very slow and the place was not busy."}
{"text":"I love their Roti, in my opinion better than Best rated roti downtown on queen and bathurst"}
{"text":"Next time someone calls to ask if the order - which was already an hour late, and which I gave the reference number for - was on it's way and had been picked up by the Just Eats delivery, please don't lie just to get me off the phone.  I understand that Just Eats is pretty unreliable and won't be using them again, but if you valued your customers, you would have told me the truth."}
{"text":"I was craving Indian food, and this is right across the street from my hotel. I ordered the two combo meal with channa marsala, chicken balti marsala, rice, and naan.  I was so disappointed. There was spice to the dishes, but they were bland. The naan was stale.  They were speedy when it came to service, but I will not eat here again."}
