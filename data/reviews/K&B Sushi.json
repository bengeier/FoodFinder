{"text":"The air conditioning in this restaurant was set so low that I got sick from eating here. Ordered a soup to warm me up but it never came. Some dishes were luke warm. Mentioned that the restaurant was too cold to the wait staff several times, they just smiled and went about their business. I think they may do this so you feel uncomfortable and leave quicker. Food was good though and it came quickly."}
{"text":"Disgusting!  Avoid!  Unless you enjoy a roach in your cup of water.  Told the waiter and he took the glass away and brought us back another cup of water."}
{"text":"I am impressed by the selection and quality of the sushi, appetizers and entr√©es on the menu. I chose the buffet option, which is not cheap but not overpriced. If you have an appetizer and two rolls elsewhere, you'd spend about the same. 

The sashimi is quality meat, sliced thicker than I'm used to but excellent none the less.

The rolls are smaller than I'm used to but given the buffet nature of the establishment I appreciated it in the end.

The tempura was tasty and warm but not hot.

The appetizers were quite good. Only misstep was the bacon wrapped mushrooms. Too fatty, not crispy and a large size. Didn't enjoy that, but wasn't enough to make it lose a star.

I would recommend definitely."}
{"text":"Since my previous review was deleted - I decided to write another review about this establishment.  FYI K&B requesting the deletion of user complaints instead of addressing concerns speaks volumes for your management and customer service style. 

I used to frequent this restaurant, prices are good and the food was good and consistent for all you can eat sushi.  My complaints however are as follows: 

1. My friend who I was dining with has a serious allergy to cucumber.  While we all told the server numerous times that no food could have cucumber in it because of an allergy she was still served an avocado hand roll made with cucumber.  
While she was dealing with her reaction, I called the manager over to explain what had happened and to request our bill.  Instead of apologizing and promptly bringing our bill to us the manager began to argue with us. First he said there was no cucumber in the food; I dissected to roll and showed him that there was in fact cucumber.  Then, he argued we had not told them there was an allergy.  He continued to argue with us for some time - called our server aside, spoke with her privately and returned to argue with us again.  At this point I wanted to settle whatever bill he felt was appropriate and get my friend home where she could get her medication.  He then finally proceeded to present me with a bill for the total value of or meals - including a bill for my friend who they had just served cucumber to.   

2. Within 45 minutes of leaving this restaurant (which was my first meal of the day) I became doubled over in stomach pain - I won't go into details but I have never been so sick to my stomach in all my life (this includes visiting Mexico City and eating local cuisine, I don't have a weak stomach).  

All in all the price of this restaurant is fantastic and bang for your buck - it's not bad but to put things into perspective I used to visit this restaurant approx. 3 times a week and have not returned since this experience which was months ago."}
{"text":"Rude staff and horrible service.  Food was average.  ipad ordering was terrible and sometimes wouldn't come, or double up everything.  In the end, there was too much food and they charged us for the excess (that was due to the error with their machine).  Stay away!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Food, Easy to order on the iPad menu, good service. It has become one of my favourite places to go. AYCE Lunch is a very good price for what you can eat."}
{"text":"Today we decided to try new all you can eat sushi place a friend recommended. We called to book for a reservation and they said just come by there are plenty of tables available but when we arrived we have to wait 30 mins to be seated. Interior design was warm and modern. The food presentation were nice but not as good as it looks. Sushi rolls were alright. Sashimi were not good at all have to give only two stars cause it was previous frozen not fresh. I have very difficult time chugged down cause do not want to waste the food. Love Sashimi all my life but after this I will have to say no to all you can eat places for a long time..."}
{"text":"I went to this location for the lunch buffet. The location in general is very well setup. They say my friend and I at a very lonesome side table near a door. The staff was fast, yet not very welcoming. The food is well prepared but not something that makes you go crazy for it. Mediocrely good"}
{"text":"Would give it a 0 if I could.  From the gentleman (I use the term very loosely) who greeted us to the total disorganization of the servers/staff.  They have no clue how to operate a restaurant. Better to go down the street to the Spoon and Fork and get better food and service.   HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE stay away."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Solid asian food for the price. Everything on the menu comes to the table better than expected for a chain-looking establishment. Portions are good even for tapas-style buffet, but what keeps me from giving them a full five stars is that they ignored us for about 5 minutes when we came in. After that, it was all good."}
{"text":"The waiter who works there was openly rude and condescending for no reason other than he clearly hates his job. We ordered our food and made the mistake of *gasp* not angling the order screen directly into his line of vision. He came over to chastise us and basically called us idiots. I very politely explained that it was a mistake and he responded with something alone the lines of \"yeah, it's called technology\". I'm never going back there again even though I live in the neighborhood. There is a way better sushi place up the street. 
By the way, he did this in front of my elderly mother celebrating her Birthday. Classy."}
{"text":"We visited here for the first time today for lunch. We were quite impressed by the selection of items. The food was delicious and better than Spoon and Fork which we normally dine at. The sushi was fine but the cooked Japanese and Chinese food items were really good. Favourite picks among the group were the beef short ribs, garlic beef, cheese wontons and fried rice. I am quite surprised that this place got so many negative reviews. It may be hit and miss, but we found our visit to be quite pleasant. Service was quick, food was great, and place was clean!"}
{"text":"Went today to celebrate my my daughter's 16th birthday.  It was her choice as she came here a year ago for one of her friend's birthday. 

Party of 5.  All you can eat.  It took over 10 minutes after we got our table to get the tablets.  You place your order on a tablet rhey gave you and when done hit a bottom to send it in.  The server comes checks it up and goes. 

Good start.  Food started coming ay a steady pace at first but shortly after started coming notoriously more spaced out.  Some of the items where great and others like  the brocoli salad tasted awful and stale. 

Servers work almost in a robotic manner.   Perhaps because the place was busy.  I was surprised that was the case for a Monday evening.   

Cleanliness: this is one area where they lack good service.   The ladies washroom was filthy and one of the 3 toilets was overflowing, leaving only 2 available.  

Service: several random waiters attend the same table so some where kind some where more stoic. 

Food: I would give it a 3 star for then freshness and quality and a 4 star for variety as there are a lot of choices on the menu.   

Prices: Alcoholic beverages were priced right.   All you can eat dinnet $25 p/p. Comparable with other sushi places in Oakville. If you pay cash you get 10% off the bill.

Facilities: Decor is modern, spacious and with booth type tables. Located in a nice entertainment plaza. 

Overall a nice place to come in a group.  A bit too rush and hectic feeling if you're looking for an intimate romantic dinner or quiet place to eat."}
{"text":"I like the new iPad menus. The pictures helped me make sure what I was ordering, but I miss the descriptions included in the other menus. They should add descriptions to help identify what's inside something."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. They lost my business. 
I have been going to this place since it opened at least twice a month (over a year). The wait staff recognized me every time I walked in but a smile was hard to find. And no...I am not rude or a bad tipper. 
The last time I went I found a hair in the short ribs. The manager barely apologized for this and did not offer anything. My friend and I were in a rush (yes our fault) and asked to take the food on the table. We had 4 pieces of tempura and 6 pieces of sushi left. I had to take her to the airport and we were late. I explained and apologized to the waitress who didn't understand me so I asked for the manager...the manager acknowledged that I am a regular customer when I asked him, yet still charged me a fee to take the food....After I pointed out there was hair in the food. I was very upset. As a loyal customer they had made hundreds off me and everyone I brought there and they were not willing to waive the fee. There was no apology or sense of genuity.  Needless to say I will not be going there anymore and will make sure to spread the word about how I was treated."}
{"text":"Yumm!! Is all I can say about the food. There are a ton of choices on the menu and most is made to order. The service while slow sometimes is always very good. I've had a few minor glitches, but mostly with fellow patrons and the staff were quick to respond, moving me and my companion to another table. An absolute must try: The seaweed salad or their Korean short ribs."}
{"text":"*3.5/5 stars*
Decided to try lunch here with my mom & sister. When we first arrived I noticed how nice and modern the decor was. The greeter was nice and friendly, and it wasn't too busy around 2pm. We were brought to our booth which was directly in front of the main entrance, wasn't too happy about that. Anyways we sat and was given our menu. Our server was also nice and friendly. 
I love how small the portions are so you can avoid over eating. 
Most of the things we ordered were delicious the top 3 were - the crab pizza 
-general tao's chicken 
-spicy California roll ( had a tempura batter on it and was served warm, the best one on the menu, 10/10) 

But there was some not so good ones... Don't order any of the salads with a dressing! My mom had ordered a spring salad and with the dressing on it, it was very watery at the bottom like it was made ahead and was just sitting there all day. Also the fried rice was so salty, not enjoyable at all. My mom told the server about these two items and didn't even apologize, let alone acknowledge what my mom was saying. I found that really rude and unprofessional. 
Overall, it was a nice experience and I will be returning."}
{"text":"It was very disappointed..
just ordered the regular menu since we were not hungry~~ the portion was small, and the waitress was new and did not bring the soup and salad which come with the meal~ 

order the udon soup for myself, it was very oily..it is the first time i got the oily udon soup~~ i love udon soup and i always ordered soup from very Japanese restaurant i i tried ~~ it is the worst one i had~~i did not finish my soup and went home to cook my own food..

Beef tariyaki roll was quit good~~

i willl never go back again~~"}
{"text":"KB is slightly lower quality than your average fancy iPad AYCE place like spring downtown, but still above average amongst general AYCE. Better considering the area. I ordered off the dinner menu during lunch because I wanted sashimi and it wasn't available in the lunch menu. There's a very wide selection of apps, sashimi, noodle soups, sushi rolls, dim sum, and dessert. They also have American Chinese food like general tao and fried rice if that's your thing. The iPads have pictures of the food but not descriptions so it helps to be familiar with sushi resto dishes and Japanese names.

On the actual quality the sushi is good and not over-riced. Sashimi was hit and miss. Some were a bit cold and felt like it may have been recently frozen. The scallop sashimi was especially good though (but you only get 2 pcs per person) as well as the squid and salmon. The tuna sashimi (also limited) however, was dry. How do you make raw fish dry??? The cooked meat dishes like the squid and beef were on the over cooked side. Would recommend the cold shrimp app, unagi don, mousse cakes, and bbq pork buns.

Service is prompt but very cold. Only the male waiter spoke to me at all. My first waitress had a series of strange and judgemental looks when reviewing my order. I heard another waitress loudly telling the table next to me that tips weren't included after they paid. (Shaming strategy? Idk) Fortunately due to the ipads you don't have to interact with them much and they do actually bring you your whole order."}
{"text":"Bottom line: one of the best AYCE place in GTA. 

This AYCE sushi place had its ups and downs but recently it has been trending up and stabilized.

Sashimi portion is not only generous but the quality is also great. Premium items such as Sweet shrimps, red tuna, scallops, beef tataki, octopus are all on the menu. They also come quickly too even on a busy nights. They are definitely not playing the waiting game when it comes to the sashimi and sushi department.

The cooked food department is okay in terms of variety and good on quality. Be ware when you order rice or noodle dishes as they tend to be big and will fill up your stomach quickly.

I recommend this place, perhaps best AYCE in Etobicoke/ west end Toronto."}
{"text":"Had a nice quiet, casual dinner with a work colleague who is visiting from Taiwan. He was very impressed with the food quality, as was I. Service was quick and friendly. Will be back for sure. Want to try the Oakville location next."}
{"text":"2.5/5 stars
Overall good, but some BIG faux pas! 

PROS
* The renovations they've done inside are fantastic. 
* AYCE for under $30 is a good price.
* The iPad ordering is a novel idea (with some room for improvement)
* For the most part, the food was good, and arrived fast.
* Generally, the servers were good.
* They can handle large parties - the iPad ordering makes this easy, too.

CONS
* iPad: items listed incorrectly - several of the options listed as \"vegetarian\" on the iPad menu actually had fish or meat in them -- this could have been deadly had it been an allergy and not a dietary choice! When we brought it up to the server they kind of shrugged and said sorry. FIX THE MENU!
* The \"manager\" or \"floor supervisor\" that was there was very pushy and a bit rude - he kept rearranging things on our table (moving the soy sauce to one side, moving our drinks and plates around) while we were eating. At one point he actually pushed my partners hand out of the way so he could put down a plate. 
* Some items we ordered never showed up. We ordered a mushroom tempura on our first round - it never arrived. We re-ordered it on the second round - it never arrived. We re-ordered it, just by itself as a third round, and got a plate with 3 mushrooms. 

THE ACID TEST
Will I go back? I'd give a second chance (but not a third).
Will I recommend this to my friends? Yes, hopefully their experience is better."}
{"text":"Sashimi and sushi all taste \"bland\" and not that fresh, nothing special about this place that I could think of besides the spacious free parking at the back.
They try to fancy up the place with white cloth table but the food quality including the kitchen is below average. Luckily my server was attentive at the beginning since it wasn't that busy but once more customers started to come in for dinner time my last called I didn't see my server anywhere and had to call the manager for the bill 20 mins later."}
{"text":"I didn't have high hopes when we decided to go here but I was quite pleasantly surprised.  The inside is really nice looking and the food was pretty good. Prices are comparable to most sushi places in the GTA. The service was also really good. We just ordered a la carte instead of the 30$ AYCE. I had a Yuki roll which was good but a bit too sweet for me. I wanted to try something different and I probably won't order this again. I would come back, but it's not at the top of my list."}
{"text":"So the servers and staff are really nice and good to people. The problem is it took them 2+ hours to serve my food. I went with my family and my mom is already eating dessert and I haven't even gotten any of my food I was just tasting my other family members but mine never came and the waitress told me to keep ordering over and over again, but still none of them came and I had to eat my food quickly because everyone was basically done eating but me."}
{"text":"The food is average. Decent amount and size dishes. The plates are huge and could be quite inconvenient. They do serve FAST and the do it yourself iPad ordering helps with this."}
{"text":"All you care to eat Sushi is a bad idea.  Everything was terrible.  For what it is worth, the place was packed.  I'd stay away.  ICK!"}
{"text":"Good food. Fast and friendly service. Reasonably priced. We didn't opt for the all you can eat option but we may next time. The restaurant was a nice sit-down and relax atmosphere."}
{"text":"This had one of the best tasting sushi that I have ever had. Me and my friends did not do all you can eat here but ordered from their A La Carte menu. I had the spicy crab roll and the spicy California roll and was STUFFED! It was great! I tried my friend's salmon teriyaki and it was good as well! The only thing I did not enjoy about this place was the service, we were rushed to order drinks before we could seat down! but it was a friday night and busy, so it was not surprising. The decor is lovey! I will definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"Quick and good service, sushi quality is good for all you can eat.the environment is great, collection of sushi is awsome"}
{"text":"From the moment we step-in to this restaurant, we were greeted with warm smiles and welcoming faces. The decor alone was bar none, the place was very cozy. We were very impressed by the way our food was order. Their portion sizes are awesome and very tasty. I guarantee you that you will leave this place wishing you could eat more. There's a lot of room for parking. Price was very reasonable. We would gladly recommend K & B Sushi for people who have appetite for great Sushi."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Toronto and the GTA by far. I'm a regular there, showing up EVERY Wednesday for their AYCE lunch, and every time I go there, im treated with the same excellent quality sushi and service. 

I've tried literally dozens of sushi places here and i simply refuse to eat anywhere else."}
{"text":"Don't expect great service here. I came here with friends and some things we ordered never showed up. I felt like an idiot for hyping up the place and now tell anyone I can not to go there! They need a new manager and a lesson on customer service. I hope it was just a bad day for them, but reading some of these reviews it seems not. How can you rate food that never showed up? The kicker was watching the table across from us order right away and get food before we did. Also, I noticed a server being rude to another table close by with a concern. She visibly rolled her eyes and walked away while the gentleman was still trying to talk to her! I'm honestly afraid to go back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the all you can eat lunch menu here on Saturday.  We ordered hot and sour soup, gyoza, steamed dumpling, avacado and seaweed salad as starters. The soup lacked flavor but wasn't terrible. We weren't a fan of the gyoza as it had a really strong ginger taste to it,  however the steamed dumpling and salads were delicious. 
Our next round was salmon and Butterfish sashimi with chicken skewers. They were all great choices. Sashimi was fresh and the chicken was tender. 
Our sushi was assorted we ordered from the special menu...unagi, red dragon roll and spicy salmon with something else I am forgetting.  Overall I would say this place is pretty decent considering there isn't lot of all you can eat I etobicoke. Also if you love Sapporo it was on special for 5.99 on Saturday!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service, constantly losing orders, long wait time for food, brings the bill before we are done eating, doesn't acknowledge customer complaints. 

Find another sushi restaurant, don't go here."}
{"text":"Overpriced and average food was very disappointed. No chili oil for dim sum. The iPad based ordering system doesn't work well."}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars, but we didn't enjoy the in-restaurant experience as much as we like ordering for pick up.  Compared to many other local places their food and specifically their sushimi is consistent and fresh. The portions for the sides such as edamame and avocado salad are very generous when ordering take out. 
We usually order once every month or two and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Again at this restaurant.

5 senses: 

Sight: Don't expect a smile from the waitresses here. Clean place.

Hearing: Some japanese music?

Taste: Food is good here.

Smell: hmmmm

Touch: clean tables."}
{"text":"I eat at this restaurant almost weekly but today they really bothered me. So much so that i am writing my very first restaurant review. 

Let me just start off by saying the food is truly amazing the quality is great. Especially compared to places like Mandarin or imperial which have gone extremely down hill. At k&b two can lunch (all you can eat) for $33 which again is the only reason we keep coming back. But, what really pissed me off is how much they rush you. (This happens every day) you can see the waiters and the managers get frustrated if you stop eating and socialize. And as soon as you order desert they remove everything from your table including the iPad menu. And practically expect you to leave. And this really pisses me off. Its practically impossible to eat in peace after a while."}
{"text":"It was my first time and would be the last time to this place.  The decor was average, service was bad, foods not fresh, tasted bland.  

Although we chose \"all you can eat\" and ordered very small amount, once we passed the second order, there was an attitude and some of the items never showed up. I ordered again but items were not brought to me. I was fed up and had to leave.  It was just unpleasant overall."}
{"text":"Came here for a bday and the service was garbage. I noticed our food was being delivered to the next table several times. I pointed this out to our server she told us we didn't send the orders correctly. We made one order and it was clearly on the order request. Anyways after I pointed this out our missed orders came and others too. Although our server didn't apologize for the mishap she became a bit more pleasant and attentive. It was probably when I commented on how tips work. Customers shouldn't point out how shit of a job you're doing to get service. Going to an AYCE or buffet you kind of know what to expect in terms of service. Honestly the Mandarin does a better job even though they say Welcome to Mandarin a 100 times. Customers order food on an iPad so we're doing half the job, the servers should at least do the other half of job right.

Anyways if you're looking for better service and over all sushi, Kaji (pricey) and Sushi2Go are down the street. I would never step foot in this AYCE sushi trap again!"}
{"text":"Mediocre AYCE sushi restaurant.  The service is just ok. They are not very attentive or friendly. 
The food was equivalent to the service.  Most of the sashimi was not fresh and appeared dry, so not edible.   Tried the beef short rib which was 90% fat and 10% meat.  Overall not a great dining experience and not worth the cost.  This place is no comparison to spoon and fork which is across the street."}
{"text":"Save your money and save your time! This was the ultimate worst dining experience of my life! The food was absolutely nasty! The salmon sashimi tasted old and frozen! I must say the maki is about average! The staff was extremely rude and took are cutlery away abruptly and brought our dessert. After the dessert they brought us more dishes that we has previously ordered at the beginning! Very rude and horrible food! I have not been more upset with any place as much as this crappy place in my life!"}
{"text":"This new restaurant for AYCE sushi is better than the competition in the GTA.
The service is efficient and quick.  The menu has many good items including all kinds of rolls and fish.   The appetizers and teriyaki are amazing too!
The items have great quality ingredients and are well prepared. 
I keep going back there!"}
{"text":"The service is not great while the food is okay.
The manager seems to lack basic comprehension and communication skills.
We complained several times about the heat in the restaurant, of a temp around 30 degrees.  He would only mumble some things in broken English which we didn't understand.  This was our 2nd time there and the same issue made us get up and leave sooner than we wanted to.  Maybe that's their plan. keep it hot and customers will order less food on the all you can eat price.  Well we are not going back and don't recommend the place. 
Another complaint is why there is no cold sake under 25 dollars for a small bottle. The house sake comes in only hot and they don't carry anything like bottles of \"Draft Sake\" available at almost all other sushi places.  If you operate a place purposely the temp of an oven, maybe it would be good idea to offer some cold sake."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant yesterday for the first time and I am quite impressed. The service was very prompt, food was fresh and hot, orders were accurate and I will definitely be coming back when I am in the area, usually to watch a movie at the Cineplex. Also, me and my boyfriend had the ALYCE lunch menu for $16, very decent price for the quality. I recommended trying this place at least once! Also ordering on the iPad was an extra fun bonus, very interactive."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for lunch. Was greeted by the manager and given a very thorough tutorial on how to use the iPad ordering system. Great selection of Japanese and other pan-Asian dishes. 

I had the salmon pizza which was the best thing I tried and the best sushi pizza I've ever had. They had a cool variation of yam roll which was a veggie dragon roll. 

For dessert I had my first try of deep fried milk which was delicious. $5 off coupon for liking them on Facebook didn't make too bad as the price tag for lunch is $16.99 but worth it."}
{"text":"Our experience was tough because our kids were being bad but service was efficient thank God. Sushi and other Japanese food was standard, dim sum food needed work. Mango pudding was too watery. Coconut ice cream tasted like soap. Might be back with a larger group and no kids. Bathrooms were clean. A bit pricy for what you get."}
{"text":"This place is really good. The food comes out quick, everything we ordered on the iPad came out almost at the same time! I love the sushi here. All the servers are very nice and was always there to refill our water and pop. They were also pleasantly happy to serve us and we felt very welcomed. They cleared our plates quite fast as well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I often go here.  I found the fish quailty good. I really cannot pick a favorite. We have tried all the  sushi and sashimi and love it. We are not much for other cooked asain food, we never ordered it. Love the drinks! The otome-gokoro and nan-goku are delishious.  The decor is pretty too and love the ipad ordering system. Only issue ive noticed (not with us because we dont call for reservations) is instead of a traditional reservation list they do a priority seating. I believe its do to the nature of the surrounding entertainment area. Lots of bars clubs and such. I do suggest that they do start a real reservation list because they do get really busy. We go at non busy times."}
{"text":"Came to this location since they are fairly new to the area. They had replaced what was formerly \"Sushi Sushi\", which I used to frequent regularly until they unfortunately started to decline in quality and service, so I was optimistic about this transition, since K&B is a chain. 

I was immediately impressed by their more upscale decor and seating arrangements, and the implementation of an iPad ordering system. The hot towel before the meal was a nice touch as well, which I haven't received at other AYCE sushi restaurants. 

Quick tip, at this sushi restaurant I would stick strictly to the sushi and sashimi, since the hot dishes were certainly a hit or miss, with the calamari being burnt to a crisp. Though their shrimp tempura and shrimp dumplings were outstanding! 

Even the rolls I ordered were sub-par, but their sashimi was incredible, presentation and all. My second visit was just for the salmon and shrimp sashimi alone, along with the shrimp tempura and dumplings. My bf got other varieties of sashimi as well (tuna etc) and they were all excellent. 

The service was mixed to say the least.. on my first visit, I felt as though I was being rushed out by someone who appeared to be the manager, who was being outwardly upset with me for paying before I finished my meal? Didn't realize that was an issue, but apparently it was. The second visit was much better, with nothing to complain about and quick and attentive service. 

Would recommend this place for sure, though just like any other AYCE, there are going to be variations in quality, food presentation and service throughout. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Staff was kind..but let's be real. Food is just is more important than service. Although it came out quicker than a blink of an eye on Saturday night, the food was not good. It just did not taste good. I don't know how else to explain it. We ordered everything and nothing was cooked right. 

The rice was too soft and mushy. The noodles had no flavour and too oily. The sushi was rushed and weren't like other places. The miso soup was too salty.."}
{"text":"Sushi wasn't good at all and service was bad with waitresses that don't speak English......... many waitresses there are like zombies who don't even talk to each other...weird restaurant"}
{"text":"Good food, very fast service, very attentive. Can't complain. For an all you can eat definitely worth it. Everything tastes fresh. iPad makes ordering very easy and quick as well."}
{"text":"The sashimi were fresh at all, same as some other food and I wouldn't say they taste good either. The actual dish don't look like anything in the picture."}
{"text":"The service was horrible I was breastfeeding my baby and the server came to tell me that I need to cover my self because there are more people around I found that very disrespectful I will never go back"}
{"text":"One of the best all you can eat sushi places I have ever been too! Great environment, loved the atmosphere. Greeted by friendly staff with warm towels in hand was lovely. iPad menus make ordering easy, food was delivered quickly and everything tasted delicious! Great place :)"}
{"text":"Literally the best sushi in Toronto , my brother and are huge fans of sushi so we always like to try out different Ayce sushi restaurants. Out of all the places we tried this has to have the best service and best sushi , not much variety but they sure know how to set up their menu.

Spicy salmon/tuna handrolls and the white tuna nigiri are my personal favorites !"}
{"text":"Have gone here a few times used to go to another all you can eat sushi near by. We find this restaurant better than the one near by, good service, good qaulity. The options are better compared to other all you can eat. Will continue to go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"the service is very slow and the waiters are pretty rude too ,throwing the plates on the table ,i dont think i will go back!"}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi places in Mississauga (Markham still destroys Mississauga in this area though). Great, fast service, delicious food (though the short rib was a little overcooked) and a very nice decor. I will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this place is good for sushi but I can definitely say this place is good for its curry and rice. I asked a server for extra ginger. The expression she gave me seemed like she was weirded out. I thought I had said something wrong but then another server tended to my needs and I realized that she didn't know english. I didn't expect that.

The sushi I ordered was not fresh, especially the butterfish sashimi. The best sushi I tried here was the Fuji sushi. It was tasty because of the spicy sauce on top. If you do plan to visit this place try their beef pepper. It was surprisingly good, because usually sushi places don't do the beef well and I expected that to be the same here. 

Bottomline, this wouldn't be my first choice for sushi. I would still prefer other sushi places over this. It's too overpriced for the service and food."}
{"text":"Decor 4/5: Very big, modern, and clean. Think it used to be an Italian restaurant that has a wine rack.

Service 2/5: half of the servers looked grumpy, especially the manager. However, they did attend to our needs without a smile.

Price: We went on a Tuesday, for adults it's about  $27 and for my kids 6 and 9, it cost  around $12, which is similar to other sushi AYCE. Note: if you pay cash you get 10% off, but be warned that my husband had to ask for it since they did not give the discount on the first receipt.

Food 2/5: The sashimi are quite cold and fresh, same with their salmon tataki. However with all other foods they didn't look or tasted fresh. The mango salad tasted off and the beef tataki was a little over cooked.

I don't recommend this place and I wouldn't come back here, with so many other options in the area"}
{"text":"Recently returned here as my last review was a good one, but the service was HORRIBLE. My boyfriend had paid for our meal with his credit card while I agreed to leave a cash tip. The waitress didn't even finish ripping off the receipt before saying \"You know the price doesn't include the tip...\"! Clearly, she didn't even see me looking in my wallet for some change before asking \"So, where's my tip?\" with all the attitude in the world. We left before making a scene, but I called shortly after coming home to file a complaint to the manager. The manager did not see what was wrong with the situation. He kept asking me how the service was despite me saying that is besides the point. He even had the nerve to say to me, \"Generally, in this country it's customary to give a tip...\" and by the end of the conversation he kept on ignoring me. Absolutely horrible. Stay clear of this place!!

P.S. For the record, our server was Irene and her service sucked. She was slow and not a attentive at all."}
{"text":"Surprised by the reviews. This is my favourite sushi place in Mississauga. They aren't stingy with their sushi and the service is good. It's fresh and the food is honestly great. They don't have a great variety of appetizers but the sushi is good. I'm a sushi connoisseur and hidden gem of a place is highly recommended for all you AYCE fans!"}
{"text":"My favorite AYCE in the city so far. 

Dishes were artfully placed, food was fresh, the iPad ordering app worked well, decor was lovely. 

Was most impressed with the skill in how the sushi was made. The rolls were not overly ricey like most other places. The layer of rice was very thin. 

Enjoyed it and would come again."}
{"text":"For gods sake don't go here! Service was the slowest I've ever experienced. It took forever for servers to come and approve the all you can eat on the iPad. Food took even longer to come out. Quality of food was not bad though although we sat there for an hour and a half and left hungry because waiting was so frustrating.
We told the server we were very unhappy with all the reasons explained above and she kept asking questions about whether the food was cold or if it didn't taste good... like no, sushi is supposed to be cold...."}
{"text":"KB is good but it's not truly an eat all you can for red tuna shasimi, you just get 2 pieces per person for the night. Don't think will be back."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went for the AYCE lunch on a weekday - $17.95.  The place has plenty of parking and its huge! Decor was modern. They only had your basic sushi, salmon, octopus, california rolls, red snapper, sushi pizza. Not even the normal red tuna unless it was a spicy roll, a little strange. No sweet shrimp, tobiko, beef tataki, nor hamachi. Teriyaki sauce was a little bland but the rest of the food was good: mango salad, udon soup, wakame. Probably will go back since I didn't get a chance to try the rest of the menu - had a few versions of green curry, and stir fry. Good for kids as the place is huge, and free for under 4. For AYCE sushi I still prefer High Park Sushi at Keele and Bloor st W. they have a bit more Japanese cuisine selection to choose from."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and this is my second time eating here.  At first, I was told there is a limit of 16 pieces of sashimi (8 piece per person) for each order.  The second time I ordered, I followed what they advised me which I ordered 16 pieces.  After that, the manager said it should be 8 pieces of sashimi limit per visit per person so you cannot order anymore sashimi.  It felt like the rule change as they want.  The manager also said no other places near by with all you can eat with sashimi for lunch but I don't think that is true.  I thought spoon and fork have sashimi for lunch.  Clearly, there are no rules .. it's like going to a place and they do whatever they want... it felt like ripping you off."}
{"text":"Came here today with a friend and boy was it a disaster! First, the server spilled hot soup on my friends pants. She just stood there and didn't even offer her an napkins or help clean up the mess. It was another server named Shan who was nice enough to help us. We asked the first server for the same soup again since it was spilled but it never came! We asked on 5 different occasions...To add the cherry on top, we found a hair in the ice cream. When the bill came we asked to speak with the manager and the first server said the manager wasn't in. After arguing a bit the second server came back and said she'll talk to the manager. We got a measly 10% off the bill from the \"absent\" manager... THIS PLACE IS GROSS AND UNPROFESSIONAL! DO NOT GO!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worse service, especially if you have children who didn't finish all the food. They will charge you handsomely for it.?"}
{"text":"All you can eat really should be all you can cram into you face and keep down!! This place has some really good food. 

It was a Saturday night and this location was busy busy busy. We made reservations. Not a bad idea on a weekend. We were seated promptly and away we went to order via touch tablet. Love it!!

Started by picking soup, salad and just about 1 of everything! Service was quick and prepared in typical AYCE fashion. 

Most impressive was the sashimi. Nice thick portions and plenty of it!! For the most part everything was fantastic. 

Only a couple of less than great dishes. Avoid the gyoza. Not great and not traditional pan fried and steamed like the Japanese do. It was deep fried. Yikes! 

The beef tataki was good, but slightly over cooked for my liking. It should be seared blue and served cold. Tonight's tataki was cooked too long. A good helping of onion and fried garlic and the traditional ponzu sauce. Just ok. But all the other beef dishes were delicious. 

Everything else from the tempura to the ice cream was really good and nothing really disappointing. Great quality food and good value at $26 per person for dinner. 

Itadakimasu!!"}
{"text":"Not a good dining experience at all. Expect slowest service and half of the food that you ordered won't come.

1.) overpriced $30 for all you can eat. Bill came up to almost $40 per person if you order just a pop. 

2.) service was terrible. The servers are new and have no experience at all. Service is slow. Expect to ask for you bill and wait 30 minutes before they give you the bill.

3.) we came in for dinner as a group. The server said \"lunch is over, we have to charge you $30 for dinner price\" (we NEVER asked her for the lunch menu, we were coming in for dinner)

4.) Half of the food we ordered on the iPad didn't come. Some of the food came 2 hours after we ordered. There's some serious issues with the servers or the owners of this restaurant. The food was average. I would give 2 stars for food.

5.) sashimi was disgusting. The fish and crab sticks was not fresh. It broke apart before you pick it up. Watery sashimi = frozen for days

6.) we didn't order dessert because the service was so slow. We waited 30 minutes for our bill. Which is absolutely wrong.

7.) The server came to our table had some serious attitude. She was really rude. She took the payment and just left without even saying anything."}
{"text":"Very unhappy and unfriendly staff all around. 
Sushi quality is what you can expect for \"all you can eat\". 
Not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"my favorite all you can eat sushi place! my favorite was the grilled squid and the fried sushi! the flavors just melts in your mouth. my first visit here was when they just opened and earlier would've been my 2nd visit here and the restaurant kept up with my expectations. great work & we will come back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my wife and newborn. Found the tables very large and perfect for having a table full of dishes. Sushi was very tasty. Sashimi tasted fresh. One disappointment was that they only allowed to order two pieces of tuna per person. I did not expect that from an ALL YOU CAN EAT sushi restaurant, especially for the price that we paid."}
{"text":"Great tasting sushi, great location, great presentation, reasonable prices. 

Only thing that bothered us was the waiters inattentivness to us. This being our third time here it seems to be the same issue."}
{"text":"I think I've been here 3 or 4 times in the past couple of months for Lunch.  Their lunch all you can eat is awesome!  Pretty good selection of appetizers, sushi, sashimi, and Chinese/Japanese style rice, noodle, and meat dishes.

Their lunch buffet for $14.99 including soft drinks, and dessert is just great.  and now they have a fancy new ordering system with an iPad so you can click your way to lunch time food coma bliss.

I don't eat seafood (I know, right?) but I have the vegetarian sushi, tempura, soup, salad, and other dishes and there is plenty to stuff me up.  And of course top it off with some ice cream!

I really recommend this place.  good service, good food, good price, good atmosphere, good times!  Check it out if you have not been!!"}
{"text":"The menu and quality of food is pretty much exactly the same as the location on Winston Churchill. But there are some items that the Winston Churchill location doesn't have (tom yum soup, custard bun and spinach shrimp dumpling  just to name a few). 

For those that know about Eddie's wok'n'roll, this KB sushi is in the same plaza just a few doors down. 

This location is slightly bigger but decor is pretty plain (not that it matters so much to me but it's not as nice). And in my opinion, the service here is much better! Food came quickly and someone was always walking around to refill tea and water. They smile more and actually respond to your requests and comments. So when you say \"thank you\" they'll smile and even say \"you're welcome\" back...shocking!! 

I'll be back for sure! Will probably bounce back and forth at both locations"}
{"text":"This is a family fave! This is one of our go-to sushi places. We often come in a large group so we always reserve ahead of time and never had any issues with it!

I find that with any other sushi/Asian restaurant, many servers don't speak English or know very little so interaction with staff is always minimal. But hey, as long as I get my food I'm good!!! Depending on which server you get here, it could really affect your experience. I've had one that never smiled, wasn't friendly and didn't seem to care about serving us. During one visit, we sat down and asked for both tea and water....(there were 5 of us) and she replied with \"are you sure? That's a lot of glasses\" .....ummm yea we're sure. She was NOT impressed.  However most visits are overall really good! Sometimes if they run out of an item, they don't tell you...it just doesn't come

Some of our fave dishes:
1. Salmon sashimi (only if you don't mind eating raw!)
2. Fried rice
3. Squid tentacles
4. Shrimp ebi mayo
5. Garlic beef (always soooo tender!)

Overall food is delicious!! Will always keep coming here!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi!!! (for lunch) ($15.95, at time of posting)

And it was fresh, and delicious. I had three rounds of specialty rolls, tempura, hand rolls and nigiri. All included. I couldn't believe it. Professionally prepared and incredibly tasty. 

The staff was extremely efficient and courteous. I had everything I needed at all times. 

Definitely will come back for more!"}
{"text":"My meal started off well but deteriorated the more I ate. My hot and sour soup was very good as was the black pepper beef. Loved the sauce with the beef. The other kitchen items that I had were OK. I did not like the sushi. I tried two of their rolls and did not like either. I had no reason to attempt any of their other rolls. 

I thought that $19 for lunch today was too pricey given the quality of the food. Since, I am in my 70's, I appreciate restaurants that have a senior's price. Unfortunately this restaurant does not have a senior's price.

Service was OK but the ambience of this restaurant is sub par. I have been in numerous AYCE restaurants and this one is easily the most boring. The interior design is poor 

I have no idea how busy this place gets, but there were about 60 people there for Friday lunch. The large section in the back was empty.."}
{"text":"Love the food - especially their salmon tempura rolls.

Only negative comment would be that most times I've been there, I've had issues with their service. One time we had water that still had the pop from the dispenser in it, so we asked for new waters. The waitress seemed agitated. Then later we asked for spicy mayo and she literally threw the dishes of mayo onto the table where we kind of had to stop them from falling over and spilling.

I still go there, but sometimes luck out on service depending on which staff member you get."}
{"text":"We got the all you can eat. There was nothing that said there was restrictions on any item. We found out quickly that when you order tuna sashimi you are only allowed two pieces...wait...I thought this was all you can eat?

But that was just one issue. The quality of rolls here in general weren't good. The flavor was lacking and the temperature of the fish wasn't that of a good sushi restaurant (sashimi should be served much colder than it was for an example).

Servers were lifeless. They moved and talked like robots with no smile, didnt ask how our food was etc. 

I've been to many all you can eat sushi places in Mississauga and Toronto and this was the worst of the bunch.

PS I like to eat. And I no like to eat here no more."}
{"text":"My main sushi spot. Reliable fresh sushi with good atmosphere. Doesn't feel like you're eating right next to other people therefore portrays privacy. Quick service, but don't expect anything special considering your basically served by an iPad."}
{"text":"This spot is one of the most frequently attended by me. I have been here hundred times and will come back here many more. 
 The entire menu is uploaded into the tablet, which makes it very easy to choose dishes you would like to order. Pictures and descriptions belong to every item. The menu range is very wide and fits preferences of every customer, even the most picky one. 
I am a fan of sashimi options and might say that fish here is always fresh and perfectly cut. Tempura is deliciously made, no extra oil and overmuch of bread. From varieties of rolls I like kiwi roll the most, which you can order only on dinner time. 
Service here is very fast, waiters start bringing food right after you press the last button on the tablet. You can literally eat as much as you want, but don't overestimate capacity of your stomach, because if you leave on a plate too much food, additional charges will be applied. 
My experience at this place has never been disappointing, conversely I am always happy to go out from there with huge stomach thinking about how does this AYCE place still making profit after having customers like me."}
{"text":"Went to this place for fathers day with family. It was an overall enjoyable experience but they did have a few hiccups. The food was good and arrived promtly after the server took the iPad to send the order through to the kitchen. That being said, ordering dessert took a little while as the waitresses were too busy to come by and send the order. Seemed like the location was understaffed for such a busy day. A couple orders of sushimi were missed along with the restaurant not carrying regular coffee or sweetener for it. We ordered coffee but got expresso as that's all they carry. It was also odd to see the manager yell at one of the waitresses in another language just a few meters away from the table. Seems like issues should be handled differently. In conclusion, I would recommend this place to a friend and hope that they have a good experience but I would continue looking for better ayce sushi locations."}
{"text":"K&B.. What happened to you guys?

I was super excited to check this place out, after reading Kris U's review, and frequently visiting their Oakville location. 

Sashimi cuts were huge, as other reviews have mentioned. HOWEVER, rice to fish portions for the maki rolls were terrible, and the rice on the nigiri was all stale and hard. WHYYYY. 
I was really hoping to finally have a decent AYCE restaurant in Etobicoke, compared to all the other subpar joints in the area. 

All the cooked dishes arrived greasy and cold. We were missing many orders, 'miscalculated' orders, and the aspect of customer service, seems to be non-existent compared to the Oakville location.

There were a lot of difficulties, getting a server's attention (from the middle of the restaurant, where a server passes you table every few seconds). At a sushi restaurant like K&B, you'd think the servers would be a little more courteous and attentive.

I wanted to love this place; especially with this location is situated in an area I frequent much more, compared to Oakville. However, the standards have dropped, and all you really seem to be paying the price tag for, is the 'fancy/upscale' atmosphere. There are much better quality sushi, elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was going to award a 5th star because this place is friggen flawless, but like a victim of cheating in relationships, I've been burnt before - so I simply cannot put all my love behind this place... yet.

To say that this is the greatest new AYCE sushi joint around would be close to accurate, however, you frequenters of the AYCE sushi spots know about the lifecycle of any good sushi restaurant, if not, allow me to break it down for y'all:

-- Open to 6-8 months - flawless. Generous portions, Huge cuts of sashimi, perfectly cooked... everything and amazing/attentive customer service. Basically the perfect sushi experience. ***This is where K&B is currently at in their life cycle.***

-- 6-8 months to 1 year - sporadic slips in customer service, mistakes, decrease in portion generosity and thinning of sashimi cuts (only marginally)

-- 1 year to 2 year - infrequent/inattentive service becomes a regular thing, sashimi portions are 1/4 what they used to be, quality control slips

-- 2 years onward - find a new sushi joint (seriously, you're lucky to have good sushi at many places older than 2 years). Pending new ownership or management changes, at which point the cycle repeats itself.

As I mentioned K&B is insane right now, everything is amazing, and following two horrible experiences at the nearby Spoon & Fork, they're poised to put a serious hurt on that abysmal AYCE crap joint.

The menu here is unreal, filled with an assortment of pan asian cuisine favorites. I was particularly a fan of the short ribs and their variety of Udon noodle soup dishes, amazing! My one critique is that while they do offer Red Tuna, you're maxed out at 2 pieces per guest, so not TRULY and AYCE (because they know I'll eat 3 pounds of that shit, no questions asked) NOMNOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM #SushiMonster

I'm with-holding my 5th star pending further investigation (many more investigations) and if service and food stays steady into the 1 year mark, I will happily upgrade them. But heed my warning as my EATCREST AYCE SUSHI LAW is more consistent than gravity itself.

Eatcrest Out

PS - OH yeah, and their patio, amazing! Definitely one of the best seats in the house during the summer!"}
{"text":"Everything here is pretty good. Service can be slow at times, but other than that, no complaints! There lunch buffet is also great!!"}
{"text":"Didn't like the sushi at all, fish wasn't fresh and was too chewy for sushi. The rolls almost tasted alike as well. The fillings are all processed or canned crab etc. Definitely is not prepared with the catch of the day or equivalent freshness. Dining area is nice and comfortable. Shrimp tempura is edible."}
{"text":"I ate here earlier today for my birthday and I have to say, it was a horrible decision. A few words to describe this place would be: chaotic, unprofessional, cheap, and misleading. 

First Impression- the place looked pretty promising when we first walked in and got seated. I was pretty impressed with the ordering system and how the place looked. A pretty good first impression. 

Heres where things go bad- the ordering system looks pretty fancy, however dont let all this modernized ordering method blind you. It looks fancy with its set up but what i found pretty disappointing was how they only show you the picture and name of each order. There was no description or anything. All you could tell was that it was spicy or not. Half the special sushi rolls i ordered contained stuff I didnt like so my party ended up having to pay 50 cents per wasted piece. It didnt help when the servers/ food runners literally dropped the plates off without saying a single word. They would just guess who it belonged to and leave. We had to ask each food runner which roll it was and half the time they didnt even know. So another half of the time we didnt know if we were eating the stuff we ordered. 

Food- this is the part that pissed me off the most. The sushi was as small as my thumb. I kid you not. I'm paying pretty much 30$ per head to eat tiny little pieces of sushi thats is just about the size of half a pizza roll. I mean, i wouldnt have mind the tiny pieces if its taste compensated for it but nope. Small and horrible tasting. Whats worse is that it comes in 4s and 8s. So you get tiny ass pieces and a shitload of plates to deal with. To top it all off, the proportion of the filling and rice was completely unbalanced so all you could taste was the mush inside with barely any rice. Was just mind bobbling was that one of the rolls literally had just avocado and tempura shavings stuffed into a roll... What sucks was that if i knew i was getting a roll with just tempura shavings, i wouldnt have gotten it and i would have saved me about 4 bucks for not wasting. 

Service- we asked one waiter a simply question: \"are your sodas refillable\" and all we got from her was \"idk im sorry\"... When out drinks were finished, they would just randomly pour water when we were originally drinking soda. 

Im not sure if this place is new or its just cuz the workers are new but I'm sure as hell staying away from this place. And i recommend all you sushi lovers to do the same. All i can say is that this place is a shitshow. Poor customer service, the workers obviously dont know how to do their job, the ordering system is super flawed, and food is way to crappy for the amount your paying. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"A client advised me that they liked this place, and that it was potentially better AYCE sushi place than heart sushi in her opinion. Of course, I had to go check it out. I went here for dinner with some friends, and I was impressed. The food is on par with heart sushi in terms of quality, but they have have more things on the menu such as white tuna and dim sum. The white tuna costs more than the red tuna, so I was amazed they had it on the menu. One of my biggest annoyances with heart sushi is that the seating is tight and limited. There is always a wait at heart sushi, especially at dinner on weekend. The seating is so tight at heart that I am almost touching elbows with the people beside me. The tables are so narrow  that the food trays almost do not fit on same. This place lacks that issue as it has more tables that are not jammed together like the seats in an economy airline. When I was there, I had no issues with the service. The iPad based ordering system is similar to what heart sushi has, and works without issue. Overall, I will be coming back to this place. Same price as heart sushi for more types of food without the seating issues."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday lunch. Gets pretty packed so get there early. The interior is very nice. Service is quick. Good selection of food.

Pretty much everything was good except for a couple of dishes that wasn't to our liking. The fried rice and the fried banana was delicious!!

People below are complaining about the servers questioning the amount you order. Happened to us as well. But im glad she pointed out how much sushi we ordered because each order is very large and it adds up if you don't know how much you are going to get. As such we didn't get to taste them all.

Other than that your usual ayce."}
{"text":"Overall they have a good selection for the buffet. They offer sashimi during their lunch buffet for $16.95 which is a great price point. We have been here many times however, the last time we came by (shortly after 3pm) they told us the buffet stopped at 3pm. All of their materials, website did say 3:30pm and we have always came in a little after 3pm. The manager gave us attitude, yelled at us and said they would not honour the times online. Very off-putting and not sure if I would return after this experience. It was quite humiliating."}
{"text":"After moving to the area I was happy to find that the neighbourhood has an ayce sushi joint. Though not my favourite ayce (Shitakii in Woodbridge still holds my top spot), K&B is certainly nothing to complain about. The service was pleasant and decently quick. The selection was high. And everything we tried was pretty good. I'll more than likely be going again."}
{"text":"The food was OK.

What was beyond subpar was the service. The most they talked to us was when letting us know that because we were a group there was an automatic gratuity.

Afterwards, they just literally dropped off food and left. We asked for some help, and were unhelpfully told \"just use the ipad.\" We asked if they could split the plates up because there were a dozen of us - they shrugged and then nothing. They would bring us food and we would ask what it was - we actually had the lady grunt at us and just show us the receipt.

Oh and AYCE? Sure, except that the good stuff is limited to 2 pieces per person.

Even the bathrooms were filthy - no toilet paper, no paper, and just a mess everywhere.

[2 stars because the food wasn't awful, but it was merely mediocre.]

I'd steer clear."}
{"text":"A waitress asked us whether we wanted all we can eat. We said no. She brought our drink and confirmed again whether we wanted to do all we can eat. We said no again and then she never showed up. We were staving , so I went to talk to the manager once and still nobody came to take our order. We were really pissed so we left. It is busy there, but they have time cleaning tables and letting more people in, just no time to serve people who don't want all we can eat!"}
{"text":"I'm from Texas where AYCE sushi is pretty much nonexistent. But I've also spent three of the last four summers in Toronto where it's all over the place... so I take full advantage while I'm here. 

K&B is, in my opinion, head and shoulders above the quality other AYCE places in the Bloor and Bathurst areas. I've never had a roll I didn't like, never had a piece that didn't taste good, and I've been coming back time and time again. 

They also smartly did away with the whole \"trying to flag down a server when you want more\" by giving each table a tablet where you just touch the foods you want and it pings the nearest server to approve your order. 

They also have a good variety - not just sushi, but also entrees, soups, desserts, appetizers, salads, and the likes. It's hard for me to make myself order that when I could instead have sushi, but none of those have ever disappointed me. 

Also, tip: Try going on weekdays and try going before 3PM - lunch prices are much lower and as far as I know you have access to the same menu. 

K&B has been my go-to AYCE sushi in Toronto for a while."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Its all-you-can eat. I like how you order from a tablet and they bring your order to you. A lot of great options. Place is always busy, especially on weekends. Washrooms are all clean."}
{"text":"Very efficient service. iPad ordering makes it very easy for all you can eat. We got out good very promptly and things didn't come all at once.
It isn't the most high end place, but I got what I came for--ayce sushi. Service isn't necessarily super friendly but prompt and helpful. Despite going on a Sunday afternoon I had a pleasant experience. If you are looking for a high end sushi restaurant you should probably look elsewhere."}
{"text":"we had all u can eat dinner worse sushi I ever had.  for 60 dollar two can go somewhere else for much better food. service is pretty bad too. never going back again. didnt even bother take any pics"}
{"text":"Hard to go wrong- all I can eat and the door kept coming.  Sometimes portions were small but we just ordered more.  Great place for the kids who are into sushi!"}
{"text":"Great place for AYCE sushi! The quality of the food and the staff are incredible. We were pleasantly surprised at the huge selection available as well. 

Ordering is convenient and with an iPad device. The menu offers pictures but no descriptions. Nevertheless, the fish is fresh and the food tastes great! 

When ordering sashimi, you can only order a max of 5 sashimi pieces per person at each order. 

Try the fried milk dessert -- it's so good!"}
{"text":"I almost didn't go here because of the negative reviews. I'm glad I ignored them!

My wife and I just came here for the AYCE lunch service.

Right off the bat, K&B stands out in terms of the price-to-atmosphere ratio. K&B looks like the sort of restaurant where you spend $15 on two rolls, not AYCE service. The restaurant is impeccably clean, well decorated, and doesn't have a hint of the \"hole in the wall vibe\" many AYCE joints have.

Ordering is done through iPads provided to every table, and it's an awesome system. You scroll through the menu, which includes pictures, and add items to your order. When you're ready for the next round, you can call a server through the iPad. This avoids my primary issues with AYCE sushi - I had no trouble waving down a server, and all our orders came through complete. No waiting on that last elusive roll and wondering if it's taking long or simply forgotten.

Other people complained about the staff, so maybe I chose a good day, but I found them to be wonderful. They were friendly and endlessly attentive - plates were cleared away almost as soon as they were emptied, and our drinks were constantly topped up.

The sushi is good. They're generous with the fillings and easy on the rice, so I walked out full of fish rather than loaded down with rice. We also tried some of their other items, general pan-Asian fare, dim sum and rice. Everything was entirely up to par.

One of my better dining experiences in the GTA, certainly for the money I spent, and I have a feeling this will be my new go-to sushi place."}
{"text":"The food here is average. The dinner ayce is a bit pricy imo and it isn't the tastiest sushi I have had. 

My biggest problem was the last time I was there the owner kept coming to our table to ask us if we are sure we can finish the food. He did this a few times throughout the night and it got quite annoying. We are all aware if we don't finish what we order we pay for it. Either way at the end we did finish our food and I left the restaurant upset and will probably not go back. 

Overall I would not recommend this location to a friend. You cannot enjoy your food in peace without being bothered and questioned about how much you order."}
{"text":"Very pleasant first time here! Everything was good and the minimum amount of rice on rolls and was perfect for us! Service is not the quickest at times and if they want to compete with Spoon & Fork across the street, they may want to step it up a notch! All in all very good and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this experience.  So clean and modern.  Innovative way to order all you can eat.

Food quality, taste and variety amazing and service was great.

Fun time with the family.  Full house before noon on a Sunday is a good sign!

Go!"}
{"text":"This served as my first AYCE experience since moving to Toronto; having favoured AYCE in another Canadian city, I had a basic bar of expectations.

To start, we attended on a weekend dinner night (cost $29.99). The restaurant has plenty of parking alongside the side of its building, and a decent lot behind it.

The interior of the restaurant is a marked step up from other AYCE places I've attended. There are actual plates, comfy booths, and music playing. Considering I would pay $25 for something comparable in other cities, I was pleased.

We had the ordering tablet explained to us, and began ordering. The only criticism is that I wish they added ingredients under the pictures. We'd look at certain items, and try to guess what was in them. I didn't feel like being charged for uneaten food, so I stayed clear of those.

The sashimi was very fresh; I remember reading a review that suggested it was falling apart... not this time. The rolls were proportionate in terms of ingredients and rice. I find some AYCE places overstuff their roles with tons of rice, that wasn't the case here.

Our server was attentive; the longest we waited for her to come back and verify the tablet was probably 3-4 minutes.

I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"For an all-you-can-eat restaurant, where you know you're going to pay around $30 per person for the meal (not including  drinks), I have to say this place is definitely better than most. The iPad ordering system is great, the food comes surprisingly quickly (when I went the restaurant was totally full too), and they have a good variety of dishes to choose from. Granted most portions are smaller than expected, however at the end of the day, you can order as many of them as you want! 

Most dishes were quite tasty. The one exception that sticks out in my mind is the deep fried banana which was definitely under-fried with undercooked batter. My other minor critique is that they don't list the ingredients in all of the sushi rolls. So if you're picky about what kind of raw fish you like (or whether there is any raw fish at all), you're sort of stuck trying to decipher what's in it by the name of the roll and the picture. I'm sure you can ask a server if need be. Speaking of, my server was extremely pleasant and all smiles. If you're looking for an all-you-can-eat sushi/Asian food place, for the variety and speed of the service I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very popular location with funky decor. Good selection of sushi & appetisers. Would like to see more vegetarian entr√©e options."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi all you can eat dinner! Fast, friendly service and very warm and inviting atmosphere. My new favorite all you can eat sushi restaurant in Mississauga/Oakville."}
{"text":"I went to K&B last night on a double date and overall, the meal was just okay for what we paid. We opted to go for all-you-can-eat since the prices or individual dishes were so hefty as it was. Since it was a Friday at dinner time, all-you-can-eat ended up being $29.95. I highly recommend that if you do come here, come on a weekday at lunch, the menu is the same and you will be paying $17.95 for the same experience. 

All the sushi and appetizers that came out were good temperature, fresh, and well made. Unfortunately, the entrees such as the green curry chicken, were a huge disappointment. Moreover, the raspberry mousse and cream puffs we ordered for dessert were completely stale. This place definitely doesn't compare to other, much-cheaper, and higher quality sushi places in the Oakville area."}
{"text":"I really like this sushi spot. I've been for the AYCE dinner numerous times. Love the ipads! It helps when you can see pictures of everything instead of having to ask what is in each roll. 

The salmon sashimi is always fresh as are the rolls. Tampura isn't too greasy. The crispy wontons are awesome! 

I don't find the staff to be as attentive and friendly as other places, but the food is really good and it is always clean."}
{"text":"To keep it short & simple; the service is good (the food honestly comes within 2 minutes you place the order) but the food quality is subpar. The sashimi was not fresh at all!! and everything else was just meh. The meal was just so unsatisfying, you're better off getting your moneys worth somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch or dinner with friends! 
You just pay all you can eat and order as much as your heart desires. They are more than happy to give a quick demo on how to use the app on the iPad, which is super cool by the way! Great interface, lots of fun and easy to keep on ordering.
Food was delicious, we tried a bit of everything! Green chicken curry and dynamite roll were a highlight.
Nice atmosphere, good music in the background, and clean. 
Definitely will be back with friends!"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst experience in Sushi, they are dazed and confused. The sushi was disgusting, the pickled ginger tasted of ammonia, and the miso was only warm, the hand roll which is supposed to be spicy was bland, the seaweed was like it came out of a packet. I have no idea what they think their doing but they're not doing sushi. Down to the point of the wasabi, which was reused I'm sure as there were 2 colours. All in all it was a poor excuse for sushi, and we went al a carte, not all you can eat. Never again, I can still taste the residue, like MSG."}
{"text":"I've been to other AYCE sushi places before... but this is the best of them all. The variety of the dinner menu is outstanding, and the food is very good. The price might be steeper than in some other places with the same concept, but once you start enjoying the food, you will realize that the quality is superb. Service is quick, and you will be receiving food shortly after you order it. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"The decor is much better than your average sushi spot, with iPads for ordering to boot.  The service started off a little rusty - server asks me if it's my first time, I say \"yes,\" she leaves me with the menu and walks off without explaining further.  I think the point of asking someone if it's their first time is so that you can show them the ropes a little.  

I finally did figure out how to order off the extensive menu and the food wasn't half bad.  The sashimi was fresh and the rolls were tasty.  

The service, on the other hand, sucked.  The servers would just throw the plates at the far corner of the table without even breaking their step to stop and announce the arrival of the food.  I've really never seen anything like it, it was that bad.

I'd probably go back just because there aren't enough decent AYCE sushi restaurants in the west end but I hope the management read these reviews and up their service standards as this place has the potential for greatness."}
{"text":"This place is not bad. Considering its always busy, so obviously they are doing something right. Great options, fast service, but sushi is not always the greatest. Do yourself a favour and pop over to Spoon & Fork across the street."}
{"text":"Love going here with a group of family/friends. It's convenient being able to order on an iPad. Service is always fast no matter how busy it is. There sushi rolls are fresh and delicious. Same goes for there teriyaki salmon, beef, chicken, and there black pepper beef is one of my favourites! They have great desserts to choose from as well. I always get deep fried milk, bananas, and an assortment of ice creams. Overall the food and service is excellent and I frequent K&B often."}
{"text":"Great sushi, sashimi and rolls. But I've had enough of 80% of the dishes being chipped. This is not only a health hazard but a safety one too. Going to try to call the health unit to report it as it's gone on far too long."}
{"text":"I had been to the Oakville location before and really enjoyed it.  It's nice to see a Mississauga location closer to home. Great selection on their AYCE menu. The sashimi is fresh, with the scallop, squid and sweet shrimp being my favourites."}
{"text":"They have done a nice job renovating this place to remove any trace of the prior Japanese resto that used to be here. You can order a la carte or AYCE .  Prices are in line with other places and the variety is great. You order off an iPad and there is everything from sushi to sashimi and Japanese hot foods to Chinese dishes such as sweet and sour chicken.

Service was prompt and tea was refilled regularly.  Everything we ordered tasted fresh and tasty although the sushi chefs knife skills aren't great with some pieces being too thick and other slices misshapen badly sliced fish on sushi rice.  We only tried a small part of the menu. 

Definitely worth a trip back to try other goodies!"}
{"text":"I took a date for lunch, and immediately (as we were being seated) got a \"I don't really want you here\" vibe from the server.  That's okay, there were four other servers (plus a manager) working the section, so I figured one disgruntled server out of the pack can't be so bad.  If only...

I will say this, the food was fantastic and the price was really reasonable.  I really wanted to love this place.  But...

As the meal progressed, nobody EVER came to refill our drinks or ask if we needed anything or how the meal was going.  Maybe I'm off base, but I thought these were minimum standards of customer service in a restaurant.

It took several tries to flag down servers, and when we did get their attention to ask for things, they were obviously put out by the fact that we needed things.  Again, maybe I'm off base, but isn't serving me their job?  I thought service was factored into the bill.  Are the people working at K&B Sushi indentured servants?  Are they in misery just working off some kind of debt at this restaurant?  It just would have been nice if the people serving us were in any way pleasant.

When we were seated for our lunch, there were many empty tables, so they weren't particularly busy.  They just really didn't like serving me.

I would have spoken with the manager, but as my date pointed out, he was way to concerned with showing off his shiny jacket to care about anything that was going on in his dining room.

So I'll say here, there's a LOT of other sushi options in the area, I'm going to try all of those before I even think of returning to K&B Sushi."}
{"text":"I've been several times to Oakville location. I liked this one more very nice atmosphere. Welcoming staff, very fresh sushi."}
{"text":"This is me and my friends typical go-to sushi place. The prices are on the higher end, but the quality of the food is typically quite good. There have been some times when it hasn't been as great, or the service has been slower, but this happens (we're all human, we all have our on and off days). I also think this probably happens on the days and at the times that they are super busy. If you're coming on a Friday night or weekend night, expect the restaurant to be packed. I have probably come here at least some 10 times now over the years, and always enjoy my time and the food there. There is also a plethora of options on their menu (iPad menus), so if you or anyone else with you doesn't like fish/sushi, there are a TON of other options. 

The washrooms are also pretty awesome (odd thing to review I know). I feel like I'm in a mini club every time I visit them, with the music pumping and all...

So overall, it is a bit on the pricier side (personally), but I still love to come here with groups of people and take in all the food :| Ohhhh and that fried milk... mmmm... eat that with some icecream at the end of your meal.. so good....."}
{"text":"Easy iPad ordering service, great quality food compared to most all-you-can-eat sushi, wide selection of items. Service is very fast and attentive. Gets busy around noon."}
{"text":"Food comes fast but the service was shit & the food was average for the price . Won't return !!"}
{"text":"My review is based on takeout experiences only. Easy to order over the phone, always ready on time. Pleasant & friendly service while picking up & paying. Lots of parking available. I've only ordered basic sushi rolls from here and they have all been delicious. My go to place for takeout sushi in Etobicoke!"}
{"text":"I was craving for sushi for a while and got K&B sushi brochure mail in couple days ago. I decided to give this place a try.  I have to say, this is probably one of the best sushi place in Mississauga. Quality of the food is good, they came out fast for lunch also. We had the $17.95 all you can eat menu and loved it. Choices are not as much as the one we usually go in Markham but I love K&B's portion control. The maki rolls and sushi are smaller than what we had in other all you can eat sushi restaurants. So we can have many varieties. The other kitchen dishes are delicious also. I love the mango salad, avocado salad and the beef mushroom roll. Will be back soon to try out the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I just came back from this place for my dad's birthday. This place is an all you can eat sushi buffet. The restaurant itself is very clean and very modern. The decor is great! The food is good too and I'm loving the iPad sushi menu. 
However, the reason I'm giving this place 3.5 stars is because there's really nothing special about the food...
Don't get me wrong it's good but it isn't any different from other sushi joints like 168, so I wasn't blown away. 

Regardless, I would probably go back if ever I'm in the area but definitely wouldn't go out of my way..."}
{"text":"Similar to many other reviewers, K&B Sushi is a standard all you can eat fusion joint. Growing up in markham, we were sad to know that there are not much small ayce sushi joints around our new neighbourhood. K&B was the only one around and we decided to try it on a weeknight (cheaper on weeknights than weekends for sure!)

Upon arrival, i was quite pleased with the interior, very modern and clean. Servers speak mandarian and are quite quick in processing your order. This sushi joint uses an ipad to order your items into the kitchen. Once you choose all your selected items, the server will come and type in a password to send to the kitchen to be processed. Variety of sushi here is fair. They have spider roll! Which is something many AYCE joints do not have anymore... in terms of sashimi i was happy to know they have red tuna, sweet shrimp and scallop. A lot of sushi joints don't have these kind of sashimi as well! So i can sorta understand the cost of the meal.

Sushi is quite standard, they have a good ratio of rice and fish and the item's come out quite quickly once the server presses that button for you. The thai food is a little bland.. the green curry we ordered came out like a yellow green curry and definitely was not appetizing but the cashew chicken was apparently very good. Their other cooked dishes like deep fried scallop and beef wrap enoki mushroom were standard but good. Udon was also not bad... noodles were chewy and not soggy like many other AYCE places.

For dessert they have coconut icecream which is rare at an AYCE place... pretty tasty!

Reason why I am not giving it a 4 star though is because the price is a little steep..."}
{"text":"As far as All-You-Can-Eat (AYCE) sushi goes this place is as solid a 4* as you can get bordering on the 5 but not quite.

All the AYCE places I've ever been to in recent memory all have pretty much the same things in common.  They are all starting to go tech with the ordering done through iPads, all seem to have a different menu for lunch and dinner and all range around the same price and offer the same items give or take a few.  These days the only way you can assess an AYCE sushi place is what is on the menu and what isn't during lunch vs dinner... oh and how much does it cost?

That would be true if all the quality was equal which we know just is not the case.  Sure salmon sashimi and nigiri, maki can all be prepared and presented differently but some staples are just what they are no matter where you go.  These mundane items such as seaweed salad, miso soup, even Tempura don't vary much from place to place.

I think what makes K&B special is that it seems and/or looks like a more upscale type of place as opposed to many of the past places that I've gone for AYCE.  The tables are still covered in paper so there's that quick way to change the table for the next customers but the ambiance, service and overall look of the place looks like they're going for a more upscale feel.  The iPads for ordering is done quite simply.  It's not complicated to figure out really.  Items on the menu are broken down by category but there is no real description of anything.  What's that?  You don't know what yakitori or karaage are?  Oh well... For the numerous named rolls which seem be known such as rainbow or green dragon etc... what's in that?  

The menu gives you photos of the food, the quantities are explained in the corner so if you want 20 pieces of white tuna sashimi than you have to click on the \"+\" push to get your desired quantity.  

Being that we went for lunch and we can't see what's NOT available on the menu for dinner we had no idea.  It was not until my brother asked about the coconut ice cream where we were told that's only on the dinner menu.  How else would we know since the iPads were in lunch mode and not displaying what we cannot have (greyed out or red X'd or something).  No, the items we couldn't have were just not displayed so in reality we didn't know what we were missing.

The item selection for lunch overall is pretty decent and diverse.  How much was it?  It was 18.75 after tax for each of us.  Is that a decent price for lunch?  It's more affordable at say Moon on Erin Mills and that place is good too.  

Overall I think what you're getting for what you're paying for is good.  The food is good and you can have as much of it as you want.  The rolls aren't overly done with a lot of rice in fact the rolls have a thin layer of rice so you're getting more inside than out so to speak.  The portions, who cares really... you are able to ask for as much as you want.  The quality is what matters and while I found the pad thai to be under spiced (I'm used to it being hotter) the rest of everything was good.  The katsu was ok, the karaage was nicely done, the fried rice was tasty, the nigiri and other maki were nicely displayed and presented and the food tasted overall, good.

I can't fault the place for looking better than other places and perhaps charging a bit more.  Their selection of hot food we also had ordered included kalbi, sesame chicken, beef and mushroom rolls as well.  Notably they had salmon skin in both maki and temaki which I love but noticeably were missing unagi nigiri but unagi was available in a maki.  I thought that was strange.  Of course white tuna is available as a sashimi for lunch but I don't even know if they had red tuna on the dinner menu.  Not being able to see it on the lunch iPad prevented that knowledge so perhaps ignorange is bliss?  Not many places I've ever seen in Toronto offer maguro as part of a AYCE menu dinner or otherwise.  This is not Miami...

Overall the place is one of the better places I've been for the price for lunch and while my brother has been for dinner before and I have not, he can't remember what else wasn't on the lunch menu but it didn't really matter.  We had a good, decent AYCE lunch at a nice place for under 25 bucks each after tip.  The service was very quick and it was a better than average value for the money since the food was good.  I do want to come for dinner though to get the full experience.  The place really started to get packed after we showed up after 12:15 and by the end of our meal there was a line up to get in."}
{"text":"I would say this is one of the top sushi buffets I've been to. They offer a lot more variety than other buffets- you definitely won't be bored of the food here. Food is tasty + warm when delivered. They use the typical iPad to make orders. Pretty fast service as well."}
{"text":"If you love a combination of curry dishes, rolls, and sushi, then stick to Spoon and Fork. The green beef curry came out with lots of sliced peppers and looked unrecognizable as 'curry'. The rolls did not seem fresh as the fish looked like it was sitting at room temperature. Still waiting for service with a smile at an AYCE. At least tell the customers the names of the dishes as they are being placed onto the tables, too. Save you money and go to your tried and true sushi place!"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband, 2 friends and my baby for dinner.  The waiting area is small. No where to sit. We got an amazing table which was perfect for our car seat. The variety of food was incredible! I've never seen so much food offered for all you can eat! The fish was fresh and the kitchen food was great! Wanted to try everything but I got too full! Down side, I would have expected the servers to more courteous and friendly. Overall, I would come back for the food not the service."}
{"text":"The inside of this place is nicely set up and clean. My aunt and I came for the lunch and while it was empty when we got there it definitely filled up soon after. 
I've always enjoyed using iPads so that was easy enough. Service was quick and the food started rolling in.
I ordered salmon, white tuna and oil fish nigiri? The oil fish (im assuming that's what it was) had an interesting rub on it which I enjoyed. The others were very good, very melt in your mouth. This is about the only thing that impressed me unfortunately.
My aunt ordered spicy salmon roll and I ordered one of my favourites, Philadelphia roll. When the rolls came I was actually pleased because I'm not a fan of a lot of rice. Some places go way overboard with it however these rolls had a very thin layer. 
I tried hers and it was okay. Had better. Then I had some of my Philadelphia roll... And it tasted foul. It wasn't salmon either. I'm not sure if that was an oversight, but whatever combination they had going on in there did not work. I'm guessing it wasn't the fish as I didn't get sick, but I certainly felt sick afterwards and so did my aunt.

I would have probably had a better experience had the roll not tasted horrible. But I'm not sure how they messed that up so bad. It's a fairly common roll. Service also became neglectful after a while and they forgot items, we ended up just leaving. 

Overall I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Bad customer  service taking advantage for young people/Teenagers adding 15% tip in thier bill.."}
{"text":"Saw on yelp that they had all you can eat scallop and sweet shrimp sashimi and decided to give this place a try on a Friday night. Upon making our first order, however, we were informed that scallop and tuna sashimi is only 2 piece per person for the night and sweet shrimp sashimi wasn't even on the menu anymore. Got to say I was very disappointed as that was the main reason I visited.

We ordered other sushi/rolls to try and here is what I thought of them:
Sashimi: decent, nothing special
Seared salmon sushi (they called it fried salmon sushi): tasted very odd... there was chili oil in them (mistake maybe?), definitely not even close to Kaka or any other place that has torched salmon sushi
Spicy salmon roll: 90% avocado. I love avocado but that was not what I expected when I ordered

Obviously their sushi/rolls failed, so we decided to try some cooked dishes that we normally wouldn't even order at ayce places:
Diced beef with garlic: beef was tender but tasteless, garlic was raw and spicy (looks like they added raw garlic after the beef was cooked)
Green curry with chicken: 70% raw onion and peppers, 4 slices of chicken, tasted bland
Basil shrimp: also 70% raw onion and peppers, 3 pieces of shrimp, also bland

Service was terrible. Waitresses and managers were rude. There were a couple dishes (the seared salmon sushi and \"spicy salmon\" roll) we didn't finish because they simply didn't taste good, and they insisted that we pay for remaining food items. (Standard ayce practice, which is not a problem) However when we explained why we didn't like the food, the manager didn't believe us and just said \"finish it, then I will get you the bill\", and walked away. What choice did we have? So we slowly and unwillingly ate the rolls filled with avocado. The manager came back to check on our progress every 2 minutes, and told us we must finish every single piece before we can leave. When we finally finished, he said \"Ok I won't charge you extra. Next time please don't order this.\" (So much attitude, it's not my fault that it tasted bad.) Honestly, I almost felt like I was being held in custody and being punished.

The price was approximately the same as other ayce joints, at $31 per person, definitely not the cheapest. Overall, I would highly recommend you to NOT try this place at all."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner. I've been to a lot of ayce sushi restaurants and this one is definitely...average. The decor is nice and service is pretty good but food is mediocre. The rolls are a bit mushy and the fried stuff are too oily. However their short ribs and custard bun (surprisingly) was good. Some of the fish was not too fresh, especially the shrimp (it had a weird taste). Also the mango yogurt had a funky dishwashing detergent taste that was not too pleasant. 

Overall, quality is not there but at least the interior is nice?"}
{"text":"Probably the best all you can eat sushi. The menu is impressive,  the quality is pretty good and the ipsd ordering  system is cool too"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot for all you can eat sushi (and more). The restaurant has a nice modern design and the atmosphere is great for any type of lunch or dinner. Service is ok, not great - iPads make it easy to order, but staff aren't overly attentive or friendly. Also make sure you get the attention of a staff member when your order is ready because they have to approve it before it's actually submitted to the kitchen.
 
The food itself is pretty good - the sushi is standard, and the rest of the menu is really extensive. There are so many items you can get here that aren't typically on all you can eat sushi menus - the kalbi (Korean BBQ short ribs) being one of my favourites.
They also have good dessert options like ice cream (of course) deep fried bananas, mango pudding, cream puffs and tiramisu.

It's a little more expensive than typical all you can eat places, but I think it's worth it for the variety."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time as a family.  Some of us are sushi lovers, while some would never touch the stuff. When I called ahead, I was told that there were options for non-sushi lovers.  When we arrived, we had a very long and frustrating discussion with our annoyed server about the iPad-type device (she was unwilling to demonstrate how to use it), and the menu.  We were told that either all of us would have to order from the AYCE sushi menu, or none of us could.  We ended up ordering off the \"a la carte\" menu, which disappointed the sushi lovers.  The server was not helpful at all, and provided very little explanation about the menu and ordering options for those who didn't like sushi.  We ended up with several dishes of things like lemon chicken (although it was a small portion, it was delicious) and steamed rice.  We may give it another chance because what we had was delicious, but I'm hoping for a more patient server next time so we can order enough to fill us up, and so we can really get the hang of that menu!"}
{"text":"We all know that sushi restaurants are popping up at almost any corner.  Every where you turn there is a sushi restaurant.  The question is which one to choose.  Everyone has what they cal the \"BEST\" sushi place in their area.  Every one says that their sushi restaurant is better than all others.  Some swear that they need to drive to the other end of the city just to get the best sushi.  Well ive been to my fair share of sushi restaurants and to be honest all the bad ones are all the same and all the good ones are all the same.  They all pretty much serve the same thing so its very hard to choose which is better than the other.  

K&B was my next sushi restaurant to try.  Went there on a busy Friday night.  As I first walked in the door I realized it was quite trendy and the decor wasn't that of a typical sushi restaurant.  We were seated fairly quickly .  All ordering is done from an iPad which I like.  Very little interaction with wait staff.  Food came out within minutes and super fresh.  When going to sushi restaurants quality and timing are huge factors to look at.  All food was tasty, fresh and hot.  

K&B is quite a distance from my house so not really convenient to visit when I have a frequent sushi craving but when im any where near K&B I will be sure to visit."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  The interior is very nice and light and elegant.  Despite a wait we were seated rather quickly (and even faster the next time when we made reservations).  Nicole our server was bright and sweet and very helpful with every request.

The tablet menu system showed us a wide variety of colorful and creative Japanese food, and we couldn't.  Stop.  Eating.

The volcano roll and spicy crab roll were my favorites, perhaps several cuts above an average sushi place's take on these things.  The salmon sushi was exquisite and tasted as if snatched from the river that afternoon.  And the unagi -- oh wow I could eat those all day they were amazing and tender and flavorful, and the sauce didn't eclipse the meat because it didn't *need* to like it does at other places.

Above all, the pork shaomali was a rock star.  Small balls of seasoned, cooked pork served up piping hot with a red sauce.  They were addictive.

I can't say enough good things about this business, the ambiance, the service, and the food.  As far as sushi in Toronto goes, this is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"The sushi here is good but the iPad ordering system needs an update or something. After submitting our order we sat waiting for 10 minutes before the server came to see if we wanted anything. Our order has not actually gone in."}
{"text":"Went here for a weekend lunch with a large group and it was great!  They had an awesome sushi roll that I haven't tried anywhere else, I wasn't able to catch the name, but it's definitely worth coming back for.  The noodles were tasty, the meat dishes were worth ordering.  It's a bit crammed and the layout is not that great.  Where we were seated, I was not able to speak to the server myself, only the other end of the table was able to converse with the server.  It took quite awhile to get any drinks from the server.  However, they were okay with respect to bringing out the food in a timely manner.  They did not seem to miss too many orders. The price is worth coming back for!!! For two people, for a weekend lunch, it is less than 35$ before tip."}
{"text":"Ever since I realized there was an all you can eat sushi location near me, I had been excited to try it out. It is safe to say that my new objective should be to find a good all you can eat sushi location near me instead. 

The appearance of this location set my expectations too high. The designer did a great job in selecting the light fixtures, colour scheme, furniture, etc. but realistically, that's the best part of this location. The service was decent and the food came out fairly quickly as expected, so that was great. But the flavour and texture of many of my favourite dishes, such as the tempura and shrimp rolls were hardly satisfactory. On the plus side, they had red bean ice cream which is one of my favourites. 

If you have been to a few good sushi places, this restaurant may not be for you. I'm not sure if I'll ever go back to give it a second chance, but I doubt it."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday lunch and the restaurant was pretty full. Decor is nice, front foyer and washroom were as cold as outside. The manager walked us to our seat and asked us for our drinks. We requested water and that was about the extent of initiative from the staff. We placed our order and faced the tablet outwards so a staff member could confirm the order but nobody stopped to put it through. We flagged down a lady eventually and she put it through. The non-sushi items were consistent with other AYCE options. The chicken wings have too much breading on them. The sushi rolls were really gross. The texture and temperature of the fish and rice were off and it was not enjoyable. There was only one lady who seemed to come by wanting to give service and kept refilling our water and she was great.

Overall, I'm not likely to return. Many other AYCE options that serve better quality food with better service for the same price."}
{"text":"Went here for my friend's birthday and had reservations but we still ended up waiting 10 mins for a table, that I'm not too picky about just bothered me that there were tables cleaned and open that we could've sat in earlier, but that's not the reason for the 3 stars. 

K&B is located in a very busy plaza so finding parking wasn't the easiest thing, you have to drive in circles for a bit and even the very far parking spots were occupied. 

Very large menu that I enjoy and any place that has an iPad ordering system is a plus for me! We put our first round of orders in and the prompt of \"please wait, your server is on the way!\" Aka the server has to come and confirm the order into the kitchen. Never understood why some restaurants do that because we came in on a weekend so it was pretty busy and had to wait 10 mins to get our orders confirmed and then a couple of more minutes to get the order. To me, I just feel like it's wasted time where I could be stuffing my face and leaving in my food coma ASAP. 

The order that the food came out was really surprising too, we received our sashimi first then our fried items and then our appetizers. I actually ordered an avocado salad in my first round of orders and it came in the middle of my second order and I totally forgot I had order that and I didn't really want it anymore but I ate it anyways. 

The food quality is good as the sashimi pieces were thick and fresh. They did forget stuff like tempura sauce for our tempura and it took us a hot minute to wave someone down for it as well. They weren't really attentive on water refills because we sat around for awhile with empty cups constantly waving someone down for a refill. 

ALSO for the first time in my sushi eating career, there was a bone in my sashimi and it poked my gums so I ended up bleeding a little bit.

Overall, nice place, great menu. If they were to get more staff on busier nights then that would improve service as much more as well!"}
{"text":"LIVE COCKROACH ON OUR FOOD!!

Our second order of sushi came out with a live cockroach walking around on our plate!! We told the manager he apologized and changed the plate but didn't seem too surprised! I would avoid this place at all costs who knows what's going on in the kitchen!!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi at a great price. All you can eat is the best deal as you can try many different things and re-order the ones you liked the best. Service is fast and attentive and the sushi always fresh. They offer non sushi stuff too but their sushi is so good we get filled up and never managed yet to try other things ;)"}
{"text":"My experience for the first time at this restaurant was quite good. Prior to having dinner here I had heard that this place is comparable to August 8. Food wise, I can agree with that. But service wise, this restaurant destroys August 8. The service and care that goes into the customers in the dining area of this restaurant is very very very good. First off, this warm ambience is much superior to the August 8 Oakville location. The waitress was friendly, the manager acting as also a host (who I believe is also part owner), was incredibly nice. Not too much, and not too little. Every single time I required anything from the waitstaff all I had to do was look up, and they knew I wanted to see them and they came. They were not too much in your face, and neither were they nowhere to be found. And extremely nice.

Myself and my family got the all you can eat and used the ipad to select. 

The beef ribs were a touch bland, with a touch of watery sauce, but the Salmon Flower, the Spinach Dumpling (which I personally have never seen or tried before), the Udon Seafood (non soup), the Gereral Tso Chicken, and the Spicy Scallop Roll were all amazing. The freshness of the salmon on the Salmon Flower was very good. It had the cold plump fresh taste to it. I was quite impressed with the freshness being that this is an all you can eat place. That's rare. I found the calamari tempura to be very heavy in the batter, but the deep-fried calamari was amazing. Choose your batter. Even my 5 year old daughter took a special liking to the avocado sushi which was great. 

All in all, this place showed me amazing service, and sushi that tasted fresh with a nice presentation. I will absolutely be returning."}
{"text":"The wait time is a constant problem in this restaurant. Always a crowded area near the entrance, people are constantly waiting to get a table. All the people who sit near the entrance are freezing from the open door and it's absolutely ridiculous to have big crowds of people waiting to get sit and they almost hang on the tables near the entrance. This is the worst place to have a table at. Always ask the table which is far away from entrance."}
{"text":"The look of this place is amazing, love the decor, gives a very modern/chic vibe which is great for the gram. this would not be considered your affordable family Japanese all you can eat restaurant, so only go if you have dolla$ to spend. Disregarding the price, the food is actually good quality, most of the time. Dont have too many complains about that. HOWEVER .... dont get me started on the staff. As you can see from various other reviews, the general consensus is that they are quite unfriendly. So basically one time I didnt order all you can eat, I ordered an entree of fried udon noodles, and when I saw it approaching i said to myself, I hope thats not my meal. turns out, it was, and i knew from the minute i saw it that it was going to taste horrible. So i tried it and I was right, I couldnt eat it. I told the manager guy who is always there and seems to be in charge, and he basically freaked out and got mad at me as if it was my fault that I didnt like the meal, it was very unprofessional. This restaurant makes me feel like I'm in elementary school because the manager walks through the aisles and hovers around tables trying to see if your stealing/throwing out/sharing food which creates a horrible atmosphere, regardless of the cute aesthetic."}
{"text":"Went to K&B Sushi on a weekend afternoon for lunch. The service was good, the food was delicious and the price was reasonable.

We attended the restaurant around 12pm and were seated immediately. The 'all you can eat' menu has a large variety of sushi and non sushi items.

The price for lunch was around $15.

Overall a great experience and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is visiting or living in Mississauga/Oakville."}
{"text":"First time visiting this location past weekend and I was pleasantly surprised ! Food is really GOOD, we didn't do all you can eat but we did Ala Carte and we loved everything we ordered ! We especially loved the dim sums and sushi (crab roll was WAY TOO GOOD) ! 

I love this sushi place and highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"Come here a lot with my kids.  All u can eat has good selection and is very fresh.  Service is really quick. Price is good for quality.  iPads make it easy to order.  Big lace so usually seated right away.  One of my kids has a shellfish allergy and we've never had a cross contamination issue with the sushi she orders, but it's happened elsewhere.  Always trust the food and service here."}
{"text":"I like.  For sushi AYCE in the vicinity, K&B is like a can't miss kind of option.  They class it up nice, the sushi rolls are pretty decent, and probably more importantly -- the other items on the menu are also pretty decent.  I think if you actually are coming to K&B for a full on sushi experience you may as well go somewhere else; there's better sashimi to be found in other places (ie. Yame Sushi about 15 minutes West).  But if you want some K&B (I'm going to guess that stands for killer appetizers and badass asian entrees) you can get enough of the other stuff to make things really tasty."}
{"text":"Food is good been here since opening in March 2015.

Service is just ok. Waitress looked away on purpose and orders are missed repeatedly.

Pour sauce all over my jacket, walked away, and offered only a wet towel for me to wipe it off after telling them the accident."}
{"text":"I liked it a lot but didn't love it, hard to get refills of tea (one of my fave parts of a AYCE sushi lunch) and they didn't mention that you should turn your IPAD out to the dining room when you want to order (as opposed to just pressing the call server button that's there) so my first order obviously took a while. Plus they did spill tea on me lol (careful what you wish for) however the sushi itself was very tasty, well presented and fresh. The mango salad was also good. I didn't do a lot of fusion options. One thing i did like was the option to just order the veggie tempura you like (so if you only want eggplant go ahead, or sweet potato etc vs the standard mix of veggies) I'd go back for sure but only if I was in the area."}
{"text":"The restaurant was really nice. It was clean and spacious. The decor was nice and simple. The menu selection was good, not over packed like other places so what they did offer was well made. The seafood selection was good for an all you can eat sushi place. The salmon teriyaki was delicious!! All the grilled products were good. The fruit ice creams has pieces of the fruit in it so it was refreshing. The service was excellent. They stopped by often enough to check up and the food came out quick. The price was reasonable too"}
{"text":"Visited with my co-workers during a weekday lunch to celebrate an employee's birthday.

Our entire table opted for the all you can eat option. Usually I am not a fan of all you can eat anything as I feel like you end up overdoing it, feeling stuffed and don't really enjoy anything.

The waitress handed an iPad for us to order off of which was handy.

Food was a-ok, nothing in my opinion really stood out as being super delicious but I left feeling full and not gross so that's a plus!

They didn't seem to be super strict about finishing everything but that having been said we only had a few plates with food still left on them.

Would probably return again if a colleague wanted to visit."}
{"text":"Ratings:
Food: 4/10
Drink: n/a
Service: 4/10
Value: 6/10
Hygiene: 5/10
Aesthetics: 7/10

This place opened up after taking over one of the better sushi restaurants I used to frequent. I tried coming here a couple times since then, but the smell of foodcourt-style Chinese food coming from the front doors always kept me away. One of my friends had a birthday and wanted to try this place instead of the other alternate AYCE sushi places nearby, because it was one of the only ones left to try

The food selection is pretty reasonable and it is pretty diverse. The food quality however is another story. Honestly, the best thing I can say about it is that at it's edible. I warned my friend not to order the Chinese food, but he did and definitely suffered from food poisoning and spent his birthday and the rest of his weekend clutching a toilet bowl.

The cost is comparable to any other AYCE. 

The decor is going for a simplistic modern, but has way too many things clashing. The dishes were greasy and had residue stuck on.

The service here was pretty absent. They clean your dishes pretty much only when you ask. We had them come by twice with more food and walk away empty-handed.

With so many other options nearby, I'm surprised this store is still open. I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"It is a good sushi place if you're looking for somewhere that isn't busy and decent service. The issue is the price. It is $20 a person for lunch, and even though it includes sashimi, you're left with a feeling that it isn't worth it.

The sushi is 3/5 I would say, not as fresh or delicious as other places in downtown but still good. Dishes other than sushi can range heavily from not the best to pretty good. I enjoyed the spare ribs and karage, but the green curry and tempura were sub par. Sashimi was good, fresh, but I would like a bigger selection.

What saves this place is the tablet ordering system which I wish every place had. But the servers seem to fumble with it, requesting you to turn it towards them to signal them instead of them being notified in the back room of your impending orders. 

All in all, decent. Probably better than most of the all you can eat places I've eaten at in Toronto but much more expensive and inaccessible without a car."}
{"text":"Quite deliciouis food and dcor which was offset by their COMPLETE disregard fro any [potential handicapped diners. Lots of parking, but not one handicapped accessible space. General lack of handrails at entrance. Multi steps up tot he restaurant. HHpow will they be compliant with the Ontario ns with Disabilities ACT coming in to force very soon. Oddly enpough no way to contact them via email or their webpage!"}
{"text":"In former Sushi Sushi's location on Millcreek and Erin Mills. I don't like sushi so I ate the other items on the slightly expensive side of AYCE. Wait staff efficient. Food arrived at a fast pace. Attracted a definitely younger crowd. Overall I didn't mind it so will be added to rotation."}
{"text":"The food is just ok, first impressions were pretty bad. The person at the front desk looked like he had no idea what was going on and when we got to our table our menu just decided to delete our order before we were finished and then completely shut down. We had to wait for nearly 10 minutes just so they can get a working menu. The price is responsible and I did like the atmosphere. But the poor service and the fact that the menu was mostly useless I doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Alot of selections. Resturant looks every nice. Went for lunch alot of good selections one their menu. Cheese wonton is a winner for sure."}
{"text":"I come here often with friends for lunch and dinner.  The food is great, the selection is great, and the service is always very good.  Two favourite things on the menu are the short ribs and the Philadelphia roll.  Seriously, you can't go wrong with $25 for an all-you-can-eat sushi dinner."}
{"text":"Pretty good, more of a 3.5 star. Came in on a Saturday afternoon without reservations. Appeared very busy and packed. Got placed in a small table on the side of the restaurant, hidden away, and was not looking forward to having to flag someone every time we needed something. Suprisingly, that was not the case and I received pretty fast and efficient service. They have an iPad to order food but instead of sending the order yourself you need to flag a staff member down and have them do it. Even though I was sitting on the side I never even had to flag a server down except to get more tea and ginger. So I was impressed with the efficiency of that aspect of service. 

A friend recommended this place to me and I thought food was a bit better then my usual place, Heart Sushi. They had sashimi included in their lunch menu. I tried a few and would just recommend butterfish and salmon sashimi which tasted fresher. Rolls were good but a bit more limited than Heart. Not a fan of handrolls though, the seaweed was too thick and made it chewy. Also not a fan of the Kimchi, skewers and tofu. Tasted pretty bad. I did like the Kalbi though, it was tendor and soft. If I visited again, I would go for more meat dishes. Desserts were also a little more limited but they had green tea and fried banana so I was a happy camper. 

Overall, I would recommend this place and probably would come more often if it wasn't so far from me."}
{"text":"The food here is isn't bad..went in a Saturday evening and did not have to wait for a table. iPad ordering but you have to wait for servers to come and send your order.. makes the process a bit slow on a busy Saturday night.

Rolls coulda been rolled a little tighter but they were still good. I would definitely not go out of my way to go here.. there are better ayce sushi options out there."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite ayce sushi place. A bit pricier than most but well worth the extra cost. Presentation and food quality is better than some a la carte sushi joints. The interior looks upscale as well. Almost comparable to the Michael Lee Chin Crystal at the ROM. Decent wine and spirits menu for date night as well."}
{"text":"Had lunch at K&B today for the first time. We were seated right away and ordering off the ipad  menu was pretty straightforward. I was disappointed with the limited choices though (no eel except at dinner?) but they seemed to have the basics. We got our miso soup right away and nearly received a few plates that were ordered by other diners and then in reasonable time we got our rolls, sushi (very tiny salmon and mackerel), shrimp dumplings (these were quite good) and seaweed salad. It got a bit more difficult as we tried to order more food. The order didn't go in, a different server than we had initially, came by, looked at the ipad and I assumed placed our order. I happened to ask flag her down to ask her a question 10 minutes or so later and then she picked up the ipad again and asked us if we wanted to place the order. We said yes and I realized it wasn't placed as I thought earlier. We finally got the second order. For an all you can eat, the choices were too limited and at $22 each (incl pop, tax and tip), I thought we paid too much for what we got. Perhaps dinner would be worth it but for lunch, it was just ok to me."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  I went during their all you can eat hours (Weekdays 11:30am to 3pm) and had a feast for $19.  I like sushi but it can be pricey.  Crab pizza, Salmon roll, tempura - all tasty and high quality.  You order on a computer pad and they bring it right to your table!  RECOMMEND!!!"}
{"text":"May wife and I really enjoy this place. We have gone a few times for lunch and have not been disappointed...hard to beat for around $16 per person for all you can eat (lunch price). The sushi always tastes fresh. I would like more of a description while ordering on the iPad as to what it is, however the pics are nice to have. There is also a good selection of non sushi items for those who prefer something else. It will probably become a regular for us."}
{"text":"Food is good, not remarkable. The atmosphere / service needs work. Waiters are flying around throwing plates on tables and rushing away before you can speak to them. Also, the ladies room was revolting."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and definitely LAST. I didn't enjoy the first visit as I found the food to not be fresh at all and the manager was quite arrogant with us. 

Food: Didn't like the sushi at all, it was very very dry. Fish wasn't fresh, we specifically told the server to make sure our sushi rolls came without avocado and every time they got us our order it had avocado. we couldn't eat all that dry elastic food but made sure to finish all the sushi rolls we got and yet the manager got angry and told us he'd charges us $5 extra, we refused to pay anything extra it wasn't our fault the food wasn't fresh, which we ate most of tbh and all the sushi rolls. And when my friend wanted to order dumplings, the manager took the iPad from her and told her \"you're not ordering anything till you're done with your food\". I was in SHOCK! He was very openly rude and condescending for no reason at all. 

Service: Very unpleasant service, servers kept bringing food to our table that we didn't order and they also didn't bring some of our actual order."}
{"text":"This my my husband and mine date night spot biweekly. Food is excellent and the longterm staff are friendly and attentive. With the growing popularity there is sometimes a wait and id love to be able to make reservations. Some lunches are hectic and you have to call over the closest server to you. I particularly like the great selection of food on the menu. Great decorations and candle lit vibe."}
{"text":"I used to like this AYCE resto but not anymore. The MANAGER was so rude and doesn't know how to listen to a customer complain. He should go back to gradeschool as he doesn't have good manners. If you complain don't expect him that he will listen to you because he will totally cut you off and insist that you're wrong. Pay attention to the food you're ordering because some of them they don't arrive on your table. If you order a lot in one batch you will wait for atleast 15-20 minutes for all the food to arrive like i said they don't serve some of them. They hold all your orders in the kitchen and they serve the food on your table all at once so you're probably gonna get piss while waiting for all your orders to arrive. They don't check your drink if you need a refill, you have to tell and ask them for it. Whoever owns this place they need to fire the manager or put him on a training for customer service 101"}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for a nice place to go for some sushi on Friday. We decided that K&B's all you can eat offer may provide us what we were looking for. We made reservations for a table of four and were promptly seated upon arriving. Each table was equipped with an iPad that all guests per table are to share. I found this a little troublesome as the menu is on the iPad and as a first time guest I really didn't know what the restaurant had to offer so I had to wait my turn to see the pictures and order once my friends were finished. 

The food was not bad, but on the other hand it really wasn't great either. There were quite a few times where we waited and waited for something to come before having to ask our waitress because somehow our orders had gotten lost in cyberspace. I think the best thing I ate was probably the green salad. Near the end of our meal everyone at my table ordered the cream puffs and we can successfully say they were the most disgusting thing we had eaten during the night. The cream was old and the puff was filled with some kind of jam... sorry to say but costcos frozen profiteroles were better than the ones being served at K&B. The sushi was meh nothing special about it. 

Before tax our bills came up to 32.89 and this did not include any booze or soft drinks which I found to be a bit much but this is due to the \"all you can eat\" pricing. I am in no hurry to go back here!"}
{"text":"Call for delivery, no they don't deliver anymore. Went to pick it up
Ordered top price $$$$ yellow tail tuna got previously frozen mackerel instead
Ordered salmon egg sushi, got a thick rosette of salmon  around a ball of rice topped with mayo and sprinkled with flying fish eggs... this was not good
Miso soup was water with salt and two cube of tofu, this place assume people ordering on the phone are moron and don't know their fish, will never order or go there again."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because I had heard positive reports of their Oakville restaurant. The first thing I noticed was the incredibly bad interior design. It was cold and uninviting. I am a fan of the interior decor of some other Mississauga restaurants such as 168 Sushi and Heart Sushi. Ye's Sushi also looks terrific. I looked at the photographs of KB's Oakville restaurant and was impressed with it's terrific interior design. The exterior signage in Oakville is also much better than Mississauga. Why did they switch designers? This place looks like it was designed by an amateur. 

The second thing that I noticed was the classy white tablecloths. This look was negated by the sheets of white paper they placed over the tablecloths. I quickly found out that the soy sauce bottles they use drip badly and the paper was necessary to protect the tablecloths from being stained by the soy sauce.

My lunch started off quite well. My hot and sour soup was excellent and my mango salad was fresh. As the kitchen items came up first,on their ipad menu, I started with them. The garlic beef was terrific. The seafood udon was fine. Some of the other kitchen items such as a chicken in batter item and a pork skewer were  poor.

When I moved on to the sushi, I found that the sushi options were limited and very basic. They didn't even have a salmon rose. It was basic supermarket style sushi. The first sushi roll that I tried was OK, but the second roll was inedible. I started to gag and couldn't finish it. 

Service was quick and friendly. Prices were on the high side, but they do have an introductory 10% discount. No discount for seniors, but they have a children's price. They take cash, credit and debit.

I rather doubt that I will return."}
{"text":"Consistent high quality sushi. Not especially fancy but if quality and service is important to you than this place will not disappoint. I eat there at least 3 times a month. Great value too."}
{"text":"Worst experience EVER!!! Arrived at dinner time, restaurant was not busy, but had a musty smell in the air like dirty wet socks... I assume it was the carpeting and upholstery. We were seated, used tablet to place order, called for our server. We waited 19 minutes, our waiter finally came, sent our order to kitchen. As we sat there, the restaurant got very busy and filled up. To our surprise and disappointment, many of the tables that were seated after us, received their food, ate their meal, finished their dessert, and we're ready to leave, and we still hadn't received our food! No manager was on duty this evening. Acting supervisor finally had some of our food brought to our table, but it was all cold when it arrived. We asked for freshly prepared food, but we were denied. Supervisor (Ben) offered us 10% discount for our inconvenience. We decided not to eat, and simply got up and left. Horrible service, terrible excuses, and we were repeatedly told if we want to leave, it is our choice, but they were trying their best. Their best???!!???? If this was their BEST, I can't fathom to imagine what their worst could be!!!! Clearly this place is on a slippery slope downhill when it comes to cleanliness, quality, and customer service! Garbage strewn around front door, all live plants were dying, glass doors were filthy dirty and hadn't been cleaned in months, even the glass doors on their showcase wine rack were filthy! I used to be a frequent customer, but this experience has convinced me to not ever return. Requires new management, and new employees. Save your money, cross the street and go to Spoon & Fork!!!"}
{"text":"There aren't too many AYCE Sushi places in Etobicoke. This one though, is pretty good. Easy ordering through the iPad and the servers are attentive and most of them have great manners (not reaching over, saying please/thank you/you're welcome, etc..) Getting seated is goes pretty quickly and if they are busy they'll let you know the wait time. Getting food is prompt too. Drinks are also taken care of, they probably watch and will ask if you want more. Food quality is pretty good. Delivered promptly and they will ask if eveything is ok. Price is as expected for an AYCE. This place is pretty pleasing :)"}
{"text":"my boyfriend and i love this place and ayce sushi. 10% off when you pay with cash!
we have gone twice for dinner together and both times it was quite busy but we didnt have to wait to be seated. 

The first time we were waited on quite a bit by the managers (dressed distinctively in suits) but maybe that was just because they were helping out. Never had any issues with service.
We are always happy with this place except for this past Saturday night we had one tiny complaint which is more laughable then anything...

Our first round we ordered some light things, soup and salad, starting small. The second round is our \"fried\" round, then we have our maki/sashimi round and then dessert.  

We were just starting our fried round and we ordered various dumplings and tempura items. Now keep in mind each \"order\" is one or two pieces so it wasnt that much...
We submitted our order on the ipad and the waitress came over to process it. She suddenly exclaimed quite loudly \"10 shrimp tempura!!?\" 

I replied yes... thats correct. C'mon now... each order as I said is 1single piece of shrimp. There were 2 of us. its AYCE sushi!!!! 
Anyways we laugh about it, its become our main punchline for everything. 
Maybe she thought we were going to waste it... who knows.

She was just a lot snotty and when we put our maki round order in, i joked no more shrimp and she barely smiled. All the other ladies were nice. 

Just wish there were some descriptions on the ipad along with the pictures.

The new coconut ice cream is super yummy with the deep fried banana!
And the good thing is that the portions are small so you can try a lot of different things without wasting anything."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi and other asian dishes along with several more italiany appetizers like fried calamari and scallops! For the entire month of April when this gem of a restaurant opened they had a promo where they gave all diners 10% off their order but now it is around 30$ per person/ dinner on a Friday night when i usually go, been there around 6 times now and I absolutely love their sushi! They are not adding a large amount of rice to fill the rolls as a vast majority of ayce buffets have started doing now. They offer good varieties of hot sushi, sushi pizza, rolls, sashimis, beef and chicken dishes, mushroom pancakes that are to die for!  My favourite restaurant right now and service is always quick and efficient!!  Unfortunately i don't have pictures as i usually go with family who think taking pics of my food is lame:-( will try to sneak some next time:)"}
{"text":"@kbsushi next time you have something on your website you should really honour it. 

The restaurant expected us to pay the full dinner price even though it clearly states on the website and on the take out menus that holiday lunches were still at the lunch prices.

What a disappointment."}
{"text":"It's just OK.

Went here for Xmas 2016 with my family. My parents ate a variety of items (salads, soups, stir-fry's, etc) while I stuck to sushi rolls. 

Service is OK.
Selection is OK.
Environment is OK.

I have nothing negative to say. I'll likely come here again, but as a last resort not a first choice. My parents felt the same."}
{"text":"Pros: 
There is a big selection of rolls to choose from
 *if you only eat rolls you'll probably like this place a lot 
They had mackerel sashimi which is my favourite (a lot of AYCE places don't)
Atmosphere is nice and clean-looking 
Servers were friendly
They have some really good custard buns 

Cons:
It didn't get my appetizers (takoyaki, tempura)
It took a long time for food to come
A server has to approve your order every single time before sent through (which is inefficient IMO)
There was a limit of 2/person of a specific type of sashimi (I can't remember which ones, but one was tuna)

Overall this place is alright, would still prefer to go to Heart Sushi"}
{"text":"Listen... this place is awesome! They have amazing food! AND FINALLY THEY HAVE GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! They used to have the worst waiters.. now they have one guy handling everything and making sure everyone is happy. Great atmosphere! Great sushi! They even have red tuna which nowhere else has!! Come here you won't regret it!  Ferdi is THE MAN!!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, super overpriced. When I went to pay the waitress literally took my debit card out of my hand and typed in a five dollar tip and made me pay it..."}
{"text":"best sushi!!! great quality, fast service, a very nice atmosphere and the place is very elegant. highly recommended!!!!!"}
{"text":"Despite the fact that this location just recently opened, it was completely unacceptable as a franchise. I don't know why, but the sashimi they provided was actually room temperature and borderline warm. It was disgusting - I've been to a lot of sushi places before and I can absolutely guarantee everything I've tasted today was questionably unsafe.

I've been to the other KB sushi locations before and I've been very pleased about it - this was a complete let down.

To start off, we've had the beef tataki as appetizers. The beef tataki was pretty much cooked through, hardly beef sashimi as it should be. The shrimp tempura that it came with did not come with any tempura sauce and it had a lot of batter on it.

When the sashimi started to come, it was placed on a bed of ice that was already melting. All of the sashimi (salmon, white tuna, tuna, scallop, octopus, squid which was yellow [see pictures]) were warm. At first, I thought that I'd let that forego and maybe it was a bad batch for whatever reason. During my second order, again all of the sashimi was warm but I couldn't help but felt the need to speak up why the squid sashimi was yellow. 

Now for all I am afraid of - all of the sashimi again, was warm. I asked the manager at the time that the squid looks weird - that it should be all white. At first, he told me that the squid probably touched something which is why it is yellow. I asked well, why is the whole batch yellow then? It is not just a single piece. He went back to the chefs and then had the audacity to tell me that \"the squid batch is probably from whichever ocean it came from, these are 'naturally occurring' colours\". Absolutely appalled by his explanation, I decided to take the review here and inform other Yelpers before coming to this restaurant that this is currently what the quality of it is at.

I am extremely disappointed with this restaurant and I know that I will not be returning back for a long while."}
{"text":"Decor was comparable to other K&B Sushi restaurants. Wait was unexpectedly longer at this location than what I've experienced - however it was about 20ish minutes wait for a table of 3. For a Saturday night - not bad. 

Moving onto the food - the waitress came back to our table that we ordered too much sashimi, totalling to 100 sashimi pieces in one order. She claimed that not all of it will come which is fine since it is expected that in a AYCE, not everything comes as per the ask. 

Delivery of food took about maybe 15-20 minutes additional but that was okay still until what happened next for service...

The max order for tuna and scallop is 2 pieces per person, so we ordered 6 pieces of tuna, and 6 pieces of scallop for the evening. Waitress only brought 4 pieces tuna and no scallop. The assumption was that they would finish the delivery in some other plate some other time. Albeit, nothing came so we ordered the remaining amount through the iPad. Waitress said that we already ordered the food - agreed, however we explained we didn't receive it. She started to doubt us saying \"are you sure it wasn't there? The scallop pieces are small so it's very easy to mistake\". Afterwards, she said that \"I will put in this order and will count it in front of you\" which then called the manager up to our table to affirm that we will get our scallops and tuna. 

I don't believe it should be the customer's responsibility to ensure that we had the allotted 6 pieces total per tuna and scallop because the staff should've took the initiative to count it in front of the table to begin with if they are very tight and strict with that policy. 

Overall near closing time, they really rushed the closing of desserts and bill. As soon as we paid and went for washroom to come back to our seat to get our coats - they eagerly came to us and said that \"oh we closed now\". And implied that we had to leave, now."}
{"text":"Fast service, sushi is delicious.  Atmosphere is also great.  iPad ordering is available, so you can review your order and send it in to the kitchen when you're ready.  

I had tempura fried shrimp, delicious.  Has the usual fare for ayce sushi but is a cut above for quality.  Would return."}
{"text":"Went here for a work lunch outing. Being a first timer in this place and having the cravings for sushi, my expectations were high.

First impression, place had a good feel. Design was very impressive and the booths were very comfortable. The balloon ceiling lights was a great touch and was perfect lighting. They also rocked the iPad menu, whoooaaaa. Just kidding, iPad menu don't impress me.

The servers were nice and quick, but looked flustered. Although, they attended our group constantly, but consistently forget our request like...plate, wasabi, napkins and water. But not a deal breaker, it was really busy.

Considering that the group was craving sushi and came starving, we were ready to demolish the food. Here is one pet peeve of mine that restaurants consistently do, they don't bring food to a table as a bunch, which would present really well and a great wow factor. Anyways, we got our food plate by plate. Group of 8 some people would wait until a next plate comes to get some munchies. Poor presentation I would say.

Quality. Well, I don't think their sushi was very good. It was bland and not presented very well. Our spicy sushi, was missing the spice...some sushi didn't even make it to our table. Good thing it was lunch price since I would be so annoyed paying 25 bux for below quality standard. We also ordered other meals such as chicken, teriyaki and fried goods. It was lacking flavor. But anything fried is pure awesomeness.

Considering it was busy, I believe that this restaurant deserves a second chance. But first impression on food is important and prolly cost them a future customer. But I shall be back when I'm nearby and craving sushi. I love sushi."}
{"text":"One of the best all you can eat I've experienced in Toronto so far! 

The place is pretty big and great for groups, however; it's very busy and noisy on weekends. Service is not very fast, it's moderate. Price is a little bit high! 

The food is the best part though! Love their Sushi rolls and I'd definitely come back to this place for another all you can eat!"}

{"text":"Great place. Very nice quiet ambiance, good for a night out with a coworker or friends or even a date. Not too loud like many other all you can eat sushi joints. The sashimi tasted good and fresh, even for 9pm.. Use an iPad to order so you don't have to flag down the waiter. The wait staff are friendly and speak English well. Food arrives timely and presented well, a rarity in many of the all you can eat places I've been to."}
{"text":"I live in NJ and go to Oakville 2x/year to visit family.  I dream about going to K&B every time.  In fact, I'm going next week, and I'm going to make my reservation from now.  i'm a sushi snob, and only eat the best quality stuff. This place is it! and the amount of actual fish in each serving is very generous, unlike other all you can eat places that increase rice."}
{"text":"Had a great experience the first time last year  when it just opened, however, this time around, I had a totally opposite experience.  First off,  the service was not up to standard, we were rushed to leave the establishment, as it's getting close to closing time.  We were told to order everything, including desserts, so we did, and when the food came, all desserts came along with them (ice cream & pudding), which we had to tell them to bring them back as they would  all melt, as we were finishing our food. They didn't seem happy about that.  In addition, the last round of food , some were served cold, some hot food were served in cold plates. When we have some food left behind, the manager expressed his disappointment that we left some food behind and wasting their food?! I was then being honest with the manager, & told him the reason why we have left food behind, because they were not tasty & fresh. 
It has not been a great experience at all, to me, nor to my two friends, and would never come back again."}
{"text":"The best part was the environment--spacious, good lighting, classy Japanese theme. The tablets were cool too, but you can't see any descriptions for the menu items. Service was another story: ask for water, inquire about the menu, and you'll get hurried responses from disinterested servers. They did remind us, at least 3 times, that they were firmly closing at 10pm (I wonder why?).

A la carte pricing was decent: $15 or so for 18 rolls. And they were tiny! Rice was hard and dry, and some of the food looked and tasted like takeout from Loblaw's at the end of the day. Kudos to them for having spider rolls--but they were were just ok.

K&B Sushi gets the job done in this side of town. It's a fair way way of rounding off your night after a movie at the nearby Cineplex. It won't be \"wow,\" though."}
{"text":"A little slow at the start but once they realized we were here to eat, they did good! This sushi surprised me!! It was very good. Sushi was fresh and was not fishy at all. They had a huge selection of items to choose from and liked everything we ordered."}
{"text":"Wow. Terrible obnoxious. Rude. Told us they need us to hurry so they could go home on time. We arrived at the restaurant@10 and by 10:15 they're telling us to hurry or.  This place sucks rocks.  
Plates are all chopped. Glasses chipped. Dirty floor. And we haven't ordered yet.  Waiter is amazingly slow with his tablet while taking our order.  
Suburbia shit hole.

Ok, I've never before edited a Yelp review. The waiter barely spoke English;  few of the staff do. The waitress' poor English was excusable until she made fun of one of us for being too old to read the extremely small, 8 point tan print on a darn brown menu in dim red light. Then the owner put his hands on top of two glasses, covering the rim with his palms. Terrible manes,  terrible service. All in our group agreed we will not be returning.  I wish there was a no-star rating"}
{"text":"I like this place and have been there twice so far . The sashimi were fresh and came in nice presentation, on  a bowl of glowing ice. I loved the fact that they have sweet shrimps. Tuna and scallop are limited item, but the fact they have it is a bonus. 
Chicken yakitori is good, I have eaten a lot of chicken skewers in all you can eat buffet, but they are just chicken skewers not yakitori! This yakitori is closer to the authentic one( can't really compare to the authentic way but close) 
Sushi rolls are fine, nothing special but they taste good. Lots of filling not too much rice which I had some other AYCE the rice amount is crazy! Sushi nigiri are also good. Rice are firm but not hard, fish is fresh. The rice ratio is acceptable. But the torched sushi is a bit disappointing, I don't know why they put hot chill oil at the bottom of the rice, all you can taste is the spicy oil flavour. I rather they just torch the fish and don't put any weird sauce with it. 
I really like the salmon tataki , I love it so much that I ordered 2 places. The sashimi is thinly sliced and lightly torched. The sauce the right amount of sweet and sour , with the lettuce underneath the fish really help to clean the palette . 
Hot foods are good. I like the fires noodles. Hot and flavourful! 
Servers are really nice as well, as I stated in my previous reviews I am not big on service, as long as they are nice not rude I am fine. 
I will recommend  as AYCE!"}
{"text":"Came here to try a new place than our usual Spoon & Fork... Service was very slow. We didn't get some items we ordered. Food came out cold. And the place was too cold from the front door opening and closing. Staff should've turn up the heat in the restaurant. I prefer Spoon & Fork over this place."}
{"text":"WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This place sucks. I made reservations at 3pm for this restaurant for my family and when I got there they told me that they didn't have my name on the list. I would have hoped that they would have been accommodating to the fact that they made a mistake but they just told me that they don't make reservations on the same day. I have been hear before and the food is okay, but it isn't anything to talk about. 

I would recommend that you don't go to this place ever."}
{"text":"Probably more like a 3.5 but 4 is okay. This place is easily one of the best AYCE restaurants on the West End of the city. That said AYCE's are normally not very good- so the bar starts pretty low. Basically I would recommend it if you were in the area and wanting to go to an AYCE place but I would not make a special effort to go if it's out of the way. The pieces are small (which is nice bc it's harder to over order) but some people might not be used to that in comparison to other chains."}
{"text":"We use to come here very often. Sorry to say this is our very last time. We will never recommend this place to anyone anymore. Took 10mins for us to be seated wasn't even super busy tonight. Manager gave a 2 chip plate. We ask for new ones apparently they are out of plates... New ones are coming in next week he could of switch our plates with another table.  sashimi was not fresh at all had a funny taste.  We had 5 pieces of mango roll  left cause it was gross had maybe 3 pieces of sushi left from the other rolls. The waitress  try to make us finish it cause she didn't want other people to see we are wasting food.  She just stood there and stare at us. We refuse and she left.  Overall service level was slow ,food was decent and Sashimi was bad."}
{"text":"I arrived before 5:00pm and no one in the place.

It took 30 minutes to get my order and people that arrived 15 minutes after me got their food in minutes.

I complained to the Manager and he didn't even care.

The food arrived and it was the tiniest piece of Sushi you have ever seen.

The Albacore was very fishy tasting, sure hope I don't get sick.

I used to love this place.

The Manager of a Restaurant should never be an asshole."}
{"text":"This is one of Lee's son's favorite places to go, so when we were up in Toronto for the holidays, we had lunch here at his recommendation.

It's a nice place, with an AYCE menu. You are seated at at table, offered drinks by a server, and then you use an iPad to make your orders, which are a really wide variety of dishes. There's everything from Dim Sum buns to sushi and tempura, and even Thai curries and other dishes.

The food is prepared well, and was quite good! My only complaint was that after a couple of rounds of ordering, the pace really started to slow down, and we often found ourselves twiddling our thumbs waiting for dishes to show up. A couple of times, we ended up not getting things we ordered at all, or getting something we didn't ask for. 

So, overall, a kind of mixed experience for me, but I'd go back here."}
{"text":"Was really happy with. My first experience here. It's now one of my fav all u can eat sushi in the city. Food was fresh delicious good portions. Huge variety to choose from order on an I pad. Loved the Volcano roll. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday for their AYCE lunch buffet and was impressed at their quick service. Quality of the food was also good and their were a large variety of dishes to choose from. Only downside was that my buddy and I were getting rushed out of the restaurant and they placed the receipt on the table when we still had some items left. I understand they want to turnover the tables quick, but I still feel like we were rushed"}
{"text":"The food was really great! The variety and options are fantastic! However the service isn't so great. Everything and server would bring me food they had this unpleasant look if unhappiness and should that they didn't want to be here. Also I've notice that there were a couple of servers pointing and laughing at what I was eating. I do not appreciate the service but I do appreciate the food!"}
{"text":"Was really delicious...Lots of choices, amazing place to dine with a GF,  Price was a bit hight comparing to others but it is worth trying.. I would definitely recommend it.."}
{"text":"Located in the previous Sushi Sushi location, this completely redone interior feels much more upscale and has the food to match.

Tablet PC ordering is now standard and the menu has even more variety than other alternatives in Mississauga.

Food came quickly and portions were good. The Tuna hand roll was packed full of tuna for example. Tempura was very lightly battered, exactly the way I like it. 

This is my new favourite Sushi location. 

Months later... keep coming back here. The food only seems to be getting better. Service is still outstanding, nice portion sizes. Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Ok, so this is my alternative to Manderin buffet.  The concept is a little unique for all you can eat places.  You order on a tablet then you start seeing the dishes appear like magic.  The food is tasty and you can keep ordering all you want until you can't button your pants any longer.  Great place to take groups and pricing is similar to Manderin."}
{"text":"They took our reservation over the phone and denied doing so when we got there. Grease ball manager denied that they even take reservations. Said he would make it right by putting us on \"priority list\" which is just the bottom of the regular wait list. I suspect the manager gave up the reservation when he saw it was a busy night. Definitely not cool way to run a business.

Food is definitely not work the wait. No attempt to right the wrong. Do not recommend. There are better choices in the area."}
{"text":"iPad ordering made me feel like I was in Japan again.  All you can eat was worth it. Very friendly staff and food came to the table quickly. I was very happy with my experience here."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was ok. One of their staff members stole my credit card number, so I had to change cards."}
{"text":"Service was fast and sushi was good. A bit pricey for lunch and I find their choices to be less than other AYCE in terms of sushi, and too many choices that are not sushi (lots of Chinese food)."}
{"text":"Pricey AYCE lunch ($15.95 + HST + tip). But the sushi was very good.

The decor is modern and clean. I'm not sure if using paper \"tablecloths\" was the right choice for tables. The tablet menus are functional and generally responsive, but they're missing a table stand for the tablet since they're quite large and take up a lot of space. Most menu items have a picture, and also make the portion sizes apparent. There are several Engrish moments on there \"successed\".

The salmon sushi was thick and fresh. The presentation of all the sushi dishes were well done and the sushi had a sufficient amount of real (eg. salmon) content. There were no issues at the time we went with missing (\"forgotten\") dishes (despite ordering a lot) as happens in many other AYCE sushi places and the food arrived in a timely manner. The salad dressing was watery and had little taste.

They also have dim sum items on the menu. The siu mai were average and the BBQ pork buns were good. The portion sizes are small, so it's easy to sample it.

The soft drinks are not included in the lunch menu price. Unsure about dinner menu.

In summary, it's good. But I'd expect it to be this good at the $15.95 AYCE lunch price."}
{"text":"2.5-3*  Food-wise, not as good as first time.  Flavours were lacking and orders were forgotten - not necessarily a \"bad thing\" when you're stuffed!

Quick update, but felt it had to be written since today's experience was different than first time.  Note:  I did not order any udon, fried noodles, or fried rice.

Sushi was just awh-ight.  I definitely wouldn't do a takeout from here.  Many items, e.g. Garlic Beef (in chunks), Shrimp Tempura, Unagi Pancake were bland, bland, BLAND.  Garlic Beef had nice garlic/beef flavour, but lacked salt, as did Shrimp Tempura.  Not sure if they forgot to season, but I remember the Garlic Beef being bland the first time 'round as well.  Har Gow was probably pre-steamed as the wrapping was falling apart, inside was alright taste-wise.  Siu Mai had this weird garlicky taste!  Have never had garlic in my siu mai before.

More orders + drinks were forgotten during this visit.  And although some dishes were just plopped down without any explanation, overall, the service is fairly good for an AYCE place.  Polite and friendly for the most part.

Could use improvement:
-  flavours, especially seasoning on some of the non-sushi dishes
-  fulfilling orders
-  more consistency on items like Kalbi.  First order, dark, decent flavour.  Second order, lighter in colour, not cooked as long, and fatty/gristly
-  it would be a GOOD IDEA if they provided description on some of their rolls when you click on that specific item...instead of asking the busy waitstaff for explanation"}
{"text":"Oh, dear. Another AYCE sushi dump. And that's generous. The details:

*Server/Host/Robot \"Ben\" led me to my table and while blocking my entrance to the booth, asked me what I wanted to drink. While I was standing up. In my fully buttoned coat. With my gloves still on and purse on shoulder. 

*Music: an incoherent mashup of a techno/rave song, followed by \"Thinking Out Loud\" by Ed Sheeran, followed by a rap song we couldn't identify. Repeat. Yup--same 3 songs for 1.5 hours.

*As food runners dropped off food, and I said, \"thank you\", there was no reply. No acknowledgement. If you dared to ask for something, they were already 2 tables past.

*Cocktail shrimp (yes, I ordered this at a sushi place) but no cocktail sauce. Who can eat those bland things naked?

*Dim Sum: available. Dim Sum trio of sauces? Not.

*My partner's beer ($8), as it neared half, was noticed a few times. Server missed no opportunity to ask if he wanted another. My water ($0) glass, as it neared bone dry, was ignored. Had to ask for more water several times. 

*An order of tempura shrimp: 1 piece. An order of rice: a bowl that could serve 4.

*Chicken Curry was...not chicken. You know that crappy chicken they put in canned soup? Like, it's scarily glued together and fatty and weird? Well, whatever bits didn't make the cut for ol' chicken noodle found their way into K & B's Chicken Curry.

*Chicken Teriyaki: see above.

*Chicken Fried Rice: see above. However it looked good.

*Not once did a server come by and ask if we needed anything. Not once. Could barely find one to flag down. However, toward the end of the meal, one lone girl parked herself about 8 feet from our table and proceeded to stare at us as we ate--no hyperbole. It was rude and it was awkward and it was just creepy. I finally stared back. And she looked away. Then looked back and looked away. Then looked back and I said to her that I felt like we were being watched. Are you watching us? \"Take your time, but you're the last table in here.\" I don't even think it was their closing time yet.

*Shockingly, Cakebread Cellars Sauv Blanc was on their wine list. 

*\"Ben\" argued with us about how to place an order, haha.

*Crispy salmon roll was the opposite of crispy. I suspect that when they do their dinner prep in the afternoon, they get the salmon together, mix it with tempura flakes, and cover the bowl. So when you order your crispy roll at 8pm, it's stuffed with an oily, soggy, salmon-tempura oatmeal.

*One time, a server, presumably on her way out to have a dart, dropped off food in her long, zippered, winter coat. 

*Sashimi: first order of salmon was cut just fine. Second order of tuna was atrocious. If you like your sashimi as a cube-ish trapezoid, you're in luck. Just horrible and a disgrace.

*To add insult to injury, the washroom had a dry, crusty, poop spray/splatter across the back wall by the toilet. Of course this isn't K&B's fault. But if they had staff checking the washroom throughout the evening, I doubt I would have seen it.

*The pi√®ce de r√©sistance: There's no explanation of the maki rolls on the menu but there are full colour, high res images of each. The names don't tell you what's inside so we asked a server (who was actually quite pleasant). There were about 10-12 rolls that had tempura shrimp inside but the other ingredients were unclear. We knew it had shrimp tempura because the shrimp tails were proudly sprouting out of the end pieces. This is when we learned from that helpful server that all of those rolls with the shrimp tempura are actually stuffed with imitation crab meat and the shrimp tail is merely a decoration! He said that maybe one or two pieces in the roll will have a bit of shrimp but that's just for show. 

It's almost like they're trying to suck at being a restaurant. I just hated everything about this place."}
{"text":"Poor service, the servers could use some smiles and common courtesy. Sushi is fast food grade but premium price. Once and never again!"}
{"text":"Oh KB, why must you be another sushi AYCE spot to disappoint?!
 
At first this was a jewel Oh my gosh! I had just moved to the area and was on the hunt for another go to AYCE sushi spot for those nights I binge watched an anime and had a sudden craving for sushi.  The sushi was fresh and the rice was just right. The menu selection was impressive too. The d√©cor is modern and comfortable. Suitable for date night or even a family gathering. The customer service was also fast, but not very friendly- I do not like the way they just drop your order on the table and run away.
 
Don't get me wrong all these attributes about the restaurant is still the same. The only changes that has come to disappoint me is they raised the prices and the quality is noticeable lower. I guess this happens sometimes when a restaurant gets popular.  
 
I'm a regular here and I always kept forgetting to review KB Sushi. A month ago I'd give this place an easy 4 star. After my last two visits my decision changed.
 
At my last visit I found a long black hair in my Rainbow maki roll. EW!
I told the server and she just laughed about it LOL yikes!
 
My AYCE sushi hunt continues. Anyone have any recommendation in the Etobicoke area?"}
{"text":"I was on the fence about giving 3 or 4 stars, but I went with 4 because of the iPads. They are a pretty slick way to order when you get the hang of them. I like K&B more than Spoon and Fork across the street because of the iPads and the food, and it is a welcome change from going to Mandarin. 
There is plenty of parking out back. I didn't recognize the place when I walked in as I went to the Brawley once, quickly.
The food was on the whole good for an AYCE venue. Portions were standard size but everything was fresh. The hot dishes came quickly.
We were stuffed by dessert, so not sure what that was like.
Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"All you can eat menu here is very good! A lot of variety and great quality. Definitely order the salmon sashimi, Kalbi, ocean roll and red/green dragon roll. Service is not great, hella sassy and bad attitude. Go at lunch, only $15 for ayce!"}
{"text":"I wasn't really impressed by K&B sushi, it's alright. I came here for dinner with my boyfriend and my aunt and I probably wouldn't visit it again.
I didn't loveee any of the rolls there.
The salmon on the sushi was thin and there was a lot of rice. 
There was scallop sashimi here which was really neat, I've never tried it before, but in all honesty, everything tasted a little bland to me.

The best things there were their soups and the red bean ice cream. It didn't have any freezer burn, it was delicious, and I actually ate the beans in this one! 
The ipad ordering was neat and the service was good. Not my favourite all you can eat place though."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening. Found the service to be really slow took awhile to get the food or service.  The weirdest thing is after you order your food from an Ipad a server has to go there to approve your order.  Ive been to other AYCE buffets and this a first where they they have to approve your order before it is served and sometimes it may take them 5-15 mins for them to come to your table and approve.  Seems like a dumb company auditing system structure theybhave adopted for food ordering.  If i want that to happen i can just order food at work and hope my company approves my expense report after for reimbursement.  The food was okay some of my orders were not met surprisingly especially after youre paying 28+taxes per person you would think it will better service.  I would go to other AYCe that know what theyre doing before you go here.  Ive been to the other location on Winston Churchill and they were 10x better which is why i brought my friends and family to this location. not sure why this place is slacking.  In the end it was 30-40 ?mins of eating and 1.5hrs of waiting and waiting......even getting the bill and paying was a long wait"}
{"text":"I come here quite often, the menu selection is great and the sushi is always fresh. Though I adore the use of tablets and the a la carte  ordering style, I have quite a few problems with the service. The restaurant is always very dark and the music too loud to hold a conversation. The servers look constantly exhausted and fed up, which I guess is understandable with the angry intensity that seems to posses the falsely friendly manager. I came here once with a large group of friends, apparently our tip didn't seem to satisfy the waitress as she openly addressed a friend of mine and demanded that tipping largely is polite with a large group of people, does she not realize that a group of students can't afford to give her an extra $10 for scowling at us and forgetting our Miso soup?"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place when it was just Crazy Sushi. I was hesitant to go when I did with my boyfriend because AYCE sushi places are generally a hit or miss; I'd say this place is somewhere in between. 

We went there on a Thursday night & it was quite busy. Even though they are AYCE they still offer an a la carte menu. They were patient enough to let is look over the a la carte menu when deciding which we'd go with. The a la carte menu seems limited, which I guess means they really want to push for the AYCE. We went with AYCE & we ordered off iPads which I think is now clich√© with new AYCE sushi places. I was surprised at how attentive our waitress was.

The teppanyaki dishes were alright, the beefs were slightly overdone. The chicken teriyaki was impressive. The regular tempuras were good, I like how they offer things like broccoli or eggplant tempura & not just the regular shrimp & yam tempura. 

I was slightly disappointed in their rolls. Their spicy salmon seem to be the only maki roll that impressed me. Their sashimi was a little inconsistent. There were pieces that looked & tasted fresh & others that looked a little older & not so fresh.

The banana tempura for dessert was really good & their ice cream tasted better than most places. 

The bill came to around $50 for the both of us which wasn't a surprise. Just a heads up: they give a 10% discounts if you're paying by cash."}
{"text":"Pretty sure something I had for dinner gave me food poisoning. I had wanton soup, shitake roll, yam tempura roll, tamago (looks like egg sashimi), seaweed salad, and miso soup. I shared this with my friend who also had broccoli and crab salad, sweet and sour soup, a grilled eggplant dish, and a grilled shitake mushroom dish. He stopped eating after the soups because he felt like the food \"was just sitting and not digesting\" where as I finished almost everything but the seaweed salad. I felt like the food was fine, but about 6 hours later I had dry heaving and diarrhea. It may have been the quantity of the food or the food itself, but my friend woke up with extreme nausea so I'm assuming it's  the food. I'm giving this a higher rating than I probably should only because I've eaten here two times before without issue (although the sushi didn't taste very fresh) but I probably won't eat here again. Sorry for describing the foods and not knowing the actual names, I'm having issues remembering probably because I have a low fever."}
{"text":"High expectations. Maybe too high after loving Heart Sushi in Heartland.
K&B was nice looking but an unusual IPAD process where the staff had to send the order to the kitchen after you filled in your selection... every time!
Most of the food was good. Some was a bit too greasy and more than expected was over cooked. None of my table mates had been to Heart Sushi, but will now go to see that not All You Can Eat Sushi r
estaurants, are the same.
Maybe it was just a bad night for K&B. It happens!"}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty sushi. Service was very good. The nice thing about ordering on the iPads is that you can view your order anytime to see what you have and have not been served yet."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place a lot and actually liked it but today I went and the customer service was horrible. DO NOT ORDER FROM SKIP THE DISHES BECAUSE they don't hold up to the same menu on there as in store and then they tell YOU TO CALL SKIP THE DISHES AND COMPLAIN. Also this time rolls were crap

I will NEVER come back. I will stick to Sushi 4 U across the street with fresh sushi and amazing service!"}
{"text":"Been to many AYCE sushi places and this one is a favourite. This place is much better prices than Spoon & Fork across the street. I find they also have way better customer service and a great selection."}
{"text":"One of the nicer sushi places around here, regardless of you ordering a la carte or go AYCE"}
{"text":"walking into this restaurant knowing its an all you can eat, but not realizing how fancy the place is inside.

Its like a hidden gem, yet not so hidden. you drive by and see this sign for K&B sushi, and you think oh yeah okay, basic all you can eat sushi. NOPE, definitely not basic. 

It seems this place would be great for birthday parties, or like a reception of some sort. quite classy if you ask me. 

The food was good, and the service was exceptional. I don't normally order the udon at all you can eat sushi places because it can be a hit or miss, and K&B the udon was a definite HIT!

I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This is our go-to for sushi. Great service, and great food. Food comes out in a timely manner and it has never disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible.. Came here for lunch..we got seated right beside the entrance and we were freezing! We asked to move and the server gave us so much attitude. We then ordered a bunch of things (I really only liked the dynamite hand roll, everything was bland) and when it came it out, it had that eel sauce(we asked what it was and we couldnt understand what our server said) on it although it did not have it ontop within the picture on the ipad menu. We requested TWICE  to order another dynamite roll without it to the same server and no one ever came back with it. Mind you, it was not that busy and all of our other food items came out fairly quick.We asked to speak to a manager about our situation (we were not pleased with waiting) and he did not care and took away all of our food items off our table ........... it was quite awkward and pretty rude. All we wanted was a damn dynamite roll w no sauce and we simply explained how long we were waiting.. He seemed offended which is not how a manager should present himself.  Service is not good and food is even worse in my opinion. To me everything tasted as if it had been sitting out for a long time like the kalbi ribs, or rice. Neverrrrrr coming back!! This was not my first time either. Every experience just kept going downhill. Really dont understand the hype. Sticking to Sehmi Sushi just down the road :)"}
{"text":"I will never return to k and b. I found rotten avacados hidden in my handroll. Advised the manager of my findings and he did nothing. Asked if i wanted a different roll. No, i dont want a different roll. My appetite is now gone. He left and never returned. I then had to ask another server for the bill, as no one returned to our table. This place is a complete joke. Raging, to say the least!"}
{"text":"This is not All You Can Eat Buffet!!!
Certain sashimi like red tuna you can only have 2pieces each person!!!!! I wanted more so I ordered and manger comes and she said that we can only have 2 pieces each then deleted my order and left!!!! Not worth of money!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Another day, another AYCE sushi restaurant. 
It is pretty similar to the others out there, but definitely on the better end in terms of service and quality.
It has the iPad's to order and ask for the bill, which is convenient. I'd say if you go in a group bigger than 4 people, you may want to stagger your orders as the food comes out super fast! 
The waitress was great about taking my order separately and ensuring it was on its own plate so that there was no cross contamination. I don't think they had gluten free soy sauce (I brought my own so I didn't need to ask), but most don't because of the much higher price point. 
I can't speak to the fish as I primarily eat veggie sushi. The only fish I had was the shrimp dumplings and they were great! 
The edamame comes in a huge bowl- big enough for two I'd say, and the desserts are slightly larger than the other AYCE sushi restaurants I've been to. 
Nice decor and the service was pretty fantastic. Never had to ask for water or green tea refills and the plates were always whisked away as soon as we were done. I think I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've heard such great things about KB so my expectations were high, it was a birthday dinner so i was really excited to finally try it out. The service we received was horrible, only saw our waitress once when we came in and practically had to hunt her down to order our food. The food was the biggest disappointment, we ordered a variety and majority of the dishes such as the beef dishes were cold and dry. Not a single dish tasted fresh and the $30 something dollar bill for the cold food and cold service was the icing on the cake. Will never be retutning."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times for lunch and thought the food was decent. The service was quick with bringing food and clearing plates. The drink specials are cheap if you want to imbibe a bit. 
The main thing that brought me back here were the steamed custard buns, they were so soft and sweet! The main issue with this place is that I noticed was that the freshness of the ingredients just wasn't up to snuff for the price of the meal. I would probably skip K&B even if I do miss out on the steamed custard buns."}
{"text":"This is the
Most disrespectful place. Food was 3/10. Very overpriced. 

Server BEN and Manager Raymond can provide you the
Most delightfully disgusting behave and services (just cuz we wanted to return our Soup which was smelling as pig intestines, on top we offered to pay for the soup from AYCE menu)
you can ever imagine In food industry. We just finished our food ASAP and left."}
{"text":"Best sashimi ever, super thick and buttery. Everything on the menu...which is on an ipad btw!!!, is incedible. I've been here 3 times since it opened, once with a party of 15 and the service was great every time. A little slow at first with the big group but it picked up quickly, everyone had a great time, almost had to be rolled out of the place because of munching all the delicious foods ^_^"}
{"text":"Even tho their dinner buffet says AYCE, however upon placing order on the iPads like many times before we were informed now scallops and tuna sashimi are no longer AYCE But 2 order per person! When asked if this was their new policy, the waitstaff said it has always been this way even tho we were there just a month ago and I had pictures to prove the multiple orders we had! 
I loved how they had sweet shrimp and scallops but since it isn't AYCE , they should not be on the menu! Maybe put a sign up on each table! It's false advertising to promote all you can eat but have certain items be limited! What's the point then? 
I had really like this place coz it's close to work but will think twice no before going again!"}
{"text":"Really like this place! Modern decor, clean, good service, iPad makes ordering clear and organized. We did lunch ayce on a Saturday and they were busy near full but food still came steadily and got everything we ordered. Really appreciate for an ayce sushi place, that the rolls had a good amount of fish to small portion of rice because many places have so much filler or you can't even tell where the fish is. Would go there again and recommend to friends"}
{"text":"went here on a sunday night for my cousins' bdays. we had reserve a table for 8 so waiting wasn't a problem. I had been looking forward to eating here for the ayce portion of both sushi and kitchen items

i was fairly disappointed. the sashimi (tuna, salmon, octopus, butter fish) were very fishy and i thought it was just a fluke but when i ordered a few more, they were also fishy as well

the good thing is that they have plenty of kitchen + dim sum items. the bad thing is that they weren't that tasty. the sui mai had no flavour, the beef ribs were dry, the salmon teriyaki was overcooked, the fried udon was too sweet, the dumplings were bland, etc

i really enjoyed fried squid however. it was crunchy and had a good flavour to it. my most favourite item here was the coconut ice cream! strong coconut flavour and very rich and creamy"}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere, and good food. As far as AYCE sushi in Etobicoke goes, there isn't much competition. The food comes out really fast which is a nice touch of you're in a rush to get to the movies or of you're just really, really hungry. They have a wide selection of food as well which is great. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good AYCE in Etobicoke."}
{"text":"Best exploratory sushi experience ever. 
Fresh made, tasty, wide selection, fun ordering on iPad with pictures. 
I ate there alone on a business trip. Lots of groups were there. Fun to share and explore. 
Great selection beyond sushi of Chinese and Japanese dishes. Deserts and drinks were part of the menu. 
I will definitely be returning on my next visit to the Toronto area."}
{"text":"I've always liked the food here, though it's never been super fresh. The staff are horrible; one waitress screamed at me because she forgot to tell the sushi chefs that I didn't want eel sauce over my roll and yelled at me for not wanting to eat it the way I specifically asked for it to not be made. The manager and another waiter have spoken in their language and made it obvious they were talking about us, laughing and pointing and staring. They've now started to force us to tip, demanding 15% as they put our cards into the machines and type it in, and won't take no for an answer. I HATE this place. I'm trying to find a new sushi spot because the staff here are horrendous."}
{"text":"When this place first opened they were SO good!! Sushi was super fresh and the hot food/ dim sum was great. However when I returned back here after a few months it went so downhill. Almost every single roll had so much cucumber! Avocado was very brown and the fish did not taste fresh AT ALL.
The hot food was also very subpar. 
Save your money and go else where."}
{"text":"this is going to be my new sushi place. i dont know how it could get any better! its gorgeous!
the food was delicious, ambiance was really warm and nice, waiters were attentive and always walking around  making sure everything was okay. they also have a patio! feel sad i didnt make it here in the summer. 

they have a large menu with dim sum items, Thai items, Chinese items, and much more. 

we ordered salmon sashimi, steak teriyaki (maybe a tad overcooked), tofu teriyaki, veggie pizza, green dragon roll, red dragon roll, tom yum soup (maybe pass on this it was salty), sweet n sour soup, avocado salad and mango salad, spicy salmon roll, shrimp and veggie tempura, deep fried milk, and ice cream. they also had $4 sapporo pint specials mon to thurs

will definitely return. dinner price was normal for ayce about 30 each with tax in i think"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice. One midday on a weekday and once dinner time on a weekend. 
The tablet ordering was nice because we could order as slow or fast as we wanted.
They have a large variety of foods. Brought a friend who didn't like seafood and she still has a large amount of options and filling meal. 
Both times they've had strawberry roll and kiwi roll on the menu and I've been disappointed that they haven't had it available. 
Strawberry ice cream tastes like real strawberries and they have deep fried milk and banana both to go with your dessert.

That being said we waited a while for a roll that wasn't coming, we asked the waitress and she checked and came back saying it should be out shortly. Then it had been an hour since we ordered it so I lost hope and accepted the fact I'd never get my mountain roll.

Dinner for 2 (with ice tea) with 15% tip was 84 dollars. Which is a little steep."}
{"text":"I came back yesterday for the second time after my friend kept raving about much the food has improved. Tbh I didn't really enjoy the first visit as I found the food to not be fresh at all, especially the sashimi. 

I decided to give K&B another go and went on a Sunday afternoon around 3 PM with my boyfriend. It was super busy, which is a good sign ! We were seated after about a 10 minute wait. The girl who brought us to our table and brought us our drinks ...and that was probably the last we've seen of her until the end. 

The food did improve, I'll give it that but service wise it seems to have gone down since my first visit. However it was a really busy night so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for a minute. 

I strongly recommend K&B consider having guests be able to send in their orders themselves, especially in a crowded night because I had to wait 15 minutes to get my order sent in. Not only that, but while waiting we tagged down a girl server who just finished delivering all the food on her tray to the tables and she literally waved us off? She just walked away and didn't even return or send anyone else. If she had some food left to bring out then I'd understand but she had an empty tray and it takes no more than 30 seconds to send in orders... also, when our food did come out, the food with sauce like the gyoza ... the sauce was spilled all over the plate and the gyoza got all soggy like wtf? At least make sure the food is presentable, I don't care how busy it is. This has NEVER happened to any other AYCE sushi restaurants I've been too, and this place is more pricey then most. If I'm going to pay more for AYCE, I expect service to be up to par or even better. 

There was this one male server who was absolutely fantastic ! He helped us move to a bigger table, helped every other table as much as he can and he's the one who sent our orders in most of the time. I also noticed that he would stop what he was doing if he saw customers needing help sending their orders in ... something the girl serve we flagged down should take note of. 

Food is pretty great, but it'd be awesome if they give mayo for the karaage... anyways food is 4/5. Service is 3/5... I would put 1.5 but the male server is just too awesome. They need to find more servers like him. 

Still debating if I want to go back. I'll go back when I feel like waiting for 15 minutes for orders to be sent, to be waved off by a server and have food come out soggy because the sauce spilled everywhere on the plate!!"}
{"text":"After I picked up my best friend from the airport we decided to grab a bite to eat. We spotted this ayce sushi spot and thought perfect ALL YOU CAN EAT. As soon as we walked in we noticed how spacious this location was. It's huge and surprisingly packed midafternoon. The d√©cor was a bit more modern then most ayce, they had ipad menus (which I was really excited to use).  The sushi was good I have no complaints. Two things that stood out for me was the white tuna nigiri. They sprinkle it with fresh cracked black pepper! SO GOOD! Also, I think the fact that you could order shrimp tempura with no veggies! A lot of places say it comes pre packed with the veggies so you have to order them as well. My friend and I always hide them under napkins so that was nice. Overall they have a good amount of selection, quick service and they are clean. I will def drop by again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I went to this place for lunch. I honestly expected it (from other people I know) to be disappointing but it wasn't!!!! 
The last time I was in this place was when it was The Hollywood. It's complelty changed inside and looks amaxing. 
The waitress was so nice and explained how to order through the IPad which I truly enjoyed using. There's so many different things to order surely  something for everyone. 
The food was fresh and hot, I would definatly suggest the crispy roll and the beef roll with green onion. 
The price isn't bad for the food which is 18.99 for the lunch special."}
{"text":"Love this place I been there 4 time and I leave with a smile on my face and satisfied customers"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend that recommended it. But we both were pretty disappointed with his most recent visit; and my first. To start, the miso soup was extremely salty. It wasn't very enjoyable. The rolls were average, but were prone to falling apart as the rice wasn't as sticky as you'd expect it to be. For the sushi, the fish to rice ratio was horrible, with a thin sliver of fish for each ball of rice. You could see the rice through the fish portion. The sashimi portions were proper. We ordered a few items from the BBQ, and the garlic beef was delicious. However the BBQ ribs weren't the greatest. Very thin and filled with fat. The Beef sashimi, which is just supposed to be lightly seared on the outside was nearly thoroughly cooked, although seasoned nicely.

Overall the service was good and enjoyable sashimi and garlic beef saved this from being a one star rating. Moon Sushi isn't to far away, and is about $2/person cheaper. Next time I will be going there instead."}
{"text":"VERY different experience than everyone else. Party of 10, not one of us will set foot in there again. 

Ordering off the AYCE menu, we made it clear that due to my dietary issues, my rolls HAD to be on a different plate. My order included the salmon tempura roll, which Kris, our waitress, verified and then went into the kitchen to stress to the staff there.

When my order arrived, delivered by a different server, it was on a platter with two others. They didn't identify them, just dropped them at the far end of the table. Since so many different things had been ordered and everyone knew my food was coming separately, they were eaten before we realized the mix-up.

The manager jumped in and assured me the rolls would come again, on a separate plate (they did). While I had him, I asked about the Spring Rolls and veggie tempura I'd ordered 30 minutes earlier; he said they would be \"right out.\" I waited 10 minutes and asked again, and he snapped they take a little while but would be right out.

20 minutes later, I asked our original waitress (we being a party of 10 were getting food delivered by everyone) *again* for my Spring Rolls. She was horrified and ran to the kitchen to get them and the tempura. Which I ate while my party had dessert!

When I finally got to eat my ice cream, I almost swallowed a piece of rubbery plastic. The manager tried to convince us it was a piece of cabbage and just forget it.

My tablemates suggested based on the fact it took me over an hour to get food and that everything had to be ordered one to three times, that I got fed when everyone else was done, and when I finally got to my ice cream it was adulterated, my meal be comped. He said he couldn't do that and insisted all the problems had been fixed (he kept focusing on the replacement Salmon Tempura rolls and shrugging off or even denying our having to order the Spring Rolls three times).

When we insisted, he offered 15 per cent. Not to the table, to me.  So, $3.75 off a $25 meal in which I barely ate after watching the group around me eat for an hour and that ended with plastic in my food.

Although moments earlier he'd said HE was the boss, he now said he'd have to go talk to the boss when we said that was insufficient. He came back moments later and said he could go as high as 20% off. 

Frankly, I was stunned. In general in my experience, the customer service at Japanese restaurants is some of the best around. We weren't asking for a comp for all 10 of us, but a minimum half off for the person whose entire experience was farcical.  

Two people of our group ate there regularly; for the price of the $12.50 that would have been a good gesture of customer service, they've lost potentially thousands in revenue from visits by those two and their guests. 

If you have ANY sort of special request, just don't go there. If you do, ask for Kris as your waitress - she was the one shining note in the entire farce, she's great."}
{"text":"Had a great experience with the AYCE at KB a few weeks ago. The iPad ordering system made it super fun, and great that you can see what the food looks like before you order it. They had fresh sashimi, and even had amaebi (raw shrimp) on the menu! Their Thai food selection was not bad either, their curries could use a bit more sauce though, and maybe paired with rice. Their tom yum soup could use more punch. Overall it was a bit pricier than other AYCE Japanese places in Toronto, but you get what you pay for - better quality, more selection and a nice ambience!"}
{"text":"Oops! Thought I wrote a review for K&B Sushi before, seeing that I frequent this AYCE restaurant. This is our go-to sushi lunch buffet spot - has iPad ordering system, quick service, large variety of sushi, hand rolls and specialty rolls, trendy interior and comfy seats. All the food come out piping hot, our favourites are the deep fried California roll, salmon hand roll (there's not much rice inside), deep fried wonton with cream cheese filling, the staples like miso soup, crabmeat broccoli salad, seaweed salad and crunchy tempura. The staff is friendly and the food is delivered to the table promptly with no mix up from the kitchen (don't you hate it when your Korean ribs end up going to the table beside you?!). I've tried most (if not all) sushi buffets in Mississauga and by far, this is my favourite place!!"}
{"text":"The best thing about our meal was the company (which is a good thing, because it was a first date!) And getting to use a tablet to order, which I hadn't done before! 

The food was less than average.   The tempura shrimp was almost cold, clearly fried in advance.  The garlic beef had no garlic flavour at all.   The beef and enoki roll didn't have enough beef, and not much flavour.   The sashimi and sushi were okay!  They do slice the salmon nice and thick. 

The yam tempura was very good.   The mango salad was very good.   But really, you don't go to a Japanese restaurant for mango salad, 

They don't take reservations on the weekends, which I think they should.  It was very busy Saturday night at 7."}
{"text":"I was really surprised to see the best AYCE sushi in GTA turned into one of the worst, within 6 months while I was out of town. Looks like they have changed management sometime during 2015, and food quality went down dramatically. I would not. recommend it anymore."}
{"text":"This place has decent food for its price and it's pretty good for the area it is in. 

The service is horrible tho omg.  The lady that was serving us was the most impatient lady of all time, you could see she was pissed.

Tip: order everything you want at the beginning because they take a very long time to come back around to where you are..."}
{"text":"Came here with a gym buddy after working out at a nearby  gym.   Having been to the Winston   location   i noticed that some menu items were different but not an issue at all. The vibe is very welcoming and the ordering is made simple via the use of ipad.  The sushi is fresh and   we went for lots of rice based rolls  and sashimi since we were really hungry.  Give this place a try"}
{"text":"Long overdue review . As a sushi fan I   try   different sushi places with various groups of friends. . K& B  service is efficient.  Since  we come for the ayce sushi good service for me is the bills being separated with no issue,  food brought  on time, and  certain dietary adjustments made. If those are done I am happy . The food is up there with most sushi  places. The meat is soft , the rice is not hard  and  the  dining experience  is welcoming.   My advice is to go on a slow day so your food will come faster than on a busy  day where u might have to wait a little bit more. Its a nice place for sushi after a movie at the nearby  movie theatre"}
{"text":"K & B Sushi

. . . does not stand for King of Burgers Sushi,  as my gf was trying to convince me. 

I give this place 4 stars. I was definitely impressed at first sight walking in. The restaurant is big and looks very Asian modern inside. It's fancy and also very spacious which I like. Furthermore, every order is made using iPads! Each table has it's own iPad and you scroll through all the menu choices and check off what you want to order. Then you click a button and a server instantly comes to process your order. And when I say \"instantly\", I mean instantly. Literally less than 30 seconds after we ordered a server came by, each time! We were getting a little suspicious, like do they have chips implanted in their brains or something? How do they know so fast?  

But needless to say, their service was great! The quality of the sushi itself was good, typical ayce quality. I enjoyed it. Their seaweed salad was really good; it wasn't doused with dressing like most seaweed salads. I recommend their \"Red Dragon Rolls\". The dessert was really good too. I don't know why, but their ice cream tasted better than most ayce sushi ice creams. And their deep fried banana was delicious as well (could use more chocolate sauce though).

All in all I enjoyed this place. I would come here again."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars. Absolutely disgusting we found a piece of COCKROACH cooked in the crab cheese wonton. so gross."}
{"text":"Had a group event last night. Service was amazing. Staff were friendly and fast with our requests. Food was good. I love that they also have some Dim Sum options. I recommend this place if you are in the area and craving sushi."}
{"text":"K&B Sushi is a sit-down buffet style restaurant, where for an all-inclusive price, you can order as many dishes as you want. In addition to the large variety of sushi, they do have other Japanese options as well. 

We both enjoyed the sushi here - it is done very well. We also tried a couple of their teriyaki dishes which were good as well.

I particularly enjoyed their sushi pizza. I know it sounds bizarre, but it is very good. It's also the first time that I've tried butterfish. It doesn't taste like butter so much, but has the softness of it."}
{"text":"In a word, underwhelming.  Service was pretty careless although fast.  Waitresses were just throwing the food on the table and rushing us to clear plates so they could take them away... like calm down.  And no one asked how the meal was going, they were just getting people in and out.  The food was just mediocre compared to other all-you-can-eat sushi places I've been to, and it was just so loud in there I could barely hear myself think, let alone speak to my family without yelling."}
{"text":"If I could sum up K&B Sushi in one word, it would be: regret. But NOT because the food and service were bad. On the contrary, the food was fantastic, and I could not believe that it was all you could eat for $30. I mean, we're talking quality sushi, all you can eat, for $30. You cannot go wrong with this place.

And that's where the regret comes from. The dietary and caloric decisions I made here would not make my primary care provider happy. Between the six of us, we ate 124 items. And I was told that was a low number. 10,000 calories is attainable here.

If you're on a strict diet, you've been warned lol."}
{"text":"I went to K&B because I was told it was very good and so I gave it a try and I also live in the area . I went in and it was very nice we sat down and I  asked a takeout menu wanting to take it for later if 4he food was good.We order off the ipad  a few seconds later a sushi pizza came to the table. but we did not order it my son stuck his finger on the top and I asked the staff to leave the pizza and I don't know if he did not hear me but he left with the pizza and l saw him serve  the pizza to aother table. W e found a curly hair in our food I have straight hair .The  sashimi was chewy in the hand roll . and our sever was rude when my husband asked for a la a cart menu because he did not want the buffet.  I got home and tossed the take out menu will not be going there ever again which is sad because I live in the area and I eat out a lot"}
{"text":"This is my family's go to place for Japanese buffet. Clean but always busy so not somewhere to eat and relax. I often feel rushed. We've tried many places in our area but they seem to love this place the most. The kids love it as it's easy to order with pictures of all the items on the menu. Great for people unfamiliar with Japanese food as you order on an ipad. Service is fast and consistent. Food quality has been consistent as well. They just lack a few items I love like salmon belly."}
{"text":"So far one of the best AYCE Sushi with more options then any other places and same price as other places so it's my new sushi spot and the decor and place is very chilled and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Didn't make reservations but still
got a table for 6 within a decent time.

iPad was a little glitchy, so our first order was unknowingly unsent. Third order had some tech issues but were resolved quickly.

Better quality food than typical all-u-can-eat restos.

I would eat here again!"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I love food and probably eat Japanese food once a week. We go to this plaza for movies so thought we try out this restaurant.

Horrible food. Cool ordering system though. 26$ for ayce w extra for drinks. 

We ordered once and didnt order more. 5 of the dishes that we tried were so bad so we asked for ice cream and didnt finish the other dishes.

Waiter instead of asking how the food were and whether we liked it, threatened to charge us for left overs. So I was honest and told her I would freaking eat more if the food was better. Instead of apologizing she said okay this time no charge for leftovers but just bill.

The dim sum dumpling was soggy and had the worlds tiniest shrimps. The sashimi was just okay. The yaki udon tasted like sweaty socks. 

Would not go back. This restaurant would not last a day anywhere else in GTA...but limited options in Oakville I guess. 

Oh yah on a weekend most Japanese restaurant teppanyaki will be packed and this one was empty. Says a lot!"}
{"text":"This ayce sushi place definitely satisfies my sushi craving when I go. My friend and I went for lunch around 12:30PM and it wasn't too busy actually. We were seated right away and our waitress got our drink orders quite promptly.

My friend and I got a good variety of sushi and different rolls as well as the kalbi short ribs. The short ribs were somewhat on the fattier side but still pretty good. The rolls had a thin layer of rice and a good amount of filling. They were able to get us everything we ordered which was great.

The service was great and very attentive which I quite liked. I'll definitely be coming back here if I am in the mood for sushi and in the area."}
{"text":"We were looking for good AYCE sushi in Mississauga... and so the choices are eyes-rolling limited. But for the sushi fix, sometimes it's okay.

Well, this time. For a special friend's birthday, NO it was NOT okay to go to lousy Yang's or 168! So I decided to travel a little far for K&B (which is in the AMC plaza, with Putting Edge and all..)

The four of us were seated (with reservation! Very fancy!) in the corner and it was soooo intimate, I loved it. The decor and atmosphere here is very nice and perfect for birthday or other special occasions.

The waiters and even the manager (the glasses guy looked like a manager) were mind-blowingly friendly! Wow, really!!? They were just smiling and smiling and very attentive (except this one girl, but whatever). They were always checking on us, in case we wanted more ginger or soy sauce or spicy mayo on the side.. or more drinks.

AYCE dinner includes all you can drink pop $24.95/per person
BONUS for kids 2-4yr $4!! 
And 4-12yr $14
DOUBLE BONUS for IPAD** MENU + ORDERING.

WOW their menu is extensive and the photos make everything SOOOO easy to order! HOWEVER it doesn't tell you what's in the roll.. especially when they have Red Dragon, Green Dragon, Black Dragon, Volcano, Rock & Roll, Philadelphia, Osaka, Tokyo, Boston.... The photos don't quite help. 

TRIPLE bonus for \"sweet & sour\" soup!!! Not Asian-approved, but a good fix like an AYCE sushi fix.

Sashimi was pretty good! And yes they have butter fish!! 

QUADRUPLE bonus for the amazing drinks menu!!! Japanese beers, red and white wine, cocktail and martini, whiskey and scotch! (Not AYCE lol)

So for AYCE SUSHI, you KNOW this isn't the BEST quality but K&B serves surprisingly GOOD**** stuff (plus the amazing service we received on a late Sunday night. We were the last table to leave.....but they were still very friendly to us \"gotta wait for them to finish their friggin food\" customers), I totally think this place deserves 5 stars!


P.S. They have a teppanyaki area!!!!!!!!!! AND YES they offer A-La-Carte menu. There's so much they offer!!!! They need to move to Square One area.


**No, guys, I KNOW it's not an iPad. But TABLET MENU sounds like something from a caveman!

****Yes, there are some that aren't so good! What is with that soft-shelled crab sushi? And that Spicy Butterfish Handroll was awful!"}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer to this place.. I always bring my parents and relatives here for dinner whoever's birthday and me and my husband came here all the time for regular dinner AYCE. However, we were in such huge disappointment this time.
First of all, my favourite dish the pepper beef turnt really bad and so we told the server and hopefully they would find out what went wrong and prevent other customers from having the same bad beef dish we had. Then, the sashimi dish was very not fresh (trust me, I travel to Japan a lot and I can tell what is fresh sashimi and what's not) so we told the waitress again and hope she would let the kitchen know. Then, a middle-age man who wore suits and I'm assuming he was the manager, came to our table and said he assured the sashimi was fresh and if we didn't want any of the dish we ordered, we should have told them right away instead of telling them the food turnt bad. Like seriously????????!!!! He is accusing us for lying about the food quality just because we didn't want to finish them!?!? And after 10 minutes, he purposely dumped the plate of sashimi on our table and said\"see it's new and fresh\" and then picked it up and delivered to another table... like what the heck!?
I got really mad because I have been a loyal customer since day one and referred a lot of my friends to their restaurant! I told them the problems so that they aware and hopefully to improve their business! (never see full tables at their Mississauga location) I am so mad that the male manager had such bad managing skills.. from day one when we visited the restaurant at the Etobicoke location, he would only talk to the older ppl (like my parents) and never talk to young ppl like us (at our 30s) or look into our eyes for once..not to mention we pay the bills all the time... 
Seriously, give your business to somewhere else where it deserves! If you are young and non-white, run when you see the manager...."}
