{"text":"Five stars for the location and value, three stars for the property itself.  The building is in a great location, it's on a side street, so its relatively quiet, but 1/2 a block from a busy street with a bus line, and a few blocks from a subway.  You can walk to McGill, Mont Royal Park, and all over downtown.  For three nights we paid just over $300, and that included breakfast (coffee, juice, pastries, cereal), and wifi (we didn't have to log in - we could use our iPads with no problem).    We couldn't find a better price for the location unless we went the hostel route.

The property is a lovely house, if you have a problem with stairs, this will be tough for you.  we were on the first floor, but we had to walk up a few stairs, through a door, then down some stairs to our room, and our bathtub was sort of in this closet where you walked up 3 steps to step down into the tub.  No problem for us, but for folks who do not do stairs, this is tough.  our room was huge - comfy bed, flat screen TV, nice bathroom with really great-smelling soap/shampoo.   The carpet was a little dingy, and there were lots of \"old house\" sounds - and the plumbing for our shower was really loud for the person still in bed.  The area outside our room had an odd smell too.  Minor things, really, but sometimes a little annoying.  The staff was really nice as well, and answered a few pre-stay Internet questions.  I would for sure stay here again if I'm ever in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our stay at Manoir Ambrose. Great location, free Wi-Fi, comfortable beds, warm rooms, great complimentary breakfast with outstanding coffee, nice TVs, excellent rates, etc."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Has a lot of character, and unlike most venues with the older/rustic vibe, it was also very clean. The rooms were quiet and you could not hear any noise from outside or from other rooms -- a real rarity downtown. It was an excellent location as it was walking distance from almost all of the spots we wanted to visit.  The service was friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again."}
{"text":"This hotel was fantastic!  The location is great, the staff is helpful, courteous and friendly. The rooms are amazing. Everything is white and bright and super clean. We stayed on the 3rd floor. There are no elevators, which was not a problem, at all, for us, but it could be for some people. There is a continental breakfast in the morning which had cereal, granola, toast, fruit, yogurt, coffee and tea. This hotel is kind of a cross between a bed and breakfast...homey, comfortable and warm and a hotel.  We loved this hotel and would definitely stay there again."}
{"text":"This hotel is full of charm and in a great area. Walkable to Mount Royal and Old Montreal. Good restaurants nearby too. Very cute building with lots of neat architectural details. Totally affordable and easy booking process. The continental breakfast is not very good and the stairs are awkward and strangely tiresome even just going up to the second floor. But definitely worth a stay here if you want to be in a good, safe location with unique accommodations. Also has parking in the back that you can reserve for an extra $15. Next time I'm in Montreal, this will be my home away from home."}
{"text":"Great location for a very good price. Nice room. Needed more towels. No desk after 11."}
{"text":"Stayed here on a recent trip to Montreal for four nights. We received really lovely service, in three languages, no less! The building is clean and quiet, the bed was comfortable and the included breakfasts were amply laid out. While the internet access is free, you must retrieve a new login & password each day from the front desk.

I wish I'd asked more about the building itself (my guess is mid-1800s). Our room had been reconfigured, like the rest of the hotel, remodeled so that new construction is mixed in with elements of the original architecture. Laying in bed, I tried to puzzle out the mix of molding on the ceiling to figure what the room had been like before. The same goes for trying to guess the meaning behind all of the different sets of stairs - they're everywhere! It's a neat old building.

Location is convenient to downtown and just a block from the McGill campus."}
{"text":"So much character, this old home converted into a hotel is adorable! Rooms are intimate and full of charm. Be prepared for stairs, since there is no elevator on site. Breakfast offerings included: Danishes, potatoes, sausages, eggs, fruit and much more. 

The hallways were very narrow and walls were rather thin, so keep that in mind when you do book your stay here.

Overall, I would stay here again."}

Re: Our 7/10/17 - 7/19/17 visit

Hello,
I would like to take a moment to tell you how wonderful your staff is.  Helena, Holly and Izzy were attentive, friendly, informative, patient and gracious.  Everyday for nine day's my friend and I peppered them with questions of How do...? What is ...? Why does it...? Where can we... ? How is the..? and on and on and on.  Always cheerful to answer and willing to find out an answer if they needed to. They, along with Clementine, Zachary and Zora gave us the best information about Montreal and some of the best, most personable service in our years of traveling. From filling ice bags to help a previous injury to my arm or faxing business documents that my friend needed to complete before we got stateside, your staff was professional, courteous and efficient AND all of it with an engaging smile and friendly banter. The classic room we stayed in was clean and lovely; the air-conditioning cool and the showers hot. Breakfast and coffee were an added delight.
We would happily stay with Hotel Ambrose again.

Sincerely,
Kate Fletcher and Dawn Snow Cinq-Mars

{"text":"This boutique hotel really reminded me of the place I stayed when I was last in Paris: narrow hallways, continental breakfast in the living room, and charming individuality in each room. The charm was the biggest draw to Hotel Ambrose--I was also pleased by the general cleanliness of the hotel and its proximity to the neighborhoods JJ and I wanted to visit. The staff were very helpful with everything we needed, provided we asked before 11PM (when the front desk closed for the night).

Major downsides: thin walls, for one. I could hear everything the other guests were doing. I also wouldn't book the economy room again--although the price couldn't be beat, the detached bathroom (around the hall and down the corner) was an interior space and the ventilation was terrible, so it was not the freshest for the entirety of our stay. 

A note about parking: if you bring your car here, I would recommend not booking parking with the hotel, as space is limited and must be booked ahead of time. The street parking around it is free, and not too crowded. There are also a few parking garages within a few blocks that are under $10 a day."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my 2 nights in this lovely hotel. The room is cute and clean, the bed is good, and the washroom is newly renovated."}
{"text":"For 3 nights and 4 days on the Victoria Day weekend, my boyfriend and I stayed here. We stayed in the Economy room, which was a small room and had a private bathroom across the hallway. This was NOT a problem at all; the bathroom itself was actually really nice and was just around the corner from our room. 

The hotel has such character; I would not change it a bit. It has charm and I loved it's quirk. The staff is very lovely and helpful. What I will say is that people that aren't into shape or have trouble with stairs may have an issue as there is no lift and quite a bit of stairs to climb if you are on the top floors. 

I would most definitely stay here again. Location is on a quiet street and not far from all the action. It's a short walk to the shopping, bars and food places that's open late or 24 hours. Would totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Wanted to make a nice quiet romantic night with my wife while we were visiting Montreal.  After a search, came across this hidden gem in downtown Montreal.  

On our arrival the staff were extremely friendly and very nice.  The hotel is in a building that's over 100 years old, but it was very clean and kept very well.  It had the old world charm, but the bathroom was updated with current fixtures which made our stay even more enjoyable.  The free continental breakfast was also very enjoyable and really good coffee


The only drawback as to why I didn't give a full 5 star is the TV channels.  Huge selection to choose from but only able to get about 20% of them

Definitely will be staying here next time we come back and will highly recommend this to friends and family"}
{"text":"My favorite meeting place in town. Excellent coffee and tea. The ambience is warm and welcoming. This is a place I am proud to bring friends/clients to have a long chat. Easily accessible by Metro(Peel), so leave the car at home.
Ambrose Hotel & Cafe"}
{"text":"I recently stayed at Hotel Ambrose for 3 nights. The location was ideal for shopping, restaurants and other downtown activities. I walked everywhere from this location, and knew I had a comfortable and clean room to return to.

The price was much better than other options in the area, and it included a free breakfast. The Wi-Fi was usually good, and the hotel was fairly quiet. 

Stairs would be difficult for anyone with mobility issues.

I will book here again when I return to the city."}
{"text":"The most kind and friendly staff. I enjoyed my stay here and the rooms are of very very good quality. The beds are sturdy and the walls are thick. The location is good although not central but not too far from all the action."}
{"text":"Really loved this hotel. The constant Groupon deals from the hotel makes it extremely affordable (around $50 a night), located right at the heart of Montreal. The staff is so friendly and vibrant. The breakfast is delicious with lots of options and a relatively big dining area for a B&B. The rooms can be small - one time the tub was located in the bedroom, we had a good laugh about it."}
{"text":"GREAT stay for your buck! We really loved the design of our room. The stuff was extremely helpful and friendly! A very convenient location!"}
{"text":"I stayed in a standard room which came with a private bathroom that included a large tub. Basic toiletries and a hair dryer are provided. No coffee maker in room but there is a cafe downstairs inside the hotel that opens at 7am. Very clean! Great price! Awesome location to walk to everything downtown. They even have parking if you try to reserve in advance. And if not, there is a parking garage a block away."}
{"text":"It is one of my fav cafes because it is such a urban oasis, it is close to McGill but not too many people know about the café because most people think that it is only serving the people who stay in the hotel, but NO! It is opened to the public and they offer several times free coffee on Friday, it is so amazing! They also did a brunch event with the Th3rd Wave and I happened to witness that event, their brunch options are really cool and I will get to try it soon! They offer a variety of breuvages, ranging from the everyday filter coffee to the funky pink latte (betterave juice gives the pink colour)! What I love the most is the vibes and the decor of the café, they play retro music and it is so lovely to just sit there and listen. Each corner of this chic and lovely cafe is instagrammable, like literally! It is so beautiful and so creative! Love it!"}
{"text":"Lovely, friendly service in a charming converted century home. If you're looking for a standard, nondescript hotel room, this is not your place. If you'd like a quiet place with character, give this place a call."}
