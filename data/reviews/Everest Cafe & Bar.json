{"text":"Wanting to try something new, and looking for a cool place to go for pre-Yuk-Yuks dinner and drinks, my friend and I decided to try out Everest Restaurant on Queen West.  What seemed to be a quiet Saturday evening when we first arrived at 7pm, quickly turned into a fairly busy \"club\" like dining experience. And Everest is certainly dressed to impress. The restaurant feels both sexy and modern, with dark mood lighting, clean lines, comfortable and cozy booth seating, and an eclectic playlist/DJ, depending on what night you are in. With a great view of Queen West for people watching, and MuchMusic across the street, the atmosphere, music and style of the restaurant blend in perfectly with the locals.  I was very excited to try a new place with an interesting food theme, something a little different from the usual weekend dinner and drinks, and hoping to find a new \"go-to\" place for a fun and creative meal. I secured reservations before our arrival, however, we were greeted with a bit of a frosty reception, waved to an area in the front of the room, and told I could sit wherever I wanted. Unorthodox, maybe, but sit we did! Putting the hostesses' indifference behind us, we decided to delve straight into the wine menu, and with a little help from our server, selected the Beringer Cabernet Sauvignon Knights Valley, a California vintage from 2009 for about $40. The wine was excellent, and I found the wine menu to be well priced for the quality of wines on the list.  The dinner menu ($15-$20) presents a somewhat more challenging predicament. Filled with Tibetan and Indian dishes, along side the same old North American stand-by of pasta and sandwiches, I found myself unsure if this was a Tibetan restaurant, or your average Italian eatery all dressed up. It's not that I mind an eclectic menu, in fact I appreciate one, however when venturing out to try a new type of cuisine (in this case, Tibetan), one wants to be sure that the restaurant is absolutely committed to their craft, and have their \"specialty cuisine\" down pat. Thus, I was unsure of whether venturing into the momas (Tibetan dumplings) and sha-momo (spinach and beef), or the fettuccine alfredo was the better option.  After some quality deliberation between the Tibet/North America paradox, I decided to try a platter, a mix of several different Tibetan style foods, to allow myself to experience as much of the cuisine as possible. The menu seemed heavy on potatoes, stewed meats and rice, so I decided to try almost all of the above. The stewed potatoes were good, cooked just right, but tasted much like something I could make at home, no real special spice or flavour that made me feel like I was trying something exotic. The rice was cooked with raisins, which just didn't do it for me, and was a little bland.  My meal was served with steamed Tibetan vegetables (broccoli and carrots), which aside from not seeming exceptionally Tibetan to me, were surprisingly good. An interesting side note, both of our meals were served with naan bread, which really was just pita bread from my estimation. Overall, I was fairly underwhelmed by my choice. My friend ordered the butter chicken on rice with naan bread (same problem), and said that she enjoyed her meal. The butter chicken looked and tasted pretty standard to me, so that must be a good thing, but neither of us could really wrap our heads around the lack on naan bread at restaurant serving Indian food.   While I thoroughly enjoyed Everest restaurant for its attention to the design décor and ambience, I was definitely a little disappointed with my first foray into Tibetan food. I think the next time we decide to go out for Tibetan style cuisine, we will try \"Little Tibet\" further down Queen Street."}
{"text":"I've always had a great experience at Everest. Every time I'm in the area, this is my go-to restaurant. The food is good and the atmosphere is relaxing. The location is spectacular and the view from the window as well as on the patio creates the perfect city dining experience. My favourite dish is the Tortellini a la Chef and the Creme Brûlée Cheesecake is Incredible! I mean it is mouth-watering delicious! I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a place with good food, a well-priced menu, and a great location."}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch today and can't say I was impressed.   Service was slow and uninformed. The menu was largely Indian and Tibetan food. I am well versed in Indian and tend to be quite critical when it's not done right so I thought I'd try something different off the Tibetan menu. We asked our server what was popular, he asked if I liked spicy food and proceeded to just point out spicy dishes. I just wanted to know what customers liked the most.   Went with one of his suggestions Phingsa (or something like that) which was chicken peas mushrooms noodles over rice. I don't know what the sauce was but it was ridden with corn starch slurry or something. A colleague described it as \"glunky\". Tasteless too. I ended up eating just the rice and some hot sauce from the table.   Did eat one momo dumpling and it was pretty decent.   Nice clean interior but I won't be back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really cool. The pricing is very reasonable.   I asked for chicken spring rolls and I'm sure I received veggie spring rolls. I asked my waiter if he is sure he got my order right. Without even checking my food he told me everything should be great..I'm positive I got veggie rolls instead of chicken spring rolls. Wasn't too happy about that.   I ordered some pasta. The taste was okay but I felt like my homemade pasta tastes better.   Would I go again? Maybe. Would I recommend it? Not really."}
{"text":"I've been here several times in the past few years, whenever we go to Toronto.  Has a fun hipster vibe, the food is decent and i've never had problems with the service.  Great patio, I have fond memories of sitting there on a hot day and having a couple of beer."}
{"text":"This is an awesome restaurant! It has something for everyone ... pizza, kalamari, Tibetan food, Indian food, even Thai. Usually when the menu is so diverse the quality of the food suffers, but everything we ordered was delicious, i.e. pizza, kalamari, chilli chicken, samosa. Service was good too, and the place is very clean!  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Everest. The patio is beautiful in the summer.  I have never had a bad experience here. I've always had great service and wonderful, fresh, delicious food. Typically, I get a pasta arribiata (not sure of the spelling) with grilled chicken, and bruschetta to share as an appitizer. The pasta is so fresh, with ther perfect amount of spices, and the chicken is so moist and tender.   I've never found the service to be bad, except on occasion with the bill. Otherwise, I find that the waiters are always coming by to check on the meal and offer fresh ground pepper and cheese."}
{"text":"Decided to try this before going to the theater since it was very reasonably priced.  We asked the server for a recommendation on Tibetan food and my husband got the Momo dumplings.  They were super bland.  No flavour or spicing whatsoever- BIG disappointment.  I got the Saag Paneer.  All the Indian dishes came with no 'spiciness' with a side of hot sauce.  I was OK with this since that day I wanted super mild.  The flavouring of the food was excellent but I'm not sure just adding hot sauce would give the proper spiciness to the food.  The paneer was also very firm.  Tasted fine, but not the texture I'm used to.  Overall, I don't think we'd go here again, but will give Tibetan/ Nepalese food another try elsewhere."}
{"text":"I think I like this place... I mean I go there for lunch on occasion so that means I don't hate it, right?  But there is something about it that would make this my evening's 20th choice at best. At lunch, the staff seems friendly enough albeit a tad slow considering you're likely limited to how long you have for lunch if you work in the area. And I wouldn't kick some of their food out of bed (I do enjoy their crispy calamari and a few of their pasta) so what is it?  Well, should you go for post-work drinks with co-workers, the staff goes from friendly to irritable in a matter of seconds - like they're already anticipating a busful of teenagers on Spring Break who are there to cause a ruckus (the fact that I just used the word 'ruckus' proves I'm much older than your average teen... and lame to boot).  So, what did we all learn? Looks like 2 1/2 stars is more accurate but I'll round the rating up to 3 stars if only for their mushroom fettucini. You can enjoy a quiet lunch there but avoid going in a larger group in the evening -- looks like they don't care of that kind of patronage there."}
{"text":"I only ever have their burger and fries and I oddly really like them. Like, a lot. There's nothing special about the dish - just a straight up burger and straight up fries (which I douse in mayo and salt).   And that's all I really have to say about this place.  So there."}
{"text":"Went here for a bachelorette party and we were the only ones there after midnight. The guys who worked there hooked their ipods up to the speakers and took request they also gave us a round.of free shots. What more could you ask for?! Overall the food isn't that expensive and it's really cute on the inside."}
{"text":"Foods are hit or miss as sometimes they are oversalted and greasy. But Himalayan dumplings are must try. They are yummy. Most of the foods on menu are Indian dishes from which I tried chicken tandoori. It was fairly decent but pricing is competitive. I always felt this restaurant is too loud but which isn't in this neighbourhood?"}
{"text":"Fantastic martinis (special on Thursdays) and friendly staff.  Nice outdoor seating too."}
{"text":"I went here for a bachelorette party, and we had a great time. The food was great and affordable, and the staff was very personable. I've been here a few times since, and have yet to be disappointed.  The decor is also really nice, and the location is great  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in there yesterday for a few drinks. The servers were very good. Much better than the usual Toronto service: surly, with a hand outstretched for a tip!"}
{"text":"I just watched the owner  push and elderly woman who collects bottles in the neighborhood and take her cart. Then he was rude when confronted. Frankly the whole thing disgusted me.  Don't go to this place."}
{"text":"I went to lunch here and they advertised outside they are showing the world cup game , but they only had one screen, and didnt even play the sound. There were two games going on at the same time and when i asked the waiter to change to the other game he gave me attitude and tried to be cocky . Bringing food took half an hour and it was almost time for me to head back to work. POOR SERVICE ! never going back !"}
{"text":"This place was one of my favourite restaurants to eat at when I worked across the street.  Not only do they have a fabulous patio, but the ambiance of the restaurant itself is extremely warm and welcoming.  The staff is superb, as is the food. Speaking of food - whether you like Indian, Tibetan, Asian, Italian or American, Everest has got it all.  I especially love their Sabji Rassa and their Chana Masala. I've also been told from my meat-eating dates that their butter chicken is to die for.  Just a word of caution for my fellow diners - if you're planning on ordering a pizza, expect it to take over an hour. They make the crust from scratch and while it does take forever, it is delicious. I ordered it once and wouldn't order it again based on how long it takes. Their other food is equally delicious, so order something you don't have to wait as long for!  Everest has great ambiance, excellent service and mouth-watering food. How could I *not* give them 5 stars?!?!?"}
{"text":"This was my first and last visit to the restaurant.  Walk on by and find another place on Queen st. My friend and I destined for a movie a 7:00 pm arrived at the restaurant at 5:20 pm and are seated promptly in the dining room. The place is almost empty with maybe another 6 tables of patrons seated. The wait begins, 10 minutes for a waiter to come by and take a drink order from us, another 10 minutes for a food order to be taken.  We order some veggie spring rolls to share as an appetizer on the recommendation from our serve staff and they are rated as excellent.  We also order 2 main courses, the Beef biryani and the Free Tibet.  The appetizers arrive in about 10 minutes and are 2 standard deep fried spring roles that are plated with some green and under whelming sauce.  They  are over cooked. This does not set the standard.   The main courses arrive to the table after another 15 minute wait. The Beef is over cooked, under spiced and the rice is not flavored, it look like I just over paid for a microwave meal that was  fried.  My friends Free Tibet meal consist of noodles that seem days old, tough to chew and devoid of flavor.  We leave in silence after paying a 50$ bill for the both of us, I feel ill for the rest of the night  We spent over an hour  wait for some mediocre food and experienced very poor service"}
{"text":"I've been dropping into Everest semi-regularly for about a year now. When I'm downtown, it's my \"go-to\" spot when I'm not sure what I want.   It's mix of Tibetan and Indian food provides plenty of vegetarian options. My first few visits were focused on the Platter, which provides a great sampling of their curried vegetables (excellent on its own), momoas, and noodles.  I've brought a few friends here, who have invariably picked the platter, and have always been pleased with it.   I love the modern, chill vibe. The seats are comfortable, and lighting is just right for a chilled out conversation. Other reviewers complain about the service, but I've always had a great experience.   Lastly, the location has served me well. I'm often wanting to head down Queen St. or thereabouts, and need some dinner with friends before heading to a show, or the (very nearby) movie theatre. Heading to Everest is a great way to launch my weekend outings downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"We celebrated a friend's Birthday at Everest during Happy Hour.  The menu offers a variety of Himalayan dumplings and delicious curries. We shared the Everest Platter ($14.95) which comes with dumplings, noodles, curry and naan bread. Drink prices are pretty standard ($6 for a glass of wine).  We sat outside on the patio and received standard service, as we had not encountered the busy dinner time yet.  Everest is a great place to sample and share the variety of foods.  If you're looking for a relaxed environment to have a drink and nibble, you'll enjoy the pleasant ambiance."}
{"text":"Mon adresse préférée lorsque j'habitais à Toronto. La bouffe était géniale, le service impeccable. La décoration, l'aménagement étaient de toute beauté. Vraiment agréable comme endroit."}
{"text":"Really....\"meh\" best describes it.  The food is okay, edible, but not great.  I have had MUCH better.  The atmosphere is fairly pretty (which bodes well for me).  Has the patio and all.  The automatic doors I think are a little odd in a restaurant...am I at a restaurant or Loblaws?!"}
{"text":"Worst restaruant ever. ok, not worst, but so below average and on top of that ridiculously bad pretentious service that you don't want to ever step foot in that resturant and you will even go OUT of your way to write a horribly bad review on yelp just to let anyone and everyone else know it sucks.  below-average asian fusion food.  tries to be trendy. it has nice decor, i'll give it taht.  but the service staff is just so pretentious and rude and it also has a history of being haters to people in wheelchairs that I would avoid this place at all costs and spread the word that they are a horrible establishment."}
{"text":"Been here around 3-4 times, and each time it was not my suggestion and was for a friend's celebration. It's good for groups as the menu is very diverse, but it's not a place I would suggest for any function I would put on. I enjoy trying out new things items, so the menu is fun to choose from, but I'm always wary when I see something like \"pizza\" at places like this, although I have heard good things about it from some people. Portions are generally large too so that's a plus if you're really hungry.   I'm not a great fan of all the dishes they have, you can get better food of similar type at better prices at other locations around the city. I got the \"Phingsha\" which was a beef/chicken dish in a glass noodle with dried mushrooms (which I love), and when it came, the plate had only half Phingsha and half filled with a  mound of white rice which no amount of hot sauce and mixing helped with the taste.   The location is great especially before a movie or something, but I'm still not sold on the general feel of the restaurant. The staff have been pretty good each time, the food does tend to take its own sweet time getting to us, but it's not the worst I've experienced.   I think if this was a place that was smaller and had a simple atmosphere without trying so hard to fit in, and instead found around Chinatown I would find it more to my liking. So, it comes close to a 4 star review on my end, but there's something it lacks, or it just tries to be too many things that don't quite mesh together that keeps it at 3 star level for me."}
{"text":"After running a little late, and leaving a friend and I with only an hour for dinner before our movie, we opted to venture into one of the restaurants along Queen Street near the Scotiabank Theatre (instead of our original plan on King Street).   The automatic doors was a bit strange, and the inside is not as dark as it looks from the outside. We had an excellent server, who was prompt with taking our orders and bringing it us in a timely manner, and was quite friendly.  We both got dishes from the Indian menu (Butter Chicken, and Sizzling Tandoori Chicken), and I must say, we were surprised by the portion size (larger than we thought) and satisfied with our dishes.  With the movie about the start, we ended dinner early, but told ourselves we would definitely return. It's been a restaurant we've bypassed many times while walking along Queen Street, but was overall satisfied with our decision to check it out."}
{"text":"i live for their butterchicken! It's simply amazing and so is their naan bread. They also serve amazing drinks. I've been here numerous times and service is a bit of a hit or miss but the food has always been delicio"}
{"text":"I've been here two times, once was for drinks/munchies and another was just for a birthday dinner.  The most memorable for me within the limited foods I've tried from here were the butter chicken, their bruschetta, and sangria. The other foods such as their stir fried noodles were not. Their food wouldn't be classified as amazing but more as safe. If you want to not get disappointed then this is a safe restaurant to go to.  Their service is good but don't expect anything too out of ordinary. We wanted to sit in the booths but were told they were reserved...wth. Two people were sitting there chatting away & the restaurant was empty. I don't understand how hard it was to just let us sit there.  In the end, not my first choice in restaurants but good enough to come again."}
{"text":"Dined here last night with a couple of friends. I liked the nifty slidey doors and the cool, modern decor aaaaaaand that's about it. Service was extremely slow albeit the lack of business. Just getting water... seemed to be a chore for our server, :/.   I ordered the Chili Chicken for $13.51 and yeah, I've had better. It was rather salty and... clumpy/gooey? Weird. The rice was, at least, okay. Oh, and I've discovered sour carrots aren't really my thing. Though, the sizzling Tandoori chicken looked/sounded appetizing.   As mentioned before by other reviewers, there is a lot of variety so this may be the restaurant to go to if you've got a diverse group. Prolly won't be coming back here unless circumstances dictate otherwise."}
{"text":"Had nachos which were surprisingly meh. Bar tap choice was kind of limited, and they didn't have all on tap.  The ambiance was nice, but the nachos remain in my mind."}
{"text":"** 3.5 Stars **  I'll say it right off the bat, you're paying for the atmosphere when you come here. Everest provides a lounge atmosphere with a nice patio in the summer. They serve Tibetan / Indian food with some sandwiches and pizza's in between. Their food is definitely not bad, but it's nothing special and even though the mains are all between $9-11 which is pretty good, the portion size is really small (as they try to maintain their fanciness).  I've come here twice and I've never had any problems with their staff or service other than it being a little slow. But if you're actually craving Indian/Tibetan food, I'd rather go to some other mom n pop Indian shop, get HUGE portions for the same if not lower price and have it taste even better :) I usually come here if I'm tired from walking on Queen and want a nice place to just chill and relax before heading out again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant!!!  My friend and I recently dropped by after a couple years of not going (distance wise).. The food was spectacular. We're absolute suckers for the Butter Chicken; melt in your mouth deliciousness. Prices are actually quite reasonable!"}
{"text":"Momos and beer on a warm Toronto patio for lunch - awesome! Tried the mixed momo's...  and would do them again!"}
{"text":"Had a great Tibetan meal here. Fresh ingredients, very spicy seasoning, and perfect portion made the meal. Tried the steamed bread and it was excellent. We also had a very good Hawaiian pizza too. Great mix of food types. Only thing I didn't like was the background music."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed about this restaurant was the sliding doors to get in. Once in we chose to sit at the patio since it was nice and warm outside.  The service was OK. Although the waiter got one of the 4 orders incorrect, they did fix it immediately. I had the momos. The momos were quite good, but didn't seem like a dinner size dish. Another person in our group ordered a chili beef dish off the Tibetan menu. It was really good and the right size for dinner.  I would suggest not ordering from the Indian menu, the naans just seemed like they were out of a grocery store pack.  Overall a good change of pace and one of the few places to find Tibetan food in Toronto."}
{"text":"Okay restaurant that probably only survives because of its location on the busy Queen West strip. I have eaten her numerous times due to the proximity to the Four Seasons Centre (there aren't a lot of good restaurant in the area that aren't expensive... if I feel like splurging, Nota Bene is fantastic).  The decor is clean and modern (like most places, in an attempt to look cool, it is really DARK!) with a lovely patio. Service is average.  The menu is pretty hit and miss. They include everything from butter chicken to chow mein to pizza, so this is one of those cases of a menu being too ambitious instead of focusing on their strengths. I guess it's good if you are with a large group of diners with different preferences.  The Tibetan momos come in a beef or vegetarian variety, and both are quite good. I had the tofu/veggie stir-fry another time and it was a huge let-down. Soggy, frozen vegetables over minute rice in a gelatinous, flavourless sauce. Ew.  So, 2 stars in you order the wrong thing and 4 stars if you get one of their better dishes. It really depends..."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday (her suggestion btw), and I thought the place was great.  We went for drinks, but ended up ordering the food too.  I had the samosas and spicy shrimp pizza - it was really good.  The sizzling tandoori chicken looked good too (a friend got it), the serving was really big.  The mango smoothie was the smoothest I've ever had!  The reason for 5 stars was mainly for the service, the server was very attentive and checked up on us frequently.  He got the drinks right and catered to us and even told us a joke at the end of the night, which was funny.  He went out of his way to print us separate bills and although we had a large group of 10, he didn't add the gratuity and allowed us to tip him as we wished.  This place was perfect for the little birthday party that we had, much better than if we had gone to a pub.  The food was good, the service was great and we had a little secluded area so it was more private and comfortable.  It was also very clean and classy looking."}
{"text":"Interesting fact: the servers here can't smile because it goes against their programming. About a year ago, a lone server smiled on a Saturday night and it caused the automatic glass sliding doors to the patio/entrance to short-circuit. Since that fateful day, smiles are forbidden.  Seriously, the pretension here makes me laugh :-)  Get over yourselves people: this part of Queen West hasn't been \"cool\" since it turned into a chain-store strip mall! Drop the attitude.  I visit Everest at least once a year, but I'm not sure why I keep coming back because there are so many other places that look better.  Usually it's a last resort when I'm with vegetarians and it's late, but I'd rather opt for Spring Rolls and save $$$ next time.    Without exception, everything on the menu is either over-salted or greasy. I always try something different but nothing I've had here is really passable or worth repeating.  But like a dog running into an electric fence I keep trying new menu options and hoping that this time will be different; this time will be better. The butter chicken I had here last weekend was so salty that the next morning I woke up with cracked, chapped lips. The naan bread tastes dried out and almost crispy- more like pita bread actually.  I'm giving 2 (not 1) stars to Everest for the drink menu, which has some tasty (albeit spendy) options and thankfully omits the vile \"gourmet\" tequila and gruesomely overpriced vodka that seems to be infecting the other downtown establishments. The irony here is that this pretentious place is lagging behind the drink trends (in favor of my uncool tastes). Give it time and I'm sure we'll see some ridiculous attempt at tequila-based sludge."}
{"text":"Food tastes alright but isn't really \"authentic\" Indian food if that's what you're looking for, and the portions are pretty small. Personally I won't come here again though I can see how others would like it.  Service is good and the place is clean. Decent beer collection."}
{"text":"A rather typical establishment for this part of Toronto: fancyish decor, subpar food, and crappy service.  I came here on a date and ordered food and beverage and everything was bleh.  Not bad, but not good.  Below average I'd say.  The prices were certainly high for what you get in terms of quality of food, but you're paying for the location and pretension.  Not my thing.    The service is not just slow, but inattentive.  We finished our food and drinks and never once did the waiter come back to ask us if we wanted anything else or offer us some water.  Nothing.  We paid but stuck around for a while talking and I was considering ordering another drink and some desert, but he never came around.  Just nothing.  I think it's pretty average or slightly above for places in this part of town, so if you're from around Toronto then you'll probably think this place is pretty good.  But it is quite below average in the grand scheme of things.    With all the other average and below places around here, I certainly won't be going back to this one."}
{"text":"From the Tibetan portion of the menu, my friend and I ordered two dishes to share. The tsel tofu ($8.95) was essentially long, thin strips of beancurd and veggies stirfried in unexciting brown sauce and served with lukewarm steamed Chinese buns which should normally be bursting with steam when ripped apart for dipping. The tsel momo ($9.95) was a better example of the steamed dumpling skins stuffed with Indian-influenced curried potato and pea fillings.  It was a brilliant day on the patio with the perfect amount of shade coming from the trees above. However, beware of the table to the right immediately outside of the fancy automatic sliding door. I might have enjoyed my meal a lot more without the sprinklings from the a/c above.   Despite the nice weather and time of day and hence the swarms of tourists and lunch-doers, there was no real excuse for the forgetful and over all slow service. While we tried to shrug off the shrug off that we received when we alerted our server of the a/c drippings, the table beside us got a half joking \"Well, I can't bring the airport to you\" when they politely mentioned that they were in a hurry to catch their flight and had already been waiting patiently for a while.  It would take a lot for me to come back here, but I can see how the varied menu and location would make it a safe choice for out-of-towners to try something new and exotic while waiting for a Much Music personality sighting."}
{"text":"The decor was nice but the food wasnt thaaaat great. It was OK. It was also pretty empty when i went mid day. Ive never had tibetan food so it was a nice new experience."}
{"text":"I give this one a \"Yay! I'm a fan.\" rating with a grain of salt ... just remember that when you go out, it is a package deal.  You get the neighbourhood, the vibe of the staff, your group and or individual mood/tastes/expectations and of course - the food. I've been here about 5 times over the past 10 years (3 of which I lived within 200 meters), and so long as the expectations were reasonable - it meets them :).   The Tibetan portion of the menu is very reasonable, and has some spicey kick.  I've had the Indian vindaloo which is pretty good too.  I've read through some of the below reviews, and all make valid points, but hey - you're in the middle of Queen west  remember.  What I've determined is ideal is to go to Everest and enjoy the patio ... the tables right up closest to Queen (where you will be asked for change, but hey - they ask when you're walking around too ... so get over it).  The key here is to ENJOY the drinks, and nibble and sample/share some food as a bonus.  When you look at very close by patio options, there's Black Bull or Rivoli which are both dramatically different vibes.  I like this one for ppl watching and enjoying a couple drinks.  Cheers."}
{"text":"For a Himalayan/Indian/Nepalese restaurant, this place has the best Mushroom Fettucine in Toronto! That's probably the one dish I'd keep coming back for. The establishment is classy and would be a great place to celebrate a birthday. The reason I didn't give them 5-stars is because the waiter that night came off snobby and rude.  I asked if the Mushroom Fettucine was the only type of Alfredo pasta they had and he said to check the menu."}
{"text":"So spicy I almost peed myself.   No really, I was tearing up as I ate my chicken madras and I had to take several breaks to gather myself enough to continue. I'm not a hot sauce drinker or anything, but I'm not a spicy food lightweight, either.   It was 3pm on a Saturday and I wanted to try the butter chicken roti at Gandhi. Sadly, they wete closed. So I headed over to India Palace to try out their special ($15 for a samosa, main dish, side, and dessert!) but apparently it wasn't available until 5pm. Feeling desperate and very sad at this point, I ended up going to Everest because I saw a sign outside advertising a special - chicken madras and rice and naan for $8.95 (great deal!) - so I went in, because I wanted any Indian food I could get.  Turned out it was rice OR naan.  Oh well.  The interior was trendy and cool, and the service was friendly enough. But it took a LONG time to get my food, especially since the place was pretty empty and the meat tasted like leftovers!  The food quality was poor. The chicken had that refrigerated taste that's not very nice - luckily, it was partly masked by the curry and its overwhelming heat. The rice was poor quality but well cooked. The sauce was actually quite good when I was able to taste it.   I feel like the chef probably knew what (s)he was doing but the raw materials were low quality and serving refrigerated chicken is just unacceptable. Combined with the suuuper slooow service - nope, nope, nope!"}
