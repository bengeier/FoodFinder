{"text":"I actually only ate here cause I walked in here expecting it to be the restaurant next door. However the dishes that greeted me at the table suited my tastes, as I was born in Shan Dong province too.   I got the double cooked meet along with two skewer orders. The sausage and the chicken soft bone. The skewers were ok, a bit on the light side. The double cooked meal tasted like a home cooked meal, only a bit more greasy. There's nothing too special and nothing too bad to really report here on yelp. I guess the price is ok for the taste and portion you receive.  This place is good for a quick midnight snack as it's open late and features different skewers that satisfies late night cravings."}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant is pretty good, decent price and nice staff. I ordered ??? and ???, both are fine as per quality. I hope they will have more varieties."}
