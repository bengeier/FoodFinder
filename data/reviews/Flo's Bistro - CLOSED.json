{"text":"I went to this restaurant before a craft show and was very impressed by the server and the food. The server was more than friendly and prompt in serving us, and the food was prepared hot and fresh. I would definitely recommend this place for a quick breakfast...nothing fancy but tastes delicious!"}
{"text":"home cooking at its best. Very friendly staff, and very cozy atmosphere.  The prices are very reasonable. A must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! Most places around Royalton serve frozen reheated breakfast but I loved how fresh everything was. It was delicious and very affordable. I've been here multiples time and will definitely come back again. I've recommended it to several people and encourage you to try it! Location is great and it a nice and cozy cafe."}
{"text":"The closest you can get to good home cooking without wearing pajamas to the table. Simple menu, super ingredients, friendly service.   Home made corned beef hash with freshly shaved corned beef is the ONLY thing I have ordered because I love it so much. Perfectly seasoned with *gooshy* poached eggs just the way I like 'em.   I bring fellow diners in order to try their plates. Every one a home run: corned beef & swiss omelette (see the corned beef theme?), pancakes, potatoes, waffles.   Full disclosure: This is not a fast food restaurant. And I've never tried the coffee."}
{"text":"I have no idea what their food was like, but the service was terrible.  I walked in, the waitress said to sit anywhere. I sat next to a table where she was taking the order of two customers. They were chatting about all the restaurants, who owned what, etc. while ignoring me sitting 3 feet away. After five minutes I gave up and walked out."}
{"text":"Delicious. Very happy with my breakfast and so were my coworkers. We will be back soon enough! 4 people 4 different meals and all were perfect!"}
{"text":"If you like small mom-and-pop restaurants you must try this place. It is small, quaint and down to earth. The food is moderately price. I rather come here and experience home cooked meals rather than going to a box store. If you are in the mood for a good down-to-earth breakfast from a mom-and-pop diner you must try this place"}
{"text":"I was really surprised at our experience because the reviews were so good for this place. We love smaller places (and breakfast) so we thought this would be perfect.   When we walked in the server gave us a curt \"sit wherever\" and continued to talk to the table she was at. No big deal. But she didn't wander over to our table (which was dirty.. all of the open ones were) for about 10 minutes. She didn't waste any time making small talk, not even a good morning. Just took our order and didn't come back again at all until she brought out the food. My husband really has excellent restaurant patience, way more than the average person. Shortly into the experience he wanted to put some money on the table and just go somewhere else. I felt bad and thought we ought to give the food a chance anyway because of the reviews so we stayed.   My chocolate chip pancakes were good, pretty close to the way we make them at home. My husbands food was okay except for the bacon which came out looking and tasting very strange. The atmosphere and service definitely will keep us from returning."}
{"text":"Food is good, as long as you have time to wait for it. Very small place, and if it's full, you could be waiting over an hour for breakfast. Also, they've tried to over charge me twice on my bill, so you might want to pay attention to that."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I just had to post. We were greeted nicely by the one employee working there for breakfast. Food was served with a smile 25 minutes after we sat down. Food was very tasty. Coffee was refilled several times without delay.  Other employee finally showed up as we were finishing breakfast. The guy we had did a great job managing everything.  Room for improvement: the table next to us was dirty when we arrived and even after the female employee showed up, it was never bussed. Front walkway was full of snow and should have been shoveled or had salt put down.  Workers there could have nicer outfits like an apron. Hers looked like she slept in her outfit.  Floors were very dirty. She spilled coffee on floor and didn't clean it up.  Both were quite friendly though and food was very nice."}
{"text":"Where so I start... It took almost a hour to get our food when the diner was almost empty, the kitchen was a mess and was VERY dirt, the waitress was terrible and all the tables were dirty. Do your self a favor and go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"My toast was black and so was the pancake. Service was super slow, and there were only 4 other tables occupied. A table sat next to me with dirty dishes piled up until I left. I killed a fly on the table and more attended the funeral, there was gross newspaper wedged under the table to shim it. This could be SO much better but I left unsatisfied. A McDonald's McMuffin would have hit the spot better. I didn't want to write this, bc I truly want to support local business, but maybe this could be a tool to improve."}
{"text":"My daughter and I love trying a new breakfast place almost every weekend. This place gets two stars because the food was good. LITERALLY over an hour for some eggs and pancakes. Ridiculous. We were in a hurry and didn't check my bill. Got in the car and realized I was charged $32 for breakfast for two people. Noticed in another review they were overcharged. If you have nothing better to do than wait and over pay for your breakfast knock yourself out"}
{"text":"Small family style diner. Great atmosphere and staff. Food was tasty and inexpensive. Due to the small size the restaurant filled up quickly. 2 thumbs up. I will visit again."}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland this past weekend and went to Flo's twice for breakfast. I usually like to try something different day to day when I am somewhere new, but I liked it so much the first time I had to go back for seconds.  This is a small place but it is packed full of love and good food. They have booths, tables, and a small bar. The dining room is clean, the servers are friendly, and the prices are great.  I met a friend who lives in the area and we were greeted both days walking in the door. We got our drinks and were able to place our order fast. Our coffees were topped off multiple times, we were checked up on after our food was brought out, and check out was a breeze from the table.  As far as the food I got a couple of eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast. The eggs were good. The hash browns were outstanding, freshly sliced and tomatoes, onions, and peppers were added at no additional charge. The bacon was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of crisp and chew. Toast was right on but this might be the only time I have gotten one piece for breakfast, not a complaint just an observation.  I have no problem recommending this place to anyone that lives in the area or are looking for a new breakfast spot. It may not be great for large groups because of the size but it is awesome for families and couples. Their prices are outstanding and a great value."}
{"text":"Flo's is an adorable hidden gem!!! The atmosphere is fun and laidback, the owner is so accommodating AND THE FOOD IS DELISH!!! I got the Reuben, it was fantastic!!! Definitely adding this place to our Sunday brunch places:)"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with my wife. This is a nice neighborhood diner with friendly workers. You get good home style food prepared well at a very reasonable price. Frankly I felt a little guilty walking out with only a $10 check for two people.   The specials are cheap and plentiful.  I ordered Flo's Bagel... with two eggs, cheese, and a huge pile of ham, it was way more than a sandwich. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a great little spot in North royalton.  Very homey and there owner is so accommodating.  I had the omlette and it was amazing.  Def adding this place to our Sunday brunch list."}
