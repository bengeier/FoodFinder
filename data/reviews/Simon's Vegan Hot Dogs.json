{"text":"Amazing, delicious vegan hotdogs. We ordered the Colombian, German and Sonoran dogs \"California\" style. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"}
{"text":"Super excited that I can get my Simon's fix without going to scottsdale! Hands down my favorite vegan hot dogs ever and surprisingly their vegan mac and cheese is also the best I ever had!! Everyone is always so friendly and I hope they continue to do the pop up stand."}
{"text":"I went to their pop up shop on a Saturday. I had The Colombian Hot Dog, and I cannot remember the name of the other hot dog.The hotdogs at this stand are very filling, and it was hard for me to finish them both. The macaroni and cheese was delicious so good that I ordered more to take home. The employees were very nice, and accommodating. The food was hot, and the service was great. I will definitively come back to try again"}
{"text":"Amazing vegan dogs! They have standard types like the German (sauerkraut) and the Colombian (pineapple) as well as rotating specials. They also have a selection of 'meats'. The cold bean salid is fresh, refreshing, and very tasty, but a small portion. Great service, too!"}
