{"text":"Quite good.  We ordered take out once before from here,  and weren't impressed. Came in for a sit down meal and it was the complete opposite.  Well done!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!!!!! Went on Christmas Eve and tried lots of dim sum and appetizers. Everything was great...both me and my gf loved. Owners and servers were really great as well."}
{"text":"Love Duckee! They are very family friendly and no issue taking the kids there. They beg to go all the time. The wonton soup is full of fresh vegetables.  Love love love the green curry--excellent spice and again lots of nice fresh veggies that are cooked perfectly.  Sesame balls are made to order--be careful they can burn your tongue but oh so yummy.  The owner is really nice and comes over and chats.  Delivery is ok but I really like eating in the restaurant. 
Relaxed atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"Flavorful dishes. Mix of Chinese and South East Asian food. Indeed unique in this neighborhood. Owners Johnny and Magie were there everytime we went, very attentive service. Prices were good considering their location, definitely cheaper than 7 Numbers across the road and much better quality food than Sweet Home. Tastefully decorated and clean. What they called tapas were actually dim sum, and to my delight they were actually fairly good. 
Love their curry dishes, I am guessing one of their chiefs is from Thailand. 
Will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!,

Went here for linner (lunch dinner) and it was just great!.
The staff was super friendly and helpful and accommodating.  The food was so good that we have had take out from here twice.  The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food.

The dumplings and smaller items were very filling but not too filling.  You feel very satisfied after eating here.

My only negative comment was the dragon whiskers were a little to salty for my taste.  

I look forward to coming here for another great meal."}
{"text":"I went with my fam for all you can eat Dim Sum. It was delicious! My favourites were the steamed Sui Mai, Phoenix Pearl and Malaysian satay. The owner was serving us at the end. He was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Love this place, very  friendly staff, amazing sups, best dumplings ever. And they deliver!!!
Try them."}
{"text":"We ordered from Duckee on Christmas day and we were very happy with our order! We ordered about 5-6 dishes and they were all pretty great. Very flavorful. We decided to go out there for dinner this past Friday and I was surprised how dead it was there. We ordered one of the dishes we had on Christmas day--green thai curry with beef, and it was wonderful, as it was on Christmas day. We also had a basil chicken dish that was very good. 
The disappointing part was seeing how much communication issues there was between the waitresses and another two diners that were there before us. There was so much confusion regarding their order, things kept coming late, etc. 
We will definitely return for more meals and order from the JustEat app,but have a few pointers for the restaurant:
They really need to work on their communication skills with their diners.
They need to make sure the restaurant is clean. We sat in a booth part and there were crumbs and food particles all over the seats."}
{"text":"We tried the hot and sour soup, and the 2 course duck both of which were very good. 

The hot and sour soup was a perfect blend of hot and sour. I have had some pretty bad hot and sour soups before where it was sooooooo sour that when you would drink it, it would choke you, but the soup here is a perfect balance. The first course for the duck is crispy duck with pancakes, spring onions and cucumber. You wrap the duck, spring onions and cucumbers with some peking duck sauce and you wrap it up with a pancake. It is delicious but the only problem is they don't put enough spring onions on the platter, but you can always ask for some more and they always bring it out. The second course is minced duck and you wrap it with lettuce. It is very filling and ordering the hot and sour soup and 2 course duck would be good for 2 people. The restaurant is called \"Duckee\" so you guys should probably try the duck first. I went here twice and ordered the same thing and have not been disappointed. The only criticism I can make is that the mince duck is a little flavourless and they could do something about it.

Service wise, the waiters are very nice and never pester you or annoy you. When we went the second time there was a family and I felt really bad when their 2 kids were being very rude. Obviously their parents haven't taught their kids any manners because they were barging into the kitchen and pestering the waiters saying they are tired waiting for the food and stuff. I might have thought it was funny if it looked like the kids didn't know any better but the fact they said it in huge demanding angry voices and treated the waiters like they were garbage showed that the kids were very badly raised and are acting like spoiled brats. The waiters were very nice however and even though these little kids were treating the waiters like their slaves they still acted very nicely towards them. Also the service was not slow at all and they brought it all our food very quickly so there was no reason to be angry or impatient at them either. I noticed the family already had like 5 main dishes on their table already and they still had lots to eat at the table so they actually had no reason to treat those waiters like trash. Then these kids started jumping around on all the seats like it was their house and the parents did nothing to stop them. I think the service should be given 5 stars for being very patient with such a rude family.

Overall
5 stars for Service

4 Stars for food"}
{"text":"I've had food from here twice, both times as delivery. I feel like this place has mastered teleportation, because I swear to god, both times I ordered from here it was at my door in under 20 minutes, super hot and fresh... like it had just been cooked and instantly arrived at my house. \"Order up.... energize!\" haha. 

Ok food: 
I ordered the chicken friend rice, lemon chicken and a beef dish that I forget the name of. My boyfriend and I agreed it was THE BEST EVER. Specifically the rice... I don't know what it is, but it's just spectacular. 

That's all you need to know. TRY IT. YOU'RE WELCOME."}
{"text":"It was a very pleasant experience and the service was great so was the food. I am looking forward for my next visit."}
{"text":"I ordered the honey garlic spare rib, sweet sour pork and steamed shrimp dim sum. 

The spare ribs were basically pieces of deep fried batter with a bit of a honey glaze. I had to throw out the dish after only a few bites. I don't anticipate eating healthy when I order in Chinese food (especially given the items i ordered) but this was utterly ridiculous. It seemed like I was eating the left over deep fried bits from the fryer covered with a bit of honey. 

The sweet and sour pork on the other hand was soggy and bland. At least there were pieces of meat that could be distinguished from the sauce and breading but definitely a sub par dish. 

Finally the dim sum. I ordered it steamed and they were obviously deep fried. This meal was an utter disappointment. The food came in a rapid time.. approximately 20 mins after placing my order. I was impressed but skeptical and I was right to be skeptical as they apparently didn't read the order and just dropped everything into the deep fryer, covered it in sauce and plated it. I would not go back and cannot fathom how this restaurant has such a high rating on yelp. I think I took a grand total of two bites from each dish and then threw the rest out. Such a waste."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. Ordered take-out this weekend...Shanghai noodles, veg fried rice, pad thai, beef with vegetables. All delicious. Only complaint was the teriyaki beef. The sauce came in a separate container and the beef was just a thin slab or two with a bunch of vegetables. Wasn't great to look at."}
{"text":"AWESOME. Delivery was fast (and free), prices and portions were great. The deep fried honey garlic pork was actually CRUNCHY and fresh. Also got the BBQ Pork steamed buns, mango salad, Udon with beef, and Cantonese chow mein and all were great. Everything tasted fresh and was nicely prepared. We ordered at 7:00 on Sat night and delivery was even earlier than expected. So nice to finally find a place like this after always being disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a Chinese food snob so you might want to take this with a grain of salt. 

I'm used to downtown Chinese food so lots of flavour. This was fairly bland food that looked outstanding. Really got my hopes up. 

I see the appeal for some people but I'm going to stick to Hong shing and new ho King"}
{"text":"Love this spot. Great service, welcoming staff. Food is excellent with superb ingredients. High end Asian Fusion. Have the duck! Also, the barbecue their own pork and it is fabulous. Johnny runs a fine establishment, I am a huge fan.

They also do a very good dim sum with a nice array of dumplings and small dishes to share. Nice way to take a bigger group out."}
{"text":"Me and my wife were just walking along Eglinton Street prior to our appointment,  and because we were quite early and still got a lot of time to stroll, we saw Duckee and agreed to try it. Once the food were served we were just like a happy duo tasting our delicious order. I will recommend this to my friends. I am happy with the service and the place is so pretty. We will come back here again."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for date night. Very classy decor with attentive service. The bf and I went for dinner at 5pm on a saturday night. There was literally NO ONE else there, but since Duckee got such great reviews we wanted to try it out. By the time we finished, this small restaurant was busy, but still had room for a few more parties of four.

Ordered:  Gyoza (beef pot stickers), shrimp wantons, mango salad, duckee special (includes platter of duck \"tacos\" AND lettuce wraps with duck stir-fry), cantonese chow mein, ice tea

Cost: about $65 after tax

Duckee special was by far my favourite thing. It might seem expensive at $38 for the two platters, but it was quite filling, and duck is by nature not that cheap.

Only complaint: cold breeze whenever someone opens the door. This is definitely why most restaurants have two sets of doors. Brrrrr....
Also mango salad had a lot of extra syrup/dressing at the bottom which I didn't care for. I prefer my salads dry. I would order it again with no dressing.

Conclusion: well, the bf is laying beside me in a satisfied food coma...so pretty good... definitely going again!!"}
{"text":"Ordered through foodora for lunch .. had hot and sour soup, mango salad, fresh salad rolls ..  order did not include the requested utensils .. soup was more sweet than hot or sour .. mango salad was ok, nothing special .. salad rolls came with two types of sauce and again it was just ok .. my brother had fried rice with chicken, shrimp and crab that was marked spicy and I requested extra spicy and was told it was more salty than spicy .. this place is not worth time and effort for bad service and just ok sort of food"}
{"text":"Too expensive for the not okay food quality, small portion, and below average service. The small bowl of Jasmine rice costs 2$...ridiculous, tasted horrible."}
{"text":"Very surprised at how bad this was. It confirms once again that asian fusion = unauthentic westernized assortments of asian cuisine for unsuspecting North Americans. Simply terrible. 

Soggiest food ever. The only thing half decent was the bbq pork bun. Everything else was just strange."}
{"text":"Great restaurant that deserves a lot more business than it gets! Servers were extremely friendly and attentive. Tried the all you can eat dim sum brunch which is available until 4pm. The best Sui Mai and Har Gow I've ever had. They make all your food after you order so it stays fresh. Might try the Peking Duck next time!"}
{"text":"This is my strip of Eglinton (my house is pretty much right there) but I feel bad for businesses along here; they don't get a whole lot of foot traffic and it's hard to survive. Hence, this place was formerly a Vietnamese resto called Halong Bay. And it didn't survive all that long. Let's all support our local businesses!

Anyway, Duckee offers a large selection of dim sum and Chinese dishes. To help you make your selections, they highlight several bestselling dishes on the blackboard.

What we got:

Shrimp toast - two little toast squares embedded with shrimp and sesame, fully deep fried and satisfyingly crispy

Steamed BBQ pork bun - the bun:pork ratio was a bit heavy on the doughy bun side, but the BBQ pork inside was yummy and I'd get this again for sure (I love steamed buns)

Mongolian beef - served on a sizzling plate, smothered in Mongolian salty brown sauce (sorry, I don't know what else to call it) with a great amount of onions and peppers. Excellent!!! Don't forget to order a side of steamed rice with this.

Mango chicken - nope. The sauce was weird and the chicken was watery and therefore obviously cooked-from-frozen. Blech

Service was very helpful and friendly. I just wish they'd install a heavy curtain at the front to prevent cold winds from entering the restaurant every time someone opened the door.

Anyway, once again....support your local businesses! :)"}
{"text":"I didn't understand why this place was empty on a Friday night until I tried the food.

My journey with Duckee started last week when I found them on just-eat.ca; however, I ended up skipping my order because I couldn't remember my username and/or password. The next day, SURPRISE! Their menu was delivered through my door (you can see they are attempting a major marketing initiative right now). Today, as I was in the area for my doctor's appointment I gave in to the temptation.

The restaurant is very quaint with a good amount of comfortable seating and a varied menu. Unfortunately, that's the end of the positives.

I brought the food home and it was almost inedible! The vegetables were soggy and tasteless. The chicken was dry and chewy which is surprising as it was drowning in an overly sweet teriyaki sauce. The accompanying rice wasn't bad but it wasn't great.

For all the businesses along Eglinton that have been forced to close while the LRT/subway was being installed, I'll give them credit, this one survived. However, considering no one was there on a Friday night and it didn't appear as they were overflowing with take out/delivery orders I'll guess I'm not the only one to have had a negative experience.

But considering I hate giving any family business a one star review. I wish them the best and hope things pick up. I, on the other hand, will not be returning."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some Chinese takeout, so I figured I'd give Duckee a shot. I ordered Shanghai Fried Noodles, Pad Thai, Hot and Sour Soup, and Gyoza.

The best item was the Shanghai Fried Noodles, though there were hardly the best version of this dish I've ever tried. The sauce was unusually sweet and there was zero spice to be had, but this was, at the very least, edible.

Not quite as edible was the Pad Thai. This was shockingly bad, actually. It didn't resemble Pad Thai in any way, and I actually got angry as I was eating it. Did the person who made this think it was good? Would he/she eat it him/herself? Unlikely.

The Gyoza was passable, though nothing special, while the Hot and Sour Soup was flat-out disgusting. Down the toilet it went."}
{"text":"Oh so wonderful to my taste buds.

This place just recently opened and I have already ordered from them many times. Not too greasy, everything that I want an Asian restaurant to have is on the menu, super friendly staff, seriously amazing taste. Also, for all those Vegetarians out there (I'm living with one so I know how important it is to spread the word) this is a good place for you. They have vegetarian versions of many signature Asian dishes that taste just as amazing as the originals. 

I strongly recommend this place :)."}
{"text":"Went here for Chinese takeout. Duckee is nicely decorated Asian Fusion restaurant. I have came here before for the all you can eat dim sum brunch on the weekends. I have never eaten any of their other dishes so I can't comment on them.

I ordered the pork siu mai, phoenix pearls (sticky rice), steamed beef balls, dragon whiskers (fried squid tentacles), and sesame balls. The food was pretty good and tasty especially the phoenix pearls.

Would I come back here? Probably since I like eating dim sum and it is the only place in my area that serve dim sum. The dim sum dishes were pretty good, but not at same level at other places I have eaten. They are also very expensive compared to Chinatown dim sum."}
{"text":"Looking for an early dinner along Eglinton, and most places weren't open until 5pm. Not Duckee! It's pan-Asian cuisine, so you know what you're getting in to. No expertise in any one kind of food, and everything was tuned for a western palate. I had a special, duck in red curry, and was happy with it. Good sized portions, with lots of duck. It didn't blow me away, and was a little too sweet for my liking with a hint of spiciness.

I wouldn't go out of my way to visit Duckee again. I'm not disappointed. Just underwhelmed if that's a word."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and often order here when I'm craving Chinese. Their pheonix pearls are to die for, and I can never only order one. I usually order out, simply because it's near to my house. The few times I've eaten there the service and food presentation has been wonderful."}
{"text":"Got my delivery order wrong today. Except the Peking duck, nothing is really special there."}
{"text":"I found hair in my food.  

Gave the restaurant a second chance.

Found another hair in my food.  

No more chances.  

(This happened a while ago but I feel compelled to leave a review.)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for quick takeout. It was empty compared to the other locations on the block so I decided to give them a try. Unfortunately the lamb I wanted was unavailable, so I opted for the beef and the taste was OFF. I let my friend try some and she said that it tasted old. Overall I think the smell was off and definitely wasn't freshly made that day. I guess there's a reason their always empty. My friend also said that she went there for all you can eat dim sum with her daughter (a vegan) and the waitress said that they both had too order the all you can eat."}
