{"text":"Love the food here! Always fresh and great service. Strongly recommend Korean BBQ and jerk chicken!"}
{"text":"Taco Fusion is definitely a hidden gem. I've really enjoyed the fish taco, as the fish was nicely seasoned and it was grilled. Presentation is nicely done and the owner always puts her time to understand what type of taco you like with a huge smile! This is my second time here, and I will definitely come back for more fish tacos!"}
{"text":"Taco Fusion, as the name suggests, melds Mexican food with other cuisines, and not limited to just tacos. They are located in the food court of the Pickering flea market.  I contemplated the Korean BBQ Beef but opted for the Jerk Chicken Burrito Bowl. It starts off with a layer of rice, beans, onions, peppers, and then a generous layer of shredded boneless jerk chicken. It's topped with lettuce, tomatoes, and a combination of sauces. It works!  The chicken had some nice crispy bits and was well seasoned. It may be a tad on the spicy side for some people. The lettuce, tomatoes, and sauces did help to cool it off a bit. Overall, this dish had good flavour and the portion was generous. I'll be back for the Korean BBQ beef..."}
