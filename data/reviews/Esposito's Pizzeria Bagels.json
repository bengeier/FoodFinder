{"text":"There pizza is pretty tasty, and there bagels are very tasty. Just not sure what there deal is because the service is pretty lax. It doesn't seem like the workers enjoy being there. I go for mostly bagels on Sunday. They are 3 miles from me, and i like my bagels small with taste. Some of the other bagel stores bagels are larger with dull taste and hollow inside. Bigger is not better when it comes to bagels in my opinion. Again, I will keep going there for the bagels, but I shy and go to the better pizzerias. If the service improves then I would give it another star."}
{"text":"So glad they went out of business..HORRIBLE service, awful food. Just nothing good about them."}
{"text":"The pizza is actually pretty good here.  It's everything else that stinks.  Things started badly when a heavy \"open\" sign fell from ten feet above our table and just missed my kid's head while we sat in our booth.  It may very well have killled them.  We told the waitress, who didn't ask if we were ok, or even investigate why the fixtures were mysteriously jumping off the walls. She actually had no response or reaction.  

The first red flag was that there was only one table with three people eating when we got there.  This is a Friday night at  7:15 pm.  So, naturally we waited 45 minutes for a pie and the worst chicken wings I've ever tasted. Again, no one is here!   They deep-fried the wings, and then drizzled bbq sauce over them like you would a dessert.  Atrocious.    

I am absolutely mystified that this place has remained open.  With Mama's opening down the street,  that just may change.  It was pretty funny watching the New Yorker at the one occupied table LOSE HIS MIND when the marinara sauce for his meal came in a little plastic cup with a lid on the side instead of being served on top of the pasta. 

Try Mama's, or drive the twenty minutes to Tony's in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"Wow, the service here really sucks. Haven't tried the bagels but was waiting for over 45 minutes for a dine in pizza with my wife before we left."}
{"text":"Maybe the service has improved or they just weren't busy.  I called in an order for pizza and wings and was told 40 minutes which was long for what I ordered.  The service was okay; no issues there.  The pizza could use some improvement.  It was slightly overdone and that made it a little stiff.  More important was the lack of cheese and the cheese and sauce ending an inch or two before the crust on an 18 inch pizza.  If they improved these things, it would be awesome pizza.  The wings were great, and this is coming from someone who lived in Buffalo.  The sauce was good and they were fried.  A little more blue cheese would have been good. I will probably stick to Libretto's since the pizza is better and it's closer, but I would go to Esposito's again and maybe try the pasta."}
{"text":"Found this receipt in my Yelp! file and do want to join the celebration that his location is closed.  Pizza was very good, but the service and employees sucked.

We only did carry out, and never did bagels.

Bye, bye."}
{"text":"One of the owners told me he had a restaurant on Arthur Ave. in the Bronx. Which is a famous area for Italian food. This is very hard to fathom. This is by far the worst Italian food I have ever tasted and the service is not far behind. I don't know how they stay in business."}
{"text":"This new Italian and bagels restaurant in Indian Land is in the right location, outside Sun City. Though the bagels were good, the service was atrocious. First, the layout of the restaurant is poor. As we were waiting in line for bagels to go, this rude older couple cut in front of our family of 7. The owner seemed to know them and didn't care. It almost happened again when some woman walked in, but he acknowledged us before we simply walked out. If you just want bagels, head to HT."}
{"text":"Great food and service. It reminds me of home with NY style pizza but they offer more than great pizza. Great bagels, breakfast, pasta meals and such. They had a location that closed in charlotte but we like them closer to home as well. My son is in love with the Lemon cake and brownies. Great service due to keeping glasses filled and always had great service with a smile. The family and I are there on a weekly basis with love and dedication. They also offer different daily specials-variety.Everything fixed from scratch too-if not it sure tastes that way. Awesome eating with great flavor. Will be back."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the service at this establishment because we have only order carry-out, but we love their pizza!

If you like a lot if different toppings, the supreme is awesome!  The veggies seem very fresh and the meat options are tasty! We've also ordered just a sausage and mushroom pie and it was very good as well!  Thin crust, Philly style pizza."}
{"text":"What ever happened to customer service ? I stood there for 10 minutes before I was acknowledged . Four people were working and saw me standing there. Finally  the question -what do you want  was asked by someone in a sweaty T- shirt. I asked for a plain bagel with lox  and was told we don't have plain bagels. I asked if they had planned to bake more and the answer was an outright No!
I was given a bagel with a blob of cream cheese and a poor excuse for lox.  
Stop trying to imitate N.Y. if you don't have a clue
Will I go Back?  No!
A one star rating is too good for this place."}
