{"text":"Ordered the matcha red bean roll cake, very mild matcha, the whole cake is lack of flavour, just too bland.
Shared a flat white with my bf, it was just ok, I think i'll stick with Fahrenheit just around the corner for my morning coffee fix."}
{"text":"Really nice new space for a neighborhood cafe.  The flat white I tried was good, as was the choux pastry I tried, though echoing another reviewer, not mind-blowing.  The next table over seemed to be enjoying their green tea cookie and roll cake though, so perhaps I'll give that a shot next time.

It's a nice mellow spot to check out if you're in the neighborhood ."}
{"text":"The most delicious cake and coffee, but terrible customer service. My bf visited the shop a few times before because it's close to his work, and spoken of how the person taking the order was not very friendly every time he went. (And my bf is generally a pretty happy and smiley person.) I didn't believe him because I heard of such good things about the baked goods and everyone in the pictures look so happy! Tonight I visited for the first time and I received a very stoic and cold experience from the person who took my order. Did I do something wrong? Is she very tired? Not the experience I was expecting :( a little disappointed and sad about the whole thing."}
{"text":"It's too cool for me. But people who know a thing or two about coffee will probably love it. They have \"pour over\" coffee, nice espresso, passable hot chocolate and fancy cakes. 

Aesthetic is 10/10."}
{"text":"Great space, great pastries and cakes, great coffee
Horrible staff; very patronizing and snappy, bored with their job and exude the air that they are too good for what they do.
Just kind of bitters the whole experience."}
{"text":"So, I'll start off by saying/defending anyone that says they don't take care of anyone other than their regulars because that's a flat out LIE... and here's why...

This is because my ENTIRE family of 12 that flew all the way over from Miami, FL came to this spot in the morning just before we started our day of attempting to be a Toronto local. I led us all in and immediately marched myself to the counter to decide what I wanted. I was greeted by one of the gentlemen behind the counter. As my huge family scrambled and yelled to one another about what each should get no one seemed disturbed or annoyed but more HELPFUL than anything. We were all so fascinated with the latte art (not at all afraid to show it) and they didn't seem annoyed from how obnoxious and excited we all were.

*Most importantly, the quality of the lattes and coffees were to PERFECTION. Boy, do these people know what they're doing!*

As we walked out and said our thank you's for such a great experience, one of the baristas chased after us to snag a photo of my whole family in front of their storefront sign. It was truly the sweetest thing and we came to find out they posted the photo on their Instagram! How sick! 

Thank you Neo Coffee, you guys definitely made our Toronto trip so much better!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of the coffee shops in Tokyo. Legit and Authentic. Great coffee great pastry."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. They have a very nice wooden interior with single seats near the front and slightly larger tables/communal space towards the back. We had a chance to try the roll cakes, and they were delicious! Both the matcha and strawberry cakes were very soft/fluffy texture. The slices are on the pricier end, but it's a nice treat once in awhile! 

This goes without saying, but the coffee is consistently good!"}
{"text":"The green tea cake is pretty dang great with the addition of a touch of red bean. If you love Aromaz at Chartwell Mall then you'll like this place (and vice versa)"}
{"text":"I went in Saturday afternoon the day they just opened. I got snotty attitude from the cashier and was very put off by that. I asked for what roll cake they have and the response was whatever is in the display. (Total snob!) The!saving grace was the chef. He overheard me asking the cashier about the cakes and told me he had more roll cakes ready in 5 minutes if I wanted to wait. He personally came out of the kitchen to give me my orders. I was impressed. 

I ordered a slice each plus a cream puff. I also ordered a classic green tea and my husband had an iced coffee. The drinks were sub par but I loved the pastries. The cream puff was filled with fresh cream and the rolled cake was light and not too sweet."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite coffee shop in Toronto. Nice atmosphere and fantastic food and drinks."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to find this cafe made a Yelp list of great coffee in Toronto.  I know great drip and great espresso, lattes, etc  and I have my personal favourites; the best in this city in my opinion.  Unfortunately, NEO is NOT one of them.  Granted, it has a beautiful Interior which makes it the most fashionable coffee spot in Toronto.  However, I ordered a latte and two \"fresh\" cookies last week to take away. I could not finish my latte and my boyfriend and I could not eat (enjoy) our cookies (two different kinds if you're wondering).  My boyfriend and I both agreed the coffee was horrible. (I had him taste my coffee, just to make sure it my taste buds weren't off).  Seriously, three sips and I couldn't finish it.  The service was dull (unfriendly, distracted, disinterested). I could write more on this, but I've made my rating clear here.
*Refer to Sara C's review and her comments re: treatment of \"new customers\". I copy that!

The two star rated grade is purely for the gorgeous space. Period.  Believe me, I was really looking forward to loving this place.  The good news is that there are so MANY  other great cafes/coffee stops in this city. As for NEO, they can enjoy serving their \"regulars\"."}
{"text":"One of the best coffee shops in Toronto!

Really knowledgable baristas, skilled, super friendly, and they all, and i mean every single one of the employees, provide above and beyond service. 

Their baked goods aren't too overly sweet, and they make most of it in house, right behind a glass room where you get to watch!"}
{"text":"Not Your Typical Toronto Cafe.

From the minimal design and spacious layout, to the open kitchen and the Japanese snacks, the first thing I thought when I walked in was that this isn't your typical Toronto cafe (felt like I was in Tokyo or Kyoto). I had an Americano which tasted great and also the peach cake and a matcha cookie.

All in all this new cafe is a great addition to the neighbourhood and the city. It's got a really cool design, great tasting coffee, creative food and most of all, a unique experience."}
{"text":"Coffee and baked goods are awesome at this place. However, customer service does not even exist here. The owner and a few female staff do not even acknowledge customers (or are selective of who they greet or not), and are just arrogant and snobby, making it seem like they do not want to even serve people. It is disappointing as coffee and food are great, but the worst part of visiting this place is when you place an order and pay. Not even \"hi\", \"thank you\" or smile. It is just very unpleasant, and it is discouraging me to go back to this place after several visits.
____________________

Their baked goods are going down hill as well. They were initially good when they opened their door, but not any more. I do not go there any more, as the service continues to be terrible, baked goods are not that great any more, and the coffee is just ok."}
{"text":"Had a latte and pastry.  Latte incredibly smooth.  Pastry made with organic ingredients and super fresh."}
{"text":"We ducked into Neo Coffee Bar by chance on a rainy Saturday morning when we needed a pit stop for the family after visiting the St. Lawrence Market, and we're so glad we did. The friendliness of the staff is backed up by the best London Fog we've had anywhere, and absolutely delicious Japanese roll cakes, which were so delicious: the polar opposite of the bland, forgettable versions too often found in Toronto. Good cookies, plenty of seating, clean and spacious washroom (behind a hidden door in the back wall) and a modern yet comfortable decor round out this great spot. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great service and great matcha latte!! roll cake tastes good but a bit sweet."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent food and great coffee with horrible horrible service, the server/cashier and the person preparing the coffee was snobby and had a horrible attitude while dealing with customers. As much as I loved everything I ordered (especially the coffee) I do not plan on returning to get more of this service."}
{"text":"Nice cozy atmosphere, but could use more sitting as it looked to be a popular spot for college students. Had to take a sit with those little side tables, was not very comfortable. 
I ordered a london fog latte and it was perfect! It had that sweet delicious vanilla flavour paired with Sloane tea! Also tried the matcha roll cake with adzuki beans. Not too sweet and made with organic ingredients. Perfect for my sweet tooth. 
There's also free wifi if you need, and bathroom was clean. 

Overall, I would come back and try the other pastries and drinks. Maybe come in a little bit earlier/less busy times to get better seats!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto so purely by name, we decided to try the Toronto (or perhaps it was Ontario?) roll cake with strawberries in the cream. The roll wasn't overwhelming sweet and extremely moist, which were the two best features of this cake. Enjoyable but nothing extraordinary. 

What I enjoyed the most was the Kyoto matcha green tea latte. It had some bitterness of the matcha which is rare to find and the sweetness-level was just perfect. Loved the woody-atmosphere of this cute little shop."}
{"text":"Good coffee, cute space, and great food! I'm sad I can't try the roll cakes, but very happy to find a few vegan friendly options. I tried the raspberry and coconut muffin and loved it (it's also sugar free!). Space is wide enough for strollers and saw a few people having meetings. A few people mentioned bad service in their ratings, I can't say I had outstandingly friendly service but definitely not impolite. I wouldn't worry! Overall, highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"The taste of coffee is not great, but their pastries are better than other franchise coffee shops. I like their Green tea pastries collection. The place is very clean and has lots of space. I really like it. Neo Coffee Bar is located in a trendy area and there are many students in the bar. The bathroom is nice. The bathroom itself has a good space and clean. The bathroom is on the ground floor and I do not need to use narrow downstairs which we often have to use in coffee shops in downtown. It is hard to find a bathroom, but I feel happy when I find it!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid coffee shop at the East End. They sell artisan coffee, Japanese-size sandwiches, & Japanese-inspired desserts. The desserts are less sweeter than your average North American desserts, which is perfect for an afternoon snack.

The place has that sleek & modern clean cut look. They're very accommodating for work. Whenever I stayed for longer than 1 hour, one of the barista would offer a glass of water. 5-Star service seems impossible to copy & paste in Toronto.

Honestly, this place is my secret go-to Matcha place. You could tell that these guys sell none of those pale diluted Matcha, but the real deal-extremely green stuff from Japan. I always get Plain Unsweetened Iced Matcha. No milk of course, because the real deal doesn't require milk to enjoy."}
{"text":"Not my thing. I see why a lot of people would like it though. It's very pretty in there, definitely for people who are into aesthetics and whatnot.

After my first time there, I didn't find anything that would make me want to go back. I didn't have any of their drinks but from what I've seen, they do have a variety and they do pretty art on top. I got the London Fog roll cake and the matcha cookie. The roll cake didn't really appeal to my taste and the cookie was a bit too dry for my liking.  But they definitely had different kinds of flavours so that's something unique to this place. The service was okay, again nothing special. The baristas did their job, nothing above and beyond from my experience."}
{"text":"Had a Flat White with the option of cashew milk. Divine. 

I like the openness of the shop.

Wish it had more food/veggie options, but that's a minor detail."}
{"text":"I sense the baristas are just mellow. They may give a standoffish, uncaring vibe, but they're just chill people. They won't greet you with a hearty hello or hearty goodbye. They have introverted resting faces. Service was just fine; no pressure, no up selling, straight to the point. 

I had the Shingen cake ($3.50), and latte ($3.50). Cake was similar you'd find at Asian bakeries (light and fluffy, not dense with icing like Western cakes); Shingen had soy bean cream, red bean paste. My latte was well made, nothing extraordinary. 

Aside from blah service and Japanese style cake, you'd really want to visit for the interior design. Very modern wood walls, communal tables, U booths, a bench for individual seaters, and copper touches. Ceilings are open concept with exposed piping and concrete walls. White marble counter tops.

Mellow indie rock playlist (chillwave? Synthpop? Stuff you hear in a Sofia Coppola movie?), played a lot of Wild Nothing.

The entrance to the washroom is trippy. It is hidden behind a wooden wall with no indication that it is a washroom. No washroom sign. Almost everyone gets confused and walks downstairs to the kitchen/cellar. The washrooms are really nice. Fresh flowers. It's nice enough to sleep in there.

I'd drop by again if I was in the neighborhood and also not in the mood for barista chit chat."}
{"text":"Great coffee and yummy roll cakes. Very friendly staff. The only complaint is that the decor is too modern and not as cozy as I like when it comes to coffee shops. Patrons are so quiet that I almost felt like I was in a library. If there were plush sofas and comfy seats, I would up my rating to 5/5 :)"}
{"text":"Of all the cafés I've visited, this is the only one that brings and serves you water. This level of service reflects the overall attitude of Neo Coffee Bar. No detail has been spared here, from the feel of the space, its food, and of course, service.

While Neo is known for its roll cakes, (personal favs includes raspberry pistachio and Shingen), my true love is Neo's vegan sandwich. 

Where trendy eateries have yet to venture far beyond the kale craze, Neo's vegan sandwich boasts of buttery Brussel sprouts, sweet and tangy pickled beets, and marinated squash (or is it yam?) ---all converging in an ecstatic mix of flavours and textures. 

So if you're in the area and there's still a sandwich left, count yourself lucky and snatch that gem! 

Also, side note that if you're ordering cake for a special occasion, you will have to ask for decorations---available for an additional, nominal charge, and worth every penny."}
{"text":"It was good and milky but not strong enough. Matcha cookie was fresh and full of flavour. Service was prompt and friendly - my only complaint is that it is quite pricey. I paid about $10 total. The back of the cafe has bigger tables to work on, the front of the store had small one (two, at most) seaters."}
{"text":"I always have a weakness for cafes that bake their own pastries in house, and Neo is no exception.  The modern wood and concrete interior greets you as you order their pastries; my cheese croissant had fresh herbs on it, putting it into the next level.

Coffee was excellent as expected, as they use locally roasted coffee.

Seating is limited in the back though, so make sure to show up early."}
{"text":"Super cute interior. They didn't have the pastry that I wanted due to the season but got to taste the matcha tea latte. They have lactose free milk, cashew milk, and coconut milk so I loved the lactose friendly options!"}
{"text":"Ordered an Americano and a ham and Brie sandwich on French bread. Absolutely delicious.

There are a variety of short cakes available for purchase as well as croissants. The service is friendly and they can move through the line quickly while taking care to make your beverage or snack perfect.

Calm surroundings with ample seating for parties of 1-2 people. Great for a snack to accompany your delicious coffee."}
{"text":"Wow... Bruce knows service!!!! The quality of food and options seem to be unmatched in this city. Sugar and gluten free muffins, gourmet sandwiches, seasonal, organic and and ethical food made simply delicious. Oh and the famous roll cake... Speaks for itself!!! 

I could go on about how wonderful this place is.... But it really should be experienced!!! Fill you're heart and tummy full of Neo goodness!


As for resting faces... Life is what you make it!! If someone gives you a sideways look, give them a smile and some positivity."}
{"text":"love this place! great drinks and great food! I've been here a few times and have enjoyed whatever I got every time. the rolls are definitely and must try. they aren't too sweet, just enough sweetness. can't wait to come during spring/summer when they have seasonal flavoured rolls

love the look of this place as all"}
{"text":"Ok people - Neo rocks. Bruce is a hipster who knows his beans, and Masa creams pastries with the best of them. Great place! Also - the washroom is a 'hidden gem'"}
{"text":"Beautiful design and decor, it has a wooden / polished industrial look going. The place is a little short on seating space so it might not be ideal for studying during peak hours. 

The matcha latte had a nice subtle bitter taste to it, and was not overwhelmingly creamy. They ran out of the matcha flavoured roll sponge cake while I was there so I settled on the apple - light in texture and sweetness. I'd go back for the atmosphere and to try out the matcha sponge cake again."}
{"text":"Came here with friends to study. Very calm and nice cafe. There wasn't much savory sandwich options but the sandwiches they have are good. Make sure to come early to get the sandwiches you want. I treated my friends to dessert here with the Kinka family gift card I won."}
{"text":"match roll cake with Japanese chestnut compote was a okay, match taste didn't stand out. 
I've tried better ones at petite nuage
and service was just okay...
well maybe they have the best coffee, not likely that I'll return, at least not for the roll cakes
the atmosphere and decor were great though"}
{"text":"A great addition to this neighborhood. First of the design of the store itself nice and open concept and in addition it is comfortable (take note the cafe nearby which is all style over substance).
The desserts were very good and I will update once I have tried other items. This visit I tried the matcha white chocolate cookie and London fog cake. They use organic items so the higher price is justified. Both items were quite good. 
As for the cappuccino hmm it could have been better though if they rotate their beans it might improve on the next visit.  Here is the verdict on the cappuccino:
Espresso: Medium/strong flavor
Crema': Decent
Milk: Frothed very well with nice microfoam.
Latte Art: Good
I personally didn't like the coffee bean they used hence I would rate it 3.5 stars. The desserts are solid so overall 4 stars and I will be back."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0

Open concept coffee bar serving up Japanese influenced lattes, cookies and cake rolls. Service was great as you would expect from many Japanese establishments. 

Liked the texture of their matcha latte but could have definitely been more potent in flavour.

Cakes are moist but pretty standard for the most part. Would like to have seen more intricacies with their desserts but I think the simplicity in their menu works fine for most folks.

Great place to chill or study (if you can find a vacant table)."}
{"text":"LOVE this local coffee bar! Great service, great atmosphere, ah-mazing coffee. Being from NZ we might be considered coffee snobs - this place really hits the spot. They get it right every time. 
Also, the cabinet food is delish. I'm dying to try the sponge roll cake in every flavour."}
{"text":"This was just supposed to be a quick coffee pit stop before we could grab a table at Le Petite Dejeuner but it ended up being our breakfast spot. Neo has a very cool industrial look to it and is a lot more spacious than it seems, with plenty of seating towards the back of the space - booths and tables.

My friend and I grabbed a couple Americanos, and the barista actually asked me how much hot water I wanted - WIN! I hate it when they water it down too much. Since they just opened up, the counter was filled with delicious baked goods fresh from their oven, and gourmet sandwiches like smoked salmon, ham & brie, mozzeralla, tomato and basil etc.  We decided on sandwiches and a couple coconut & cranberry muffins. Wow, those muffins were incredible. Dense with ground coconut, sunflower seeds and bursts of berry flavour in each bite.  They do not skimp on ingredients!

The service here is also impeccable. The baristas would come around and clear tables off, bring water to the patrons, and occasionally check on us to see if we needed anything. Honestly, I couldn't have asked to stumble upon a better spot for a nice Sunday breakfast. 

Next time I'm stopping by for their roll cakes and lattes!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place even though it's pricey. The desserts are great and it's a great place to chill or get some work done. But today they forgot about my order so I picked up the wrong one (after waiting for 10 mins), they then passive aggressively blamed it on me . C'mon guys."}
{"text":"I had the roll cake and the matcha cookie, both were so fresh and full of flavour! The roll cake is especially delicious, really fluffy but not too rich like european style roll cake. I highly recommend this place for their really nice atmosphere, friendly staff, and delicious baked goods!"}
{"text":"Neo is good spot to work away for a few hours or to grab an espresso and roll cake and catch up with a friend. I like the coffee happy hours! I don't have that much more to say but it's a solid place a bit off the beaten track."}
{"text":"This space is absolutely stunning; quite the juxtaposition from The Rooster Coffee, also in this neighborhood. The leather couches and high ceilings make studying or lounging that much more hip. The service was great and the lattes were quite good--a bit more bitter, but good. They also bring glasses of water around, which is refreshing. You get that cafe feeling with a hint of Japanese hospitality. I did try their dark chocolate sea salt cookie, but it was quite dry. Should have gone with one of their roll cakes. There's always next time."}
{"text":"I like the cream puffs and the coffee reminds me of a tall dark and handsome man I met in Malta"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  The matcha is sweetened, which kills the beauty of the flavour.  The team made an unsweetened version for me, that was unfortunately overpowered by the almond milk.  I tried a matcha cookie, that tasted like macaroni & cheese.  Finally, I tried a chocolate/orange roll cake that was nice.  Brilliant branding and vision here - just a few tweaks needed to serve amazing things"}
{"text":"Excited that we have a new coffee place in the hood.  Came in bright and early in the morning to welcome them to the hood.  They were quite indifferent.    No smiles.  Asked for recommendations and got a sigh with an under the breath response of \"Matcha Aduki\" said he has already said it a million times.  Tried it as I can be too quick to judge. The verdict is in.  London fog was weak.  Matcha Aduki weak.  Bland flavours for both and for the price and service I am going to stick to my regular spot.  So welcome to the neighbourhood and good luck as you will need it"}
{"text":"Swiss roll cakes are my childhood jam, so seeing how carefully made these cakes are at Neo evokes in me a certain nostalgia, like everything will be OK, as long as we have these fluffy logs of joy. Heck, I don't even eat them anymore; I just admire them through the glass partition, while I shuffle along and order my vegan breakfast cookie. Thankfully, they also have good coffee, and...wait for it... NO ADDED CHARGE FOR ALTERNATIVE MILKS. #YAS (Yep, this is such a rarity, it calls for all-caps and hashtags). What's more they carry several types of non-dairy milks. Thank you, Neo Coffee Bar for being considerate enough to not impose a fee for those who choose not to drink/can't do dairy! Friendly staff and nice, minimalist space. If you care for industrial chic, the space is right up your gentrified alley."}
{"text":"Super cute coffee bar that has a japanese atmosphere. Super closeby to george brown culinary school and i will definitely go back to try everything. Just ordered their latte but want to try their desserts!!!"}
{"text":"Arrived on a weekday morning to a mostly empty cafe - only two tables at the front occupied (perhaps because the set up of a small table is not super friendly to freelancers?)  This quaint little cafe is located next to the George Brown campus, with modern minimalist decor.  Front of cafe seating is all single tables and back of cafe seating is more friendly for catching up with friends.

I came by mostly to try the matcha red bean roll cake - being a big fan of both, and of course the slush drink commonly found at bubble tea cafes, I was curious to see how the dessert equivalent was executed.  Verdict? Not so sweet which I liked, but the matcha flavour was a little lacking and there was very little red bean to add to the flavour combo.

The service was mostly friendly, the barista/owner suggested an SprOld Fashioned to my friend (think the cocktail with espresso substitute for the liquor) and a Lovely Latte for myself (don't be fooled by the name, this is just a regular, no frills latte).  My friend thought his drink was interesting,and I thought my drink was a little weak on the espresso.  Total for two roll cakes and two drinks with tax+tip came out to just under $20.

Overall, the cafe is a lovely addition to the neighbourhood and the roll cakes are definitely worth a try if you're not into super sweet dessert, but execution lacked especially on the drinks.  I will likely go back to Fahrenheit nearby for coffee unless Asian dessert cravings call."}
{"text":"Need an afternoon pick me up? Look no further - bright and roomy decor, there are parisian style seating to seclusive booth seating for the laptopers, even communal table for the single and availables. This cafe gets an A for seat variety and decor.

We had came for the cake, and i had pistachio and raspberry, and she had the shingen. Both were really moist and not overly sweet. The shingen has decadent cream that resembles to coffee and thick chewy rice cake, it's definitely a winner! 

I also took home the matcha and it was still moist the next day. But perhaps the matcha flavour has escaped overnight! My matcha craving has yet to be satisfied! 

I'd go back to try the rest of the cake and i also spot cream puffs and matcha cookies."}
{"text":"NEO makes one of the best matcha lattes in Toronto. It has a contemporary design. Delicious Japanese inspired baked goods. The prices are on par with other coffee shops. 

I would recommend this coffee shop to those who want to try a coffee shop that's off the beaten path."}
{"text":"Bruce Ly is magical with his amazing latte art!!! And the roll cakes are made fresh and delish!!!! Also probably some of the best coffee in Toronto."}
{"text":"3.5 star rating. 

I love the layout and design of this new coffee shop, very modern and minimalistic. After hearing about how great the roll cakes were, I tried the matcha azuki and the shingen (soy bean flavour) with my friends. We all concluded that the shingen is a definite must try and is way better and more flavourful than the matcha azuki. The matcha was lacking in flavour I think. The roll cakes are not that sweet so perfect for those who like desserts that aren't too sugary. 

I also had their cinnamon maple latte, but it was  nothing amazing. Overall, if you live in the area..it's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about their matcha latte (which is my favourite drink at most coffee shops if they offer it), so we came here to give this place a try. 

We came here on a Sunday, and I was planning to work a bit on my laptop. What I didn't know.. was that they have a weekend \"laptop and tablet free\" policy for a designated time of the day, which they indicate is to encourage people to socialize and enjoy their coffee more - I didn't mind, it's pretty cute that they do that, in my opinion :) 

What we ordered:
- Cold Matcha Latte: I thought it wasn't bad, but the matcha flavour wasn't strong enough so it tasted a bit more milky than some of the other places
- Cold Brew: I didn't try this myself, but my friend really liked it! 

Aside from matcha, I also love chocolate-anything! But I feel that the flavours of both the chocolate and black sesame rolls could be a bit stronger: 
- Gluten Free Orange Dark Chocolate (64% dark chocolate truffle with a hint of orange)
- Kurogoma (black sesame sponge cake and roasted sesame-infused sweet cream)"}
{"text":"Neo Coffee Bar is a new coffee / pastry / sandwich shop located near King & Jarvis on Frederick St. 

First, the coffee: it's good! We came in on opening day and tried the standard drip coffee, which was free. I'm no coffee connoisseur, but I really enjoyed it. Strong but not overly so, and none of that terrible aftertaste you get with Starbucks etc. Not the best coffee I've ever had, but definitely better than most. They also have a pretty intense-looking espresso setup, and the Americano and latte were we had were good but not the best in the area. We will probably stick to nearby Tandem for our pure coffee needs.

The other major claim to fame of this place is the Japanese pastry chef. We tried the cream puff (which is filled right as you order it) and the matcha cookie. The cookie was ok, but the cream puff was excellent and definitely on par with the bakeries we've been to in Japan (and better than Beard Papa). The open pastry kitchen is pretty neat, and fun to watch from the seats at the front. They also have sandwiches for lunch, but have yet to try those. 

We've come back a few times now to try the rolls, which as per the advertising are the main feature of the pastry section. The matcha roll had a nice texture, but the flavour of matcha was very slight. It was disappointing, to be honest. The Shingen roll on the other hand was quite good: a noticeable roasted soya bean flavour that was unique and delicious.

Overall, the desserts were good, but not as mind-blowing as we hoped for based on the pre-opening hype. 

The space itself is worth mentioning as well. This is much larger than your regular coffee shop - there is seating space for at least 30 or 40. The decor is very concrete, but manages to be pretty warm with comfortable benches. Not many plugs though, and none of those giant arm chairs you see in many coffee shops though, so I don't know if this would be a good hangout/study place. Finally, the music selection tends more towards indie/alternative than 'hip' coffee shop far, which may or may not be your cup of tea. Personally, I liked it.

Overall, this place is a very good coffee and pastry shop, and we will be back."}
{"text":"I wish every coffee shop was like this. Exquisite coffees and teas, delicious baked goods made of organic ingredients, and stunning modern interiors with plenty of seating. The guys who work here are so lovely and they wear the cutest aprons. I tried their berry iced tea and it was silky smooth and flavourful - not bitter like most iced teas. The iced Americano was equally dreamy, as were the white cheddar croissants. There are some fine looking cakes and other baked goodies at this place that I'll need to check out. I live on the west end, but would travel far and wide for this east end paradise."}
{"text":"I'd like to start with the ambiance, it is absolutely gorgeous with white marble tables and a lot of natural light coming through their wide window. I've just learned about Neo coffee bar via Instagram and i've already visited 6 times in the month of February. I have tried their Matcha latte with both Almond milk and Cashew milk, as well as their traditional green tea bag, and drip coffee. With respect to goodies, i've tasted their matcha roll cake, matcha white academia cookie as well as vegan sugar free breakfast cookie - which was my absolute favourite, super nourishing, filling, chewy and satisfying. The service all 6 times has been phenomenal, as they have a smile on, greet you nicely, accomodate customers, and provide helpful answers with any questions. In addition to that, i had requested for a special latte art on my drink and the barista was kind enough to try his best to make what i requested. I would definitely recommend this place for a pick me up and lovely photos for food photographers. My only concern was seating, but if you go early enough or wait around you will definitely snatch a seat. There is a variety of couch corner tables, individual seating which can be tight but fine for one person, as well as a high top bench/bar."}
{"text":"Just got kicked out of this place because they have a no laptop rule between the hours of 12-4.  Every single person was on their phone and the barista could not explain to me the difference between me (working, quietly) on my laptop and all the people on their phones. This was also after me being there for an hour and having nothing said to me.

So glad I spent $10 on an overpriced coffee and a snack to be told I can't use my computer."}
{"text":"Neo has been expanding its vegan sweets collection! I was overjoyed to discover that besides their vegan sandwich, sugar-free cranberry coconut muffin, and breakfast protein cookie (very filling, slow burn since full of healthy whole grains, seeds, and nuts - great for a pre-workout snack), for only this month they are selling a totally vegan matcha mousse cake with fresh Ontario strawberries on top ($6.5) and it's such a treat! It's cashew-based, so dairy-free yet still incredibly smooth and creamy. If you prefer sweets that are slightly bitter, earthy, and definitely not overly sweet, get this matcha mousse cake! It's not very large, so you probably won't want to share :P Yayyy Neo, I hope you continue to expand your vegan selection :)"}
{"text":"The matcha cookie was soooo good as was the matcha latte. Prices are reasonable, considering the quality of the food and beverages. I also love the Japanese-inspired aesthetics. A must come!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, roll cakes, and great people working here!! Shingen roll cake tasted so good with red bean and mochi inside! Best $3.75 I could spend. :)"}
{"text":"Known for their lattes and roll cakes! This place is packed on the weekends esp. in the morning as it is quite famous now. Love the atmosphere, but not so welcoming. I don't see myself working/studying here for a couple hours unlike other cafes. The seats are not comfortable, and there are just too many people coming and leaving. 

I got their matcha latte and my boyfriend got a regular latte. We both enjoyed our drinks. Roll cakes were good too, but slightly on the pricey side I would have to say. 

Overall, it was a good experience. However, I would rather go to a quieter and a cozier cafe to relax while having my drink and snack."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me with their coffee and professionalism! Great morning walk to this place located near the St Lawrence Market, love their baked goods, love the wooden decor interiors, and nice place to sit alone or have small chats with friends.  Small tables, but they sit comfortably. Good Job Neo Coffee Staff!  Keep it up! :)"}
{"text":"Good coffee, really nice inside, we prefer roosters coffee but odin is a lot nicer inside and brighter to sit in."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????Neo coffee Bar????????d?????????????????????GB?????Coffee Bar??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????~?????????TSUJIRI????"}
{"text":"Lovely cafe with the most pillow-like sponge cakes. Coffee was great, had the latte and bf had the London fog. Their shingen cake was amazing. Perfect touch of sweetness with two surprising mochi stuffed INSIDE. Ugh I almost screamed but that would've been a little embarrassing. The interior was to die for. Perfect one seater where you'd get to be a loner in the morning before your cup of joe. If I lived in Toronto, I would come back every day. So glad I checked it out!"}
{"text":"This place is really conveniently located after my George Brown classes for me to get a coffee when I'm tired of Starbucks. They have a great variety of coffees and teas and you can taste the care they put into each product especially their baked goods. 

Walking into the location its gives off a nice zen feel like feel. Its a relaxed atmosphere with an upscale touch and its a great place to study or have a small group meeting. 

My only complaint is the hours of operation, for a great location the hours are short so you can't stay too late. I've never been to a coffee shop that closed so early but I might just be picky."}
{"text":"I love the dessert here! I got a chance to try their dessert at an event party. First I was attracted by the look of it, once I had it I know they took a lot of care and time to figure out their own recipes.

The cream puff is so good, creamy and cold enough, and it's not just whipped cream or whatever cream they use it for their puff, it also has a flavor in it. 

Their roll cake is amazing, the sponge part of the cake is always fresh because they make it every day freshly, they have green tea, chocolate, and probably vanilla. The most memorable flavor is chocolate, it has chocolate chunks and chocolate mousse/cream inside the cake, and the chocolate they uses aren't something low quality; the vanilla one has mochi in it, it gives an interesting texture; the green tea is green tea. 

I'm definitely going to visit their actual store and probably get one as a birthday cake."}
{"text":"Very cute coffee bar with great decor! I stopped by for a coffee and wanted to buy a slice of roll cake but couldn't afford to... it's $5.25 for a slice of the smaller rolls. It's pretty and all but I don't think I'll ever know if it's worth it. Just slightly shocked at their prices! I wish they had a larger selection of pastries. Huge fan of everything else though! I love their tiny kitchen behind  glass so you could see the chef at work!"}
{"text":"Guys just be aware the new policy said no laptop from 12-4 on weekends. The reason behind this policy was because customers complained about how people with laptops are always taking up the table and not leaving. I guess that refers to George browns students working on projects with their laptops. But banning laptop usage at all is a bit extreme. I am sure there is a solution in between. I genuinely hope there will be a coffee shop to ban electronics to encourage customers to seize the moment to talk enjoy coffee and cut from cyber world. But the reason behind Neo's policy is kinda throw me off."}
{"text":"Eh, it should be 3.5 star rating. Good place but not fresh food. I came there one Friday afternoon with my friend to try their famous sponge Roll cake but a little disappointed. My friend and I ordered Matcha and London fog respectively. The matcha cake matched well with the sweet chestnut and black tea  cake was perfect with sweet potato. They were both not too sweet. BUT the london fog seemed to stay in the board for loooong time because the sponge cake was becoming dry outside and sweet potato crisp on the top was not fresh at all. I was very disappointed, it should be perfect dessert if freshly baked."}
{"text":"Cute shop, decent amount of seating but the tables are small so best to bring some light work! A pretty quiet cafe so good for working. I had the iced mocha and I really didn't like it; it was quite watery and had a strange aftertaste. The pastries looked good though!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday before a boardgame hang-out. I definitely like the concept of the interior and that it wasn't occupied to full capacity. Lots of breathing room to enjoy the quiet ambiance.
The service is hospitable and friendly and I felt welcomed when I went in. I wanted to make the most out of my first time there so I got a Latte, a Matcha White Chocolate Cookie, and a Pistachio and Raspberry Roll Cake.

Out of the three items I tried, the Roll Cake had the most agreeable taste to it, particularly the pistachio tinged filling. I have not had a roll cake in ages but the cake itself had an almost egg bread like consistency, which is not how I remember the texture of a roll cake. 
The cookie tasted like a short bread cookie. I also have not tasted matcha in it's raw form so I have no idea what the flavor of it is. But I couldn't taste it at all in the cookie, even a subtle hint of it :-(
Ok, I definitely have to learn what a quality Latte and Cappuccino should taste like because it just tasted alright. But I do like the nice foam art on it which is what drew me to check out this cafe in the first place.

When I return I'm going to stick to the basics by getting a simple coffee and different cookie.
I've been looking up cafes in the downtown area that are somewhat centralized without them being overwhelmed with \"laptop loiterers\" that I see at Starbucks and other coffee places near the subway stops.
Given it's quiet and uncrowded ambiance, I really would like to consider this place as one of my coffee sipping sanctuaries whenever I am downtown.
And I hope to confirm just that on my next visit to Neo :-)"}
{"text":"quaint little cafe, and i mean little.  If you plan on coming here, make sure you scout a seat before you order.  Very hipster and not in a good way.

We ordered the matcha roll slice, and its pretty expensive for $6 a slice.  Thing is, they only make a limited number of slices everyday and they dont make more despite the popularity.  I give them points for a nice clean space and a good concept.

Thr service is where they lose big points.  Service.  I asked for a glass of water and was told to help myself.  There were two guys standing by that area who were enjoying coffee cause well, there werent any swats available.  When i waited for them to leave, i went to pour some water but the barista gave me a cold look and moved some cups from the area,  if you dont want people to serve themselves water, dont tell them to do it.

As for the other reviewer that said a barista has a resting bitch face, guess that applies to the female as well.  Service overall was cold and pretencious.  Now that ive been here, i wont be back."}
{"text":"I'd been stalking this place on Insta for a while now, and happened to be in the neighborhood today. The shop is super cute, lots of good seating and extra high ceilings. The Japanese hipster staff is adorable, and super friendly. The music is on point. But the coffee was lukewarm. I had an Americano, and the barista asked me to say when on the water, but then poured so fast it killed all the crema and didn't give me a chance to say when. I have no idea who would need that much water that quickly. So I was then SHOCKED when I sipped and found the coffee not nearly hot enough. It tasted ok, definitely some good beans in play. But just not hot enough. I had also been excited to try the roll cake, but in person it looked a little dry, not nearly as appealing as the roll cake at Petit Nuage - so I skipped it. Wouldn't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"I was thinking of giving four stars because of the minimal seating but decided that they still deserve five stars. I love the decor, ambience and most importantly the coffee and the desserts. We tried 3 roll cakes and they were all amazing. They use local Ontario fruits to make the roll cake. Their roll cakes are light and refreshing and not overly sweet. The fruits were so good too and definitely not soaked in sugar water like other places may do. Our drinks were also very good!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice , good place to study . But just for drinks ? Terrible . The drinks I got was not worth it for the price , I rather go to Starbucks . It's okay to go just for the experience of the cafe atmosphere . Also do not expect you to serve you your drink they tell you to get it yourself although you have to mandatorily pay a tip when paying by card . I don't understand this . The ice matcha latte taste like 1 dollar it is literally just iced milk with green colour and zero matcha flavour . It was priced  at 7 dollars but taste like 1 dollar , I do not recommend this drink . Come if your in the local area however do not come if you are purposely wanting to visit , it is not worth the trip ."}
{"text":"Great food, the cream buff melts in my mouth. Can't stop to have second bite. Had rolls too.

Shortcookie strawberry is one of my choice.
Definitely come back for more"}
{"text":"Really cool and sleek looking place. I just got their drip coffee and it was still pretty good. After looking at the Green Tea lattes, I immediately regretted not ordering it. Everyone is friendly and nice. There's a large window so you can watch them prepare all the delicious baked goods.

This place does not really seem like a place to get work done if you need outlets. Space is small and limited which is good for that, but there are hardly any outlets. Nonetheless, this is still a place I recommend checking out."}
{"text":"i ordered matcha hot tea and muffin. they are good. not too sweet muffin.  but one thing that bothered me is the customer service. the barista doesn't seem friendly to me and doesn't smile to me. I didn't do anything and being polite and waiting for the order. He prepared a coffee latte for me but I didn't order it.  it was a wrong order.  he asked me again kinda aggressive what did I order exactly then he gave me a werid look.

Space is nice and cozy and modern but limited space. I had to sit on awkward tall chair."}
{"text":"My local coffee bar.  It's clean and peaceful.
Great coffees and their cake rolls/pastries are simply divine and delicious.
No laptop weekends from 12-4pm.  What a great idea!

Owners and staff are courteous and engaging and I also love the minimalist design of this place."}
{"text":"Really great place to hang out on the weekday. On the weekend -- a little bit too many people. The lattes here are great. Their roll cakes are awesome as well -- definitely recommend the match and aduki rolls."}
{"text":"I've been to Neo a couple of times since it opened and it's quite a nice little coffee shop. I recognize the owners as I believe one is from Nadege and the other from Voodoo Child. The space is really nice - spacious, modern, light, extremely clean and chill. It has a slightly exposed, industrial vibe with lots of concrete and wood. I like combo of cute, tiny single tables up the front (something different) and booths and a communal table up the back.

They serve all your well known favourites - lattes, americanos, espresso, flat whites, cortados and pour over. They use De Mello Palheta beans which gives a strong and velvety coffee and non dairy milk offerings include almond, coconut and cashew (hipster on fleek right there). They also have a Japanese, matcha kinda thing going on with their baked goods, all of which look absolutely stunning (I guess I'd expect nothing less from a Nadege alum).

I think this would be a nice place to work during the day. They have free wi-fi and there were some people there with laptops so I'd assume there must be some outlets around. The staff are very friendly but definitely without haste. 

One barista impressed me with her recommendations of different non-dairy milks for different coffees based on their sweetness and frothiness. Based on signage they have won a few latte art awards. The latte art on my almond latte wasn't all that but it's harder to do. Only a few places around can pull of something exceptional with that material (Riddle Room, M Square, some people at Dineen).

Tip: To save you some awkwardness - the bathroom really is past the back wall and not downstairs like it would seem. The subtle sign they have doesn't really do the trick because the door almost completely blends in with the wall. But, evidently, if you push on it a discrete washroom appears as if from nowhere."}
{"text":"This place is pretty hipster imo. It's a modern cafe with a lot of Japanese influence. I personally like their roll cakes and croissants here. I had their matcha latte once and it was ok... all I could really taste was the milk as the matcha flavour wasn't that strong. It's a cute little cafe to go chill and do some work."}
{"text":"I've had a few flat whites here now. It's been consistently good! Staff has been friendly. No hipster personality. I prefer my plain croissants at Ezra's Pound, Thabor, or Manic Coffee. Raspberry coconut muffin crumbled a lot but it is healthier! Their cakes and profiteroles look great but I haven't tried it yet. 

I've been opting here over Rooster lately unless I need a 4 shot latte."}
{"text":"Delicious, well made coffee, nice food selection, courteous and friendly staff, interesting layout and decor."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the interiors here and their matcha green tea lattes are always impeccable."}
{"text":"Polite and friendly service. Delicious pour overs and baking. Spacious and comfortable."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite coffee bar in Toronto. It's serene and beautiful inside, the music is atmospheric, and is not too distracting for work or a conversation. The pastries are basically edible art, and every coffee I've tried has been really smooth and delicious. It's often a little bit of a wait for your order to be prepared, but it's worth it. The staff are great!"}
{"text":"I saw a really cool photo on Instagram of this place and the next day I was there.

It's got a really cool feel inside. The architecture is modern and the space is good for mini groups (booth-type areas in the back) or individual spots (in the front of the cafe). I like how there's many spots but there's still a lot of open space. 

I ordered a regular drip coffee ($2, Kenyan beans) and a ham and Brie sandwich ($6). The coffee was a little too citrus-y for my taste, but the small sandwich was very tasty. 

The service is very laid back. They have an open kitchen that displays the chef baking and making rolled cakes and such. 

3 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"The good: I love the decor of this coffee shop, very minimalistic. The lighting and the wooden decor gives it a very relaxing feeling. But of course it's always about the food and drinks right? Well these guys aren't too shabby with those as well. The drink that I recommend is the matcha latte. It was really good (tons of matcha flavour) and ;) their latte art design is amazing. This drink alone makes me want to come back.

The bad: I wasn't a big fan of the yuzu matcha soda (I think it was the most expensive drink in the menu). Their cookies, roll cakes, and sandwiches were OK. Didn't really impress me, but didn't disappoint too. The unfortunate part with the roll cake is that they ran out of the tiramisu one :( that's one I wanted to try. I tried the strawberry shortcake and the matcha with red bean - it's exactly how it sounds. The sandwiches I tried the smoked salmon and the chicken, both were fine too.

The ugly: although the design looks nice, the chairs can be quite uncomfortable, but that's just my opinion :)

Neutral: good place to study, hangout, or just solo sip on your coffee and go on with your day :)"}
{"text":"The clean industrial decor is really pleasant. They're particularly known for their Japanese log cakes which are delicious. It's great to see them working on it in the glass window. Overall you have a lot of choices when it comes to coffee.

I come here a few times a week and I usually get served by a barista (female) with short dark hair usually wearing dark/red lipstick. Unfortunately, she is only nice to regular customers and the last time I was in, she barely acknowledged me and then literally threw my change and my loyalty card on the counter at me. The time before that, she thought it would be funny to dance while pouring hot water into my drink and spilled it on the counter and on my shirt; her response was \"ooops..\" I'd like to say that these are my only bad experiences with the service here but it happens more frequently than I'd like. In the mornings on my way to work, I will walk by and if it's her at the cash, I walk over to Starbucks across the street because I'd rather start my morning of with a smile."}
{"text":"Really like this place! The baristas were very friendly helpful. Ordered a latte and matcha roll cake and sat for a while at a seat in the back. The interior is very clean and well-decorated, and the bathroom is kind of hidden as it camouflages with the wood wall. One barista came around with some water for the patrons, which was a nice touch!"}
{"text":"We ordered a matcha latte, mocha and a London fog cake roll.  The total comes to $18.++.  A little pricey~~

Food: 4 stars - the latte were great but ordinary for the price paid, the cake was great, not too sweet!
Service: 5 stars - the server was very helpful and polite!
Ambience: 4 stars"}
{"text":"I came here for the latte art, and I wasn't disappointed! I ordered a hot chocolate, and a smoked salmon sandwich, and they were both really good!

The hot chocolate was perfect, rich in flavour, and the smoked salmon had slightly tough bread, but they were very generous with the salmon, which I loved.

Also, the servers are very nice. It was my first time there, but they smiled a lot and were very polite. They also didn't mind my boyfriend's extreme fascination with their teaware ^^

I do feel as though they need more seats, or a larger seating area? We were lucky enough to snag a couple of seats, but the place could've definitely used more cozy places for customers to sit in and enjoy their food.

The minimalist design does look great, however. It's a nice calming place to sit and enjoy my hot chocolate. Can't wait to try the matcha latte next time!"}
{"text":"Best café in Toronto. Great coffee, service and beautiful space. And the pastries can't be missed. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"By far the best coffee in Toronto, other than Sam James. Not the mild rubbish found even in new hipster cafes, and surely a far cry from the utterly skippable TIm Hortons fare. The coffee has the right kind of strength, and their small bites and desserts are gorgeous. Beautiful designed post modern interiors too. Love, love, LOVE it."}
{"text":"Neo is THE best Cafe & dessert place in Toronto. I've never had a bad experience here. From walking in the front door, the staff has always been friendly & helpful. They don't rush you, and are willing to offer suggestions. 

My previous visit we had cinnamon lattes & a matcha roll cake. Both were delicious. The cafe was also packed with nowhere to sit. Luckily the bench & small tables at the front cleared fairly quickly. This is a great use of space for those of us who come to consume, not to use as an office.

This visit I got a matcha latte & the London fog roll cake. The matcha was perfect. It wasn't bitter or not mixed properly. The London fog roll cake was the perfect blend of slightly sweet & comforting taste of dark tea. 

Luckily Neo is close by & their hours are great. Love the design of this place as well. It's clean & very spacious. Even when busy there is often space to grab a seat."}
{"text":"I know this is a coffee bar, but that's not what was most memorable about my visits here.  (However, the lattes here are very smooth and definitely worth a try.)

The star at Neo Coffee Bar is the gluten-free orange dark chocolate cake.  It was one of the best chocolate cakes I've had despite being...*gasp*... gluten-free. Did I really just type that out loud?!  

Made with dark chocolate truffle, the cake has a whole lot of rich chocolate flavor without the usual heaviness.  Rather, the cake is a light sponge cake, infused with only a hint of orange.  

This place is so packed on Saturday afternoons that finding a seat is impossible, but I was able to come back on a weekday morning and enjoying the ambiance with my book and sleeping baby."}
{"text":"I had really, really high expectations for this place from the reviews... But I was sorely let down.

Long story short, this is a place that takes care of its regulars well... But treats new customers terribly, apparently. It was at the point where the credit card machine wasn't working, so I had to charge my own card, print my own receipt, and sign my own receipt and give myself a customer copy. It was not busy then either. The barista also forgot my order until I reminded her.

I'm sparing this place a one-star rating because it's decent, but even then - it's still expensive.

Definitely disappointing..."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Neo when I was walking home from the St Lawrence Market. It's tucked under a building near Federick St. First impressions is that the design of the space is really cool. It has a nice modern feel to it. The only thing I don't like is the seating. Seems like there aren't enough seats for the amount of people who come through this coffee shop. My friends and I had to wait and watch for people to leave. The washroom was also hidden behind the wall (the door blends in with the wall...didn't even realize there was a door there) as most people kept looking downstairs. 

They have a nice selection of desserts. I tried the matcha cookie. I personally love matcha so this cookie is so delicious. It has a lot of matcha in it and the white chocolate gives it a nice touch. My friends ordered the shingen (soy bean) and matcha roll cakes. Matcha was okay, nothing to rave about (coming from the matcha enthusiast). The shingen was delicious and I would recommend it if you order a roll cake. I would like to try London Fog roll cake next time since I'm a fan of earl grey tea. 

The drinks are good. I've had the espresso before and I think their espresso is top notch. The aroma of the espresso is sweet and has a great taste. I usually like their vanilla latte. Their latte art is also super good. I do enjoy seeing the art I'll get when I go there. I had a matcha latte yesterday and it was good. It wasn't anything I can rave about, it was good but it's not the best I've ever had. 

Neo will definitely be a staple for my weekend coffee and dessert cravings."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times since my last visit. 

I realized that one of the barista just have a resting bitch face lol so he looks angry all the time. Otherwise the roll cakes are still good, but texture is still too wet for me. 

Their Kyoto Matcha latte is excellent, strong matcha flavor and not too sweet!"}
{"text":"Lured by their delicious looking \"roll cake\", I finally visited this new venue. Masashi the patissier used to work at Manic coffee on College and Bathurst. He is the one who was making their heavenly gelato in summer time. I was a big fan of his organic true flavored gelato. So now he is making all the baked goods here at Neo coffee bar. I've gotta try them, right? I ordered a raspberry pistachio roll cake and Heavenly Cream tea by SLOANE. Good choice of tea. I also enjoyed the roll cake. Unlike Swiss roll cakes in other Asian cafes or stores, their roll cakes have lots of cream inside (which I love the way it's made). I want to describe more details of its flavor and stuff, but to be honest, I couldn't give myself enough time to examine it because it was so good and airy. It is rather dangerous because it's gone in the blink of an eye if you don't focus while eating it. I definitely have to go back to write a better review and I will do it!! Next time, I may order their matcha roll cake or perhaps both raspberry and matcha... Oh they also told me that they have peach roll cakes for a seasonal choice and Rose&berry roll cakes as well. Awwww tough choices.
You need to go to this place early enough otherwise you don't get many choices like I didn't. They are gone fast.
Their ginger molasses cookies are also gooood. If you are a ginger lover, you are gonna love it!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice welcome back home to Toronto from nyc. I'm glad toronto has such a great coffee shop. Great latte and very nice place. 

Theres great seating infront. Big long bench with student sized desks as individual tables. Nice communal table at the back. Concrete floors Very modern, but very rustic at the same time. Feels more like brooklyn than toronto."}
{"text":"I Gave 4 stars because they have the BEST tasting matcha tea latte, very high quality matcha tea powder, makes for an excellent drink!! Worth the 6-7 dollars even, with tax. My opinion on the other offerings is quite low, the green tea roll cake i had was mediocre at best...very light and airy, didn't taste like i ate anything! I think they are overpriced, too. Also, the regular espresso lattes are mediocre, i've had much better tasting espresso at Sam James coffee shop, located near Front and King"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Pretty nice cafe. The most unique drinks I ordered are probably the Kyoto matcha latte and the crimson iced tea. 

Kyoto matcha latte ($5.95) - simple green tea latte. Smooth with no grainy taste. Presentation is nice. The lattes come with latte art on them. 

Crimson ice tea ($3.25)- just iced tea, isn't sweet. Tastes similar to cranberry juice with no sugar. Less sour than cranberry juice. 

Matcha adzuki roll cake ($5.5) - matcha cake with organic red bean filling. The cake is soft and moist. Flavour is good. 

Shingen roll cake ($5.5) - soybean cream filling with organic red bean and rice cake. Didn't like this one too much. The filling tastes similar to peanut butter. The mochi was soft yet chewy. The cake was moist and soft though. 

Simple, clean looking cafe. There's plenty of seats. There's booth seats at the back. Good place to do some work on your laptop. The place is quite. 

There's a parking lot near by the it's more expensive than parking alone the streets. Parking lot is ($3.50) per HALF AND HOUR. Road side parking is ($2.25) per AN HOUR. It's cheaper to park alone the streets."}
{"text":"Definitely the best coffee shop in Toronto. For matcha lattes especially, but also the cakes. Even the restroom is gorgeous. Its only flaw is being incredibly far from my work/apartment."}
{"text":"Love this place. Stopped by here once while in the area now I crave it every so often despite it being quite out of the way for me. Beautiful space, great (!!) pastries, and very carefully made espresso drinks."}
{"text":"Be honest, my first experience with Neo was just so so. The  service was cold, the matcha Adzuki cake roll was dry and had not much matcha flavour, Shingen cake roll had a strange burned taste... so it turned me off to return. 

But wait,... I was meeting a friend in St Lawrence Market and decided to give Neo another try.  This time, the Ontario Strawberry roll was very fresh and tasty, the Orange Dark Chocolate roll wss made with very rich dark choco and match very well with orange. Both rolls were moist. The matcha latte was fine as well and wish it would be smoother in texture. Service was friendly and quick.

Then, I went back to try the Pistachio and Raspberry roll; the pistachio cream was very rich in flavour and went so well with the raspberry. It was my favourite among all the flavours I have tried. The roll was moist as well.

I would go back for their tasty roll cake."}
{"text":"It's expensive but a great treat every once in a while. 

First of all, the coffee bar itself is really nice. Very trendy, clean, and \"aesthetic appearance\". 

I always enjoy the cakes - I have tried the raspberry-pistachio, chocolate-orange, and black sesame. 

My go to drink is the kyoto matcha latte which is delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome coffee. Friendly staff. Vegan options. Beautiful interior. Def worth a visit if you're in Toronto. Near George brown university and the water front. 

Wish they had more vegan options, but def grateful to get vegan snacks 7/8 am while visiting."}
{"text":"3.5 to 4 star rating... Overall, lots of great thought goes into their carefully crafted drinks.  All espresso shots are smooth but their final flavour profile might be not exactly what you're expecting (strong star anise licorice flavour chai or very minimal vanilla flavour in the vanilla latte)

What a great little cafe tucked just east of the central area.  Its gorgeous with its zen like atmosphere and lots of light filtering in.  The drinks are a perfect match to this great atmosphere as they're finely crafted with much care.

We arrived mid afternoon and the serene cafe had many nice seats to enjoy your cup and treat.  There was 3 people behind the bar and were very helpful explaining the different types of drinks and recommending what the person would like.  Seeing how it was the afternoon, we didnt need a huge caffeine hit and we noticed they had a lot of interesting different drinks not based on espresso.  We ended up getting a chai latte since they said it was not a premix.  I also love the fact they offered real matcha and alternative milks.  

Our chai latte was really full of flavour... star anise played a stronger role in this one compared to others.  It was such an interesting mix.  It probably not my absolute favourite in Toronto but I love the richness and full bodied spice flavours being played out.  It really was very well executed.  

As we were waiting for our drinks, we saw a bigger group ask about the various cakes they had available.  They weren't offering slices but the person behind the counter was willing to offer half the cake roll and they had so many wonderous flavours.  We did see the matcha and strawberry one as well.  They looked so good.  

We'll definitely be back and try more of their espresso based drinks."}
{"text":"Interesting, spartan decor; espresso was very \"loud\" and fruity/citrusy, not for the feint of heart... Jasmine Iced tea was delightfully easy-drinking and not at all sweetened; just a hint of the ingredients."}
{"text":"NEO COFFEE BAR

What I LOVE about this café... 
1. Service... SO GOOD
2. Food... baked and made fresh everyday 
3. Cleanliness... Very clean!
For me to find this hidden gem is blessed! 
I love how the cakes are made; not to sweet, yet not to thick. To be honest, I had the muffin as well, but it's not as good as the cakes. 
CAKES ARE DA BOMB!!! 
They have the cake of the month and that's called \"neo opera cake\", that cake is soooooo good... but hard to cut since the chocolate on the top is super hard. 
Totally recommend to anyone who wants a nice little cafe!!!!!
The only downside to Neo cafe is the space is so condensed, it's hard to find a good seat to do work and etc. 
What I absolutely love about it is that the service is great! They'll recommend items for you if it's your first time coming. Also the cakes are not too sweet, so it's a perfect taste for those people who don't want anything too heavy."}
{"text":"Great place to work or hang out with friends, but it gets quite busy though. They have very comfortable booth seating with free wi-fi connection. 

I tried their green tea and muffin. Both delicious. The staff was nice to top off my tea with more hot water. 

The only downside is that it's a little expensive here but it's a great place to pop by once in a while!"}
{"text":"Neo coffee Bar might now be my favourite cafe in the area for coffee and treats.

Kyoto Matcha Latte was rich and one of the prettiest latte art I have seen. V60 Pour over was nice and mellow, much better than what I made at home. 

And not to be miss is the Roll Cake made of Ontario organic wholewheat pastry flour and organic free-range egg!! Matcha and Aduki, my 2 favourite components was delicious! Highly recommend if you are into Asian sweets!  

The vibe here is modern and laid back. 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"all the roll cake flavours are worth a try, though I want to mention the sesame one specifically! Also love the matcha latte: where most matcha latte are overly sweet and artificial, I really enjoy Neo's matcha latte. Interior decorations are also relaxing with spacious seating."}
{"text":"Neo's interior is lovely and clean. Came here on two occasions, and my feeling of discontent is mainly based on their service. 

While I did enjoyed the matcha roll cake (fluffy texture, good amount of cream and wasn't overly sweet) and latte, their service however leaves much to be desired. On both occasions, one barista had no energy and had a permanent scowl on her face, while the other barista was so pretentious on the second visit. Sorry, I wasn't aware that I was in a high-class salon. Why bother to work in a customer-service industry if you can't be nice (or fake being nice) to patrons who may not be regulars?"}
{"text":"Neo Coffee Bar is a spacious, modern cafe near old town Toronto. The decor is filled with industrial materials, concrete and wood. 

Soft, fluffy cake with yummy creamy filling; Neo's roll cake are delicious. Most of their pastries are made from whole wheat pastry flour, organic free-range eggs, organic milk and organic cane sugar. Everything is made from ingredients sourced from local purveyors. There seems to a wide range of healthy, gluten-free and vegan options. 

My companion and I shared the infamous Matcha and Aduki roll cake. The cake is made with Kyoto matcha and organic red beans. We devoured it within seconds. 

Great drinks, delicious treats, fabulous atmosphere - this little tucked away cafe is one of the best places to work out of!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a speciality coffee place and a wonderful desert this place deserves the detour. This is a very nice discovery for me. Very friendly staff, you can see them work on making their one pastries trough the glass wall and the coffee is perfect! 
I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I have passed by this place many times and saw an article in the Bento magazine about it. I gave it a try today. I  had a look at everything and  I got the gluten free orange chocolate cake  slice. The slice tasted  very good with  a perfect blend of orange and chocolate flavors and the cake was very moist and soft.  The service was good and helpful.  I  will be returning again to try different beverages and foods and will bring friends along as well. 
Here is what is on my list for the future:
Kyoto Matcha Latte
Matcha & Aduki 
Shingen 
Matcha White Chocolate
+ their seasonal rolls  
Matcha White Chocolate Cookies

I also plan to do a pairing of the Matcha Latte and Matcha Cookie"}
{"text":"The only place I've ever received a latte art swan out \"in the wild\". My matcha tea latte was delicious. I'm looking forward to trying their treats next visit. The decor was modern, clean-cut and I thought it was so cool to have a 'viewing pane' to watch their cake rolls being made."}
{"text":"This coffee bar is nicely tucked away on Frederick Street just across a more prominent Starbucks. The prices were definietly higher than Starbucks but the quality is somewhat lacking. 

We ordered a matcha green tea latte and a black tea. They didn't even offer milk or sugar for the black tea that was being drank inside the shop. Clearly there is something not on par with the service compared to the atmosphere. The matcha green tea was close to $7 and our total came to around $10. In spite of the poor drink selection, we ordered the roll cake as well. The roll cake tasted very funny, the flavours did not mesh well at all. I would not recommend it to anyone. 

Overall the best feature of this place is the decor but the sitting was limited and it was very hard to study."}
