{"text":"I love this restaurant! Today was my first time checking it out as I'm new to the neighborhood and I was very pleasantly surprised. The gentleman behind the counter was so kind and friendly with every customer. I ordered the chicken roti and it was delicious! One of the best roti I've ever eaten with a nice amount of spice for kick and lots of chicken too not just potatoes. I can't wait to go back and try other dishes. Even my daughter, who is a picky eater, thought the roti was yummy. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I paid extra for the \"bone out\" roti and it had bones in it anyway. Nearly choked on it. Owner doesn't smile at me."}
{"text":"Service is sow but good is great. I had th chicken roti - it was pretty juicy and the right level of spice for me. They only accept cash."}
{"text":"No boneless jerk as previously reviewed. Drove there and was all the way home when I realized. I do believe that they have had boneless jerk in the past . Witnessed a friend who bought a few months back. Called and spoke to someone on phone who denied that this was ever on menu. Food was ok. Not that spicy for jerk. Hot sauce has no kick. And way too much rice. Be ur own judge."}
{"text":"I have loved this place when I have a craving for rotis.  I would rate it even higher but the bone in roti is tricky to eat.  I do not like bones!  I realize this is common in a lot of roti but I would prefer no bones.  So, enjoy it but chew carefully know that you will have to remove a few bones.  I have found the staff to be all business but they have warmed up to me so that we have lovely conversations while I wait for my order.  I have tried different rotis there and enjoyed all of them."}
{"text":"Good Roti and the soup is amazing. They've just installed a debit machine so it's not cash-only any more."}
