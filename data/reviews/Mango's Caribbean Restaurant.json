{"text":"Let's start with this. The food is great. Everything we ate was cooked to perfection-albeit stingy portions for the price. Not to say that it's easy but their style is all pretty much pre made. Nicely roasted chicken, rice, etc. So it should be pretty easy to keep it all smooth right? Well not in the slightest apparently. We were quickly seated, handed menus and offered drinks. Fifteen minutes later the bartender noticed nobody had brought them to us so he did himself. And took our order after noticing nobody had done so. Food came out and that was the last we heard from anyone there. I stopped a waitress and asked for a second drink. Never got it. Our plates sat empty for a good half hour as staff busily wandered with nothing in hand. We had to beg to get a check and then beg even more to pay it. I hope they get it together. The food was really good. But it won't last long if they don't."}
{"text":"Hands down fave restaurant in town! Staff is great, food is spectacular & prices very reasonable. Try it!!  We loved the yucca fries and jerk chicken wings. Fries, tostones & plantains are delicious!!"}
{"text":"Cheers to outstanding service, good food, and great prices! 

Coming from Charleston we dont get to have too much of a Carribean option when it comes to going out to eat. 
Traveling from near and far we found Noda to be the perfect spot to hang out hopping bar to shop Mangos appeared to be the most comfortable sit and eat! 
The waitress was patient and personable, and we were even approached by the what i believed to be the co-owner of the restaurant. He was also quite kind, personable, professional, and hospitable! 


Great spot to have delicious home styled meal."}
{"text":"We've been there twice now and both experiences have been fantastic! Both times I've gotten the roasted chicken and the chicken has been flavorful and tender and perfectly cooked. The roasted pork entree is phenomenal! The black beans are tasty, as well as the rice and beans, plantains and yuca. 
Highly recommend a stop in here!"}
{"text":"Nice small spot in NoDa. 

The food was  good. Prices were fair. We found the portion sizes to be on the small/average size. 
My food came out in a reasonable time. 

My biggest issue was we purchased a Groupon for this restaurant and they refused to honor it (even though the Groupon is still available online). After we paid, they printed and posted a sign saying they will not honor any Groupons or restaurant.com vouchers. Personally this is bad customer service."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I had the curry goat, and there was a young woman tickling the ivories which set a nice ambience."}
{"text":"Met some friends here to try out the latest opening in Noda, I must say all four of us and thoroughly enjoyed everything we had...empanadas, ceviche, curry chicken, tacos etc. all we're good, I definitely recommend this place.."}
{"text":"I tried Mangos on a quick visit to the Charlotte area. First things first, the food and service were both excellent! The group I was with tried the jerk chicken, the curry chicken and the chicken empanadas with side dishes rice,  beans and fried plantains. All very generous portions and very flavorful. They may have a small menu, but it includes traditional Caribbean fare and choices for most tastes.  They also have a good cocktail and beer selection. The setting is relaxed with a couple of TVs and some reggae-style music playing. Check it out if you're in the NoDa area!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! This is our second time back and we had the salt fish fritters and jerk chicken empanadas as an appetizer both times. The red snapper with the brown stew is great! My husband loved the jerk wings. Our waitress Tracy provided great service both times. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Love the jerk tacos, it was really juicy and tender! Definitely try the ox tail entree...not really into those things but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"The server brought us some complimentary hibiscus ginger tea which was amazing. Their wings were falling right off the bone and the flavor was unreal. We also had fried yuca and veggie curry paratha which tasted really really fresh. Everything was fresh, flavorful and authentic. Service was good although there weren't any other customers so we had their undivided attention. The only negative feedback I have is that the yuca and plantain apps were a little dry."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at mangos it was delicious this is real Caribbean food The drinks were amazing appetizers were delightful and the entrées were delicious this is my new spot"}
{"text":"Good first experience 4 months ago. Something has changed. Very empty for a Friday night, waiter unattentive, no silverware, sides were stale, waste of money- felt uneasy-will not be back. Something off and only 2 reggae songs."}
{"text":"Really really good food! I had a fish and chips chef special that was amazing!!! My girlfriend got the tacos that were amazing as well. The restaurant wasn't that busy when we ate there so we got to sit in the window and people watch. Toward the end of our visit the chef brought us some chicken croquettes that were outstanding. The have a limited menu, but I can't imagine anything being bad after the experience we had."}
{"text":"Mango's may be one of my new favorite spots. I am quite particular about places that wave the banner of \"Caribbean\" or any other ethnic cuisine. While Mango's is not quite a place that I would give 5 stars (yet), it certainly has some elements that I quite enjoy. 

Atmosphere/Service
Located in NoDa, Mangos provides a great vibe if you enjoy Caribbean food and good cocktails. They have a great street side location and patio. I wish the patio was in the front of the building, but structural I assume it is not possible. The general dining space provides adequate seating, beautiful murals and a small bar.

The service is quick and friendly. Joe, the bartender is great. Be forewarned, he makes a mean mango Mojito, which pairs very well with the roti. 

Food
The ceviche was quite good. It was the perfect pair of fresh, citrus and heat. Garnished with pickled mango, it's one of my faves. The curry chicken roti (buss-up-shut) was so good that the other person with decided to change their order. The buss up is made in house, per the chef who also blessed me with tamarind sauce. 

The drinks are excellent. My fave is the mango Mojito! 

So far, Mango's has moved into my \"Faves\" bookmark collection...which doesn't come easy."}
{"text":"First time to Mangos and I'm thinking \"what the heck were you waiting for?\" I had the chips and salsa to start out and they have a great seasoning on them paired with an interesting salsa with a dollop of yogurt on top. For my main course I had the curried goat. Perfect amount of spice, a little heat and great flavors; a perfect dish. For sides I had rice and beans and vegetables which were cooked perfectly. Warm, but still with some crunch. Two Red Stripes finished out an incredible meal. Get to Mangos, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"We made a second visit. I was very happy (I just want you to WIN!!) because the food is very GOOD! I had the jerk chicken entree, with a side of rice and beans and plantains which I don't believe were fresh, more of the frozen type. (I could be wrong) but were still good. My food was not hot at all. I was so hungry that I didn't bother sending it back. I will say, my companions weren't wowed at all! Service was slow and we waited quite a long time for chips and salsa and even longer for our drinks, which came after the food. There's no such thing as food to-go here either. I left still hungry :(

Something to keep in mind: you have VERY strong competition within close proximity. You can get superb quality, fresh, HOT and nicely portioned meals all day within feet of this restaurant. Rice is fairly inexpensive and I myself, am completely puzzled by the amount that is served, especially if it counts as a side. I also heard another table mentioning that the drinks were subpar compared to another establishment. Please read your reviews and make what adjustments you can. The place was full and lively so that's a good thing. You are such a welcomed addition to this area. I will continue supporting hoping to see further improvements as you grow."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited this place on a Friday. We were early before the crowd so we were able to sit near window. My food was good, waitress was nice and prices are reasonable. I didn't have an alcoholic beverage but I attend to visit again to try a few. Parking in area is limited to street and YMCA parking. If you're in the NoDa area, stop in you want 've disappointed."}
{"text":"Great experience at Mango's. We visited on a busy Saturday night but had a great experience thanks to the excellent customer service from Adrian, an amazing manager who apparently doubles as a waiter and bartender and anything else that is required to make customers happy. Have been to many places during peak hours and very few can handle the pressure like Adrian while keeling a smile on their face."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service needs work. The servers were fine, it's the food coming out of the kitchen and the bartenders that are super slow. My two friends ordered drinks and it took forever for them to come to b the table. We got our food before they got their drinks and they ordered those first. I'm also not quite sure if the cooks and chef are paying attention to the orders. My friend ordered curry chicken with green beans and peas and rice. My other friend ordered jerk chicken with green beans and yellow rice. When the plates came, they had mixed vegetables Instead of the green beans. Now the server came out and told my friend they were out of rice and peas but she never came and said they were out of green beans until our plates were on the table. What if someone was allergic to the mixed veggies that the chef put on the plate instead of asking for a substitute. I ordered 2 chicken empanadas, plantains and yellow rice. The empanadas were great. I had a snafu, one of my chicken empanadas was actually vegetable so I sent it back and they corrected it. The plantains were good and the yellow rice didn't have any flavor. It needed seasoning. I added the mixed veggies to it and it made the rice 10x better. The french fries are good. Theyre cooked in garlic. Overall, the food is great but the service is slow so beware."}
{"text":"My son and I visited Mango's yesterday and was blown away by the awesome food.  We had the Hit Me mango drinks, prepared by the awesome bartender Adrean--fantastic!!!  We were escorted to our table by Tracey who so friendly, warm and made us feel right at home.  

We had the shrimp ceviche, jerk chicken wings and chicken empanadas.  My tastebuds came alive! The ceviche was the best I've ever had and the spicy sauce for the wings was just fabulous!!!  I was so speechless about the food I had to meet the chef, Antonio and give him a kiss.  One of the best food experiences I've had in a long time.

The atmosphere was colorful with an island feel and the music was perfect.  Finally, had a chance to meet the owner, Roy and tell him about the wonderful experience I had.

If you haven't tried this place, you've got to go.  Everything about it is just phenomenal!!!  Great work everyone.....I'll be back.

Best Regards,

Ray Clark"}
{"text":"This place was FABULOUS!  My son treated me and my daughter there for Valentine's day and I was in heaven.  The food was great, they had a pianist playing great music (of course, my funny valentine was one of the selections).  The food was perfect.  I had the curry chicken, rice and beans and roasted vegetables and it was so good, I could've had a second helping.  My son had the jerk chicken, rice and beans, and fries.  He loved it.  The fries weren't just ordinary fries.  It tasted as if it had some garlic Parmesan added (but didn't confirm that).  The atmosphere was relaxing and inviting.  Almost like I could've laid near a fire place with a book and enjoyed the meal.  The host was so warm. He gave me and my daughter a rose (which made her night).  I will visit this place over and over again.  It's right in the heart of Noda, so I would definitely make it a stable."}
{"text":"Anxiously waited almost 2 years for this spot to open and it didn't disappoint! 1st - atmosphere - welcome to the Caribbean mon! Music, colors, even the eliminated menu reminded me of spots I've visited in the Caribbean. It was very clean also. 
2nd - service, very polite, friendly, informative (tall blonde waited on us, I think her name was Tracey? She was great. 
3rd- drinks - so in my opinion this is going to be a great summer menu, I tried something called beat the heat I think - perfect for August weather on Theo back porch (which I took a peak at while there). Good selection, mostly rum drinks (that's to be expected but they had a full bar.
4th - Food - so just FYI the smell met us on the sidewalk and pulled us in. They have traditional Caribbean food - jerk chicken and pork, beans and rice, plantains, again expected - they also did a jerk chicken nacho. We got the empanadas (3 types) all were delicious! We also got the jerk wings - ended up ordering two orders - fall off the bone GOODNESS!! 
I will def be going back. Someone already posted a pic of the menu on yelp so I won't repost as it's not available on their website."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Caribbean restaurant. The takeout order of oxtails and jerk shrimp was extraordinary. Great quality food with proper execution can cause an emotional reaction...I got emotional. Lol! I can't wait until my first dine in experience."}
{"text":"I'll revisit. However, I will not order the jerk pork. It was not what I expected. I received pork chops cooked in what tasted like pure gravy master; not a drop of jerk seasoning. When I make and order jerk pork it is cut cubed and cooked w jerk seasoning. I think a non-West Indian patron would enjoy. I will try something different next time."}
{"text":"Stumbled on Mango's by accident.  We were going to Haberdish, which is right next door. There was a significant wait, and their bar was full, so we added our names to the            
list and decided to go to one of the other bars to wait it out. Mango's  was the first place we passed. Went in and was pleasantly surprised by the menu. My husband is from Trinidad, so to stumble upon a Caribbean restaurant, with such amazing cuisine, was a true find. We loved the Baba Ganoush. My husband had the chicken curry and loved it. I had curried chickpea and veggies, which worked beautifully with my Vegan diet. Service was spot on. We were seated immediately. Love NODA,and this restaurant fits well with the entire scene."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our trip to Mango's this past Sunday! The space was well decorated and there was a lively atmosphere, despite it not being very busy following a big Panthers loss. 

Our group was promptly seated and offered menus. We selected drinks, including red and white Sangria on special ($5) and cocktails (~$10). The drinks were good, but a little on the sweet side. We also got chips and salsa, and the chips were fresh and crisp and served in a cute cigar box. 

We then ordered entrees including jerk chicken tacos, jerk chicken nachos, chicken empanadas and curry goat. The main reason for the non-five star review was the fact that the food came out at all different times. 

The food itself was very flavorful, with the a little bit of heat. Portion sizes were decent for the price, though not large enough for leftovers (I wish! The goat had great flavor and was tender). The only issue was there were quite a bit of bone pieces mixed in with the meat. 

The best part of the meal was the service! Our waitress was extremely friendly and accommodating, despite the challenges some of our party threw her way.  We'd definitely be going back soon. Hope word spreads about this place!"}
{"text":"We visited Mango's for the first time on Valentine's Day.  We walked in a little before 7 pm and were seated immediately.  (Just as an fyi - by the time we left around 8:30, the restaurant was nearly full.)

Our server greeted us and went over the special for the evening (salmon and scallops - yum!!) and let us know that Wednesdays are half-price bottles of wine.  (I already knew this, as it was a major factor in our decision to try them out.)  Their wine bottles max out around $38 - so, you're really getting a deal here.  We ordered the malbec - and liked it so much we got a 2nd bottle later in the evening.

We started with the shrimp ceviche - served in a margarita glass and chips in a cigar box.  The presentation was great, and the flavor was even better - sweet and spicy.  I ordered the salmon/scallops special and my husband got the whole red snapper pan-seared.  The food far exceeded expectations - it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. 

The owner stopped by our table to introduce himself and made sure to catch us on our way out to thank us for dining with them.  We enjoyed ourselves in every way - I'm excited to go back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to try Classic Curry Goat! I absolutely love their decor, ambience! Their service was quick and most hospitable people. Perfect place for experiencing Caribbean cuisine! :D"}
{"text":"I have visited this place twice this week! Omg! I've never been a fan of Caribbean food but this place has changed my mind. On my first visit I had the curry chicken, green beans and fried plantains. On my second visit, I shared a whole red snapper, black beans and fried plantains. On both visits I had the amazing Tracy as my waitress. You know, good service can make a good restaurant Great! She was pleasant, knowledgeable able to make recommendations! Now back to the food! Everything was seasoned just right. The spice level was just what I asked for. I will be heading back there this summer."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, nice bartenders & food was fresh. Jerk chicken came with rice & peas and sweet plantains. The skin was super flavorful but I did expect a more juicer, saucier jerk chicken. This was more rotisserie like. 

Customer service was good and menu had potential so I'd come visit again to explore the food."}
{"text":"Mangos is a new restaurant in the NoDa area. I came here with 2 of my friends, who are all vegan. It's difficult to find vegan friendly restaurants, ESPECIALLY after 10 p.m. Authentic, traditional food. With great music I might add. Vegan food, authentic crowd, great music, can you ask for more?"}
{"text":"the service here was terrible and they didnt prepare my salad like i asked. my friends and i waited thirty minutes to get our order taken and it was an all around sub par experience. the food and atmosphere were good, but the service wasn't good at all. the woman who sat us down forgot about us and i honestly wouldnt go here again"}
{"text":"We stopped in for an impromptu dinner out for Valentine's Day/Birthday and it was just great. They had a special deal with salmon and scallops, and I couldn't have been more delighted. They, and hubby, made us/me feel very special for my Val Birthday, with roses and specialty drinks and great food and service."}
{"text":"Food is so amazing I can't believe there's not an hour wait on a Saturday night, but we were seated immediately. The pork kabobs, whole yellow tail snapper and jerk chicken were all so tender and flavorful we decided this is our new go to place to on the weekends.
Full bar also with a good selection of bourbons and scotch and the prices are really reasonable."}
{"text":"We came to Mango's on a double date. Our friends raved about it so we were excited to try it.

I'm not sure if it was an off night, but the waitress was not on her A game. She asked for our IDs (which was totally fine). I showed her my ID and she looked at me like I had 3 heads - she had totally forgotten that she had asked to see the IDs. Then she couldn't remember details about the menu. 

My husband and I shared the half roasted chicken with rice and beans and plantains. We shared because our friends said it was plenty to share, I beg to differ. I thought the portions were pretty small for this type of fare. But, the prices were very fair. 

The restaurant was very crowded on a Saturday night so they must be doing something right. I believe in second chances so we'll have to try it again, hopefully it was just an off night."}
{"text":"I just had the Classic Curry Goat and it was so good! The sides were great too, the green beans were fresh roasted and the tostones were crispy and delicious. This place is a great funky addition to restaurant options in NoDa, the space has a funky island vibe and we're currently jammin' to some soul music. Oh and they have a great selection of local craft brews, yay!"}
{"text":"Mango's is still in their soft opening phase, so I'll cut them some slack. 

Food: I order the chicken and pork tacos. Both were great and decent portion sizes. The chicken tacos had a nice kick to them. We also order the chorizo empanadas and my SO ordered the Classic Chicken with yellow rice, peas, and sweet plantains. The waitress asked him what two sides he wanted so the meal is a TON of food. However, when the plate came out, there were no rice peas or plantains. I asked about this, and the waitress only brought out the plantains. Perhaps there is some confusion if the dish actually comes with two sides or not? 

Service was mediocre. We had to ask for waters three times. Also, we got the empanadas after we got our meals even though that was the first thing we ordered.

I'll go back, but I'll give them a couple weeks to sort out the kinks."}
{"text":"What a pleasant and enjoyable experience!
Not only was the food delicious, the wonderfu folks who work here are so friendly and kind! When you depart a restaurant and receive hugs from the team, it makes quite amemorable experience. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hit me drink is great and strong. $11 but totally worth it while waiting for dinner reservations."}
{"text":"I'm Jamaican & Guyanese so I know good curry, but because of my ethnic background I have been reluctant to try many Caribbean restaurants in the Charlotte area as they tend to leave me depressed and disappointed. Luckily my fellow Yelper's reviews convinced me to get out my comfort zone and boy am I happy I did! The curry is almost as good as my Jamaican born mother's. The buss up shut (Paratha Roti) was so delicious, I ordered more! The plantains were cooked to perfect, soft (but not mushy) and sweet. I have already sent messages to my West Indian friends letting them know Mango's is worth a try and of course I've volunteered to join them :) Check them out you won't be disappointed! BTW: don't go to a Caribbean restaurant and order jerk chicken tacos...we don't eat jerk chicken in tacos!! It's not authentic to our culture or our food. If you're a newbie, start with the curry chicken, rice & peas, and plantains."}
{"text":"If you haven't checked out the newest spot in NODA, you're missing out!  Unique and exotic flavors make you feel like you're on vacation .  The fried plantains and curry are a must try!"}
{"text":"Today me & hubby had no plans just getting to know our new home here in #charlottenc . One of favorite neighborhoods is #noda where people are friendly and the food is fantastic. There are many gems here in #noda which is an  artsy neighborhood filled with great little shops and even better places to eat. Today we found a new jem @mangoscarribeanrestaurant that has made this  #puertorican #woman believe that Latin & Jamaican can be magnificent together. The drinks are Soo good.The food is not only good it's fantastic with just the right spices. As a #nyrican I never believe people can makes tostones right but they mastered it and with home garlic sauce that's out this world . it made this #synic a believer a brand new regular customer. BRAVO MANGOS BIEN ECHO (WELL DONE)  #foodie #food #yummy #charlotte #northcarolina #amazing #letseat"}
{"text":"Finally, after being in charlotte for months and trying 6 Caribbean spots we have found our place away from home. Now it started off rough when the waitress drenched us in four cold glasses of water, but when the food came out all was forgiven. We ordered the Yellow Tail Snapper with peas and rice and Oxtails. As, I mentioned earlier we have tried different spots around Charlotte and all have disappointed especially with the Oxtails. We found that they were always sweet and that's unheard of in our world. MANGOS Oxtails had the perfect spice and the flavor was undescribingbut we fell in love. 

The management team were wonderful and took care of us and that's the type of establishment I love supporting. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Everything is so good and has much flavor! All the sauces are made in house! My drink came in a coconut. Such a good time! The chef comes out with every course and is so friendly! A great addition to NoDa!"}
{"text":"Our second visit and it was great.  Service was spot on (Ingrid is fantastic) and the food was delicious.  The menu description does not do it justice.  My wife had the bread with the curry chicken and I had wings and the jerk chicken tacos.    All were fantastic.   Wings were falling off the bone and had a great spice.    We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for a networking event. I thought the food would have been more authentic. Even though, the waitress said the owner was Jamaican. I like the set up of the restaurant. It is in a nice spot in Noda. I  just had the tropical hush puppies. They were good. I recommend this place if you are in the area and want Caribbean food."}
{"text":"I ordered brown stewed fish. I should've known something was wrong because it was cooked in less than 15 minutes. Brown stewed fish takes longer. My dinner had 2 pan seared fillet pieces with no stew gravy. I expected the whole fish with the head since it cost $20. I was too hungry to complain. The rice was mushy and the vegetables was scorched so badly that the broccoli was black. Whoever fixed my plate threw peppers on top to mask it. The rice and fish was well seasoned but I didnt eat blackened vegetables. This is not what I expected especially since the Yelp ratings are decent. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I am giving 3 stars because my food has been consistently good every time I have gone here, BUT the service....  Every time something has gone wrong with our order, we didn't get part of what we ordered, food took awhile and it took forever to get drink refills, etc.  So sad- I was so excited for this place."}
{"text":"I just stopped in one evening for a drink and it was an A-Ok experience!  The bartender was very friendly, greeted us right away, went over the menu.  The restaurant was basically empty when I came in.  It was a weeknight, early in the week, and a little late also.  

I had a mango mojito, and while it was really delicious, the price was not appealing.  I'm not sure if they have drink specials or happy hour throughout the week, but they definitely need to.  Very pricey!

They brought out some chips and a salsa mix, which was amazingly delicious.  The chips were fresh and hot.  I may come back to try food soon."}
{"text":"The service as Mangos was terrible. We were excited to try the new place in the neighborhood but wait over an hour and never got our food! We did have chips and salsa which was mediocre but not worth the price. I wish I could review the food but like I said, after an hour we never got it!"}
{"text":"It's a no from me. My friend came into town and had heard good things about Mangos. So we went mid day on a Saturday. I had the Island chicken with green beans and French fries. I read somewhere that the fries were cooking in a garlic oil. They were not. There was a tiny smidge of a garlic and herb sauce that was on the fries (See photo). The beans were decent. The chicken was cut up in random pieces, dry, and bland. Fries were basic without sauce. Green beans were good. There's a mustard sauce for the chicken. It wasn't good.

My friend had curry goat, rice, and green beans. She thought her goat was a little chewy, but had decent flavor. Their cocktails were good.

Things went left with the tacos. First, the taco appetizer was $11.25. It came with three tacos and I couldn't help but think how I could go to Cabo Fish Taco and get an entire meal for the same price. The pictures on Yelp showed 3 tacos. The waitress said there would be 3 tacos. They come out and there are 2 tacos. Of course I point out the obvious and she says that it's the kitchen's choice. ????!??!?! So I asked to speak to management. He comes out and says that there are two because he was delivered larger tortillas and so there's more on each taco. The pictures looked the same size as on Yelp and the waitress just said there would be three. If there was a change of plans for today, she should have known. I told him I felt like we were being jipped. He finally conceded (almost as if it's not worth arguing) and sent out a 3rd taco. He wasn't rude about it, but didn't seem to understand that consistency and managing expectations in a restaurant is a big deal. The tacos were okay. Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Wow. This place was absolutely amazing. We weren't expecting much because in comparison to the other restaurants it was pretty empty. We had the scallop ceviche for an appetizer and it was delicious. I had the island chicken with yuca and fried plantains and my date had the jerk shrimp with yuca and black beans. We both were raving about how good the food was. The service was great too. If you are in the area, definitely check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here on Tuesday and planning to go back there this weekend. The food was excellent! I had the ox tails & hubby had the jerk chicken. I liked his sides better, plantains & yuka. I had black beans & roasted veggies. The roasted veggies were good, but the beans were just ok. The decor is fabulous, makes you feel like are in a place by the beach in the Caribbean. And there is a beautiful baby grand there and the friend of the owner playing was phenomenal! Hope she is there again tonight!"}
{"text":"This was my first time with my hubby and 2 year old. Kid friendly! Great music!The food/drinks were good and everyone was so nice. Our server could have been more engaging by paying a little closer to details but she was nice. My tip: the restaurant entrance is on the side and it is confusing. A simple sign \"use side door\" by your open windows will do! We couldn't at first figure out how to get in and no was helping at first and with so many other restaurants we could have just gone elsewhere. Thanks! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Yeah Mangos is alright. Dope location in Noda but the ambiance was pretty cool and the food was good as well. The chef came out to asked us how the food was and we learned he was Puerto Rican. I will definitely be back soon for the ox tails. Jerk chicken was tops"}
{"text":"This is a really cute restaurant, but the service wasn't that great! My cousin and I arrived at 7pm on a Saturday night, and the restaurant was practically empty. We ordered two drinks, and it took about 15 mins to come out, and my vodka on the lack of rocks was so watered down, I guessed that it was just sitting that is why I barely had any ice. I ordered the shrimp curry with rice and black beans (I wanted cabbage, but the waitress said they didn't have any ) the shrimp curry was very good, but again it seem like it had been sitting because it was not very hot! Maybe, I just didn't have a very good waitress because the food was rather tasty (even though they didn't have cabbage,) so I will try this place one more time in the future, and hopefully I will have a different experience.  To be continued..."}
{"text":"The flavors were wonderful! We had jerk pork and quarter chicken - both spectacular. They came with beans and rice and plantains, but there are lots of side options.  The gentleman who appeared to be in charge saw we had a little wait to get drinks so he gave us complimentary chips and salsa. They've got local Charlotte brews on tap for the right price and a fun, bright spot right in the heart of NoDa. The jams kept us groovin, and we had a great time. A super addition to the neighborhood, I wish them the best!"}
{"text":"Upon arrival there was no silver on the table and had to wait till after we got our food to get them. There was 0 check in from our waitress. She was quite forgetful and got the food order wrong. The curry goat is too spicy and the curry chicken isn't \"traditional\" curry. It is more of a \"rub\" than anything. It isn't worth $18 for a \"main\" course at all. I'll stick to MaMas off central avenue for traditional Caribbean/Jamaican food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I made a reservation for 18 for my fiancé's birthday at 7:30, but we didn't get there until 7:50 and they still kept our reservation for us. We also had more than 18 come and they accommodated for the extra people.  Already going above and beyond. Once we were all seated we ordered cocktails and beers. Our waitresses were very diligent and never messed up our orders. The cocktails are absolutely delicious and well worth the price. I ordered the mango rum punch and tried my sister in-law's gorilla milk which were both very tasty. Then the food orders were made. My fiancé and I split the ceviche with shrimp, the pork nachos, and the goat curry with rice and beans and green beans. Each food order we made we were blown away by the amazing flavors and spices. I tried bits and pieces of everyone's food and with 18+ people you know most of the menu was selected and everyone was super impressed. It was also DJ night and he brought a lot of fun to the restaurant. He even turned the music down when we sang happy birthday and post blowing out the candles played \"in da club\" by 50 cent. With such a large party I was expecting less than impeccable service, but that is not what happened. It was the best. Thank you to the awesome staff and owner for making my fiancé feel like he had the best birthday ever!!! Everyone should come try this place and get a cocktail, some nachos and enjoy the ambiance. You can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Never a bad meal and possibly the best ceviche I have had domestically. Jerk is spicy and delicious. Sides are good. The shrimp ceviche was fantastic and on par with Quincho's in Antigua. 

Pass on the pork skewers


Nachos,  wow. When was the last time you ate nachos?!?  Awesome

Only one minor consistency issue - One time the ceviche had the shrimp left with the tail on. A small faux pas, but delicious nonetheless."}
