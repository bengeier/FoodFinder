{"text":"This is probably one of the best small restaurant wings place in Calgary. The honey garlic wings is to die for and at an affordable price. They also have pizza and fries and donairs which taste awesome as well! I highly recommend this place if you're driving home and don't want to cook lunch/dinner!"}
{"text":"GREAT DEALS this place hands down has some great savings on there pizza and wings I visit Calgary from Florida frequently and this place had the best bang for your buck 3.99 for 2 slices and a soda 39.99 for 3 Medium pizza wings soda fries and more like that alone should convince you to stop by on top of prices the food is great wings are crisp and a good size not those tiny wings with barley any chicken some places try to get away with calling a chicken wing pizza is great I'm a huge crust guy which usually makes or breaks a pizza place for me and it was delicious French fries were great you should definitely try it out small business humble owners hidden gem in Calgary"}
{"text":"I am from out of town. Wanted something quick and easy to take back to my hotel. Ordered a carry out special. 1 medium 3 topping pizza, 16 wings, garlic bread, and 3 sodas for just over $20?? Cant beat the value.  Pizza was fantastic. Wings were pretty good. A bit small but you can't really complain for the price."}
