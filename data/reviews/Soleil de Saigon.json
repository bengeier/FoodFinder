{"text":"Definitely a better alternative than Vie&Nam if you are work downtown and is craving for a pho. Of course, their pho is not comparable to the one in Chinatown but would satisfy your craving. I would particularly recommend the Bun Bo Hue which is my favourite dish there. They also have desserts and side dishes. Spring rolls are very authentic (they add taro in it !) - must try."}
{"text":"Omg, this place is the bomb. If you're working near PVM and like Vietnamese food, you got yourself a new restaurant to go during lunch time! They do Viet subs and all kinds of soups to which I got addicted. They have 3-4 different vegetarian soups, all with a wonderful broth that do not taste chemical (my favourite is the spicy curry - note for meat eaters: they have a wide variety of meat soups as well!). Soups are around 10$, Viet sub around 5$. The restaurant has a few seats but is mainly there to take the food to go. The people running the place are always smiling and kind. As long as they'll make these flavourful soups, you'll continue to see me!"}
{"text":"Discreetly placed in the middle of a tunnel between Eaton Center and PVM, this little Vietnamese joint is a nice place to get some pho or sandwiches. I went with their chicken bahn mi and it was alright. My only complaint was the pricing being higher than it needed to be and the sandwich missing some sauce. It was a little dry.  It's perfectly suited for a quick lunch for take-out as the sandwiches are prepped ahead of time so you just go in, tell them what you want and you pay. In and out within 3 minutes."}
{"text":"j'y vais régulièrement. enfin une belle option rapide dans le quartier. très très très économique et frais. excellent service en plus."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best Bahn Mi in the city. This review is based upon the sandwich experience, I haven't tried much else here yet, but the soup was very good too. It always drove me nuts that a city stocked with the two main requirements for Bahn Mi - fresh french bread and great asian stores - couldn't ever properly put the two together. Or at least I haven't been able to find one yet. So this one definitely was legit. Warm bread, traditional fillings and balanced flavour.  I dig the low key location too, and the staff (I believe family run) were great and really nice people."}
