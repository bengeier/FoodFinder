{"text":"In my never ending search in Airdrie for my new favorite Vientamese restaurant, unfortunately this isn't it. 

The good, the restaurant was clean and the server was polite. But these things are just base line in my mind for any business. 

The meh, I can't remember the vermicelli bowl so I obviously was not impressed. 

For today I will continue to pine for my favorite bun thit nuong that I can't have any time I want anymore."}
{"text":"I wasted my precious lunch on this sub.
I was craving a vietnamese sub so I decided to try this place again after having a good sub there a couple years ago. I don't get the cravings and enough motivation to go to chinatown very often. 
Today's sub was the absolute worse sub I have ever had. 
The bread was stale and moist, nowhere near toasty like a vietnamese sub should be. No crunch at all.
I specifically asked for no chili peppers but they were added anyways.
There was very little meat in the sub and it barely had a flavour.

It was a very sad sandwich."}
{"text":"What I love about Thai Tai is that it's fast, and consistent. The prices are decent, it's open late, and it has wonton soup. My absolute favorite thing to eat there is the shrimp wor wonton. Its Loaded with with vegetables, has a good amount of wontons,could do with a few more shrimp and chicken in it, but still delicious and simple. The stores are always clean and the staff, I find a bit Istandoff-ish, but courteous. A good backup for dinner on a lazy day."}
{"text":"I had the worst rice bowl I've had in any sorts of Asian restaurants. I had prawn, chicken and beef rice bowl and it was the shittest ever. 2 pieces of cucumber and little shred of carrot was all veggie I got. Other places I've been, I had really good amount of veggies and meat. The prawns I had here were teeny tiny and meat was dry. My friend and I were VERY disappointed and my friend who suggested to go here even apologized to me. Maybe their sandwiches are okay but rice bowls were total waste of money."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Thai tai! Great for after the bar eats or if you have a quick craving that needs to be satisfied! I love and recommend the fresh fruit bubble teas!"}
{"text":"Came here with 7 friends, no reservation, busy but manage  get a table.
Service slow but ok, may be  because busy.  Food not my cup of tea, been to many Thai restaurant, this is not the Thai food I expected.  Don.t think I will be back."}
{"text":"On Par. This Thai Tai is pretty much like all the other Thai Tai's in town... the only difference is that when you come here on a late night on the weekend, you have to navigate your way through all the loud and drunk people on the sidewalk.

I live a little closer to this location than the more well known Thai Tai so I thought that I should give it a try. Although there's nothing wrong with this location's food, I prefer going to the one closer to 4th st.

I usually order the watermelon bbt and it was perfect!

Thanks Thai Tai!"}
{"text":"I had a Viet sub here. It was your typical sub. Prices are good. There are a lot of options on the menu. Bubble tea is good as well."}
{"text":"This is a good bet for some reliable, flavorful, quality, take-out. There are a few spots for eat-in, but it is small and limited for space. My daughter likes the Spring rolls, I like the chicken noodle soup or the shrimp wor wonton soup. They do nice Vietnamese subs, the sate tofu is my favourite. The salad rolls are good. They have yummy pearl drinks -  I suggest choosing a fresh fruit option. They have a steady flow of customers. There are a few tight parking spots in their wee parking lot. It is not the best, but it is good, reliable and convenient, fairly priced fast food."}
{"text":"I've often gotten my order wrong at various restaurants but at least they've all tried to make my experience better by either fixing the order, discounting the order or even making it free. 

But that at Thai Thai. At Thai Thai, when you tell them you got the wrong order, they try to convince you that you in fact did order what you received and that since you ate some of it before realizing you got the wrong order it's \"too late\" to change. Didn't offer to discount the order or bring a side of rice, simply walked away.

I had ordered their special \"extreme Thai bowl\" on rice (as offered on the menu - see attached picture) and received it on vermicelli. The waitress whom barely spoke English kept telling me that it only came with vermicelli and even brought back the menu to show me, until I showed her that it indeed offered with rice. 

The person I was with ordered a sub - the sub was alright but the bread was stale. He had also ordered the shrimp woe won ton which was good but ruined with sweet soy sauce that was on the table which wasn't indicated it was sweet. 

Generally not a good experience, won't be returning any time soon, there's many other Vietnamese restaurants that are far better than there."}
{"text":"It's a Vietnamese fast-food outlet.  Period.  I had the Ultimate Spicy Chicken & Beef Sate. I got exactly what was promised, which was fine.  

In life's grande scheme, we ought to content ourselves with these little pleasures, however mundane or mediocre.  Don't live your life with regrets."}
{"text":"Skip the soy sauce they give you - it adds way too much salt for you to taste anything else after.

That said, we were skeptical at first cause we went around 6 pm and saw no one there. Uh oh. But because we needed to rid ourselves of Canadian cash before heading back to the states and in the spirit of adventure decided to try a new place, we stayed here. We're glad we did.

I got a charbroiled pork sandwich and it was whoppingly packed with flavor - whether there is better banh mi in Calgary I don't know, but what I do know is that sandwich was dang good. My wife got the lemongrass chicken - milder flavors, so if that's your thing you can opt for that, but its hard not to say no to the pork."}
{"text":"I enjoy Thai Tai, but not this location. I live by the one on 17th and work by this one, so I feel qualified to regale you...

The food at this location is different than the others. Its cheaper (not less expensive!). The bubble tea is sub-par, fruit choices are rarely fresh but powdered or masked by milk/sugar. The soups seem to always be half empty and the service is slow. 

The reason I am giving them two stars is because they still make fast(ish) affordable food, but if you're already in Chinatown, there are way better options for soup, subs and bubble tea within a block or two."}
{"text":"The pork sandwich is amazing and has forever changed the way I look at food. For me this sandwich was eye opening to the fact that pork in a sandwich is amazing. I love every bite of this sandwich and it fills you up. Perfect if you're hungry and need a quick bite eat."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that this location opened! I love their subs! I have ordered out at the one on 6 ST and 17 AVE SW many times over the past few years but have always been dismayed at the lack of seating. This location has a few tables and chairs. Watching the creatures on 17 Ave can be somewhat entertaining while munching on a warm satay beef sub. The food is always fresh tasting and filling. Very happy to have a location closer to my house."}
{"text":"I love Thai Tai. They make some delicious Vietnamese subs. I usually order the ultimate sub which contains both chicken and beef with all the toppings. The bubble tea is the bomb as well and the food pricing is decent. Great place to go for lunch."}
{"text":"Ironically enough, this Chinatown store nicer and cleaner than the DT one, much more modern with a fresh menu display.

Ordered the iced coffee, a bit too much condensed milk.

Lots of parking on side streets.

credit cards ok.

across from Saigon Y2K."}
{"text":"I don't like the food here at the best of times but went in today just for salad rolls. Terrible.    Lettuce, two shrimp and that is it.  I took them up to the counter and asked where the cilantro and carrot were.  This one doesn't come with that, I asked what one does.  None.  The picture indicates differently.  Sorry, doesn't come with it.  The dipping sauce was like water with no taste, none, threw it all away.  Will never be back."}
{"text":"I've been in twice, both times I had a different variation of their beef pho.

The broth was bland/ boring, even the sate option completely lacked flavor.

I can't say much else about it. It was a step up from hot water & noodle soup. 

I also tried the fresh chicken spring roll. It was ok (also boring) and made awkwardly large which made it messy to eat.

Nothing negative about my experience- clean venue, friendly staff- but also nothing worth repeating. Below average on taste."}
{"text":"I used to try to be a fan of this Thai Tai and then I just gave up. Nestled in Chinatown, it's an ideal spot to grab something to eat when nothing else is open. I know some people that really enjoy the subs here. However, I am not a fan. 

Thai Tai has a tofu sub available, but the sauce used is not vegetarian friendly so I have always had to be mindful to ask without. I just don't find it that good and would rather go to Kim Anh on 17th if in need of a veggie sub. I also find the service lackluster and slow, and the environment awkward to sit down and enjoy myself in. If it's busy, it's obnoxious, and if it's quiet, it's deeeeead. When they are open, there are much better options in Chinatown to eat. 

Also, the bubble tea is totally that powdered bullshit. I would walk myself right down to Try Again bubble tea across the street instead if I had a craving. EW.

{"text":"This is quite possibly the worst Thai Tai in the city.  I've never been here before but I decided to stop in for a quick satay beef sub, what a mistake that was.  The first indication was a large beetle scurrying on the floor as soon as I walked in.  I decided to forget it; partly from hunger and partly because it was Chinatown.

I ordered my sub and the guy just turns on the toaster.  There were only three other people in the restaurant and so he turned off the toaster to save energy.  Because of this though the bread was too soft and not toasted at all.

The meat was quite different from the other Thai Tai locations. The satay beef was bland and above all else, cold.  Shortly after I felt sick to my stomach and had a bout with an unmentionable condition that made me visit the restroom every hour or so (you get the idea).  I cannot say for certain it came from this place but the timeline fits in my opinion.

Never again."}
{"text":"I love Thai Tai's brown bread Vietnamese subs - get the Sate Beef with all the toppings and extra Thai chillies.  So healthy and so tasty.  This is the location in Chinatown, located in City Plaza.  

Their Sate Chicken Noodle soup is not too bad.  Soup's got a little kick."}
