{"text":"Eggs unfortunately had too much salt and pepper. I don't recall salt and pepper on the list of ingredients on the menu and all of us did not like them. My croissant was over cooked and service very slow. 

No refill offered on my ice tea. Perhaps it explains why it was so empty. Sadly we won't return.,

A shame. We always look for new places to eat . This won't be on our short list."}
{"text":"Had the chef crepe with ham, Brie and enjoyed it.  My girlfriend had the salmon sandwich and liked it.  The ambiance is nice .  Nice pictures on the wall.  Good service."}
{"text":"Really great experience. Food and cappuccino were amazing. Croquet madam, taboule, and tomato soup were superb! Service was great as well. Will be back!"}
{"text":"So delicious!
Just had lunch there with my husband. We both had the lunch combo - best French Onion Soup I've ever had. 
He had the turkey panini and I had the Chef panini and we both really enjoyed it.
A little tucked away, but I like it that way. Will definitely be back for the crepes!
The owner was a sweetheart too."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! 1st time here. Great serve with a light and bright atmosphere. I had the Chef Crepe and loved it."}
{"text":"Cafe Paris has, easily, one of thee best French toasts I've ever had.  Their omelets are exceptional.  I frequently bering friends here for breakfast and they all love it.  The couple that run it have thrown their hearts into making great handmade food.  It is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"The Chef Panini is the best sandwich I've had in a long time. Thick slices of great ham, brie, tomato, caramelized onions, and homemade pesto on toothsome Wildflower Ciabatta bread.  The French Taboule (Couscous salad) side was a nice change and also very good. Can't believe I've never noticed them at the south end of the Design Center all these years. Looking forward to trying one of their BYO dinners, and sampling more from this wonderful French couple."}
{"text":"We come to Cafe Paris every time we come to the Scottsdale area.  We love the breakfast, especially the French Toast a l'Orange.  It's delicate and custardy like a bread pudding.  Croissants are good and we like the quiche.  The owners are warm and friendly.  Mondays are discount days when everything is discounted (30% discount at this point).  It's definitely worth finding this little Bistro."}
{"text":"Food! Service! Atmosphere! 
This is a hidden gem of a place and worth a visit for those tired of the regular recycle of local American food. 

The atmosphere is cozy and homely, it feels like stopping by a cherished relative's place for a home cooked meal. There is nothing flashy here and if you are used to valet service, there are other restaurants north of here. 

The menu is mostly sandwich type items, but there is a good selection from ham and goat cheese, to salmon and cream cheese creations worth a taste. Deserts here are a delight, and nothing feels over priced. 

Unfortunately, the staff is limited so on busy days you may have to wait a little longer for service but I have never had a bad experience and always felt welcomed. I'll be coming back to try more items on the menu for sure. Bon App√©tit!"}
{"text":"I had excellent and delicious crepes with jam with just right scrambled eggs and bacon.  Service was fast , warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Great little gem!  Food was wonderful - had the turkey panini and tabouleh.  My friend had half of a panini and French onion soup. Service was good and it wasn't really busy when we arrived but it filled up quickly."}
{"text":"Friendly staff that carefully creates each dish... If your picky about eggs you will appreciate the attention to detail. Great value!"}
{"text":"Excellent service for our large party. Crepes were amazing and the poached eggs expertly cooked!"}
{"text":"Love their French onion soup and Italian salad. Good service too. Quick for lunch so you can get in and out if need be."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a little breakfast as I wait for my husband to have surgery nearby. Awesome crepes! I had my crepe with eggs, caramelized onions and Swiss cheese.  So yummy!  Arnaud, the owner, is a wonderful host, a native of Paris, and really a great chef!  

Ambiance is unique - gorgeous morning to sit outside, and thankfully they have a little table at the front of the restaurant.   It overlooks the parking lot, but at least it is in the shade. (You can see the planes taking off at Scottsdale Air Park.). The restaurant is a part of the Scottsdale Design Center, so the inside opens to the common area of the design center.  

Reasonable prices, great crepes, and wonderful host/chef.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"You just have to come visit!! Delicious and I love it. 2 years strong and the owners are so sweet!"}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic French food owned and run by the sweetest couple.  Love it!  Try the French onion soup..best ever."}
{"text":"Incredible onion soup and butter croissants! I don't know about you but that's enough to get me in the door.  This is a tiny restaurant with plastic tablecloths in a strip mall in an industrial park - and it is nearly perfect!

We always see families speaking French to the wife that works the front of the house and I understand why, there may be slight adjustments for the American palate/ingredients but I've eaten at this type of place a dozen times in France.  Service is as fast as they can do it so head to the nearest drive thru if you are in a rush.  

Croque Monsieur is outrageous, chef panini is excellent, goat cheese panini is excellent, quiche is delicious, the French taboule is delicate, the fries are as good as you'd expect at a French Bistro and I've already mentioned the soup and croissants.  

A wonderful little place, the exact type of small business we should be supporting."}
{"text":"I had the Turkey Panini & Garden salad. Great place & like the nice atmosphere. Will definitely try it again"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Crepes are wonderful and the goat cheese basil omelet was out of this world!  Owner is french and makes the entire experience out of this world!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service! Friendly proprietors, varied menu, homey Parisian decor.  Cookies! Great coffee!"}
{"text":"Croissant and coffee good if unspectacular. Problem is owner, superficially at least, is typical haughty Frenchman. Business partner ordered an iced coffee, owner brought one out with milk mixed in. Lactose intolerant partner requested black, owner acted like he had just been shot- totally ungracious. Brought back black iced coffee and snootily asked \" do you want a straw\"? Life is too short to deal with d-bags, plenty of other choices in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We love Cafe Paris and have been coming here for years. The owners are very nice and provide great personal service.  I get the French sandwich on the baguette almost every time since it reminds me of my trips to France. It is a simple classic sandwich. Recommend the skinny fries too. Also love the quiche Lorraine!  Yum!  Even though we moved to Sedona, we still eat here when we visit Scottsdale. Definitely recommend for a nice breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely MAGNIFICENT! From the delicious cappuccino to the divine crepes with jam (comes with scrambled eggs and bacon). I can't wait to try lunch"}
{"text":"Nice breakfast! I had a mushroom mozzarella omelet. Wife had the quiche. Coffee excellent!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my husband for lunch on a weekday.  We had the tomato and French onion soup, both of which was so good!  They didn't taste canned like a few other places we've been to.. We also had the crepe bastille and goat cheese panini.  The crepe was made crispy (almost reminded me of the crepe a la cart in Breckinridge).  The panini was crispy warm and chewy -- exactly what we were looking for!!  We can't wait to go back and try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I chose to give one star because this restaurant failed in all aspects.  Service was mediocre at best.  The chicken pesto panini was over toasted, the chicken was bland, tomatoes not close to ripe and zero pesto flavor. The tomato soup was over heated, no body and no flavor. Epic Fail.

Food Guy Out!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad that this place is not closer to our house.  Owner was very pleasant, food was delightful.  Portions were plenty.  Crepes are made fresh.  Do not leave without trying the crepes!"}
{"text":"We visited for brunch. Excellent again. Crepes ilian ... Salmon, dill, cream cheese in a perfect balance. Great coffee...the roasted potatoes were hot...freshly made...not precooked and left on the corner of the grill to be heated later."}
{"text":"This is such a fun little restaurant.  The food is great and frequently made in-house.  When I worked closer, I went here frequently.  I miss it!"}
{"text":"We just went here for brunch and it was quaint and adorable! The ratatouille  panini with pesto was excellent!"}
{"text":"It's great to have a high quality neighborhood place like this in the area.  I had the goat cheese and basil omelette and a crispy on the outside, soft and buttery on the inside croissant.  Brilliant."}
{"text":"Absolutely unreal food. The Effiel tower sandwich was perfect. This is also saying something considering I almost never would enjoy eating a sandwich. It has some of the most authentic and best French food I have eaten since being in France. I highly recommend trying this place out, even though it might not look like much from the outside. On top of this the owner is the sweetest French lady and the atmosphere is extremely homey. Great prices."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Owned by a family originally from France--the father is an incredible chef.  I love the basil and goat cheese omelette--sounds boring, but is lovely.My daughter loves the ham and cheese omelette. Can't go wrong with any of the crepes!!! I have a hard time choosing between the yummy toasted baguette and the homemade croissants. Lattes and coffee are high quality. 

For lunch, don't miss the onion soup, any of the crepes. Yum! Frankly, why have a sandwich when you're in an authentic french cafe?! Clearly some things on the menu are better than others; thus these have become my staples. The d√©cor is marginal, but all worth authentic French food."}
{"text":"Customer service was impeccable. Food was delicious. Even my picky 10 year old son enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Authentic Parisian cuisine... The Croissants and crapes were perfect and unlike anything else you can find in Arizona! The coffee and service also gets a big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"It was good. I had a 1/2 panini and a side of fruit, definitely enough for a light lunch. The location was a little difficult to find so it took me a couple of extra turns. Definitely better than most corporate sandwich shops! If you are in the area it is a good option, that said, I would recommend driving across town to check it out."}
{"text":"We were in the area and found this wonderful cafe on Yelp!  The owner/chef is from Paris. He can cook.  I had the quiche it was the best I have ever had.  The favors just exploded in your mouth. My husband had the crepes with ham, cheese, and scrambled eggs.   Wonderful. We will be back for lunch!!!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast in the valley. I am a sucker for the French culture. I don't care for crepes and croissants, but I am a sucker for a great cappuccino and eggs. And when there is a toasted French baguette option, I'm all in. This place is a hidden gem and wouldn't have found it if I wasn't waiting at the stereo system place across the way. 
Fast, friendly, tasty. Bonjour!"}
{"text":"One of the best paninis I ever had! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"In town and one of our first outings is this restaurant.  After an absence of two years the quality, Taste and presentation was even better than before.  This is a restaurant you use to gauge other eateries.  So glad it was still here."}
{"text":"What a great discovery - right in our backyard, so to speak. A French couple have a small bistro that offers French fare - and European portions.   Wonderful cappuccino; freshly baked pastries; lovely omelets - this PA farm boy has found heaven in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I am vegetarian and I loved their goat cheese panini. Service was great and wait time was minimal. I also love the decor. Filled with paintings from local artists and beautiful forest green wall."}
{"text":"J'adore ce petit caf√©!

I've come to Cafe Paris a multitude of times now, and I've come to the realization that it's hard to say no to this place. The space in comfy, the service is friendly, the prices are nominal, and the food is always great.

My favorite thing on their menu is their French onion soup! It's delicious, and definitely some of the best I've had in the valley. You won't find a brown water recipe here...they make it from scratch! It's served with a clear broth that's loaded with soft onions. Traditionally topped with toasted bread and melted cheese, it's a winner in the flavor department.. And by the way, I've ordered it roughly a dozen times by now, and it has always been consistently scrumptious!

Other great menu items (in no particular order) include any panini, the Eiffel Tower, croque-madame, and butter cookies. The paninis all come with a tasty pesto sauce that should please any pesto fan, while the Eiffel Tower is one ginormous club sandwich that will satiate the biggest of appetites. As for the croque-madame, just imagine one of the best grilled cheeses ever, stuffed with ham, and topped with an egg; it's awesome.

I make it a point to go to Cafe Paris several times a month because I know I can get a good meal for fairly cheap. That said, keeping this place all to myself sounds wonderful, but it's time to let the cat out of the bag on this somewhat hidden gem. 

Bon App√©tit!"}
{"text":"What an excellent find! We discovered this little gem while looking for an inexpensive restaurant in North Scottsdale. My wife had the Caribbean salad which was perfectly fresh and flavorful. My daughters had French baguettes which were as close to ones I've had in France. I had the chef sandwich with their fresh homemade dressing! Also the crepes were outstanding! Great value."}
{"text":"The food makes up for divey feel of this place. We looked up french food and this was the suggestion from yelp that was closets to our location.

The inside has a kind of strange decor and the tables could use a little help but the menu selections made up for it. The owner has a french accent and you can tell she takes pride in her restaurant.

I ordered the croque Madame and my husband ordered one of the crepes. It wasn't a traditional croque madame but it was absolutely delicious. Definitely worth the money and I would get it again in a heartbeat. So if you want a little taste of french food for a good price, check this place out."}
{"text":"Chef crepe was amazing, apple tart was great too.  My wife loved her croque Madame.  So happy we found this place"}
{"text":"This is a charming place with good food. Finally French food that everyone can come in casual and enjoy fair price great customer service not pretentious like other French restaurants it the way it should be"}
{"text":"You must have the French onion soup! It's simply amazing. What a fabulous place, tucked away and simple however incredible food!"}
{"text":"Great discovery. My romantic husband knowing how I long to visit Paris found this cafe to take me for Valentines Day. We went for breakfast. Delightful atmosphere, loved the artwork and decor. My husband chose the almond croissant, different than expected but delicious. I loved my cafe latte and I chose a crepe special, had just the right amount of jam inside 2 light crepes, also included scrambled eggs, so fluffy and perfectly seasoned with pepper, and 2 pieces of delicious bacon. The owner is very friendly and welcoming. Prices are very reasonable. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Buyer beware... 

My first taste of the water --dreadful.  I asked if the water was filtered and I was told by the waitress that it was.  Was charged for bottled water when I said the water tasted bad. They should check the filter.  Probably hasn't been changed in forever. 

The French onion soup was handed a crossed the table to me rather than brought to my side and was almost dumped on my lap.  Scared me was to death. Minus one star. 

The waitstaff's appearance was slovenly at best.

The further disappointment was the soup which was thin, pale, no flavor--except for excessive black pepper--which I could smell before tasting it--onions not cooked properly. My friend and I both thought it the worst French onion soup we had ever eaten. And we are both older than dirt. 

I mentioned this to the owner and I was still charged full price for the soup.  And offered no replacement. Minus one star. 

The coffee was drinkable. Plus one star. 

The salad that came with my Cr√™pe was soaked in vinegar and not enough oil. The reverse ratio making it unpalatable.  Minus one star. 

The Cr√™pe was cooked on one side and completely white and doughy on the other. My friends cr√™pe was exactly the same way.  Most on appetizing!

Both Cr√™pe had an extremely dried out edges like crispy crackers. My companion and I were trying to decide whether it had been frozen and thawed more than once. 

We were both positive it was not made fresh that day. The sauce was thick and pasty and lacking in flavor.  It's sad in a small clump on top of my cr√™pe which made it very unappealing. Minus one star. 

The chicken wasn't too bad. Plus one star. 

The mushrooms tasted old and were rubbery. 
Minus one star.

Out of all of the food I ordered the soup and salad and the cr√™pe, I only was able to eat the chicken amongst all the other items.  Rather costly few bites. 

The owner saw that I had barely touched my food when she picked up the dish, the second dish that was not enjoyed, and not a word was said. Minus one star. 

Be sure to dress in layers. When we came in it was relatively cool. Which was fine. But during the hour that we sat there it got progressively warm to the point of being what I would call Uncomfortably hot. Minus one star. 

I have been to a few French restaurants around the country and this is probably my very worst experience.  The owners attitude was a negative embellishment to the entire scenario.  I had asked her whether she was interested in feedback before I offered it. Her response to my description of the soup was to argue. 

The very best experience of my life was the New French caf√© in Minneapolis, Minnesota, owned by a Scandinavian couple, many decades ago. 

My friend expressed the thought that she would never be going back here again --she would be calling all of her friends to tell them how disappointed we are in this restaurant and to recommend that they don't go there."}
{"text":"Nice little French cafe hidden in a shopping center. I had the Crepes Brittany, my wife had the Crepes Bastille, both were delicious! Prices are affordable, especially for how good the food is. My only complaint is that the coffee is pretty bad. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Don't walk.  Run!  Having a chat with the friendly Parisian chef / owner, I learned this French restaurant is about to be featured on Check Please, Arizona!  When it is, people will go just because they're curious.  Once they've tried the food, they'll be back over and over again for the food.  Either way, you'll never find a seat!

It's situated in a nondescript building where you pass a gas station parking lot to access it.  Once inside, the decor is pleasant enough with hints of Paris, though nothing (that I could tell) authentically from France.  I expected at least the china would have a French flare, though it was a simple white.

Rest assured, the insipidness ends there.  Peruse the breakfast / lunch menu and you'll find all the expected staples such as fresh baked croissant, French onion soup, quiche and more.  The chicken sandwich on a baguette was more than adequate in portion size and taste.  I'm not normally fond of thick crusted breads, but this one really wow-ed me, even more so than another well-known baker in town.  The pieces of juicy chicken breast were amply sliced, the tomatoes were juicy and the thick cut of Swiss cheese was A-MA-ZING!

That said, the shining star of the meal was dessert - the Berry Crepe.  I have no idea what type of flour is in the kitchen, but whatever it is, I hope they never run out.  Save for Paris, I've had crepes in plenty of restaurants before, not one of them came close to that of Cafe Paris.  Light, yet full flavored, by far the best I've had, right down to the sweet berry filling oozing from each forkful.

Is Cafe Paris out of the way for you?  Well, it is for me, too, but I now consider this a destination place well worth the trip.  Next stop: savory crepes, here I come!"}
{"text":"Gaaaaaah!!!! A real French bistro simply amazing the dessert was out of this world I got the crepes with the vanilla ice cream and raspberry dessert sauce oh my God I nearly passed out it was so good used to go to zinc bistro not anymore I will only go here from now on totally authentic!!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from Atlanta and found this hidden treasure a few miles from our resort. I  had a lovely breakfast of Crepes and eggs and my wife the  omelette with croissant.  One of our favorite things to do when traveling is to eat  local...never chain restaurants. This place did not disappoint. Quiet...friendly...and excellent food. You must go."}
{"text":"Had the vegetable crepes. Extremely tasty and enough food to satisfy. The fries are unreal. Don't usually eat fries but couldn't stop eating theirs. Pleasant service and very good coffee."}
{"text":"Fantastic Crepes! Also wonderful coffee - if you're in the area this is definitely a great place to try!"}
{"text":"A fellow foodie (my son-in-law) and I had been talking about this place for more than a year or so. 
He had lunched there a couple of times and had been wowed by the French husband and wife team who own and run the place. 
I am not a big fan of the traditional heavy-sauced, small portions of French Cuisine. I am more for the progressive French chefs who combine traditional non-negotiables with more contemporary practices. 
Punch Line:
The food here is not bad. It's above average. But honestly other than the mile long list of crepes not much is truly cuisine francaise here. 
I ordered the tuna sandwich: extremely high score on quantity; average on quality. 
The chicken panini (panini in a French Place, go figure) was also big in size but average in taste. 
So: As long as you don't expect traditional French Cooking, this is a good place for lunch."}
{"text":"I was skeptical since virtually every French restaurant I go to in America falls short. when I walked in my skepticism grew...it's not a fancy joint. However, this little caf√© delivered. The chef is French...go figure. The French onion soup may very well be the best I've had in the United States. And the crepes were fantastic. Unlike American restaurants that sell pancakes as crepes, this was the real thing. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"When someone said \"l'habit ne fait pas le moine\" about this place, he wasn't kidding.

I originally bookmarked this place per recommendation from someone sat next to me on one of the flight I took earlier this year, then shortly after that, I saw a familiar Yelper's review about this place. My chance to try here finally came when I paused from traveling.  Like I said in the beginning, I wouldn't have came here if I didn't know about this place.

Once you step inside, it was very lovely. It looks like owned by a French couple, husband is a chef and wife is a server. Cute decor, makes you think you are in the countryside of France.

French onion soup (Soupe √† l'oignon) was the best I've ever had. I normally get tired of eating onion soup after while as it gets too salty, but this one had a nice flavor (mild enough to eat the whole bowl), I enjoyed to the last bit. Bowl is very large, soup could be just enough meal alone.

As recommended by my seatmate from that flight, I tried their crepe.  Crepe Madame was served with French fried (frite). Cheese, egg, crepe was cooked just so perfectly, it was easy to eat the whole thing very quick. 

Very lovely place to enjoy your branch or lunch. Great way to start leisurely weekend."}
{"text":"Onion soup is my favorite and like in France. It's great place to enjoy French food. My kids like \"croque monsieur\" and \"croque madame\"."}
{"text":"Can I give a bazillion stars!!!!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place, 100% authentic.  They don't just have French food, I had the Italian panini and it was to die for! For dessert I had crepes with Nutella....O.M. Geeeee!!!! It was soooo good.

I loved that I took my 90 year old neighbor here and she is from France and still speaks fluent French, and both the owner and her daughter, the waitress, spoke to her her French, it totally made her day!! 

I took my neighbor there because I saw it on a local PBS show called \"Check Please!\" 

This place is very small and very quaint, if you blink you'll miss it, but don't give up, go around the block like we did, you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Nice cozy and intimate coffee shop with variety of food where I didn't expect it at all. The owners which are a lovely couple are French, so it's not just the name! :)
I ordered a breakfast burrito with goat cheese, ham, and spinach which was delicious. The coffee tasted fresh and smooth too."}
{"text":"On a rare day-during-the-day off together, Peg and I try to find place in our 'hood that is good. We are so spoiled by places south of us, we are picky!  Anywho...this place is a true find!  It is situated in the Design Center on Hayden and a lovely mom-and-pop (Arnaud and Caroline Catois) 11-table gem. As would be expected, great coffee and incredibly good and varied crepes. The crepe monsieur (Dijon mustard, ham, swiss cheese, white sauce) and the crepe montagnarde (red bell pepper, potatoes, gruyere cheese, prosciutto) were excellent. The crepes themselves were wonderfully crisp on the edge but not overdone. OJ was good and service was attentive without hovering. It is so nice to have a spot that isn't a chain and serves chef (not organization) driven meals!  Dr. B"}
{"text":"Only knock is the bathrooms feel like you are back in a tiny cafe and they are a little dirty but the Food is amazing. Crepes are awesome. French onion soup is great. Goat cheese panini is delicious."}
{"text":"I had the goat cheese panini and it was DELISH!!!!  Adorable little spot with great service  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing French crepes you will ever have!!!!! The place is cute inside and is family owned.  The prices are reasonable.  We also really like Swedish pancakes and you can get those at the Breakfast Joynt in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this hidden spot by my new co-workers.  We decided to have a lunch meeting here.  It's located in the Scottsdale Design Center so you have to look for that huge grey building and then you will come upon this quaint spot.

We were greeted by the kind hostess that just so happend to be french.  I love it when places have a touch of authenticity when possible.  The interior is simple yet it has the proper touches of a French style cafe.  One side of the cafe opens into the main hall of the design center so you can people watch as you are waiting for your meal.  


I decided to order the Parisian Panini with a side of fruit salad and both of my lunch guests ordered the Turkey Panini with fries for the side.  The wait was fine and once the food came out I basically devoured my panini.  I would say that this is hands down the best panini I have ever had.  My co-workers agreed as they cleaned their plates too!

I will certainly be back for another panini....especially since it's convenient.  Next time I will try one of their mouth-watering desserts."}
{"text":"This little French cafe serve authentic French food. I had lunch combo which was chicken panini like sandwich and of course French onion soup and it was excellent! 
The cafe itself has the French touch decor, but yet casual. You feel like it's really in France. The waitress/owner maybe was very nice and she is French as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I and my sister and brother in law were browsing the stores at the Design Center and decided we wanted (I was starving) lunch.  We had passed by this place on the way in and after confirming that my wife, who is vegan and gluten free, could find something to eat, we sat down.  

Our waitress (who I think may have been an owner) was from Paris.  She knew the menu and, IMO, knew french food.  While I'm no expert, my brother in law has spent quite a bit of time in France.  He was impressed with her knowledge of classic French food.  

My wife and her sister ordered the basil tomato soup. To be honest, I was expeecting it to be boring but it was absolutely delicious.  Warm and just thick enough.  Just the right amount of heat. 

I ordered a cup of the French onion soup and the Croque Monsiuer.  The soup was salty and oniony (bad word but...) and I polished it off. The Croque Monsiuer was simply perfect.  Cheese, bread with a super crunchy crust, perfect filling. My brother in law said it was authentic French.  

This is a hidden gem that you have to find.  Look for it and you won't regret the find."}
{"text":"Been going here since they first opened. Used to work nearby and it was a weekly staple but now working and living across town every time I'm close I get my meal! The sandwiches are amazing and the salad dressing is delicious and tart. If you have room for dessert the nutella crepes are divine and big enough to split. The owners are amazing people and when I call she recognizes my voice and knows my order! She even knows my husband when he calls to pick me up food when I'm having a bad day. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I had the goat cheese panini, and it disappeared before I knew what happened! It was phenomenal. The pesto on the panini was very tasty! I also had a cappuccino and an almond tile cookie. The cookie was thin, crispy, and deliciously sweet. I highly recommend this little restaurant."}
{"text":"I love French food and have been on a search for any French restaurants. I found this via Yelp and since it was close to work, decided to give it a try for lunch. First, its location is kind of hard to find. It's in a shopping center near some industrial type businesses. Not a normal place to find a restaurant. Second, the inside seems a little rundown. There are plenty of tables/chairs, but all tables have that tacky red/white checkered tablecloths and the chairs are mismatched. The chair I sat in actually appeared to be falling apart and was held together with tape. 

When my husband and I arrived, there were maybe two or three other patrons. There isn't a hostess station but rather an area where you can place to-go orders and pay for your meal. This is connected to the back/kitchen area. There was no one to greet us and we almost walked out. From the back, a woman suddenly appeared and told us to sit anywhere. We slunk over to a two person table and sat down to browse the menu. 

There appeared to be only one woman working and a chef in back. The woman seemed nice enough, but she mainly seemed stressed out. Eventually, she stopped by and asked what we wanted to drink (water) and she was quick to bring our water, but we waited a few more minutes before she came back to take our order. 

I ordered the Chef sandwich (ham, brie, caramelized onions, and tomato on a baguette). My husband ordered a sandwich as well but I can't remember what it was. (Might have been the chicken or turkey.) Our food arrived relatively quickly and was tasty. When you order a sandwich, you can pick a side (salad, chips, fries, etc). We both ordered a salad as our side.

When we were finished, we waited for the check but it never came. Eventually, I went up to the to-go counter and waited patiently for the woman to come back out. There were some cookies in a small display case on the counter and they looked delicious, but we were running late and needed to get back to work.  I paid with credit card and we were on our way.

Final impressions: A little turned off by the atmosphere and how slow the service was. I felt like a huge inconvenience. Not sure if we visited on an off day, so I might give it another chance since the food was good."}
{"text":"Great food.  Friendly staff.  Try the quiches and French onion soup.  Don't leave without an almond croissant."}
{"text":"One incredible restaurant.  The owner from France  with his wife does one great  job.  I had the 3 egg scramble with smoked salmon, cream cheese and dill $7.75 (to die for).  I could go but you need to put this one on your bucket list."}
{"text":"09/05/12

Was hoping to make it in for breakfast, but was too late.  The only breakfast items left were almondine shells and a couple of strawberry fruit tarts.  I opted to try a cappuccino and an almond shell, while I waited for my Chef panino ($7.80 for a full order, with side salad) to arrive.  I believe the shells went for 50 or 75 cents each.  It was a very nice way to begin (or end!) a meal.  The panino was very delightful!  Loved the crunchy exterior of the pressed ciabatta, and the combination of thick-cut ham, brie, caramelized onions, and pesto made my mouth (and brain!) very happy!  Eating half of the leftovers a few hours later proved to be almost as good, even without reheating the sandwich in the toaster oven, and I polished the rest of the panino for breakfast the next day.  I recall that the salad dressing (on the side) was nothing to write home about, but I appreciated the added greens to round out the meal.

I docked a star for the cafe's mediocre decor.  I didn't feel like I was in a French cafe.  I can't even recall if the music playing was French.  Additionally, the only other people there, besides the server (also owner?) and cook, was a table of elderly women playing an actual game of mahjong- a Chinese tile game (with many variations possible) played on a table with three or four people, not the computer memory game.  (I wonder- in France, do French people play mahjong in American restaurants?)  Was tickled to see that my receipt tray had the Mona Lisa on it- cute!  Another star docked for having weak coffee.  Yes, great coffee service deserves a full star in my book...  The cappuccino was the worst I'd ever shelled $4 for, and no wonder-- the drip coffee I replaced the caloric cup with tasted almost like water.  I've wanted to come back a few times since, to try breakfast here, but if I can't look forward to a great cup of cafe avec un bon petit dejeuner, then why even bother?  Perhaps it was an off-day for coffee?  I will visit again very soon and see if breakfast is just as fun!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I love it so much!

I eat so much food there which is unusual for me since I don't like the feeling of being over full. This food is great because it doesn't make you feel like crap after. Both times, I had the same thing because I am obsessed with it: French onion soup, quiche Lorraine with the side salad and a couple of crepes. They are so reasonably priced that you could order the whole menu and not feel bad about it."}
{"text":"So stopped by here on a business trip. I had ratatouille with poached eggs and croissant. Way better meal than any hotel breakfast hands down. Cappuccino as well no special milks or anything just straight forward. Stopping by on the next trip."}
{"text":"Tr√®s bien! Cafe Paris is a cozy little eatery across the street from Costco, serving sandwiches, soups, and salads. In addition to French style sandwiches, they offer paninis, and a few items that are Southwest-influenced (e.g., quesadillas).

I ordered a croque monsieur, and tried some of the French onion soup. The croque monsieur was everything I'd imagined this French lunchtime favorite would be. The bread was crispy and toasted, with some Dijon mustard, tender ham, melted Swiss cheese, with some melted cheese on top. The combination of flavors and textures was excellent. The French onion soup was served piping hot, with a generous serving of melted cheese on top. The flavors in the soup had a deep, rich beef flavor melded with some sweet caramelized onion. The side I chose with the sandwich- a \"French taboule\", was couscous mixed with dried cranberries. Unfortunately the couscous was a bit bland and a little gummy tasting to me. 

Service was warm and friendly. 

In addition to the indoor seating, there is a small outdoors area with 2 tables if it's nice outside and you want to eat in the sun. 

Until next time, √† bient√¥t Cafe Paris!"}
{"text":"Everything was delightful! I expected smaller portions... but I loved having leftovers. Quiet setting. I was slightly disappointed by the plain interior, but very friendly service and delightful food, albeit felt a bit expensive."}
{"text":"We love this place!  It reminds us of the crepes we had in France on our honeymoon.  It's small and quaint.  The crepes are delicious!  Tried the crepes chef this time.  Would highly recommend.  Comes with 2 crepes and a side; had the yummy couscous."}
{"text":"I had seen this very unassuming place before in the Scottsdale Airpark and had always been curious about it, so when a co-worker suggested we go here, I jumped on it.  I am in love with this place. It is owned by a couple who transplanted to AZ several years ago, and they opened this place in 2007. The paninis are absolutely magnifique, and the croissants are tender and delicate and baked fresh every morning. I was so impressed with them, that I suggested my work use them for a catering event a couple weeks later. They did a fantastic job...everyone who attended the event wanted to know where the food was from and where they could go to get it. 

I really hope to see this place succeed as it is pretty much run by the couple only (he cooks and she takes the orders and serves the food). Don't let the location detract you from visiting here!"}
{"text":"These are some of the best crapes have ever had. This place is a real gem high-quality food expertly prepared very friendly atmosphere. I highly recommend this place you would not be disappointed. I have the onion soup was expertly prepared tasted great I felt like I was in France. The creeps are generous portions and beautifully cooked in the flavor was outstanding best grips of ever had!!!"}
{"text":"I went to the cafe with a few coworkers for lunch after seeing a my fellow Yelpers reviews on the place. Overall I would say the ambiance leaves much to be desired, but the food is definitely worth the venture.

When you walk in you'll see a bunch of hodge podge acrylic paintings on the wall and picnic table settings around the room. I kind of felt like I was walking into an antique store that also served food. 

The owner/server was very friendly. I was excited to try the food after hearing her French accent. I ended up ordering the Crepes Bastille...and oh my, best crepe I've had in awhile. The texture of the crepe was soft and thin, and the filling was magnificent. Savory caramelized onions and mushrooms contrasted the sweeter cheese and cream flavors. The chicken was tender, and the hints of Tarragon were not overpowering. I'll definitely be back to try dessert! 

The decor needs a face lift and I wish they had a better hot tea selection, but I'll keep coming back for the most important part. Their scrumptious food!"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely LOVE this little gem! BEST onion soup I've had, even better than onion soup I've had in Paris. Crepes were delightful; have yet to find better crepes in AZ. You really get a lot of food for what little you pay. The crepes are huge! The bowl of soup is a very generous size. We had hoped the fries would be as wonderful as the \"frites\" we devoured in Paris, but they offer their own sauce with fries (if you ask), and I quite enjoyed it. A very pleasant experience during our first visit to this hidden treasure. We will definitely return to try more items off their menu."}
{"text":"First off, VERY unassuming.  Could barely find the place.  Walk in, not much to write home about.  Kitschy, bland decor.  I will say we were a bit nervous we made a bad decision.  We ordered and the food was served...err, I dunno...    

First bite.......I just couldn't believe it.  A simple dish like quiche Lorraine never tasted so good.  Even texture was unlike any quiche I have ever had.  To be honest, I actually think about it from time to time and can't wait to go back.  

We also got a crepe. It was savory but can't remember which one we got but it was also really good.  It wasn't on the breakfast menu because we asked if we could get something off the lunch menu even though it was before the lunch hours.  

I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excited to try this place. French Toast was falling apart by the time I got home ..i throw away after 1 bite... Penn was not that impressive. I expected better ham.. basha sells better boar head sandwich. I spent $20 for two dishes and I am still hungry."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  Super quick delicious breakfast of crepes and the ratatouille was perfect!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food- wow! I had an Parmesan, bacon and chive omelette, my girlfriend got the goat cheese and basil with added prosciutto omelette and they were both incredibly. 

They were out of plain croissants, which turned out to be great, because we were made aware that they have almond and chocolate croissants. We got one of each, and shared a side of roasted potatoes. The almond croissant was one of the best pieces of baked good I've ever had, and I have a gluten intolerance. Totally worth it.  

They make everything but the bread in house, so that means visits back to try everything else, and get croissants for other people who need to know .

 2 double cappuccinos, just as delicious as everything else, and we were very happy campers! 

It was much busier than it seemed to usually be since we're going during winter vacation time in AZ, so a little slower than usual probably, but we were in no rush, so no problem.

Awesome food- definitely check it out if you enjoy quality cooking!"}
{"text":"Nothing remarkable The ambience is very pleasant (though kitschy - you know, Eiffel tours mixed with French country roosters)  and the owner is charming, but onion soup was watery and Italian panini sandwich greasy, with prosciutto smelling like it was nearing its expiration date. Coffee is just a quality of an average gas station roast."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! I had the Monte Carlo sandwich and the tomato soup. The sandwich was excellent...the salmon was very fresh and tasted great. The soup was chock full of basil with a light consistency. It's a little confusing to find as it's located inside of a home design center. All in all, a great little lunch spot. Friendly and quick service too. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Oh, dear....hate to have to rate so low but I must......at least as far as their catering goes.  
The main foods were just average, the presentation was poor, nothing special at all.  
Bacon, shrimp and chicken were included for this vegetarian event.  
The salads were so tightly packed into their bowls that the guests weren't able to serve themselves easily.
The croutons, cheeses, tomatoes, and other salad ingredients were just on top so basically, after the first few guests managed to get some salad, there was only lettuce left. 
The lemon dessert was a plus and the other sweets were good but again, the presentation was poor.
Very disappointing for this once in a lifetime event."}
{"text":"L'habit ne fait pas le moine

I walked right by this place, as it shares the same storefront as Frazee Paint.  Don't let the curb appeal fool you.  Prenez votre cul √† l'int√©rieur!!!

Walking in, the place reminded me of a French Bistro... and mind you... I've never even been to Denmark.  It had such a quaint feel that I simply had to sit down and order lunch.

Figuring the escargot (my car go, one sixty, swiftly) would be a little BIG'gy, the obvious choice was the Eiffel Tower (ET), comprised of: turkey, ham, bacon, Swiss cheese, tomato, avocado served on 3 (YES, THREE!  This is the NOTORIOUS B.I.G. MAC OF SANDWICHES) layers of sourdough bread $9.67 (tax incl)

Seriously, the ET was so tall, I couldn't fit my petite pie hole around it, even after unhinging my lower jaw... this sucker was a tall sandwich... which serenaded me, while draped in a blue wig

     Eat me, ea-ea-eat me
     I'll infect you with my avo and
     Fill you with my bacon

And thanks to the Desert Ray's crepe debacle 0f 2016, I just knew I'd be trying CPFB&C's crepes... and they were unparalleled!  

Two crepes w/fresh red berries sauce and scoop of french vanilla ice cream for $8.59 (tax incl) is my new guiltless pleasure, as some guy on Yahoo Answers touted that crepes are actually good for you"}
{"text":"Ooh lala. Who knew you could get a real croissant in the Phoenix area?! Combine that with a legitimate goat cheese and basil omelette, some unsalted butter, and good coffee, and you have a legitimate Parisian breakfast at an amazingly affordable price. It's an unusual location, tucked in next to a paint store. Once you find your way, you will enjoy the cheerful decor, and the original artwork on the walls. They offer catering as well. Soups, sandwiches, quiche Lorraine, crepes. I strongly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Such a great place. Food was fantastic. Kids ran around and played and it was just fine because the restaurant was empty. I think it's slow because of bad location. Who knows. I just know I'll be going a lot."}
{"text":"Excellent food and consistently excellent service. I have tried their pan bagnat sandwich (which includes tuna, sliced boiled eggs, bell peppers) and the choice of side.On a day like today,  I sat outside on the patio and ordered  the chicken panini  with french fries and fruit salad. And of course I had to have an Orangina!

Cafe Paris is a charming little cafe and the owners Arnaud and Caroline could not be more kind and welcoming. Next time, I will try the crepes.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My favorite Scottsdale lunch! Great sandwiches, salads, panninis, omelettes, crepes and a few French specialties. Super casual in the Designer building on N. Hayden. You'd never know about it!"}
{"text":"I love the paninis at this place. The chicken pesto panini was fantastic. French fries are standard fries. The setting inside seems like a French bistro which was a big surprise based on the outside.

Service is a bit slow but I appreciate that it is the family running everything"}
{"text":"This place is both adorable AND affordable... I can't (and I won't) believe it's actually located in Scottsdale. 

Cookies for $0.40. Fresh salad topped with a giant salmon fillet for $7.40. Paninis galore for $7.80. I know, this all sounds far too reasonable to be true, but it's the real deal. 

The Gardener (aka ratatouille panini) was a major hit amongst everyone, and it's meat and dairy-free! Health and French food in the same place? This place just gets more and more unbelievable. 

Between the atmosphere, pricing, and food, Cafe Paris seems like it's in a location far from, \"somewhere near where I take my car in for maintenance.\" Cheaper than France, more authentic than Scottsdale, and tastier than anything else I can get for less than eight bucks."}
{"text":"Easiest 5 star ever. Croissants are authentique. Omelettes soft and fluffy. Picture ourselves on Ave Foch for dejeuner. Inside design Center."}
{"text":"Authentic French cafe...total hidden gem! The ratatouille with goat chews crepe was amazing as was the chocolate desert crepe."}
{"text":"Loved breakfast here. I got a cappuccino and a veggie omelet with a croissant. It was all delish. My husband got French toast and he asked the chef to make it with Nutella and strawberries. It was amazing! Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Yummy! The French onion soup was really good, as well as the sandwiches. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been a customer for a years.  I love their food and croissants.  Cute place and friendly owners. My favorite French place in AZ so far. Love it!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  They have a ratatouille omelette.  How could you not love that?  The croissants are made in-house, the coffee is not disappointing and the prices are reasonable.
If I lived closer, I could easily see Cafe Paris being a once a week visit for me.
Down side?  Welll, once we had finished eating, it seemed like we were ignored.  No more water or coffee.  Otherwise, this would have been a 4 star review."}
{"text":"The food is fine. There's nothing particularly special about Cafe Paris. 
  The owner is nice. Prices are reasonable. Food is satisfactory.  
The location is hard to find. Bathrooms are disgusting. Cafe is clean enough. It's inside of a design store. 
 If I was in the neighborhood I would eat there again. Won't make a special trip though."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem. Breakfast - delicious. Owner/Chef - delightful! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Cute place to have a little snack and coffee. I've been wanting to try this place for a long time. Crepe madam was really good, the egg was cooked perfectly just how I like it. 
My hubby said the cafe latte was really good. I couldn't try it because they didn't have non-dairy alternative. Please have soy, almond or coconut milk for lactos intolerant folks like me :(.  
Dessert crepe with Nutella was good. But I was little disappointed they didn't have more fresh fruit options.
Overall, it was what I expected just not overly impressed. I'd like to go back and try their panini one day though. Our waitress was really nice and made us feel welcomed even when we walked in at 2:30 just 30 min before they closed."}
{"text":"Not a bad thing about this place. Well, maybe the location is a bit lacking  on views but the food, prices and people are amazing! The Panini's (all 7 of them) are crispy, melty cheesy and full of flavor. The salads are fresh and fill you up and the lunch special #1 of a sandwich and a piece of chocolate cake? How can you resist!  We work close by and go here often."}
{"text":"Wow! Authentic home made French bistro fare in the air park. And very convenient if you are painting your house (shared space with paint store). The owner was very friendly. The cookies were extremely good too. Must try it."}
{"text":"Crepe Bastille was awesome. The place is a little hard to find, but worth the hunt. It's in the design center building."}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall place I found on yelp! My panini was good but the shinning star was my couscous! Would go back for just a bowl of that!"}
{"text":"We just went here today for a work lunch and it was wonderful! I had a salmon sandwich with cucumbers and dill sauce on sourdough. My coworkers had a panini. The flavor was great and is owned and operated by a French couple. We had a crepe for desert and it was good."}
