{"text":"This is my favorite Pizza place in North Hills. Having recently moved from the city and having my favorite pizza place there I needed to find one comparable. This place it is.  The pizza is delicious. Also, when you walk in the owner makes you feel like you have been friends forever. Pizza was ready within 15 minutes as promised. Great pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered the Supremo Deluxe Pizza and it was really tasty.  It arrived warm and intact (no toppings displaced or stuck to the lid) and was a nice meal with their Large Salad.  Their prices are reasonable and their delivery time was between 30-40 mins which is within my expectation for a Saturday night. The delivery person was friendly and efficient.  I will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"I stopped at the one on three degree road about a week ago I place my order there was a kid standing there with his fingers buried in his shoe scratching his foot walk back and started making the pizza didn't bother to wash his hands I walked out will never go there again"}
{"text":"Best calzones I've had in a long time. Actually ordering 1 for dinner tonight!!"}
{"text":"DO NOT order this pizza place after 8 on a Saturday, have had it before and it was very good, ordered tonight was told 30 minutes for delivery waited an hour. Almost everything we ordered was Burnt, and they forgot our salad. When I called back they gave me to whom I believe was a manage of the place and she said \"well we could have the driver bring it back or what do you want me to do about it.\" Very disappointed maybe it was just a bad night for them but will not be ordering from here for a while."}
{"text":"I stopped by here yesterday by myself for dinner.  I had recently seen that this pizza place had moved in nearby and after a positive recommendation from a friend who has visited their Mars location, I decided that I should visit it.  Since I didn't know their phone number I went out to their website and was pleased to find out that I could order online.  The process was quick and painless and my receipt said that my pizza should be ready in 15 minutes.  I ended up arriving to the store about 30 minutes later.  There is not much of a store here as there is a counter inside that you order from and that is it.  Whenever I arrived my pizza was already paid for and ready so I spent no longer than a minute inside before I was walking back out to my car with the pizza.  With all of the options on the website I decided to order a traditional crust large plain pizza with buffalo sauce on one half of the pizza and red sauce on the other half.  How cool is it that you can get the pizza with half sauces and for no extra cost?  They actually have 5 different sauces that you choose from.   As with all pizzas this one can be broken down into the three major components: crust, sauce and cheese.  The crust of this pizza was of medium thickness and was probably my least favorite part of the pizza.  That's not to say it wasn't good as it was cooked nicely but in some places I felt there was a bit too much dough and almost didn't think that the crust was crispy enough.  The sauce of this pizza is where it really stood out.  Normally the sauce is almost an afterthought for me but here it was actually better than the cheese.  The red sauce had a great blend of spices and really had me taking notice of it instead of the cheese.  So while the cheese was good I felt that it got a little lost here.  Meanwhile the buffalo sauce reminded me of a cross between a white pizza sauce and Franks red hot.  It was tasty and had a little bit of heat but not enough to set your mouth on fire.  It actually really helped to enhance the cheese on that side of the pizza and I really enjoyed the combination.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be heading back here again in the future.  I really loved both of the sauces that I had on my pizza and also the cheese.  So I am really looking forward to coming back with my wife and also checking out their thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"This was one of the first pizza places I tried after moving to town based on Yelp reviews. I ordered a Large Sicilian Deluxe and 12 Spicy Garlic Parmesan Wings for delivery. It ended up running me over $30 which I was a little shocked by but my own fault for not looking at prices. I'm not worried about the price except for the fact that what I received in my opinion was just an average run of the mill pizza with some wings. Nothing really special. I figured this was a local Mom and Pop shop but it didn't seem like that. The pizza itself was pretty bland and dry. It was a step above something like Dominos in my opinion. Like I said, not terrible, but nothing special.  The wings were more of the same. Fairly dry and hardly and sauce. Although the sauce I did get had a good taste.  The delivery was timely but looking at the experience as a whole, I feel like there are better options in the area that I'd consider over Supremo's when it comes to cost vs. product."}
{"text":"Over the last couple months, I've gotten several things from Supremo's and I've never had anything I didn't thoroughly enjoy.  My favorite thus far is the pretzel bites...they are awesome!  The first time I ordered them, they were really salty.  I had ordered them a few times later, but requested lite salt.  I love the thin crust pizza so much better and not as doughy. Salads are a good portion, and the hoagies are huge and quite tasty.  One more favorite, the Chicken Ranch Dough roll...yum!!  I just moved and there isn't a Supremo's nearby...Need to open in Crafton!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in the North Hills.  After trying just about every slice in the area, I cannot get enough of their pizza.  Add to it fantastic bread sticks, great pepperoni rolls for just $4.75, and the option to get wings or pierogis and you cannot go wrong.   The staff is friendly and they are quick with their deliveries.   Their on line ordering system is also top notch.  Just know that this is a take out only place.    If you are looking for good home made pizza with great service, give this place a try.  They will not disappoint."}
{"text":"This pizza tastes like it's from chuckee cheese's pizza but even worse. Also tried the steak hoagie bread and was soggy when I took it out of the wrapper. If that's not bad enough they are scam artists. After asking if there are any specials I was told yes and they upsized my pizza from what I was going to get because of the deal. When the driver showed up he informed the person that was with me that answered the door that some lady told him he needs to collect a coupon from us. Since we obviously did not have one he said he is going to have to charge us extra money. This to me is complete non sense and these workers have no sense of customer service. They are also cheap for that I mean wow! Do not go here!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was a long time customer of Luciano's Six Pack in NH. Over time their product lost its quality, the owners stopped caring. Orders were screwed up on a regular basis - blah.  I am so glad to have Supremo's Pizza in the North Hills and I am so glad they are willing to deliver to my home over by Passavant Hospital.  The delivery guys are always friendly, the service is fast, I love the Thick Cut pizza, calazones, and subs.  Not so crazy about the bone in wings (Mark's North Park Lounge are better) but everything else in my book is just great.  Hopefully, I will be ordering from these guys for a long time!!!!   Glad to have another choice then Luciano's, Pizza Roma (ugh), and Vocelli's!"}
