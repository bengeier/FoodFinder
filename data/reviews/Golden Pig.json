{"text":"Never evrr everrrrr did i Love Korean food before...Until Golden Pig Happened. I am from seattle ..Yet I make sure everytime I fly to PIttsburgh I visit this place... The food is amazing .  Do try their Buldag Chicken.. Seriously you wont regret the long waits here...Try it out"}
{"text":"Maybe I went in expecting too much based on the other reviews.  I thought it was good, but not great.  The owner is like your Korean aunty.  She jokes about how she's the only person there and how the service is so bad.  But it's not bad, just slow because she does it all herself.  I understood this going in.  The vegetable fried rice was just ok.  Could've had a bit more flavor.  Kim chee was also just ok.  The kalbi was pretty good though.  I'm used to having the bone still on there, but they were nice thick pieces with good BBQ flavor.  Very good.  The bulgogi was also pretty good, but could've had just a little more flavoring.  I agree with one of the other reviewers here.  Dasonii out in Robinson Township is better, and a bit closer to my house too.  But if you're in the area, it's not a bad place to eat.  Just be prepared to wait a while."}
{"text":"The good reviews here are spot on. The pickle, spicy slaw, and kimchi tasted fresh and homemade and paired with the kimchi pancake so every bite was different. The mandu (dumplings) had a beef filling that had so much flavor - possibly fresh lemongrass? The bean thread noodles (jap chai) and bulgogi plates were almost licked clean. There was so much flavor we never even touched the red pepper sauce and soy sauce on the table. Agreeing with other reviews, very small, one owner cooking and serving fresh food so the food may take a couple minutes if it is busy. The servings seemed just right to me. Takeout may be the way to go. I can't wait until we are back in the area. I would also like to try the ramen or another soup and the super spicy chicken but might have to also have the jap chae a few more times."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Fantastic flavors. Unique experience. Squid and vegetables is unforgettable."}
{"text":"I have to give credit to the Yelpers who have gone before me on this one.  Everything was exactly as described: - Odd, hole-in-the-wall location? check - Tiny eating space? check - One woman as chef/hostess/server/busperson? check - Long wait? check (nearly an hour) - Incredibly fresh, tasty and authentic food? check  I ordered the Korean pancake with mixed vegetables and hot green pepper, which was delectable in addition to clearing my sinuses.  I also tried the Jop-Chae, which is a sweet potato noodle dish with vegetables.  This was also fantastic.  It was a subtle mix of flavors, including sesame seeds and sesame oil.  The food is definitely worth the wait.  I arrived at 7pm and was advised it would be 45 minutes before she could make my order.  I finally got it about an hour after my order, but a small price to pay for the good eats.  Fortunately, I had a decent amount of spare time and sat outside watching a softball game being played on the field behind the restaurant.  Highly recommended if you plan ahead."}
{"text":"If you want a mom-and-pop shop (you'll just get mom part---she was running everything solo!) and a hole in the wall, this is the place to go. Worth the 1 hour drive and will be back again. Simple yet very tasty choices."}
{"text":"First time I went here, my food was to spicy and hot to eat.  Second time it was better, they have good kimchi.  It is definitely different, but I haven't come across something that has made me want to come back to it.  The place is sooooo tiny, it is a little awkward.  I had the beef but it was little to sweet for my taste, wasn't crazy over it.  So far, I have only liked the kimchi.  The guy cuts the cabbage outside on a table.  It is definitely authentic.  But I have had better."}
{"text":"This is a lovely place, we had a great time here despite the long wait. This is literally a one mans business. The lady take ur order and cook for you. The place is artistically decorated, the food is authentic."}
{"text":"Love Yong and love the golden pig!  I cam eat there once a week and never ever get sick of it!!!"}
{"text":"Located in the middle of no where. Great Korean Food. As authentic as it gets in my opinion. Which they had more room for seating."}
{"text":"We are regulars. My husband and I have been going there about once a month for the last 4 years. Tried everything on the menu. Kimchi pancake is a must because it's better than any other Korean restaurant in the Pittsburgh area-- crispy, chewy and not too thick so you'll have space for other goodies on the menu. My husband used to hate tofu but her tofu dish transformed him. Now he orders it almost every time he goes there. Kalbi (beef short ribs) is very rich tasting and cooked to perfection (medium rare if you don't specify). Menu is small but everything is worth a try. The restaurant is smaller than many people's living room and it's an experience just to watch. Go if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Delicious! Everything is made to order, from scratch (even peeling the potatoes!). I highly recommend this place. It's pretty much just take-out, there are a few tables inside and outside, and plan to wait for your food, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Love it! Unique experience. It's like going to a friend's house for food. The owner cooks the food and talks to you while she cooks. It's very small only 2 or 3 small parties max but the food is do amazing it's worth the wait and small seating. If you never have tried Korean good you won't be disappointed when you go."}
{"text":"My mom and I drove thirty minutes to check this place out. We had trouble finding it, and spent an extra twenty minutes looking for it. We finally found it and when we go to the door, the owner says, \"Long wait, ha ha!\" She then proceeds to ignore us and we just stand there, looking like idiots. I haven't tried the food, and I honestly was disappointed. The food does look like real, tasty Korean food. But I am judging on the service, which was just rude."}
{"text":"When you walk into a restaurant, absorb the scene for a minute, and can immediately think, \"I'm definitely coming back again,\" you know you've found yourself a gem. This is probably the homiest place I have ever eaten out at, where you can tell Mrs. Kwon genuinely enjoys what she is doing. The first time, we went at the end of the night on a weekday so we didn't have to wait long at all. It was amazing to see a place where it seems like the norm for customers to lend a helping hand. It was like being at home where bringing the dishes or cleaning the table was something my mom always appreciated help with.   Having had tons of Korean food from years in Cali, the food here really isn't about fancy presentation, new food fads, or super intense dishes. It's just simple, home-style dishes done well and with lots of heart. My favorites so far are the pancake and squid, and of course, I always like the random array of banchan (the fried fish is yum!). I guess the dish I don't really care for is the ramen, but that's mostly because I'm biased by the way my mom makes her special version of instant ramen. Because this place is really popular, try going at an off hour. Hopefully, you'll be able to catch a time when the crowds aren't big and you can chat with Mrs. Kwon -- she's such an auntie is my book! Even though I'm not a regular, when I do come she makes me feel welcome as though I am one. Regardless, be patient and relax...eating a meal here is an experience and not only filling up an empty stomach :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food all around. Mandu (dumplings) is awesome. I've had the Bulgogi in the past and that is always good... this time I got the spicy chicken (I forget what they call it) and the flavors were great, however it is dark meat chicken... so if you want white meat you might have to specify that. Also, any place that has homemade Ramen noodles on the menu is okay by me.  This place is a must try if you haven't had it before!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem outside of Pittsburgh!  I love buldak chicken here. Service is good. The only con is waiting time. But owner tells you for how long you might have to wait."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  I eat Korean food in a lot in different cities across the north east and this cool little place serves some of the best!   Very fresh flavor packed food!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good. A little pricey, but well worth it. I'm happy to pay more to patronize a business where the owner does a wonderful job and is always hard at work."}
{"text":"Awesome home style Korean cooking, I love it. Great owner, what a hard working woman she is! Everything on menu is delicious."}
{"text":"I was in Canonsburg for a church meeting today.  I drove through Cecil and remembered hearing about an amazing Korean restaurant in this town.  On the way home from my meeting, I thought why not stop by The Golden Pig for lunch?  I am so glad I stopped by!  This 10 seat restaurant is presided by the most colorful Korean lady.  I didn't catch her name but wow, was she entertaining!  I got there at 1pm and it was still pretty packed.  And as I was finishing up, there was another couple and a family of 5 trying to get in for a late lunch.  I wanted to order just about everything on the menu.  It's a short menu, but all my Korean favorites.  I finally settled on the Daiji Bulgogi ($7.50) - Thin-sliced marinated pork in a spicy red pepper glaze.  Absolutely delicious and it came with a great assortment of banchan (Korean side dishes - seaweed and chives and kimchi).  The Daiji Bulgogi was just perfectly spicy.  The last time I had this was in Seoul last summer and it totally brought me back there in my first bite.  My bill came to $9.00 pre-tip and I ordered a Diet Coke.  I will have to make the trip to Cecil more often when I get my Korean food craving - which seems to be more often than not these days!    Why not take the trip off the beaten path and give this place a shot?  I would never have guessed finding exceptional Korean food in a sleepy little town like Cecil.  It was like being back in Seoul - an incredible feat for a one woman show serving the dining room and cooking up classic soul satisfying Korean food at the same time!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that you don't want others to find out about. It's small, very small and the food is amazing. The owner is the sweetest woman who will cook you some of the spiciest and most delicious Korean food around. The pancake with hot peppers is spicy but not unbearable. The buldak chicken is definitely spicy. The kim chi is on point! I cannot wait to go back and try more items from the menu but like I said, this place gets very busy with only the owner cooking!"}
{"text":"Love this place, small place right off of route 50, so don't blink of you'll miss it. This is definitely a gem."}
{"text":"First time there. Food was good/fresh. The mom was nice. The daughter was miserable. I asked her for two waters and a iced tea-- she pointed at the cooler and left our table. The drinks are help yourself I guess. No personality. Very rude. Anyway first time eating Korean. It was good. I prob would go back. The dumplings were great."}
{"text":"After leaving Korea I began to crave the food.  This place is as authentic as it gets without being in Korea.  No Soju, but bring your own.    Classic Kimchi and other Kimchi's are all top notch, as is everything else.  Try Kimchi Chigae..    Go if you haven't, you are really missing out."}
{"text":"So tiny and homey.  10 people would fill the place.  The owner/cook has the best personality.  Her warmth alone would keep bringing me back.  I was amazed at the spread of food.  I LOVED the Korean coleslaw.  This is as traditional Korean as you will get around here.  I'm kinda glad its off the beaten path in Cecil....it makes it feel like a special find."}
{"text":"Love. The proprietor over heard my conversation once (in the tiny space) about my love of octopus and squid. She was kind enough to give me the tentacles , which is my favorite and not commonly served. This was a long while ago, but it still sticks with me. That is caring, folks. Why on earth would you have someone cook you a meal who didn't care and pour themselves into a dish?  Home cooked food, but a sweet grandmother. Every single person that  I have met there, has been wonderful. Whether you're in a chatty mood or not, the tiny space makes strangers your neighbors. It's wonderful. A true delight."}
{"text":"Wonderful little restaurant hidden away in Cecil Township.  I love the ramen noodles in the cold of winter.  Nice hot broth, spicy flavor, and so delicious for the soul.  It is a small place, not much seating inside at all.  But take out is always a good option. Worth trying if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Absolutely exceeded expectations (which were pretty high) on every level.  An absolute must try - ideally in between lunch and dinner hours.  Young is an absolute wonder!  I will definitely be returning on all future trips back home to Cecil :)."}
{"text":"As a Korean person, I'd say the food here is delicious and legit traditional. It is a small place, but I personally liked the cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you're feeling adventurous or simply craving authentic Korean fare (and by authentic I mean recipes plucked from South Korea and completely unchanged) then the Golden Pig in Cecil is absolutely worth checking out. Fantastic food and a great atmosphere. This 12 seat restaurant has only 1 staff member though, so get there early and be prepared to spend over an hour inside."}
{"text":"Best Authentic Korean Food. The owner is also the waiter and cook. If you want to sit down you better go early or not during rush times like lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I recently experienced one of the most amazing meals of my life at Golden Pig. A friend took us there for lunch and it was outstanding. It is a tiny restaurant run by Mrs. Kwon. When I say tiny, I mean tiny. The place only has two tables and a small bar. Mrs. Kwon cooks everything herself onsite, as you order.   We ordered the korean veggie pancake and the fried sweet potatoes for our appetizers. Besides being delicious, it was full of fresh cut veggies. Along with the appetizers we also got a dish with pickled radishes and cucumbers. The radishes were a bit spicy for me but I have a delicate palette. :)  Between the four of us we ordered bulgogi, ramen and man du. I had the man du and it was incredible. If you haven't tried it yet. do it now."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I love the owner, who you'll see any time you're there, and the fact that it's tiny just makes it feel more intimate. You have to get the kimchi pancakes. The soups are always awesome. I've had the ramen and kimchi soups, and my husband loved the egg drop soup which is waaaaay better than typical egg drop. It's has substance, not just cornstarch. My 6 year old always gets the roll (I can't remember what it's called) which is just veggies in the style of a sushi roll. It's very good though, and everything is fresh and made with a lot of passion and love."}
{"text":"You get genuine Korean cuisine here. My Mom is Korean and I will bring her here sometimes to eat because she enjoys the food. The hot squid is her favorite. My kids like the beef bulgogi and chop jae. The mandoo is very good also. They do a good takeout business, because the indoor sitting area is small. Very good service and kind owner."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for the first time and it is amazing! We had the Korean pancakes, ramen and kimchi fried rice. A+ service and the meal was absolutely wonderful! Definitely making this place a regular stop"}
{"text":"Best Korean in the Burgh!!!! Anything is good and a good price as well. I like the bulgogi, short ribs, buldak, and the spicy ramen the Best Buy it is all great!!!!"}
{"text":"While the Pittsburgh area isn't always known for it's great selection of ethnic cuisine, the Golden Pig is one of PIttsburgh's best kept secrets if Korean food is of your liking.  The owner, Yong Kwon, came to the states to be closer to her grandchild; she runs this place pretty much by herself. Whenever you go, it's like sitting in her own personal kitchen. the place is small, but very cozy. Has room for about ten. This is my favorite Korean restaurant and I personally think its better than the restaurants I've been to in Korea. If you need suggestions, you can never go wrong with the kimchi pancake, the bulgogi and the mandu (Korean dumplings)."}
{"text":"It's really a one-woman show. She is such a sweetie and doesn't take a moment to pause in the kitchen, working away trying to serve everyone as fast as possible while still being friendly to all her guests an apologizing for the wait. Everything is fresh to order. EVERYTHING. I saw her get fresh veggies out of her fridge and chop them fresh for order. The only thing in a box were presoftened chapchae noodles. Imagine your mom making dinner for your family five times in a row in an hour. She is really working miracles there.  That said, the wait got pretty long while we were there, and that's with some of her regulars helping her after they finished eating. Really gives you that mom's kitchen feel. Made me smile.  Judging on the food itself alone, I don't think she's necessarily much better Asian-mom cook than many ordinary moms out there. In that respect it's not very impressive. In comparison, I have had better Mom&Pop shop Korean food in a similar type restaurant (though unfortunately located far away in Houston).  We had mandoo, daeji bulgolgi, chapchae noodles, korean pancakes. Everything tasted good and well-cooked but very ordinarily homey, and while I appreciate this and think it's the definite selling point of this adorable little shop, my parents were not impressed by the flavor and mom thought it's nothing she can't make herself... and she's probably right.   Personally, I don't feel the need to come back as long as my mom is willing to feed me. But I recommend this as an awesome Asian-mom substitute for those in need of some delicious home-made comfort food. Everything about Golden Pig is just a home-with-your-mom experience. If I had something like this near me, I'd definitely be the top regular. But I know there are students in the 'Burgh away from their moms who would loooove a place like this to get a taste of home - too bad it's located so far away from the city :("}
{"text":"The best Korean food outside of Seoul.  Worth the wait!  The veggie pancakes, mandu and daiji bulgogi are favorites.  Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Korean food anywhere.  Everything is home made and all fresh ingredients.  Worth the long wait especially with byob!"}
{"text":"This is the type of place that if it was closer to foot traffic and the city, you might never get to eat it cause of how busy it would be.  I ate the ramen bowl, vegetable pancake and the mandu, it was all flawlessly executed and served with a genuine enthusiastic smile by the owner and cook, Yong.  Perfectly priced, beyond fair.  If I lived closer I'd go once a week.  Worthy of whatever length of drive you need to make for the experience.  This is the type of place that won't be here forever as the owner expressed that when it's over, it's over, so go to at least say you did it before you can't ever again!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients. All meals prepared from scratch. Incredibly yummy! This is the best Korean food in Pittsburgh. Everything on the menu is awesome, but my favorite is the spicy squid. Done just right, not tough and chewy like other wanna-be Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"This is such a diamond in the rough!It is so small and quaint so I wanted to wait for the right time. I went in hungry and left full! The flavor was such a nice change compared to anything else I have had lately. I was greeted by a friendly woman and man. The woman was in the kitchen and the man was cleaning off all the little pigs they collect. He said he cleans them all every 2 weeks. That speaks volumes to me and I knew I was going to enjoy my meal.  I started off the Korean experience with the hot green pepper Korean pancake witch was amazing!!! The hot pepper sauce/ paste was so full of flavor and the pancake was fresh and hot! They also gave me a small plate with some kim chi and Korean style cole slaw.  Next, I had the Sae Woo Bo Kum (sautéed shrimp). This was my favorite dish and main entree. The flavors were so powerful and enjoyable. The ingredients were all fresh and cooked to perfection!  Finally, I also ordered the spicy ramen! It was full of flavor and the broth was amazing for my head cold. I did not finish the noodles but I did finish all the broth.  I highly recommend making a trip if you want fresh Korean cuisine. It is very small so keep that in mind during peak dinner hours."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and his parents go here all the time. It is a cute little restaurant in Cecil PA . The owner is very sweet and she cooks everything by herself. She has about one person serving and it is advisable to call in advance. She cooks everything while you wait so expect to be there for a while. It is a great experience. The food is Korean and mildly spicy. We had some kind of pancake with Kimchi with a dry korean coleslaw as she cooked our entrees. She also served us green tea. I had some kind of teriyaki tofu with veges that was pretty good and my boyfriend had the kimchi shigae. It came in a huge hot pot and he loved. The rice was the most amazing she calls it special rice and IT IS special. All in all i love this place it is very private and a true gem in pittsburgh."}
{"text":"You wouldn't think to find authentic Korean food in Cecil, but it exists at the Golden Pig! As many others have mentioned, the space is so incredibly tiny and truthfully, it feels like you're in someone's kitchen and not very much like a restaurant. Knowing this, we ordered takeout and that was the way to go since we had a large group. There was no way the restaurant could have accommodated our group of six.   The food was quite delicious. My husband and I ordered the Korean pancake with kim chi, spicy pork bulgogi, and the japchae. All amazing. Quite honestly, you could taste the love and care put into the food. The best way for me to describe this feeling is how you warm you feel when you're at home with your family, eating your favorite dish your mother made when you were a child. Am I making sense? Doesn't matter. The food at Golden Pig is legit.   If you're searching for delicious Korean food, come to Golden Pig. If you love some spicy food, come to Golden Pig. If you're looking for something new to try, come to the Golden Pig. Heck, you don't really need any other reasons. Just go already..."}
{"text":"CLOSED!?!? I just came over from Canonsburg because of the high ratings in Yelp but found this little hole in the wall locked (with the sign out front still reading OPEN). It is 3:40pm on Monday afternoon so they should be open, but there are no signs of life.  Very frustrated and hungry......."}
{"text":"The food was tasty and not expensive. Unfortunately you'll have to be early or you'll not get a table. I could hear them turning down pickup orders about an hour before closing because that have such limited capacity to fill orders. Plan on being early and/or on waiting, and it will be a good meal."}
{"text":"The place is kind of small but very lovely and the ladies there are super sweet. Excellent service and great food!"}
{"text":"I went here a few months back and meant to post a review because this place really deserves one. Really good food cooked home style. The place is probably the smallest restaurant I've ever been to - seats about 10 people total. It feels like your long-lost Korean mom is making you dinner in her kitchen. The ambience is darling, the cook is fabulous and totally endearing, and the food is really good. I wouldn't say it was the best bulgogi I've ever had, but it was very tasty. The mandu was really delicious, and I highly recommend them. Take a drive out to Cecil PA just to try this place. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Perfection. The most delicious Korean food in Pittsburgh and its suburbs. I love the food. It's well done. I particularly enjoy bibimbap. BYOB makes this a happy hour hot spot. I would definitely recommend, and hope to go again soon."}
{"text":"After randomly finding a review for the Golden Pig online my girlfriend and I decided to check it out since it sounded incredible and was only about 20 minutes away.  The Golden Pig is a Korean restaurant tucked away in a small town called Cecil, PA and is owned and operated by one incredibly nice woman.  I wasn't sure what to expect until I opened the door and was greeted by Yong and sat down at a \"bar\" area that overlooked her small kitchen. The seating is limited and I think she likes it that way. Everything is literally made to order and most orders are called in, whereupon Yong gives you a time frame (depending on the queue) and you pick your food up accordingly. We decided to dine in and sat at the bar and talked to Yong while she prepared our meal and while we ate. She's incredibly personable and truly has captured something special in such an unassuming place. I had short ribs and my girlfriend had the vegetarian ramen, both were of course great. Along with our food she cooked a few side items and had us try them and everything was delicious. Eating at the Golden Pig is like having your mom cook you a warm, tasty, and healthy meal.  We will DEFINITELY be frequenting the Golden Pig in the future, the food and the atmosphere is fantastic and is a diamond in the rough for the area.  If you're reading this, take a drive over to the Golden Pig or order some food for takeout, through our conversation with Young we found out that she had just opened the restaurant two months prior and is already getting a nice customer base through word of mouth."}
{"text":"I've had take out from here a few times and always found the food acceptable. This time, for the first time, I ordered the bolgogi! It was exceptional and probably the only thing I will order from there in the future. It was that good! The only criticism I could give is that they don't really give you enough rice. You get a portion with your meal which comes in one container. I'm used to getting a separate carton of rice when getting Asian takeout."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Golden Pig because it was recommended to us by some friends multiple times. Upon first entering, you can tell you're going to get an authentic, home made meal. It's just the husband and wife who are there doing everything, which was incredibly impressive and admirable. You can tell they really enjoy cooking for people, and they're also so incredibly kind. Many people came in and out of the restaurant who were good friends with the owners, and seeing their interactions were so sweet.  As many other reviews have probably mentioned, the restaurant is extremely small. Definitely try and go at an off time in order to get a seat. You'll also find that a lot of people put in to-go or pick up orders, so even if there aren't many other people dining in, your food could still take a little longer than expected. However, our food still got out to us pretty fast! No complaints. The meal also starts off with a small plate of kimchi, pickled radish, broccoli with some type of sauce, and Korean coleslaw so you can snack on it if your food takes a bit of time! They were all so yummy- I ate half while waiting for my food and half with the appetizers and my entree.  For food we ordered the Fried Potatoes, Egg Soup, and the Korean Pancake with Veggies and Hot Pepper as appetizers. The Potatoes were nothing to shake a stick at. The egg soup was good, but it was better when we added the hot sauce to it. The best part of the soup were the giant chunks of egg in it! The pancake was incredible- would definitely get again, maybe next time with kimchi.   For our entrees, I got the Sautéed Tofu and Veggies. It wasn't overly flavorful, but I did really love how they prepared the tofu (pan fried as opposed to fried in a fryer like most places). It was pretty garlicky which I really liked, and the veggies were bright and perfectly cooked. My mom and sister got the Sautéed Shrimp and neither one of them was crazy about it- overall not super flavorful. They preferred mine. My dad got the Kalbi, and while it wasn't what he expected, he thought it was excellent. We also shared a Veggie Fried Rice, which was good but not as amazing as the people in the restaurant told us as they were leaving. It was good paired with our entrees, but I don't think I would've enjoyed it alone.  Overall this restaurant was great! Definitely an experience and some of the best (and maybe only) Korean food you'll find in the area."}
{"text":"Very nice family style authentic Korean restaurant. Food is authentic and decent. There are not many options on the menu. The dining space is extremely small."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was very satisfied with the meal. Ordered egg drop soup and bulgogi  which came with steamed rice. Soup was full of veggies and eggs with enough broth to still be a soup some spice but nothing hard to swallow. Kimchi salad was excellent and traditional as far as I know. Bulgogi was tender and marinated well stir fried with stalks and onions. Topped with sesame seeds and couldn't be any better. All for $13! If you are near the area stop by for authentic Korean food.   Only issue was the owner was the only person there working so during lunchtime it was difficult to get in and out, but I suppose that's the price you pay for homemade Asian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Finding good Korean food in Southwestern PA is not a simple task, but rest assured that Cecil, PA is home to a true gem.  Housed in a small location, the restaurant does offer an intimate setting for those lucky enough to find a seat.  Showing up early to ensure a seat is certainly recommended. For those who prefer the take-out option, Golden Pig certainly doesn't disappoint.  My personal favorite items on the menu are the Daeji Bulgogi and the Buldak-Chicken dishes.  A unique item on the menu that comes highly recommended would also be the Korean Pancake with Kimchi.  For those new to Korean food, please bare in mind there is a slight spice that accompanies most selections.  The Kimchi Fried Rice is certainly an option for those shying away from the spicier options.   A great location with delicious food and a very friendly proprietor."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean restaurant ever!  The owner and chef is delightful and kind.  I think I have tried every dish on the menu and they are all delicious."}
{"text":"The Golden Pig is one of my favorite places around, and is well worth the drive from the city, as long as you're prepared ton possibly have to take it to-go as they have very limited seating. I work nearby and eat here very often. The Buldak chicken is my favorite item on the menu. For lunch, you get a decent portion with kimchi coleslaw and white rice on the side that's very filling, especially considering it's eight bucks. The dinner portion is huge, and only three dollars more. The Jap Chae is another favorite, with a lot of flavor packed into the glass noodles and a good amount of vegetables mixed in. I also recommend their kimbap (like sushi). The owners are there every day and are very friendly. It's easy to get into a habit of eating here - I can't get tired of it!"}
{"text":"Family members have been here and I've driven by it many times, yet tonight was the first time I dined here. Two of us split the potato Korean pancake. Yum. I had the Bulgogi which was incredibly tender marinated beef and my friend had Man-Du. We both departed with leftovers.  We will be back. And yes, it is tiny. A party of six came in and left when they saw the place was half full. I don't think I would go there with more than two other friends."}
{"text":"WOW I have lived down the road from this place since well before it ever existed and today was the first day I have ever been there.  Everything there was amazing the service the food and the fact that it was BYOB.  I had the veg. pancake, ramen soup, and a pork dish that I can not remeber the name of that the owner recommended to me and there is no way it could have been better."}
{"text":"wonderfull ,tasty,almost like in Korea ,reasonably priced .I would vist and recommend any time to anybody"}
{"text":"Best Korean in Pittsburgh area. The food is NOT \"americanized\", it's pretty authentic. We've had about half the menu items and have never been disapointed. Well worth the trip from the city if you are craving the real deal...just don't get dressed up...it barely squeezes in four tables for four and a counter seating area...it is a jeans and t-shirt kind of place."}
{"text":"5 stars because we were already planning our next trip before we finished eating our meal.  Who would think the best Korean place in Pittsburgh would be way out in Cecil?  This might be the teeniest place ever but wow is it big on taste!   We went at 2pm on a Monday so even though it was tiny (only seats about 11 people total) and I'm sure it gets packed, there were only 2 other (very friendly) people in there that were finishing up and leaving.  It seems like they have a lot of regulars.  The owners (?) behind the counter taking our order and cooking were very nice.  Down low on the food:  the Korean pancake was ginormous and so good.  We got the vegetable but added some hot pepper too and then mixed the 2 sauces (chili paste&something else) at the table to dip it in and it added just the right amount of heat and extra flavor.  Also ordered the bulgogi and for some reason on the hottest day of the year my sister wanted the spicy mackerel tofu soup. He warned us when ordering it was fishy (which we expected and it was) but it also was chock full of other goodies like tofu and kimchi and super flavorful.  The banchan they serve with your order was awesome!  High five to the lady I was talking to at the Korean food bazaar that turned me on to this place :-) can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"It took me way too long to discover this little gem of a restaurant, but now that I have, I'll be going back regularly. Doug found it, actually, while looking through Yelp reviews, so we both owe a big thanks to the other Yelpers out there for your guidance.  The first thing I noticed about this place was how clean it is...absolutely spotless, which warms the heart of an ex-restaurant worker such as myself. There are two tables which both seat 3, and four seats along the bar. It was quiet when we arrived, and that was nice, as it gave us an opportunity to chat with the woman who was waiting tables and helping out in the kitchen. She was helpful and friendly, as was Yong Kwon, the owner, who works wonders in that tiny kitchen of hers. We started with the Korean pancake, which we ordered with potato...she asked if we wanted more veggies, and we said yes. This pancake was delicious...crispy and a little brown on the outside and creamy within, with plenty of vegetables inside. This pancake comes with the cole slaw and pickles, kim chee and sweet potatoes that had been marinated in soy, garlic and maple syrup then roasted in the oven. Everything was perfect; I especially appreciate that the sides came to the table room temperature and not straight from the fridge. Things taste so much better when they're the right temp, and the chef knows this. We went for the Daiji Bulgogi, marinated sliced pork that's served in a rich chile sauce that's slightly sweetened and garlicky, and the Buldak, a chicken dish that featured chicken thigh pieces in a very spicy chile sauce. Both dishes were spicy, with the pork dish having a greater variety of flavorings in it that balanced nicely between sweet, spicy and garlicky. The chicken dish was more a one note sauce, and tasted pretty much of straight chiles. I've had sauces like this in Mexico...dried red chiles pureed and mixed with very little else... and I love them. Both dishes were superb. I'll warn you here...you had better like spicy food if you're going to eat here. I understand some dishes here pack less heat than others, and I'm sure I'll discover which ones as I make my way through this menu. Yong runs the kitchen alone, so call ahead if you're in a hurry. My future plans are to go when it's slow and have a leisurely time of it, as we did last night. Yong is very friendly and obviously enjoys her customers, so you really do feel like you're in her home. Lovely place, lovely woman, and great food."}
{"text":"Nice mom and pop restaurant. VERY good if you live I the neighborhood. Not a place I'd busy my butt to go to."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time at this place. The owner/chef is a very sweet hardworking lady who will feel like your mom when she's cooking in the kitchen in front of you.   The food was authentic and fantastic. There are only 11 seats total in this place so get there early!   They have a regular soda selection along with 4 to 5 imported non alcoholic drinks (sweet rice, plum, & ginseng are some of the flavors I can recall)  Had the bugolgi, kimchi pancake & mandu. All were fantastic!   I selfishly don't want this place to move or get bigger so it always feels so exclusive and special."}
{"text":"There are folks on here saying the Golden Pig is not as good as many Korean places... blah, blah... try the coastal cities..,etc.   I know that everyone is going to have their own opinion and there are going to be regional flavor differences.  However, I've had the opportunity to enjoy Korean food in LA, Seattle, NYC, San Diego, Atlanta, near several Army bases across the U.S. and myriad Midwest restaurants, and I tell you that this place is as good as any place I've ever been.   I'm not kidding. When I say \"any\" place, I'm including the home I was raised in. The home where I spent my youth getting spoiled by a grandmother and aunts who grew up learning to cook... in a Korean kitchen... In Korea.   Don't let the experienced foodies with the exquisitely sophisticated palates turn you away from this little place.  If you want \"Americanized\" Asian food, there are dozens of places you can go and get that, but if you want REAL, home-cooked Korean food, this place is a winner.    I plan to eat here every time I come to town."}
{"text":"This place is tiny but the food is good if you are craving Korean and don't want to drive far. There's not a lot of room to sit inside, but on a nice day it would be great to sit outside. The pancake is a must! Don't be expecting the little dishes that you usually get at Korean restaurants. The bulgogi is a little more runny than I would like but then again, it's close by so it'll suffice."}
{"text":"Delicious Korean Food that is authentic, home cooked, and reasonably priced.  This place is out of the way for me, but well worth the trip.  It's a tiny place with a limited number of tables and seats about 12.  They do a considerable amount of take-out business, too.  The first thing you notice is that everyone is happy and well fed.  The owner is funny and very welcoming.  She explained that she prepares everything from scratch, and that her food is based on Southern Korean Cuisine.  We had the Jop-Cha and Buldak, but I want to hurry back and try the Man-Du, which is apparently very popular.  Along with your order, they bring 3 appetizers to your table, all very unique and tasty.  If you like to eavesdrop, you can hear every conversation in the room.  But everyone seems to be having a great time and they are enjoying the food."}
{"text":"Though a little far out of the city, great place to go for Korean food. Expect home-style cooking. When I went, I ordered Daeji Bulgogi which is essentially slices of marinated pork over rice. The beef was pretty good, perfectly marinated, and quite spicy as I liked it (preference). I also appreciated the larger portions that I was given (in comparison to other Korean joints that I've been to, where the amount of meat given was less than satisfying). The Kimchi pancake also ended up being pretty good ... not too oily but definitely most filling and you could actually taste the kimchi in it, which meant that that the amount of starch used was not excessive. Will be back ... I look forward to trying other dishes."}
{"text":"Extraordinary. Can't say enough amazing things about Ms Kwan and her spicy squid. I would crawl on hand and knee for her spicy kimchi soup. Near perfection."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great price.  Loved it.  Can't wait to go back for some gimbap."}
{"text":"We came for lunch.  The atmosphere is very home-y, and everyone is friendly.   P. S. Get the meat kimbap. It is. AMAZING. Yeah I kind of ate the entire plate of it... Whoops  Their bulgolgi is on the less side for full of flavor, but it was still good.   A home cooked Korean meal in Pittsburgh? Can't get it anywhere else"}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Service was very slow though. They only have 11 seats max. A very, very tiny store but food was what you call \"homecook\". If you are up to try some decent somewhat authentic home cook Korean food, this will be it!"}
{"text":"Brought the parents here for dinner since mom loves Korean food. This restaurant is incredibly charming - only a few tables & bar seating inside, with cute pig toys & trinkets decorating every wall & corner of the interior. The service is very friendly - only a man & a woman working when we walked in, but they quickly prepared a table for us and made us feel at home.   Between our group, we split: Mixed Vegetable Pancake, Beef Bulgogi, Japchae, and Beef Fried Rice. They also served us some small dishes of pickled radishes, kimchi, woodear, and marinated cabbage. The pancake was a great - crispy with lots of veggies. The beef in the fried rice & bulgogi had amazing flavor and the japchae was also super tasty and looked beautiful.   They also had a giant pineapple cake that appeared to have been just baked and were offering it to all of the customers. Although we were pretty stuffed, we made room for the cake :D It's not the quickest place to sit down and have a meal, since they only have 1 server & 1 cook, but everything is well worth the wait. If you're in a hurry, I believe they also do takeout though!"}
{"text":"I imagine going to the Golden Pig as what it would be like to eat at my Korean mother in law's (if I had one) house.  Very limited seating and they fill up fast but definitely worth the wait! I wasn't a fine of the squid salad, but everything else I've had has been fantastic.  They also have an assortment of imported drinks.   Tip: don't come in here or order food within 45 of closing, they just get to busy."}
{"text":"Ordered kimchi pancakes and kalbi, both were good.  The kalbi was made really well, very tender and great flavor.  It was definately not chewy or over seasoned.    Good service."}
{"text":"I spent a year in Korea about twenty years ago and have not been able to find the spicy delicious meals that I had there... Until now! Ms. Kwon cooks authentic from scratch homemade meals that are incredible. The Raman is spicy and filling, loaded with fresh vegetable and plenty of heat! The fried rice is made to order and is packed with fresh veggies and comes with a side of cabbage and spicy radish. We ordered a small container of the kimchi that was so good, it didn't make it home!  The place is small but comfortable, plenty of parking  The owner and only employee that we saw, ms.kwon was kind and engaging. She helped me polish up on my Korean which after twenty years was a bit rusty."}
{"text":"So I've lived in Cecil most of my life and finally stopped here to eat.  Wow - what a pleasant surprise!    I started off with the spicy ramen and once my wife got a taste of it we ended up splitting it.  It had a nice kick but still had a bunch of complex flavors going on - the heat doesn't overpower you.  For my meal I mistakenly ordered just the pork fried rice.  I misunderstood the menu - it normally comes with beef, chicken, and pork but I thought I had to choose.  No matter...it was still excellent.  My wife got the Dak Bo Kum which is essentially chicken with veggies and a side of rice.  It also had a very unique flavor to it that we both loved.    What really made the trip enjoyable were the owners.  They were both so kind and you could tell the genuinely cared about how our food tasted - not something you get to experience very often.    We will definitely be going back here a bunch!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely a hole in the wall type of place, more like a house built in the middle of nowhere. The owner single-handily full-fills all the positions in the restaurant. I gotta admit, the service can be slow, but pretty darn good when all 4 positions are held by the same person. She's the hostess, waitress, chef, and owner. She puts on the show right in front of you, and often throws a joke here and there for entertainment. This is the most authentic Korean restaurant in Pittsburgh, thank goodness I found this place, or my Korean food cravings would never be put to rest. The food is fresh and extremely flavorful. I highly recommend the kimchi or vegeatable pancake, add some of their hot sauce, and you have heaven in your mouth.  Their Jap Chae is perfectly made, very flavorful. I love food with a lot of flavor, on the salty side, so if you like the lightly flavored foods, you may need to ask the chef to tone down on the salt/soysauce.   Portions are good, price is fairly cheap for Korean food in Pittsburgh.  Warning: Place is tiny. There're only 3 small tables and a mini bar inside so come early (before 6:30pm) if you want seats. There's a table outside that's good for 5 or 6. But let's face it, with Pittsburgh weather, you really can only dine at the table during summer. It's too cold to eat outside in the winter, fall, and even spring. This place is not good for parties of 4 or more. I recommend you order to go."}
{"text":"I made the trek here from Shadyside to quell a hankering for some real Korean food and was a little disappointed. (I suppose I have been spoiled with LA's K-town and its delicious little holes-in-the-wall on every block.) The bulgogi was so-so and my friend's ramen came out of a package--then again, why someone would order ramen at a Korean restaurant? Great mandu, though.   But I have to admit, the tiny place is almost too cute. Come at a dead hour, say 3pm, sit at the bar and chat with Young as she puts together your lunch. It may not be the best lunch you've ever had, nor the cheapest, but you'll feel like it was made with love. And that's more than enough."}
{"text":"So you know those places that you'd never just come across?  And even if you did, you probably wouldn't go inside if someone didn't tell you to?  That's this place and it's a total find.  It's tiny -- and I mean tiny.  3 little tables and maybe 5 seats at the bar.  That's it.  The whole place can't be more than a few hundred square feet.  They cook everything to order and warn you when you come in that it might be a while before you eat.   It's well worth the wait.     We started with the little complimentary sampling dish - not even sure what it was, but I liked it.   We then got a the kimchi pancake and the mandu - both were delicious and flavorful.  An order of the beef bulgogi and a sample of the gim bap that my boyfriend ordered topped off the meal.   Everything was simply delightful and seemed very authentic.   It went well with the bottle of wine I brought in with me.  You can see them cooking it all order and they talk to the guests while they do it.     Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this place and would absolutely trek out to Cecil to try it again."}
{"text":"I read others talk about this being a \"tiny\" place and was assuming it would be small. It's smaller than small. It's about the size of the last 4 rows of a school bus. You cannot have a table for 4 here. There are two tables total that might squeeze 3, plus maybe 4-5 seats at a counter. That being said, the woman who runs this literally does everything! That's both good and bad. The bad is that she's swamped between taking orders, cooking, answering the phone, and who knows how cleanup and dishwashing is done.... It's like someone's mom in a small kitchen with limited supplies. But she gets it done!! Amazing.   The food is ok, not great. Considering its in Cecil maybe I should say it's great. But frankly I was hoping for something better. I love Korean food and have been spoiled by some awesome Korean places, regrettably none in Pittsburgh. The Korean pancake was a huge starter and even though we ordered it with hot peppers it was a little bland. My Buldak Chicken was listed on the menu as fiery and  \"not for the faint of heart\" but It was probably only a 6 on the heat scale but fairly tasty. My wife's Daeji bulgogi looked almost identical despite being a pork dish. The color was indeed, as someone else pointed out, like that of fiery Cheetos. Somewhat off putting. Must be the same sauce cause the dishes tasted almost the same.   All in all, pretty good food and very reasonably priced. Not worth the drive for me. Also not a place I'd want to wait to get into. Go off peak or call for takeout."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place; love the intimacy, love the personality, love the owner and the obvious respect and love for the ingredients and food. Delicious."}
{"text":"Oh I love Korean food! I was so excited and surprised to find such a well-reviewed Korean restaurant in Cecil!  The shop is TINY. There are seriously two tables and a bar that seats another 4 people maybe. I'd probably just take out next time. We walked in and weren't recognized by anyone for a good 10 minutes. When my husband asked if we should wait and if someone would take our order (we seriously didn't know how it worked) we were kinda dismissed - but I honestly think it might have been a slight language barrier. What he said came across as dismissive but I truly don't think he meant it that way.   The service got much better as we went on. They were clearly swamped with take out orders. My husband and I shared the veggie pancake and I ordered the jap chae. The food was fresh and very authentic. They have a good variety and I will definitely come back and try more! Just probably take out next time."}
{"text":"Food was decent. The quantity was way less though. We ordered the Pork and Kimchi Fried Rice ($9.95), Mandu -5 ($8.95), kimchi pancake ($7.95). We took the food to go and while checking out there seemed to be a mandatory tipping option. This brought our total to $35. This, for a meal for 2 people, for the quantity of food provided, I thought was very expensive for a takeout restaurant. I would not visit again. I don't understand all the good reviews out here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, my dad and I go to lunch here every chance we get. Absolutely wonderful food, great flavor, and the owner is such a wonderful person to talk to!"}
{"text":"Small place, short menu, excellent food.  Unexpected to see a Korean place in the small town of Cecil, but  very great to have."}
{"text":"Was visiting my BF in Smithton and wasn't feeling well, so I wanted to get some kimchijigae and turned to Yelp for suggestions. So happy to have found this place. One of the newspaper articles in the restaurant describes the owner as a one woman show and that is absolutely true. Especially with the intimate setup, it's like walking into a Korean mom's kitchen. We were there at 2pm on a Saturday and the place was full (only seats about 10) and service was really slow, because like I said, it's a one woman show. She was doing everything from taking orders & payment, food prep, cooking, and waiting. However, the food made the wait absolutely worth it. It took about 40 minutes to be served, but the mackerel kimchi stew, fried mandu (dumplings) and kimchi & pork fried rice were all so delicious. There was a generous portion of mackerel in the stew, the mandu was perfectly crispy, and the fried rice was really yummy and a huge portion. It's honestly better than the Korean food I've had in KTown LA, KTown NYC and Annandale, VA. I was so surprised with it being the middle of nowhere PA. Ms. Kwon repeatedly thanked us for our patience and checked in on us multiple times. Even though the food was really slow to come out, I would still absolutely recommend this hole in the wall."}
{"text":"I feel like this food is more genuine (less Americanized) and truly what one would find coming out of someone's home kitchen maybe in Seoul or another region. While I can't claim to have experienced Korea, I've worked in Los Angeles for years and frequented restaurants in Koreatown many, many times. The quality, taste and care going into the food is wonderful and I've never had a bad meal.   They also have some great vegetarian and vegan options for those customers as well.   Only complaint I have is how many people come from downtown to eat at my little spot 15 miles outside the city!!! :)  To address a couple of the lower ratings below... Maybe go find a Korean Applebees or get yourself some Giant Eagle sushi and you'll be happy. It also takes real courage to stand your ground for water ;)   For the average American diner, this is going to be a new flavor palate for you, so be ready! This isn't a Korean PF Changs."}
{"text":"decent korean food, not the best we've had, but simple, flavorful, and traditional.    the other reviews paint the picture of the atmosphere - simple, small, no frills or fuss, and VERY small. there's no way you'd be able to get a party of four to sit together. two or three would be manageable if there are open seats.   the two-person team is as warm and welcoming as the aroma and flavors of the food. we had kimchi pancake (our favorite), daiji (pork) bulgogi, and buldak chicken (spicy chicken).  the kimchi pancake was warm, soft, and comforting.  the main dishes were spicy, but tolerable. the texture of sauces was more grainy than what I've had at other Korean restaurants, but still delicious.    a reasonable $37 for all three dishes, 3 bottles of water, and two \"Korean drinks.\" we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"There has been so much written about this place I'm not sure what to add. The food is wonderful and the owner makes you feel like you're part of her family. The downside is that there are only about 8 seats in the entire restaurant. Not 8 tables, 8 seats. Still, it's well worth the effort. The experience is so much more than the food, which I can't say enough good things about. Weeknights might improve your odds of getting a table."}
{"text":"Freaking awesome Korean place in the middle of nowhere. The Golden Pig is so great that we travel over an hour to get there just to sit outside as they only have two, yes that's right two tables. It is imperative that one get there before 7 as they often shut down early. Just get there early and be prepared to eat outside or get takeout. The food is so killer that one puts up with the lack of seats."}
{"text":"Well this was unexpected, finding such great Korean food in Cecil!  I had a friend rave to me about this place, so the other day on my way home from work I figured I'd try some takeout. The restaurant itself is quite small and quaint (as other reviews have mentioned). My brief interaction with the man and woman working there left me with a very positive impression. Very very friendly and outgoing. Other reviews lead me to believe these are the owners.   Now, for the food. I ordered a pretty simple order since I'm new to Korean food - Beef Bulgogi with steamed rice and kimchi. The beef tasted wonderful with a great sweet/savory blend. This was the first kimchi I've had and I think I'm hooked. A bit of spice, not over the top and not a \"why bother\" amount. Even the steamed rice had a sweetness to it I'd almost compare to sushi rice. I loved everything about it.    Cost is what I'd expect for something that's quite obviously homemade. My meal was $13.xx total and it filled me up (idk what size meals another review was expecting...). I'm definitely going to go back soon, and branch out to try other meals!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and the chef makes you feel right at home! Intimate dining area. I recommend the man-du and bulgogi. We will be coming back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious kimchi. Bulgogi was great and I recommend the Korean pancake. Thank you Yelpers for a great find."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful little restaurant. The place has less than 15 seats inside and a couple outdoor tables. We started with the Mandu dumplings w spicy coleslaw and a spicy dipping sauce and a Korean pancake with hot peppers. For the entrees we ordered beef bulgogi with white rice and daeji bulgogi with white rice. Everything was fresh and delicious. Food takes about 15-20 minutes. The husband and wife are friendly and I would highly recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"The best. Tiny hidden gem known to most locals! Authentic Korean food served with a side of korean attitude. Love their food and service :) a favorite of my family's!"}
{"text":"I kept hearing about the hype about how this was the most authentic and best Korean food in the area (some claim in southwestern PA??) and finally decided to make the drive out here from the city. Unfortunately, this dining experience probably gave me the largest ever deviation between expectation and result.  I'll cut straight to it--the food is not my type. Eat at an acclaimed Korean restaurant on the coasts, or if you're in the suburbs just make the reverse drive that I did into the city and go to a place like Korea Garden or Nak Won Garden. They're not mind-blowing, but I assure you they're much closer to what you'll find in NY or LA than Golden Pig is. We got the ramen to start--okay, we weren't expecting instant ramen, but fine it was $5 and somewhat hearty. As we waited for entrees, we never got our banchan, and no one came by to check on us or at least give us some water (for the record, other customers got the side dishes at the beginning, without asking).   When the entrees came, we asked the guy (not the couple who owns the place) and he was somewhat apologetic for forgetting. The banchan consisted of a small plate with two pieces of random things like kimchi, potato, and broccoli (??). It wasn't amazing, but the biggest surprise was that each of us got one such plate. Go to any other authentic Korean place, and a table would get one portion of each side separately. Yes, it's the same food in the end, but the implication is entirely different--these sides are meant to be shared among the people dining together, and preparing them on separate plates individualized for each person signifies a huge shift in the dining experience. I understand that they might be trying to accommodate for customers who don't regularly eat this kind of food. At a certain level, both patron and restaurant have to adapt to different customs (and that's a good thing for intercultural mixing), but I felt that the owners went too far in this instance.  For the entrees, we got the daeji bulgogi and buldak, both of which were rather mediocre. They weren't terrible, but I've had better at the aforementioned places in Pittsburgh. The two main issues were that 1) there was too much sauce on both plates, and 2) there were few other seasonings or flavors. For 1), it appears from the Yelp pics for this place that they're not very consistent--some appear drenched in sauce, while others actually look appetizing. We got the former, and that probably led to 2); the only taste was spicy, and while there were some onion and carrot pieces their taste was basically overwhelmed by the sauce. Other than that, the sesame was probably a bit overdone, and some scallion would probably have helped a lot.  Despite all this though, I'm genuinely happy that this couple has made it this far. It's not always easy working such long hours as an immigrant family, but evidently they're making a lot of people happy. They've also put in a lot of work making the restaurant welcome to everyone (try to count how many pigs are inside if you go), so I hope they thrive as long as there are happy customers."}
{"text":"As good as the other reviews say: authentic (I'm asian), high-quality dishes. I had the ramen and kalbi; both very good, the kalbi was excellent as 2 med-rare, tender steaks. Hubby had the spiicy ramen (generous portion), and sauteed shrimp entree; both great, with the latter having at least 7 of the largest shrimp we've seen served, even at more \"snobby\" restaurants, for a reasonable price. Ms. Kwon is a dynamo; we'll return!  (just ensure you up for the wait for calling in a take-out, or esp. for eating in)"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable meal with the family.  The Korean mixed vegetable pancake (spicy) was very tasty with chunks of jalapeño peppers. Korean coleslaw with chile peppers was cool and spicy at the same time.  Ramen was very tasty.  Chicken flavor with lots of egg bits and noodles.  My daughter ordered spicy noodles, which while spicy were too sweet for my taste.  Story fry chicken with vegetables was extremely fresh.  Spicy pork was wonderful with distinct Korean flavors.  Next time I want to try the spicy squid."}
{"text":"I've been going there since it opened. Have had just about everything on the menu by now. Always first rate."}
{"text":"This is what dining is meant to be. A comfortable home style atmosphere, with food that is beyond exceptional. She's truly an artisan, and employs skills that have been passed down from her mother. I would trade every chain in the city of Pittsburgh, for 2-3 more restaurants with the pneuma that exists here. Unfortunately, It would be nearly impossible to recreate that magic, especially in a world of Edison light bulbs and overrated food."}
{"text":"This is such a cute place! I went there last night with my BFF, and brought a bottle of wine as it is BYOB. It is a cute quaint place. I read that it was small, but I didn't realize how small! It was a very intimate environment. We got there at the perfect time and got a seat right away, however 2 couples came in shortly after us had to wait until we were done...it was a beautiful day so I don't think they minded. We split the Korean Pancake and Mandu for appetizers and the Bulgogi and the Vegetable Jop-Chae as entrees. Everything was flavored perfectly. This is true authentic Korean cuisine! I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"By far the best Korean food in the city. After living in Korea for years, I missed the food. I've tried other places but generally have been disappointed.   The Golden Pig is my go to place. Although it's small and often need to wait, it's worth it.   Her kimchi is amazing! I always start with a side of kimchi and a pancake (usually kimichi). My two favorite dishes here are the doenjang-jjigae (tofu soup) and the daeji bulgogi (spicy pork).   It's a little out of the way but that shouldn't stop you from trying this cute little BYOB spot. It's also cool to see the community really support this place."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't come here for my first taste of Korean food cause it will make other places look like North Korea. I'm pretty sure the place can only seat like 10 people. It is in the middle of nowhere and pretty easy to miss if you aren't looking for it. The cook is a sweet lady who is concerned about your food preferences. With out even asking she wanted to know if i was vegan, didn't eat pork, or was avoiding red meat. That was a first for me at any restaurant.  Delicious bulgogi, awesome kimchi, great potato pancakes. Small place but feels extremely homey. The price is reasonable and worth the flavor and experience. Kim Jong Un should make a trip here.   I will come back again for that Bulgogi."}
{"text":"AWESOME IN EVERY SINGLE WAY, and, so very AUTHENTIC and we will make the drive many more times. LOVE the owner who is not only the best chef but has a personality to match. What a NICE LADY! We loved the food and cannot wait to return. Bulgoki was awesome pancake!!! WOW for the food go go fo for sure!~"}
{"text":"I ate here in fall. This was the best Korean food I have ever had. It was absolutely the best. Nice homey feel as well. Very small and very personal. She really cares about her food and making it authentic.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was really good as I was expecting it to be. The decor was cute, little ceramic pigs everywhere. The owner was very nice. I enjoyed trying the Korean drinks they had in the fridge, there was a delicious cinnamon punch. I had the buldak chicken, it was sooo good. Very authentic. I will definitely be going back to try more things."}
{"text":"Fantastic Korean food in Cecil! Feels like you are in your grandma's kitchen. Just be aware there is limited seating."}
{"text":"It's like visiting your Korean mom for lunch."}
{"text":"The owner does it all and is very good!  I usually get Korean ribs, fried rice, and fried potatoes. Seating area very small. Just order take out."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall but the food is very authentic, home-feel and delicious. The owner (chef) and her assistant are the only two that cook, serve and clean.  My family have been here quite a few times. Everything is good here. The wait can be long at times but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience ! If you like Korean food, don't miss this place. If you're looking for a candlelit romantic atmosphere, better get takeout and get your candles elsewhere. But this is the real deal for Korean cuisine!"}
{"text":"I've been to a TON of Korean restaurants in my time and will say this place is not as good as folks say. First, size DOES matter... This place is so small that it is uncomfortable. Seriously. I have never dined in a public place this tiny and dirty. I assume that because this business is shoehorned in a cinder block bunker there is no place to store cleaning agents but in full sight of customers. I was literally rubbing elbows with some stranger and neither one us was happy about it... Second, don't bother asking for water unless you want to pay for bottled. I needed to take a prescription pill and was lectured about how they don't have glasses for water. Seriously? I stood my ground and was brought room temperature tap water in a styrofoam cup. Nice. Onto the food. I had the kimchi pancakes. They were what one would expect. I then ordered gimbop. It was average. We also shared a vegetable fried rice. It  was average. I asked for hot sauce and the owner flipped out on me. Informed me that hot sauce will ruin the dish...thanks for the lecture, but I like my food spicy and I'm paying for it...so...give me hot sauce sans lecture. To drive 40 minutes from the city to get jammed into this ugly space to eat average Korean is not my idea of a culinary experience. I suppose if my car breaks down in Cecil I might be back to the Golden Pig. Otherwise, there are better options."}
{"text":"Homemade Korean food cooked by your Halmony. What could be better than that!! This place is really small so if you are at all claustrophobic just wait until warm weather when you can eat al fresco. Excellent meal."}
{"text":"Wonderful gem. The owner and wife are very cordial. The ingredients are fresh.  I ordered Spicy Noodle Salad which was wonderful but big enough for an entree. I had daiji bulgogi.  Very nice. The restaurant is not crowded at 4pm Wednesday!"}
{"text":"Great one woman operation.  It's like you've been invited over to her house and she's making you her mom's Korean dishes.  It can be busy and the wait can be really long but she tries really hard and the food is really delicious.  I wish she would get a bigger place and a little help so I wouldn't feel the pressure of her having to juggle phone orders, table service and cooking.  Sometimes she looks a little harried.  I love her pancakes a lot.  The pork bulgogi is really fabulous.  The kimchi was a little salty last night and she could serve more dishes but all in all we are lucky to have her here to make us authentic Korean food.  We've eaten there a few times now and always leave happy."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's like if your mother was Korean and she was cooking for you. A local treasure."}
{"text":"It took me way, WAY too long to get back here.  Brought family from out of state.  Everyone was beyond satisfied.  We split a Korean pancake as an app.  Two in our party had the short ribs, one had the shrimp and I had the spicy squid.  You can't go wrong at the Golden Pig.  YUM."}
{"text":"I loved my meal here.  The owner is very sweet and made great recommendations.  If you love spicey food you will not be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Super authentic. Incredible flavor. Owner, server, greeter, Chef Yong is always delightful, funny and welcoming."}
{"text":"As authentic as you can get.  Sauce is not too sweet and is light.  Prices are very reasonable for a home cooked meal.  The bulgogi has fine slivers of beef in a light sauce reduction.  The beef is not smothered with sauce but rather complemented and the vegetables are cooked crunchy.  Portions are just right."}
{"text":"A very cute, VERY TINY hole-in-the-wall Korean joint.   Literally only 10 seats.   The woman who runs the entire thing is super sweet and friendly.  The food is authentic, very homey, and definitely hit the spot.  I ordered the buldak (\"fire\" chicken), my colleague ordered the spicy pork bulgogi, and we shared an order of mandoo (fried dumplings).  Everything was hot, well-seasoned, fiery, and filling--just like mom would make at home.  I kind of wish I could have tried one of her stews, but I'd JUST made kimchi jjigae the night before, and wasn't quite in the mood for dwenjang jjigae.    If this place were closer to Pittsburgh, I'd give this place 4 stars.  Driving out to Cecil from where I live, however, I can't say it was worth the 40 minute drive... but that's because I'm able cook everything on the menu.  When I go out to have Korean food, it's to save time, and driving over an hour round-trip doesn't achieve that for me, so I can't say I'll be back here, even though I enjoyed everything.  BUT if you're not familiar with Korean cooking and you live nearby here, then I would DEFINITELY say this is a great place to start.    And you don't necessarily have to be discouraged by the \"CLOSED\" sign.  Check to see if the lights are on inside the restaurant.  It's her way of controlling the demand. :)"}
{"text":"I knew Golden Pig was a small one woman operation and her leanings were home cooked Korean. I couldn't wait to try her food. The owner was very warm & welcoming and we were seated at one of 2 tables in the restaurant. There were also 2 other patrons seated at the bar that had 4 stools. It's a tiny operation. We ordered the Korean Pancake with Kimchi to start. My husband ordered the bul dak chicken that was described as fiery hot. I ordered the pork daeji bulgogi.   Our Korean Pancake arrived with 2 starter plates with some amazing Korean Coleslaw, Kimchi & other assorted veggies. I mixed all the starter goodies with my kimchi pancake & it worked. Without these enhancements the pancake wasn't nearly as exciting.   Both of our main dishes arrived with what appeared to be a similar sauce - the color of hot cheetos (that's literally off the Post Gazette review that hung above our table & he nailed it!). The sauces were nearly identical & I actually preferred it over my husband's chicken than my pork. Spice on a  1-10 scale was probably a 7 for the chicken & a 5 on the pork. That was about the only difference in the sauces that I could discern. It was definitely a home cooked style & pretty good.  If I lived close enough to frequent Golden Pig, I believe the owner's charming personality could woo me into a 4 star. She's quite fun and really brings her personality into her cooking. Realistically it's a 3.5 rating. Although I 100% get the plethora of 5 star ratings she's getting from regulars who adore her.   We are in love with Korean food & have tried some truly stellar places, sadly not in Pittsburgh. Not yet anyway."}
{"text":"Great Korean food!  Made right in front of you.  High standards (no substitutions at all!) and friendly owner/patrons!  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I frequent a Korean joint that I absolutely LOVE near home, so when other patrons there mentioned the Golden Pig I had to make a point to stop in.   Of course I'm comparing the 2 directly and this place was good but not nearly as good as Chongs. I ordered the exact same meal that I normally would: Bulgogi (marinated beef), veggie pancake & Bimbap (seaweed roll).  The layers of flavors are good and if you've never had Korean food you really should change that.  The thing I missed here were the dipping sauces and different textures between fresh and cooked veggies served along with the Bulgogi that I'm used to.  They clearly use the same seasonings but different cooking methods, the bulgogi seemed soft & soupy, as if it's prepared in a slow cooker. Flavor was good, just a really tender texture that I didn't expect.  Golden Pig is a bit pricey in comparison at $54 for lunch where I'd normally pay $28 for the same order at my local joint.  I don't think I'll return, however you should at least try it.  There are 2 tables and maybe 4 stools at the counter so be prepared to wait on a table or just order to go. One little Korean lady running the whole show,  so clean your own table, get your own drinks & silverware. Make yourself right at home."}
{"text":"It's like sitting in someone's kitchen -- and it's only about the size of one too. It's only the second time I've ever had Korean food and the first time I had to go to LA to get it. So my quick trip down the road to Cecil was not a disappointment.   First: the food. I got Mandu which is classic Korean dumplings served with rice. Mine had broccoli, carrot, cabbage & tofu in them. There were way too many to ever eat in one sitting. Especially because we started with Kimchi Pancakes and a little kimchi veggie salad.   Next: the environment. Golden Pig gets a lot of regulars. People kept coming into the store and going behind the counter to grab something to snack on or talk to the owner. Just as I was leaving a big rowdy group of guys came in and basically filled the restaurant. They started to pass around wine to all of us in the restaurant.   It was an experience unlike any other, for sure."}
{"text":"Limited menu often leads to unlimited taste.  A very cozy if not small place in the middle of nowhere outside of the 'Burgh.  I have been here twice and neither time disappointed.  As you may have read one woman runs it all, so it does take some time for some dishes and it can get a bit pricey since you'll want to try everything.  The spicy chicken is legit and my Korean mother-in-law makes a very good version.   Sometimes getting a seat is difficult, but you can do take-out. Also it's BYOB so bring a bottle of soju (traditional Korean liquor that can be had from the big Wines and Spirits) and offer her a shot.  She did shots with my friends and I on my first visit.  All the dishes I've tried have been exactly the way they're supposed to taste and they are fresh. Do yourself a favor and head out to Cecil for the best Korean meal in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This rating does not reflect a comparison between other cities' Korean food as this would not be an apples-to-apples comparison.  If you spent as much time as I did seeking out decent, non-Americanized Asian cuisine, you would understand. It would simply be unfair to judge a one-woman's home cooking operation to other large businesses in established Asian communities.  Simply put, she does a decent job in putting out a homey feel with food at reasonable prices.  Their condensed version of ban chan (small side items that accompanies the entree) come combined on one plate.  The handmade kimchi was outstanding and she also packages them in jars for sale.     Some of the items on the menu I had:  Korean pancake - the texture is consistent with what I expect and the optional hot peppers really add a delayed heat kick that I enjoyed.  Bulgogi- a stir fry of seasoned meat and veggies that comes with steamed rice.  Simple but hits the spot.  Short Rib - comes already deboned and tender.  The marinade on the soft, tender meat is a welcome change.  I would have liked it even more with grilled onions.    Mackerel tofu soup - large chunks of fish and spicy tofu soup.  The spines of the fish were super soft and can be eaten so no bones to worry about.    Verdict: best Korean outside the city on the south side of town."}
{"text":"Little, 3 tables and 5 or 6 seats at counter.  BYOB but crowded.  Food is made to order and made by women named Yong.  She is very friendly and funny. Talked to her while she cooked.  Food was amazing.  Spicy, tried the Korean kimchi pancakes and Bulgogi.  In Cecil a few miles off of I79. Korean cole slaw was crispy and spicy.  Has take out."}
{"text":"Best Korean food in Pittsburgh, bar none.  The owner is very friendly and helps you experiment with the entire menu.  The short ribs are amazing as well as the bulgogi.   The ramen noodles always hit the spot, not the same ones you make at home."}
{"text":"We recently discovered this place due to traveling for soccer.   It is now on my top 5 places to eat locally - really, everything on the menu is fresh, tasty and soooo good!   My favorites are the Kimchi and spicy pepper pancakes; bulgogi (ask for spicy!) and the mandu.    I've been here 4 or 5 times now and I never get tired of it.  The owner is a sweet Korean woman who is very nice and will do her best to make your experience wonderful.    The review from 12.14.15 (Alistair C.) is really over the top rude and ignorant;  he sounds like a whiny snot from the west coast that isn't happy with ANYTHING from Pittsburgh (left several other nasty local reviews) so maybe he can take his uppity self back to Seattle.    We LOVE Golden Pig and Mrs. Kwon - and more and more local people are discovering her delicious food."}
{"text":"So I didn't know what to expect from this place. It's in the middle of the suburbs and was touted as having the best Korean food. Umm, ok.  I walked in and it's TINY. Just a handful of seats,  so definitely not the place to bring a group of friends or family. But it's charming and the owner is such a warm and welcoming hostess. I glanced at the short menu, then made a few selections. I decided to have the spicy ramen there and ordered the bulgogi and tofu sautéed with kimchi and pork to go.  The ramen was ready quickly and is served with lots of tasty vegetables to add in. It was freaking delicious. The noodles were al dente and the broth couldn't have been more flavorful. The portion was definitely enough to be a meal...I actually took some home with me.  Once I got into my car, the smell of the other dishes completely overwhelmed my senses and I had to give it a try. Good grief this woman can cook!  You can tell that she really cares about every single dish she creates and puts her soul into the food.   I live in Regent Square and I have come to the conclusion that I will have to make regular trips out to Cecil to enjoy more of Ms. Kwon's fabulous food."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant anywhere in the world. Yong is a perfectionist and her food will blow you away. It seats 12 and is worth any wait. I crave the kimchi gigai and her spicy pancake is tasty! Beef galbi is the kids favorite!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Avoid weekends. Very small.  3 tables and small bar seating area. I love spicy. Order the Kimchee pancakes. Love the Pig."}
{"text":"Excellent all around. The place is tiny and it's basically a one-woman show. The food was terrific and you can tell the owner takes pride in what she serves. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing. It doesn't get fresher than this.  I give the mandu two thumbs up.   This restaurant only seats 10 -12 people. One lovely lady waits on you, cooks your food and delivers it.  It is a true dining experience. She brought us out some fresh cooked Korean vegetables. I love to try new foods.  Very small, but it is so quaint and warm inside. You feel comfortable immediately.  Take a chance and try this place....you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I can see why this place gets really good reviews--it's almost like going to a Korean house and having a nice, home cooked meal. The food is good; many of your standard Korean items are on the menu and the prices are reasonable. I got the impression that many of the folks who come here come here very frequently. Seating is very limited--I counted eleven chairs on the inside and a few on the outside for those brief months in Pittsburgh when this is a feasible eating arrangement. The bulgogi I had was solid."}
{"text":"The size of a shoebox, and during peak hours the place can look crowded...do not let this deter you; the food is worth the agoraphobia, and your patience will be rewarded with fresh, spicy, meals cooked while you watch.  Another restaurant that makes me say, \"in Cecil?!!!\"."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem.  At the end of Route 50, past the Original Farmer's Market the road narrows from 4 lanes to 2, a quarter of a mile on the left is the Golden Pig.  The building is easy to pass as it is shared with a barber and an equipment dealer. There is a small parking lot next to the building and one table for outside dining.  The Golden Pig reminds me of visiting a friend's family room.  Three high top tables and a bar are the only seating.  Each meal is individually prepared by the owner and absolutely delicious.  We enjoyed the pepper pancakes which are not at all like a breakfast pancake. Thin crisp cakes are served with a spicy red sauce that enhances the flavors.  Spicy noodle soup has an abundance of home made ramen noodles, filling and flavorful.  My husband enjoyed the beef bulgogi. This is a BYOB and many people stopped in for take out. Really excellent Korean food in an unlikely place of Cecil."}
{"text":"Shocking that this place has such high reviews.  Not worth the drive out and disgusting.  Do yourselves a favor and go to Green Pepper in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"I guess I came here with high expectations or came on an off day. We ordered the man du and daiji bulgogi. All were just ok, I can make better daiji bulgogi at home. Flavor-wise, Dasonii by the airport is much better with similar prices.  I would give this place only a 3 if it wasn't for the awesome experience though. Tiny restaurant, limited seating, grandmas-kitchen-feel. Like everyone says, the owner takes our order, cooks it fresh, and serves it herself.  Pro-tip: there is outdoor seating (picnic tables) in the back. Place your order inside and let the owner know your eating outside."}
{"text":"This is one of the most authentic experiences I've had when dining out.  It is basically walking into a version of Yong Kwon's kitchen.  The food is prepared especially for you, as she accommodates each level of spice to your liking and will modify the meal to your preference.  The food is extremely fresh.  This restaurant has never disappointed me.  If you want to try out an amazing, tasty Korean dishes, this hole in the wall is an absolute must!!"}
{"text":"While they do not need any more positive reviews, I will add this one to the mix to attempt to convince any of you on the fence to enjoy this treasure in Western PA.     First, come with a sense of adventure and love for everything fresh, homemade and absolutely stunning.  To some, Korean seems like something from another planet but it is simple, flavorful and often spice.  On this trip, my partner in crime and I shared a kimchi pancake, the beef bulgogi and a tofu and vegetables dish.    I will start with her kimchi.. house made and simple.  Absolutely stunning as is the entire pickle plate served with every meal.  Pickled cucumbers, daikon radishes, Korean slaw and kimchi.  The bulgogi is amazing if not different than what you might have had elsewhere.  The pancakes are stunning, the absolute best of any I have every experienced here in the States.   She pan fries hers to crispy, making them even more yummy.   It's tiny, six seats are the counter and three tables.  Most of her business is take out so I suggest planning a trip soon."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. The dining area only seats 10 people. The owner and chef has a very unique and dissident personality. Doesn't look like much from the outside but it's sure worth the visit."}
{"text":"OMG. Don't miss the kimchi fried rice! Kimchi pancakes are wonderful. Owner is adorable.  Itty bitty place and always a wait but worth every second!!"}
{"text":"Please do yourself a favor and go, if you're a Korean food lover. The owner is super friendly, and if you sit at the counter, you can watch her cook. Go for the bulgoki!"}
{"text":"Best south Korean restaurant in pittsburgh , i ordered spicy rise and chicken it was so delicious ."}
{"text":"Love the Golden Pig. Small space, and room for less than a dozen, but authentic Korean food. Sit at the counter, and enjoy watching the food being prepared. Spicy means spicy here, but oh, so enjoyable for those of us who love it.  Don't skip the Korean pancakes."}
{"text":"I had driven by this place many times thinking...\"gotta get there\".  I finally got the chance with two of my daughters last night.  I can't wait to go again to try more of the menu...it was fantastic.  There were two people working (owner and ?) and the service was very personal and homey.  We took her recommendation for the girls (man duc...?) and I had a spicy chicken dish (name escapes me).  I broke a sweat (love it), and the girls went through their food (split an order) and got another half-order.  DELICIOUS! Very small place (two tables and 4-5 seats at a bar).  ENJOY!!  I hope this place is here for a long time!"}
{"text":"Walking into this place, you definitely wouldn't think it would produce amazing food but I was wrong. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the atmosphere inside of the shop. It's definitely more of a take-out place, and I wasn't exactly greeted in the most friendly way. The service got better and better the longer we were there. I got the Kalbi, which was awesome and flavorful. I would love to get it again, but I feel I should try bulgogi as I've heard it's a favorite of nant. My wife is a vegetarian and they had many options for her to try."}
