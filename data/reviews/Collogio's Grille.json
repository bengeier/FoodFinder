{"text":"This is a new addition to the food services in Pittsburgh North Hills Area. (You must be patient and have time if you want to enjoy the freshly cooked Kebabs on a Clay baked Oven.  Chicken Shashlik was off the hook.  Very reasonably priced.  Oh i must mention the Lamb Burgers.   I will be back soon."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! If you like kabobs, Schwarma, lamb & Indian specialties you need to try this place. They have only been open 3 months, have big plans to make this place great backed up by good food. I had the chicken schwarma pita & it was amazing. The seasonings on the chicken were delicious. If you know what Tandori chicken tastes like that is the type of seasoning. It comes on a pita with lettuce, tomato, cucumber & a sauce that is similar to taziki, but a mixture of 3 sauces. It was delicious & filling. My fianc√© had the Naan kabob with chicken, which he loved. They are going to start a lunch & dinner buffet next week. It's great to have another great local option in the North Hills that is not another lame chain."}
{"text":"By far and away the best kebabs in the burgh. Second time here and the food has been fantastic both times.  Tried the mango lassi this time as well and it was great as well.  We will definitely be regulars."}
