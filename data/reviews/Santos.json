{"text":"Was here for a party last weekend and had a blast. They play great Jazz music on Sundays and the tapas are really amazing. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night and the place was virtually empty when we arrived. Montreal must have a later dinner crowd, because by the time we left around 10pm it was starting to fill up. 

Our waitress was new, so she couldn't help with a lot of recommendations as she hadn't tried much yet (other than try to upsell, which she did a lot). 

We had the salmon tartar, which was fantastic. Also had a bottle of La Crema pinot noir, which is now one of our favorites and we're hoping to find it at home. 

The space is very cool, and the music was great. Good spot."}
{"text":"Aggressive steroid ridden staff makes this place a miserable experience. 

I live in NYC and I came here on a Saturday night as the music sounded nice as I was walking by. I'm in my 40's, was sober and with my wife...so clearly not looking for trouble. 

The doormen were pleasant and mentioned the ground floor was full and there might be more space upstairs.  So we went inside for a drink and the club seemed to be pretty lively. 

But within 2 minutes some guy approached us and said we MUST check in our jackets. I replied that my jacket was very expensive and that we were only staying for a drink.  This guy clearly suffered from steroid anger issues, then decided to grab me by my jacket and throw me outside. How ridiculous.  I've lived in NYC for a long time and this would never be acceptable behavior. I guess standards are different in Montreal."}
{"text":"Worst service.  Waitress took over 20 mins to serve drinks so my friend had to leave and she got my order wrong never apologized and insisted I was wrong!! I couldn't wait another 20 mins for tapas so now I'm watching my friend eat and I don't have a plate. Never again"}
{"text":"This is a hot spot...sometimes hard to go in for some but because it's always jammed...best thing to do is grab a table. I was so surprised that the tapas was really really good. Drinks are strong. I shared 5 different tapas with a friend and had an extra sour mojito and only paid $50 and tip was included. Guys might still be hungry but just for you to know, there's the table d'hote that is $35 but only offered for a group of 8 to 10 ppl and everyone at the table have to take the deal or they don't do it which that's the reason I didn't give them the 5 stars. I truly think for food it's more of a girlie place unless you're a guy who could eat really small portions of food and not starve afterwards! Hope this was helpful!"}
{"text":"Infortunately I can't comment on food or drinks as we never got to try them. After 1.5 hrs in traffic getting to the old port through all closed roads all we wanted was a nice cold drink and a couple of appetizets. We went into Santos and were seated at a table. The water brought the menu and disappeared forever. After 15 min of waiting we finally saw a staff member and asked if we could order. He replied that he was just collecting dishes and couldn't take an order. I guess it didn't occur to him to call the waiter because after 5+ more minutes I went up to the bar to order drinks. The bartender was not busy, all his clients sitting at the bar were served and he was chatting with them. He told me he couldn't make me a drink because I was seated at the table and had to order from a waiter. I find it very poor managment when waiters are so busy that cannot attend clients in 20 mins while a bartender is not busy but not allowed to help. We waited a bit more then got up and left to some other place where we were served immediately."}
{"text":"I came across Santos the old-fashioned way -- it was recommended to me by the bartender at the hotel in which I'm staying.  It also came with a free drink card and who am I to turn down a free drink?!  

I hadn't planned on eating at Santos, but after trying to secure reservations at a few other very popular Montréal restaurants without success, I decided I'd redeem my free drink coupon after all, and have a tasty dinner while I was at it.  

I got there fairly early in the evening on a Saturday and it was nearly empty.  The staff seated me right away and, although I was eating alone, they sat me at a table, when I'm usually seated at the bar.  Most places can't be bothered to take up expensive table real estate with a single diner, so I was appreciative!  I actually found the staff to be attentive and friendly throughout my entire meal.  When I gave them the drink card, my waiter didn't even blink and said \"I'm sure my manager will take care of this for you.\"  Next thing I knew, the manager walked over with two shot glasses and said \"for eating with us tonight on recommendation from your hotel\".  Sweet!  And delicious.  Also, seeing how Santos is a martini bar, I also ordered a \"So Fresh\" martini.  I'm not a huge martini drinker and it wasn't as sweet as I'd have liked, but it was fresh and good.  

Santos is a tapas-style restaurant, so I ordered the Blackened Salmon with Avocado Salsa served with seasonal veggies and, of course, the frites!  Nom, nom, nom!   The presentation of the food was fantastic and was appropriately hot.  Lukewarm or lukecold food is a pet peeve of mine, but Santos did not disappoint.  The food was good and, while I don't think there was any avocado in the salsa, it was tasty nonetheless.  

They cleared my table quickly, but I ended up sitting far too long after dinner before they brought me my cheque.  I find this quite often in Toronto, too, but this was a little excessive.  They were busy, but I felt like the girl in the bubble who everyone was ignoring!  Once I finally got my cheque, I saw that they'd not only brought me the complimentary shot, but they'd also comp'd the martini.  Even sweeter.  And very generous.  I paid my respects by moving over to the bar after dinner and spending an appropriate amount of money on their delicious mojitos. :-)

Overall, I found Santos to be a great experience. Is it the best restaurant on the planet?  No, but it's perfectly located in Old Montréal with good food, great drinks, fantastic and helpful staff, and super cool decor."}
{"text":"Went last august for my bachelorette party & it was terrible. A bunch of us ordered salmon tartar yet none of our plates had the same consistency. I was missing the crackers on mine for starters and the waiter was annoyed to have to go get them for me. The food was lacking any taste and the service was terrible. Def not going back to eat."}
{"text":"Very nice place with an immersive atmosphere. Delicious tapas and cocktails. Good service.
Recommanded bar."}
{"text":"Ok, over all the wine is good, but the food really taste like \"Sh't\", this is probably the worst tapas bar I have been. We spent $90 on 4 super small dishes that tasted really bad. We would not go there again."}
{"text":"Went there pretty early in the evening; no crowds, no line ups, no waits. The food was great and the service even better!!! The standouts from what we had were the braised short rib which melts in your mouth (pic posted) and the seafood paella."}
{"text":"I was here at the end of April for a last dinner before I left the city for the summer.  We arrived fairly early in the evening; the restaurant was almost completely empty and the staff was still setting tables.  The décor was modern, with lots of red and black accents.  The temperature of the restaurant was a little too cool to be comfortable and I had to still my companion's sweater in order to keep warm. 

They appeared to have a full bar running and the wine list was decent.  

It took a while for a waiter to bring the menus and water.  However, when we asked him his suggestions on the menu, he was more that willing to help out and point towards things that he thought we might like.  To split between two, we ordered a garden salad, boeuf tartare, bruschetta, and tuna mini-burgers.  The wine list was also decent and we both found reds to try.   They appear to be running a full bar and were advertising a $1000 bottle special while we were there.  

The food took a while to arrive; however, when it did arrive I was delighted by the artistic presentation.  It was all very good, but my favorite was the boeuf tartare.  It was creamy with slight lemon undertones, absolutely perfect to spread on the crispy bread that was provided.  Equally delicious eaten by the spoonful.  The bruschetta and green salad were both fairly standard restaurant style.  Good and flavourful, but nothing to elaborate at great length upon.  The tuna burgers were....well... beef...  I think they probably messed up our order as both were on the menu. The beef ones were delicious, yet I had been looking forward to trying the tuna and was a little disappointed.  

The total for the entire meal including alcohol came to around $70.  While it was a good meal, I think the price was a little high considering the not-too-stellar service, the small portions, and the fairly standard quality.  I'm not entirely convinced that I'll return, as I think that I can do a little better for that much."}
{"text":"I was lucky to spend my thursday night and let me tell you there`s nowhere else i would have prefered to be. My friends and I grabbed seats at the bar only expecting to be in and out before our dinner reservation. Turns out we only left when we were politely asked to at 3AM when the bar closes. Dinner was amazing, David`s(sexy bartender) suggestions were brilliant and his cocktails even better. The music was amazing and as soon as the sun came down the crowd started rushing in. The restaurant turns into a very busy lounge filled with beautiful people. Overall the experience was amazing and we`ll definitely be back.

ps. i just came across a post saying there was no dancing... maybe not if you`re waiting in line outside but there was definitely lots of dancing going on.

See you next thursday Santos!"}
{"text":"If you have a big group with dudes and chicks, bottle service is required to get you thru that door to have fun. It's a small place to listen to drink and party. No dance floor to get your jiggy on but create your own. The boy's I have been there with have told me stories about girls heading to the boys washroom with them. IDK......... but overall it's fun but expensive."}
{"text":"First , it's beautiful. Dark woods and deep colors, good size bar, split level dining room. It fit perfectly into the experience of old Montreal. 

Our server was great. There wasn't a crowd (reading other reviews it sounds like this place gets packed), so she took her time describing the plates and answering our drink questions. 

The empanadas knocked my socks off. Ordered a second round. The pork dumpling were sweet and savory. Fresh guacamole was just that. I would have to recommend they had jalapeño, however, as there was no spice.

Started but Started with mojitos - multiple versions on the menu, but I chose the classic. It was fine but the Ave Maria cocktail was more in line with my tastes on a frigid damp Montreal evening. 

A side note. While here I discovered my preference for early dinner and drinks. It leaves the evening open for exploring and people watching along Catherine street, maybe a small dessert, too."}
{"text":"Traipsing around on a Sunday night, looking for a spot to eat dinner, we discovered many restaurants were closed.

After reading a few menus posted outside, Santos' looked the most appetizing to our light appetite. This tapas restaurant is trendy and loungy with red lights, house music, and waitresses in short black dresses. Clientele were young and good looking.

Our server asked us what kind of wine we were having but we decided on cocktails (Sapphire Fizz for me which was tasty). 

We ordered a green salad (good sized with sweet balsamic dressing), grilled chorizo (good, looked like a chicken breast) and goat cheese croquettes (awesome, recommended by our waitress). 

Drinks + food = $45 (not including tip)"}
{"text":"Nourriture très fade pour le prix. Longue attente pour le vin et pour tout en général. Beaucoup de staff qui semble ne rien faire d'utile avec leur va et vient stressant. Mauvaise expérience."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely ridiculous .. waited like 2 hours for the food .. the waiter was impatient rude and condescending .. my friend a woman by the way had to wait outside 15 mins even though it was our friend birthday party she was by herself and the place was not full at all .. the one good thing I will say is that DJ was absolutely AMAZING which pretty much save the whole experience 
I would not recommend santo to anyone"}
{"text":"So, apparently you are not good enough to set foot in here as a customer unless you wear pants. No shorts allowed no matter how warm it is outside. I would maybe recommend going to a more friendly and hospitable bar down the street that does not have an inconvenient dress code as all you are doing is spending money and drinking alcohol not signing a new bill into legislation..."}
{"text":"Allen, the manager there, definitely suffers from Napoleon complex. He is completely obnoxious and rude to guests. We made a reservation on the website and after we pressed submit, it said confirmed. At the door he said reservations aren't confirmed unless he personally calls or emails. Instead of inviting us in for a drink and trying to find us a table, he just gave us some attitude and suggested we go this sister restaurant for dinner. He told us when we got back we could immediately get in to the club.

Apparently he told multiple people this and we witnessed him straight up lie to people's faces that he never said that. He tried that with us but the bouncer stepped in and reminded him of our conversation.

Not sure why it was difficult to get in. Inside was very skeezy and the crowd seemed mostly 40+ year olds. We stayed for one cocktail (gross) and bounced."}
{"text":"Small bar with expensive food and very tight. The drinks are not that great for the price. For old port montreal you can save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars on the planet. It is just damn HOT. This is a place you can bring a date. The ratio here on a typical weekday evening is pretty balanced if you get there early evening. I actually prefer that time over the post-11pm hour from Thurs-Sat when it opens up as a dance floor. The logistics aren't really conducive to meeting other patrons aside from the bar perhaps. The bartenders are famously attractive and they make terrific martinis.  The ambiance is quite lovely and the venue is on a narrow cobblestone street in the quaint Old Port area of the city, adjacent from the famous Hotel Nelligan.  I highly recommend one visits this place if you're looking for a sleek and sexy bar to enjoy a drink."}
{"text":"Ladies' Night at Santos was a blast! For a Tuesday evening the tapas bar/restaurant had a pretty decent crowd. This was probably because they offered unlimited drinks (a selection of 4 including sangria, gin, vodka, and tequila) with the purchase of $25.00 worth of tapas. For places in Old Mtl this is a solid deal and we were in!

For a busier Tuesday with the deal going the servers who we thought would be scrambling were actually helpful, polite and quick! Kudos. And while we thought the tapas would be teeny, they were the perfect size and filled us up on our night out. We tried the calamari, cous cous salad and the salmon tartare. All good options!

The decor and ambience is beautiful! Dimly lit old chests and lanterns with a modern feel.

Haven't tried the restaurant outside of this weekly event but I'd definitely recommend t on a Tuesday night. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"A small pace with a Tex/ Mex menu. Had a combo band playing. Food was fresh and delicious. Staff very friendly and attentive. Real gem in the Old Town of Montreal. Reasonable prices. Bartender looks like Megan Draper who is also from Montreal."}
{"text":"They just started their Thursday evening 5 a 7, great vibe and great tunes. They have a new DJ who really knows how to transition the music throughout the night. Service was a little slow for food.  Drinks came on time. A mixed aged group and something for everyone who wants to go out for a drink and good music after work. It does get pretty busy by 7, so you won't really be able to hear other afterwards."}
{"text":"I feel compelled to this write review so that I may save others from the brutal dining experience I endured at Santos.

My friends and I had never planned to attend Santos that night in Vieux-Montreal, we were planning to go to a recommended restaurant named Garde-Manger, but unfortunately GM was absolutely packed without a free seat in the house.

We then decided to walk along Rue Saint Paul to find another resto as we were all famished. As we turned the corner, there was Santos. Their menu was posted outside (like most restaurants in the area) and they had a fairly diverse and interesting Tapas selection. We decided to go in even though the place was decorated and lit like a nightclub.

Upon walking in I could not believe how red everything was. Tables, chairs, fixtures, lights, candle holders, even the staff were mostly dressed in red. The décor of the establishment was hurting, there was art on the wall that didn't flow and did not belong. Essentially this place was the exact opposite of what Vieux-Montreal is, IMO.



To start, we ordered a pitcher each of Mojito & Sangria along with an array of Tapas. The Mojito mix could have used some more sugar and perhaps some more muddling, although it wasn't terrible, I have just experienced much better (Copacabana/anywhere in Miami). The Sangria tasted like fruit juice, so much so that we had to ask the waiter if there was any alcohol in it. He instructed us that he gets asked that all the time and guaranteed there is the correct amount of alcohol in the pitcher, it's simply the way the bartender mixes it you don't really taste the alcohol. Our waiter had been solid up until that point and truthfully, I believed him.

Unfortunately...our Tapas began arriving:

Tomatoes w/ Mozzarella di Bufala- 4 slices of tomato on a plate with a half ball of mozzarella cheese on top, that's it. No salt and fresh black pepper or EVOO on the tomatoes, no EVOO drizzle on the cheese, no chiffonade of basil, no garnish? It is very disappointing when you order an item from a restaurant only to find that you could make it 10x better at home wearing a blindfold.   

Teriyaki Beef - tough, chewy, overcooked and riddled with sesame seeds, uninspired and poorly executed. If you are going to borrow a dish from another culture, do it properly.  Santos is a 15min walk from Chinatown, no excuses.

Fried Calamari w/ fried aioli - not bad at all, but then again, it's fried calamari. My only quam would be that it may have been a touch undercooked as the batter was a slightly softer than that crisp bite I am accustomed to. Overall though I can't really complain, I would rather have the calamari slightly undercooked then over.

Lemon Garlic Chicken - I think that's what it was called. Again... uninspired and chewy. Clearly forgettable.

Beef Tartare - the best executed dish of the night, nice presentation and solid flavour, especially with the capers. However, it was room temperature when it should have been at warmest cool. It did arrive last so maybe the meat wasn't chilled properly or it sat on the pass a minute too long. 

Last but not least we come to the toast. I believe it first arrived with the tartare, and the waiter brought us some more a few minutes later. This toast was the hardest toast I have ever received at any food establishment. At first I thought hey, maybe the chef left it on the grill too long and we got the one-off batch. Negative...The 2nd batch was harder than the first which led me to believe that they toast (maybe with a flamethrower) all their bread at once earlier on in the night so it's easier to get it out to the tables quicker. This is completely unacceptable. At the restaurant where I work our cheese toast is made to order, if it sits on the pass for a minute too long, or is on the grill for a second longer than it should be it gets tossed out right away. Santos should give out dentist referrals with their bread. 

In summation the 1 star goes to our waiter named Médi (sp?). He was kind and attentive to us and deserves not to be working in that establishment. Will I return to Santos? I don't see how that would be possible. I can't stress enough how this establishment does not flow with all that Vieux-Montreal should be, there is no sense of history, architecture, preservation or substance in it. It really kills me to write such piss poor reviews on restaurants, but it just had to be done in this case. Because of Santos' location and their over the top flashy appearance, I'm sure this review will have little sway on the majority of their customers as it appeals to the masses. The end."}
{"text":"Une place super le fun pour prendre un verre ou manger un petit quelque chose dans le vieux port ! Ils sont l'un des seul bar ouvert la semaine sur st-paul du coté ouest de st-laurent ! ( en tout cas il etait ouvert le mardie a 17:30) 

L'ambiance est tres bien et la place est bien decoree ! Le service etait moyen, mais on a juste pris un verre alors je ne veux pas juger trop vite !"}
{"text":"Food is good but way overpriced for ehat you get!
Hype little spot to have an overpriced drink....  had the summer 76 drink and tasted only like water and cilantro....   air conditioning was having everybody move from the upstairs corner when they should've put the heat on!!!    Service was extrimely slow but the employees we're very friendly and polite!!  Would revise prices on the items cause its not a gourmet gastronomy place....   people are nice but should stop moving you from table to couch when you've started eating for accommodation to newly arrived couples or groups.....  very anoying!!  Would not recommend....  sorry guys!"}
{"text":"A good, chill spot. Came here on Sunday night around 10pm after strolling around Old Port with my bf. Looked cute from the inside - spacious, nice vibe, good music. The DJ played a lot of old school hip hop + R&B...right up our alley. Sat at the bar and had a couple drinks. Service isn't particularly great but our bartender was nice and she made a solid old fashioned."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever although our waiter was awesome the food was ok, the ambiance was a little tense i find. Definitely not coming back"}
{"text":"J'y ait été  vers minuit. Il y avait un line un d'une vingtaine  de minutes. Pas trop pire quand il ne fait pas trop froid et qu'on décide  de sortir dernière  minute. Je rentre, c'est plein. Le monde fête, danse et s'amuse. Il me faut plus de tequila pour en arriver à ce stade. Il y a un gros bar qui est rempli de gens qui attendent des commandes. Les shooters sont commandés, la musique et l'ambiance  est bonne.  Par contre, je n'ai pas trop aimé  la clientèle.  Je me suis senti avec plein de Mean girls. Elles te devisageaient :(  Aussi, le bar n'avait pas de Southern Confort. Par la suite, le bar n'avait  plus de verre à Shooter. Assez ordinaire..m"}
{"text":"great place. awesome ambiance. the servers were top knotch....not to mention the ladies that were coming in and out. Its something out of the movies. Somewhere I will be going back to for years to come for sure"}
{"text":"So I went to Santos with a couple of friends for Ladies Night. The ambiance, decor and music were great and the place itself is really charming. The food isn't so bad either. What we did not like, was the (really) poor service that we got. It was a pain in the ass to get our drinks, the food and our bills. It was really frustrating and they were mistaken in our orders, giving us wrong drinks, forgetting about this and that, serving other people who came way after us, before us and they made us wait about 20 minutes to get the bills out and another 15 minutes to bring the machine so we could pay and leave. The waiter was rude. We were so displeased from our experience that we left and went to another greater restaurant. Bad experience! It could have been so much better, it's disapointing!"}
{"text":"Good music and packed on a Saturday night. They force you to check in your coat right at the door. Bartenders don't really seem to be attentive or skilled. Crowd is twenty somethings."}
{"text":"No big deal. No great happy hour. Service is mediocre and so is the food. Drinks weren't bad but a bit price."}
{"text":"Nice place, no cover, good music and beautiful people! Line was a bit long, but if you get bottle service you can skip that! It's has a chill friendly vibe, good place to go dance and unwind without drama!

Also check this spot out on a Tuesday, its fun ladies night, except the music was thumbs down."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, and it always a good time. Good music. Nice crowd. Not much beer on tap, but you won't go thirsty."}
{"text":"Located in old Montreal, this place has a very nice athmosphere. It is trendy, young, and has great food and service. We went there on a Friday night and the DJ that was playing there was really good, mixing old and new songs.
It is a tapas restaurant so we ordered several dishes:
AAA filet mingnon with sauteed mushrooms - it was divine. The meat was cooked with perfection.
Mini tuna burguer - not so \"mini\" actually. To me it was a full size burguer. It was light and very tasty.
Goat cheese salad with pine nuts and strawberry vinagrette - very light and delicious salad, and the warm goat cheese really gave it a special touch.
Manchego cheese and nut foundue - I guess I was expecting something different, but I was not very impressed. By the time I got to that dish, the cheese was hard and just didn't do anything for me.
Overall I had a very good experience, and I would definitely go back to Santos."}
{"text":"We came here around 11pm to grab drinks since we had dinner somewhere else earlier. But the body guard looking guy or bouncer whatever he is called told us we are not allowed to come in unless we are dining there. Not sure if this is a common style of restaurant business in Montreal but this is not how you attract more business. Looks of the other reviews you are going to be needing more customers."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere and look. My wife and I were looking for somewhere to have a drink and get out of the rain with our daughter and this place was perfect. 

Very friendly staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The only thing saving this place is the music. A group of 10 girls (bachelorette party) stumbled upon this place on a Friday night. We heard the music from outside and figured we liked what we heard. When we got to the door, we were told by the doorman that in order to go inside, we'd HAVE to buy a bottle (around $250 CAD). This in itself is rare, as we're from the NYC area and girls are usually never told they need to buy tables. The shadiest part was that THEY MADE US GIVE A CREDIT CARD BEFORE WE EVEN WALKED IN THE DOOR! In hindsight, we realize we shouldn't have. 

As soon as we walked in, the place wasn't even that packed and the $250 table was literally HALF of a plain wooden high-top table!!!! with no stools! Right next to the bar! We had to actually SHARE a table with people (with their bags, drinks and flailing drunk arms included!). What a mess. If I'm paying $250, I want a private area and a seat. The minute we realized what happened, we knew we'd been \"had.\" My friend went to speak to the doorman and ask for our money back, he actually shrugged his shoulders and walked away from her! They already had our credit card. 

But --- it was 1am by this point and we wanted to make sure the bachelorette had a good night, so we swallowed our pride and dealt with it. 

Obviously they just took advantage of the fact that we were from out of town. Not recommended. Shady practices."}
{"text":"Hugely poor service.  Inattentive, moody staff and felt ignored.   It wasn't even busy at the time.

Try to avoid if possible unless you want to stand around waiting for someone to help you."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town we asked everyone we conversed with where to go and after fly gin didn't let us in without bottle service or a reservation we were directed to Santos. It was a ton of fun, great hip hop and rap music to dance to, plus a cool atmosphere! The bartenders seemed somewhat distracted with their friends on the Thursday night we went, but overall it was a great time!"}
{"text":"I am a finger food lover and that definitely includes tapas. Needless to say I did enjoy this place. 

I ordered their six vegetarian tapas and shared it with one other person. It was filling but we weren't stuffed. So about three tapas each is a good serving. 

All the food was delicious, my favourite was the nachos; my parters favourite was the rice and mushrooms in garlic butter. 

I should also point out that a meat-eating friend ate with us and noted that his fillet minon was very tender and delicious. His salad also came with fresh figs that impressed me. 

If you don't mind spending a little money, give this place a try. If you want to be on the conservative side, stick to the vegetarian options... They are a couple bucks cheaper."}
{"text":"My friend had her birthday at Santos and it was turned out to be the most DISAPPOINTING bar I've ever been too. We had called several times to ask if we could make a reservation and at what time we should arrive and it turned out that, following their suggestions, barely no one was able to enter. The staff members were NOT cooperative at all. Worst customer service experience. Turned out we had to move the birthday elsewhere and let's say that no one wants stress and drama on her birthday, right?

I would NEVER recommend this place, ever."}
{"text":"Bartender made a fantastic Negroni. The winter squash soup is itself worth coming for. Fantastic ambience. Wait staff was attentive but didn't intrude. Need to set fire to the patio furniture upstairs, but any of the downstairs furnishing would be stolen if I could pack them."}
{"text":"Very trendy and happening. This place is usually quite busy on Friday and Saturday night, with a relatively young and good looking crowd. 

All the tapas that we have tried were good, but I would particularly recommend the Filet Mignon, and the \"Honeydew melon with prosciutto and Porto reduction\". And, you might want to try the Rosé Sangria!"}
{"text":"Never been to eat but if you're looking for a place to have a drink and dance till 3AM around Saint-Paul Street in Montreal?! THAT'S THE PLACE!
Good music, good crowd, no entry fee."}
{"text":"So there's a bit of a story behind how we wound up at Santos.

We had made a reservation for Garde Manger, which is basically right next door, and we were shown to two seats at a very crowded bar. Two stools over from us was a very drunk businessman harassing the woman sitting next to him. This was super annoying and obnoxious, but we tried our best to ignore him. He eventually attempted to draw us into his inebriated conversation and since we hadn't actually ordered anything yet, we decided to get the hell out of there.

(As an aside, the sloppy drunkard also roped the bartender into his conversation and the bartender participated! I think if someone is that far gone, the employees have a duty to throw the inconsiderate idiot out - especially when it's clear he's bothering other customers.)

Anyway, after we left we walked a few feet and noticed Santos. It was pretty empty and the vibe looked cool, so we decided to give it a shot.

We were shown to a very spacious booth and we began poring over the fairly limited to menu in search of appetizing dishes. We ordered:

Croquetas Trilogy (manchego, mushroom and jamon serrano): These three croquettes were absolutely irresistible. They're small but they packed a lot of flavor and the accompanying sauce was very tasty.

Clarisse's Shrimps: This is an unusual dish, to be sure. It's essentially a shrimp quesadilla, which sounds weird but actually works really well. There's a very robust shrimp flavor and it's perfectly accompanied by a green salsa-type sauce.

Tuna crudo with \"pimientos de padron\" and ginger chips: This was the one weak spot in the meal. The generous chunks of tuna were basically drowned out by an intense citrus flavor. The chips were tasty, though, and so was the accompanying sauce.

Mexican style chicken wings: I'm not generally a big chicken wing guy, but these were pretty phenomenal. The chicken was cooked perfectly, but the real hero here was the accompanying barbecue sauce. It was so tangy and so delicious I feel like I could've drunk an entire mug of the stuff.

The service was just so-so. Our waitress wasn't especially friendly and in fact seemed annoyed by our very presence, but I suppose you have to expect that when you're eating at a \"cool\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Beautiful place but HORRENDOUS SERVICE!

Issues:
1. did not have our reservation
2. seated us in the worst place in the restaurant because they had other big reservations but managed to lose ours...
3. Super slow and bad service
4. Very, very limited menu
5. Expensive for quality of food (meat was undercooked)
6. Supposedly a tapas place?!? yeah....
7. Ordered a brazilian coffee, was told the machine was broken, coffee mysteriously appeared in a cup, was luke warm and cup half full. Gross..Was then charged 7$ for that nasty coffee!!
8. Was then told by the waiter that they had another reservation coming so we would have to give up our table... Unbelievable!
9. Waiter poorly attempted to remedy the situation by offering us a shot
10.Had to hunt down the waiter to get bill and then again later to pay it.

This place is only passable, if you already happen to be in the area and are only there for a drink or 2, besides that, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY! 

-The only good things I have to say about this place is that the decor is lovely and the DJ (Eric Chorney) was outstanding-"}
{"text":"Je vais devoir adapté mon avis lors d'une prochaine visite, mais je suis tombée sous le charme de la beauté du restaurant :) ! Nous y sommes arrêtés pour prendre un verre et l'endroit était vraiment charmant! 

Le service était long et le serveur ne m'a pas servi le bon drink, mais ce n'est pas bien grave, c'était bien quand même !"}
{"text":"I had an unfortunate experience when arriving to your location Saturday night anticipating a great night filled with enjoyment with my girlfriend who was visiting at the time. I was mistreated by the main guy organizing the entrance to the club at night on February 18, 2017 at 10:43. Firstly, we had a reservation for 10:30 and were told it would only be canceled if 15 minutes past time. We arrived precisely at 10:42 and were talking to the main individual in charge that night. He was with us at the door and mistreated both my significant other and I, even mocking us at some point. Additionally, he cancelled the reservation without even informing us regardless of being in time before the 15 minute cutoff. I recommend you fire the individual we talked to that night as he was incredibly rude, unprofessional, and seemed to lack the most basic understanding of proper customer service. You have lost a customer for life. ."}
{"text":"You want Tapas people? You got it. 

I went on a Thursday night and it was not that busy. The music was blasting and I asked for a good local beer. Once I was brought a bottle called M (I assume it stood for Montreal) I was kind of let down. It tasted like feet. 

Ok, I'm not reviewing the beer, it just put a bit of a damper on things. Anyway, we ordered about six plates to share between two people and it wasn't bad. I guess I was hoping for a little better.  Basically, I'll come back, but I'll probably go somewhere else first."}
{"text":"To be honest, I want to go with 3 stars. For a tapas joint, the portions were pretty small. 

All of the food was good or great. My mojito made with maple syrup was awesome. Definitely one of my favorite drinks ever.

But it was the poutine that put me over the top. Their poutine was some of the best poutine I had on my trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Pros: solid food. 
Cons: poor service and underwhelming portion size (and yes, I know tappas are supposed to be small)"}
{"text":"I've always heard about Santos from all my friends, and just got the opportunity to go there for a late dinner and drinks. We got tapas to share with friends, and their tapas plates are really small, so you basically have to order a lot of food, but it's fine when you split it. As for the drinks, my friends loved their mojitos! I got the Santos Sangria, which honestly didn't like it that much, it had an aftertaste I didn't really love.

but the feeling of Santos is good, nice chill music, and nice vibe, and a bit fancy but not in an extreme level. It's good if you'd like to go to a bar to get drinks, and maybe order just a bit food later at night I'd say, rather than dinner."}
{"text":"I have to admit, there is absolutley  nothing bad i can say about this place. We got the goat cheese and spinach tapas. Delicious. We also got quesadillas. Honestly, they were more like fajitas. Usually when i order quesadillas, i expect cheese. These had tortillas, chicken, peppers with choices of sour cream, guacamole and salsa. Fajitas right? That's okay, because they were delicious. My husband got the ribs. They were a tab bit dry for our taste, but still great. The sangria is amazing,  nothing wrong with them and everything right. Our waiter was exceptional. I wish i could remember his name, but we gave him a great tip. Bigger than we've ever given. He was just that good.I would def go again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for my friends birthday. I am not a Fan of Spanish cuisine or Tapas, so i wasn't really looking forward to the supper part of the night. 
I got there around 7:30pm and the place was already 3/4 full. I was immediately drawn to the decor and ambiance, stunning bar with a lit message in top saying \" Welcome home\" also a mix of modern and old century furniture. People were just mingling and laughing, I really enjoyed the vibe that I was getting. When everybody from our group arrived the waiter, Anas, explained tonus that for $40 per person we could order a 4 course meal specially designed by the chef that was half Mexican, half Spanish.  I personally didn't like anything on their menu so i thought this would be a great way to discover what this restaurant/lounge had to offer.

They started us of with a board of chorizo, fresh grilled bread, cheese, pickled vegetables and some spicy mustard on the side. Then they brought grilled romaine lettuce with a Latin inspired Caesar sauce, which although I don't like anchovies, I really enjoyed this plate. This was followed by grilled bread with a mashed tomatoes, you could compare it to bruschetta, but with a latin twist. Then we got cheese balls, which were really crispy outside and very chewing and delicious inside and last but not least grilled octopus served on a toasty tortilla with avocado and feta cheese. I really enjoyed all the flavours and nuance each plate and. 

Also their drinks were THE BOMB!!! As the night progress the music got louder and around 10pm DJ kicked in with some really great mixes from the 80's up to the newest hits.

Again our waited was outstanding, making sure everybody was happy, always checking if we needed anything. I place I would happily go back to."}
{"text":"CRAPY SERVICE, and by crapy I mean arrogant, disrespectful and annoying waiters. The place is tiny. The food is average and overpriced. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The music is good though but too crowded to dance. Ugh."}
{"text":"I was in search of a good taste of Montreal nightlife and came across Santos-- a very cool lounge with a trendy, attractive crowd, great old school music and an all around fun vibe. This restaurant/ lounge is located a hop, skip and jump away from Le Petit Hotel-- my home base during a brief trip last month. It was a tad awkward being out alone, and the place was packed...but the bartenders were friendly and made me feel welcome as sipped my drink and took in the lively scene for a bit. There are ample chairs and seating upstairs that overlooked the main floor---ideal if you're just wanting to relax and talk. The drinks were overpriced, but I think most people were there to enjoy the music, take in a good vibe and celebrate the weekend."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant. We were not aware that Tuesday was ladies night so I was excited to know I could drink for free. That is until my first drink arrived. I ordered their \"swipe right\" which was tequila, mango juice and lime. There was no hint of tequila at all. So I was hopeful that my tequila with a splash of pineapple juice would be a bit stronger. Not the case. The drinks were free so I guess I shouldn't have been too surprised. Food on the other hand was pretty good. The short rib tacos and bone marrow was great. The shrimp quesadilla was ok, although the shrimp was chopped so finely you could barely tell there was shrimp inside. The green salad was a bit salty. The staff was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Enough of sober time, I'm ready for more drinks so we check out this really swanky tapas bar called Santos in the area. For those of you who knew me in DC, you know that my license plate was named after the Flirtini, from which I earned the nicknamed following a relatively tame family event in a martini bar in uppity Connecticut. Naturally then, I would make my way towards the Fucktini which I tried at Santos. Let me break it down for y'all. Fucktini = Absinthe + Smirnoff + Red Bull, which appropriately tastes like ass. 

The place was really big and I hear it gets really packed but on that Sunday it was pretty dead. It's nicely decorated and there was some easy going jazz music. Overall, pretty chill place."}
{"text":"I found my experience here underwhelming.  We ordered some sangria pitchers to get the night going but it was weak (almost like juice with a few drops of alcohol added).   The service was really bad.   There were large delays to get food and when it finally did arrive not everyone got what they ordered all at the same time (or within a reasonable amount of time).  Some had to wait a lot longer than others to get their tapas.  The food itself was decent."}
{"text":"Wonderful bar in Old Montreal. They have a nice list of unique cocktails. The bartender made me a special drink made with mezcal. It was smoky goodness. Don't miss Old Montreal. It's beautiful."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to Montreal for a quick little get away from our kids, so we came on a budget. My bf read online somewhere that Santos is a great place for ladies night. So that's exactly what we did on our Tuesday night in Montreal. The deal was that from 6-12, you would have to order 25 dollars worth of tapas to get \"unlimited drinks\" aka \"open bar.\" It said it just like that on the flyer they gave us with the rest of the drink menu. 

The ambience of the restaurant was nice, our table was really small though so we used the two chairs as tables. The music was amazing too. 

Our waiter was very kind, he spoke French and English, but more fluent in french (which maybe the reason for the language barrier at the end of the night when getting our check...)

The food was good, my bf ordered the charcuterie  board and it came with two selections of cheese, and two kinds of Italian meats, mini pickles, a few pickled veggies, onions, pistachios, candies pecans, fig spread, mustard and some fruit and bread. My only complaint would be the amount of cheese was so little. And for 25 I would expect a little more. 

I ordered three tapas (so I could get the unlimited drinks deal) first was the shrimp tapas and it kinda looked like a quesadilla garnished with guacamole and another spicy sauce. Second was the tuna tartar with rice chips. The tuna tartar was very different from what I normally taste, it was sour. It was different, but not something I would order again. Lastly was the Mexican style wings, which has a BBQ infused sauce on it. I liked the sauce and the plate came with a paint brush which was kinda cute. Over all they did a good job plating the dishes.

For drinks I ordered the Ave Maria (came with a ton of fruits) 2 Ya Man (to die for drink) and then a white sangria and a shot of tequila. My borfriend for the Potion, vodka soda water and a shot of tequila too. 

So fast forward to the end of the night, I had already ordered 25 dollars worth of tapas and we get the bill and legit, my mouth dropped to the floor when I saw the bill. It was $170 Canadian dollars. Like whaaattttt?!?! Our waiter changed me for all of my drinks despite me ordering over 25 worth of tapas. And then it dawned on me that maybe it was only for the 4 drinks that were listed on the \"ladies night -open bar - free drinks - unlimited\" flyer only? Well whatever it is, I don't think I will ever go back because of this. 

We paid 200 (30 for tip) and left with dust bunnies in our wallets."}
{"text":"I witnessed Allen the manager supposedly 'working' but instead was at one of the tables with friends giving girls drinks and shots till they were falling over drunk and basically were falling into us at our table and passing out with their head down on our table.  Not sure how this guy is getting paid for managing this place when he seems to actually being creating the problems that managers of a bar are typically trying to solve for and avoid.   When we asked around everyone said he does the same thing every night...drinks for free, gets himself and a bunch of girls completely drunk and incoherent.   There was also mention that he takes his employees tips... My advice to the owner... Your bar is going to go down with the reputation of this Allen guy quick unless you get rid of him.

The rest of the staff was great and food was pretty good... But was disgusted by the scene this Allen character was creating.  Those poor girls couldn't even stand they were so drunk."}
{"text":"I went to Santos with a few friends for Ladies night. We were greeted and seated right away - we got a great table with comfy couch seating in a corner. Anthony was our waiter and we were pleased with his attentive and animated service. I read some other reviews about how rude the service / manager / bouncer was but we didn't encounter any of that. On the contrary, the service was impeccable so if you're worried about service just ask to be seated in Anthony's section and I'm sure you'll be well taken care of.  The music was not my favorite but it wasn't too loud - it was definitely loud but not so loud that we couldn't hold conversations. We ordered the mixed charcuterie platter, meat balls, seafood salad, tortilla, olives, shrimp on the plancha, chicken skewers (plancha) and churros. The food was served with good timing, we didn't have to wait for drinks - it seemed like the timing of the food and drinks was perfect / seamless. I noticed that the portions of food was inconsistent but other than that I have no complaints. Everything was hot and didn't seem to sit on the pass. I hate it when you order something and it arrives and it looks like it sat on the pass for 20 minutes. Big pet peeve of mine. Anyway, all the food was tasty and served fresh at an appropriate temperature. I think the meat balls were my favorite dish. They were tender, well seasoned and piping hot. The charcuterie platter was small for $20 but this goes back to that comment I made about inconsistent portions because I ordered it the time before last and the portions were really generous. Also, most of the plates can be shared by 3, but for some reason the charcuterie platter was to be shared by 2. Being 3 it was a bit annoying to have to cut everything in 3's on the charcuterie plate. We are already planning our next visit! I think this might be my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"I've been to Santos quite often and I always have mix feelings about it. Don't come here for food. It's not worth it. I would suggest going somewhere else to eat if you can. UNLESS you really want to lock yourself a spot and stay after to dance/party. The food is overpriced and not good. If you come after 11 pm, get ready to line up. Bouncers can be a bit rude but just be patient. If you order bottles, you have higher chances of getting in. I like Santos mostly for the vibe/music but less for the service/food."}
{"text":"This was my second time in Montreal but first time in Old Port. We tried to get into multiple restaurants (on a Saturday night) and couldn't because we didn't have reservations. When we came to santos, it was packed but luckily the host was able to fit us in! I got the sangria which was amazing! My boyfriend got a glass of wine (which was actually really small) and then switched to vodka tonics. We ordered the calamari and oysters. I would rate the calamari high on my list, while the oysters were mediocre. Overall, the atmosphere was very fun and included a DJ playing amazing music (great for 90s kids). Will definitely be back on any trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Our first time in Montreal and we stopped in for a quick drink. The staff is great and drinks were on point. Really cool atmosphere like most places in old montreal. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Santos specializes in Spanish Tapas (small plates). Staying true to form, the only wines they serve are Spanish. They also have the largest variety of mojitos I've ever seen. We shared the Blueberry-Lavender; Perfection.

This being our second stop of the night, we shared an order or the grilled calamari. They hold a nice charcoal flavor and are simply treated with fresh lemon, lime, and a few other spices."}
