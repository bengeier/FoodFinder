{"text":"Just had the opportunity to try Mendoza's Cuisine. It opened last weekend. I'd Ike to give 3.5 stars, but with in,y 3 or 4 to choose from, it's closer to a 4. First let me say, I probably would not have noticed it, but for the large Steak, Pasta, Seafood sign that caught my son's eye ages ago, and we've been waiting for it to open. It's not the greatest location.  The decor is okay, lots of small tables...they had to put two together for our party of five. The drink menu lists pellegrino, but I was served Perrier. Not a big deal, but at $12.50 a bottle, quite steep.  We had the stuffed chilli, grilled calamari, and kale Caesar appetizers. The stuffed chilli and grilled calamari were both excellent. The kale salad, was, well...spinach...not kale. A bit disappointing, but I like spinach, so okay. It was a tad overdressed for me also, but at least the dressing was good, not great, but good.  We ordered the Paella, Seafood Linguini, Cornish Hen, Surf and Turf, and Ribeye. All were very tasty. The ribeye, although flavourful and tender, was not cooked to order...how could it be cooked medium rare, when it was less than half an inch thick? It was pretty disappointing, especially after seeing my son's Filet with the Surf and Turf! I had buyer's remorse! His was cooked to perfection, tender and juicy. Glad we skipped the port Demi sauce, which would have been overpowering. The Cornish hen was tasty and not dry. The seafood linguini was very tasty, and the paella was good, except filled with empty mussel shells.  Dessert was ice cream for the kids...soon they will start making their own, will have to try that. The lemon custard, was very good.  Overall, the food was good. Mostly up to Chef Mendoza's standards from what I remember a long time ago at the Lake Grill. Disappointed with the ribeye, and the salad, but happy with everything else. I'd be interested to hear if anyone else tries it. At $300+ for a family of five with only one glass of wine, it's not going to be an every week thing for me, but I might check out their Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Mendoza's since the Grand Opening and we decided on Brunch. Who doesn't love brunch? Combined meals FTW! I've been to a few brunches and they all seem to have the same stuff...time to see what they have to offer.   It was small, but don't let that deceive you! There was the standard omelette bar and roast beast station, but what's in between those stations is what makes this brunch buffet stand out. The platter of roasted veggies caught my eye; peppers, zucchini, eggplant with a light coating of olive oil and a dash of seasoning. I went back 3 times just for this. They have your standard garden and caesar salads but they also had fancy salad; berries, goat cheese, nuts and housemade dressings. Tasty! In addition to omelettes, they also had scrambled eggs and candied bacon. You read it...Candied BACON. There was also a spicy Seafood Paella and the best Italian Wedding Soup I've ever had. It's made in house by an Italian Chef, so you KNOW It's good and authentic.   They had house made Shirley Temples to drink and a delightful fruit and cake tray for dessert. The Shirley Temple did not look like the ones I've had in the past, but it tasted just like it; a taste of childhood! The fruit was fresh and so were the cakes. They also offered us a complimentary mimosa. Mmmmm.    One tip: Hang on to your napkin! The servers get in the zone when they're picking up your empty plates and tend to snag your napkin along with it! They're used to clearing the tables completely, so it's understandable. You can always ask for another if yours goes missing!   The service was pleasant and efficient, like my last visit. The plates were cleared quickly and the food was refilled with fresh regularly. The chef at the omelette bar was the same chef that made the soup. She answered all of my questions about the soup and other items in the buffet. It was nice to talk to the actual chef! She was great!   Another great visit to Mendoza's. Glad to see the Grand Opening was just the beginning. I will be back to try their main course! With good quality food like this, how can I not go back??   Make a date, go to Mendoza's!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst dining experience we have ever encountered.   We came here with my father and mother in law for Father's Day brunch.  Based on our Lake Grill experience we thought it would be  a safe bet.    Unfortunately it was a terrible decision.  Even though the place was not busy for a holiday they informed us the kitchen was backed up.  We decided to order anyways.  Almost 2 hours later food came in separate occasions, cold and very low quality food (2 hours for a pancake!) 3 wrong orders and staff that kept trying to make up excuses for the wait.  Worst part it was my first father's day and my in laws came from abroad.  Thank you for ruining father's day.   My brother called and spoke to Mendoza himself and we got a coupon for a free appetizer at Lake Grill.  Very professional."}
