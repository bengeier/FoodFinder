{"text":"Miracle Mile???  

A Half An Inch is more like it.  Heard good things about this place.  Someone said their pastrami sandwiches were awesome.  So, in all fairness I didn't try their pastrami, but the BLT.  The thing came out on white wonder bread (not toasted so at least some of its 'flavor' could have been burned off) with a glob of mayo in the center of the bread with exactly 3 slices of bacon (not the thick kind) and one measly ice burg lettuce...you get more lettuce than that on a McDonald's burger. Speaking of Mickey D's, my BLT came with as many fries as their small kids Happy Meal, which is actually less than a small on their regular menu.  On top of it, the sucker cost $7 bucks...
holy crap, i think i died and went to hell."}
{"text":"This place was in Park Central and Christown Mall before Air Conditioning was invented. You cannot be around that long and not do something right. I give it 5 stars for quality and customer service. I use to eat there frequently, but now that I'm 44, I cannot eat this type of food as much. 

Rating healthy choices is a whole other topic, but I think everyone knows what a NY deli is all about."}
{"text":"We have been enjoying Straw Sandwiches and potato salad(don't forget the dill pickle) for years!!!!! We think the food is great, and they always have horseradish available, too!  The wait staff keep the tables clean and ready very quickly.  We always look forward to our sandwich at the Miracle Mile.  When you get your card punched several times, you get to pick any piece of pie or cake for your dessert-if you have room!  I forgot to say how fun it is to watch and listen to the grackle birds on the patio!"}
{"text":"The food is reminiscent of a hospital cafeteria. The staff is rude and the ambiance is tacky."}

{"text":"Who would have thought that the best deli sandwich I have ever had would be found in Arrowhead mall in the west valley of Phoenix?

Best pastrami I think I have ever had...and I know the search has been a long one after growing up on the east coast and dealing with alot of west-coast wannabees that claim they have the best. For years, I have tried them all. Nate 'n Al's in Beverly Hills, Cantor's in Hollywood, Art's, Junior's and Jerry's are good, but nothing compared to this cafeteria style food factory in Glendale, Arizona. They make their own and the place smells like a deli! Nowadays, delicatessens are like Walmart, but not Miracle Mile!

 Consistent, delicious and the New Yorker on rye with cole slaw and Russian dressing is my go-to sandwich. They also have Dr. Brown's Black Cherry Soda that makes the meal EVEN better!

Go in and introduce yourself to Josh. He is third generation of a family who knows deli. You will not be sorry."}

{"text":"I remember when there weren't so many Miracle Mile delis in Phoenix..and getting a pastrami straw took some strategy and patience and waiting at Park Central mall with hundreds of people. Today, you can get your straw and eat it too before you go back to the office at one of many locations. 

I'll admit to a bit of nostalgia over the mix of people and the long-I'm-going-to-wait-no-matter-what lines. 

Whenever I am in Phoenix, there are TWO must-have stops. One is some local place with Chorizo..and the other..is Miracle Mile. Thank GOD I don't have to go to New York for a good sandwich."}
{"text":"If you work in the area, you will certainly know of Miracle Mile.  Their sandwiches are huge, piled high and served with french fries and a pickle and they've been around forever.  I always get the vegetarian sandwich and it's delicious, but my mom always opts for the roast beef and she absolutely loves that. You know a place is good when you can barely find a spot to sit at and that's how Miracle Mile always is.  If you come a little before or after the lunch or dinner rush, you should be fine, otherwise expect a long line to order your food and a mad dash to secure a table. And if you like dessert, get the chocolate or carrot cake- they're both excellent."}
{"text":"Meh.
Maybe it was just that we decided to dine in 10 minutes prior to closing, but I was definitely not impressed. I had not been here in ages. Probably 10 years, maybe 15. No exaggeration. I remember nothing but good things about Miracle Mile. I remember being excited to come eat here. 
So one night while shopping at Arrowhead with a friend, I got a sudden craving for a pastrami sandwich with coleslaw and Thousand Island dressing. I was very excited to walk in and find that it was on the menu! I didn't have to special order it!
It was a good size sandwich.  Big enough that when cut in half, you still have to use both hands. I took my first bite and was immediately disappointed. Not that it was bad. It's just that I had fond memories of this place and I was really expecting something near the level of perfection of the #19 at Langer's in Downtown L.A.....or at the least Like Gandolfo's in Tempe. Nope. It was nowhere near as good as either restaurant.  It was just okay. The bread had a slight toughness like it was day old bread. The meat was chewy and lacking flavor. The coleslaw was really good and had the perfect crunch. The flavor of the coleslaw was not strong, but still masked the flavor of the pastrami. I will stick with Jason's or Heidi's next time I have a hankerin' for another deli style sandwich."}
