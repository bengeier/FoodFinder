{"text":"Stopped by to pick up a bowl of wonton soup with noddles and pork for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised by the freshness, taste and portion. Also has a nice atmosphere with great music playing. Much needed establishment and concept in Tremont!!"}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite place to eat. I had the large Poke bowl, which is almost too much food with the complimentary miso soup. You can choose your \"proteins\" and then it's full on with the sides! I had the large bowl with sticky white rice, salmon, spicy tuna and regular tuna. Mix in some spicy seaweed, avocado, edamame and their house sauce, it was a meal to die for!
Lots of choices there to mix in with your poke bowl. It's definitely a \"fusion\" of sorts. Well worth the $14. I will absolutely be back!!"}
{"text":"Alas, the Build-a-Poke-Bowl workshop has arrived in Cleveland!

Located on the corner of 11th St and Kenilworth Ave, Corner 11 is a colorful addition to Tremont with its Hawaiian (and Thai) flavors accompanied with sweet beach music vibes. 

Some cool highlights:

1. All sauces are made from scratch. Feeling like something unique? Try out the Green Curry!
2. Unlimited toppings! If you want to spice up your life, try out the spicy (red) seaweed salad and then neutralize back to baseline with some fresh avocado.
3. Favorite dessert: Sweet sticky rice topped with mango. This is a classic Thai dessert, and they deliver this wonderfully, with coconut undertones.
4. Did you know you can make biodegradable utensils out of corn starch? Check out the utensil counter for some cool forks, spoons, and soup spoons. Yes, you can have your sustainability and compost it too!

While Poke is definitely the centerpiece of this new restaurant, I also highly recommend trying some of the Thai dishes on the menu - particular the Kao Moo Daang (Rice with Pork and Cucumbers, with a special sweet red sauce) - simply delicious. The owners say they may also be trying out new specials for their menu, and I hope that means a Kao Man Gai (Seasoned Rice and Chicken dish with a special garlic sauce) may be in store for the near future. In the meantime, OK Poke!"}
{"text":"Super fresh poke bowls!!! I'm also in looove with the curry noodle salad! My fav go to spot now for quick lunches or dinners!!!  Fish is fresh and if you love sushi you will love this place! Think of it as a sushi salad!!! Mmmmm ... drool.."}
{"text":"A large assortment of fresh ingredients. Many fun and unique sauces to choose from to put on top of your sashimi and rice. We also tried the miso soup and Thai pork and shrimp dumplings. An excellent new fast-casual corner spot!"}
{"text":"When all you need is a hot plate of delicious and healthy food, Corner 11 is calling you! Very vegan/veggie friendly! More on that below...
Located across from the lovely Lincoln Park - with a nice front patio as an option for outdoor enthusiasts - this location is in the heart of Tremont, which is great! The interior is warm and bright, with a cool eclectic vibe.
Now - the food.
DELICIOUS! I saw the Vegan Soup on the menu so came in to try that ... the kind server suggested I also try the VEGAN FRESH NOODLE dish. I was open to it, and am so glad I tried it! The sautéed mixed mushrooms were very flavorful and had a great chew to them. The carrot was a nice touch. LOVED the fresh rice noodle! It was perfectly cooked. The sweet and sour black sauce is a good pair for the dish, but I wish I didn't use most of the container. A little goes a long way! There was also a little salad underneath the noodle - not mentioned in the menu - this was a surprising addition, but it paired well.
Now - the Vegan Soup - this is NOT located on their website (https://corner11cleveland.com/menu) menu as far as I can tell ... but I saw it on Google, which is what attracted me to visit in the first place. The broth was just lovely ... the chinese cabbage was cooked well, the carrot had a nice crunch, and the TOFU! My goodness - it was perfectly cooked! A light fry on the outside, and wonderful melt-in-your-mouth on the inside. 

Definitely coming back here again soon! :-p"}
{"text":"A-OKAY POKE! Enjoyed a fantastic, refreshing, and surprisingly filling lunch...

I got the small salmon bowl with white rice, veggies, and Tom Yum sauce (sweet, ever-so-slightly spicy and coconut-y) and will surely come again for more of this dish!Gyoza was perfectly cooked, and miso soup was flavorful and robust.  Thai tea was also strong and sweet, just like I like it to be!

Service was informational and super friendly. Atmosphere: Clean, chic, casual and the patio just gave me such good vibes (like I wanted to sit there and watch the corner from the windows all day!) 

Constructive criticisms and cons:
Prices were a bit steep, and not comparable to other fast-casual pricing, yet not surprising for the location (Tremont area). 

As mentioned in other reviews, Boba in tea was a little hard, could have been cooked longer to be softer and squishy (is squishy even a real word?)

In any case, I would like to see this ma and pa succeed and thrive and will do my part to support this tasty new addition in Tremont!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at eating a Poke Bowl. I have had something similar in the korean culture style of food. I can say i wasnt dissappointed after eating at this location. I had chicken and fried tofu which made for a delicious combo. The boba in the tea was awful and hard but the thai coffee was delicious. I was able to try the cheese crab sticks which were amazing and earned this review a star on its own. I think that they were a bit over priced for only 2 of them. If coming to this location again i will for sure be having them again. The midnight rice was unusual and delicious all at the same time. 

I feel like they added too much rice to compensate for the lack of veggies. Even if you mix the food well you find yourself lacking substance when the only thing left is rice. Its a bit on the medium price range. Other places offer something similar for less. All and all its a cute shop at a home-like location."}
{"text":"This is, by far, my new favorite place to grab a quick dinner on a busy night after a workout! I was at first drawn to Corner 11 as I'm a vegetarian & they have tofu as a protein option...Though now it is the taste that will also bring me back! The black rice and Teriyaki sauce were both delicious new options! Great addition to Tremont!"}
{"text":"If you're tired of chipotle bowls come check this place out!! You create your own bowl and you have a different variety of proteins to choose from and wonderful sides! Reminds me of bibibop but I think this is better! Definitely coming back again, even if it's just for the guava juice!!"}
{"text":"A great new addition to Tremont with friendly owners and fresh food served in a beautiful spot! I've eaten here seven or so times in the past couple months and will return even more throughout the summer months to enjoy their outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"Exotic blend of premium topping allowing for the bowl to be different every time. Hawaii infused Thai food which loads flavor all the way from the homeland. For me I enjoyed a spicy tuna, salmon, and tofu poke bowl. Topped with jalapeno, cilantro, lime, ginger, wasabi  tobiko,  wasabi and topped with a spicy sauce which packs a slight spice that's doesn't over power the bowl. For a large bowl purchase; miso soup is provided at no extra charge. The soup is a hidden gem that some may never get to try! For the daring purchase a homemade drink. The pink guava juice is a go to for me and I would recommend it to anyone. Overall a great experience and a must eat. Hawaii-Thai infusion at its best."}
{"text":"I am proud to have this place be my 200th review on Yelp! 

A bowl of magic. That is what you get at Corner 11. I have had this place bookmarked for a while and FINALLY got the chance to come and see what everyone had been raving about! It is well deserving of the star rating it has.

What an adorable little restaurant. This little corner joint has an awesome vibe. Laid back, earthy and eclectic. Just the way I like it. The patio is beautiful and has a great view of the cute little community around you.

Fresh, flavorful and friendly. The 3 F's that make this place awesome. Lots of ingredients to top your bowl with...from avocado to kimchi to cucumbers. White and black rice too, which I thought was totally awesome! Their fish is fresh and their meat is flavorful. I loved the spicy salmon!!!!! The broth for their soup could use a little more flavor, but their dumplings are to die for. 

The downsides? Not many. The parking here is hairy (not as bad as my legs though) and the portion sizes could use an upgrade. Supersize me. 

I WILL BE BACK CORNER 11!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while because every time I walk by I see people sitting outside with delicious looking poke bowls. We tried it out tonight & had a great experience. The bowls were as delicious as they looked. The customer service was great and super friendly. We enjoyed sitting outside near the park."}
{"text":"Just so good!!  Traveled from Akron to try this new place, and we will definitely be back!  Poke bowls so fresh! Curry noodle soup was to die for! 
Super cute atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for poke!! My friend ordered the curry noodle soup which was delicious too!"}
{"text":"Okay, second time here. We chose the Vegan Curry Noodle soup (Kao-Soi) & the Pink Noodle soup (Yen-Ta-Fo).  Such good flavors!  Nothing disappoints here so far at Corner 11.  Still more to try next time! Soup is sooooo good on a cold, rainy night."}
{"text":"This is excellent poké. Better than the downtown place. Husband went to a place in Seattle for poké and felt this restaurant was even better."}
{"text":"Having tried the Poke Bowl craze while on vacation in Salt Lake; I was excited to see that Cleveland is getting in on the trend with Corner 11 in Tremont.  I went over after work on a Wednesday night at about 8pm.  Corner 11 is located at the corner of West 11th and Kenilworth across from Lincoln Park next to Merchant Street Provision.  Located in a converted house Corner 11 presents a couple of glowing windows to the dark night to greet you as you walk in.

Still in the soft opening, Corner 11 has a warm and friendly feel; a bunch of small tables sit in front of the counter with the Poke items and an electronic menu board.  For those who haven't encountered it before, Poke is a Hawaiian food that is similar to a bowl of sushi items.  Chopped protein is put on top of rice with side items and then topped with sauce.  Corner 11 gives you a choice of 3 size bowls, I got the medium which comes with a choice of 2 proteins, over a base of forbidden rice and salad, topped with almost all of the toppings and the spicy seafood sauce and spicy mayo.  You talk them through the assembly of your bowl similar to going through the line at Chipoltle.  The result is a beautiful bowl of food and it should brighten your day unless you are a person who needs a divided plate to keep all of your items separated.

The forbidden black rice adds a nice bit of crunch and body to the bowl.  I tried the raw tuna and the scallops as my proteins.  Both were very high quality and fresh.   The tastes were clean and simple, just what you want from the seafood.  The other protein choices are raw salmon, shrimp, tofu and chicken.  The toppings add different textures flavors and contrasts to the bowl; I especially liked the sesame kick of the seaweed salad, the punch of the kim chee, the salty kick of the fish roe and the creaminess of the avocado.   The sauces help to bring everything together and provide a good amount of spicy heat without burning out your taste buds.  Overall the bowl was great, with plenty of different textures and flavors, you will get some salty bites, some sweet bites and it did a great job of filling me up without being heavy.

Service was very friendly and informative, I talked to the owners and they certainly bring commitment and passion.  Corner 11 also has a nice sized menu of appetizers, soups and noodles, with what looks like some interesting Asian fusion flavors.  During the soft opening they are giving you unlimited toppings so it is well worth a visit now.  Poke bowls are becoming popular around the country and Corner 11 does a great job with this trend; the proteins were very high quality, the toppings were all fresh and the sauces have nice punch and were all made in house.  If you want to catch the latest food craze get to Tremont and give them a try."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! I'm a huge poke fan and I eat it all the time on the west coast, so I was thrilled to see a poke place open here. The mango sticky rice was perfect, the fish was fresh and so was the rice and toppings, and the sauces were good. My only complaint is no furikake which is something I love on poke."}
{"text":"I welcome  this new addition to the raw fish scene(and cooked), CLE is officially hipster . Best poke bowl in Cleveland hands down. 

Let's just start with walking in. I was immediately warmly great and the owner inquired if this was my 1st time visiting. They explained the concept with a ton 'o' enthusiasm.  It's design your own poke bowl. I think the future of  fast food maybe heading towards this concept. Fresh ingredient prepared to your gusto.  All of the poke sauces were homemade and excellent, they will let you sample them.

I ordered the medium bowl with yellow fin and salmon,  it was around 11$ it was a really nice portion. They let me pile on the fresh vegtables as well. The fish was very fresh and of  excellent quality.

I really felt like my business was appreciated. This establishment is for sure going to feed my poke addiction.

This joint is everything a mom and pop restaurant shoud strive to be"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience! Food and service were fantastic. We tried a small poke bowl with spicy tuna, classic gyoza, and kao soi noddle soup. Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times in the last week. Such a welcome addition to the neighborhood and the Cleveland dining scene. Food is super fresh, exactly what you'd expect from poke, and the owners/staff are very friendly and helpful. Priced very reasonably and love the variety of toppings and sauces."}
{"text":"A poke place that I don't have to drive like 25 minutes to, very nice!
I came here after perusing the reviews, not because I was debating going (I was definitely going) but I found out that all of this month they had a promotion where you can get unlimited toppings which is just a fantastic idea for a new place.

As such, I fully took advantage. I got the black rice (which was very lovely), tuna and scallops. On top of that I grabbed cucumbers, carrots, avocado, seaweed salad, mango, kimchi, green onions and tobiko. I got teriyaki sauce and creamy tom-yum on the side and I think that was a good choice because my friend's bowl had a lot of sauce put on it. 

The bowl was packed full, the seafood tasted pretty fresh and it was just a nice poke bowl. We sat at their window and just ate while chatting. There was loads of room to sit down and eat so not to worry about that. Parking might be a bit of a pain on the weekends but if the weather is warmer then it's not too bad if you can walk it, walking is good for you. 

Overall it's a great addition to Tremont!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for a delicious poke bowl. Super unassuming and friendly service, fresh ingredients and great value!  I'll totally be back."}
{"text":"Small quaint place. Signature soup was very good if you like mild curry. Poke selection was great would've liked to have seen octopus."}
{"text":"Salmon bowl was amazing! All of the toppings are so fresh and created with care highly recommend!"}
{"text":"POKE IS HERE AND I AM HERE FOR IT! What a cool place. I wasn't sure what to expect as I've never had much poke around the CLE, but I loved this spot. It's in Tremont, so be prepared to be patient when looking for street parking.

Alexia, the manager, was super helpful. She walked me through the process. Pick your size (small, medium, large), base (white rice, lettuce), protein(s) (tofu, tuna, chicken, salmon, oysters, shrimp), and choice of dressing. I ordered a medium bowl with white rice, shrimp/scallops, edamame, cucumber, seaweed salad, mango, and kimchi. I got the green curry and yum yum sauces on the side. To my surprise, they ended up being pretty tasty when mixed together in the bowl (likely the mix of spicy and mild). The medium was MORE than enough food and I loved every bite.

The bowl was supeeeerrrrr satisfying. It was fresh, colorful and took my mind off the carby lunch I had that I later hated myself for. The inside of the restaurant is super cute with comfortable chairs, a good atmosphere and bright lights both inside and outside (cute Christmas lights on the bushes). The staff seemed like they genuinely care about what they do, and if you live in the neighborhood, you get a 10% discount! What great people and great food. I'll be back all the time."}
{"text":"I only review when I'm really happy. This was one of those rear occasions. Simple, fresh, healthy and delicious. I got a large bowl comes with 3 proteins and a cup of miso. Eyes way bigger than my stomach. Can't wait to return. Visit this gem. Give them your business. We need theses types of places."}
{"text":"What a welcome arrival Corner 11 is in Tremont! This place opened somewhat suddenly in a vacant space that was most recently home to the short-lived Merchant Street Provisions quick-stop market (the Merchant Street restaurant still thrives next door). There aren't currently many lunch options in Tremont, which is in part, I suspect, because there aren't a lot of businesspeople working here during the daytime - but which I hope doesn't mean there's no room for one, because this place is GOOD, & I'd like to see it succeed.

On my first visit, just a day after their soft opening, I ordered a small poke bowl (they have three sizes), which comes with one protein. With (requested) input from an employee, I chose shrimp on a bed of greens (white & midnight rice are also available), topped with mango, cucumber, carrots, & avocado. From their sauce bar (about 10 sauce options, a few homemade), I chose a tangy tom yum sauce, then topped my bowl with their freebies, sesame seeds & crispy wonton strips. Yes, this is an Asian Chipotle-style set-up - but it's a million times more delicious, & it tastes so fresh. I scarfed down my salad, but not before I sent a photo of it to at least four people to tell them they need to try Corner 11.

For $5, I also ordered three steam buns with red bean filling (custard & black sesame also available, & you can mix them up). They surprised me by showing up in the shape of little hedgehogs - so cute! The guy working the front, named Sam, also brought me a small sample cup of their signature curry soup, which I'm going to have to order a bowl of. It was incredibly flavorful.

Corner 11 also offers a variety of beverages, including Thai tea, which I'll try next time. This time, I just got water, orange-infused, which is complimentary. A nice touch. 

Needless to say, as long as Corner 11 exists & I live in Tremont, it'll be my daytime lunch go-to. I can't recommend it highly enough, even after only one visit!"}
{"text":"Cleveland's 1st true poke place.  Bowls were excellent fish was fresh and service was great."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch in Tremont. Do not pass up the chicken curry soup! Tip: Dining with more than one person? Order your soup and poke but don't get your poke bowl filled until your soup comes out. Then you can all eat together! Win-win!"}
{"text":"This is the healthy one i am looking for. Many choices of protein (tuna, salmon, chicken,etc) and also fresh vegetables (avocado, mango, tomatoes,etc). I really love the way this place moves on the reasonable price and nice service. I'll be back"}
{"text":"I hated getting inside the building. As wise Ciara once sang \"LET ME SEE YOU 1, 2 STEP\". Steps are a bitch. Also, I wasn't too into the demeanor of the woman taking our order. The guy was fine, but she came off as... yikes. No words. The place also smelled like an old house. Probably because it is an old house though. 

Honestly those are the only three reasons I took off a star! The food is stellar, five stars!!! It's the next day now and I'm still thinking about the curry noodle soup. We ordered the two protein poke bowl. The toppings were actually unlimited, so I wouldn't trust the menu. Oh, and I would not order the steam buns again. They taste like something I would heat up from the freezer.

I will be back, not go inside but to go to their outdoor seating. It's in Tremont... Maybe it will be dog friendly?"}
{"text":"Good quality fish, good assortment of toppings. but $15 for a rather standard size (large) I think is just ridiculous. my dish was rather salty too and I didn't even get any sauce. in fact my mom and I were actually still hungry after our not cheap meal ($28 for two of us) so went and got sushi downtown directly after. food is good but definitely not worth the price"}
{"text":"I just got food here like two hours ago. The food looks like Bibibop in University Circle, your typical Asian Chipotle bowl style place, though this is poke so the choices of protein are raw seafood. The bowl ordering process is somewhat confusing and for the price I can't believe they limit the number of \"sides\" (meaning vegetables aside from the protein) unless you want to pay another $2 on top of the already steep prices. I had the curry soup as well which smelled good and the broth was flavorful but is pretty much just broth, noodles and meat. No vegetables, aside from two or three pickled somethings. Would give it a 6/10.
Now the best part, two hours later I have a sore stomach and torrential diarrhea. Thanks raw scallops! Cool  Would not return."}
{"text":"Just went for my first time and loved it. So glad the poke trend is finally making its way to cleveland! Food was very fresh with lots of great toppings. And the sushi rice was perfect. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Super delicious asian food.  Loved the beef terriyaki plate and chicken curry noodle soup.  Don't miss this gem in the Tremont neighborhood."}
{"text":"I found this place at the Cleveland Asian Festival. It is just wonderful. All the food is very fresh and their location was very clean. I hope to visit their restaurant soon."}
{"text":"I just discovered this little Tremont gem, what a wonderful little spot!  The staff is really nice and the food is terrific!  I had the chicken curry soup, nice blend of flavors and textures, large portions.  Their bowls are wonderful and fun to create, pick out whatever you want to add.  Prices are really good.  Great for lunch or casual dinner"}
{"text":"For a first time Poke-trier. This was an amazing experience! I got the spicy tuna bowl and was impressed w the unlimited sides I could add on. Food was on point!"}
{"text":"Being from Hawaiian decent, I was pleasantly surprised on a quality poke bowl shop that popped up in tremont. Asian fusion food in a laid back tremont culture environment. Great for lunch! Really enjoyed myself and  will come again! 

Ps
When ordering the poke bowl I really liked the spicy seaweed and spicy tuna options"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and I love this place. Tremont needed Corner 11 so bad. It's quick, delicious and right on the park. The atmosphere is nice to eat inside or outside or I get them to go for home or at a bench in the park. The Poke bowls are fantastic and everything else I've had is good, I just like the bowls so much I always get them. The owners are great too. If there is a line, you could be waiting a bit, but it's not so bad as they take their time with each order. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"So filling and healthy.  Awesome place and great for quick take outs too.  Awesome veggie dumplings! Going here every week!"}
{"text":"I went here on a saturday hot afternoon for lunch. I wanted something healthy and refreshing. The place had few table area, window seating and nice decor inside. Soon as I walked in we were greeted and asked what I wanted. Since this was my first time being here I wanted to look over the menu to see what options they had. They are known for their poke bowl station but I wanted to try other things as well. I started with Sai-Oua which is their sausage made with pork and thai herbs and their Ka-Nom-Jeeb which is their thai dumplings. The sausage was my favorite because it had alot of flavor and spice to it but didn't taste really fatty. The thai dumplings were much smaller and it was just alright to me. For dinner I got the poke bowl with spicy tuna and their Kao-Soi chicken which is there thai egg curry soup. The poke bowl was refreshing and everything seemed fresh from the tuna, to the ginger, and I feel in love with their spicy sauce that comes as an option .I was very surprised by the thai egg curry soup. The flavor was so delicious ! I definitely will be coming back here for lunch for more options."}
{"text":"I will start off with saying that I have only had Poke one time and wasn't sure if I liked it however after having it here I can say for sure that I love it! My boyfriend and I tried a variety of dishes here just so we could have a taste of it all. The wonton soup was incredible and the first time I've had such great homemade wonton with the broth. The owner told me the broth was made with pork bones and you could taste that it had been slowly cooking all day. This is my new place for wonton soup for sure! My second favorite dish is the thai dumplings. They are pork and shrimp stuffed in delicate wrappers. The thai spices really come through and they are full of flavor. I would buy one portion for yourself because you won't want to share these. You can customize your Poke bowl with different toppings based on the size you get and it was surprisingly filling. The last thing we tried was the bbq pork steam buns and it really felt like you were eating pillows! The dough was super soft and sweet and it melted in your mouth. We plan on coming back here soon to try all the other dishes they have to offer."}
{"text":"I Had the first official wrap made at Corner 11 ! I told the young Lady to be creative!  Mind blowing creation!  A must try!"}
{"text":"Corner 11 is a great addition to Tremont! I found this new restaurant on Yelp and had to check it out. I came on a weekday so street parking wasn't too difficult to find. While I was there people kept coming in so I assume that this place is already gaining plenty of hype.

For the month of March unlimited sides are free so my poke bowl was stuffed. Trust me, they do not skimp out on the toppings. My small bowl, which included midnight rice, shrimp, spicy mayo and assorted veggies, was enough to make me full. My boyfriend ordered the Thai stix appetizer which was tasty and similar to crab rangoon. The portion was really small however and not worth the price unless they add at least 1 more roll or add more filling. The pink milk drink, made from condensed milk and sala syrup is a must get! It is very sweet and tastes a little like strawberry but not quite.

Come here if you want to see what the latest poke bowl craze is all about! You'll be satisfied."}
