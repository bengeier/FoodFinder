{"text":"I go so often that they now recognize me. There is another frozen yogurt place closer to my house but this place is worth the little extra walk. It's yummy, not too expensive and it had a great selection the changes often. I love this place and go biweekly. The jumba juice is also nice. The place down the street feels small, crowded and is nearly always filled with children. I like not having to sit next to a family of 5 kids while eating. This place has more seating area so I can normally find a quiet place."}
{"text":"Their yogurt is good.  But overall I just really thought it was just way too expensive for what you get.  Price is just ridiculous."}
{"text":"On their grand opening and so, they handed up samplers and coupons for their new Yogurty location on the Danforth. And since I haven't had frozen yoghurt in a long time, I decided to try this place out. 

The place was also mixed in with Jambo Juice, literally in the same place and at first was quite confusing. However I also did not realize this was a self-serve place and awkwardly stare at the selection of yoghurt. 

Anyways, I chose the red velvet flavour and did not try to mix in others. For the toppings, there is a vast selection of fruits, chocolates and candies to mix into your yoghurt. I really did not go creative on my red velvet, instead I just picked nerds candy and white chocolate. 

Since its self-serve, the pricing of frozen yoghurt dictates on the weight of how many toppings and yoghurt, you add in on a weight scale. And since I did not add much to it, it was $2.50. 

The red velvet actually complimented the two weird combinations that I picked, I really love nerds candy and mixing it with white chocolate was a great combination. 

P.S. I did not like the hipster working at the place."}
{"text":"This location has a Jamba Juice! Happiest girl alive? I think so. Other than that, it's a pretty standard froyo joint. 

The only tiff that I have with this place is the people working there. There's one woman who works that that will often be talking on her headset while she's serving you and there are a bunch of high school kids that are super angsty and not as chipper as the high schoolers that work at Menchies down the street. Other than that, it's just alright."}
{"text":"Really nice place. Good quality for reasonable price.
They do have electric outlets to charge your phone LOL :D"}
{"text":"I love Jamba Juice and hate that it has succumbed to its competitors in many of its locations. Therefore, you can understand my excitement when I passed one on the Danforth. However, my experience here did not meet the standards I'm used to at JJ.

Firstly, they've made their smoothies smaller so I didn't get enough IMO and the costs have increased. Their menu appears to have shrunk but they are trying to experiment by offering new menu options such as smoothies incorporating Kale.

Anyway, today I went to my go-to favourite menu item of 'peach perfection' and it tasted delicious but it wasn't blended well enough and I kept getting large pieces of frozen fruit stuck in the straw. A personal pet peeve of mine is large things that need to be chewed in a drink. 

Overall, this place just squeaked by as a place where I would return. I miss the options, the large drinks, and hate that it wasn't blended well enough.

On the other hand considering there aren't many outlets in the GTA, I may return next time I have a smoothie craving."}
{"text":"I like that Yogurty's is Canadian. I like that it's self serve. I like that there are flavour options. However I gave them a three star because some flavours are hit and miss. Sometimes their yogurt is a bit runny and not as frozen as I like it. Sometimes their flavours taste like canned stuff (such as pineapple) as opposed to fresh fruit (which their competitor does a really good take on the pineapple). Anyways, they have good topping options and their price is competitive."}
{"text":"This location, like a few others in the GTA, also has a Jamba Juice along for the ride. I wanted a post-workout smoothie so I came in here to try their protein option. Now I know it wasn't going to be the best option in the world, but I also wanted something a little sweet. This smoothie hit the spot. It was tasty and filled me up. For around $7 for the Original size, they're not cheap, but its still cheaper than me going out and buying a blender for the rare occasion that I want a smoothie."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a semi-healthy treat :)  The selection is awesome in the self-serve frozen yogurt, the topping abound and the kids will love it.  This is the ultimate in customizable desert treat and you can enjoy a little or a lot.  It does come at a price so be prepared to spend some cash to enjoy this treat, hense only 4 stars."}
