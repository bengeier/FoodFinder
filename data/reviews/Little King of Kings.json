{"text":"Usually whole in the wall places are good so I figured give this place a try.   I ordered Kung Pow Chicken and it was ok, really tastes like teriyaki chicken so I had to add hot sauce to give it that spice, flavors were ok too.  It came it with egg roll & a drink for little over $5.   The staff was nice that's why I have it a 2 star but will I go back again, I don't think so."}
{"text":"This place is a good little hideout. The food is great and you are quickly helped and served. They have more than chinease food. They also have a killer burger and fries. The chicken teriyaki bowl is so good and a favorite"}
{"text":"Cheap plenty of food and delicious, with very friendly staff. Would definitely refer friends and family."}
{"text":"Great value for your money.  It is a mix of Americanized Chinese food and a sushi bar.  I ordered the Little King of Kings special and was very pleased-- so much chicken for $5.  They also have great deals on rice bowls for $2.99.  You can dine in or take-out.  If you are a person who is easily scared you may want to have a friend with you when you visit this Van Buren restaurant.  I want to go back and try the sushi!"}
