{"text":"A cute place to lounge and relax in with your friends.  It's comfortable and neat.  I've been here two to three times now and I've always sat on the couches with the big coffee tables.    + Oh and I asked for water once and they pointed me to the little water cooler table near the door.  I didn't really mind getting up to pour myself water but just something I wanted to point out.  It's a bit pricy but this is the only reason I come back here:  The chocolate waffles are heavenly.  Also, the heart post-it message board is really cute.  I remember writing messages with my friends on there back when I was in high school."}
{"text":"Very cute and comfortable place to relax and hang out. You can break out a board game or your laptop as well. There is a 2-hour sitting limit which is reasonable. I came here on a Saturday afternoon and it was comfortably empty."}
{"text":"Really nice and comfortable place just to relax and chill out to enjoy some good sweets. Love the atmosphere and 9 times out of 10 the customer service is very kind. I come here often when I'm down at finch and never fail to order their incredible smoothies or waffle sandwiches. Don't even get me started on the cakes! It is a little pricey but it's the same for most cafés like this on finch anyways."}
{"text":"This cute shop is located at the second floor of a korean restaurant ! I really enjoy the environment here, although i think they should clean up there shop a little more.  some of the things are a little over priced."}
{"text":"The workers don't wash their hands. The kitchen is not ventilated and the reuse the same rag to clean the plates and the tables  The owner is a whole different story. She is very hard to talk to, barely speaks any English and the entire staff is underage.  Beware of the fat waitress who looks like a pig. You can tell by her muffin top and her turned up nose, she will spit in your food."}
{"text":"They just had a 2-hour limit to sit huhu. But it was good. Had their icecream and some hot drinks. Wasn't that bad.  it was just far."}
{"text":"I went there on a Sunday afternoon with a friend. When I read the reviews and saw some pics I was a bit afraid it would be a bit snobby (because of the name and the décor which reminds me of a typical British tea salon!lol). But in fact nothing snobby, it is just a way to enjoy yummy giant cake slices, huge scoops, bubble teas and cafes at a very reasonable price while lying on the comfy couch :-) You feel like being at home. The dominant colors are white and pink, which is very girly, so when I saw couples, or just guys hanging out with girls I was wondering if they were feeling comfortable!lol Anyway it does not matter, you go there to eat, drink and talk/laugh with the person who is with you right? lol  My friend and I ordered a dessert plate to share (you choose your cake slices and scoops flavours, and you get fresh fruits). We did not finish it all, the portion was too big (see the pic I posted ;-)).  Will go there but the thing is, it is located up North, fortunately it is nearby Finch station."}
{"text":"A decent enough place if you have money to burn; like most I found the food overpriced for its quality. I ordered the parfait and a cold tea, which added up to $15 without tip. For $15 in a lot of places I can get a full meal, not just a snack. The atmosphere is alright but I personally didn't find it anything special. The service was alright - quick, but not particularly friendly. It's a nice enough place to lounge on sofas and chat with friends, but I still think the prices are too high."}
{"text":"Staff is terrible!  They don't pay attention to any tables and you can be sitting there for 2 hours without anyone coming over to check if you need anything.  At least the dessert here is good. We had the green tea waffle.  Milkshakes are just ok, too much ice."}
{"text":"Their date tea is my favourite. The chocolate cake is really good too. The grean tea waffle is decent. Great spot to hang out with friends. They have board games but they charge $5 for the game on your bill."}
{"text":"decorations are cute, the whole theme idea is great, but the drinks and food were just so so. Feel it's little over priced."}
{"text":"Overall, a great experience. It feels like being in a Korean drama. The location, decor and menu items fit the Café Princess theme.   You go up stairs to the cafe and are greeted by friendly staff. The menus are a little worn out but still cute. Café Princess serves milkshakes, smoothies, italian sodas, as well as hot and cold bubble tea, coffee, espresso, and tea drinks. For dessert, they serve a variety of cakes, ice cream, sundaes and waffles.   What we ordered and our thoughts:   Large Kiwi Green Tea with tapioca - not the best bubble tea we've had  Small Pineapple Green Tea - also not the best (We found that even though it was flavoured it was still bland)   Caffé Latté - very well done. It was presented with a chocolate web design in the foam which added the right amount of sweetness to the drink.   Chocolate mousse cake - good but store bought.  All of their cakes can be bought from a grocery store. Each slice of cake was $4-$5.   Green tea waffles - AMAZING! The waffles had matcha mixed into the batter which made these fresh waffles evem better. Condensed milk was poured onto the waffles and there was green tea ice cream on the side. Absolutely worth the price and great to split between 2 people.   In total we paid $35 for the three of us.   Things worth mentioning:  1. You must pay for parking. Parking is located behind the building (off of Finch). We paid $4 for \"All Day Saturday\".  2. There are two washrooms. One for men, one for women. The decor and paintings inside go very well with the theme. Cute, and girly.  3. Board games are an extra $2.50 per game. There are decks of cards but we believe these are included in the $2.50 charge.  4. The couches are COMFY! Great for lounging.  5. Wifi is free 6. Staff are friendly"}
{"text":"Cute date idea or tea time with the girls, their baked goods are nothing special...what you would find at second cup..perhaps the waffles are more different but a bit overpriced in my opinion unless you are splitting the bill. On plus side if you are a k pop fan or k drama addict this a cute cafe that plays kpop and has that kdrama abeyance you see in movies with cafes."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really cute and girly however the washrooms were filthy and almost looked like there were rat droppings. I didn't take a closer look to see if it was or not. The waitress didnt really give off a friendly vibe but Im not sure if it was the communication barrier as she wasn't very fluent in English. As for parking you have to park behind shoppers drug mart or you can park for free on the street after 10 pm. Drinks were decent. I ordered a cold drink and although it came with ice cubes it still ended up being lukewarm."}
{"text":"Drinks are pretty good, food is alright. Environment is lovely for friends gathering or couples."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of nights ago for desert.  I don't live in Toronto but I'm visiting my parents for the holidays.  I had their hot citric green tea and a green tea ice-cream with waffles.  The drink was nothing special, but I'm quite impressed by the desert.  It came with 2 large scopes of green tea ice-cream and 4 pieces of waffles (maybe just 3, I forgot).  It was huge!  But to my surprise, I could finish it just fine.  Even though they put cream on, the cream was light.  So even though I finish all of them, my stomach didn't feel stuffed.  Other commenters mentioned that the place is a bit feminine and I agree.  It does remind me of those cafes in Akihabara, Tokyo, even though the waitresses dress normally, and it's definitely not a manga/anime cafes.  It doesn't bother me though.  I wish I could sit by the window, read my books while watching the busy Yonge Street flowing beneath me.  Lastly, it's a bit expensive as I paid around CAD16 for my 2 desert items.  I'll definitely try their sweet potato latte next time, as I didn't know it's their popular drink until I came here and read others' comments."}
{"text":"I walked in here expecting a boring cafe with the typical decor, but I was wrong. After I walked in I started to smile because it was so pretty inside. It's definitely a good place to chat and hang out with friends. The good thing about this place is that you don't have to order at the counter."}
{"text":"Very good cafe. Awesome location and great food. The interior is very nice and cozy. Once you sit you dont wanna leave. Not to mention that the waitress are super nice. Must visit."}
{"text":"You basically come here for its cute décor. The desserts are okay, but definitely overpriced. I do not like their drinks though, the ones I've tried tasted weird or too sugary."}
{"text":"I like Cafe Princess because it's a convenient location and is really cute for meeting up with friends for a latte and some waffles.  I've had their sweet potato latte, hazelnut hot chocolate, chocolate chip waffle, chocolate waffle, and a variety of cakes. The drinks and waffles have always been on point, but the cakes are passable - ridiculously expensive for the tiny slices they give you, especially when you can buy the whole cake at Loblaws for double the price of one slice here (they're all La Rocca cakes).   I will also ditto some previous reviews and agree that some of the furniture could use a bit of a cleaning or reupholstering (or just plain replacing) and that I too had my fair share of awkward experiences being seated near some hot-and-heavy couples. I'm all for young love, but a cafe's couch should not be where you try to get to second base because you and your boyfriend still live at home with mom & pop...just saying. Also, the teddy bears in the window have to go."}
{"text":"This cafe is hidden among the million asian restaurants and stores on Yonge. It's a cute place if you're into girly themes (Hello Kitty, stuffed animals, pink decor, flowers...) It has a very relaxing and intimate feeling to the place. I got the mango smoothie but it wasn't much of a smoothie. It was definitely milky so I'd say it was more of a milkshake. However, it was delicious! It's a good place to go with your girlfriends for some drinks and dessert."}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: All menu items were slightly overpriced for the portion size.  A slice of cake was around $6. I ordered a waffle sandwich which was basically a waffle with apple jam inside folded in half.  It cost about $6.  Regular drinks were good and typical of any bubble tea place. I ordered a caramel macchiato though which tasted great and had a lovely design on it.  Facility: I loved the ambiance of the cafe.  It is very cozy, dimly lit and girly.  Despite this were were SEVERAL groups of only boy/guys/men hanging out here. Location is small, decor is nice.  Even when there is a lot of customers, it was never too loud. Music was slightly too loud (probably why everyone else was quiet). We stayed there for quite a bit and noticed the music looping constantly. Washroom isn't good, useable, but not good. The unit is located upstairs to another store (hard to find/or see). There is street parking which is good if you can get it, or paid Green P parking in the back.   Service: Service was okay. They did their job but certainly didn't go above or beyond.  Overall: Cafe Princess is exactly what it sounds like. Girly, romantic, and warm. The food and drinks are not enough to attract me again but the ambiance is good for \"catching up with the girls\". I would return if my girlfriends want to come back, but I don't think I would seek to make Cafe Princess a destination on my own."}
{"text":"A nice and quiet café that caught me off guard when I first stepped in. It honestly looked like I had come into someone's apartment. The decor has a comfortable and somewhat \"homey\" feel to it, which is a nice change compared to the coffee shops everywhere else.   Seems like it could be a good place to study or get lost in a book. Very laid back and you don't feel rushed. I'm in the Yonge/Finch area somewhat often so this was a good find, and a place I'll consider visiting again.   (My wife recommends the cakes here, though I didn't try any on this visit.)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about four years now, and nothing has changed. The drinks and snacks are good, albeit a little overpriced but it's worth it for the nice decor, comfortable seating, and good service. I usually only visit in the daytime (around 12pm-5pm) but I've heard it can get quite busy during weekend evenings. Try the moffle (mochi waffle), it's crispy and soft but never gets soggy because of the rice cake. Most of the cold drinks are also pretty good, my favourite are the milkshakes."}
{"text":"It's called Café Princess for a reason, with its very princessy décor, but even guys don't shy away from coming here. Service is okay, board game options for about $2, unlimited seating time, different seating options (I always go for the comfy couches), great choices on their menu (bubble tea, coffee & tea, lattés, waffles, ice cream, sandwiches, cake, etc...)  and their brand new sweet potato latte is a MUST, this place gets a 5-star rating instead of 4 specifically for their sweet potato latte! It's something you won't find easily elsewhere in Toronto.  Oh and I forgot to mention that they have wireless. EPIC WIN.  Just remember that this is a cute hangout place to unwind, more than it is a studying spot... If you need to get some serious work done, this is probably not the best place for you."}
{"text":"Cafe princess is quite interesting. It has couches to lounge on and comfortable chairs everywhere. There is enough room for groups or singles to lounge around. Many people where studying here or on their laptops. Although primarily an asian crowd I did see others here as well (including us). The environment makes you feel very welcome and the menu is quite different from what I've seen at other cafe's (this is my first asian oriented cafe that I have visited it). We tried the red tea latte ($4.99) and the fondue ($14.99). The red tea latte tasted like milk in tea (which is something I really like). The fondue was a platter of marshmallow's, fruit and cookies to dip into the chocolate. A great place to check out. It does not accept credit cards and we had to walk far to our car to get our debit card - just a warning to you in case you use credit cards often. Parking is on the side street (fully occupied when we got here) and there is more in the back area and up the street. It was fairly easy to get parking at 8pm on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"Love love loveee the atmosphere! I ordered a waffle with greentea and strawberry ice-cream. The ice-cream wasn't very flavorful and the presentation wasn't as good as i had expected. :("}
{"text":"If you're coming here for the food, you won't be impressed.  There is a wide selection of cakes, but they aren't worth the $7. I tried the sweet potato latte and liked it, but again, the sizes are tiny and probably won't last you the entire night.   I liked the environment though. I went on Christmas Eve and there were pretty decorations all around. It was pretty packed. You can play with their board games for $2.50, but cards are free. I think you can stay there for as long as you want though.  I would go back if I just want to chill with some friends, but if I'm looking for a good dessert place, this is not somewhere I'd go."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere and great service. Nice interior design and the couches are very comfortable which makes you feel at home. Variety of snacks, cakes and icecream. Great place to try different tea flavors and bubble teas."}
{"text":"The place itself is super cute and the quiet setting is perfect for a date night. The cakes that i've tried there are really rich in its ingredients & there are a lot of board games to play with while you're waiting for the food or if you are staying there to eat."}
{"text":"A really cute and cozy place that's a refreshing change from the other loud and noisy dessert/cafés in the area. There was a small stack of games in the corner for you to choose from and my friends had a ball playing Jenga.   I tried a jamoca almond cake with a scoop of green tea ice cream on the side. Cake was nice, but it didn't really have a coffee flavour to it. The green tea ice cream was delicious though. I also tried my friends' brownie cheesecake and green tea waffles, which were both delightful."}
{"text":"Went Friday afternoon, Quiet and friendly. Very girly deco Good wifi, real espresso, matcha also is really good, don't serve almond milk drink though... recommended to staff; otherwise will be 5 star for me :) overall very comfortable to spend some time with computer and coffee. 2 hr max sitting."}
{"text":"There were maggots in my crepe.............. Left on the spot. Never coming back. ... MAGGOTS... Seriously?!...."}
{"text":"1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3 Service: 4 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5  Extra information:  * Located on 2nd floor * Waffles & Cake slices avail * Free wifi  How can you just pass by a place called 'Cafe Princess' without checking it out? I am rarely in Finch & Yonge area so when I was, I decided to drop by and see what this place was all about. Even before I walked in, I knew it was a korean coffee shop. First of all, only Koreans would come up with such name for a coffee shop. And second, it is located at Finch & Yonge.  It is located on 2nd floor so you have to go up a flight of stairs. Once I walked in, I was immediately over-whelmed by asian(korean)'ess. It was filled with asians (surprisingly good mix of Korean, Chinese...etc) everywhere with couches hidden around the corner. They were def going for the intimate, girly and relaxing concept and it worked somewhat...with a touch of awkwardness. It might be because everything is so out in the open and if you are sitting on the couch, you can def hear the conversation that's happening behind you.  Their menu is quite extensive for a coffee shop- it's probably because they are trying to serve everything just like every other korean restaurant. They have coffee, specialty drinks (latte, mocha), slush, bubbletea, waffles, slice cakes, ice cream, parfait as well as sandwiches.   My friends and I decided to get the 'Princess Platter' which came with 2 choice of sliced cake with 2 scoops of icecream with fruits for $15.78. We got Strawberry Shortcake and Chocolate Mousse Cake with vanilla & greentea icecream. The platter is quite big so it's good for sharing 2~4 people if you are just here to share dessert.   Initially I thought $15.78 was quite expensive for a sharing dessert platter, but if you think about desserts that are around $10 at other restaurants as well as the portion size of the Princess platter- I think it's worth it at the end. Keep in mind that their cakes are not made in-house, and are purchased from La Rocca (which might be a good thing in this case since you know it will be consistent).  Normally I am not really into sweet potatoes- even when there was that crazy phase of yam fries everywhere, I stayed loyal to french fries. But since I was at Cafe Princess, I had to try their famous Sweet Potato Latte. It's basically milk with grinded up sweet potato in a cup.   It comes super hot so be careful when you drink it (I warned you)! I am glad I tried it but it was way too heavy for me and it felt like meal in a cup. If you've never tried it, I do recommend you give it at least one try.  I've been back couple more times after my first visit but basically always got the same Princess Platter (but with different choices of cake).  One thing I realized about this place after couple visit is that the overall atmosphere really varies from day to day. One day it'd be filled with young Korean couples...and another day it'd be filled with non-Korean highschool students...and another day it'd be filled with somewhat older crowd. Nontheless, I am not going to Cafe Princess for the crowd anyways but thought I would point that out.  Summary: I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this little korean coffee shop, but if you are in the area- drop by if interested in experiencing korean coffee shop (if you are lucky). Drinks are solid and cakes are decent- go for the experience, not amazing desserts and you will have yourself a good time."}
{"text":"Meh. That is how I describe my experience here. Came here on a Monday night with some friends and it was somewhat a disappointment. They were really strict on their rules. 2 hour sitting limit and everyone must order one item. But... What if you wanted to share? :( we noticed there weren't any game shelf to grab games so we decided to grab a deck of cards from across the street at the gas station. We saw a jenga set left from another group so we grabbed it. The waitress rushed over to tell us theirs a 2.99$ fee to play. Wow. You're going to charge to play a game? Wow. Okay. I felt that was so wrong for them to do, so we passed and played with our cards. Anyways, the waffles were good, icecream was good. Nothing special. You can probably find another dessert place around the corner who wont charge you for playing games. Won't be back though. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Bleh. Was not impressed with Cafe Princess at all.  The cake selection is everything you can purchase at Dimetres or even Second Cup, however, they mark up the price by at least a dollar. The slice of Chocolate Mouse cake I got was ridiculously small. I didn't think it was worth it for $7 price tag.   The Cafe is located on the second floor of a Korean restaurant, and when I walked in, it was surprisingly packed and super hot. There was sofas and chairs placed along the side of the walls and you have to ask to be seated and order your food at the counter on the far end of the cafe.   My friend's banana smoothie milkshake was extremely powdery and also not worth $7.   With so many other dessert places in the area, I definitely do NOT recommend Cafe Princess, nor would I come here again.   Tip: Cash or Debit only."}
{"text":"I like this place. Good customer service. Very friendly. Interior decoration makes it unique."}
{"text":"*If you are ordering a whole cake in advance, PLEASE check it before leaving the shop.*  I have ordered cakes from Cafe Princess a few times in the past and never had a problem until now. Recently I ordered an 8 inch strawberry cheese cake to be picked up on Monday night. When I got my cake, it tasted old and the strawberries were not fresh (they were turning black and the almonds were becoming soggy). I understand that Cafe Princess doesn't make their cakes and orders from a cake company, but the order label sticker had shown that the cake was delivered on Saturday morning and not the day of my order. The reason I had ordered ahead is so that I can get a fresh cake, but instead my cake has been sitting around for three days before I received it. Considering that the cake was made out of fruit, it was the cafe workers fault for ordering too far in advance. Very disappointing cause it went straight to the trash and it was quite pricey as well."}
{"text":"I'm seriously in love with this place! I always get great consistent service and the atmosphere is awesome! I think the atmosphere is what brings me back here!   It's just a great place to get some tasty desserts and chat with your girlfriends!   First time I came here, I got the princess platter (2 cakes and 2 ice creams of your choosing). I absolutely loved it!   My most recent visit I got the princess waffle. I wasn't too fond of the waffle. It was nice and light, but it was just bland.   I say go for the cakes and ice creams at best!!"}
{"text":"I can`t say I was overly impressed. A really cute place, but it had a very rustic and artificial feeling to it. The food was overpriced for the quality, I don`t know, I wouldn`t go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I had to have a relative show me this place...and he is all the way from Bayview and 16th!  No wonder as this is a gem of a place. Café Princess is on the second floor and as soon as you walk in, you see a hodge-podge of comfy chairs, sofas and tables from which to sit for hours and hours. Seriously, I just ordered a mint tea and my relative ordered a bubble tea and we sat on these comfy couches for 4 hours just chatting away. No one bothered us, asked us to move, to order more food, or kick us out. And for those reasons, I am giving this place a 4 star!  I can't comment on the food/desserts, but again, if you want a place where you can lounge and chat forever without being disturbed, this place is it. I believe you can also play games here so it would be a great post-dinner chill out place."}
{"text":"Located on the corner of Yonge & Finch on the second floor.   It's quite small in my opinion and the decor is Victorian-esque. We sat on one of the couches they have there and although it was comfortable to lie on, it wasn't very comfortable when I was trying to drink or eat from the table.   My friends and I shared a waffle dessert and it was pretty good. To drink I had an iced green tea drink (can't remember which one exactly) and it didn't leave a lasting impression..  The service was friendly.   Other than the decor, nothing really made Cafe Princess stand out from other cafes nearby."}
{"text":"Service was definitely lacking here.  We sat there for 15 minutes before the waitress noticed us and there wasn't even that many people.  We only had drinks but nothing special.  They had big couches and chairs for you to sit on but I would rather have better service.  This isn't my type of place to hang out in but I'm sure there are others who like it."}
{"text":"My bridal party had organized a girls night out for me and brought me here. It was my first time here as well. Such a pretty and cute cafe. They even had a heart tree/board where you can write on papers hearts and post it for everyone to read. I wrote one of course. n_n I do love that it's a place you can hang out with your friends at. They even have board games there too!   I ordered the sweet potato latte to start. My girlfriend recommended trying this drink. Not too sweet, just the way I like it! Although I don't recommend trying this AFTER trying a dessert...the drink will taste bland. n_n\"  Ordered the chocolate chip waffles with vanilla and cookies & cream ice cream to share with one of my girls.  Hands down the best waffles I've ever tasted. I loved the crunchy outer shell and extremely soft  texture on the inside. Delicious!   My best friend ordered the brownie chocolate cheesecake with caramel sauce. I tried some of course! I'm pretty sure the cakes here are store bought, but nevertheless still good! It was good for the first bite, but then the chocolate and the caramel sauce together was a bit too rich for me. Probably because I prefer less sweet...maybe that's why.   Definitely coming back to try their mochi waffles, looks quite interesting!"}
{"text":"Everyone must order at least one dish to chill here. Ok wifi, good for studying. Doesn't get too loud usually. They have different couches and decors that'll make you feel like a princess. The place itself is actually pretty big, they have some rooms in the back.  Drinks and food wise they're sub-par. Only their warm apple cider was good."}
{"text":"OKAY THIS PLACE IS SO CUTE. Came here and got the princess platter. Super delicious! They also have board games to play and free wi-fi as well. Will come back again soon :)"}
{"text":"I rate this dessert joint 3.5 stars just because they charge you a fee for playing their board games (ridiculous fee if you ask me!)  Other than that, the atmosphere and decor of this cafe is super cute. I really love the mural on the wall. Dessert selection offers a variety of items-- waffles, crepes, shakes, parfaits, sundaes, cakes, smoothies, bubbleteas etc. They should consider selling macarons and other pastries to offer an even more versatile menu. Presentation and taste of the waffles/crepes are 4/5! Delicious and aesthetically pleasing enough to take photos! Their Oreo milkshake tastes like a Starbucks frap, which is pretty good. I find their cake choices are typical and usually the same cakes I find at Destiny Bubbletea or Go for Tea--nothing great. The pricing of most of their items, though, is quite expensive. I only come here once in a blue moon if I happen to be around the Yonge and Finch area. Service is decent, but they could improve on their serving etiquette and at least seem more interested in the customer.   Overall, a nice and cosy dessert cafe if you don't mind spending a lot. If they didn't charge me $2.50 for playing games (which there was no sign to mention that), I would have given an extra star...such a shame."}
{"text":"Despite limited menu choices, this place is very cozy and offers some interesting dessert/drinks, like the Italian affogato. Delicious, mixing the best of both worlds (espresso and ice cream). A good place to check out if you want to get some work done in a casual environment."}
{"text":"Cafe Princess offers a wide variety of cakes and desserts.  Their cakes are good - tried the Strawberry Shortcake and Red Velvet as recommended by the server.  Got two different waffles with Ice-cream on it.  You can choose your ice cream from a variety.  Nice comfy couches to sit on and relax atmosphere.  The decor are mixed and match as most furnitutres were different from each other.  Rating:  Service: 2/5 Food Quality: 3/5 Comfort 5/5 Decor  4/5 Value: 3/5 Parking: 2/5"}
{"text":"I honestly love this place! I have been going here for awhile but have never thought to check in until recently! I know, how could I forget?? This place is really nice and if cake didn't mean a ton of calories I would be here more often! :D  Located near Finch station, this is a little cafe and cake shop above a korean restaurant. You need to go up a short set of stairs and then you have arrived...in a very princess-y, royal-looking, cutesy place! They have a few couches for the bigger groups and then tables for the smaller groups. Pretty clean and neat place.  They have a few cake selections available and also a ton of other drinks and desserts in their menu. For a small place I think it's still nice to have a good amount of variety and this place does, if not, more. So far, with the cakes I have tried, I don't have any complaints :) drinks are decent as well!  I have never had any issues with service. Or maybe I'm just lucky to always come at a time when it isn't busy. Waiters and waitresses are nice, they do their job and check back on you occassionally.  I would definitely visit frequently if I could especially since it is near Yonge and Finch and there are a ton of things to do here! I would recommend for others to try if they are in the area! :)"}
{"text":"The place is very feminine. It's a great place to sit back and have some bubble tea and desserts and relax. Not much to do here though...  My criticisms: there wasn't huge selection of board games (maybe 6) so I don't consider this place a board game Cafe. I don't know why this happened to me but I couldn't connect to their wifi whereas my 4 friends could. So I sucked that I couldn't use their wifi. So I found the place really boring- other than eating and chatting with friends. There's literally nothing else to do here  Positives: the place smells really nice when you walk in- there's a strong cake smell. The service was good and there was quiet music in the background; which was very relaxing.   Food: I only ordered a bubble tea- taro milk tea. I'm not ecstatic about their beverage choices because I am a health-conscious person and I hate powdered drinks. On the plus side, it tasted very nice.   This place wasn't for me because I hate desserts and there was nothing to do here!!!"}
{"text":"We were brought the wrong order, and the staff refused to correct it and bring us the correct item.  Pretty poor service I'd say."}
{"text":"The waffle desserts are less than average. Decor is nice but it's not cool to charge for every board game."}
{"text":"The name says it all to describe the décor and atmosphere. Everything that can be pink or white, is definitely pink or white! A relatively quiet place overlooking Yonge street, a good alternative spot from the busy Starbucks across the street and a bit more private due to take second floor location. Prices are average on the food, and a bit steep on the drinks, and everyone coming must order something! To be fair, seating is limited, and sitting around without purchase is just not the best patron etiquette. Fortunately there's no minimum purchase amount unlike some other places, so I count that as a positive.  Their desserts are very much items you can make at home or purchase elsewhere, but nonetheless they are well presented and priced pretty fairly. You'll find cake (La Rocca!), ice cream sundaes, waffles, parfaits, and the like - all with cute names or combinations that make everything add to the atmosphere. I got the nuts waffle to share, which is a regular waffle with a sprinkle of assorted nuts, accompanied by two scoops of ice cream - vanilla and cookies n cream. (NOTE: waffle orders can be split between two people and count as their required \"order per person\", yay!) The waffle was fresh, the nuts were a bit skimpy, and the ice cream was low quality. But it did come beautifully presented! No complaints on presentation at all!  Based on various other comments I gave their sweet potato latte a try. Their regular size is a \"small\" elsewhere, and I always forget a latte without the \"café\" part is really just a steamed milk drink. It smelled great and was piping hot when it arrived, and there was a faint sweet potato flavour that was enjoyable and unique. Unfortunately as I neared the bottom I found the \"grits\" of the sweet potato - as expected really on hindsight, and goes to show there really was something else other than milk and sugar. The bits were similar to sesame or peanut bits left over in your milk tea, so it wasn't terrible but for the surprise as much of it sank at the bottom and I didn't have a spoon to stir.  There's free wifi available and it worked pretty well, and many people were sitting around with their laptops working quietly.  Overall no complaints but really nothing special, a good hidden gem for those seeking the adorable cute experience and a quieter spot to catch up."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because of its good reviews, and the good things I hear about it from my fans. However I was pretty disappointed by this place. First off you have to pay to play the games here. I could do that for free at home, or go to Snakes and Lattes where they have a wider range of games for me to play. In terms of desserts, it wasn't that special, and like some people have mentioned you can get the same items from Caffe Demetre or Second Cup, plus Cafe Princess does mark up the prices. The drinks aren't bad, but I think I prefer the ones from Pastel more down the street. I think the only redeeming thing for this place are the couches, and I think that's a weak reason to visit a place. I mean there's always home right? At home you can even avoid obnoxious high schoolers  that show up here ;)"}
{"text":"When I came here I thought this place was a quaint little gem that may not be as visible to most since it's located on the upper level of another business along Yonge. Entering the vicinity you feel surprised because of the light and playful decor, mixed with the home-y vibe you get from the sight of the sofa's. I wouldn't say the drinks stood out as anything special, nor did I order any food to go along with it so I can't comment on how flavorful the food is per say, but I think due to the decor and the fact that you can tell they really want to cater to their customers by making them feel \"at home\" that it's the experience and overall ambiance of the place that gives it that extra edge most bubble tea shops along Yonge don't have."}
{"text":"I ordered milk tea after work at around 11pm. I believe it was strawberry flavoured with fancy shaped ice cubes in my drink. I ordered it to go. I was quite hungry at the time but decided to get a drink from this cafe. However, the next morning, my stomach felt different and I felt a bit dizzy, so I ended up throwing up. I did not know why until I realized I had milk tea from the night before from this cafe. I was quite confused as to why it happened."}
{"text":"This a really cute place to come for a date or hangout with girlfriends. The items are a bit overpriced but you are paying for the environment as well. Also, board games are an extra $2.50 and the selection is limited. They have jenga but it's really loud when it falls so beware if you don't like attention in your general direction. There was a really drunk guy there so he took all the attention, thank you drunk guy  :)  Washrooms are super cute too and there are private party rooms available.   They have wifi and the password is on their menu but it didn't connect today for some reason.  There is also parking on the street, which is free after 10pm.   Service was friendly, we stayed almost until their closing (1am) but they didn't rush us to go. Bill splitting is available but you should probably tell the server that before she prints the bill."}
{"text":"It is a great hang out spot.. There are lots of comfortable couches to sit and chill. Each person has to buy something in order to sit down. Service is good."}
{"text":"It's a cute place I suppose. They've got couches on one half of the floor and regular tables on the other. Some board games available to use.  Menu comes with a number of drinks and desserts. The usual fare such as cakes, bingsu, waffles, ice cream, fruits.  If you're bringing a partner they've got a princess platter that comes with 2 cakes, 2 scoops of ice cream, some slices of fruit, and two sticks of generic wafer biscuits. Price works out pretty well.  They do make it look presentable, so that's a plus.  If you're looking for a dessert place, this one's convenient if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We went there around lunch time on a Saturday and it was very empty but it quickly filled up with people within an hour or two. The couch area is pretty cozy especially if you can sit by the window and look outside.  We had tried a few different drinks like the sweet potato latte, roasted grain latte, a milk shake and tea. The drinks were all delicious.  We also had a green tea waffle and a red velvet cake which were also very tasty. The waffles were made fresh and therefore slightly crunchy which is good.  Good place to hang out with friends or alone."}
{"text":"There's only one word to describe this place: Cute.  It's a great place to snack on some desserts and catch up with some friends. The interior design caters to the girly, floral-print-loving side in me. They also play some K-Pop in the background if you're into that.  The service is good and the waitresses are very nice.  Their cakes are good, but I think they just purchase them from the local grocery store or similar. The drinks are rather good, but I wasn't a fan of their sweet potato latte. It was my first time trying it though.  It is quite a pricey spot however. If you want their princess platter consisting of ice cream and waffles, or their fondue set in which they melt chocolate under a candle and give you some fruits and biscuits to dip in, then you'll have to fork up a bit. I believe it's around $14.50ish for the fondue but if you don't mind, then go for it.   Overall, I recommend this place if you want to have a chit-chat with the girls (or guys). The atmosphere is worth it."}
{"text":"Nice spot with nice couches and tables. Great menu with lots of desserts and drinks. Reasonable price. Has games they charged 2.50$ to use. Good atmosphere to chill. Went on a Saturday night only few other people."}
{"text":"Since I cannot comment on the food (all the desserts contain dairy, and a tuna sandwich just isn't dessert-y enough for me), I will comment on the atmostphere.   The couches (if you can get them) are ridiculously comfortable, and the place looks like Princess Peach (from Mario's) living room. The service is a little slow, but you're here to relax and have some coffee and dessert. The desserts look amazing (pocky in a chocolate parfaitt?! Genius!) and I saw Karl down a large slice of cake in about 20 seconds, so they must be good.   A great place to take a date if you plan to completely emasculate him or a little girl if she really loves pink and desserts."}
{"text":"Overall cute place. It is quite run down and not as modern as cafes that you'll see on BlogTo or Narcity but it does have its quirks. It has an area where there are a bunch of hearts that you can write on which is adorable. We got the strawberry short cake which was hovering around $7 and the chocolate waffles which was around $12 which in my opinion isn't bad but with places like Sugar Marmalade with waffles and more options for food it's just not as comparable. The cake was good, but just average. I do like however how it wasn't super sweet. They also do have a couple of games if you want to pay $2.50 per person. I would come again if I were in the area but it wouldn't be my go-to spot."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and absolutely my favourite Cafe! I am in love with this place. I ordered the rice cake bingsu and iced caramel macchiato and the macchiato is way better than the one from Starbucks! I reccommend to everyone especially the patbingsu/sherbet ! Soo good!!"}
{"text":"This place gets top marks for decor, and comfort but the food selection is more limited than it's competitors.   There are tons of comfortable couches, and the place looks like a Sanrio church. It's a nice space for chilling with groups. The board games are a nice touch.  The food selection needs work. For some reason I always have trouble finding something I want. Perhaps the menu caters to a more asian audience, rather than my more americanized tastes.   The weak internet here also makes this place hard to choose because of the insanely fast internet available at places nearby like Chatime, or even orange caramel cafe.   This places does tend to be quiet during the day, and I could see myself coming back to take advantage of the space for large groups, and the longer hours of operation as compared to places like orange caramel cafe."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Very cute. The snack/drinks we had were so so and severely overpriced. I haven't tried the waffle but if the desert we had was any indication, stick with the drinks.  We ordered a shaved ice with red bean (pat bing su) which is a trendy cafe desert in Korea. This is the Korean style one which is slightly different from the Taiwanese one. This was godawful. The red bean's flavor was not really there. They added canned fruits to it. It has to be the worst $9 I spent on food this entire year if I measure it from a food quality perspective. It's edible but a far cry from the \"bing su\" I had in Korea. Still...the whole point of this desert is to get a large to share it with your partner which we did. We both think it sucked but at least we can laugh about it so in that sense, it's worth it.  They have board games but they look really beat up. We stuck with chatting over a drink.   If you're coming here, it's for the atmosphere. This is a nice cafe to chill with a girl. Or a good place for a bunch of girls to hang out. It's not a nice place to chill with guys as that get a bit awkward fast. I'd come again if the chance arises."}
{"text":"Cafe Princess is a quaint coffee/tea-desserts shop on the second floor.  The decor is a confused arrangement of Ikea-esque sofas and victorian-style chaises.  .  It is a partial waiter service setting. You place your order with a server but at the end you go to the cash register to pay your bill cafeteria style.   We ordered a Strawberry Shortcake to share, a Green Tea Latte as well as a Cappucccino.  The Green Tea Latte tasted like the GreenMax powdered pouches at T&T.  The powdery residue at the end was perfect proof!    This is a nice place to go on a date as you can relax side by side on the couch with your date and makes it more intimate.  Its also a place you can go with your laptop or a book and spend hours sipping back a coffee while browsing or reading.  You don't feel rushed out the door.   The cake appears to be store bought and the latte was standard.  This is a great alternative to a Bubble Tea Shop as the noise level is acceptable and allows for conversation without having to talk loudly.  All in all, average food and bevvies, but great ambiance."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this place since he had discovered it and came here before with his friends. It's located on the 2nd floor of a building, and as for parking I couldn't really find a place so I decided to park near in the Scotia bank lot.  (Keep in mind that the maximum you can stay at this location is 2 hours).  When I first entered I was awe-strucked because EVERYTHING IS CUTE, PINK, AND GIRLY. I literally wanted to jump onto the sofas because they looked so comfy but I withheld from doing so. The decor itself is fabulous and is very visually appealing. Anyways, my friend and I was seated near the windows, and checked in around 10-11pm. It wasn't too packed.   The service itself was not too shabby, the server came with the menus and I ended up ordering: The Iced Honey Jin Citron Green - Tea and the Brownie Chocolate Cheese Cake.  The cheese cake was good but I really loved the Green Tea as it was flavorful but was not overwhelmed with lemon.  In conclusion; this place would be great for a date, or even for a group get together.   ~Wifi is available ~Food was average for the most part ~Price Range was affordable but a tad to the expensive side ~Decor is adorable ~Noise level is moderate  I would definitely come visit again and recommend others to try it out!!"}
{"text":"Fun place to have dessert and coffee and even play games! Prices are reasonable as well. Might be our new favourite spot for coffee and desserts on Yonge.   Only issue was our service was a little slow last time we went and they don't accept credit cards. Also debit had a nominal up charge of $0.09. I'd figure it's not worth impacting your customers opinion over 9 cents."}
{"text":"A cute little pink themed cafe with free Internet. It's a great chilling spot, I love that there are sofas everywhere. Their matcha green tea waffles are sooo good. But their drinks are overpriced and not special. Beware: their \"regular coffee\" is just overpriced instant coffee,  a waste of money. Giving this place 4 stars for the peacefulness of the place and their waffles. Other than that, the drinks are nothing special."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for quite a while. Its a neat hidden coffeeshop near Finch.  All foods and drinks are served in proper China plates / mugs which is always welcomed over paper cups. Instead of your generic chairs and tables you have some real comfy, living room style couches.  Both hot and cold drinks are great (except sik hye!). Sweets are tasty and come in generous portions. Most items has chocolate including bagels! It's reasonably priced.  Complimentary lemon water. Washrooms are very clean. WiFi used to be bad but its much better now.  I'm surely treated like a princess every time I come here!!"}
{"text":"After an attempt to go to Chatime on a Satruday night, and seeing the giant line up, we decided to go to Cafe Princess. We also picked it because it was one of the few places in this area that may actually have board games.   Right abot Twister, you feel like you've walked into someones living room. IT's really girly, with plush couches and armchairs. A little weird at first, but you get used to it. We didn't have to wait long for a table. Surprisingly there were a lot of guys in here, and not with dates.   The food wasn't amazing, but decent. We got a waffle to share, but it ended up a bit soggy, but the green tea ice cream was tasty. Instead of bubble tea, we all got apple cider - it was decent.   We were looking for a place with board games, and this was our only option up here. They have simple old school games like Clue, Monopoly, Jenga, Game of Life at $2.50 per game. We went old school and played Monopoly for the evening. It was fun.   Nice place to hang out. The couches are really soft."}
{"text":"I'm constantly visiting Toronto and each time I go there I try to check out a different coffee/tea shop and on this particular day, I wanted to go to a Korean cafe that served a Korean specific drink, misugahroo. I'd been craving it since leaving Orange County, CA and was hoping to get something just as delicious, tasty as the one I'd grown to love while living in SoCal.  Found this spot via Yelp and it's located on the second floor of a strip mall so if you're handicapped, you're shit out of luck because the only way up is by a long, narrow set of stairs from the backside of the building.  But once you're up, you're invited into a comfortable setting with soft music playing overhead. The only window is towards the back of the store where the large windows allows for plenty of sunlight to stream in.   I was there with some family members and so we each ordered something different. I got my misugahroo drink. They were all just ok. Nothing too special. My drink was not only not satisfying, but it only intensified my cravings for some good misugahroo.  Being that this is somewhat in the middle of Toronto's Ktown, next time I visit, I think I'll check out another spot and try their drinks there.   Service was decent. They don't really come by to check up on you but that's just Korean customer service in the food sector in general so I wasn't surprised or annoyed.  Free WiFi though it's spotty and slow.  Parking: Paid lot Price: $5+ Wait: 5 mins"}
{"text":"The place is hidden away on the top floor on yonge, you've got to climb some stairs to get it. The chairs and tables are so cute! We sat in vintage styled armchairs and the table looked a little vintage too. They even had large love seats for lovebirds. It's a very feminine, cosy and cutesy place.  We ordered taro and a peach bubble tea and the rice waffle with a scoop green tea ice cream and strawberry ice cream. Let me tell you, it's DELICIOUS. The texture and flavour was unreal, never had I had something like it and 100% would have it again. The bubble tea was nothing exciting, tasted like it was probably powdered. The prices were a little pricey, luckily I wasn't the one paying but honestly I would only buy the rice waffle next time. The service and music was pretty good too.  There's also boardgames here, they had about 6 or 7, not a big selection and they looked a little run down but still not a big deal if you're with the right company. It keeps things interesting.  Overall, would go again! :)"}
{"text":"there is no customer service at this cafe at all!! drinks and desserts are soso. not worth to come !!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite dessert place on Yonge. Very nice coffee shop style atmosphere with comfy sofas and seats. Free Wifi. Their sherbets (shaved ice) amongst other desserts are really good. Good service and order came very fast. The price is not cheap but not too expensive either compared to other places on Yonge. There are also private rooms and board game options avaliable. Overall, it is hard to find things to complain about this place."}
{"text":"(Food:) The GREEN TEA WAFFLES were adequate.  They come with two waffles, a few scoops of ice cream and some whipped cream.  It wasn't that special or that tasty either.    (Price:)  It was over $11.  Definitely not worth it.  (Ambience:) There are a few couches to sit on, and the environment is quite pink and lovey dovey.  Not quite my style.    (Comparable:) Just go to Demetres instead if you're going to spend over $10 on a waffle."}
{"text":"My younger cousins are in love with Café Princess. After hearing them rave about it, I went here for the first time after lunch with one of them. The place wasn't packed. I was told that it's packed in the evening. The place is adorable with red and pink decorations, sofas and 'Victorian' (old fashion) style chair. Definitely love the atmosphere here.  It's self seated and we picked a table by the windows with the teddy bears. The desserts and drinks were good but I definitely expected more from them. My cousin and I shared a moffle (rice cake waffle) with green tea ice cream. This was definitely an interesting dessert as I bite into it, it has a squishy feel to it and very chewy. You can taste the honey, which went very well with the rice cake flavour. We also ordered a Nuts waffle which was decent. I felt that the waffle was very light (not dense enough).  For drinks, we ordered green tea latte and sweet potatoes latte. The green tea latte wasn't sweet (at all) compared to the past (as per my cousin). The sweet potatoes latte was interesting and taste like you're drinking sweet potatoes.   This is a very cute place for a girls get together. You just can't come here thinking that the deserts will be amazing."}
{"text":"Cafe princess needs an update. The couches are getting dirty! Food and drinks are not bad - worth a try"}
{"text":"I really LIKE the design of this Cafe.  The entrance is nothing more than a small door that leads you upstairs to the second floor Cafe Princess, so you might actually pass by this Yonge st. Cafe multiple times without realizing it like I did.  Here's why I like the design of this place.  First, the Washroom where they designated the men's as \"Prince\" has a toilet that is made for a KING.  It's not your low-flow eco-friendly crap, but it's your industrial strength whirlpool/blackhole that consumes everything.  Second, the pathway to the WASHROOM also has a secondary back exit which is great for:  1. When an annoying EX walks through the front door. 2. When you want to leave your buddy Karl R. with the bill.  Third, there is a small room at the back that is not Princess themed but looks like a great private hangout place away from the crowd.  Comfy Sofas and soft relaxing Korean pop in the background, my dreams of this as my NEW condo aside, I had a Chocolate Parfait($7) suggested by the cutie waitress.  She directed me towards the Chocolate and she was right because the other selections were Yogurt, and Fruit which the Chocolate(Ice Cream) Parfait had a little bit of both already.    A-OK as a parfait is concern since if you come to a place such as this, you're probably not worried about the Food & Beverages but rather the company you're with and the relaxation of getting away towards your dreams of being a Princess.  Standard boost-up pricing as other Bubble Tea Houses and such.  Standard Cakes and Drinks."}
{"text":"You have to pay for parking at the back of Princess Cafe as it is located on Yonge Street on the second floor of an old building. Although the building itself is old, the inside of Cafe Princess is decorated really nicely with cute sofas and makes the environment very relaxing. It's a really great place to have some high tea and enjoy an afternoon tea with your friends.  We shared the green tea waffle and a tiramisu. In addition, we also tried the drinks. The waffles were a little dry and mediocre in my opinion. The tiramisu and green tea ice cream tasted like it was bought from a supermarket. The drinks are cute as the barista put their effort into making a smile from the lattes."}
{"text":"This is the place if you are looking a quite place for your morning meeting or you want to  work something on your laptop. Comfortable couches feels like at home"}
{"text":"This place is fairly awesome. It's been described as a board game cafe in some places, but the selection of games is rather small. We brought our own (Settlers) and didn't have any problems setting up at a table as we placed our orders.  The food was rather good, and probably comparable in price to most coffee/dessert shops. I tried the strawberry waffle (a belgian waffle with strawberry jam, strawberry ice cream, whipped cream, and sliced strawberries), which was excellent, as well as a mango-strawberry smoothie (they'll mix the flavours they offer, upon request), and a coffee.  My only complaint would be about the coffee... it wasn't excellent (and it was served a bit on the warm side, rather than hot), though it also wasn't bad, and was perfectly drinkable.  I would definitely go back here for another board game night."}
{"text":"This little cafe near Young and Finch is a great hangout spot for those days you want to just have some waffles and play some boardgames. It's opened quite late, the interior is eye pleasing, and gives off an overall cozy vibe.  1. Food (3/5)  Being a cafe, the shop has many desserts and bubble teas for you to choose from. The price on the items is $$, but the quality could be a bit better. I had the moffle (pronounced 'mofo'), which is a rice cake-based waffle with two types of ice cream. The ice cream was great but I found that the actual waffle was a bit too sweet and would much rather prefer the original!  2. Game Selection (2.5/5)  There were not many games that visitors could choose from. Also, you have to pay for the games (around $2 for each game that you borrow). I wouldn't mind paying the price for the games if there were more games but the mostly only had Jenga and Monopoly deals.   3. Interior and Vibe (4/5)  The place was relatively quiet on a Friday night around 11pm. The seats were also very comfy and the place gave off a peaceful and cozy feeling. Definitely a place that you would like to visit during a date!  Overall (3/5):  Overall, the cafe was not anything extravagant but if you are on a date, you might want to consider this place since it's often quiet and romantic."}
{"text":"This was used to be my favourite cafe but not anymore..couches and tables are dirty not like before and it makes me feel like Cinderella not princess. Not a bad portion to go near finch station but not best. The other table was so loud/ shouting and screaming for playing board games and servers just let them to do. And food is nothing special. I expected to have better quality tea for the price but ended up having so cheap tea bags. Will not going back unless my friends wants to go"}
{"text":"I went in here after going to Nak Won for dinner. We walked up the stairs and the decor was pretty cute. It was like princess peach on acid in victorian times. I liked it.  We sat down on the two person table in the mad corner, and the waitress brought us the menu.  The menu was really cute, it had a really cute type face and some of the specialty items had really cutesy names.   Too bad it was too expensive for us to stay.   Maybe closer to payday, ill try again."}
{"text":"Food is good.. even place is nice and clean.. a tiny bit pricey but my main concern is they should have dishwasher..i saw the girl washing dishes with sponge just sitting in the sink that could have bacteria, very not hygienic.. this is a cafe that should have a proper dishwasher!  If people that works from food sanitation and hygiene inspect this cafe, this cafe didn't met the food safety requirement..."}
{"text":"This cafe is super cute! I think the decor makes it a lot better than what it would've been. The seating is super comfy, with large soft couches and velveteen chairs.  Each table has little jars of sugar (just for decor.... I don't think you'd want to use it, it seems like it's been sitting there for the past decade) and it's indeed a very 'princessy' cafe. It just seems warm and welcoming. I love coming here when it's cold and rainy/snowy outside. The service is not the best, but it's manageable. Many don't know, but you are allowed to seat yourself as soon as you go in. The servers will come give you menus after.  This place is good for groups but it's one order per person- don't bring in a group without everyone expecting to place an order.   I don't like the steep steps that lead up to the cafe and I especially hate going down. Mind you, it's not because of my physical fitness LOL. I'm just scared I'm going to plummet to my death and end up sending EMS responders to the entrance of princess cafe.   The food and drinks are mediocre at best. They're really nothing special, it's some generic shit you can get anywhere. This place also overcharges a bit so what you pay is not what you get. The tapioca is very hard and the slush is mild, no strong flavours.  I heard the best thing is the cheesecake, even though I didn't get to try it myself.  I am also a fan of the 'snow white', but really... it's just ice cream and a wafer stick. I can do that by myself.   They don't accept credit cards, only debit and cash.  Also, the crowd here is very 'straight out from mainland'... not to be rude or anything, there's always loud asians giggling and being noisy. I don't need to hear you snorting in mandarin when I'm sipping my bubbletea."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday late afternoon with 5 friends. It is a good place to just sit and chill as they have couches and a home-like atmosphere mostly through their decorations. They have free WiFi, but the internet was so slow to load my Instagram that I preferred to use my data instead.   We ordered drinks, cookies & cream milkshake, cookies & cream cheesecake, and Bailey's cheesecake.  The drinks were simple, as expected and no complaint, and the Bailey's cheesecake was good. However, the milkshake was slushy and was more on the frap side than a real milkshake. The supposed to be cookies & cream cheesecake was actually a chocolate cake with a middle part of \"cookies & cream cheese\" which did not really taste like it contained cheese.   They have a few selection of board games and Jenga game. A few years ago, my friends came and could play if they ordered something but now, we have to pay to play those games.   Food/drink: 3/5 Price: 3/5 cleanliness: 4/5 Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"My first impression of Café Princess: an Asian girl's dream! You got the pink walls, the paper hearts with messages on them, the soft, cushy couches, the Victorian style chairs, flowers, the stuffed animals and last but not least, the Hello Kitty dolls. The cafe would be perfect for a kdrama setting. It's also pretty awesome that they have free wifi. The drinks are a bit on the pricey side but then again, the drinks are pretty big. The drinks themselves tasted all right - nothing special. You can easily get the same drinks from other cafes. Everything else on the menu looked really good though!  The servers were a bit standoffish. Both times when I came to Princess, the servers would forget about you if you tell them that you need time to think about what to order. I had to physically get up and ask for them to take your order, something that I'm not too pleased about. Apart from that, the cafe has a really chilled out ambiance and is very relaxing. I would recommend coming here if you're out on a date or if you're with some girlfriends."}
{"text":"I really liked my over all experience at Cafe Princess. I really liked the free WiFi because I like to Yelp, Blog, Twitter and Instagram everything I do, especially places I eat. I am a bit of an amateur food critic.   The Selection of coffee and hot drinks at Cafe Princess are typical of all cafes, the desserts were very good. The waffles are made on demand, plus they have my favorite velvet cake. The ambience is nice; the couches make you feel at home and comfortable for a short snooze.   I am a definite fan of this place and am a regular, to the point where I know the wait staff by name. I always try something new every time I am there and so far I have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is cutesy, but I'm not really a girly girl so I'm not one who would come here just for that reason. I'm all about the food and drinks. I will say that it's a nice touch that guys get a blue colored menu and girls get a pink colored menu.  I suggested we come here because my friend used to be obsessed with Green Grotto's baked mochis. When I saw that this place had a mochi waffle, we decided to check it out.My friend and I both got waffles and I got a sweet potato latte because it sounded like something that only Cafe Princess offers. I enjoyed the sweet potato latte because it tasted like frothed ginger milk, albeit a tad too sweet.     Sadly, the moffle (their name, I didn't coin it) tasted very rice-y and the texture was sort of like chewing gum. It definitely didn't taste like a glutinous rice mochi. My friend called it awffle (like as in awful, not like awwww it's so cute-waffle).  I, on the other hand, ordered a nuts waffle and their regular waffle batter is delicious! It was light and fluffy and the nuts complemented the vanilla ice-cream and waffle well. The cookies n creme ice-cream tasted off though and I'm not sure if it's because of freezer burn or if this batch was weird. I don't think they make the ice-cream in-house either, in case we have any ice-cream aficionados reading this review.  I thought the experience here was OK. Would i come back again? Probably not....there's so many other dessert places and bubble tea shops to go to/try in this area!"}
{"text":"If you love Korean dramas & K-pop, this is the cafe for you! Cafe Princess....Hmmmm.....Cafe = Coffee....Princess is just a little too similar to Prince. Wait! Is this place a take off of the Korean drama, Coffee Prince? You bet! Located in the North York Koreatown, this cafe is just like the cafes found in Korean dramas, music videos, & movies. You just have to see it! If this place was anywhere near me (and it's not since I live in the States), I would be there all the time! I had a fabulous iced sweet potato latte, & my husband had a blueberry iced tea with tapioca. We didn't try the desserts, but they looked delectable. We sat on comfy sofas and listened to K-pop while observing an adorable Korean couple wearing matching shirts. This place oozes with Korean greatness! I plan to go back next time I'm in the wonderful city of Toronto!"}
{"text":"It's a tiny little cafe located in New Koreatown. The interior decor is a little shabby - couches with floral patterns and whatnot. The entire atmosphere, IF YOU HAVEN'T GUESSED IT FROM THE NAME OF THE ESTABLISHMENT, is very feminine. To the guys - don't go in there with a bunch of your dude friends. You will feel weird and awkward.  The food/drinks are a bit on the pricey side, but the quality is pretty decent. Try the iced green tea latte. My girlfriend said that it was above average, and she's a coffee connoisseur.  Kind of wish that the board games were free to use, but hey, that's asking for a little too much."}
{"text":"Cafe Princess is a neat surprise, tucked away in the Yonge and Finch area, with a deceiving entrance. When you climb the stairs to the 2nd floor, you'd be pleasantly taken aback to find a elegantly decorated store with customers relaxing on large comfy sofas. It definitely brings a \"homey\" feeling, different than the usual coffee shops I go to.  With soft Korean pop music playing in the background, my guest and I made our way through the disorganized arrangement of furniture to find a comfortable spot. Service was slow, but it also allows you to feel no pressure to stay as long as you want.   The menu offered a variety of hot (coffee, tea, lattes) and cold drinks (bubble tea, parfaits), waffles, ice cream, CAKES, sandwiches. Though I didn't get a chance to try the cakes, the selections looked delicious.  Ordered a waffle with green tea and strawberry ice cream. It costed approx. the same as a waffle at Demetres, though I thought Cafe Princess was pretty decent.  Overall, a comfortable, intimate hang out spot, great ambience, and decent desserts.  Note: There is paid parking at the back of the building."}
{"text":"First time going to a board game café and it was pretty fun! Cafe princess is located on the second floor right off of Yonge and finch. The interior is very very girly and pretty. It's almost like going to a tea room.   Food was okay. I ordered the fruit sherbert (shaved ice) and my friends ordered some waffles which came with icecream. The only downside I have is that every board game you play costs $2.50. I don't think they keep track of how many you play but you tell them how many you played? We just said we played one game haha (which we kinda did). Figuring out how to play games didn't make it that fun!  I had a great experience with my first board game café and can't wait to try some more places! For the meantime, I would come here again because I love the environment and design."}
{"text":"meant to post this feedback earlier! but that's \"a-ok\" This place can be tough to find if you're not a local, neatly tucked away up a flight of stairs, its seems at first you've come across a sketchy bar with a sketchy stairwell, but once you get to the top, its a cute lil joint to chill out, have some bubble tea, and desserts.  Came here on a Saturday night, and was thrilled I didnt have to wait, considering the place was already packed.  I decided to have their Strawberry cheesecake and bubble tea.  The overall service was alright, but not a place for a meal.  Its moreso made for desserts, and teas.  Would I come back here? no, the area is great, but not car friendly (parking) on a saturday night, and they could do with a new paint job in the stairwell."}
{"text":"Neat little place. Enjoyed one of their waffles. A tad pricy, but it has a charming atmosphere. The two of us were seated at couches and a big coffee table one would find in a living room.  Note the two-hour limit."}
{"text":"It was alright. I got a piece of strawberry shortcake cake and it was yummy, but the service did take a while because we were in the corner, which wasn't a big deal. The atmosphere was very cutesy and it was fun... next time, I'll get something or more filling."}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype from my friends, I decided to check it out. The decor is really cute and girly however the service here lacked a lot. They didn't notice us for about 20 minutes with us trying to flag them down. We got cocoa waffles, original bubble tea and korean fermented tea. Bubble tea was watered down, waffles and ice cream were just lacking. The Korean tea was a good different but everything was just overpriced."}
{"text":"They charged you for using the board game and they didn't even have many game options! Food and drink are not very considering other stores in the same area. The decoration of the store look adorable yet very dusty and old, seems like they don't clean it often."}
{"text":"This place was my go-to cafe because it's so cute and cozy. I say 'was' because this place is really for an update/renovation. I think based on the stylish interior designs of cafes in Toronto these days, the place seems outdated.  The food is nicely presented and good value for the price, since you're paying extra to stay and chat in the restaurant, you're not just paying for food.  I find the drinks just ok but the desserts are always solid, for example the cakes are great each time. I usually get a platter to share with friends."}
{"text":"Yum yum yummy! I've only been here once, but it's a place I'm planning to frequent after college. The place is cozy and comfy and the drinks and food are what you expect. Since I went there with friends, I was able to try three different snacks and three different drinks. Overall a great day and a great time"}
{"text":"Mmmmm red velvet cake is now on offer. Worth a trip back. My sweet date ordered \"anything with chocolate\" and a Yam latte. Yeah. Yam. Sweet potato. In coffee. It's not the weirdest offering I've seen at a Korean coffee shop back in the motherland (the weirdest would be a tomato frappucino). The Yam latte, however, not so fussy. My sweet date's chocolate slice was, according to the waitress, not up to their normal standards so she include an extra slice of red velvet to make up.   Wow."}
{"text":"It's a place to hang out and have dessert with a special someone or a group of friends. The food and drinks are expensive relative to their base cost at a bakery or whatnot, but remember that you're paying for the privilege of sitting in the lounge.  I was there for a brief hour and didn't get to see different aspects of the cafe (such as board games and other things), but I found the decor and general environment to be good. I did feel the couches were a bit uncomfortable though, being too soft and easily sinking into them."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Cafes in Toronto! I think that the Idea for \"cafe Princess\" Came from \"coffee Prince\" a popular Korean TV Drama back in 2007! The First time I went there was in 2008 summer and have been coming back there ever since! ...at least once a month, despite the fact that it's 1 1/2 TTC from my house. !! I usually dislike long distance commutes but I'll do it for this place!  Cafe princess Is your total Korean cafe experience. Unlike Canadian/European cafes' Asian cafes are all about the atmosphere, design and providing a comfortable home -like relaxing experience for the customers! From the teddy bears on the window still, to the soft flowery couches/ large wooden tables/ and now a beautifully painted mural near the washrooms in the hall way... every corner of this place will make you feel comfortable and not want to leave.   I would say that the food here is good!~   It's your typical Asian cafes sweets and drinks but with a MUCH better atmosphere! I think that some people expect more of the food/ drinks by looking at the place, and get a bit disappointed when they get a bubble similar to that of Tea shop 168, or a frozen green tea shake which is similar to a Starbucks frappaccino...or a red bean Ice slush similar to one you can get in Korea town  at a small stand....   They are still all very delicious desserts! The only problem would be that for some people their menu selections are not the most original which they aren't... Cafe Princess imports their cakes from La Rocca and most of their bubbles teas and snacks... for example like the waffle and tea combo I usually get is very similar to the one I could get from a shop 5 min down-the  street from my house.... It is a very beautifully presented waffle with fruits and ice-cream but  not the most original... Despite this I still give this place 5 stars ... because the experience is amazing and probably unlike any you will have at other traditional cafes..  Things to consider - cafe princess will not accept credit cards (Debit or Cash) -Friday and Saturday nights especially get really crowded and busy so , service might be slow and atmosphere noisy and less enjoyable"}
{"text":"Always stop here to relax and enjoy ice cream waffles and hot tea on the way home from downtown. On the expensive side, but the atmosphere is cozy. However, the sofas look like they haven't been cleaned in a while, which is a little off-putting."}
{"text":"This place is our go-to if we can't decide where to have our bubble tea.  The environment is so cute and their desserts are yum.  There is nothing special about their dishes.  They're over priced cakes and goodies you can find at grocery stores, but you are paying for the cute little environment that you hanging out at.  I actually like the fact that they have minimal dessert list.  The less choices is sometimes better.  I don't think of Cafe Princess as a dessert place.  You want killer options, go to Demetres.  I think of it as an actual Cafe, you know, place to get away from the norm and hang out, just chit-chat, regardless of what you have.    Actually, this may be a cute date place because if you ever hit that awkward silence moment, you can always be like, \"Hey, check out those decorations on the windows...neat huh\".     Dating tips aside, the drink was good, the dessert is a cake or other goodies you can get at your local grocery.  It's a nice place to hang out, I recommend it as a hang out place."}
{"text":"Well, this place they have perfect view. My boyfriend and me sat next to the window and can look down on the street, different view from other place. They don't have much bubble tea selection. Instead, their coffee is awesome. They have most tasty and perfect green tea milk tea too. The decoration was nice but the chair and sofa have little bit stand on it. It really quite, not much people over there. It's a good spot to come when you need to relax and enjoy hot drink with beautiful view."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Awesome date place with a partner or friends. The drinks are delicious (green bubble tea, or green tea latte are a must!) and the desserts are to die for! Their waffles are delicious and fluffy (I get the princess waffle or the green tea waffle, both have fresh sliced fruit, ice cream and whipped cream) and they have a great cake selection. All in all a cozy, cute, intimate and fun space. You can even rent board games for a dollar or two - though their selection is pretty limited.   My only complaints are the synthetic strawberry ice cream, and their prices, which are slightly above normal. I wish they had real strawberry ice cream.   All in all, this place is consistently good! I would definitely recommend it, it is my go to place for dessert and drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Cafe Princess is one of the \"older\" dessert places on Yonge and Finch.  I finally went with my friend to do some work.   My friend and I didn't go full out for the waffles and crepes, which a lot of people seemed to get.  However, we both got cake and lattes.  I had myself the red velvet cake - the slices are HUGE.  However, since my sweet tooth is going away, I couldn't finish it.  I had a green tea latte, and an earl grey tea latte the second time.  Typical lattes.  My friend had the sweet potato latte, and she really enjoyed it (I'm not a huge fan of sweet potato, but it was pretty good).  The first time we went, it was quite busy.  However, the second time I went, it was more quiet (early Friday evening) -- then it got busy and noisy again.  So, if you're planning to have a quiet evening, it MIGHT be a bit difficult, because large groups may come by in there sometimes.   Otherwise, a good place to eat cake or have dessert with a friend."}
{"text":"This is just an average dessert cafe. I got the green tea waffles and it was good. I wouldnt say WOW like I had imagined it in my mind. Just OK to good. The red velvet cake had a cream cheese frosting which just didnt jive with the red velvet. Service was good though. Decor is kind of electic or just random. I didnt understand why people love this place so much. Just average and misguided in my opinion. 2.5-3 stars."}
{"text":"I think Cafe Princess used to be a good hangout spot, but from my experience there I wasn't very impressed.  I came here just to get a drink and hangout with friend after we had finished lunch at a nearby restaurant. The cafe is located upstairs nears the Shoppers, and when we came here on a weekday afternoon it wasn't very busy. I would say the renovation is pretty cute, like a little girl's princess fantasy room, though I have to point out that the chairs are a little old and needs some maintenance/updating. The fabric sofas are a little dirty and you can tell the arm chairs are pretty worn out due to the sinking seat cushion and the torn arms rests. It is still quite comfy to sit on though.  I ordered the Americano and my friend ordered the Yam Latte. The Americano was alright and the cup was decent sized for the price of around $3.5. My friend's Yam Latte was kinda expensive at $5 and the portion is pretty small (see picture) and it didn't taste very good. The Yam Latte tasted like warm milk mixed with some yam paste, wasn't very enjoyable that's for sure. We didn't try any of the food items, but just from the prices and the photos, it didn't look as good as other dessert house nearby that also offers waffles/crepes. Their cakes at the counter did look tasty however, as they were made by another bakery.  I think there are plenty of other new and existing dessert places near the Yonge/Finch area that if Cafe Princess doesn't up its game it will lose a lot of customers. I for one will not come back for another visit."}
{"text":"Found the decor extremely cute, particularly the bears.  I came here with my long time girl friends rather than my boyfriend and we had a great time catching up on the couches :) We came here bc I was really interested in the decor & food LOL  My friends had the bubbletea (which was quite watery if you ask me...and the tapioca was too chewy).  They also had strawberry icecream & a waffle sandwich thing with chocolate spread & bananas while I had the sweet potato latte and the red velvet cake.  My friend said the icecream was okay, tasted like storebought icecream she can buy anywhere while the other one said \"it was good for no icecream\" about the waffle.  The sweet potato latte was basically just a sweet potato blended with milk, you can probably make it at home.  The red velvet cake was really good though, it was just too sweet for me by the time I was 2/3 through.  If I return, it'll likely be to try the icecream waffles or to have more cake.  Cake is pretty reasonably priced   TLDR; cake is good, drinks not so much"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now; it's a very cute and comfy place to hang out with friends. I've had many of the menu items and other reviewers can tell you about those. At this point I find myself incapable of ordering anything other than the Coffee Shaved Ice, which is probably the best bingsu I have ever had the pleasure of consuming, and about which I could wax poetic.  From its foundation of magically-textured shaved ice and the cereal and sliced almond topping to the espresso shot accompaniment intended to pour over the whole concoction, this dessert is perfection. If you're a caffeine addict, you will probably love this! It's a big portion, but believe me when I say you will want to keep it to yourself."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is cozy and quaint.  It is a relaxing place for a peaceful moment alone or with a companion.  It gave the feeling of being in ones living room.    I enjoyed the great tea shared with my daughter at this lovely spot in Toronto!  I highly recommend it for a nice quiet time to reflect or catch up on conversations!"}
{"text":"Cafe of princesses... or so one would think! Haha this place is a nice cozy place by Yonge and finch. They do have a front and back entrance, but deadly stairs going only one floor up *sad face*. Anyways all jokes aside this place is a nice chill cafe. Their menu has expanded in the past couple years. Last time I was here eas 6 years ago and let me tell you the menu is gigantic to back then!   There are a decent amount of coffee/teas, cakes, ice cream to pick from. The quality is quite good at least to me it taste quite good. Not something I'd die for but still good. The interior is quite nice. Couches and small tables everywhere and they even have board games! Although they don't look to be in the greatest condition though. The prices seem to be an average pricing amongst other cafes.   Definitely not bad but not THE greatest, but worth a try!"}
{"text":"Loved the environment and the cute decor. Went late on a Friday night and wasn't too packed but still full. Had the princess waffle and would order it again."}
{"text":"Cute joint! Great for after work or after school hang out! They have a decent selection of cakes and waffle type desserts along with large variety of cold, hot and bubble tea drinks!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Always come here for a date or double date! The food is great, but the selection of board games is very limited (there's only jenga, monopoly, and game of life). Also, you gotta pay for that and there's a minimum order per person. Everyone has to buy something which I understand cause it's a small gem I don't want anyone to loiter around. Anyway....great place! Romantic, relaxing, and I definitely feel like a princess everytime!"}
{"text":"This is a cute hidden place in K-town.  The concept of the place is an incredibly girly tea party-style cafe with bubble tea, cakes and board games.  The furniture is super girly and the washroom has cute pictures of a prince and princess.  There is also a room in the back, which is a secluded \"party room\", available for booking.  The execution of this place could be better.  The furniture is the type that you would find in a house, and I kind of feel dirty sinking in a velvety couch at a cafe especially when I can clearly see a couple making out a few couches down.  I just don't feel confident in the cleanliness of the furniture.  They charge for usage of the board games, and the selection was not impressive.  The cake selection is the La Rocca cakes available at Metro.  They have a unique selection of hot lattes and frappucinos, but it was weird tasting.  This place is a novelty type of place and I recommend checking it out if you're in the area but I feel much more comfortable at a regular modern bubble tea cafe."}
{"text":"This is a cute, little cafe that was tucked upstairs on one of the buildings on Yonge Street. I've heard so many things about this place and I've always been curious to try this place out. Although the decor is super cute and romantic, I don't see what's so special about this place. There is nothing special about the food nor does it taste particularly delicious. With that said, I do think it's a nice place to chill for a hot drink or a cold dessert. However, if you want good food, I would suggest Pastel which is down the street."}
{"text":"Updated review: it's overpriced for the quality of food. The decor and atmosphere is still nice but some of the food such as the cakes aren't even fresh. So I'm lowering my rating."}
{"text":"It was Canada Day, and I was with two of my friends(they are both Korean-Canadian like myself). They don't come to North York area often, so I thought it would be a good idea to hang out here and have dessert.   I've been here two times before, so I thought, third time is a charm! Not so.    Service: It started off nice and it went downhill from there.  When we entered, a staff greeted us. A friend of mine ordered a Strawberry Shortcake slice and the staff was coming to give it to her. On the way, a strawberry on the top dropped. She picked it up with her fingers and attempted to put it back. My friend said- No, I can't eat that. Could you please bring me another one? So she did.  The slice looked nice, but when we took bites from it, it tasted mushy. The bread was soggy and the sugar tasted like wine.   A friend of mine(who is a chef) asked when the cake was brought in, the manager said: From yesterday. She wanted to see if she can find more info about this place, so she asked the manager for the business card, and she said(bitterly) that she had no business card.   We told the manager that we could not pay for the cake that was so mushy because we could not eat it. We thanked her and left the place. (The cake that was brought before(that a staff touched) was put back in the cake shelf. Eek!)   I love Korean cafe, but I can't recommend this place to anyone after what happened here.   **Extra note:  Food: bit overpriced for what you get. What you get here is hit-and-miss. Sometimes, you'll like it, sometimes you'll hate it."}
{"text":"3.5 -- something unexpected for me. we don't have enough unique cafes around the city. let alone a place that has a good selection in desserts (ice creams, cakes, crepes, waffles).  love the decor (has full couches) and wish could come out here more often. thumbs up and hope this place sticks around."}
{"text":"Do not get their rice cake waffle. The worst ever. We only came here because Demetres was not open on thanksgiving. Absolutely dreadful. Ice cream sub par at most.   The menu is old and outdated our server told us all the pictures were old. Service super slow. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I ve been there multiple times.  Nice washrooms I have to say. Prices are a little bit hight but comparing to other cages on yonge and finch it's very reasonable. I especially liked the bubble tea there. It came in a huge cup. Service was good in general.however, if u want to order a whole cake you have to do that three days in advance. So yea. That's the cafe me and my friends go most often."}
{"text":"Came here cuz we've passed by a few times & I thought the name was adorable & just had to check it out. The decor is very cozy and would be nice place to be with your friends/special someone. It was also decorated with some valentines decor as we were there around that time. There was a heart tree w/ vday wishes.   We got to select our seats and sat on a comfy white (or should I say grey?) sofa. It's probably a little more intimate closer to the front window. The cafe was filled with the aroma of fresh waffles. Not sure how good they are as we only ordered drinks since we were stuffed from dinner. Perhaps next time. There was also a complimentary water station.  I ordered the hazelnut hot chocolate and it was very sweet and nutty. Service was prompt.  I think they can gain more revenue by offering afternoon high tea. Who wouldn't want to be spoiled and high tea at the Cafe Princess?  But then people might go over their two hour time limit."}
{"text":"My best friend and I were a regular here, for the cute environment and sweet tooth cravings. The food is mediocre, and you could definitely find something much better at Second Cup or Pastel, which is down the street. Cafe Bene opposite to Princess offers great waffles.   My point here being, it is a must \"see\" for the atmosphere with a girlfriend as it has an adorable setting. As per the food, you'll find something better, somewhere else."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here because I was craving for something sweet. They don't have their own parking spots so you may have to drive around to find one. He ordered his usual favourite which is Taro bubble tea with waffles. For myself I ordered red velvet cake and matcha slush bubble tea.   I'm not a big fan of waffles so I didn't try my boyfriend's dessert. However, the bubble teas aren't very tasty, a bit plain because they put a little too much ice. I couldn't taste the matcha at all in my drink. The tapioca is hard as car tiress!!!! The cake wasn't moist enough and it was extremely sweet that I could hardly finish it. They have limited choices and the price isn't reasonable.   But the decor is cute and cozy. It's a perfect hideaway for you and your special someone. The sofa/ couch is amazingly comfortable to the point I almost feel asleep. A nice, romantic place full with waffle-ish aroma. If you're there not during their 'traffic hour', you can get some work done or study there. The place is super comfortable! Plus, the washroom is clean!   The server was cold, I guess they are not comfortable enough to serve people who don't speak their language. They only accept cash or debit card, which is a minus.   I give this place 3/5 for its atmosphere: a place to escape from the every grind and the gloomy weather."}
{"text":"A cute little shop that's been opened for awhile now. Can't believe I've only stepped foot into this cafe now. The decors super cute and the atmosphere is relaxing and quiet. It's a cafe with a very calm yet soothing environment. There are sofas you can sit on with pillows which are super comfy. It's owned by an old couple which are super attentive and patient with all request given to them. We ordered the princess platter which came with 2 slices of cake, 2 scoops of ice cream, biscuits, and fresh fruits.   For the cakes I ordered the cookies and cream cheese cake and strawberry short cake, with cookies and cream ice cream and strawberry ice cream. While reading the reviews I was kind of disappointed but I guess reviews aren't always super accurate because the cakes were light, soft, and not too sweet which went great with the fruits which were very sweet as well. Unfortunately the ice cream was freezer burnt....  The coffee drinks were rather mediocre. There's always room for improvement! I'm definitely coming back to try the rest of the goodies on the menu!"}
{"text":"comfy and princessy cafe at Yonge and Finch area. their menus are awesome! mochi waffle is the best Asian+American infused dessert I ever had! also they make their own red bean paste for bingsoo, when other bingsoo places use canned store bought red bean paste. Their bingsoo topping is just about right.  I don't like it when toppings go crazy on every food. it distracts me from tasting natural flavors of the ingredients. it can be bit pricy but I go quality over quantity so no problem with serving portion. I really respect the owner who makes the red bean paste, and drink base (for grapefruit drinks and some other fruit base drinks)"}
{"text":"I usually end up going once a year to this place , and I've enjoyed it everytime.   Prince Range: $4-$6 for drinks. $6-$15 for desserts. Every person at your table must purchase at least 1 item. I believe waffles can be split between 2 people and be counted as 2 items.    Food Quality (Taste/Portion/Menu): 4/5 They have a large menu that has a variety of desserts, so it's perfect for the many different dessert cravings you might have! The waffles are a bit cheaper compared to other dessert places but are usually smaller. They taste pretty good and the actual waffle has different flavours, which is pretty unique compared to other places that just use a generic waffle. I love their cold drinks which include coffee based drinks and lemonades . They usually a good size and taste great! The sweet potato latte and it tasted mostly like steamed milk. The sweet potato taste was very faint, so I wouldn't recommend it.   Atmosphere - 5/5 Though I did enjoy their desserts, the atmosphere is the main draw of this place. It's a very cute looking place, perfect for small groups or dates. You're able to play board games or cards here. I wouldn't recommend it for hardcore studying cause the couches are too comfy. They have stuffed animals everywhere and most of the seats are couches. The place isn't overly big so might be best to call ahead of time. They do not have their own parking lot, so street parking will have to do.   Service - 4/5 The servers are usually really nice and welcoming and come at a regular rate to fill water. Food comes at a reasonable time and I believe they'll warn you if your order will take longer.   Would I go here again?  You know it  Lash's Reccomendations: Blue Curaco Lemonade - If you like the Blue Curaco Soda, you'll like this, it's a great combination.  Nuts Waffle - Who can say no to cookies and cream ice cream? The waffle has nuts blended into it."}
{"text":"We came here because of its convenient location right on Yonge and Finch. I got honey citrus slush this time, and it was good, but because I know how to make honey citrus slush or honey citrus tea that would taste exactly like what they served me, I felt a little appalled at having to shell out $6 before taxes and tips for a cup of honey citrus slush. I can get a jar of honey citrus (yuja in Korean; yuzu in Japanese) tea for $6. Nonetheless, I do think you pay for having a good time with a friend chatting away at a cafe. They kindly list their two wifi networks and respective wifi passwords on their menu. I thought the furniture was nice on my previous visits but I realized many princess chairs are actually in need of replacement."}
{"text":"Went there with a bunch of other dudes. I felt a bit weird because the environment is kinda girly haha I think the name suggest that ;) Dessert quality is good. Staff are nice. Will go there with less dudes next time."}
{"text":"Cute little café at Yonge and Finch area. Good for girl friend gatherings or study breaks. Décor certainly lives up to its name: princess. Everything is very pink and girly. Nice place for some selfies if you're interested.  Came here with a friend during the holidays last year; the place was nicely decorated with a Christmas tree and everything. Staff was very warm and welcoming. We sat there for a pretty long time, having a drink and chatting (and knitting) and the staff did not give us any pressure to leave whatsoever. Seating was verrryyy comfy (couches and sofas with cushions and all). Their tea is a little bit on the sweet side but not bad if you want some light refreshments. Apparently they have an array of cakes and sweets so I might visit this place again to try that out.   You'll probably come here for the atmosphere more and less the food/drinks. If you want to escape the gloomy weather for a bit, this place would be a good option."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Came on a quiet Friday afternoon with my friend. Conveniently located by finch station and located up some stairs.   Food: Ordered a iced sweet potato latte, princess waffle, and a blueberry cheesecake (they ran out of strawberry *sadface*). The sweet potato latte is yummy. It does taste like sweet potato! The princess waffle was huge! The waffles are fresh and fluffy. The blueberry cheesecake is also yummy. Since mostly everything here is $5-$6, it best be good and it sure is! For 2 petite Asian girls though, it was a LOT of food. Came out of the place like a stuffed turkey.   Service: Food came fairly quick even though there was only one person running the place. The lady spoke english so yay.   Decor: Everything here is so CUTE! The furniture, everything, fit the princess theme. It's the perfect place to go on with your special someone.  Will come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Cute place! I intended to have my baby shower here but I was discouraged by the cafe's restrictions. The party room is free to book however the staff ask that you spend a minimum of $50 for your group/booking. You cannot bring in any \"outside\" food and there is not many choices on the menu. Besides the expensive food this is a beautifully decorated Cafe - nice place to hangout!"}
{"text":"Ok the best part about this place is the cute decor. It is very pink and very princess like - unique from a lot of other cafes these days.  The downside is that the food isnt that great and everything is pretty pricey  (even for a cafe). Ive been here multiple times because it's so close to the yonge and finch karaoke places and it's open late. I feel like they often don't have something on the menu.  You can play games here too for a small fee but the selection isn't great. There are private rooms in the back too for big groups. I would call in advance if you want to use them just in case."}
{"text":"I've visited Cafe Princess countless times since my high school years at Earl Haig and it has progressively gotten worse and worse. I came here recently with my boyfriend where we ordered 2 drinks and played one game .. total came up to $15 without tax and tip.   I ordered an iced green tea latte which was the most disappointing drink I've ever had. It was icy and NOT SLUSHY (could feel the ice bits and crunch on them), but tasted mostly like watered down green tea with milk. I'd rather go to Starbucks for a venti Green Tea Frap than what I just got here.   My bf got a lychee slush which was pretty generic and standard .. I will not be coming back. Additionally, we played one game of Jenga and got charged for it with no notification beforehand. When I was in my last year of HS, games were free.   TL;DR Don't come here if you want a place to eat/drink/hang out, there are so many better places in the area to go to that are cheaper and have better service."}
{"text":"I dropped by for a late night snack since I was craving something sweet on Friday night. It was the two of us and we ordered the chocolate waffles and the blueberry cheesecakes.  The cheesecake came out first so we practically killed it before the waffles came out. The cheesecake was a little too cold so wasn't very creamy but the blueberry sauce was delicious. The chocolate waffles were delicious as well. We definitely enjoyed that one better. The waffle base was very soft and complimented well with the chocolate/vanilla ice cream.   The bill came out to about $18 which was reasonable for the area but still slightly overpriced for waffles"}
{"text":"If you want to feel like a spoiled princess, tell your man to take you here! Everything about this café is cute. The decorations, the teddy bears, the furniture, the pinkness of the whole place, and even the desserts. It actually feels kind of surreal. The best seats are the couches, it's comfy and cozy - great for cuddling ;)  The stairs to the café is located in the front and back of the plaza right on Yonge & Finch (same plaza as Crazy Wings). There is paid parking in the back, but because we always come here after 9pm, it's free parking in the front (on the streets). So don't waste that $3!    Their menu is quite extensive in my opinion, at least extensive enough. The waffles were beautifully presented and really delicious! The princess waffle comes with fruits and a choice of 2 flavours of ice cream - green tea, strawberry, cookies & cream, chocolate, and vanilla. I love green tea ice cream, but I decided to go with strawberry and cookies & cream. Both were really good. The mixture of warm waffles and cold ice cream went really well together. None were overly sweet. My favourite hot drink from Café Princess would be the Sweet Potato Latte. As for cold drink, I love their Iced Green Tea Latte. Creamy and flavourful, sweet but not too sweet.  The best thing about this café is that they have board games for you in case it starts getting boring. Unfortunately, the board games are very limited and some have missing pieces. On top of that, each board game you bring back to your table, you will be charged $2.50. So I suggest you either think hard before choosing which game you really want to play or bring your own games (no charge)."}
{"text":"This place is terrible! Terrible! Terrible! The owner do not understand what is consumer service! She argues with customer with very poor attitude. We felt she was insulting us. We've ordered a Oreo cheesecake , which came with no cream cheese!!! It was simply one of those Oreo cream with 2/3 chocolate sponge cake with cream filling in the middle that you can get from longos. My friend bought this up to the owner and claimed that this is not Oreo cheesecake and the owner keep arguing that it was a cheesecake and nobody had complaint about it except us- wtf!? Is it either she don't understand what is a cheese cake or she doesn't know what she was talking about , but she is definitely the real spoiled 'princess' , and this cafe was named after her by her parents!  this place ruined our night . The waffle was nothing special not worth $9.85. The ice cream was just so so not much favor! The green tea latte  was watered down ?I am surprise this place was given 3.5 stars. If I could give negative star I could do so!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little dessert/drink place that's somewhat hidden away amid its busy Yonge/Finch setting   You have to climb up a long flight of stairs to get to it at the upper level, so not really accessible for people with physical disabilities. The space is a bit larger than it appears from outside, and is furnished with many plush couches and lounge chairs. People are encouraged to stretch out and relax, as long as they have a drink/dessert while they do so - the place has a time limit (1.5 hrs) and a minimum $ value that customers need to spend to cozy up here though.  The drinks and dessert are pretty standard to what you will find at most Asian places of this type, with BBT, coffees, teas, waffles, and cake by the slice as options. Nothing spectacular here, but still a nice place to lounge around with a group of friends or with your partner."}
{"text":"So overpriced for their food and drinks... yes I find the café cute and all, but it is a bit too \"anime-style\" kawaii, like pink ocean invasion. I tried their matcha ice cream waffle and it was too much, too sweet compared to Tsujiri that I tried in the same day. Their wifi is very slow and doesn't work well. The atmosphere is nice but I wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"A cozy place to enjoy dessert and mellow music. I like the fact that this place is relatively quiet and you can carry out a conversation easily. Mind you, I went there on a Tuesday night, and it wasn't crowded. The couches are very comfortable. The princess waffle has a rice krispy textured and not real waffle. Their sugary drinks are also very average. I give this place 3.5 stars for their cute decor, good service and free wifi. Also, I don't think anybody enjoys paying for parking. I wish they had their own free customer parking."}
{"text":"This is the place that makes me feel one step closer to living in a k-drama ^__^  Adorned with decorations that resemble a fancy tea house or a comfy classic living room, you can take you pic when choosing to sit on the overstuffed white couches or decorative wing-back chairs in this cute coffee shop located in the upper level of the shops at ynf.  Great lighting, unique decor, not too loud inside, and intimate seating (you are not rubbing elbows with the people next to you), this is a great place for your next coffee date.  The prices are a little high and the food not always cooked perfectly - on those criteria I would have given 3 starts - but the overall vibe bumps it up to a 4!  A nice change from the noisy sterile vibe of Tim Hortons :)"}
{"text":"\"Couples\" atmosphere, pricy menu, decent beverages, great desserts, dirty washrooms, and terrible service. Yay."}
{"text":"I LOVE THE GREEN TEA WAFFLES AT CAFE PRINCESS. Anytime I'm in the area this is my go to dessert!! Unlike other places, the green tea powder is actually infused in the waffle batter so that the green tea flavor is much stronger and aromatic. I also like that its not overly sweet.   I've tried the strawberry shortcake which I really hoped to enjoy but the cake was somewhat dry. The strawberries and cream was not too heavy nor too sweet, perhaps ill give it another try.   Its a cozy place to hang out with friends. They have comfy couches and some board games available. Theres a good range of desserts and drinks: lattes, sherbert, bingsu, cakes all reasonably priced. Minimum 1 order per person."}
{"text":"I love how Cafe Princess set up with all those comfy sofas that you can be so relax slipping your coffee, chatting up with some friends or just doing nothing but enjoying the atmosphere of a \"tea room\".... 4 Stars  Aside from that, the cakes and pastries here becomes an afterthought... don't expect them to make you \"wow\" and want more! They tasted like some supermarket brought super sweet factory made cakes. 2 Stars  I have to say the waitstaffs here are all young and pleasant to look at.. :) even the male ones... 3 Stars"}
{"text":"Service sucks! We ordered a Hot bubble tea ended up with a Chilled bubble tea! I had a Sweet Potato Latte for 6 dollars! omg why not call it a Sweet Potato Bubble tea? I'd call it a Sweet potato milk instead. When we pointed one picture and asked the waitress what's this? She said I don't know. I would never come back to this horrible cafe any more."}
{"text":"Went in here because my friend was too lazy to look for the entrance of the Soban Cafe. This place is mediocre. I love the interior and how it gives off a cozy vibe!   Pros: the princess waffle that we ordered tasted good, the waffle was light and crisp! The green tea latte isn't too sweet, it's just right to how I like it. My friend said that the sweet potato latte was really good so she would come back for that alone. The chairs are comfy and it's a good place to read a book. Oh and the playlist that they had playing in the background was amazing!  Cons: the wifi sucked, their overpriced (the princess waffle was $10 and for a small latte was $5-6), they lacked variety in the food options, and the service was terrible. Our waitress was on her phone, was sitting around, and basically doing nothing. As we were paying the bill at the cash register, she rudely let us know that tip was not included in the bill (we both knew this and we haven't pulled out our wallets yet to give her tip) thanks for nothing lady."}
{"text":"Had two bubble teas with green apple jelly, both had really fake powered taste. The jelly on the other hand was unique and flavourful. We also ordered the waffle sandwich with banana and choco sauce. The waffle was light and fluffy but barely had an choco sauce. We played Jenga there which was fun. They have some sleezy business tactics like each person MUST order at least 1 item and cannot share. There is also a 2 hour sitting limit as well."}
{"text":"The iced green tea latte is delicious. It's not overly sweet and you can still get the green tea flavour. I highly recommend the cocoa waffle and the green tea waffle."}
{"text":"Dreadful service. Came here about 2 months ago, and I normally don't leave negative reviews but I had a bad enough experience that I'm still pissed about this Cafe even until now. First of all, my friend and I were seated at a table that had plates and napkins from the previous customer that took the waitress 10 minutes to clean. As the waitress was cleaning the table she accidentally knocked over a cup of water. She did not bother to dry the table and placed the menus in front of us on the wet table....it was hard to flip through a soaking wet menu. I had to ask several times if someone could bring us napkins or a towel so I could clean the table myself. Finally a girl comes by and just tosses us some napkins. I've worked in the food industry myself and if I were the waitress I would have apologized for the mess and would offer to help clean the table. I couldn't enjoy the food I ordered (green tea waffle - it was OK) because of how unhelpful the servers were. I will never come here again and would not recommend Cafe Princess to anyone."}
