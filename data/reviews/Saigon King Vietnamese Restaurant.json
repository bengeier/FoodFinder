{"text":"So this restaurant is new and tries to claim their food is legit by naming the restaurant *SAIGON KING* This restaurant is HUGE, i've never been to a pho restaurant this big before. I ordered a MEDIUM so called SMALL bowl of special pho noodles and damn the size was huge! For the price of 6.99 it made sense and like they say you pay for what you get. The bowl of noodles tasted okay..soup was a bit salty cuz of the fish sauce that was put in with the soup.   Also the restaurant was very cold, the waitress and the boss was wearing their coats on to serve people, didn't look too professional and for some reason i saw the heat meter set to 18 degrees C. Didn't make sense to me at first, but what the heck, I ate my bowl of noodle as i was shivering."}
{"text":"I finally ate there after viewing tens to thousands of their advertisements on the television. In the commercial they showed curry crab served on a plate. We ordered that, beef noodle soup, and grilled prawns vermicelli. They were not exceptionally good. The curry crab was no as good as expected. The meat of the crab had no taste until you dip it into the sauce. The beef noodle soup's broth was not flavorful. The grilled prawns were overcooked. Needless to say, we will not return."}
{"text":"I am glad I stayed with the Medium Special Pho ($6.99) instead of ordering the Large for an extra $1. The Medium Pho at Saigon King is huge.........  Let's see... Cold Vietnamese Coffee for $3.50 and Wait! A bottle of beer for $2.99!!! Why beer is cheaper than coffee?? What kind of world is this?? I almost want to have a beer in the middle of the day.......  How's the Pho? Though the noodle was not fresh, it was cooked properly without that nasty after taste. The broth has the taste of star anise and has good depth.  There are also some Thai and Malaysian Curry on the menu too. The prices are all quite reasonable. The service is friendly and fast.  I think I will come back for some Vietnamese Food and a beer to go with that!"}
