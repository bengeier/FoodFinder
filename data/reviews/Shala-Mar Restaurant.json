{"text":"I had the vegetable korma and really enjoyed it. My friend had butter chicken and said it was relatively good. The house wine wasn't great but our waiter was super friendly and attentive. The decor is nice. It's wasn't the best Indian I've had in my life but it was good and I would go back and rye it higher except for....  

THE PRICE! The main drawback is it IS quite pricey. I was shocked our dinner was over $60!!! I've had the same meal elsewhere (and better!) and it was $40 so I was disappointed. The food is good but it wasn't a $60+ meal. They need to re-evaluate what they're charging or they will lose customers. This isn't Yorkville. Other than that, it's a decent place with tasty Indian food."}
{"text":"Drive by and place caught my friends eye.    Server was a delight and the Food all freshly prepared was FANTASTIC !     

A must visit restaurant in roncesvalles"}
{"text":"Ok to re-iterate other reviewers, the owner(s) are very nice people... the food is sometimes average but sometimes great - but because it is a little expensive - and Indian food generally is - it remains a gamble.  The atmosphere is generally nice though - and I do wish them luck because they along with all the other Ã¬ndie`businesses along Roncy are suffering due to the on-going construction.  Seriously, is anyone keeping count of the number of businesses that have gone under since the renovation process began?  Quite disgraceful - the local council should be ashamed of themselves.

Oops I digress.  Sorry - back to Indian food... If you truly want a good one, then you have to get over to  its` native home to find a good restaurant or take-away; yep... that would be England.  Home of many Indian dishes that for some strange reason don`t make it on to 99% of menus over here (Canada).  Boo"}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere and service were all excellent. It's a bit pricey for dinner but the lunch specials are always a good value."}
{"text":"I live across the street so I went here and unfortunately it is not good. The stuff tends to taste the same, and the prices...  I remember it being very expensive, almost robbery.

The service is a little obnoxious but friendly.

On the positive side, they do have some interesting, less common menu items (not everyone wants butter chicken!). Hopefully they make some improvements and survive their financial difficulties."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend, we ordered aloo palak, mataar paneer, pilaw rice, as well as some samosas and naan. Cost $40 dollars before tip.

Samosas and rice was good, the rest was a bit of a let-down. I've had much better Indian food, and I was expecting more because of the price and the atmosphere.

The atmosphere of the place is great, and I liked the older Indian man who served us (I get the sense that he owns the place).

I won't come back here because the food simply wasn't worth the price. I'll go to Banjara instead, near Christie pits."}
{"text":"Not only was the food disgusting, it was terribly expensive. Stay far away from any chicken dish - the quality of the meat is awful - and unless you like bell peppers stay away from the vegetable dishes.

I have no idea how this place has survived the Roncesvalles construction. Yes, the owner is a nice guy, but $60.00 for a borderline inedible meal just felt like a mugging."}
{"text":"Food quality is so so. Prices are hi. And we left \"me n my gf\" semi empty tummies:((
Will think twice before going back"}
