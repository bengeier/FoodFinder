{"text":"With no doubt the classiest bar in Montreal , the charm of the old place , the marvelous wood and marble work give this place a class by it's own . Everything about the bar is fantastic except the slow service ,the restaurant is little disappointing , the quantities are too small , the waiters are friendly but not well trend . I guess things will get better with time"}
{"text":"WOW! The restaurant is stunning!! The food was incredible and the service was excellent. When you go (and you really should go), walk upstairs to see the old mansion."}
{"text":"I went here with a girlfriend for post dinner drinks after seeing this place featured in a magazine.  I was really looking forward to coming here and it definitely did not disappoint. The place is absolutely beautiful, classy and had a very nice ambience.    Staff was attentive and helpful and not at all pretentious as you'd expect a place like this to be.  The cocktails were selected by our bartender based on what flavor profile and liquor we preferred.  And of course, they were delicious.   Overall, a great experience and highly recommended if you're in the Montreal area.  There's a restaurant as well, the menu looks nice but we only ordered the cheese platter as we'd already had dinner."}
{"text":"What I like most about the place was the quaint British atmosphere . All the walls and ceiling are covered with dark brown wood with a large number of paintings and photos hanging everywhere. Foodwise, the portion are not too big neither too small, the quality of the foods is solid standard, but you won't taste extraordinary flavors."}
{"text":"We popped by for a cocktail before dinner elsewhere. Yow. What a space. Absolutely gorgeous. Just go look at it (and have a cocktail). Cocktail menu is clever and fun and they had some interesting takes on some classics. Nicely made cocktails - we had a 'White Lady' (pretty darn tasty) and a riff on a Boulvardier (if my memory serves me correct) The space is great. The staff was warm and friendly. No complaints!"}
{"text":"George full English is really nice! Love the mushrooms and black pudding. Environments were good also, you could really enjoy the brunch time there."}
{"text":"Bar George opened about four months. It used to be a private club for a while, which you can immediately see upon entering. There is a dining room and a bar downstairs, and a couple of private dining and meeting rooms in the building. There is a large bar as well, and small tables by the window in the same room as the bar. There is also a patio.   We received superb, 5-star service there. Our server went over the menu and answered our questions in detail. He was  knowledgeable about the food, as well as the history of the place. He also made sure that our specific requests/modifications are met exactly.   The food was very good and came out very quickly. The menu was straightforward and included a few fish options. We had the atlantic mackerel and the black pudding agnolotti. The mackerel was very tender and delicious, with tasty sides. The agnolotti was very good too.   We went there for lunch and didn't get drinks or desserts. I am already making plans for my next visit to try out the whiskey pudding!"}
{"text":"We decided to try the restaurant attached to our hostel for breakfast. The food was very good, but the selections are a little limited.  The staff were very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"What a beautiful place to have a nice breakfast. I went with fellow yelpers to go to Bar George. The service was amazing they have a lot of staff who always made sure that I had water, coffee and tea. As well asked if I liked the food.   They made some options on the menu Vegan for me. I chose the avocado toast it had a great relish under which gave it a nice taste to it. The service was also very fast from the kitchen. They have a great Americans and with the tea they have a full pot not just a cup !   They have beautiful washrooms, parking is on the street which is free on Sundays. The only downfall with the price for a tea, coffee and two avocado toast was $30 which included the tip. It wasn't horrible but a tad high. But you get your money's worth here.   Check it out for a fancy occasion."}
{"text":"What a beautiful house! This place is so gorgeous it makes every occasion special. I went there for lunch, had the steak, which was very good, and a great dates& whiskey pudding for dessert. Great service as well. But what makes it special really is the house interiors. It's stunning, but cozy and comfortable at the same time."}
{"text":"Le bar George m'avait été recommandé par un maitre d'hôtel alors que je cherchais un lieu sympa et 'différent ' pour y emmener un visiteur venu d'Europe. C'était en plein hiver et on m'avait vanté le côté chaleureux, chic et totalement approprié pour un ami venu d'Ecosse. Finalement j'y suis allée pour la première fois un dimanche de printemps, non pas pour les cocktails mais pour un brunch. Le decor est grandiose, installé dans un ancien 'gentleman's club' on sent l'histoire du lieu de par le choix des peintures accrochées au mur, les coloris choisis, les grandes cheminées bourgeoises. Le decor est joli mais manque un peu de lumière naturelle, probablement que l'hiver c'est effectivement idéal. Nous avons commandé sur le menu du brunch et tout le monde a rapidement trouvé quelque chose qui le tentait. J'ai pris une assiette dejeuner avec un morceau de boudin noir. Les portions etaient correctes, suffisantes, pas extravagantes mais le plat en soit n'avait rien d'exceptionnel. Bon, mais pas au point de me dire que je veux y retourner manger un brunch parce que finalement les assiettes étaient assez dispendieuses en comparaison d'autres places à déjeuner offrant des mets similaires. Le service était très professionnel et la salle à manger très calme, ideale pour un groupe familial ou meme un couple de visite à Montréal pour le WE.  Je tenterai peut-être le bar un soir car c'est pour cela que ce lieu m'avait été recommandé initialement. Plutôt l'hiver."}
{"text":"Super belle place pour dejeuner! Les plats etaient très bon , mais ce qui fait toute la difference c'est vraiment le look du restaurant ! Comme ce petit resto est directement dans le mount stephen, c'est une bonn opportunité de vivre le luxe de cette hotel sans avoir a payer le gros prix des chambres!   Bref, j'ai ete grandement impressionné !"}
{"text":"Probably the most elegant bar to have drinks at in the area! Bar George offers an awesome environment for drinks with friends! Judging by the crowd, it was a popular after work spot for professionals. The bar's detailing is exceptional and it's bartenders appreciate their craft. Hats off to them - they made delicious drinks and were more than willing to go off the menu and accommodate each persons tastes.   Slight issue is the crowding. It isn't a huge space, so it can be a bit uncomfortable if not seated at the bar or peripheral tables. They do a good job with controlling traffic (a hostess has a list for bar seats. If you put your name down you will get a seat). We waited about 15 mins (not bad!) for our seats, which was perfect since e were hovering some people at a table near the window!"}
{"text":"Bar George- for anyone who has attended McGill, this building resembles one of the many faculty clubs owned by the University. It screams McGill even though it's part of a hotel.   I came here on a Saturday afternoon for brunch. Walking in the bar is located on the left, the main dining hall is straight a head, followed by the hotel entrance on the right. The decor is beautiful- classic and hand carved wooden ceilings decked with chandeliers. I won't like lie- the dining hall is very dark. It almost a feels you're part of Harry Potter's dining Hall and I magically need a wand to  light the place up. I wouldn't have picked this venue for summer- too dreary.  The menu is simple yet overpriced. I ordered the avocado toast for around 20$ that is a popular dish reading from yelp. I'm south Asian and this dish did not settle well in my mouth - chutney on avacado toast doesn't make it fancy people! To wash out the aftertaste I thought a 5$ freshly squeezed juice would do the trick. To my surprise - the portion of the juice is what you get in a happy meal. For a Virgin drink - Let's be nice Bar George and serve bigger portions! Although, the side order of buttermilk scones for 4$ was totally worth the price if not more as it is served with a variety of fruit spreads.  My bill came out to 27$ for 3 dishes. I was hoping for a better brunch menu for the price I paid, but maybe a dinner soiree will have prove me wrong."}
{"text":"My only NICE sit-down dinner while visiting Montreal for a conference was here.  I was taken out by one of our previous vendors who was also at the conference to this restaurant with a few others so I dined here this past week with a small group.  We had wine, appetizers, dinner, and dessert so we experienced it ALL here!  I had the butler steak for my main course/dinner, it was very good, and I even got to try a few things I've never had before. For starters, when we were greeted we got a brief background of the place which was really nice and made the place and experience even more appealing.  Our server had the cutest accent and we loved hearing her explain the menu options and answering our questions we had about the menu.  The menus here are in French & English so again...super helpful.  This place is beautiful - make sure to visit the second floor where the bathrooms are as it really looks similar to a church!  Everyone is very friendly here, the place is SO nice and the food is great too.  Most people were dining outside, but we dined inside as that is where the beauty of this place really is!  I DO recommend dining here."}
{"text":"I returned to Montreal after being away for the summer to find out that this place opened up around the corner from me. It's inside the Mount Stephen hotel, a boutique hotel in a restored historic building. I decided to stop by for breakfast.   The first thing that strikes you is the space itself. The wood-panelled walls, plush carpet and hardwood floors, and marble countertops evoke the grand hotels of a century ago. You have the option of eating either in the dining room or at the bar. I chose the bar for the more open space and brighter lighting, since I was there for breakfast.   The menu is simple and well-curated. Given the British pub theme, they have the usual suspects, along with the full English breakfast. I opted for the omelette forestière, with mushrooms, lardons, spinach, Emmental, and duck fat potatoes, along with a side of their breakfast sausage. I was seriously impressed with everything. The omelette was properly executed, not overcooked, and the filling was the right mix of crispy and gooey. The duck fat potatoes were excellent, with a slightly crisp, caramelized outside encasing a creamy interior. The sausages seemed house made, and had a nice herbal seasoning to them.   Service-wise, business was slow when I was there, and even though the staff was taking advantage of the down time to prepare for the lunch and dinner rushes later that day, they were friendly and attentive.   I'm definitely looking forward to a return visit for dinner soon."}
{"text":"Beautiful place for brunch with an exceptional staff ! They made sure everything was perfect !! I feel like I stepped back in time! The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting yet elegant and romantic. The avocado toast was perfect and the full English breakfast was huge! Mimosas and cappuccino are a must try! We sat at the bar and the seats are so comfy ! The warm jazzy frank Sinatra music in the background while sipping cappuccino made me feel like royalty in this beautiful setting! Don't skip this place!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with friends for brunch. I'd actually give three stars for the food, drinks and service, but the setting bumps it up an extra star. We started with tea and a scone, which was to die for--definitely get the scones! But it was downhill from there. We got the eggs benedict, omelet, and hash. It was all good, but we weren't blown away by anything. And the service was slow and surprisingly inattentive for a venue like this. It's definitely worth a visit for the ambience alone--and be sure you check out the rest of the mansion while you're here. Just don't expect the food to match the decor."}
{"text":"The venue is beautiful and rich. Very cozy atmosphere. The bar area is far too loud for a conversation. The music can be turned down a bit and still have a party/festive atmosphere. We were 8 for a birthday dinner in the main dining room which is really lovely. The cocktails were quite good (Golden Square Mile Sour & Lady Stephen) while pricey. The mushroom soup was beautifully flavoured but should have been thinned out as it was almost like a thick puree. The fish dishes were good but we found the accompaniments way too salty whether you had the organic salmon or Icelandic cod.  Overall the dishes weren't memorable for the prices charged. The chocolate and ginger tart was delicious and the warm whisky pudding with ice-cream is very sweet and rich. A few bites is all you need! I would come back here for brunch or afternoon tea or even drinks as it's such a nice environment. Valet parking is available for $15 or if you go after 6pm on a Tues/Wed you can park around the corner on De Maisonneuve at an outdoor lot of $6."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect- the old fashion, welks appetizer, cod cake with the delicious little caviar. We even made time for a rich chocolate tart with ginger sorbet. Everything was spectacular and the building itself is worth a visit. I wish I would have taken photos but I couldn't stop myself from eating enough to remember."}
{"text":"Oh wow! Bar George reminds me of Renaissance Hotel in London. What a gorgeous place! The wooden wall, British renaissance furniture, beautiful designed utensils. This decor just blown my mind.  Our server Alex was just wonderful, entertaining and super helpful.   I ordered the roasted cauliflower salad with spinach vinaigrette which was today's special. Then I had salmon gravlax with crumpet, on the side a perfect Pinot Grigio. Each bite of my food was simply amazingly delicious. The portions were perfect. I didn't feel over bloated, that I actually had space for a little desert (whiskey pudding) and a latte. It was another delish dish!   It is slightly over priced but you know the quality is far superior, and each presentation of each dish was breathtaking.   I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"My family and I went at Bar George on Christmas Day 2017 during a vacation to Montreal. I hadn't realized that Bar George was a restaurant in a hotel until we got there but don't let that deter you. Firstly, the hotel and restaurant are beautiful. When you enter there is an ornate wooden staircase which was perfect for Christmas day post dinner pictures. The entry was also beautifully decorated for the holiday. Every staff member we interacted with was friendly and very helpful, especially regarding the menu.   The food was fantastic. We all started our with cocktails that were a twist on traditional English drinks. As a gin lover I really appreciated the cocktail selection. Our server suggested the scallops with blood pudding ravioli which was delicious, I would definitely recommend this dish. Everyone in our party enjoyed what they ordered for dinner and we got three desserts to share. We got the George's mess which is their play on Eton Mess, the pumpkin pie, and the whiskey chocolate cake. I had wished the George's mess had more meringue but all the desserts were rich and delightful. I would definitely recommend Bar George to visitors of a Montreal."}
{"text":"Bar George in the mount Stephen club is a beautiful restaurant, much of its style coming from the historic building. Given that the restaurant just opened, I have to say the service was really good. The food wasn't outstanding but still solid. Nothing too creative on the menu, but still tasty. I would easily go back."}
{"text":"Exquisite decor and top notch service. The menu, though not very extensive, offers some classic British dishes. We had the burger, scotch egg and chicken pot pie and they were all perfectly executed."}
{"text":"Great experience tonight with my wife. Service at the bar was impeccable, same for the dinning room. Breathtaking setting, simply gorgeous. You find yourself looking at all the different details on the walls. The food was delicious. We will without a doubt be back, this is a keeper."}
{"text":"Where do I start, Bar George gives me all the feels. It's beyond exceptional.   This once home of business mogul turned exquisite boutique hotel offers fine relatively affordable dining. Also learned it's a national historic site in Montreal. It's like walking into a museum. The space is absolutely breathtaking.  The 4 of us were lucky to snag a spot for brunch without a reservation on a frigid day but wouldn't chance it next time.  We all loved our meals:     -Full English Breakfast      -Haddock Hash     -Eggs Benedict      -Beetroot Salad (disliked beets until this dish)  Just wish we had time to return for a drink at the gorgeous bar!"}
{"text":"It really is one of the most mesmerizing and whimsical bar in Montreal!!! It feels like you are in a museum with the amazing decor and architecture. The drinks menu is pretty classic and there are several couches and lounge chairs as well as bar stools. It's not too loud and perfect for having conversations. The bar food menu is a little unusual with more English dishes. I give it 5 stars due to ambiance, decor and great service!!!"}
{"text":"We were in a shopping center on Rue McGill College looking on Yelp for a place for lunch with outdoor seating nearby.  This was less than a 10 minute walk away and had an interesting menu. It is located a little out of the way from the hustle of downtown, with a big shaded outdoor patio set back and above the street.  Lovely spot.  Two of us shared the following:  a bottle of Pinot Grigio (hey, don't judge, we are on vacation after attending a conference!), the beetroot salad, tuna crudo appetizer, and the cod cake.  We ended the meal with a pair of soy lattes.  Everything was INCREDIBLE.  It was all beautifully presented and amazingly tasty.  Such great textures, colors, and flavors.  Neither too heavy nor too virtuous.  So many fresh herbs on everything.  So creative yet restrained.  Even the lattes were particularly tasty.  The service was also great.  Friendly and attentive.  You must come here."}
{"text":"Amazing elegant decoration, and great hardwood aroma. We had an English full breakfast,  poached eggs avocado toast, and Benedictine eggs. Food with healthy portions was good and Black pudding was cool. They have a few non-alcoholic beverage selections. The price of brunch is reasonable without wine. Attentive staff."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about this place that I had to try it out with my foodie friends. If you love history and visiting historical places..bar George should definately be on your list. Situated on Drummond Street, this majestic home is most certainly a site for sore eyes. A handsome smiley doorman welcomes it's guests into this beautiful stone walled mansion. Stepping into the former Mount Stephen's Club is like walking back through time. Stunning hand crafted wooden walls and marble fireplaces...makes you feel like you are in a fairy tale place. What is most awesome is that they do allow guests to visit the second floor to get a glimpse of the rest of the mansion. We went for Sunday brunch and loved the whole experience. The food itself is good but it's being in the mansion that adds to the overall experience. Will definately go back to try the 5@7 at the bar area! We went on a Sunday 10am and easily found parking on the street...no parking meter fee until 1pm on Sundays. Reservations are required."}
{"text":"Wowza. Thats pretty much what I said when I walked into this restaurant. I cannot even begin to describe the beautiful decor. The chandeliers, the stained glass windows, the paintings etc... Definitely a photographer's dream. The service was excellent. We had a very friendly and attentive waiter who explained the menu to us. The food was very unique and delicious. I had the fish crumpet and the cauliflower salad. Together these two dishes were filling and a treat for the tastebuds. I never expected to like a cauliflower salad. In fact these two dishes were unlike anything I have had. The dessert looked incredible as well. While it is a bit pricey, I think the food is definitely unique and well put together."}
{"text":"Bel endroit et beau décore à l anglaise. Très bon service ,  Gâteau au chocolat et son sorbet vraiment délicieux à essayer absolument"}
{"text":"Not a lot of room around the counter, but the Georges bar is definitely a warm, fine old fashion place with a touch of 'eyes wide shut' interior design. The burger we ordered (the bar's bites) is definitely a go, so as the devil's horseback bouchées (bacon was a bit over cooked tho). Waiters are nice. So are their cocktails!"}
{"text":"Wow. That about sums it up.  My cousins brought me here late one recent stormy blizzard-y night for drinks in the bar. Being a native Montrealer, I thought I was familiar with the downtown core and all its offerings. But I had never heard of this mind-blowing bar and attached restaurant, or the exquisite hotel it is housed in. (In my defense, I've been living in Seattle the past 25 years, and now Vancouver. But STILL...).  Entering this establishment, you really feel like you are entering an upper-crust \"gentleman's club\" lounge from another era. Think: an exclusive bar for aristocrats out of a Sherlock Holmes novel. That's what I imagined, anyhow, with the deep wood paneling, Victorian architectural embellishments, pillars and cornices and engravings abound, coffered ceiling, commanding central bar, upholstered plush armchairs in many intimate niches, even inlaid buttons on the walls (we asked: they used to be used to \"summon\" the servers, but they've been deactivated). SO COOL. So genuinely retro. This is how drinking in a bar used to be, in a more gilded age.   I was so impressed with the bar that my cousins asked the hostess in the lobby if we could check out the restaurant. She gladly escorted us inside, where I marveled at the beautiful ambiance, which was similar to the bar. Very \"old world\" and intimate. Lovely fireplace there. Just a warm and intimate dining ambiance. Looking at the menu, I'm already planning on dinner here when I next visit town. Fine dining all the way.  We next visited the adjacent lobby of the hotel where we spoke to a young man behind the main counter. What a nice guy! He was so personable and very happy to be working there (his words! But it was evident in the pride he had with this beautiful hotel, and to be working in the city of Montreal. He was originally from Israel, as I recall). Just a super nice guy. The hotel label was surprisingly contemporary, being a few steps away from the old-fashioned elegance of polished wood and traditional architectural details of the bar and restaurant a few steps away. There was a huge electronic monitor on the wall, and a minimalistic front desk with sleek polished flooring. It made for an intriguing juxtaposition of aesthetics with the other areas we visited - but not unpleasant. Interesting! Looking at the photos on the monitor of the various guest rooms and suites available, I thought this would be an optimal hotel for out-of-towners. Lots of room options, and being in the heart of downtown, with such a gorgeous bar and restaurant attached, would be the ultimate."}
{"text":"I was looking very forward to trying out Bar George because of the delicious looking brunch items and the decor. The only thing I was impressed with was the decor. Everything else was a bit of a bit of a letdown - but then again, it could be because of what I ordered. The chia pudding was average at best. The British coffee was good - the booziness definitely helped to offset the otherwise unimpressing taste of the chia pudding. I coughed like crazy during the beginning of my brunch and made a mess on the table - the server did not even come to ask if I was okay. He just stood there and spoke with another server. It was only when I gave them eye contact that one of them decided to come over and help clean up the bits of cream that I coughed up. Service was, as a whole, aloof and inattentive. I wouldn't be opposed to coming back but I'll definitely try out more heartier dishes like the Full English Breakfast or chicken pot pie."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch only, so I can't tell you about the bar or dinner. First of all, you are greeted with a gorgeous Victorian building that feels incredibly classy and elegant. However, the atmosphere was pretty laid back and unpretentious. We were seated at the bar and they also had a coat check. Service was fast and friendly! We watched them make drinks as people just sat around the oval shaped bar. Tried not to stare at the people across the table :| I got the george's full English, which reminded me of my time enjoying brunches in the UK. All the components were very well done, the beans, mushrooms, bacon, eggs, tomatoes and black pudding. Everything was seasoned perfectly. I think this was the first time I've had black pudding outside of England and honestly it was more delicious. I also got to try the haddock hash, and it was excellent as well. The prices are reasonable for a typical brunch, just a little pricier (tea was $4). It was definitely worth the experience and I'll probably go back to see what other English fare they serve up! (They have chips with curry sauce!!)"}
{"text":"We were last night for dinner. Beautiful place, great music. It's definitely a nice place to be and eat. The food we had it was a bit heavy ( British food) but the drinks were great. Bread it was delicious. It seems like the bar it's a great and fun place to be. Food and service was great, beautiful people around eating and working, but it seems like it would work better for us if we ate earlier since the food it's kind of heavy. Don't get me wrong, I will definitely be back, but maybe for a lighter dish or salad. It's definitely worth it eating there for so many reasons."}
{"text":"Beautiful cuisine in a beautiful place.  Luc is the best server ever. I called to ask if he could serve  on my family and I because I really wanted to make an impression and he totally went beyond my expectations.  The food is absolutely fantastic,  as good as any 5 star restaurant in Montreal, which is saying something.  I loved the boudin noir canneloni/scallop/ cauliflower dish.  It was so imaginative and the flavors went together so well."}
{"text":"Absolutely unbelievable environment! Beautiful woodcraft on the ceiling, endless rows of photos and paintings on the walls, stylish yet comfortable armchairs and sofas, unique ornamented plates, posh silverware. If I live in Montreal, I'll go there just to enjoy the atmosphere.  Unfortunately, I can't say a lot about the food. We weren't hungry, so we haven't eaten much: me and my wife both ordered mushroom soup and some pastry, adaughter has got pain perdu (some kind of a cake with variety of berries). Soup was great, with distinct, sharp yet smooth taste of mushrooms and soft texture. Pastry was quite good, but pain perdu was way above it. Those who count calories should stay away from that cake.  My only complaint is about latte. Not about coffee itself, but the size of the cups. They were too small, so I had to order two.  Will definitely go there when I come to Montreal next time."}
{"text":"Bar George is a part of a very beautiful historic bldg with matching decorations. The food is always tasty, presented nicely, and at a reasonable price. Drinks I find are a bit expensive, better suited for a peaceful cozy evening outing rather than a drunk night! Servers are almost always attentive, kind and helpful. I've been to bar george a few times. For a lunch date, for drinks and snacks with friends, and for lunch with colleagues and so far everyone has enjoyed the bldg, the ambience and the food. The food is not quite 5star, but the settings add a magical character to this place that is worth more than 1 extra star :)"}
{"text":"While vacationing here in Montreal with my boyfriend we stubbled across Bar George and figured we'd give it a try. The exterior and interior are absolutely beautiful so we were excited for the experience we were about to have.   The food is fresh and each plate has such a great balance of flavors. We first came for lunch and loved it so much that we made dinner reservations for the next evening. Do yourself a favor, whether it's just to stop by for a drink or have meal, you won't regret your visit to Bar George."}
{"text":"Bar George is absolutely beautiful inside a historical house. It's inside Le Mount Stephen hotel.  The bar itself isn't big. It has one round of chairs around the bar in the center, with some lounge sofas around the corner.   I haven't tried their food there, but the drinks menu is quite good with cocktails, and other usual options. The ambiance is more lounge than a club. The music isn't super loud and it's a great place for conversations. Not to mention the amazing interior decor."}
{"text":"We stumbled across Bar George while walking through the city and we were not disappointed!  Once we ordered we could watch our bartender making our drinks and after he finished one of them he tasted it and poured it out. This guy cared a lot and the quality showed, all of our drinks were fantastic.  The staff are also very friendly! We chatted with them for some time and before we left they gave us dinner recomm ndarions, not only for one place but for 5 different genres of food, so nice!  Highly recommend Bar George for drinks!"}
{"text":"Thankfully this place was not far from our stay in Montreal. We stopped in for late night cocktails and the atmosphere was great. unique drinks and friendly staff. We came back later on in the weekend for brunch which was also very good. Avocado toast with poached eggs was everything. Get the side of Toronto bacon and soak in the salty goodness! The decor of this place is quite interesting. A very historic place ringing true to its vintage look with slightly modern pieces. Cool vibe at night, but nice for brunch. Try to go if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"TL;DR Beautiful room, friendly service, no vegetarian options in the Bar Bites.  I was responsible for picking a spot for a 4pm bite before an event for a few members of a panel I had put together at McGill University on Ending Poverty in Canada. I picked Bar George based on the reviews, location, and the fact we were able to make a reservation at such a weird hour - I know a reservation isn't necessary at 4pm on a Tuesday, but we had a Canadian Senator coming and wanted everything locked down, if only for our own anxiety.   I got there a bit before my guests and was delighted by the spectacularly beautiful room and the perfect, warm service. And then I found out that, very reasonably, we were between the lunch and dinner menus and would only be able to order from the Bar Bites. There were lots of delicious sounding options, but nothing vegetarian at all - everything had fish or meat - except for the French fries, but we needed something substantial before our event! Yikes! I asked about vegetarian options, and told the waitress my concern. She said, I think I saw on your reservation you are coming with a Senator? In that case, if she needs something that's not on the menu, we'll hook her up.   Which was super nice. And I'm glad to know they can accommodate powerful people.... But but but. True class and high level hospitality is treating everyone at that high level.   Anyway.   I ate the curried fish on crumpets, and the cheese on the Ploughman Platter and they were totally freaking delicious. I loved the service from every single person I interacted with, and as the bar started to fill up with 5a7 crowd I got the impression this could be a really fun, classy place to come for drinks if you want to feel fabulous.   And the lunch and dinner menus have salads and other vegetarian options I think, so no stress. Just a moment that left me thinking about how class can determine access to healthy, sustainable options... and a Yelp review seemed an appropriate place to share. ;)"}
{"text":"We came to this bar for three of our four nights in Montréal. What a fantastic bar. Stunning decor and atmosphere, beautiful building, friendly, unpretentious staff. Prices not as sky-high as you would expect from a bar in the lobby of a five star hotel. Easily and quickly became one of our favorite bars in any city. The music was different every weeknight we visited (ranging from 80s to jazz) and was a little more upbeat when we visited on a Saturday. (Also much more crowded!) My suggestion, wrap up a day of shopping at around 4 with a seat at or around the bar."}
{"text":"Awesome English meal in Montreal. Loved the Scotched egg. The beef Wellington was done perfectly. The Bar and the dining areas alone are worth the visit. Great place to be."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Bar George is nestled in the hotel. It only has brunch menu on the weekends. Pretty decor with an upscale vibe. A bit expensive. Friendly service. VERDICT: I recommend if you are looking for a classier and clean restaurant.  My friends and I ordered the scotch egg and beets salad. Both were good. I had never tried a scotch egg before and it was definitely interesting. The meat surrounding the egg was seasoned well but had too much breading for me. However, I did like the crispy bite of the meat encasing the velvety egg. The beets salad was refreshing and tossed in a light vinaigrette. Had a much needed acidity to the overall meal. It was a great contrast against the savoury scotch egg.  Our server was so friendly and sweet. He was really attentive and made sure that all our needs were met. We did not have a reservation but he seated us immediately despite the lunch wave that was about to come through."}
{"text":"J'ai trop trop adoré l'endroit, on se croirait dans un vieil immeuble à Londres; c'est de toute beauté!  J'y suis allée pour le déjeuner et bien qu'ils soient assez traditionnels, ils sont délicieux! J'ai pris le pain doré, qui est plus un pain perdu, aux petits fruits et crème anglaise; c'était merveilleusement bon! Mon copain a pris le full english breakfast et tout était très bon!  C'est pas très cher pour un déjeuner, les assiettes sont entre 12$ et 20$ ! Le café est bon, le service est excellent et je vous jure, l'endroit est fantastique!!"}
{"text":"Really beautiful and elegant establishment with the most delicious food. We came here for brunch and everything was absolutely delicious! Would return again! It was a very special experience.   I had the poached eggs with avocado on toast with chutney. Really delicious!"}
{"text":"From Ft Lauderdale FL. Here for F1 weekend, this was the most incredible atmosphere for the wildest F1 weekend in Montréal. The lamb shank, octopus, foi gras is amazing. Thank you Montréal for an amazing weekend, you've outdone yourselves!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and it was so wonderful! We didn't have a reservation and had no problem sitting at the bar. Great service, cool atmosphere, and awesome menu. Started with a croissant and holy moly was it good. Love the little jars of jam it is served with! Got the avo toast with poached egg and it was wonderful. Boyfriend got the omelette and he was over the moon. Highly recommend and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great food and great drinks ... what else can you ask for?  Located in the Le Mount Stephen hotel, this dining establishment features a dining room and a bar - both of them with very a very distinct old-world feel, given the fact they are housed within an old mansion.    I had breakfast, dinner and drinks here and all of the experiences were top notch.  Breakfast - the haddock hash is fantastic.  I strongly recommend that Item though keep in mind it is most definitely a very heavy item, especially in the morning.  I was also a fan of their coffee ... good stuff.  Dinner - I opted for the cornish hen given all the rave reviews.  The dish did not disappoint.  The chicken was tender, well cooked and the pastry was a nice touch.  The tuna crudo appetizer was also delish and flavorful."}
{"text":"Un gros WOW pour le décor et pour l'ambiance. Le restaurant George à l'intérieur de l'hôtel Mount Stephen a vraiment investi afin de créer ou plutôt de respecter une atmosphère d'époque. On peut facilement imaginer le club privé qui existait à l'époque afin de réunir des hommes d'affaires de la haute société, Le côté anglais y est bien respecté tant sur le décor que dans l'assiette. On retrouve plusieurs salles différentes ou l'on peut manger, une première près de l'entrée plus sombre, plus intime. Puis, on perçoit après le long et imposant escalier en bois, une autre salle avec de belles boiseries, des peintures un peu partout et des bancs d'époque également. Finalement, un peu au centre, le bar, un bar ovale fait de bois et marbre vert qui donne envie d'un bon cocktail et de se retrouver entre collègues après une journée de travail ou d'inviter un rendez-vous galant afin de faire chic. Bref, l'endroit est impressionnant et le service est soigné comme il le devrait mais aussi comme on en a besoin. Un portier vous ouvre la porte de façon courtoise. On vous accueille devant le restaurant et le service en salle est tellement attentionné, on ne vous oublie pas. Nous avons testé leur brunch du week end. J'ai pris leurs toasts aux ufs pochés, avocat et tomates. Avec en accompagnement une salade de fruits en extra a 5$. Les toasts étaient très bonnes quoi que j'ai trouvé l'avocat beaucoup trop acide, vraiment trop. On y aura peut-être mis trop de citron... La tartinade à la tomate (si je ne me trompe pas)était quant à elle délicieuse et douce. Elle donnait un petit goût sucré très agréable. Toute la vaisselle faisait penser à la vieille Angleterre c'était tellement plaisant!!! Ma copine a pris les ufs bénédictines. Délicieux. Les portions sont petites et ne viennent pas des accompagnements alors le plat qui vous coûte 15$ (raisonnable) devra très certainement être accompagné d'un extra (pomme de terre, viande ou fruits). Café très bon. Alors si cela vous dit de vivre un petit moment comme les personnages de Downton Abbey GO FOR IT!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning! Talk about one chic brunch. As you enter you will have the bar section on your left side and the dining room in front. Staff is as friendly as can be. Very suitable for business meetings or intimate dates. We had the poached eggs on avocado toasts, omelette with potatoes and mimosas on the side. You can count on me revisiting that place."}
{"text":"Very classy place with reasonable prices. A Historical hotel , a must  to stop by and look inside"}
{"text":"This British restaurant is definitely worth checking out. This venue is gorgeous! It's classy with tons of paintings on the walls and  the bathrooms are so fancy.   The first time I came here was with my bro and my boyfriend. I found it weird that they gave us one roll of bread for three people. I asked the waiter for two extra rolls and I'm glad I did because the bread was very good. It was warm and soft and similar to a brioche. My bro had the Cornish hen. I took a bite and it was phenomenal!! Picture a beef Wellington but replace the beef with hen. It came with toasted oatmeal skirlie stuffing and traditional bread sauce. OMG!! I had the lamb sirloin with black pepper haggis, mint sauce, and potatoes. My boyfriend had the sirloin steak with Yorkshire pudding, champ,and whisky gravy. I preferred the steak to the lamb but the real winner of the night was hands down the Cornish hen. The waiter was really nice and offered us free coffee/espresso.   I liked this place so much I came back with my aunt last week. My aunt and I shared the triple chips which came with a curry sauce. The fries are big and the sauce was literally just curry and not like a curry mayo. I would not recommend it. This time around I decided to get the Cornish hen. However the waitress told us that there was a Cornish hen on the special menu and it was similar to the one on the menu except that they added asparagus. So my aunt and I got the special because hey why not get asparagus for $3 extra?! But nooooo!! It was a completely different!! The one we ended up getting did not have a pastry around the hen!! It was just a roasted hen with vegetables on top of it. I was so sad. I found out later that we were misinformed and that Cornish hen I wanted was the one on the menu. Boo!! Next time I go I will definitely not make the same mistake. The hen was good but it wasn't what I wanted. If u ever go to bar George definitely get the Cornish hen. It's a must!"}
{"text":"First of all, I love the decorations!!! It looks so fancy with the old heritage style mixing with modern twists of luxury!  The service is very nice! I got a surprise dessert because I celebrated birthday day here. Talking about the food, I was slightly disappointed by the taste with $$$$ price. I ordered cream of mushroom soup as starter, it was good. The bread tasted a little bite too salty. Then I got a main dish with shrimps and fish. It was good but again a little bite too salty.  The dessert consisted of a small cake and a ball of frozen yogurt. The frozen yogurt was tasty but the cake was toooooooo sweet!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh!!! I loved this place!!!! I am so happy with the service, food, atmosphere- just everything. So thankful as I was treating myself to a birthday trip and I'm glad that this is one of the memories I have of Montreal. It is such a beautiful and charmingly relaxing place, I just wanted to melt into the floorboards. I had the butler steak, Canadian bacon, mimosas and whiskey pudding. Everything was simply delicious!!!"}
{"text":"WOW! Talk about a beautiful place to go eat with friends and/or family.  As soon as I walked into the Mount Stephen, I felt like I was eating somewhere in England in some sort of \"victorian style\" mansion and I was no longer in Montreal! I was immediately impressed with the amount of detailing and renovations put into this place. We were greeted right away by a hostess, who sat us in such a beautiful dining room with lovely, comfortable seating. They have a great choice of cocktails to choose from. I decided to go with a classic, Pimms cup. It was delicious! The menu consists of choices of fish, steak, chicken and pork. The servings are of decent size and the food is delicious.  As we were served our plates, the waiter explained every detail about how the dish was prepared. I ordered the cornish hen. The food was delicious and I don't really have any complaints! I would definitely come back here for a birthday dinner, a 5 a 7 with friends, or before going out. The building is so lovely and all of the detailing really pays off. I do hope that their menu does change from time to time, as the menu can be a bit repetitive if I do want to keep coming back more often."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here and it was really good. I had the Butler's Steak with Salad. Super tasty. Small cozy place. The service was fine. The interior design fitted well with the hotel look. I would go back. I don't suggest this place if you have small children."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a bar filled with English speakers this seems to be the place.  Good drinks, cocktails and food.  Delicious scotch egg and green salad. Maybe a bit too pretentious for my taste."}
{"text":"Bar George was by far the prettiest bar I've ever seen. We were in Montreal for a few days and randomly stumbled upon Bar George. When we realized it was British food we decided to stay for lunch and try out the menu. I had the chicken pot pie (it was legit) and my friend ordered the Cornish hen (soooo tasty). I don't think I've ever gasped when waiters deliver my food but I did when I saw the size of my pie. Needlessly to say it was a good surprise. The service and ambiance was excellent. If you ever get the chance to visit definitely sit at the bar and try going during the day so you can see the gorgeous light that fills the room. 10/10 experience."}
{"text":"Bar George is such a beautiful place. The servers and staff are welcome, warm and friendly and the ambiance is great. It's such a special place in downtown Montreal. I've been with friends for brunch several times and it's always delicious. However, this time we noticed that the portions have been significantly reduced. Each of dishes was delicious but smaller and some didn't come with the sides of potatoes or greens like it used to. We decided to order an extra pain perdu to share. I still love this place but I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and a very nice bar. The burger was over cooked and under seasoned. Definitely will come back for cocktails, will probably skip the food!"}
{"text":"Lovely bar with good classic drinks and relaxed vibe. Hung out with smoker friends so we periodically stepped out for a cigarette (for them, not me) and the bartender was always great about keeping our bar spot and covering our drinks with a coaster. From my perspective, a nice touch of service.  Saw folks ordering food that smelled good as well."}
{"text":"Delicious. Amazing building, architecture, and interior decoration!!! We went for brunch on a recommendation from a friend and are so glad we did.  Don't miss this, even if it's just to stop in for a drink."}
{"text":"J'ai bcp aimé l'ambiance patrimoniale , les lumieres tamisées, le service , par contre la musique un peu forte. Nice drinks."}
{"text":"We went on Canada Day. We received excellent service and wonderful food. This place is certainly one that Canada can be proud of!   Our waiter recommended the smoked haddock hash with poached eggs; I'm glad I listened to him."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast while on vacation. Amazing vibe, beautiful architecture and decor. Unlike any other place, they take the basic concept of a breakfast and give it a surprising and delicious twist. The waiters are quick, very knowledgeable and fun. They break down the menu, explain everything very well and you can order your breakfast every which way you like. Their blood sausage and the poached eggs over avocado salad are a must try. Even the basics like sunny side and bacon was yummy, maybe it's the entire package that made it an experience rather than just eating food."}
