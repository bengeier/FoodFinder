{"text":"Nanalyn Jerk, is my go too place, when in need of a nice warm and comforting Jamaican food. With the various of selections their menu offers, I cannot resist the Ackee and Saltfish with the dumpling, boiled plantain and yam or the delicious well made rice and peas alongside their fantastic coleslaw.  Hands down the ackee and saltfish is amazing but let's not forget their other options, such as their Jerk chicken, filled with tons of flavours. Portion wise they do give a lot of food. Only downfall is their pricing, but for the taste the price is amazing. To sum it up Nanalyn Jerk is a great place, would recommend it to everyone, especially with their well mannered employees."}
{"text":"This place is very convenient if you're in a hurry, it's near downsview and Mackenzie ci. The chicken is great, very tender and nicely spiced. Coleslaw is to die for. 4.99 meal deal is worth every penny and students get a free juice. Interesting drinks"}
{"text":"We came here for a quick bite after visiting the new TTC subway stations for Doors Open TO. We had the jerk chicken and the jerk pork. Both were delicious and satisfied our craving for spicy jerk - the guy behind the counter was quiet but super nice and let us take the squirt bottle of pepper sauce to our table so we could make it as spicy as we wanted. The place itself is clean and simply decorated, a little dark but thats okay."}
{"text":"Very good oxtail, very good jerk chicken and pork everything is good everybody come  and try...you wouldn't be disappointed. ."}
{"text":"Fresh food, good portion at good price, the goat curry i ordered was actually mostly meat :) and not just bones like some places..  On top of that there is friendly staff and it is an immaculately clean restaurant. Even the washrooms were super clean. Will definitely return to try other items."}
{"text":"I went here because I saw a sign outside the restaurant that advertised a $4.99 lunch special. Lord have mercy, let me tell you how disappointed I was. 

1) The pictures that were taken of this place and posted on Yelp are cleaner than it actually is. It wasn't filthy but not very clean.
2) It has a sleezy vibe. Their clientele seem to only be there to drink beer and hang out. I felt really uncomfortable walking in. 
3) The lunch portion sizes are a total joke. I was served 2 of the smallest chicken legs I've ever seen, with 1 small scoop of rice. I guess you get what you pay for at this restaurant. 
3) The chicken didn't taste like authentic Jamaican jerk. It tasted like the chef went to No Frills and bought Mr. Goudas jerk bbq sauce. 
4) I also asked for a beef patty with Coco bread. He just put a beef patty in a bag with an uncut bun. I found that to be really lazy. Most people order it to eat right away, we shouldn't have to pry the bread open with our fingers while we are on the go. 

Overall I'm not happy and will never return! I'm upset that I spent my money here."}
{"text":"Tried both the jerk chicken and curry goat. The jerk chicken was a bit bland and the meat was a bit tough to eat. The goat was better, where the meat fell off the bones and the curry flavour was cooked into the meat. The coleslaw and rice that came with the meats were okay. The price is slightly above average than the standard Jamaican restaurant. I might come back for their goat, but definitely not the jerk chicken."}
{"text":"$4.99 Jerk Chicken special was worth the price.

The jerk was seasoned well and it was not bbq'd..which I am usually used to. However the oven taste was very well as the chicken was tender. I have been passing by this establishment frequently; seems like a family run business; and have been dying to try it.

I did enjoy the meal however next time I will try out their curry items; as they looked delicious!"}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant a 4 star rating. The staff was really nice and the atmosphere was just OK. (Very dark inside) The ox tail on the other hand was delicious! Very succulent and tender with lots of flavor. The coleslaw was  surprisingly good too. In the US we don't usually have a cole slaw with our ox tail.  The rice and beans were good and I sampled some of my wife's curry goat and chicken. Both were good. I would come back."}
{"text":"Food was good will be back when in the area. 

Delighted to have a nice spot north of eglinton and east of dufferin. 

Check it out if in the area. 

Tip: Call ahead if looking for steam snapper."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken was very tender and seasoned well. It was not overpowering and sometimes it can be salty...this was very good food. 

The large portion is chicken and rice for $10 and worth the price. 

The patties are $2 each which is steep, since they are the same size if not smaller."}
{"text":"Oxtail - superb.  Fall of the bone.  Mmmmmm.

Chicken curry roti - delish - spouse ate the entire thing.

My only thing is that I am more into the dal puri roti - which is found at Guyanese restaurants.  I never enjoy plain roti.  Having said that, the food here is good and I am picky.  Even the coleslaw was fresh and crunchy.

Nanalyn's food is tasty and the young man behind the counter is very courteous.

One of the stars of the show here is the peas and rice - or, rice and peas ... luscious ... melt in your mouth.  No shortage of calories here, Friends ... mmmm ... mmm ..."}
{"text":"Stopped by on my home. Had the jerk chicken, portions were great. Also had the plaintains and patty. Thought it was pretty good, first time trying jerk. Overall had a good first experience, and thought the pricing was very reasonable. Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"If you want an authentic Jamaican mama jerk chicken, Nanalyn Jerk is the place! First of all, it's nothing like Mr. Jerk or Caribbean island foods, jerk chicken is so tender and the flavours are not over powering the taste of the actual chicken.  It's like a true home made mothers meal. The chicken isn't the only star in the meal, the rice and coleslaw provides the same amount of attention. 
The chicken roti was also not heavy and greasy, but I find the wrapped bread I tasteless. Very homey taste though. 
I live just around the corner and very glad to find this hidden gem in a walking distance."}
{"text":"I pass by this restaurant frequently and have always wanted to give it a try. I'm a big fan of Jamaican food especially jerk chicken! So, the restaurant itself was clean and had a nice interior with simple decor. 

It was $7 for small and $10 for large. Of course I went big. Came with 2 drumsticks and a thigh, abundance of rice&beans and some coleslaw. The gravy on the chicken was nice and spicy! But it was missing something... it didn't have that smoked barrel taste to it. I think it was baked perhaps? 

Don't get me wrong, it tasted just fine and I ate the whole damn thing but it wasn't the same authentic jerk taste like back in Jamaica . I suppose nothing will ever be more legit than Jamaica. However, I read some good reviews on the oxtail and will give it a try next time!"}
