{"text":"Best sandwiches ever! And the cheesecake, well, I admit I have gone there for lunch and ate only a slice of cheesecake and it was heaven.  Very fresh ingredients and if you can walk by the front counter with all the cakes and goodies, you have amazing will power!"}
{"text":"I can never find anywhere to sit at this place - and getting a parking spot takes a bit of luck, too! Outlets are few & far between which makes the Lazy Loaf a no-go for studying (for me, anyway.) Service is (with very few exceptions) just brutal - I worked in coffee shops for years and years, and I know the vibe that most of these employees are giving off - burnt out, tired of repetition, and not given enough incentive or praise to care. There doesn't seem to be much in place in regards to an efficient system of operation... drink orders are scribbled down on a scrap piece of paper, and I'll never forget the time I ordered a latte and sat waiting for 15 minutes while nobody touched the espresso machine. It was sooooo awkward, although they were very apologetic once they realized they had immediately forgotten.

Beyond that, the food is AMAZING! Delicious soups & sandwiches, and one of the best baked goods displays I've seen (the chocolate explosion cake is my absolute nemesis, but I have also been seduced by the nanaimo bars more than once as well as  the carrot cake loaf... sigh).

Also, lots of children every time I've gone in.  Lots and lots of children."}
{"text":"A really nice local coffee shop/breakfast/lunch place.  They have delicious baked goods, giant toast/french toast and is a great place to while away a few hours with friends or to grab a coffee and muffin on the go."}
{"text":"I love stopping by on a weekend afternoon for a sandwich, which never disappoints! Always have to get a slice of carrot cake, and a loaf of bread before we leave!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from burnaby bc.went here for lunch and had the broccoli cheese soup ......it was amazing as was the bread my sandwich was made with. I highly recommend this little place .excellent food and prices were reasonable"}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this busy place and it was very healthy eating which we both love!  Busy yes a bit noisy yes. . Service is more help yourself. .but if you're looking for healthy homemade food vegetarian i think. . Its a great place to try and just off memorial drive coming out of Bowness towards Licks Ice cream right on memorial. .this rest is on a side dead end street.  There is also a really cute antique store kind of Olde English across the street for after lunch treat to browse!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! I wish they were bigger!

The Lazy Loaf is my most favorite place to go and have a tea and a snack with a friend.

They make yummy sandwiches to order, you just have to highlight what you want on the little pieces of paper they have by the register.  They have MANY amazing sweet treats.  They change them up all the time and its like i'm a kid in a candy store everytime I go!

The last time i was there my cousin mentioned it was my birthday and the sweetheart behind the cash gave me the fruit flan I ordered for free! Awwww so nice! He also said \"now your legal hey?\" Which made me happy because i'm WAY past legal!  He made my day thats for sure!

I would recommend this place to anyone.  If you want to go later on in the evening you will find that it quiets down.  It has a great atmosphere and the booths are good for squishing all your friends into and having a laugh!"}
{"text":"The best homemade soups and sandwiches i could find in the city!! I love this quaint little home in the wall!!"}
{"text":"Great espresso finally; thankfully they got rid of Phil & Sebastien coffee. Awesome and fresh sandwiches as well. Friendly staff always. Check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I try to make it out to this place as often as I can as they have some of the best soups and sandwiches in town. I try to avoid the weekends and the lunch hour as it gets very busy. Parking is a bit tricky at times as spots are limited.

Everything is very fresh and it's nice to have a place to sit down and chat in a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch probably one of the worst places I've been to. The food was cold and nasty the coffee was cold and bland the service was terrible. I complained about my food and nothing was said or done I would never recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"LOOOOVE THE LAZY LOAF!! Ive been here a couple times now, once for dessert and coffee and once for lunch. They seem to always be open, so thats the first plus. They are a bit more expensive, but as soon as you walk in you see their menu items are worth the price. Ive never seen such big portions. The pastries are twice the size of a regular bakery/cafe's. The sandwiches are made on amazing fresh bread, and the salads are always fresh, and are given in generous portions too. Its cozy, and they have a little outdoor patio to hang out on, on nicer days."}
{"text":"We arrived and were attracted by the menu. However, we were instantly scared off by the staff's really rude attitude. The girl at the counter was seemingly annoyed by the most simple questions about their breakfast menu. We decided to stay, though, and the breakfast was decent but nothing special. More than $30 for a very simple breakfast for two (nothing is included in their breakfast offers) is way overprized."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place, simply because they offer super quality home-baked goods and are independently owned.

This place isn't fancy and the service is almost cafeteria-style. If you want a sandwich, you fill out a little chit and highlight what you'd like on it. Then, they give you a table number and deliver your lunch to your table. The service is quick and the quality of the food is always consistently solid. Their fresh-baked breads and other baked goods are what keep you coming back.

The menu could use a bit of a face-lift, but overall this place is a great little coffee house and bakery. I often buy a loaf of bread to take home as I am on my way out the door.

The worst thing about this place is the parking. It's a tiny little lot and many of the spots are 1-hour only."}
{"text":"A cozy restaurant with lots of breakfast, sandwich, and caffeine options to choose from! We came here for a late breakfast on a Sunday and were delighted by the brunch options that are served longer on the weekends. The portions were large and hit the spot in terms of breakfast food. The highlight was the homemade bread that came with the meals - fresh and delicious!

There is lots of seating inside as well as outside for a comfortable experience. Although we didn't try the desserts, they looked delicious!

We stopped by a couple of days later and the staff were helpful in suggesting beverages. We went with sweetened iced green peach tea, which was perfect. 

Would recommend stopping by for a coffee, brunch, or light lunch."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places. One time I saw Mark Giordano there, and he shook my hand, sooooooooo it's pretty cool. Also, the \"Eat More\" bars are to die for."}
{"text":"Totally yummy, but how can sandwiches be so expensive?

I find myself here periodically because it's one of the few places in the NW that have real character, but it comes at a price. $10 sandwiches? I understand that they're made fresh with great ingredients on yummy bread and all that, but really?

Still, this is probably the most wholesome place within a 5km radius.

Go for the chocolate cannoli if they have it. Limit yourself to a half-sandwich so that you have room left. Avoid the chicken lasagna special, which is really just chicken breast and pasta under mounds of oil and cheese.

And don't get into an accident in the crazy pseudo-parking lot on the street!"}
{"text":"After reading many positive reviews I was really disappointed by my first experience.  For starters I found the coffee to be nearly undrinkable which I think is a big sin in any place that serves breakfast.  My poached eggs were yellow and greasy looking from whatever oil product they used to line the cooking tins; I order poached eggs to avoid that.  The breakfast potatoes were okay, nothing to write home about but nothing to complain about either.  The bread for the 9 grain toast was really nice but, unfortunately, they went a bit overboard with the butter or margarine that they put on. I guess that's on me for not specifying.  So, overall, not terrible but definitely wouldn't recommend it to a friend based on my one experience."}
{"text":"We visit this place with frequency on Saturdays during late summer/early fall during football season. It's the only place around Shouldice with decent coffee (that I know of). Also, their cinnamon twists are to die for."}
{"text":"All of the food at the Lazy Loaf is absolutely amazing. Sadly, their customer service is terrible. I'm usually willing to wait in long lines and tip busy staff at a place that has delicious food. To me, it's worth it. Too bad they don't put just a smidge more effort into their staff. My typical experience is that the staff is overly cool to customers - basically, their only goal is to put your food in front of you. Every single time I've gotten my order to go, it's been wrong. The latest time a friend and I each ordered a roast beef sandwich, only to get back to work to realize there was no meat on our sandwiches. When I called to complain, the general feeling I got over the phone was that they couldn't believe I was calling to complain about it. Not even an apology. I always say \"please\" and \"thank-you\" and tell the staff to have a nice day. I've never received a \"thanks\" or \"you to\" in response... usually only a dead-pan expression from staff as they walk away. I've worked in restaurants, I know what it's like, but I also know that part of the experience for customers is the servers and staff. It's also how you make tips and keep customers. I have been willing to overlook the attitude of the staff because the food seriously is that good, but after the last time I visited, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The BF and I went here for the first time ever last week and there was plenty of parking and seating. The staff was super friendly and we loved our meal. I honestly cannot remember what we ordered but I think we split the BLT. We were debating what kind of bread to put the sandwich on and ended up with the Kettle bread which was amazing!

You can customize your sandwiches too which is pretty awesome. You order at the counter and then sit wherever you want. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to arrive which was nice. The vibe was relaxed, cozy, and not too loud (it could also have been because it a Tuesday a little after typical lunch time).

I would definitely come back here again for lunch the next time I'm in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Dry tuna sandwich, as if they just dumped a can of tuna on the bread and charged $9 for it. 
The pickles were good..."}
{"text":"A great example of how an atmosphere like your Mom's kitchen and good bread, can overcome mediocrity, high pricing and poor service. The staff appears to hustle, there just doesn't ever seem to be enough of them visible.  

A consistently watered down large coffee at over $3.00 is excessive. Bottled water at $4.00 is ridiculous. The list goes on including soup; a mediocre Caesar salad. I  have come at early evening, pleasantly quiet if you need to work, but the coffee is almost cold ( tried and tested 4 times) and the service is even worse than during daytime. There are no line-ups but you have to follow someone around to get them to take your money. So the ironic coffee upside is, just get your coffee, sit and enjoy it. You have 3 choices depending on your conscience: 1)  Pay them when the line-up goes down, 2) pay them when you can find someone to take your money, or 3) don't pay them at all. You tried, you failed, let it go."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place.So I wanted to give it a try for myself and my wife. Ordered some breakfast when we received it, it was cold there bread tasted very stale and drythe coffee was lukewarm.  Not sure why my buddy recommend this place but I will never eat here again.  and the girl was snotty when I gave my opinion of the breakfast."}
{"text":"I have only ever heard raves about The Lazy Loaf & Kettle, I was excited when I finally got a chance to try it!  It is only accessible right off 3 Ave (which turns into Bowness and Parkdale), because it is in a culdesac, so you have to really watch for the turn.

The parking around the culdesac was packed, but I was able to snag a spot.  When I walked in the place was jammed with people.  There was a group of people standing at the end of the line, they seemed like they were waiting, so I asked and they were.  It seems quite a few people get their lunch to go.  I can see why since the tables were all full.  There is a little form you fill out for your sandwich order, what meat you want, cheese, veggies, if you want soup or salad.  Of the variety of options for sandwiches I choose turkey, with swiss and pretty much all the veggies.  I decided to get the \"lazy loafers special\" which was half a sandwich, half soup and half salad.  They had 2 soup options, I choose tomato and basil.  While I was waiting in line I could not resist looking at all the supper yummy baked goods and desserts, so I also decided to get a peach raspberry strudel.  The staff taking orders is very efficient, the woman who took mine was very nice and gave me props for figuring things out on my first time.  I also got the green tea latte.  I got my strudel and latte right away, along with a number for my meal.  The prices are up there for things, my lunch combo cost $11.25, my latte $4.50 and strudel $3.50, so it was almost $20 for my order!  Sandwiches alone were $7, with soup or salad $12.  The breakfast was all around $7-9.

I was able to get a table after a little wait.  I ate my strudel as I waited, which was one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth!  The fruit was spilling out of it, the crust was sweet and tender. My latte was super hot, but tasted just right.  I waited about 15 minutes for my lunch, again the staff seem really efficient for how busy this place is!   My sandwich was only half, but it was packed with stuff!  It was so good.  The fruit salad I got was a bit sad, I wouldn't get that again.  The soup was fresh and very good!  

I loved the Lazy Loaf & Kettle!  It was busy, but that's a good sign!  I would definitely return here, maybe for breakie next time!"}
{"text":"Good food but terrible service. You will wait a long time and often your order will get screwed up. They seem to be chronically understaffed. It doesn't seem like the staff's fault, as they are always rushing around trying to do their best, but just not enough staff to handle the customer volume. C'mon manager/owner...this place is always busy but you are going to start losing customers because of the slow service. I know I certainly won't be popping by unless I have at least an hour to wait."}
{"text":"I have been coming here once a week in the evenings for about five years. The baked goods are some of the best in town. The sandwiches are the best in town. The coffee is of high quality."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fresh homemade comfort food this is the place to go to.  The only downside is that there will be plenty of other people wanting to do the same.  Parking and seating will be limited as this place is very popular.

Ordering can be a little tricky for newcomers as you must wait in line for a cashier who will take your order (if getting a sandwich they have forms you can fill out to customize your order).  You'll be given a numbered wooden spoon on a pedestal to take to your table and your order will be brought to you when it's done. Desserts are tasty but huge (like 4 inch cubes of puffed wheat squares!) so feel free to share them.

My wife and I will go every couple of weeks and buy a few loaves of bread after our meal to take home (the kettle bread and raisin bread are our favorites)  We try to freeze them for making toast occasionally but they're usually eaten up too quickly."}
{"text":"Great little spot! Coffee and food was delicious, and the staff was so friendly. No dogs allowed on the patio, but they can be just on the other side of the railing, which is fine."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and deserts. We take these to events as a treat for the host. Always a big hit."}
{"text":"This is a cozy and casual place that serves up a good selection of breakfast staples, and comfort food for lunch (not sure about dinner). The atmosphere is very casual, order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table once ready. There is a pretty large seating area and ample parking outfront.The staff are quick but not overly friendly, and the prices are a bit high in my opinion. All in all a good stop for breakfast and they do plenty of catering too."}
{"text":"Solid place for breakfast, lunch, coffee or a baked goods craving! Great spot for a post run brunch or breakfast on the weekends."}
{"text":"busy place!  Everyone seems to like it

french toast 2.5/5"}
{"text":"This is a good little spot with delicious baked goods but it is VERY popular. I came here at lunch one day to do some work. I was expecting a quiet-to-moderately-noisy coffee shop (as they coffeeshops usually are) but it was complete chaos. The venue was packed with customers and the lineup was practically out the door. I placed my order and sat down, expecting the rush to calm down once the afternoon got underway... it didn't. My food and coffee were delicious but I found my surroundings overcrowded. The space itself is a little dated in the decor and everything is crammed together so it's not easy to walk around. I liked what I had, but I feel if I were ever to come by here again it would just be to pick something up to go -- I definitely don't want to linger."}
{"text":"We stopped in for Sunday lunch and it was if course crazy busy. I explained to my family how the ordering works, and we sat and made our sandwich orders on the provides papers. 

When we went to order we did that thing most families do, where both my mom and I slapped down our credit cards to pay for lunch. My mom quickly conceded and took her card back. The reaction of the staff however was..weird, if not just plain rude. The girls at the till looked at each other, rolled their eyes, shook their heads. One girl stepped back and threw her arms up in the air like this 1 minute decision on who was paying had somehow completely inconvenienced her. They also expressed their annoyance In figuring out if the meals were all together (4) or separate (into 2 orders). The whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth for our Lunch date there. 

We ended up getting our meal decently fast, and then both the sandwich orders were wrong. I ordered salmon salad and got tuna. I ordered Swiss cheese and got cheddar. I ordered no tomato and no sprouts and got tomato and sprouts. The sandwich was alright - not what I ordered and definitely not mind blowing but, it tasted good enough. I could tell my whole family was underwhelmed and not thrilled on the experience. Bummer. 

I watched as several other customers got serious attitude, and then decided I probably wouldn't come back, which is unfortunate because I loved this place when I lived in Calgary"}
{"text":"Time for an update, I'll make it short and sweet.

The Lazy Loaf & Kettle has THE best chocolate croissants I have EVER ingested in my entire life. To be completely accurate, it's a chocolatey explosion at every bite. 

And don't even GET me started on their cinnamon twists. Um, can you say tongue orgasm?!?!? Fer real.

LL&K's croissants and cinnamon twists are SO good I could go there every single weekend for the rest of my life and STILL want more. *THAT GOOD*

 I'd use more descriptive words, but let's just face it, this kind of tongue heaven, you just have to experience for yourself.

Just a word a caution Yelpers: the two baked goods mentioned above sell like hot cakes. You HAVE to get there early if you want a piece of heaven. You know what they say: 'Early bird catches the worm'...and in this case, you'd best be flying like a falcon."}
{"text":"I love the Lazy Loaf and Kettle. I used to live in the area, so I'd try to go in as much as possible, but sometimes it is hard to get a seat because it is always full of people (at least when I go).

I love that I get to pick my toppings on a grocery list of ingredients to make my perfect sandwich. The bread is soft and tasty, which is definitely a selling point for me. They don't give you too much though, perfect bread to topping ratio.

Now on to my favorite part - the coffee. I have no words to describe their coffee other than delicious. Or maybe perfect. Or smooth. I change my mind, there are lots of words to describe it. I currently live quite a ways away from the Lazy Loaf now, but I would drive there just for some of their coffee, that's how much I like it."}
{"text":"Very over rated. 

$30 for two sandwiches  $30.

Then when you pay with debit....they ask you what percentage or $ amount for a tip? Why tip when it's counter service? ? That's like tipping at subway.....doesn't make sense.


Surprised people keep coming back but I guess it's the only cafe in the area so we have to put up with the inflated prices and daft staff."}
{"text":"The battle is over as quality definitely takes the upper hand to quantity on this one. As previous reviews mention it is difficult to find but when driving on Bowness Rd the side of the building does have a huge painted on sign. I wish they would take it down though as this place is just too good to make overly popular. It's like when you find that great band on itunes suggestions and secretly pray they never make it famous so you can stand in the front row during their small concert tours.
Dim lighting and mismatched chairs give this place character. The smell of fresh bread, cookies the size of your head, and a \"small town cafe,\" feel are why this place hits home for me.
Overly friendly staff  and special recipes for your most basic bkst/lunch foods are what this place has going for it. 
And yeah, things are priced a little on the high side, but I'll pay it if I don't have to watch people order through a window drive thru at the side of my lunch table.

I found this place using my yelp app on my crackberry whilst at work. Check it out."}
{"text":"Nice place little cafe to grab a quick coffee and pastry or bfast/lunch. They have a small parking lot in front but it can fill up quick fast so you might have to park on the street nearby. I totally recommend the butter croissant, it was nicely golden brown, super crunchy on top and the inside was super soft. My husband got the omlete where you can pick a choice of 4 ingredients and it came with hash browns and toast. I had a bite and it and thought it was tasty as well. I decided to get the French toast and choose it with raisin bread. The bread was thick and fluffy. The matcha latte was not that great and would not get it again."}
{"text":"You can place a to go order but they make you wait in line with everyone else. Not recommended if you're on a lunch break."}
{"text":"This place is within a 10 minute walk of my house and I love dropping in for lunch (I love that I can pick what goes on my sandwich and I find the kettle bread always delicious and fresh) or a weekend brunch. I'm also addicted to their raspberry crumble bars and often pick those up on the weekends. 

It tends to be busier on the weekends but it's worth the wait. If I go in on weekday evenings or weekend afternoons it's not as busy and pretty easy to grab a table. I always find the staff very friendly."}
{"text":"This little neighbourhood gem serves up delicious hot and cold beverages and homemade cooking that's as close to comfort as you can get! Although the lines are long, It goes quickly as the service is quick and efficient with two tills. 

We tried the Ruben sandwiches with soup and salads on our first visit and will be back next week again for dessert and coffees. We loved the cozy busyness with messy art vibrancy on the walls."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5
Atmosphere: 3/5
Service: 3/5
Overall experience: 3/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

If you're looking for a place for great soups and sandwiches, this is definitely the place to go! I haven't heard of this place before until one of my friends took me here. The decor is a little confusing with mismatched things here and there, but you get a sense of wholesomeness as you sit down to eat or sip coffee.

When Lazy Loaf & Kettle isn't catering, they serve a variety of breakfast items (french toast, pancakes, omelets, granola), sandwiches, soup, salads and deliciously tempting baked goods. Sandwiches start at around $7 and if you get a combo with a soup it will be around $11. A pretty PRICEY meal but definitely filling and fresh.

Once you walk in, you can grab an order form for a sandwich with your choice of condiments, cheese, deli (ham, Montreal smoked meat, roast beef, turkey, tuna/wild salmon salad, vegetarian, egg salad), and veggies.

I decided to try their special which happened to be a Turkey Melt (turkey, cheese, lettuce, mayo, tomato) on freshly baked cranberry bread with tomato dill soup. After ordering, you will be given a number and once it's ready servers bring it to your table. The sandwich was delicious! The bread was nicely toasted and the flavors melded perfectly together. The soup on the other hand didn't have enough dill and the texture was more like a marinara sauce which was off-putting.

Overall, I love how fresh the sandwiches and soups are and the specials keeps things interesting. I just find that the sandwiches are too pricey to make me a repeat customer (plus it's out of my way). However, I suggest at least a visit if you are in the area to try their specials. If you're at the University and have some time to kill it's also a great place to visit for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"What a great little place. Cute and cozy.

We ordered a sandwich and soup combo for about $12.

The food took some time, but only because the place was busy. The staff were friendly and patient as we took our time making our selections.

The french toast breakfast looked great, gonna have to get it next time."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite, and the cafe itself is very quaint. Lots of seating and booths available for those by themselves or groups alike. I ordered a half sandwich and a bottled water, and it came out to $11 (the bottled water was almost $4!!!). The grilled chicken on my sandwich was dry, which was disappointing. The service was very quick, and the restrooms are clean. I would like to try one of their coffee drinks or pastries the next time to see if my opinion is swayed. I feel like there are better cafes to visit at lunch."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best sandwiches in town - their bread is crazy good. Pleasant outdoor seating, friendly staff, plus all kinds of large, delicious baked goods (and coffee of course); what more could I possibly desire?"}
{"text":"Delicious wholesome comfort food at it's best.

 Before you place your order you grab an order form and a marker to select everything you want on your sandwich. Lazy Loaf has an extensive selection of meat, vegetable, cheese and condiment options to be placed on their amazing kettle bread so it is likely that you will end up with a sandwich far bigger than your mouth's ability to bite it. I wish I had the ability to unhinge my jaw so I could take a proper bite! 

They also have a nice variety of soups, and don't get me started on all of their cookies, cakes, pastries and breads. It is a nice warm and comfortable environment to have a coffee or a meal with friends, but it's popularity often  exceeds the amount of available tables."}
{"text":"This place used to be a calgary icon, but I find that their service is often grumpy, their sandwiches are meh and quite pricey. With all the awesome brunch options in Calgary now, I find Lazy Loaf to be just okay."}
{"text":"Hit after hit after hit - That's what every single experience I've had at Lazy loaf has been. I've been coming to Lazy Loaf every now and then for a little over 10 years and every single sandwich, every single soup and every single coffee I've had has been exactly what I wanted.

Most recently, my folks just got back to Canada after 6 months in Costa Rica and were craving some good, down-home North American Soup and Sandwiches. They wanted to be decently quick, they wanted soup, they wanted to sit down and it should be on the way to my house. Sounds tricky, right? Nope! Lazy Loaf and Kettle. 

They're a popular place, so get ready to share the space with a few people. You'll have to inch passed people at their tables and weave past others in line as you try find a seat. It's not the kind of coffee shop that I'd come to hunker down with my laptop at, take meetings or bring a date (almost. Read on.) With so many people, the energy is high and besides, you'd just be a jerk if you were taking up space with a lap top in this kind of crowd.

I mentioned dates! If you're going to take dating advice from me (and I suggest you don't) this is a great place to work into a date, instead of making it the sole destination. It's too busy and rushed feeling for a 1st date, but go for a walk along the river path and make this your stop for lunch. You're golden."}
{"text":"Wasn't overly impressed considering all the high reviews. Found the cafe to be quite dirty (really needs some dusting). Our sandwiches were okay but the bread was dry and didn't find them to be anything that exciting especially for the price. We didn't try any of the baking so can't comment on that."}
{"text":"Great food and nice employees as well. I have been here many times and have never been disappointed. Their breakfasts are great although the bacon is usually quite salty.
I recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"The Lazy Loaf is a great place to go for brunch or lunch. There is generally a line up, but the staff are very fast and it moves through quite quickly. The baked goods are fantastic and you get large portions for the price. The price is very reasonable, and I especially love that you can order a half a sandwich with soup instead of wasting a ton of food. The food is great - the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the food is quite simple and you aren't treated by servers as you pay before you receive the food."}
{"text":"The EATMORE bars are just pure salt.  AVOID.  The rest of the chunky deserts are all pretty much the same kind of recipe, and even all look the same. AVOID."}
{"text":"Even though the wait is longer than most cafes, it is worth it. Delicious sandwiches, outstanding pickles, phenomenal Oreo macaroons (I think they are my favourite dessert item I have ever had) and great speciality coffees and regular coffees. Great little find. Will be back and will bring friends along with me."}
{"text":"Parking lot seemed like a bit of a gong show; parked at another parking lot a little bit over but even that one was weird. Came at around 11, a little bit before the lunch rush so might explain the busy parking lot. 

My friend tried the roast beef sandwich and I had the mac n cheese. We shared a gigantic cream cheese cookie sandwich (that we did not finish). 

They have a piece of paper where you can highlight what you would like on the sandwich. Old school but efficient way to get the orders right. 

I had a bite of the sandwich. It was good and I love that it is freshly made but a sandwich is a sandwich and that is all I can say. 

The mac n cheese was a pretty big portion and came with a choice of your side. The mac n cheese was topped with loads of cheese, but underneath it I found the sauce was a little less cheesy and a bit more.. Ranchy? The tasted reminded me a lot of ranch sauce. I don't know if that's good or bad. I opted for the spinach salad as my side which came with a delicious berry dressing. Not your average dinky sad side salad. 

The cookie was huuuge! Size-of-my-face huge. Loaded with tons of cream cheese in the middle, it works well with the ginger snap cookie. 

You take a number and they bring out the food when it's ready. Water is self serve and you also seat yourself. The place is definitely not small, but was packed the entire time we were there. 

Definitely a cute little place to grab lunch with friends and chat and hang out a little, although I would hate to see people hanging out even after their food was done because the place is sooo busy. If you're in the area and want to grab a laid back casual lunch, definitely a good place!"}
{"text":"The good: seating is available so you're not stuck waiting an hour for a table. Big menu with lots of options and half portions. Helpful and nice staff. 

Bad: The ordering process. It really lowers the overall dining experience when I feel like I'm in the lineup at Tim hortons. The lighting is bad, there is noise from the kitchen, the tables are WAY too close to each other and not cleaned often enough. The coffee was mediocre at best and was self serve, but still cost $3 for 16oz. They have other drinks that I didn't try. 

My experience:
The breakfast menu was decent but very plain, except for the special which was cinnamon French toast. I had that, without the sides and waited for my food. After receiving it I realized I hadn't received any syrup and with no hope of flagging anyone down, I just asked the table next to me for some. The French toast was 4 huge slices. They tasted ok but the cinnamon spread that came with them really added a lot of flavor. The French toast didn't seem to be permeated with egg and the middle of the thick slices just tasted like normal bread."}
{"text":"Ordered a a personalized greeting birthday cake for $40.00 and when I went to pick it up the top of the cake was squashed obliterating the \"Happy Birthday\" message.  I expressed my disappointment however the staff couldn't care less about the damage they caused. They were uncaring and uninterested in fixing the problem or offering a damage discount. Should change their name to Lazy Staff and Kettle of I Couldn't Care Less. Needless to say I won't be spending another dollar there."}
{"text":"I love lazy loaf but due to it's popularity it's often a long wait and difficult to find a table and it a total skip when you're starving around a typical meal time. 

When you do decide to wait,  the food is fresh and delicious.  They put carrots in their bread for the sandwiches which makes it very moist and has a unique kick to it.   An insider tip - if you order the vegetarian you get two kinds of cheese (it won't tell you this on the order slip)

My preference here is sandwiches and baked goods.   I dislike the breakfast - it's a bit too greasy and way too expensive.    The prices are all a bit high but I don't mind paying it for most of the offerings aside from breakfast.  

Overall it's very good tasting delicious food that's fresh and reasonably healthy.  Worth the wait if you can afford the time."}
{"text":"When the question \"what's in a name?\" comes up, I usually gloss over it without much thought. After visiting \"the Lazy Loaf and Kettle\", I have a newfound appreciation for this question. What's in a name? Well...a Lot.
I can't think of a better way to sum up this comfy, down home Canadian diner with more tea options than you can shake a stick at. 
The bread is freshly made and is, for lack of a better word, UH-MAZING.  The LBs would add up quickly if I lived anywhere near this place, which makes it awesome that I found it while vacationing far, far away (but also saddening that I live far, far away). 
The sammies are nothing new in it's composition, but quite tasty just the same. Also, the veggies used in the our sammies were crisp and fresh...a huge pet peeve of mine when it is anything but.
The service is friendly and fun and lends to a welcoming ambience that is obviously enjoyed by both out of towners and locals alike."}
{"text":"This place is great! Our work orders catering from here often. Sandwiches are fresh and flavorful. Pickles and squares are good as well. Have never been to the store, so this review is based on catering only."}
{"text":"Great hang over food. homemade soups fresh bread genius idea by ticking off what you want on a little paper for ordering save money on wait staff. it was busy and cute. I would open a place like this great concept"}
{"text":"Super delish! The tuna melt is to die for. My son loved his sandwich and loaded it with everything he could. We left here very full. Large servings but should be as it is also kinda pricy. You could share and still get plenty to eat."}
{"text":"This place has good food & nice coffee & lots of options. I only give them 3 stars because the place is to small for there needs, When your spending that much money on food (almost always over $5 for a single pastry) and one of the girls working there is always rude."}
{"text":"Great sandwich place. You can custom build your sandwiches. The bread is very tasty and I like the avocado option. The desserts are very delicious. The lemon and shortbread bars are my favourites. Also had a vanilla latte; I have had better. It was average.  They also have a chalk board above the kitchen which I don't see. It had some nice salads advertised. Wish I would have ordered one."}
{"text":"I live in the deep southeast, so the Lazy Loaf and Kettle is a long way from home. In order to go, I really really have to go out of my way. None of our family lives near it. I can scarcely remember where it's located. Despite all of these things, it has made this deep impression on me and whenever we're looking for a lunch haunt, I offer it as one of my favourites.

The Lazy Loaf and Kettle is a wonderful sandwich place. They make their own bread, have awesome toppings, and embrace the small town coffee shop feel with a bevvy of pastries and desserts.

Most recently, my SO and I introduced two friends who plan to go to the Lazy Loaf and Kettle on a regular basis now. 

I really recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"I really understand a comment made in a previous review \"I wish the staff hated their customers a little less\". It's been a couple years since we've been but my daughter really wanted their pancakes. The pancakes were very good however they forgot to cook my son's pancake. When I approached one of the staff about it, there was no sorry just a \"it'll take a few minutes\" and walked away. We waited much longer than that (10 minutes at least) and it still hasn't arrived so my husband went to see what the hold up was. Instead of putting his pancake to the front of the cooking order, they fed it to the back. All of us had finished our sandwiches and Mac and cheese by the time his pancake came out with still nothing but a blank stare from the staff. We are very disappointed with the uncaring attitude of the staff. As far as food taste, the salad was good, the sandwich just ok, the Mac and cheese was good and the pancake was good. There are lots of good places to eat in Calgary and with such a terrible staff attitude, I'll be supporting other restaurants with good food and nice staff."}
{"text":"Good spot to grab a snack and coffee then cross the street to the river walkway.  Grab a bench, enjoy the view and people watch.  They have a really great variety from breakfast/brunch to lunch and desserts and oh yes they do catering as well.  I see they have added dinner options but I haven't tried that  yet.  The coffee is Phil & Sebastian's which is a nice choice without having to walk too far from my front door.  I have the choice of hiking it up the hill to Timmy's or a leisurely stroll along the river walk to the Lazy Loaf.  Guess that makes me a bit of a lazy loaf for avoiding the hill...but its better coffee!  The Carrot Cake is insane and keeps us coming back time and time again.      You can see the pieces of carrot and the cake is light and moist with a great cream cheese icing.  One piece is huge and easily shared although I have been tempted to be a glutton and eat the whole thing myself.  Great choices for fresh made sandwiches and they do a lunch soup an salad deal which is pretty good.  They have wifi and a decent sized seating area with good light which means folks are inclined to hang out for a while.  There is also a very sunny outdoor seating area but unfortunately it faces the parking lot which is not really pretty.   That would be the only downside to this lovely local cafe hence the  loss of a star.  Although a few more visits for carrot cake and I might be inclined to cough up star number five."}
{"text":"This place is a little out of the way for me. I don't know what it is about their sandwiches but they are my favourite sandwiches in the City. The combo of sprouts and the bread along with all other sandwich ingredient options just nails it on every level. The only thing that holds me back from giving 5 stars is the fact that it deserves a renovation and because it is always busy sometimes getting a seat can be a challenge, though it almost always works out.  Delish"}
{"text":"We dropped in on a weekday afternoon to get something quick to eat and coffees to drink; my first experience here was fantastic; the place was not that busy and we did not need to wait long in line to order; order was easy and the girl who was taking the order was super helpful, great attitude and very welcoming; they have soups, sandwiches, desserts, coffee, breads, etc. Lots of options to be honest to choose from; you can make your own sandwiches as you like and this gives lots of flexibility; we ordered sandwiches, both Chicken, and Americano, my favourite; the coffee was really good, sandwiches were super tasty and fresh; the atmosphere of the cafe is super good, you will feel you are at home, people sitting and playing games, drawing , etc. 
Not sure if they had WiFi as we got the sandwiches and coffee and left as we did not have time to stay;
I will definitely recommend this place, you will love this cozy Cafe."}
{"text":"I've tried their lunch special Eggs Benny variation several times now--baguette slices instead of English biscuits, and sausage+tomato instead of ham. The Hollandaise is lip-smacking good. It's on my short list of breakfast/brunch places in the NW."}
{"text":"Tasty ingredients, but when i highlight clearly the toppings on a sheet of paper and you mess that up, it's just bloody frustrating. Especially when i order to go."}
{"text":"Jesus, this place is always busy. First time I was in town with K, we were going to drop in for a bite but Lazy Loaf & Kettle was so packed, we decided to go elsewhere. Well, this time I came by myself to grab her some food while she studied (I know, I know, I'm such a good friend).

Weekends are busy busy. I dropped by early Saturday afternoon and there was a massive line for takeout. No worries though, it moves pretty fast.

The menu is pretty straightforward with hot and cold drinks, breakfast and lunch options. Sandwiches and soups seem to be their jam. They also have massive baked goodies that tempt you while you wait in line.

Couple specials on their side menu, just above the kitchen counter. Nothing too mind blowing/dramatic here.

You get to customize your sandwich to your hearts content. I like how they have special breads for every day of the week (Monday: Sundried tomato, Tuesday: Wheat and honey, Wednesday: Cranberry rosemary, Thursday: Cheese and chive, Friday: Dill, Saturday: Asiago Italian herb, and Sunday: Rosemary garlic). Makes them stand out from the crowd a bit.

Takeout bag. FYI - not the best bag to carry when you're biking back home. At least it lasted with only a few small tears.

Whole sandwich with soup ($14.10) and puffed wheat squares ($4.10) - got the Saturday Asiago Italian herb bread and tomato bacon soup special. Didn't try the sandwich and soup but my friend liked it. Good amount of turkey meat and vegetables. I had the puffed wheat square which was pretty addictive. Fell apart easily and not overly sweet.

Decent spot to grab brunch if sandwiches and soups is up your alley. Just be prepared to wait if you want to eat inside, otherwise take it to go/eat outside on the patio!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Tasty food; quality ingredients; homemade bread. Their sandwiches are delicious & their soup is amazing! Every time I've brought someone that has never been before they are always amazed at how good the food is. Definitely a \"go to\" place to eat when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"So I was craving a cookie, and of course I checked Yelp for a good spot to stop on the way home.  The LL&K came up so I thought I'd try it, as I love a good little neighborhood gem.
The place was buzzing with activity at lunch hour - always a good sign!
There was a short line up for take out and bakery items, which gave me just enough time to peruse the display case.
The cookies were literally the size of my face, and they had a few different flavors. Considering that's what I came in there to get, I should've had one.
But instead I got side tracked by the Date Square (I'm a DS snob and I'm always on the hunt for just the right one), and the enormous Eatmore slice.
The date square was pretty good - good enough to order again for sure.  Pretty good fruit/oat ratio, not overly spiced, and a nice large size.
The Eatmore bar was nothing like an Eatmore, so that was a little disappointing.  However, if they would've just called it a chocolatey krispie peanut crunch bar, then they would've nailed it, but I realize that name is a mouthful.
Because I haven't tried any of their lunch items and only two baked goods, I can't give a full 5 stars yet, but I do intend on going back soon to get a cookie (and probably at least one other baked good, because there's no way you can leave with just one sweet!)"}
{"text":"Awesome food, terrific desserts and a quaint cafe. I had the curry yam soup and a Montreal smoked meat sandwich. Got to pick my own cheese, toppings and even the meat. Fabulous!"}
{"text":"Loved this place the moment we walked in.  I'd heard about it before and decided to take my lil girl out for a coffee date.  So we set the GPS and off we went on a new adventure.  It was pretty easy to find even though it wasn't visible immediately.  

It was afternoon and there was a small line up but it went pretty quick.  Most were ordering coffee or baked goodies.  I liked their sandwich deal...grab an order form, select the items you want on your sammy and hand them your order.   Next time we will grab some sammy's and head down to the path by the river for a picnic.

In the meantime I had my usual, lil girl had her usual (hot chocolate with whip), she got a valentine's day cookie and I had a chocolate croissant (my weakness).  Being the good wifey that I am I picked up a massive puffed wheat square for hubs and additional cookie for the boy.  Lil girl and I sat down, enjoyed our treats & hot bevy's and talked about girl stuff.

It's an eclectic little place that was non stop busy.  They also sell fresh made bread.  Looking forward to visiting again for some more yummy goodness.  Oh and the coffee was tasty too."}
{"text":"Ahh Lazy Loaf, you're always so good to me! Whenever I'm in the mood for a low key coffee or lunch I seem to find myself here. The sandwiches are HUGE, fresh, and delicious. I like how you can make it your own, with whatever toppings you like. Besides my usual soup & half sandwich, I always end up buying one of the desserts as well (the eclairs are TO DIE) because they are just SO tasty. It's usually super busy so it can be frustrating when you cant find a table. Also, I find it a little pricey. But the sandwiches really do fill you up, so you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Whenever I see a BLT on the menu of a restaurant I order it, and I've got to say the lazy loaf has the best BLT in the citayyy (in my opinion of course). It is a mouthful! The bread they use is tasty and fresh, the bacon is always cooked superbly, with plenty of tomatoes and crispy lettuce. I also am also addicted to their carrot cake... huge slices with moist cake and rich icing. 

I'm a huge sucker for sweets and baked goods. Ive ordered their \"millionaire shortbread\" and \"homemade Oreos\" both at different times and both were super grainy and unpleasant, so that was disappointing. I would rate them 3.5 if I could but feel 3 is too low. 

I prefer to come here during the afternoon (around 2) on weekdays because at noon and dinner time this little cafe is buzzing with people and it's hard to find a seat. You can always take to go as well and have a picnic at the river if you cant find a spot inside."}
{"text":"Oh I'm so glad I found this breakfast place! I love breakfast so naturally I couldn't turn down more breakfast! The decor is adorable, so many old kettles lined up all over the store. I opted for the special which was Nutella french toast. Seriously, how did I not think of this before. Nutella french toast is the BEST! The servers were a little inattentive but the amazing Nutella french toast and Eggs Benedict made up for it! I would definitely head back to this place if not to just wander around the store and look at all the lovely kettles!"}
{"text":"We stopped in I had an amazing omelette and my wife enjoyed a vegetarian sandwich with a salad."}
{"text":"The Lazy Loaf & Kettle reminds me of a small town bakery and cafe, but with a big city price tag. It's located in this crescent I've never stopped in before, one with a quilting store and a ladies' clothing store. It was no surprise that most of the clientele (at least at lunch time on this particular weekday) were mostly women, and mostly 40-60.

If you're coming for a sandwich, be sure to grab yourself a slip of paper and a marker at the front till. That's how the orders are done. Want extra meat? It costs extra (learning from the guy in from of me who assumed he could have a couple of different kinds... choosing his meat toppings like he chose his vegetable toppings).

I went with a half turkey soup, a bowl of cream of broccoli soup and a bottle of water. All that came out to just shy of $15 including GST. I grabbed my number and hunkered down at a nearby table. It wasn't too longer before a very full half sandwich and a decent-sized bowl of soup were set in front of me. Tasty? Yes! Satisfying? Absolutely! Sandwiches on in-house baked bread and piled up with fresh ingredients have a little extra TLC attached in my mind. It's just a wee-bit more than I'm used to paying for the portion. It should've included the other half of my sandwich.

Tip: If you want water, save yourself a couple of dollars and go for the jug around the corner! And check out the pile of day-old baked goods off to the side. It looked like there were some goodies in there."}
{"text":"As a self proclaimed coffee-addict, I can honestly say i've tried nearly every coffee shop there is in Calgary- and I can honestly say, The Lazy Loaf & Kettle is my favourite one. First, there is a reason why it is packed on a typical lunch hour: the coffee is good, the food is better and the service is undeniable. The crowd that they attract varies from young students getting a quick lunch while they study (free wifi included), first dates, business people looking for a place to meet and seniors looking for a nice place to get a soup, sandwich and coffee. Everyone is welcome here in The Lazy Loaf's welcoming home cooked feel. 

The parking is a little hard to get used to as it is a smaller lot and only 1-2 hour parking, so it is advised to find another route there, or to go at an earlier time. They open at 7am and you'll usually find me there for their amazing breakfast, but if you're not a morning person, they serve it until 3pm. And if you don't like breakfast, their sandwiches are unbeatable! 

I would definitely recommend The Lazy Loaf & Kettle to any friend, acquaintance, stranger and their dog, anytime."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Lazy Loaf!  Lazy loaf is just off Parkdale Crescent NW along with other small shops and restaurants.  It's near the ice cream stop - Lic's.  They do have a parking lot but it is shared so on weekends it can get quite packed.  The first time I visited lazy loaf was last year and it was love at first sight.  I walked into a display of fresh baked cakes, squares, cookies, breads, loaves.  It was really heaven for me.  My first ever visit, I was on some stupid diet so I didn't have any sweets (I KNOW RIGHT?) - I remember I had a sandwich and the ordering process is quite simple.  You grab a piece of paper, check off what you want and bring it to the front.  Their in house bread is quite good.  You are able to order half sandwiches as well.  I noticed they offer soups, salads and pastas as well as they have typical breakfasts in the morning.  There is not really a designated area to line up so people line up along the display and into the dining area.  It can get a bit tight if it's busy and sometimes I'm sure it can be a pain to find a seat.

This review is based mainly on the baked goodies.  I visit Lazy Loaf when I'm craving something sweet (all the time) and I'm always excited to visit because they have cake pops, macarons, other squares and cakes that change throughout the week so it can be a surprise the next time I walk in.  Lazy loaf has the best carrot cake I've tried - super moist and the cream cheese is sweet and delicious.  The ginger cookie sandwich is amazing - two huge soft ginger cookies with a heaping of cream cheese frosting in the middle, these can get messy if you try and break off pieces as it squishes the cream and goes all over but nonetheless always tasty!  The chocolate cake here is one of my favorite in the city - just please try it, you won't regret it.  Dense but moist cake (yes dense but moist) with some amazing chocolate frosting in between the layers, I'm not sure if its chocolate cream cheese but whatever it is, it's top notch.  I've had the turtle brownie, again, amazing.  It's heavy but when you bite into it, it's like you wouldn't expect this dense brownie to be soft, the caramel and pecans on top is a sweet sweet sin.  Right now, they've got a peanut butter cup and its really good, chocolate layer with homemade peanut filling - I tell myself there is protein in these cups so I don't feel as guilty.

I promise the moment you walk in, you'll be excited! Because every time I walk into lazy loaf (which is quite often) I'm ALWAYS excited.

Lazy Loaf, thank you for always being there for my sweet tooth *emoji with heart eyes*"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh and homemade. They have different breads every day of the week that they bake in the back and it's really good! I found their Moroccan lentil soup nice and unique. Their treats are humongous (their cookies are bigger than my face) and they're pretty delicious. The place looks like a truck stop diner with a hipster flair. Really nice, I'll definitely be back when I'm craving a fresh sandwich or homemade soup!"}
{"text":"Finally got to sit down in Lazy Loaf and enjoy myself for a quiet evening sandwich! I was at an event over at the Parkdale Community Centre for work, and really needed to get out of there. I walked over to Lazy Loaf and much to my surprise it was pretty quiet. I guess it might have been because it was Remembrance Day and maybe not a lot of people were around. 
I ordered my favourite veggie sandwich, a side salad, and a cup of yoga tea. The salad portion was a lot larger and greener than I expected, which I was very happy about. This much food had me absolutely stuffed, which as awesome. A very nice quiet place to read some Leonard Cohen and hide from the world for half an hour, although I am aware it isn't always like this. This particular review update simply reflects my Lazy Loaf experience. The Lazy Loaf seems to be part hipster coffeehouse, part diner, and part truckstop vibe. 
Also, the quality, and $5 price tag on Lazy Loaf's gigantic loaves of bread means no one in Calgary ever has any excuse to buy bread at a regular grocery store again. I took home a loaf of sour dough with slices longer than my torso (figuratively) and was the happiest Sarah Louise in all the land! I definitely advise that even if you don't feel like sitting down, you pop in here for a delicious loaf of their bread. 

(6/30)"}
{"text":"I stepped in here for brunch today and wow this place continues to impress. The name of the venue isn't misleading at all. Once you eat that homemade bread with your breakfast you will indeed feel quite lazy.  It's overall a more wholesome experience. The place is always packed but I typically seem to find seating. My only complaint is they aren't open a lot and their hours are unusual so make sure you check before going."}
{"text":"Great hidden get away for pastries, soups and sandwich in the NW. Food and coffee are really good. Location is unique. Ordering process could use some improvement. The staff are friendly and you can settle in with a book or a good place for friends to gather."}
{"text":"This was an amazing surprise that I stumbled upon. The food was great. Staff were very nice. Place was busy. Parking sucks so be wary. You order your sandwich on piece of paper with a highlighter. Very cool concept. I will certainly return."}
{"text":"Based on my experience over the years, The Lazy Loaf can do no wrong.  I've eaten their catered food more times than I can count and the sandwiches are always perfection.  Not once have I even been mildly disappointed in anything I've eaten.  In person, it's a busy but cozy place.  

I will admit that I've been thankful for the catering experiences because I would consider prices a bit on the high side.  There is potential for parking to be a major hassle.  Regardless, I will accept the cons once in awhile to enjoy food made with love."}
{"text":"OMG. Why have I never been here since my move?????????

I haven't eaten in 5 days because all food has been tasted pre-made and disgusting. 

I had a hankering for a veggie Sammy - woo hoo!!!

Pick all your fixings and hand in a slip - prepare for a Delish ride. Fresh bread, fresh veggies, I even went all out and had cheese!!

DH had a 1/2 turkey and said it was really good. Our 6 year old had the beef lasagna with a side Caesar salad. 

Salad tasted great, lasagna looked & smelled great - they also have a vegetarian option!!!!!

I had a full veggie with Dijon on wheat, 2 cheeses & all the fixings.

2 beers ( Kronenburg Blanc) & Cream Soda

Came to just under $50, which may seem steep, but not if you appreciate fresh food.

All enjoyed on a picnic bench in the shade with our dogs. Sweet family dinner.

I'm already thinking of coming back tomorrow....seriously, get there.

Thank you guys!!"}
{"text":"Coffee, fluffy baked stuff and straight forward breakfasts are on point.
I often drop in for a loaf of fresh or day-old bread (although sometimes the bread can be a bit dense when the b-team is baking) their signature loaf is a great loaf of bread.
After a bike ride along the Bow it's nice to stop in for a coffee and a baked thing or sit down for a more substantial breakfast.
The baked things are big, with lots of frosting and stuff and the breakfast are pretty traditional.
You can also draft your own sandwich while you wait in line at lunch, that's kinda fun.
And they do run some nice lunch and dinner specials along the lines of chili or lasagna.
They bang it out so its all usually nice and fresh."}
{"text":"I love me some lazy loaf. In high school a friend of mine would go into town (I went to Springbank) on her spare. At lunch she would reappear with these sandwiches that drool would intensely collect in my mouth. It took me 4 years to figure out where these magical sandwiches came from. It's family run (by a great family),you build your sandwiches with a highlighter, it's hard to ignore the deserts (the cream cheese ginger cookie... Marry me)  and they really have made the loaf a great community bakery. 

If you haven't been here yet, you haven't experienced calgary sandwich royalty. This is a bakery all bakery should aspire to be."}
{"text":"So I went here on a Friday evening/night and it was lovely. There were tons of places to sit, both inside and out. It's a pretty large place, so I can't imagine it packed, but it's pastries and coffee are delicious so I guess I can see how it would get that way. 

I live on the other side of town, so I just went here to meet up with some folks. I don't know if I would drive across town just for the Lazy Loaf, but I will definitely stop by the next time I'm in the area. They have delicious pastries (and even some vegan/gluten free/dairy free options!) and their sandwiches looked tasty as well. Even on a Friday afternoon, the coffee was fresh and delicious. Since it was a Friday, I added a little Kahlua to it (perfect option for a Friday, eh? ^_~). 

Anyway, this is a cafe shop and hang-out spot. If you live in the area, I would say it's definitely worth a visit...or two, or three."}
{"text":"Can't be beat for an excellent and fresh made-to-order sandwich.  Nice breakfast and desert items as well.  Makes you overlook the poor execution (see below). 

The layout is super poorly thought out - takeout customers have no place to stand while waiting for your order, you are literally tripping over the servers and others in line.  This place could use a properly designed renovation, it sort of comes across as something that was bootstrapped with no money and then became popular and they never had time to redesign to accommodate the higher customer flow and properly reflect their level of success.

Staff are not the most friendly and generally seem overrun and stressed.

Parking is usually pretty easy, angled street parking right out front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Very nice coffee shop..  The desserts are delicious!!,... The place is very cozy and the coffee is great.. The service is not bad... I want to go back there to try more things!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! They make the best cinnamon buns in the city! The food is always good. Coffee is good. Staff is kind. Great cafe!! The perfect way to start a weekend!!"}
{"text":"Hash browns tasted like they were boiled. Tasted rubbery, they looked good though haha. Eggs beeny were ehh. Interior is pretty old school.  Service was alright. You order up front and they bring the food to you. Roomy on a Tuesday, late morning. 

But I always go for the food. And this place did not live up to the reviews. Places I rather goto include , monki, grumans, holy grill for breakfast.

Would not return."}
{"text":"First, good luck finding parking at lunchtime. Or a table.  If you're a first timer, the ordering can be confusing with the little sheets to fill out.  If you make it through all that, the food is fresh, good and homemade.  Expensive though.  For my daughter, daughter-in-law and I it came to over $32!  They each had soup, salad and a bun, i had 1/2 sandwich and salad.  No drinks, no dessert....and before tip.  Simple order and they also managed to screw it up.  Granted it was busy....If i were ever in the area again, i'd go 'off-time', definitely NOT between 11-2:30.  I gave it three stars b/c it's hard to find a place that does soup and salad in Calgary that's not a chain restaurant and the food WAS fresh and the bread was delicious. Service could use some fine-tuning.  
Also, found it to be kind of a mommy-group clientelle.  Lots of kids in strollers.  And it's NOT a big place."}
{"text":"Fun for weekend breakfast. Popular with the running crowd along the river side. French toast a bit dry for my taste."}
{"text":"Look carefully for this place, because it's not easily noticeable.  It's located right off Bowness Road in a tiny little strip mall.  There's no big sign that says 'Lazy Loaf,' so basically, unless you know it's there you can't find it.

I'd recommend looking really hard for this place because it's quite the gem.  It specializes in soups, salads and sandwiches and has a somewhat unique take on service.  Every places their order at from the front counter, pays for it, and then takes a seat somewhere in the restaurant.  You are given a number after buying your meal and it's brought out to you when it's ready.  It's nice because you can just relax and chill at a table while your food is being prepared.

A crummy thing about their set-up is that you can be waiting quite some time for your food to come.  I mean, it's just sandwiches and pre-made soups and salads.  I couldn't believe when we waited almost 15 minutes for our sandwiches to come, and it wasn't even that busy.  In that amount of time I could order food and have it brought to me from a restaurant.  I just expected the meal to come a little quicker than that, I guess.

I'll give it to them that the sandwich and soup I had was just delicious!  It was a freshly made zucchini soup and a ham and swiss sandwich, although, for $10 I could have eaten a bit more.  I wasn't quite full after eating my half sandwich and soup.  It seemed a bit expensive for the portions you receive.

I did like that I got to choose each and every topping that went on my sandwich.  They have little pieces of paper with all the stuff you can put on a sandwich for you to mark off available at the front.  This includes everything from your choice of bread to veggies, to meat, to cheeses, to spreads.  It's really quite amazing.

The atmosphere is cool and the idea is unique.  I just wish that it wasn't so expensive or I would go there more!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! It's one of Calgary's hole in the wall restaurants that promises a setting with character and good, good food. When I was there the soup of the day was sausage and cabbage soup. Fantastic! The place may be a little difficult to find. The sign is difficult to see. But boy what a find when you find it."}
{"text":"I've gone to the Lazy Loaf & Kettle a bunch of times in the last 10 years. More recently I have been disappointed with the service I have received. 

This summer I went on two different occasions on a quieter afternoon and waited a very lengthy amount of time for a simple sandwich. Both times there were approximately 4 to 5 orders ahead of me and it has taken at least 25 minutes. Some orders placed after me received their meals before us as well. It doesn't make sense why such a simple operation takes so long. Won't be going back for a while. Food is too basic and takes too long."}
