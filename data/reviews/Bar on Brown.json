{"text":"Stopped in for a bite last evening and waited too long to be acknowledged, and then too long to be given menus and offered drinks. So long, in fact, that we left. Can't recall the last time I saw such poor customer service."}
{"text":"We do take out from here because the food is freshly prepared well seasoned.  If you are a chips person, you'll be pleased with the homemade potato chips that come with sandwiches.  The kitchen has gotten better each week since they've opened.  You end up spending just pennies more than a chainWAY sub shop or less than you would at a chain bar/restaurant but the food is better.   Well done."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, the bartender was nice as can be the food was great. They need more of a big sign so people know its there."}
{"text":"It's a decent place to go overall. Nice back deck. Cell phone service sucks in this bar but the crowd is always a good mix of people who are all friendly. The menu is great in theory but I find the food to be mediocre overall."}
{"text":"Drove past the place many times since we live nearby however we never went in. When we heard that a friend Steve was the bartender on Wednesdays and Sundays we just had to stop. To our surprise the place was quite cozy.  Waiting for Steve to arrive we ordered drinks and dinner. I like craft beers and they had a small but good variety of craft beer on tap.  Our server was quite attentive and steered us toward foods to try on the menu.  I just ordered the stuffed banana peppers and my wife ordered a salmon salad. Both dishes were good enough that we will return. I gave the place 3 stars because we need another visit to try other food before giving it a higher rating. As strong believers of patronizing local businesses we encourage you give Bar on Brown a try."}
{"text":"Bar on Brown graciously hosted my company for a small client gathering recently. We discovered it on a whim and I contacted them to see if they would be available to host us on an evening that they are typically closed. They made securing the space and menu completely effortless. When I arrived, I was immediately impressed. The place itself is very nice, seating is comfortable, it has a great layout. Rich, one of the owners, was kind enough to warmly welcome me and show me around. They have an AWESOME outdoor space with fire pits, comfortable seating, and games, while it was a little too cool on the evening we were there to enjoy it, I could definitely see it being a great place to hang out in the warmer weather. Beyond that, the food and service was excellent and I was reminded why I love small businesses so much. You could definitely tell that everyone at Bar on Brown cares about their customers and I left with a great impression of them and their establishment. Great beer selections and food was great as well. Thanks so much to you guys for your hospitality! You are wonderful and I highly recommend for either a private party or just to hang with friends for a beer and some tasty food!"}
{"text":"Get with the times! I've stopping in Bar on brown for awhile now. The food when you get it had been pretty good. The service had been spotty @ best. Recently on Wednesdays   The service had been much better & more professional. I tried to to take a group of 12 there tonight for brews n bites. They r closed do to inclimate weather or just finally closed. Anyway if u r going to b in business in this day & age use the social media so you're customers can b made aware of operational changes. Looks like we're heading  to the Churchill house. There FB page says there open.."}
{"text":"We've had the experience to visit this new establishment two times. And neither time were we disappointed especially because it is non-smoking. The interior design is inviting, attractive and comfortable. Comfortable for both the seating and the atmosphere. The owners, staff and customers are all friendly so it feels like an upscale Cheers. In addition to the most comfortable barstools ever (and a place to charge your phone by your barstool), there is a 3-season deck in the back with wonderful seating and TVs. This is our new Steeler Sunday go-to bar with reasonably priced drinks and a complimentary half-time spread.  The only drawback is that the kitchen is not yet up and running.   Come in and see for yourself. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really cool bar, great staff, but the food is awful. I've been here twice to eat. I  wasn't impressed the first time, but I decided to give it another shot. I got a bacon burger, and my girlfriend got the Rueben. The burger was very bland, the fries were pretty much raw, the coleslaw wasn't great either. My girlfriend said the same about the Rueben. I think we'll just stick to having drinks at this bar."}
