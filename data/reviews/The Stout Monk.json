{"text":"Always have such a great time at this pub. Great service, good food and great beer variety!"}
{"text":"Fav pub in town. Service is always great even when the place gets rammed. Unlike most pubs, they offer new monthly dishes which is a nice touch. My go-to bar for sure."}
{"text":"I'm a quasi-regular at this joint. I must say I like it; one of the better pubs in Oakville to swill down a few pints and watch a game. Despite the Pine-Sol smell issue addressed by BJ (which drastically needs to be addressed), it's a good spot. The food used to be brutal, but it seems as though they've gotten their act together for the most part. Actually, I find the staff to be awesome here; better than most places. I never have to wait for a drink, food, or the bill. Amazing.   No real complaints. They've upped some of their prices, but it's nothing outrageous. Solid spot that is doing good business for a reason."}
{"text":"Staff here excellent, best wings in Oakville for sure, some monthly specials outstanding, food generally well above typical pubs in the area, very attentive and friendly staff! Lots of regulars, always a good sign!"}
{"text":"Simply put, I'm a local, here are my experiences over 3 years time: Pros: - clean pub - close by - decent selection of drafts  Cons: - smells like Pine-sol 24/7 - VERY expensive beer for the area  (about 25% more!) - indifferent staff - Aloof owner who is more concerned about his golfing regulars than anyone else - regulars: upscale, but see owner comment above-not friendly if you don't golf  Strange vibe in here. Definitely not a place where you can start a conversation up with anyone.  Many friendly pubs in the area - try Niblick, Greyfriars, Tin Cup is THE best if you want friendly and atmosphere.  Take the Monk as a last resort"}
{"text":"So we live around the corner now, and my husband has decided this place is his new watering hole.  We have 2 young kids, and we were happy to find out that there is a kids menu as well.  The kids menu has the usual suspects like chicken fingers, grilled cheese etc.  But we like the wings.  Here, you can have them grilled, battered or fried.  All the flavours (I think we tried 4) were all delicious and even the kids liked them.  The nachos are behemoth and definitely a meal if served for 2.  We shared them as an appetizer with friends and between the 4 of us, we couldn't finish them.    The only thing I can fault them for is their speed.  Every time we go (albeit during dinner hours) we have to wait quite a long time for our food.  The kids are always restless near the last few moments, and I always kick myself for not getting there before the rush.  So I'm happy for them they're so busy, but I'm always slightly annoyed when I realize I've been waiting an hour for food.  Maybe it's so I drink more while waiting?!  In any case, we'll be back.  Lots of other food items on the menu that I have to try!"}
{"text":"Very average place. I felt wings were not fresh, a bit more chewy than normal. Good imported selection of beer ( my fav Carlsberg) but not served cold enough:(. Service was slow. My first order of wings took good 30 minutes.   Place is cozy though."}
{"text":"I come here once every 7 years or so. Good selection of beers and a nice neighborhood pub. Maybe I'll try the food in 2023."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at this pub. First impressions were good - the atmosphere was great during the hockey game.   I ordered calamari and fried pickles as the appetizers. Fried pickles were good. Calamari, on the other hand, was not. There was barely any breading on them and the calamari itself was stringy - I ended up returning the dish to the waitress as it was inedible. My entree was the pork sandwich which was OK, but nothing special.   Service was mediocre - drinks were emptied before the waitress came around and it took forever for her to bring drinks and the machine for payment.   Overall, I was not impressed with the food, the staff or the general experience. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is a pretty decent pub in a suburban plaza. I tried the burger and onion rings. The burger appeared to be a frozen patty (mine and my dining companions' burger patties all had the same scalloped-edge look to them) and there wasn't much of a beef flavour to these patties. They also suffered from being underseasoned and overcooked. The bun was also a bit too firm for my burger preferences.    The onion rings were okay, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"A clean, vibrant British-style pub in north Oakville. Afternoons and evenings are usually well populated, and it only ever gets crowded on Friday and Saturday nights (when you want it to be). The draught selection is pretty darn good, and they've got 5-6 LCD TV's showing (usually) great sports stuff. But don't confuse this for a sports bar...you're just as likely to see a young family with kids and grandparents in tow, as you are to see hipsters and yuppies enjoying a pint or three.  While there are more than a handful of good British pubs in Oakville, the Stout Monk has no equals within five kilometers and is a great local haunt."}
{"text":"Used to eat and drink at the Stout Monk when I lived in Oakville must try the nacho plater best plater anywhere and really good chicken wings and if your a beer drinker the Guinness is fresh and poured well good place for group events or team events. Kirstyn and Jen both have amazing personalities and Jen pours a really good pint of Guinness and the rest of the staff are amazing."}
{"text":"Best place for nachos and beer. The fully loaded nachos are huge and can feed at least 3-4 people. The variety of toppings are great so you don't get sick of the nachos - part of it has chili, part of it has beef, part of it has pork etc. I also enjoyed the calamari. They also used to have these huge pints of hoegaarden but I believe it is no longer available."}
{"text":"After a long day of boarding, we decided to stop in for some drinks and dinner. I've walked pay this place several times, but have ever gone in. On a suggestion from a friend we stopped in.  It was a Sunday, and it was early enough that the place was relatively quiet. The menu is largely English/Pub style food, they have a monthly feature that references Brick Lane (my husband and I had some of the best Indian food on that street in London).   Most of us had the Sunday roast beef dinner. It came with a garden salad to start and a plate with garlic mashed potatoes, steamed veggies, Yorkshire pudding and slices of roast beef in gravy. Yum. A perfect meal to end a day of snowboarding.  This place is a good pub, they have great Guinness (it has it's own tap), and the food is decent. Not a bad place if you want a decent meal."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times to grab a drink with a friend and to my disappointment, they had no pitchers! I find that odd for a bar, and I feel they should offer them in the future to keep customers coming back. I know for sure I won't be going back there just because if this... It works out cheaper for the customer to get a pitcher than order individual pints over and over again!   Overall, the location was fine, I would recommend you try it out,  but for anyone who wants to drink with a group, this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. The service is friendly yet distracted and no attentive. The atmosphere is cozy but is quite loud, even for a pub. The food is not great and barely passes as decent. I wouldn't recommend anyone to come here unless you are a nachos fanatic. The nachos here are the only good thing about this place and make the place worth a visit."}
{"text":"Fabulous service!  And the food is over the top amazing.  The bacon pot pie is the pick of the day for me!  Nothing better than seeing an owner work and help the staff along with asking the guests how the food is.  Very satisfied with the overall experience and will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here at 2pm with 14 other guys after our hockey game at 16 Mile.  The bar area and surrounding tables were full but a room that would seat approximately 35-50 was empty.  We sat down since we were not greeted after standing in the entrance for a couple minutes.   After sitting for a few minutes we found a server who was chatting with another server at the back of the bar and when she came over, told us that the room was reserved.  There were no reserved signs, and we explained that we would only be long enough for a quick pint each, maybe an hour max, if we had time to order food if it didn't conflict with the reservation she claimed.  Unfortunately, the server didn't know the time of the reservation but told us we couldn't use the space so we left.  All 15 of us will not be returning, especially with our families in the future."}
{"text":"Saturday night who wants to cook?  Drove over to our local pub.  It's a pretty open place with dark decor.  Seat yourself, smiles, and friendly service.   Typical pub food plus some variety for picky eaters.  Ordered the lemon pepper salmon and the steak frites with salad instead of fries.  Food was fresh and tasty and the service was very friendly .  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic wings, open late with food service, awesome service and great sports team support."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate the food and service separately. I'd give the food 4 stars and the service 3, but since 3.5 would round up to 4, I went with 4. Servers are nice enough and they seem to be constantly moving-- it's not like they're just standing around. However, I think there may be too few of them, and you have to work to get their attention when you need something.   It can get quite loud in this restaurant when there's a game on. If that's your scene, it could be a enjoyable place to watch the game.   It's your typical dark wooden exterior, low lighting pub-type place. There's ample seating at the bar or at table and a number of televisions.   They have surprisingly good pasta for a pub! Maybe it's just because we're so starved for adequate Italian restaurants in Oakville, but the Baked Three Cheese Tortellini is fantastic! Also, you cannot go wrong with the Sticky Toffee Pudding."}
{"text":"Ah-okay place!!  I would rather say another pub in the town.  The good thing about the place is that they have small room/ enclosures for meet-ups or private gatherings.   Drinks menu is okay too.  Food was not upto my expectations."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend on Wednesday night. Place was quite busy as there was a game on but the service was still prompt and efficient. We ordered fried calamari and chicken quesadillas to share. The calamari was decent, not too chewy and the batter was light. The quesadillas were fantastic with the perfect amount of filing. You have the option of white or whole wheat pita which I thought was great for a pub. They only brought sour cream and I had to ask for salsa but that wouldn't stop me from ordering again.  The pint of Keith's I ordered was tasty and reasonably priced but it would have been nice if they served it in a chilled glass."}
{"text":"Came here to watch a blue Jays playoff game with a party of 8. It was packed. But the service was spectacular. They were able to scrounge up a table Of 8 for us quickly despite the busy night.   Food- just alright. Ordered the chicken tenders with a side of honey garlic sauce. Fries were subbed for sweet potato. All in all just okay. Nothing foodie spectacular.   More of an environment for picking appetizers & drinks to watch a game. (Their nachos looked humongous). I'd eat at Big Wolfs first then swing over :)   Good experience overall. If I'm in the area I'd be sure to drop by for a game or quick drinks!"}
{"text":"Breaded wings are the bestest!!! :) The waitresses are very nice. Regardless of how busy it gets they always remember you. Try their Nachos...but you will need atleast 3 people to finish it. Its HUGE! :)  Their sticky Toffee cake is the best desert I have ever had! It's sooo worth it!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I recently ate at this pub for a date and both of us were left unimpressed.  We both like pub fare and looking over the menu, there is a lot to choose from. I wasn't as hungry as my Husband was, so I thought I'd get the nachos. He, meanwhile, got a spinach and artichoke dip appetizer and the polish special, which was sausage with perogies.   The spinach dip was good. Not the best I've ever had, but certainly not the worst.  The nachos platter was huge. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I was unimpressed with the amount of cheese put on. It was mostly tortilla chips with a little bit of melted shredded cheese. Due to the lack of cheese, it was terribly dry and I didn't like it.  My Husband's order didn't look right. It had baked beans all over it and mashed potatoes. Looking over the menu, we realized they had accidentally given him the bangers and mash. We called the waitress over and she was kind enough to have them make the correct order. They even took it off our bill since it took so long, which we didn't expect.  However, while my Husband was thrilled with how good the perogies were, he was less than enamored with the sausage, which was actually pretty disgusting tasting.  Our bill was actually pretty small for how much we got thanks to their kindness of removing my Husband's meal. We tipped well and left. I don't honestly think we'll be back - there are lots of pubs around, so why stick to a substandard one?"}
