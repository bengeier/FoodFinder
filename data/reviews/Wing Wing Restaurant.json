{"text":"Just bad, the worst I've ever had. It sucks! The orange beef is, more of soup, just wrong. It disgusting, disturbed, do not order this."}
{"text":"Terrible. The bbq pork was tough as old boots. The eggplant dish tasted like a mistake. The fried rice was liking eating saw dust. The noodles were devoid of flavour. Never again"}
{"text":"I used to An still do kinda get food from here Cus I do enjoy it  not to Mention that the ppl are really nice so that makes it even more better"}
{"text":"We ordered in:  * beef and broccoli- NO BEEF! And whatever beef was in there was tough and over cooked.  * lemon chicken - Was cold and came with the lemon sauce on the side.  * house fried rice - tasteless  * egg roll/spring rolls were good  * chicken wing - were good   $36 later and one of the worst meals I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Love it, my favorite Chinese food place. Real good wonton soup. We don't live in the area of delivery no more so we will drive the 20 min sometimes for it..good pricing and also 10% if paying cash"}
{"text":"If you're craving for some fried rice, sweet&sour chicken balls, golden deep fried chicken wings this is definitely the spot...I've tried a few spots in the East York area and this place seems to be the best value+quality if that's all you want. My go-to spot when I'm feeling some non-authentic Chinese food :)"}
{"text":"It's one of those cheap neighbor spots. $6.99 combos. easy seating, nothing fancy, alot of food and it's pretty good!"}
