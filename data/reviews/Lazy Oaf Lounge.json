{"text":"AVOID!!! ordered on grubhub, they took the order and the money is going to be held for a week in my account. After they took the order and the money, then they decided that they were \"too busy\" to deliver what was agreed."}
{"text":"This is a favorite with people at work. It's close, good prices, daily specials, trivia night, and some great brick oven pizza! Real crispy crust! Friendly staff, good selection of brews, a nice patio, and plenty of parking round out the reasons we keep going back!"}
{"text":"We went last night to listen to Northern Hooks ,the band was great. This was out first time. We liked the bar. It was fairly busy not much for indoor seating. There is a pool table ,a dart board. 
 The staff was good. We only got two beers lots to choose from. They did ask after a bit if we wanted food. So we got some cheese curds. The price was a little scary $7.00 for cheese curds. They were hot when they came out served with ranch. They were light and crisp but the cheese inside was not great.
There was a lot of cheese curds so that did make up for the price. 

Everyone was ordering pizza that looked and smelled great. They are thick crust. They seem to offer thin crust if you ask. 
We will be back to try the pizza. They have drink specials it seems every day."}
{"text":"Love the lazy oaf! Their food is cheaper than the average restaurant and there are lots of choices!! There are always food and drink specials that are fun to try and they post the specials on their Facebook page which is super convenient. I'm always helped really fast and my food comes out at a good pace. Sometimes they have karaoke or trivia night and live bands on the weekends! I'd recommend going during a packer game day! They have raffles and drawings, it is super fun! Also I have never ever been charged for a refill...

One thing that is most important to me is that a girl can feel safe, welcome, and comfortable at a bar and I always do!"}
{"text":"The food was average at best... the server was far from friendly and solidifying my decision to never visit the place again."}
{"text":"They lie about having karaoke. Don't go, it's a trap. That's all I have to say, but they tell me it's too short for a review."}
{"text":"Fantastic wraps and pizza that we all shared! 
Awesome beer selection!
Great service, I would defiantly come back soon."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great and it's fun to go on the nights they have trivia! Pizza is awesome."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my recent experience with this restaurant.  
My boyfriend and I order here about once a week or so, and have it delivered. Our last order we did not receive all the items we paid for. 
The food is usually decent but if you order online please keep in mind that not all of you food may arrive and it may or may not be good."}
{"text":"I love this place. I hope that Benjamin will give it another try. I've never had to pay for soda refills and have never had a bad meal. This is my go to lunch spot. I can always count on them to have a delicious soup and the wait staff is very friendly and attentive. My favorite is the \"spicy oaf\" burger which I get as a veggie burger. It is a nice veggie patty with pepper jack cheese, jalapenos, and a spicy red pepper spread. The are served on the freshest ciabatta rolls that I've had since moving to Madison. A big plus for The Lazy Oaf is that you can substitute the fries with either a salad or soup."}
{"text":"This venue charges for soda refills, which is absolutely unacceptable to me.

I had the grilled cheese sandwich with vegetables - the veggies were  very good, and the pesto worked well.  The cheese was barely there and the bread was basically store bought white bread.

Prices were normal for the local area.  Service was somewhat slow but otherwise acceptable.

Honestly, if you want better food and service, try Dexters or Ale Asylum or any chain place."}
{"text":"For those describing this place as a dive bar have probably never been in a dive bar. Good bar fare vittles, pleasant customers, fair prices. Speakers a bit too loud on game days tho."}
{"text":"Suuuuuuper disappointed. We ordered two batches of wings and they had feathers under the breading. 
The salad was ok but we all decided to toss all the wings."}
{"text":"Pizza was cold and half done. Discussed this with waitress. She offered me a box and said I could heat it up at home!!! What? Won't be going back"}
{"text":"Working on the far east side, there aren't a lot of fun places to go with the coworkers after a long day. Thankfully the Oaf has come along. The comfy couches and plenty of seating inside are great for hanging out in both small and large groups. With the wonderful early spring weather we've been having, the patio area has been great. There is tons of room out there to soak up the sun. 

The food is pretty decent too. They have a big brick oven pizza in the the corner that helps deliver some tasty pies at a reasonable price. I also like that you can get a whole wheat crust as an option. The many appetizers they have are yummy fried goodness that help soak out the alcohol from the many fine beers they have on tap (including ale asylum and fat tire)."}
{"text":"The taco pizza we ordered was mushy slop. Very disappointing given they claim to have a fire brick pizza oven. If we go here again, we will likely order a salad or burgers or something and see if that's any better."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in,  we had slow, rude service!  When I complained about the pizza, being 45 minutes late,  the bartender snapped at me, then, told me to talk to man in charge. ...he ended up tossing the pizza on to the table next to my  friend,  who ordered it , rudely.  The owner came over and asked us what was wrong , by demanding how much pizza we ate....! (There Was 1 Piece gone) Wrong Pizza,  By The way! Another lady, (manager) was trying to buy us off with a free shot.... we told her that's not what we want...it's the service, we were disappointed with. ..they, then pushed me out and had a bartender escorted me out and ended up pushing me to the ground!!! No joke!"}
{"text":"Place is good. Lunchtime is the best. Been here late at night once. Very different clientele. The bartender was a huge hipster and was pretty much judging anyone who walked in. Further the kitchen closes at 9pm or 10pm on some nights. Was sent here by another establishment under the guise that they served food late. They don't."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and have a good draft beer. Bartenders are friendly and good-looking--Ryan is my favorite. Not because I'm attracted to him though. 
Big enough to accommodate a large group and the food is decent too. Check it out."}
{"text":"Had a good selection of beers. Stopped here before my graduation (don't judge ;P). We ordered a few appetizers in which I forgot what they were. Either way this seems like a nice place to grab a sandwich and some suds. 

Friendly staff
Great prices
Plenty of seating"}
{"text":"Ok place.  Ordered barbeque pizza and it was cold in the middle.  Told waiter and he comped meal without asking.  The rest of the food was fine.  I'll give it one more try to see if they can redeem themselves."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday and ordered the baked cod.  It was covered in sort of a crunchy bread crumb thing, and to me it was like saying, \"No.  You were wrong you really wanted battered and fried cod.\"  I never got my soup.  Didn't want it after the other food.  The food came relatively quickly.

My wife ordered the Thai peanut chicken salad.  She said there was a sauce on the chicken that was good but she didn't have enough for the salad, so she asked for more Thai-peanut dressing.  Evidently they had forgotten the Thai-peanut dressing because it was disgusting.  Let me give you the recipe:  Sriracha sauce mixed with cheap creamy peanut butter and a little Italian dressing to thin it out.  I'll eat pretty much anything and even I left it.  $6.50 for a can of Strongbow seems a little high for Madison, but the food was reasonably priced.  The check was $22 something and the waitress didn't bring my change from $25, so I didn't tip any more.  The waitstaff also seemed really disorganized as if all the tables were whoever gets there first gets it rather than splitting them up.  

I wanted to like it because I live nearby and they have a nice patio, but I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Great staff, nice beer selection, solid menu. Trivia and music make for great atmosphere. An Oasis on the North side. Lucky to have it around."}
{"text":"Skip it.  I tried the Lazy Oaf because it is an establishment near my home that many of my friends have encouraged me to try.  

In my desire to find the best beef in town, I ordered the Italian Beef sandwich.  The meat was so fatty it was impossible to bite.  The description of the sandwich explained that it came with mozzarella cheese.  I had to open my sandwich and actively search for the tiny pieces of cheese.  The bread was a warm ciabatta roll.  That was the saving grace for the entire meal.  The portion was small for $8.50.  I ate my sandwich because I was really hungry but it was too salty and sub-par.  The meat was luke warm.  I am not going to lie when I say it was probably the worst thing I gave ever eaten at a restaurant.  Dramatic?  No.  I actually thought to myself, McDonald's could do it better.

I ordered it with a side salad which was actually delicious.  It was a spinach and spring mix.  

So two stars?  Why not one.  The martinis.  It was Monday and Happy Hour lasted all night.  So for $5 you can get a generously poured martini.  I tried both the chocolate and apple martini.  Honestly, delicious. Great deal.  They have a patio that sits on a slow part of Stoughton road.  So go for the cocktails, but skip the food.

I should add that Annie, our server, was wonderful.  She was attentive and yet not hovering."}
{"text":"I'm writing an update because this is one of the first times I've ever actually been angry about the service I've gotten somewhere.  I've tended bar before, as well as waited tables, so I have a pretty high tolerance for bad employees because food service can be tough.  But there's really no excuse for how terrible this place is.

Since my last review, I've been here three times.  The first two times were just averagely crappy.  But two weeks ago was the worst.  I took some out of town guests here for a drink to enjoy the patio.  The bartender first made half of the drinks wrong.  When I went back to order a beer, I waited several minutes while the \"bartender\" stood right in front of me messing around on his phone.  When I finally got to order, he just stared at me blankly for a really long time, asking me to repeat myself several times.  He came back with one of two beers I ordered and then proceeded to pour me a shot that I never ordered.  It took a really long time to make him understand that I was actually ordering beer from their tap list.  It wasn't very busy or loud either.  If you're going to come to work high, at least be functional.  The other two bartenders working were just as terrible and one was incredibly and unnecessarily rude to some people sitting near us.  

I honestly don't know where any of these good reviews are coming from.  Maybe there's a secret day of the week when all the competent employees work?  It's a shame because the patio is nice and it's a good location.  I wish there was a decent business here."}
{"text":"Went for the first time tonight. Too crowded and loud. Not a pleasant atmosphere. Drinks were mediocre.  Won't be going here again."}
{"text":"This has become my go to place from airport.Have heard pizza is excellent. Had burger which was very good. They are in Madison Cocktail book which is a plus. Highlight on this visit was the service. Kudos to Seth and Kaitlin in that regard! Seth MCs and performs in a comedy show (I think on Wed nights). All in all had a great time.
."}
{"text":"I came here for Tuesday Trivia and had a great time (despite coming in last place).  They give prizes for first through third place and have about 15 teams competing.  They have popcorn you can grab a basket of while waiting for food.  Their drinks are a great price.  I got a hopalicious for $3.50.  Their patio is dog friendly and has the trivia questions broadcasted out there as well.  I definitely plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night, around 730pm. Service was quick and friendly. The cheese curds with ranch are to die for. I got the bacon blue cheese burger, and my boyfriend got the burger with an egg and bacon on it ( can't remember the name) and we both got ranch fries. Healthy? Not at all. But it was amazing. Easily in the top 5 burgers we'd ever had. All that was only $23.50. Quick dinner, cool atmosphere, ceap price.  They had an impressive bar an beer selection, but we were driving back to St Louis after we left so we didn't partake in anything.  I definitely recommend this place and will go back if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Wood fired pizza darn good.  Good beer options. Warm months hard to beat outdoor seating area.  Indoor layout is a bit odd not great.  Big improvement in TVs in the place.  Most of the staff is great.  Good lunch option too!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. The drinks are good and the buffalo chicken is great. New Year's Eve they had an all you can drink special was awesome. Both times I've seen a band here they've been great. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because the bartenders aren't the greatest. On a side note I was proposed to here so it's somewhere where we'll definitely stop in to once and awhile."}
{"text":"Really a pretty nice bar/restaurant. Comfortable couches and good pizza and burgers.  Good place to play trivia on Mondays. Makes me think there might be some good reasons to venture to the east side more often."}
{"text":"Good American fare with a fair Happy Hour. I used to work nearby and our team would come over here often. 

I have had the avocado and cream cheese burger (Keto friendly, so no brioche bun for moi!) I have also had a special sandwich, chicken salad on a croissant!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, and was pleasantly suprised.  The service was perfect!  The Salmon BLT was simply amazing and the Ranch fries dipped in Ranch was the topping on the cake!!

Highly recommended, and will go back again for sure."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for my 1 visit here. Service was a perfect 5 which outweighs the 4 stars on food quality. I had the Gyro which was by no means excellent but the texture of the gyro meat was very good thanks to some nice crunch and the pita was unique and quite tasty.  I got the ranch fries upgrade and they were so good that I didn't need to dip them in ranch and in fact, ate them with the loose spillings from the gyro, and that was amazing. Note that I added feta, which is a must on all but the best gyros."}
{"text":"My co-worker and i were sick of ordering Milio's every Friday so we decided to try Mr. Delivery. The Lazy oaf was one of the places close enough to us that would deliver. She ordered the Gyro and said it was good but needed a bit more sauce. I ordered the tenderloin melt and all i have to say is there was nothing tender about it. The chunks of meat were so tough i had to take them off of the bread to bite through them. After chewing, and chewing 2 of them i had to toss the rest. My break would have been over before i got through chewing the meat. I hear the pizza is good, maybe i will try that if there is a next time."}
{"text":"First thing I noticed upon entering were the comfy couches!! Jackpot!! The wait staff was very timely in seating us and the food came out pretty soon after ordering, didn't even have time to finish my drink. Very impressed!!!"}
{"text":"3 stars...
Searching Yelp for a local joint while traveling and this one caught my eye...
I started out with the cheese curds because I'm traveling in the cheesehead state?!? Unfortunately these were overcooked and a bit dark and tough.
For dinner I ordered the \"corn off the Cobb\" salad, and it was great! Barbecue chicken and roasted corn on a bed of mixed greens. Tomatoes, cheese, and avocado are just a few highlights to this dish that was very satisfying, and very large!
I was disappointed to learn they did not have a dessert to offer, so I went to bed with no dessert..
Prices are in line with expectation and ambiance is sporty spice sports bar. This joint doesn't make the list(I can't frequent a place without a dessert menu!!!) but I'll come back for that salad...it was fab!"}
{"text":"Really friendly service, the owner kept checking on me, as did hoth bar tenders and the bar back. Food was delicious, and really abive par for bar food. Not to busy or loud in the afternoons."}
{"text":"Lazy gyro. Not carved off a rotating hunk o meat on spit. This one is thin sliced lunch meat. I don't know how they cook it but mine was burnt"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is kinda dive bar-dark. Didn't have high expectations, but the service and food were ok. I ordered a salad with roasted corn and grilled chicken. I was really excited because roasted corn is my current obsession. Unfortunately, the corn didn't really seem roasted. It wasn't bad; just didn't live up to my high hopes. The chicken made up for that. It was generously flavored and presented well. 

We were having lunch there with friends we had not seen in 15 years. It was nice that the staff did not rush us as we reminisced."}
{"text":"My first visit to Lazy Oaf years ago when they first opened was a non-visit, as there was a tremendously rank odor that hit me as soon as I opened the door, and I turned and walked out. The memory of that kept me away from another visit until this past Thursday, when a friend was excited to attend an all-Harry Potter trivia night there. I approached cautiously...and was relieved to find the smell gone.

Trivia (hard to hear over the general loudness of the place) was fun for three of us who're Harry Potter fanatics, myself not being among them. So I just sampled the beer and appetizers. A nitro pale ale should be served very cold, but mine was not. Besides being 'cool' in temperature, it almost seemed flat. The fried pickles were good, tasted strongly of being fried in chicken fingers-flavored oil, which oddly wasn't terrible. The fries were weird, tasted mealy and damp on the inside.

Another non-Harry Potter knowledgeable friend commented that Lazy Oaf had catered her recent wedding, so maybe their catering is better than their bar food? She also told me their pizza is great, that they have a very state of the art pizza oven and the pizza chef is pretty much obsessed with his craft. So that's something I'll try when I visit again.

The service was very friendly and fairly efficient. The bathrooms are steamingly hot, does the air conditioning not have vents to those rooms? There is also a printed warning above the sinks that the water is hot enough to scald you so be careful. WTH? Fix your issues, guys.

I think Lazy Oaf has survived in this location longer than most, so they must be doing something right for a lot of folks. For this folk, it's just meh."}
{"text":"I love this place for the location and the food is good. However, I can't go to Lazy Oaf anymore for 1 reason: It smells awful. The inside smells like dirty dish water at all times of day, on all days. Please at least use lemon scent or something else that doesn't make your customers feel like they're sitting in a bucket of warm old bleach water. It is the most unappetizing thing and makes me feel sick. We tried to go there today and couldn't even sit outside because the garbage cans were lined up right by the door, in the sun, and it smelled like ... garbage rotting in the sun. It was awful. And since the inside smelled like it always does, we couldn't handle it and had to leave. Bummer! I hope Lazy Oaf reads this and makes some changes because I'd love to be able to go back. I've never experienced this with another restaurant so there must be \"solutions\" to the problem! Please try."}
{"text":"Salty, so-so food. Slightly scuzzy crowd. I called to ask about live shows on a Saturday and the bartender lady was so drunk she was slurring--she admitted it. Wow, that's embarrassing. Hire more professional staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to their Friday night fish fry and were not impressed. I had the baked cod, which was bland and low quality fish. My husband had the fried cod, which was burned and tasted awful. The fries were soggy, the soup was cold, and the sweet corn was mushy and tasteless. Their coleslaw was really good, but that wasn't enough to overcome the rest of the meal. Additionally, the acoustics were unpleasant. It's a cave like environment where sound echoes off all the walls and ceiling, making it obnoxiously loud. The best thing I can say is that the Friday night beer special is $3.50 pints of Spotted Cow. Go for that alone, if you can't think of anywhere better to go."}
{"text":"Sat on the porch on Tuesday night for trivia night and was packed-it was a good time!  Nice patio, decent prices on food and drinks, and the inside was nicer than I expected and was spacious.  I would come back here again for a meal and for trivia-the announcer guy was witty and hilarious....questions were a bit more challenging than I would have thought but we came in second so that's not too bad:)  You can tell they've had renovations recently but they forgot to work on the bathroom....hopefully that will come next."}
{"text":"Great beer.  I like to try different stuff.  The staff was also really friendly and tolerant.  I know the place is called The Lazy Oaf Lounge, but Hank took it to a whole new level.  He was literally lounging in the back of the room.  Each time he needed a refill on his drink, he just raised his glass and shook the ice in the empty glass.  He never said a word.  Just kept shaking that glass.  What a jerk.  I recommend the Lazy Oaf Lounge.  I do not recommend Hank."}
{"text":"I was not too impressed with the food, which is unusual, because I can typically always find something. Also, I heard they had some really good drink specials but when I got there they weren't as good as I had hoped (a dollar off drafts??)

The service though was excellent.  They only had three servers running from what I could tell, and the place was pretty packed for trivia night, so for them to be as efficient as they were was quite impressive.

I plan on returning in the future, so maybe I'll try something different and can give a better review of the food."}
{"text":"Only experience at the Lazy Oaf was during a Packers game and it was a lot of fun. Good crowd, servers were very nice and attentive despite the large crowd of people, and they have an awesome all-you-can-drink special on game day!"}
