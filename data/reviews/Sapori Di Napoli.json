{"text":"A warm inviting atmosphere. We've been over 15 times in the last year, everyone goes above and beyond to accommodate. Parking may be a little tight, however totally worth the wait. Prices are beyond reasonable, and food is nothing but delicious! A word of advise to all, the zeppolis are an absolute MUST! Anyone with anything negative to say about this fantastic restaurant should stick to upper class restaurants, this place is home away from home!"}
{"text":"We were a little unnerved when the gps claimed we had arrived. But as we turned the corner, we had indeed !  It is down a flight of stairs. Very welcoming. Homemade bread and a spicy antipasto of sorts to start. I had a mushroom garlic tomato and egg noodle dish. It was delicious!! Not too much pasta in it like you'd normally get at a chain Italian restaurant.  My husband was teasing me saying that the food better be good after having driven so far, and it was! I wish our neighbourhood had a restaurant like this within walking distance to our home. I hope the locals know how good they have it."}
{"text":"Very good gnocchi! The perfect balance between soft and firm - very hard to find!!! Don't let its location deter you - although it's in the basement of a triplex, the food is very good. Try the Arancini and the Gnocchi. It's hard to come by good gnocchi, and this one is one of the best I've tried."}
{"text":"Mamma Mia! I've been back three times and keep wanting more of the authentic italian dishes served at this rare pearl of an Institution. The homemade ricotta gnocchis are tight and tender, chewy and meld beautifully with the rich flavored tomato and basil sauce! As for the pies there are so many choices. My favorite so far is the pancetta and arugula pizza which is simply heavenly!   Located in the basement of a bordeaux cartierville residential complex, a few minutes by car from Marché Centrale, the recently opened Sapori Di Napoli is a worthwhile detour for any real Neapolitan cuisine fan. I will be back to try their famous lasagna!  Note: You can see pictures of many famous actors including actor Steve Schirripa, also known as Bobby Bacala Baccalieri from \"The Sopranos\", who enjoyed a couple of meals here while filming in Montreal."}
{"text":"The pizza here is second to none. Great home cooked Italian dishes in a very relaxed, neighbourhood style Resto. Did I say the pizza was amazing!!? Tried a few different pizzas, homemade gnocchi, pasta, salads and don't forget to ask for the spicy oil condiment that goes well on everything!"}
{"text":"Bon petit Resto ! Un 3.5 agréable et bon! Sans prétention ! Prix raisonnable! Calmars frits, pizza, crème brûlée!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good pizza. The dough is tasty, crispy and airy. The sauce is delicious too. The only thing I feel they can do better is with the cheese. Don't get me wrong, I love cheese too - but imo it was a bit too much for the pizza, a little less would make the ratio better. The toppings (well, topping in my case) were pretty abundant which was good as well.  The star was the focaccia that they give at the beginning with the chili oil. It was just delicious. I would go again, if I'm ever in the area, but would probably get the classic margherita (for the fior di latte instead)."}
{"text":"I really really really wish that I was Italian but I've come to terms with the fact that I am not -- and now that's okay because I can be as Italian as I want here and so can my taste buds. This verily is Italian food heaven. Welcome to the sweet, nutty and creamy Parmagiano Reggiano white, marinara red and pesto green coloured world that is the Elysian Fields of homey yet haute Napolitano cuisine in Montréal. Mangia, mangia, eat, eat, you're skin and bones ..."}
{"text":"Bro for real closes thing you'll get to a Sunday at nonna's. Except here you don't get spacciate when your not helping out in the kitchen. It's nice and quiet and you can relax and sit near beautiful artwork while you enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"Mon test ultime de la pizza: commander la plus simple (margherita), arriver à la manger en entier et pleurer de bonheur. En plus toute l'équipe est super sympathique!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Really delicious . The location is very odd, but once you find it you will not regret it. The bread they give you to start is amazing."}
{"text":"Quaint and quiet gem in the north end. Appears to cater to many regulars and after tasting their pizza it's easy to see why."}
{"text":"I decided to eat here for lunch with a friend during a weekday. We found it alarming walking in to see it empty of all clients besides us. Usually, that's a bad sign but I'm glad that my dining experience went completely against that bad sign.  Sapori Di Napoli, which is located in the basement of a building is a homely resto with spacious seating and a distinctive Italian decor that screams of the old country to you. The music is clearly Italian with a flavor of the napoletan and as someone who lived in Naples for 2 years as a teenager, a smile formed on my face.  Kindly note, as an Italian who's favorite resto is \"Casa Di Mama\" (Mom's Cooking!), I'm a very harsh critic of Italian food and service... so let's see how it went.   We decided to split an order of calamari and we both went with the tomato/basil gnocchi from the Yelp pictures already provided. The calamari was very good, with the right amount of chewy/crunch ratio to make it a classic dish. The gnocchi are made the old fashion way, the right way, with homemade pasta with homemade sauce. The gnocchi was good but I was a bit disappointed by them as they were smaller sized than I expected them to be and I didn't really taste the tomato/basil with a somewhat weak liquidy sauce. All in all, they were alright but I probably should have went with something else, like their Pizza.  For desert we both ordered a Cappuccino and a Tiramisu. The Cappuccino was decent enough but seemed to be off somehow. The Tiramisu simply wasn't for me. Perhaps it's the way my mom used to make it but I didn't like it at all. Too liquidy, flavor wasn't there.  The best part of our visit was our waiter Guido who was very friendly, accommodating, funny and amiable and took care of us. We got immediately served with the most delicious warm garlic focaccia bread that was simply phenomenal (and the best thing we ate!). I mentioned to my friend how I should bring my wife here as garlic focaccia is her kryptonite and would LOVE IT. At the end of our visit, Guido provided me with a huge bag with warm garlic focaccia to bring to the wife. WOW! During desert he provided us with free freshly made donuts as well. They were very good! I was blown away on his service. 5 STARS!  And the wife LOVED the garlic focaccia and we're now coming back... for good reason! I want to try their pizzas, arancini balls and those delicious donuts again! Once this is done, I'll update this review to the 5 stars I'm sure it deserves!!!  As for the resto being empty on week days, the problem is mostly location, I'm sure if the location was closer to the main streets of St. Laurent (it's located smack in the middle of very residential streets, so weekdays it's pretty quiet and weekends require reservations apparently) it would be otherwise full. With this type of food/service... no doubts about it.  Will come again."}
{"text":"In town on business travel and stumbuled across this pizza spot. I ordered the pizza napoletana and it was fantastic! I ordered the small pizza which was perfectly layered with mozzarella and anchovies. The distribution was great. The other items looked fantastic as well and I'll look forward to checking this place out again."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth bragging about. If you are looking for home made ricotta gnocchi then this is the place. With its homemade tomato sauce... Hmmm. The pizzas are Napoli style are really great!"}
{"text":"Always impeccable service & amazing food wish I could come more offer. The atmosphere is warm & inviting. Would recommend to everyone who has the chance to visit. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Came here on Valentine's day as I wanted to try a nice italian restaurant. At first, it seems like we we're entering a basement but once we got inside it was beautifully decorated. Great customer service and very nice waiter who made sure everything was to our liking. They served us garlic bread upon arrival. We ordered a lasagna and all-dressed pizza. Food was tasty. Reasonably priced. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came here for a family birthday party. We were a group of 10 that arrived st the same time and were greeted warmly and seated right away (oh yes you need reservations on a Saturday!)  Food and service were 5 Stars! Excellent all around. This restaurant is downstairs in a residential area so you might drive right by it. Street parking is available.   They lost a Star because they have (or had) the AC off and it was quite warm. Sorry friends! The food and service though were outstanding"}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews and seeing a youtube clip on Facebook of a comedy sketch by the owners son, I had to give it a try. It was late Wednesday night around 9:30 pm, restaurant was almost full which is always a good sign. We ordered an all dressed pizza and caesar salad. They started us off with a  spicy sauce and some bread, which was nice. Then brought us our order, the caesar salad had too many dark green roman leafs and the sauce wasn't that great. Then came the pizza, very oily, both the cheese and the dough. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad place but for me it did not live up to the hype. Maybe they were having a bad night. All I know is I Will be sticking to pizza Napoletana."}
{"text":"This place is one those great little finds.  Hidden away in the suburbs, this place will not let you down if you are looking for some good, hearty Italian food. Pizza is amazing and the pasta is no slouch.  Prices are great and the atmosphere is so laid back and relaxed, you wonder when Nona will come out in her slippers and ask if you enjoyed her sauce.  Don't be fooled by the looks of this place, it was a great recommendation I got because it so close to where I live.  I was quite impressed and have since been ordering delivery. This is a must try next time you want some really good Italian without paying through the nose or having to marry an Italian."}
{"text":"We came to eat here for the first time and the food was just incredible! Don't be fooled by the quiet neighborhood! This place is a jewel! We had arancini and salsiccia with rapini, delicious! The tomato sauce is incredible with the arancinis and the rapinis cooked and seasoned to perfection! We shared a pizza which was also delicious! The white pizza they give you as bread could have been my meal as it was also really delicious! We came out having eaten like kings! No room for dessert although I saw some tables having the home made donuts with Nutella and the cheesecake which also looked delicious! The espresso and cappuccinos are made barista style.   All in all, super authentic and friendly place! Would go back again everyday!"}
{"text":"La definition d'une véritable perle caché! Tout les plats son fait a la main, dans une ambiance tranquil. Toujours un service excellent. La nourriture est savoureuse, un must try pour les fans de plats Italien."}
{"text":"Omg this place totally surpassed my expectations!!  We were supposed to go to see the new avengers movie but it was crazy packed so we decided to go have supper instead. I yelped to see which restaurants were close by that had good reviews and I saw all the rave reviews on here. When I saw the restaurant I almost didn't want to go. It doesn't look like much and it's in a quiet residential area.  Boy am I glad I gave this place a shot! We didn't have any reservations and there was quite a few people in this restaurant. It has a homey feel and although it is an Italian resto it has a Greek feel to it with all the blue walls and decorations.   The focaccia bread that they give you to start is amazing! I would go back just for the bread! I don't even eat bread but that bread was the best bread of life!! After finishing the focaccia we had the fried calamari. It was good! It came with a spicy tomato sauce. I wish it had come with more sauce because it wasn't enough.   We felt very full after the calamari so we shared one pizza. We got the crudaiola. Toppings included tomato sauce, arugula, prosciutto, cherry tomatoes and mozzarella. The crust was thin and a bit soggy in the middle but still delicious. Portions are huge! I only ate a quarter of the pizza!   I will definitely be back! I can't wait for more focaccia bread!! Also we got a litre of house wine for approx $30 so we drank and ate like kings and it was very affordable!   My boyfriend and I went back on Friday and got two different pizzas and the same 1L bottle of wine. Of course we went to town on the focaccia bread again! It's a must have and it's free! I had the pancetta and funghi pizza which was so delicious! Definitely my fave out of the three pizzas that I tried here thus far. My boyfriend ordered the diavola pizza but it wasn't that great. First of all it was not spicy and the sausage was hard. We will definitely keep coming back and try their other pizzas."}
{"text":"Great upscale italian restaruant serving authentic italian pizza. Great service. Great ambiance. Delicious house wine. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Perfect Pizza! Love this spot. The pizza here is legit and the meatballs are insane. Really fun vibe here. Will for sure return. Ask for Guido he is the bomb.com!"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good there. I love there penne alla gigi. Wasn't impressed with there lasagna. Service is something they should work on, once fell on a waitress that was impatient and was talking very loud to another waiter and complaining about clients which was awkward. The owner and his son are very kind. They have a solid tasty pizza"}
