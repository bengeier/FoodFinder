{"text":"Whether you're visiting Scottsdale or a local resident, put Cafe Forte on your must-visit list.  The food is unbelievably delicious and healthy, and the staff and atmosphere are very pleasant as well.  If you're there on a Thursday night, you can enjoy live music and the art walk in Old Town.  Oh and try the horseradish salmon dish - it's to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Just strolled by and was hungry thought the atmosphere looked inviting and took and chance. I was not bummed about my choice. It was a perfectly light lunch an egg salad sandwich with a side salad and my husband enjoyed a buffalo burger. Food was great, amazing potato salad, service was great. It was a really nice sunny afternoon in scottsdale and this place was inviting on all levels. Dessert took it to a whole other level, the camelback i think they called it: decadent chocolate brownie with vanilla gelato and fudge and whip cream, sounds standard but it was anything but. Soooo good. definitely coming back for a fun sunny day lunch or a romantic dinner for two."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed lunch here twice since moving here from the Boston area. The service is great and the food is wonderful. The spinach salad had fresh greens and perfectly cooked bacon. I also enjoyed the turkey salad with the cranberry dressing on a previous visit. The meats are hormone and anti-biotic free and they try to serve organic veggies. Cafe Forte has a pleasant atmosphere tucked in between art galleries on Main St in Old Town Scottsdale. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Julie & I had lunch there & the food was super fresh..really cute place and they have a healthy happy hour."}
{"text":"The service here was very friendly and fast.  We ordered the brie appetizer, which was very good.  The salmon entree was a little fishy and overcooked. The spinach ravioli was just okay - the sauce was decent.  The sundae for dessert was good as well.   All in all, we had a decent meal, but we would have been happier if we didn't have to pay as much for the food. It isn't quite worth the price."}
{"text":"Was in from out of town and my friend suggested Cafe Forte.  We had the Brie for an appetizer and it was delicious.  For the main course we had the horseradish salmon and meatloaf.  Everything was perfectly done.  The mash potatoes were wonderful too.  For dessert we shared the bread pudding.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to eat a good meal in a small restaurant setting that  is quiet and inviting."}
{"text":"If you have not visited this wonderful, charming New York style cafe in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, then you haven't really been in Old Town!   This delightful cafe sits on Main Street surrounded by local galleries and a great small garden company. I have enjoyed several great meals there tried something new this past weekend and I must say,it was the most wonderful meal I have had in weeks. It was Sweet Potato Enchiladas, yum. It touched on every taste bud and after wards my mouth did not feel pasty, heavy  just light and well fed.   I love the music, the ambiance, the staff and it is priced well.........If you want a small intimate place to enjoy a fab meal, this is it.....bon appetite!!"}
{"text":"This is one of those amazing places that could easily be overlooked.  For more than 14 years, the owners of Cafe Forte have tirelessly made a name for themselves by providing unadulterated cuisine or comfort foods for folks who like their meals freshly made with only quality ingredients.   BRAND NEW Comfort Hours from 3-5pm features awesome appetizers like their roasted Polenta cakes!  They also feature $4 glasses of select wines and beers, too! One of their signature dishes is the Cafe Meatloaf with a light burgundy sauce and smashed potatoes.  They also feature many fresh seafood entrees as well as fine Italian specialties. Because the restaurant is located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale,  on Main Street, just east of Goldwater Blvd,  you can enjoy the works of fine artists as well as the fine foods at Cafe Forte. I recommend  beginning your meal with the baked brie and sliced apples along with a nice Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand. Casual atmosphere with little votives and a fresh flower on each table is what you will see when you first enter the main dining room.  There is a bar area and when weather permits, an intimate garden for romantic dining.  They also do amazing pies and tortes for dessert. Great for dinner on Thursday Artwalks or for a casual lunch with good friends!"}
{"text":"Stopped off for a snack at Cafe Forte while in the area.  Tables outside on sidewalk Parisian style.  We had baked brie in puff pastry on a bed of apples which was good at the time but I regretted later with the high fat content. Also had a plate of  lemony hummus dip which was good.  Large portions and good happy hour wine.  Very quiet for Main St on a Friday night.  We asked for a discount with our T cards but the waitress didn't know what these were despite having a sign for them in the window."}
{"text":"Café Forte is a complete delight!  I've had lunch and dinner here, and both experiences were great.  We don't have enough charming, inventive off the radar independent restaurants in the Valley that provide elegance and terrific food without fanfare or pretension.  This boite really adds to the pleasure of a day browsing the Main Street galleries, and really makes a guest feel important. So refreshing to get away from the carnival atmosphere of Olive and Ivy or the other large, high profile establishments in Old Town, and NO SPORTS TV's, hooray!   I loved everything about it, and will keep returning!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here with only 20 mins to spare before going to Escape the Room across the street. We thought there was no way they'd be able to accomodate a quick snack (appetizers) and drink but we were completely wrong.   Service was prompt and the hostess let our waiter, Neil, know immediately that we were in a rush. He took our orders for appetizers - confirming that the caprese salad, potstickers and sangria would be ready quickly and within our time constraints.   The restaurant delivered! The food was incredibly good and fast. Neil cashed us out quickly too. We were so grateful to get some good food in en expedient manner!"}
{"text":"There weren't so many good reviews on here but I really enjoyed the restaurant! The ambiance was beautiful, the service was great and the food was excellent! I'd highly recommend Café Forte."}
{"text":"This was very disappointing. I was there 03/22/2017 at 3:13pm, invoice #29. (This is for you Cafe Norte). I was sitting outside along main for about 15 minutes. two (2) couples were seated within 2 tables of me and received service. Nobody even talked to me.  Finally a waitress came out and asked \"Have you been helped?\" I said no, and another five minutes went by and I finally got service. The first two items ordered were not available so I ordered a cup of soup and a glass of Chilean Merlot I am familiar with. My wine came and it was spoiled, obviously improperly stored or old, approaching vinegar taste (but not vinegar). I worked in the wine biz for years and know wine. I asked for another glass from a fresh bottle and they refused. I was STUNNED!  My soup finally came out and it was 1/2 a cup. However it was OK.  The waitress (blond hair/middle age) very apologetic and stated the owner was coming out to talk to me, but never did.  I can not recommend Cafe Forte at 7032 Mains St. In Old Town Scottsdale. Please feel free to contact me for further information. And my photos and receipt.  By the way, they had no problem with handing me the bill after my noticing them of the bad wine and 1/2 cup of soup."}
{"text":"This is a small a gorgeous place. Fresh and organic food! I have now eaten both lunch an dinner here and enjoyed both! The sirlion was outstanding and let me tell you dont leave without trying Rosies Pie! Nothings better than homemade dessert,  the owners have a passion for food, and it shows. Service was also excellent, cant say we wont be back!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant that was stumbled upon.  Always seem to have a delicious Sangria on special.   Everything seems homemade and fresh.  Recommend the potstickers.  I would give it a try if you were in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for it."}
{"text":"My husband and I always make it a point to have a meal at Cafe Forte every time we are in the Scottsdale area.  We recently visited after spending time at the Waste Management Tournament and again we were not disappointed.  We love the atmosphere and the staff could not be any friendlier.  We always feel like regular's every time we visit.  The Cafe Caesar Salad is my go to while my husband loves the Romaine & Arugala Salad.  We also like to indulge in getting a side of their Cafe Meatballs as an appetizer. This time I had the Gorgonzola Crusted Sirloin Steak and it was cooked to perfection, combined with a great Cab picked out by one of the owners and my husband had the Cafe Meatloaf. It was a great meal and experience and cannot wait until my next visit to the Scottsdale Area. Thank you Cafe Forte"}
{"text":"Yummy food was awesome. Love  Neal and the owner Pat...I only wish they'd open a place like this in NYC."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Loved having a few glasses of wine and dessert! The staff is so friendly, great service.. The location is just too fabulous!! Perfect for a quiet dinner!!! Love it! Just come here!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for a while and I can't believe I'd forget about this local gem. Great Italian and continental cuisine.  Tasty appetizers and great entrees.  Always good daily specials,  including drinks.  Today was the white apricot mango sangria."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place in Scottsdale. Everything was fresh & delicious.  The menu has vegan, gluten free & vegetarian choices as well as many traditional dishes. Great food, loved the atmosphere (very comfortable, felt like home), nice wine list, great bread & awesome music! Their mantra is to enjoy life, one bite at a time. That is exactly what we did!"}
{"text":"Mmmm.....can someone get me some baked brie from Cafe Forte, like, right now?  I had the most delicious lunch at Cafe Forte, and I felt marvelous when I left. Full and happy and warm and fuzzy. :-)  We started with the Baked Brie: brie encased in a delicate pastry served golden brown with sliced apples. What about that doesn't sound delicious?  For my entree, I opted for the 1/2 sandwich and soup, and I could have had a gallon of the soup. It was an amazing chicken soup with a sweet/savory broth. Yum. I picked the egg salad sandwich, which was also quite good.  We decided to splurge and had dessert, the Bourbon Street Bread Pudding. So sweet and decadent - it was a lovely way to finish the meal.  When you're near Old Town Scottsdale, you MUST stop into Cafe Forte. Enjoy the warm and cozy ambiance and the delicious, homey food."}
{"text":"This place has always been a favorite of ours so we took our friends from Seattle. First of all the music was so loud we couldn't talk.  I had to ask 4, yes 4 times for them to turn it down. Finally we pleaded with the owner to please turn it down. The music was inappropriate we felt for the restaurant as well. The food was just ok, not great like it used to be. We probably won't go back. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town visiting and came across this place totally by chance late one evening having already eaten dinner.  The woman at the front door was so nice and inviting, we decided to come back for lunch a day or so later.  We are glad we did. My gachapo was delicious and the Greek Salad was also very good. We shared a Burrata for an appetizer (I confess to never tasting Burrata before) - it was really tasty.  My wife had an onion soup and really thought it was delicious, too.  We could not recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Cafe Forte is a gem not only in Old Town Scottsdale, but in the American Southwest. Everything is right about it--the food, the service, and the \"feel\" of the place.   My wife and I finished highly satisfying meals, concluded with Rosie's Mini Apple Pie with ice cream. It's the absolute best!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch with my dad while waiting for a nearby winery to open for tastings. It was a pleasant day so we sat on the patio, never went inside. They were not busy and service was good. Dad and I both got the lamb burger, due to my diet restrictions I ordered mine without the bun and substituted green salad for the potato salad with no problem. Everything was very good and the lamb burger was exceptional. I would recommend for a nice meal if in the area."}
{"text":"Sangria was refreshing.  Zin by the glass pretty good for the price. Nice place to stop by on a sunny afternoon. Patio seating was very nice."}
{"text":"Great little bistro for lunch and dinner, with white tablecloth ambiance, a few street-side tables, and friendly staff, set in the middle of Gallery Row on Main Street in Scottsdale.  Great emphasis on fresh ingredients without all the farm-to-table hype.  Crusty, fresh house-made French bread.  Fresh sangrias, and an excellent, diverse wine list.  We had chilled gazpacho, spinach ravioli, and the (cured) salmon platter, and everything was excellent.  The owners obviously care about providing exceptional-quality cuisine."}
{"text":"I am new to the area but I just happened to be walking down the street and stopped in to look at the menu and spoke to a delightful lady who bid me to give them a try I was looking for a Steak house! I was pleasantly surprised and had a delightful meal food and service was top-notch I had the salmon and would've given it five stars but I didn't care for there vegetable choice even though they were good :-) I will be back"}
{"text":"Me and my wife went here for valentines day with our two daughters, let's start off with our server \"Amanda\". In the beginning she was very friendly, well spoken thought she was very nice young lady. After she taken our order is like she forgotten we were there. She never came back to check on us, WORSE !! Server ever took a long time for everything. My word of advice is to avoid her, Food was good  just can't believe I paid 30 bucks for a tiny steak and 3 small portions of side. The owner needs to really focus more on new first time customers than cheat chating drinking her ass off."}
{"text":"Several years ago, I walked past this place and saw the menu outside advertising a Turkey club with crispy bacon. It is one of my favorite sandwiches. Fast forward to Friday afternoon when we sat down in this older restaurant with a skewed older crowd and I ordered that turkey club. If you could have seen my face when the $13 crappy as hell sandwich appeared, it would have been a sight for sore eyes.      Turkey Club - not a club, just a sandwich you can make at home. Store bought bread and cheese, one slice of lettuce and tomato and bacon and one slice of slightly better than average turkey (not house baked). It was served with kettle chips from a bag. This place might be the biggest ripoff in the area, but it appears that alot of older than age 60 people will keep it open. Ham sandwich - also miserable, just no soul and lousy sweet tasting potato salad.  If your younger than 60, please avoid this place or else you will feel ripped off for at least a day after your (lousy) meal. Trust me, you are willing to pay a few extra bucks for better food, but Forte does not deliver the results."}
{"text":"Ok, so we decided to give this place a try b/c Cafe Forte is rated #1 out of 651 restaurants on tripadvisor.  Honestly, I do not agree with their ranking....I mean come on...if this place is really #1, that means Scottsdale is filled with bunch of mediocre restaurants.   Maybe we expected too much...no....it just wasn't that good.      *Ambiance = very cute, relaxing, and clean. *Service = very slow.  The owner was a really nice and seated us promptly but the waitress...she is not a happy person. *Food = honestly, I just don't understand how this restaurant can be #1.... -Baked Brie = expected.  It was good but nothing extraordinary. -Gorgonzola crusted sirloin steak = not worth it.  It was descent.  However, if you are tempted to sprinkle salt on it, that means it's not that good.   If you want good steak, you should go somewhere else like Flemings.  Oh btw, the steak was tiny.   -Mahi Mahi Tuscano = I thought it was too salty...my bf thought it was ok."}
{"text":"I took my partner here for her birthday on Friday September 25th. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. Food however was horrible. We started out with sangria and a glass of wine both of which were great but it was downhill from there. Appetizer of potstickers that were from a freezer bag that you can get at Costco, 10 bucks for 4 and they were disgusting. My main course was pecan crusted chicken and the chicken was very dry the vegetables that came with it were mushy and there was not nearly enough sauce. My partner got the sweet potato enchilada and it was not good at all. On their website they advertise little mini apple pies that are supposed to be to die for, mine tasted like it was baked about a week ago it was very dry and bland, to be honest with you I would have rather eaten a hostess apple pie and we all know how gross those are. We also got a bread pudding which I would give a 7 out of 10 so it was pretty decent but that was compared to everything else that we had tried. I really can't say how disappointed we where and we will never be going back. This seems to be the trend and when your meal is over $100 for two people, it should be at least satisfy. You shouldn't be leaving the place you had dinner pissed off and feeling resentful that you spent so much money on a very disappointing meal. Makes it hard to support non chain establishments when you consistently get food like this."}
{"text":"Five-stars hands down. This place has been at this same location for nineteen years! Wow! I didn't know! What a hidden gem! They served me the best meatloaf plate since I left the south. The staff were mainly family or adopted into the family. One of the owners stood at our table and answered all of our questions regarding the restaurant's menu, hours, history, future, etc. They really made us feel welcomed! We will definitely show our patronage again and again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with unparalleled ambiance! Do yourself a favor and request a table on the side-walk... after a few minutes you're a short walk from the hustle and bustle of downtown Scottsdale and instead find yourself in a quiet, almost European terrace. The perfect place for great food and the atmosphere seems to elicit quality and engaging conversations. Their Hibiscus margarita was a delightful drink special and the main courses were delicious. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for relaxed yet fine dining.... a piece of Paris in the middle of Arizona!"}
{"text":"Dorothy and I are doin' salmon for Mother's Day Brunch in Old Town Scottsdale...QUITE  FABULOUS."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience here at Cafe Forte. Even though it was a little busy for Valentine's Day, the staff was wonderful and accommodating and the food delicious and flavorful. I had the Pecan crusted chicken and my date had the Bloody Mary penne pasta. We both loved our dishes and enjoyed the view from our patio seating. This is a great little romantic spot off of Main St in Scottsdale that is nestled between all the art galleries. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent salads, great place for lunch while in Old Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Cafe Forte is usually closed on Sundays, but I was able to go for their special Mother's Day menu. My mom chose the restaurant based on a strong recommendation from a friend and I was very pleased. The location is convenient in old town Scottsdale, and the restaurant is very cute. Reminds me of a Tuscan theme with faux finished wall, etc.  We started our meal with the baked brie and apples based solely on Yelp reviews. It was delicious and had a subtle, yet rich flavor. I opted for the house meatloaf, my stepdad chose the lamb burger, and my mother picked the pecan crusted chicken breast.  House Meatloaf -- The meatloaf was rich and tender with the right amount of sauce (sometimes it's too thick or heavy). I also liked the mashed potatoes that came with the meal, but found the mixed veggies to be lackluster. They're the same mixed veggies you can get in a frozen bag, so that was the weakest portion of the meal. If they swapped out the veggies this would be solid! I thought the price point was too high for the meal for the veggies to be such a low quality.  Lamb Burger -- My stepdad found the lamb burger (medium) to be delicious and opted to get the potato salad that comes with it. He thought both were great and strongly recommended ordering this.   Pecan Crusted Chicken Breast -- I had a bite of this and it was SO GOOD. I'm not the biggest fan of chicken breast at restaurants, but this was delicious. The pecan crust was substantial and evenly coated over the entire chicken breast. This is the perfect choice for someone who has a sweet tooth. It's also worth noting how JUICY the chicken breast was. Very good. The only downside, again, were the wimpy veggies. I seriously can't believe they opted to plate this delectable meal with bagged veggies you can get in the freezer aisle. That was a shock and disappointing.   For desert we ordered the Raspberry Basil Pie (which was on special) and the mini apple pie. Both were served with ice cream. I was hesitant to try the raspberry basil pie, but it was DELICIOUS!!! Seriously, you should give it a try. The mini apply pie was good, but the rich flavor of the raspberry basil pie was the winner for me. The restaurant also accepts pie orders, but with 24 hour notice. I would definitely return here to order a pie for special occasions.  The service was warm, patient and attentive. My mother received quite a few \"happy mother's day\" compliments from the staff and owners and she had a treat. The only downside for me were the choice of veggies on the plate. If they improved on the quality and portion size of the veggies this would easily be 5 stars. Right now the price point for the entrees don't make the quality of the sides included with the main meal.  With that said, I would highly recommend trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my mom. Loved it. Organic. Excellent service. Great atmosphere for casual or business conversation."}
{"text":"There are few places I'll rate 5 stars and even fewer I will travel across state lines to eat but Cafe Forte is one of them.   First the food: quite literally the best meal I've ever eaten out. I has the meatloaf and it was out of this world. Like...I doubt I'll ever eat meatloaf anywhere else; sorry grams. My girl had the Horseradish Salmon so I got a bite or five and it was excellent; I don't even like salmon. Dessert was A perfect ending. Had pumpkin pie which was tasty but pretty standard. The chocolate tart blew my brains out; I almost cried when it was all gone.   The service: Neal was the man. Ask for him of you come through, you won't be disappointed. He was quick, knowledgeable, funny and engaging without being overwhelming. Pacing of dinner was excellent. I was never rushed and never waiting.   Perfect location right in the middle of the art district for a lovely date. The four owners Syd, Grace, Rosemary and Pat are great hosts and make the place that much more love able.   By and far one of my favorite places to eat in Arizona. Don't miss out."}
{"text":"A coworker and I ate lunch here today and had a great experience!  The atmosphere is great...comfortable and welcoming.  The staff was very friendly too.  We both enjoyed the quiche special with a side salad and it was delicious...we both finished our plates!  There were many great options on the menu, so I'll have to come back again!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I wonder how a restaurant gets a great location, yet manages to stay open amidst the culinary delight that surrounds it. Downtown Scottsdale is a hotbed of food delight, to keep a good eatery open in the area would require something special, something awesome or at the very least... something.  I will start off by saying that maybe this review isn't fair, I did only have an appetizer... *takes rating from one star to 2...* and a glass of wine. But to me, first impressions are everything, and Cafe Forte failed me at hello. Not the server mind you, she was pleasant and attentive.   They call themselves a Bistro & Wine Bar... again... wine in the title, you had better have an awesome selection of wine. That was the hello that lost me.  Needless to say, the wine list left me flat... I had to settle with a Cab from Washington that was warm and disappointing. I know, they didn't make the wine, but they make the choice of what they serve by the glass, and at what temperature to serve it. There is an amazing amount of wineries out there that are producing some fantastic vino, and some of those are local Arizona wine makers that make a terrific glass of wine.   This isn't about supporting local growers (though, it's a good idea.), this is about choice. Call yourself a wine bar, then act like one. Give us a choice.  We had the hummus appetizer. It came out looking like some strange beetle had died on it's back... presentation was a bit strange, I thought my 9 year old niece was in the kitchen making food art... it was supposed to have hint of lemon, I am pretty sure they used Pledge to get the flavor...  ...Y'know... this is unfair. I will stop here. Everyone deserves a second chance. I am sticking to my guns with the 2 stars for now. I truly believe that with competition in the area, you need to step up your game, and Cafe Forte seems to be on the bench at the moment."}
{"text":"Truly outstanding food. Possibly the best in the valley. Creative as well as tasty. On top of all that, it is reasonably priced. Great wine selections and nice ambiance. It is also appropriate for vegetarians and even vegans.  My only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that last time I was there, the music was too loud for a pleasant dinner and was a bit like dance music at times. But this is an easy fix and I hope the owners do as it is such amazing food.  I will definitely go back and will update people on the music."}
{"text":"Great lunch and dinner spot in the art district of old town Scottsdale. We had the turkey club which had carved turkey, 2 slices of provolone, bacon, tomato, etc on sourdough. Also the egg salad sandwich which also had lettuce and tomato on sourdough. The egg salad was not too heavy and the red potato salad was amazing. I probably could've eaten a whole plate of just the potato salad. The restaurant is very quaint, has some eclectic music playing as I'm pretty sure I heard a jazz song, French language song, and Lady Gaga song while we were there. I may try out sitting on the patio next time as there was a musician playing across the street. Overall I would definitely go back, I want to try some of the homemade desserts next time."}
{"text":"Short Story  Bland  Bland Unappetizing Painfully Slow Not being checked on Loud Old Music Blaring   Longer Story  I received a watery funky unknown flavor of iced tea and I knew things would decline. The dining room was very loud with music but it was mostly but not all sounds of the forty's I suspect. The restaurant didn't seem busy as it only had a few tables seated but it might have taken about a half hour to prepare a salad and the sandwich we ordered and another half hour for the server to return.  I receive my salad and the greens were fresh and good and I will go on to say the blue cheese tasted like a good blue cheese. The turkey however was very dry chalky white meat that lacked flavor and the house made concoction of cranberry relish was something I didn't relish . It was lumpy thick and creamy and was hard to identify a taste because it was not good to me. I could not eat it. So I ate very dry flavorless turkey on wet plain greens and the only flavoring I got was from the blue cheese. Our server was walking around like in slow motion and never made it over to check on us.  My husband tasted my dish and just like last week he said, \"WOW that's Bad! Then he tried his dish. He also had a plain green salad without dressing. He said the ciabatta bread was good but his sandwich was tasteless. I tried a tiny bite of the chicken. It was cooked nice but was oddly tasteless. I wouldn't say his plate was awful it just wasn't tasty.  We finished and waited for a LONG TIME for our server to give us the check.  My review is based on just one lunch visit.  2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Relaxing, delicious lunch!  Sangria is refreshing  the service is outstanding and our meal was delicious and definitely crafted with fresh ingredients.  You must experience the cozy atmosphere of Cafe Forte. I will!"}
{"text":"Very good experience here. Great food, service and setting.   Food was fresh and prepared excellent. Sangria was a nice compliment to lunch."}
{"text":"Met the owners, chatted and sat down. Beautiful ambience, great menu, not too many items. Excellent smoked salmon plate, great quiche and egg salad to die for. Give this bistro a try, talk with the ladies that own it- they care about what they do and it shows."}
{"text":"Everything here is just OK. I've definitely had better and I would most likely choose another restaurant in the future, but nothing was extremely bad about this place...just ok. The atmosphere is a little stagnant and while seating inside the restaurant is extensive, it didn't feel very welcoming and it was too beautiful of a day to sit inside anyway. We sat outside and it reminded me of sitting on a friend's apartment patio. The tables were tiny and a little rickety and we ended up moving from one because it was uneven. The food itself was also just ok, but way more expensive then it needed to be. I went with a salad with brie and apples. It cost an additional $4 to add chicken which I did. The salad was decent and tasted like something that could be made at home. Nothing stood out in my book during my visit, but nothing was awful either."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere with good food.  Located among the numerous art dealers in the area."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to this place over the past year but the food was horrible!   We went for their New Years Eve menu which sounded old school but fun.. the food was horribly dreadful. 4 courses for $59, well in this case you most certainly did not get what you pay for.  Starting with the salad.. it under dressed and under seasoned, beef Wellington was abysmal, under seasoned and undercooked. Stuffed chicken was dry and tough and all plates came with a few pieces of carrot and broccoli, probably from a bag. The bright spot was the sausage and pepper appetizer, which was actually really tasty but the 2 bites left me feeling like Oliver Twist!   Then the desserts.. uhg.. the desserts could have come from a box from Costco, not horrible but ordinary and boring.   The service was still excellent but the food was just uninspired and poorly executed.   I used to love this place and it saddens be to say such things but I have to let you know, they need an infusion of something.. perhaps life?"}
{"text":"Cafe Forte is the perfect complement to the ambiance of Old Town Scottsdale. Main Street in Scottsdale is a sensory experience. Cafe Forte provides a burst of fresh and healthy flavors for the taste buds. The attention to detail in the sourcing of their ingredients is obvious. The artistic presentation of each course is masterful. The carefully selected music and the original art on the walls is consistent with the experience of the art district in Scottsdale. Ladies lunch or romantic dinner, this restaurant inspires return visits."}
{"text":"Don't order from them... they don't know how to take care of a customer or take responsibility for their failures."}
{"text":"Peg and I found out about this place years ago...during an art walk....and loved it. As things sometime happen, patterns change and we hadn't been back in much too long a time...until last night.  OMG!  This is still one of the best independently-owned restaurants in the Valley. Wonderfully vibrant gazpacho, pot stickers, horseradish encrusted salmon, a VERY juicy and not oh-my-gawd-meatloaf-again? meatloaf with mashed Yukon golds and corn.  The chocolate truffle tart was amazing and just right for sharing.  Rose was outstanding and guided us through the journey.  This place is definitely going to be revisited sooner than later....and I would highly recommend it.  Dr. B"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Cafe Forte with my wife and it was an amazing experience. Cozy atmosphere, calming oldie goldie music, excellent service and lovely food. If you want a quiet evening with simple but delicious food, this place would deliver it."}
{"text":"Four stars for food.  One star for service. Everything we ate was excellent.  Salads were nicely dressed.  White sangria was delicious with its mango base.  Prices were good. We waited at least 15 minutes for water and a menu.  Another 15 to order.  We had to wave the waiter down to get silverware, bread, order a second glass of wine, order desert. Good wait staff scans the room to see if anyone is trying to get their attention. These waiters were oblivious. Food might bring me back but not when I'm antsy to get to the Art Walk."}
{"text":"We ate at Café Forte with two other couples on a Wednesday night. Hardly anyone in the restaurant at 7 pm should have been our first clue. The serve was ok. The caprese salad was very salty. The Special, mushroom ravioli was served warm not hot and really had no taste. No one else at the table said they enjoyed the meal. There are better restaurants in old town Scottsdale, go there."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! We were here a bit after close and they still made us feel welcome. They didn't rush us out of the door and even still brought dessert menus. Food was yummy and not too expensive considering the area. Will return. :)"}
{"text":"I've had some wonderful dishes at Cafe Forte - my favorite is the mushroom ravioli which is only made on Thursday - - if you need me and it's a Thursday you'll know where to find me!"}
{"text":"Delicious as expected! Horseradish Salmon with mashed and veggies and fresh peach pie. If you don't visit this location you are missing out!  The food is fresh and fantastic-it's a must for me every time I come to Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and staff.  This mordern Euro Bistro offers a nice mixture of classic food.  The Lasagna was what had and i was very impressed.  The aroma from this classic dish took me back to my days as a child where my mom would start her prep for dinner early in the day a we would have the smell of lasagna and marinara swarming through the house.   the Maple encrusted chicken was a little sweet for my dates taste but still nice.  Wine list was limited but has some excellent choices ranging from a varietals as  Sangoviese to Savigion Blancs from New Zealand.  Highly recommended this place for a quiet day"}
{"text":"Beautiful, relaxed, \"grown-up\" ambience. Warm, welcoming, knowledgeable service staff. I had the smoked salmon plate for lunch (Yum!), along with a nice glass of recommended white wine. Perfection."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in old town. Couldn't believe they've been around for 21 years!  Food was excellent, gf got a white wine that was good. I got an old fashion which was REALLY good.   Service was also very good. Wasn't over the top, he was prompt to take care of us, but also gave us ample amount of time to enjoy our drinks and food.   I don't really go out of my way to write Yelp reviews but this place definitely stood out. Seems family run, could be wrong, but I always appreciate that kind of stuff."}
{"text":"Out of two appetisers and four main courses, I would say one was a \"Wow\" and the rest were all, as another reviewer has said, \"just OK\", at best.  One of the appetisers, the hummous, was not good at all, being a bit bitter and very grainy.  It needed lemon and salt.  The penne with Italian sausage consisted of boiled-from-the-box penne, what appeared to be a sauce of canned tomatoes, and a very modest amount of decent grilled sausage.  I ate it, but I didn't really enjoy it.  Only the spinach and cheese ravioli was restaurant quality.  The decor is acceptable -- Cafe Forte is a small place in the extended strip mall of Main Street in Scottsdale.  The service was friendly but a little slow (1 hour 20 minutes for appetisers and main courses) in a half-full restaurant.  The prices were mixed -- the pasta entrees were around $12-$15, the appetisers around $10.  I am not unhappy to have gone here, but I can't recommend Cafe Forte either."}
{"text":"This is an awesome restaurant in Downtown Scottsdale.  Absolutely great homemade food!  Find it; try it!  You won't regret it!  KA"}
{"text":"We had a delicious dinner and special occasion setting for New Year's Eve-- dinner for two.  The service and food were both extraordinary.  It's a small, romantic spot for a special meal.  We plan to try it again soon for a date night out from the regular menu.  The ingredients were especially fresh and well prepared, no heavy handed sauces here, and that was a delight.  The owners are on hand to greet you and make sure your evening is a special one.  Nice touch and within walking distance of all of Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great family owned cafe on Main Street. Sid and Pat are super nice and always remember me when I call in my orders. Some truly great food I have had at Cafe Forte include the baked Brie in pastry, their baked chicken dinner, egg salad sandwich, chicken salad sandwich, the village salad, and an assortment of amazing soups!  This is a great place but it's especially great because it is a unique business, locally owned, and you can feel the love in their food."}
{"text":"Tried 4 things.... all troublesome.   The spinach ravioli... from Costco!! You know the ones that come in a huge bag with the packet of cheese and herbs? I actually like those ravioli, but Cafe Forte served them in a bath of water and some of the cheese and herb packet. So gross... Chicken salad sandwich: Not a fan of the chicken salad. Had a mustard taste and had too much mayo. Not a disaster, but I couldn't eat most of it because it just had an odd taste. Chocolate truffle cake: Half baked brownie batter on a obviously pre-made white crust. I found it odd to serve a chocolate cake on a white crust... Carrot cake: Dry, probably store bought...  Never again....."}
{"text":"Stopped by this little treasure while waiting for friends. I had the daily special: Salmon Burger with a side of greens and my companion had the Cuban sandwich (Copa Cubano or something similar) I've never had a cuban sandwich before...it was absolutely divine.  The ambience was stellar and perfect for a weekend brunch, service was prompt and polite, the food was incredibly tasty.   I really appreciate being able to have food that's not gross, greasy and deep fried, so this place is a 100% win as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"I have been to Cafe Forte many times and I really love the food- especially the lunch menu.  I've tried about 6 or 7 of their lunch offerings and they were all very good meals.  The daily quiche special is my favorite thing to get, but truly you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.  Its an excellent place to grab lunch if you're out and about in Old Town."}
{"text":"My wife and I are in town for spring training. We had dinner at Cafe Forte on Saturday evening March 11. We selected Cafe Forte based on Yelp and Trip Advisor reviews and our personal preferences. Wow!  What a find! This cafe met all of our high expectations for service, ambiance, food preparation, quality, and price vs value. We both had the vegan split pea soup special and the breast of chicken. My wife enjoyed the sangria and I a California merlot. We had an excellent dining experience and we definitely will return next year."}
{"text":"Very good, reasonably priced Champagne. The presentation of each dish is spectacular. The baked brie was positively one of the most amazing appetizers I have ever eaten.  The spinach ravioli was cooked perfectly with nice firm pasta. It was a little bit on the watery side but still very good. The cheeseburger was cooked perfectly. Dessert decadent. The service was very professional. I really felt like the staff was happy to have you there. I seldom give five stars but I just can't fault it!  I will return."}
{"text":"Café Forte is a delightful treat and not to be missed in Old Scottsdale!!!  There is a reason why they have been open since 1996  -- 21 years, you know they are doing something RIGHT!!!    You will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED with the quality of food, service and ambience.  Syd is one of the owners and she is very attentive to her customers and ensures the quality of food is TOP notch and IT IS!  Sydney is one of the servers and she is also fantastic, very prompt and knowledgeable.  We travel frequently to Europe and throughly enjoy dining and wine.  Approximately, a few months ago we stopped in for lunch for our first time, prior to our trip to Italy and enjoyed a nice bottle of Tuscan wine that was properly stored.   We have been back several times since and the consistency is impeccable.    Terrific Menu that is executed superbly, KUDOS to the chef!  I enjoyed their soup du jour a few times with crusty ciabatta bread and it was delicious with fresh ingredients that shine!  Try out their Cafe Cubano that my husband absolutely loved!  Once you go here YOU will find a new favorite restaurant in Scottsdale!  I am thankful we have added Café Forte to our list of places to DINE!  TIP: Wednesdays lunch and dinner for Summer are offering 1/2 price off bottled wine / any bottle!  Terrific!"}
{"text":"Dinner before the Scottsdale Artwalk. Gazpacho great, my salmon was delicious, as was the gals meatloaf covered with caramelized onions. Cappuccino to finish the dinner. Friendly server, staff even photo bombed us on request (for fun). Always excellent!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice quiet atmosphere for lunch, suitable for groups. The food wasn't particularly memorable except for the dessert menu, which was divine. The service was very prompt and attentive. All in all this is a nice place that won't throw you any unpleasant surprises. We went in the afternoon when it was quiet, but it might be busier at dinner. I'd be willing to try it for a dinner date."}
{"text":"Lovely neighborhood cafe.  The owners and staff are friendly and attentive.  The food is fantastic..love the baked Brie Ruth coffee!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife's new favorite. The turkey club was perfect and the red potato salad was also top notch. Great spot in the heart of old town Scottsdale. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Wow what a great lunch place! Great service and atmosphere and really yummy healthy food! I had an apricot sangria that was so delightful and thirst quenching in this Arizona heat along with a healthy buffalo burger that was so tasty. I definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone. I can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  I enjoyed my sashimi salad a lot (just wish there had been more greens) and the bread and butter they serve was delicious.  Service was pretty laid back, and by that I mean slow.  But I didn't really mind as I was not in a hurry.  If you are in a hurry, I would steer clear or at least make sure your server knows.  The crowd here was definitely older and it's got a quiet atmosphere.  Not the type of place to bring rambunctious children!  So if you're looking for a sophisticated spot to relax with other mature adults, this place might serve you well!"}
{"text":"Lovely friendly restaurant - great lunchtime sandwiches and excellent evening menu. Pecan crusted chicken was moist and flavorsome as was the salmon. Deserts scrumptious!"}
{"text":"We only ordered one appetizer, otherwise I'd probably have given two stars, but felt like I should be fair having only tried this one item. The white bean appetizer dip really wasn't very good. It tasted like something you could buy at the grocery store and bring home. The pita bread was dull store bought frozen, just heated.    The wine list is a joke. I don't understand how these places call themselves a \"wine bar\" in listings, and get there to see such limited selections. We went on a Thursday night during Art walk and the place was totally dead, while all the other restaurants were busy. That should have told us something right away. There are definitely better places in the area.   The other problem I had was with the overall vibe. I felt like I was in a nursing home. Everyone was geriatric practically, and the music seemed to cater to that crowd as well. I'm not sure what they're trying to be, it's sort of confusing (the vibe) but I didn't feel like coming back. Oh, and it was pretty pricey for what you get as well."}
{"text":"Went here on the advice of a friend and glad I did.  Cute little restaurant in the heart of old town Scottsdale.  Excellent waiter who gave us the skinny on what to order.  I had the soup and half sandwich combo with homemade egg salad and onion parmesan soup and it was awesome!!  I will be back soon! My friend enjoyed the peach Sangria which was homemade also. The frozen chocolate truffle dessert is to die for!"}
{"text":"This place was completely cute and the service was great.  However, neither my husband or I were really that impressed with the food.  We started with the baked brie as an appetizer.  It had a very strong ammonia smell that was a huge turnoff.  I know that sometimes happens with brie so we ate it anyway but a couple of hours later with both got bad stomach aches.  I later googled it and it seems the ammonia smell comes out more when the cheese is past its prime.  There is no way to know for sure if we actually got sick from the brie or not but I have to subtract a couple stars for that.  Our main dishes were ok; he got the spaghetti with meatballs and I got the bloody mary pasta.  His dish was very simple but he liked it and I was impressed that he ate it at all b/c he normally prefers beef or lamb meatballs to ground turkey.  I enjoyed my dish as well but it was not as good as I thought it would be based on the description.  It really did taste like a bloody mary, complete with fresh celery leaves but it was not as spicy as I was hoping for.  I would probably give them another chance if someone else suggested it. But I would likely pick somewhere else since there are so many other great restaurants in the area.  I definitely will not order the baked brie there again!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic family-owned restaurant! The place is so cute and the food was delicious."}
