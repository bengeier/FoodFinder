{"text":"The reasons I choose this place over Chipotle: Wheat Tortilla, Brown Rice option, pesto cilantro sauce, no charge for guacamole on items. I go here probably 2 times a week lately because it is a good option for a healthy meal. I usually get the salad with brown rice, black beans, chicken, pesto sauce and salsa. I also like the option for a wheat tortilla. Guacamole is fresh and has always been good. Great food, great healthy options, good service."}
{"text":"I have gone to several locations without my physical rewards card, and the employees have printed out receipts w/a claim code for me to use at home to get the points. HOWEVER, this location had rude confused employees that have never learned how to do the same and acted as though I didn't know what I was talking about. To the owner/manager, please keep your employees up to date with how other locations function. What an absolute annoying experience!! I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"This place is great for on the go meals, even perfect if you're trying to watch your weight. The employees are fast, place is clean, and the price is reasonable. You also have the choice whether you like brown rice or white rice and flour tortilla or whole wheat. The only thing I would suggest is if they could add wifi. I like studying here if I don't need internet but that's just me. Overall, two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Good, fast Mexi-American food at a reasonable price.  As other reviewers have pointed out, Zabas is similar in menu to Chipotle, but with more protein options. You pick you meal (burrito, quesadillas, salads...), your protein, your preferred salsa, and your add-ons. I had a pulled steak quesadilla. It was basic, and a bit too greasy for my tastes, but the meat was both good and plentiful.   Located by the Kohl's and Petsmart in the NW corner of the city, it's not a place I would go to specifically, but it is the best of the food options in the area."}
{"text":"If you eat here bring cash! My account was double charged three times in one day. We were told this was a bank glitch however the people we talked to today  said this has been happening to people since November!  Initially we spoke with Zabas last week and are still waiting for a resolution.  We even offered to accept store credit but they refused as it's a bank issue."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp tacos. It was really good. Clean atmosphere. Set up like Chipotle so you can pick whatever you want. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I really like their fish tacos. I always order the fish tacos but this past week I ordered a burrito, OMGosh it was huge!! My son always gets the burrito so I had to try it! It was big enough for two people! I really loved it and the prices are affordable.  For the 3 of us the cost was $24.  Two big huge burrito's one fish taco, 2 bags of chips!"}
{"text":"I have frequented some of the other Zabas locations in town, and I was excited when this new location at the Plaza Hotel opened up since it is close to where I work.    I went there for lunch and was happy to see that the ordering process, menu, and prices were about the same as the other locations. The staff was fast and friendly. Although after ordering my chicken burrito bowl things got odd.   The first issue I encountered was that they didn't have any fountain drinks, only bottled Pepsi products that cost about $2.50 per bottle. You can go over to one of the neighboring fast food places to get a fountain drink if you want.  With the overpriced bottle of soda, the price of my lunch went up to over $11.   Then the only seating available are some tipsy and uncomfortable tables and chairs about 50 feet away from the restaurant. While I was sitting there a homeless looking person walks up to my table with a cardboard sign saying that he is stranded and needs money and just stands there about 2 feet away from me and my food waiting for me to give him money.     Encountering these folks outside the casinos in downtown Las Vegas is pretty commonplace, but inside the Plaza Casino? This person went to the other tables in the area and did the same thing.  The person finally left on his own and I didn't see any security come through.    I got a very sketchy vibe from that whole experience which will probably prevent me from going back to this particular Zabas or any other restaurant in the Plaza for that matter. It is a shame, I was really looking forward to this place opening.  Although I still give this Zabas three stars for the food being good. But the Plaza really needs to clean up its act."}
{"text":"Thank goodness one of my husbands clients told us about this place!!   No more Chipolte EVER..lol..  Zaba's meat is more fresh & white meat chicken..  They offer brown & white rice.  Also wheat tort or white flour tortilla.  And don't forget the yuuuummmy queso sauce they have! You can add to any burrito, salad.. etc.   They also sell nachos you can deck out like your salad or burrito :)"}
{"text":"Build your own burrito place. Also has tacos, salads, rolled tacos and fish tacos. Serves beer and margaritas. Kids eat free on Sundays. Just opened and has a nice indoor and outdoor sitting areas."}
{"text":"I like their skillets for breakfast. The biscuits and gravy is good. I actually didn't like their fish tacos. They're lacking in flavor and the tortillas have a weird texture. They fall apart too easily and they're too mealy? I don't know exactly how to describe it. Service is good. The place is nice, not too spacious though."}
{"text":"Love the fish tacos! My boyfriend won't eat any fish but these, they're that good. The steak tacos are also good & the burritos are huge. I find this way more relaxed than cafe rio or chipotle and the ingredients are really fresh."}
{"text":"Love the restaurant has great food and the prices are reasonable great service. Everyone in the family has something good to eat and loves it to. I love to be able to see them make the food in front of me and see everything they add to it so it is the way I like it."}
{"text":"If you ever want to feel uncomfortable and awkward about your eating choices then be sure to visit Zabas. The staff does a wonderful job of talking about you and laughing in Spanish behind the counter the entire time your ordering. Never felt so uncomfortable in my life in any food establishment. One staff member went as far as counting with her fingers how many lemons I took for my daughter (who loves lemon juice on her rice). Absolutely despicable. I dealt with this behavior quietly for over a year and said nothing, now I will never return to this establishment. The owner should be appalled to allow such staff to work here and treat guests this way."}
{"text":"I'll make this a quick one. After a long and fun night on Fremont Street I had to have some chow before bed. Zapas is in The Plaza and we're staying here so my options were some what limited.  I jumped in the line and ordered a chicken rice and cheese burrito and an order of taquitos.  I was not disappointed. The ordering process is similar to a Chipotle or Subway. You pick your ingredients as your going through the line.  The food was ready fast and the staff was friendly and willing to answer questions about the different sauces and ingredients. The price was on par with the location and food. Give it a shot"}
{"text":"With the exception of the one time I found a rock in my food...Zaba's hasn't let me down! It's a quick, easy & relatively healthy spot close to home. I go for the Zabas Bowl every time."}
{"text":"Excellent food. My first time being  here. Not too busy. Manager was working the registers,  doing a great job."}
{"text":"The tacos here are pretty delicious. I've had the grilled chicken and the shredded beef, every time I've been here, both were good and tender but very under-salted. They have little salt packets in the checkout area, so you can just add salt-- not too big of a deal. Besides salt, the seasoning is pretty tasty on both meats. I've had the street tacos, crunchy tacos and the nachos. My boyfriend had the beef taquitos; they were small but he thought they were good. The street tacos are tasty, the tortillas are soft and pliable but they didn't fall apart from the filling, although they could have been grilled a bit longer. They weren't the best traditional tacos I've ever had but they weren't terrible either. The crunchy tacos are really, really good. They're nice and crispy and the shell is actually very tasty. The nachos are equally awesome. They don't give much meat so I usually add extra and then it's perfect. The queso is tasty and so are the toppings you can add. The lettuce is always fresh, as are the cilantro and onions. The salsa is also very good. I've never had the mildest salsa but the hottest one and the second hottest are both very good. Their pinto beans aren't great, the juice is very thin and they don't have much flavor. Again, this item needs salt. Overall, the tacos are excellent if you add salt to the meat. They also have PBR on tap so that's pretty awesome. Their service is good, no one is extremely friendly but they're not awful either. Food comes out relatively fast, I will continue coming here and I would definitely recommend this place. Great, quick food and they have pretty good deals like two tacos and a 12 ounce PBR for$3.99. Plus if you're staying at the Plaza, there's a couple of coupons offered."}
{"text":"I've gotten a few things from here, from zalapeno balls, to quesadillas to burritos, to fish tacos. I have not been disappointed.  I stand by their \"best of las vegas\" fish tacos when normally, that is an item I would never order, but now I crave them. Service is top notch with lot of smiles from employees. Great job!"}
{"text":"The food we ordered was fresh and tasty. We will return, but hopefully they will have cleaned (dusted) the rafters in the ceiling. When the door opens on a windy day...you can see the dust bunnies floating around and down, to your table (plate). Just look up when you are sitting in the seating area!"}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent. Anyone that likes Chipotle must try this place...it's a local chain that puts them to shame. How?   1) sweet potatoes! They offer sweet potato pieces as options for any of the entrees (burrito, tacos, bowl, etc). Whoever thought of putting this in Mexican food is a genius!  2) option for wheat tortilla! Tastier & healthier makes it an option that every build-your-own Mexican place should have.   3) more generous portions. I've been to Chipotle about half a dozen times...the burrito I end up with there weighs maybe 1/2 to 2/3rd that of Zabas...it's amazing how much fresh ingredients they can fit in those Zabas burritos!  Over the past year and a half, I've been here over 50 times, and it's always been a great experience."}
{"text":"Gross! This place is kinda dirty and thier nachos with no meat were almost $10. Way over priced and way disgusting. They had a sour taste and left a weird taste in my mouth. Will never eat there again. I called to get a refund for my nachos and still the manager made me drive all the way back to make sure I hadn't eaten them. Just thinking about this place makes me sick."}
{"text":"Always fresh and great staff! I always get the veggie bowl. Never had an issue with the quality of food, it's an awesome go to!"}
{"text":"The service was very poor here I know it's in a casino but 2 other places I went seemed to, you know care at all about what I wanted to eat. The two women there ignored use until we spoke up.(even though we were at the counter they were too busy speaking Spanish to care) One of them begrudgingly put together my burrito like she was doing me a favor. And they other women talked in Spanish to some women that had her kid running all over. Then when they went to ring me up and I said that my girlfriend needed food is the only time they acknowledged her. The sour cream was almost milk the meat was almost tasteless and when they understood what I said they were rude."}
{"text":"We love this place! It's pretty good fast food (and healthy-ish) type Mexican food. The menu is not extensive, but the servings are plentiful. Sort of like Chipotle, but ten times better. And I believe kids eat for free on the weekends.  They also serve breakfast in the mornings (u'mmm chorizo!)."}
{"text":"I have been eagerly awaiting the opening on Silverado Ranch, and I was not disappointed.    The atmosphere was relaxed and the table area roomy and clean.  The ingredients were fresh and seasoned wonderfully.  My favorite is the salad bowl with beans, grilled shrimp and red sauce.   Zabas will finely l definitely become a regular lunch spot."}
{"text":"If you like Chipotle and that type of Mexican food and want it just a little bit healthier, then Zaba's is the place!  Besides the normal Chipotle flare they add shrimp, whole wheat tortilla's and brown rice into the mix. Making it that much easier to make your food that much better for you.  Not to say that those choices alone make it healthy but it gives you more options to do so.  Overall it's a great place when your craving a big burrito!"}
{"text":"7:30pm on a thursday - noone dining inside but a line of ppl waiting to order so i assume its worth the wait. (My 1st time here)  The employees seemed like a nice and laid back group of ladies. For some reason, my husband and i got pushed through along with the 2 other ppl ordering behind us and the lady at the end of the line at the register put my order in 2 different bags, mixing up mine and the other 2 orders. So instead of listening to her co-worker who was trying to help, the cashier gives free food away but charges for extra sides of chips/guac/salsa/sour cream - $4 guac must be equivilant to a chicken burrito.   Anyway, the food was decent. Nothing spectacular and nothing stood out to me. The fish tacos are similar to Rubio's fish tacos except Zabas are dry. If you want a BOMB fish taco, go to Rubios."}
{"text":"I have been going here for many years as I work nearby and have never grown tired of their food. In the 5+ years I have been going there I have never had one complaint and have always recieved the same quality of food. Maria the manager there is the best! She knows all of her regulars there, talks to them and remembers what they've been up too. There was one point when I had a job on the other side of town for about a year and never had a chance to visit. But when she saw me a year later she new exactly who I was, my name and asked how I've been. Ended up having a 5 minute conversation with her. They treat you like family here and that is why they are my favorite restaurant even after all these years."}
{"text":"The ladies thay work there act like they get commision on how much they domt give you. I orderd a bowl with no rice or beans so i had plenty of room and yet she gives me a little scoop of lettuce.I asked for more and she got an attitude..WOW its LETTUCE! I asked her for green salsa on the side and she gave me 1 with for 2 bowls lol...real bitch!"}
{"text":"I swear their potatoes are magical.  Imagine a Chipotle setup, but with a slew of healthier options.  I don't ever order the healthy options...but they are there if for some reason you want to feel better about your enormous burrito.  You can fill your whole-wheat tortilla with brown rice and sweet potatoes.  Might I recommend the regular potatoes, however?  They are just yum-tastic.  Not the greatest meal you'll ever have, but a good, cheap, huge burrito to fill you up.  I like it better than Chipotle.  And it's a local business, which is always a good thing to support."}
{"text":"Working downtown can make finding lunch tough, but Zabas is always good and pretty reasonable. The Chicken Burrito is big, and you probably won't be able to finish it the first time. It takes practice."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Vegas.. Open til 12 too. The sauce is nice and spicy. Nice size too. The really cool thing is that have cabage too as an option."}
{"text":"Their shrimp burrito is as yummy as I remember.  I've been eagerly waiting for this location to open since they closed their location on S Eastern.  They now have a Coke Freestyle machine too."}
{"text":"Got the $4.31 deal for 2 Fremont street tacos and a 12oz PBR. The deal was not on the menu or advertised anywhere that I could see, but I asked a worker about it and they knew exactly what I was talking about. The street tacos are small, about 3 bites each, but they were good. I got one shredded beef and one chicken, both with corn salsa, onions, and cilantro. The shredded beef had more meat in it. See the picture I posted for a visual."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying the food is good at Zabas, but an equally important thing for me is the wide variety of choices.  If you have allergies or dieting concerns you can still put together a good meal here without cheating. The concept looks like it was based on Chipotle, but they have taken it a couple of steps further.  Quite frankly, I think it blows away Chipotle."}
{"text":"Zaba's food is super fresh and healthy. The perfect pre-game meal before a night out in Vegas. Found out it was a locally owned restaurant as well. You can tell by how fresh the food tastes and the quality of service.   Pro Tip* Sweet Potatoes and Queso IN your burrito. Life changing."}
{"text":"Very consistent food and service. I love everything here and your food  is always served quickly from the line. Get the rewards card and really eat up!!!! portions are large!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, in fact I eat at this location about five times a week. Super fresh food with great flavor and very clean. I like that they use high quality meats and not fatty cheap meat with tons of lard (gross). If you want good fresh mexican flavor downtown this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Will NOT come back. Came here this Sunday afternoon. Food was bland,serving was stingy and overpriced. Servers were not friendly and did not know about their own promotions. I showed that I checked in on FB to get the free brownie promo and the crew was clueless ,even though there are signs posted around the entire place about this promo."}
{"text":"Thought I would give it a second chance, should have listened to my inner voice telling me to drive a little further and go to Chipotle. The amount of the meat and toppings is a joke, they use just the corner of the spoon to scoop, maybe a third of the spoon if even that much. There more expensive also, the burrito bowls is more than a dollor more and when you pay extra for gaucamole you expect to actually get an amount you can taste in your food...Chipotle  gives a full spoon! Also for being a new location why does it smell so bad when you walk in, smells like bad chicken.Very let down by this restaurant,won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Owner is now harassing me about making his business look bad. How is there no report button for harassment?! Call me the b* and tell me that I'm mean to businesses. I'm just truthful."}
{"text":"Zaba's food is generally good and I love the little potatoes, but this Zaba's location is poorly staffed and the people are just plain unpleasant.  Unfortunately, this location is close to my office and I come here on occasion for lunch.  It never ceases to be a hassle to deal with the ignorant staff.  So, if you're going to eat at this location, be prepared.  They are so rude it makes the food taste bad."}
{"text":"They had a great Mother's Day Free Entree Offer with a purchase of a drink. I have never heard about that.  I think it's a wonderful idea.  There were 3 total workers and they were pretty busy. I enjoyed the Chicken Nachos I ordered, it was plenty, the only thing was, I didn't know that they charged me for the guacamole.  The server should of mentioned it. Otherwise, great little place and what a deal!"}
{"text":"This place charges extra for everything like salsa, sour cream and guacamole etc.. they hardly put any In your meal so when you ask they say thatd extra. Food isn't even that good and cold. Waste of money."}
{"text":"I love this place. My brother and I went here last weekend to get some fish tacos and a burrito bowl. I guess they were out of fish, so he got a shredded beef burrito instead. They comped our queso and our drinks for us since we weren't able to get the fish tacos. Totally unexpected! Seriously the nicest staff ever! And the food is always so fresh! Absolutely obsessed with the shrimp !!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I think their barbacoa burritos are better than Chipotles. Staff is friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Came in having been referred by an employee. I was pleased to find the location very clean and maintained. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and taken through the line of food. The staff was very sweet and helpful. I ordered a chicken burrito with the basics (plus guac which is naturally extra $) and enjoyed every bite. The components of my food were all fresh and warm. Will be a regular here.  As a side note, the music is great. While I normally hear old school pop and indie at Chipotle's, at Zappa's I enjoyed Radiohead, Nirvana and Sublime."}
{"text":"This review is 100% based on the horrible attitude and service I received.  It is for that reason I have no interest in going back and would not recommend to friends.  The place looks great, the menu was easy to navigate and I would probably be a regular there if the employees had not treated me like a cheap because I ordered my 10 year old Son a quesadilla and did not order anything for myself.  It was right after school and we were in the shopping center.  Anyway after being given our order i asked them for a salsa for his food and they said it wasn't included.  I am sorry but I cannot recommend or return to a mexican food restaurant where they charge you for your 1st salsa!!  They then got extremely rude when I questioned it and the lady literally told me anything that comes with salsa states it on the menu... i proceeded to point out a handful of menu items that they confirmed came with salsa but it was not noted on the menu.  I am fine with places charging for extra sauces etc but for a quesadilla with beans and rice they should have given me 1 salsa and none of the other employees stepped in."}
{"text":"Best fast food style Mexican in the area that doesn't give you diarrhea. Yes I'm talking about you, chipotle. Lots of different things to order, you know exactly what's going into your food, and they give you A LOT of it. They're generally pretty quick and not too packed most of the time, so it's ideal if your just picking food up, or you want to dine in."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. The food is still good but the service sucks. The employees are too busy talking amongst themselves than attend the customers. I don't know if management changed but I've never been ignored while waiting to order. I know I won't be back and I'll let my family and friends not to bother with this place."}
{"text":"We brought a Groupon for this place for our trip. It was a tousand times better than Chipolte's or Qdoba! There was more variety of ingrediets and choices. I had 3 chicken tacos with lettuce, cabbage, sour chrem, cheese and the hottest most wonderful salsa. My boyfriend had a grilled shrimp with peppers, onions, black beans, and tons of other things.  We will definitely eat here when we're in Vegas again later this year."}
{"text":"There is really only one menu item that gives this restaurant cause for 3 stars otherwise it would probably be a 1 or 2 star joint. That is the \"Doug's Surf and Turf\". Too bad Doug cant design customer service the same way he designed this great shrimp and steak burrito! NO calling ahead for take out. Perturbed burritesses at regular customers, make you feel like a major killjoy for ruining their empty restaurant atmosphere with your surf and turf order. still this location is better than the new one at Summerlin. That place is abyssmal."}
{"text":"This place is horrendous and the management couldnt care less. Dried old food. depleted cooked ingredients that are only cooked and replenished after someone waits in line for a half hour and orders them. avoid this place like the plague - go to a different zaba's! I gave this one a couple chances but the quality and attitude is too poor to deal with."}
{"text":"Not that Zaba's needs help, their food speaks for itself, but this location is awesome. One of the managers and one of the girls that transferred from the Silverado location are so personable. They always ask how we've been and when we havent been in, in while, they notice! Its nice to have a spot that they actually remember who you are and seemingly actually care and you arent just another customer. And of course we love the food!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Steak tacos are amazing. Breakfast quesadilla is very good and healthy. I suggest Wheat tortilla, egg whites, turkey sausage and pico de gallo."}
{"text":"First time. I had the shredded beef tacos and they were so salty I could hardly eat them. It was clean and fast service so that was a plus. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Place is a dump...staff members are rude and discourteous and they always run out of meats and potatoes, what's the point of all of the options if you never have them? Poor management..."}
{"text":"Hella Good way better than Chipotle.... I've been eating here everyday so 2day I decided to write a comment Great Customer Service. Food is awesome I have no Complaints what so Ever!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Similar to Chipotle in that you can create your own. Guac was also great and they have the Coca Cola soda machine where you can create your own flavors."}
{"text":"Just go to chipotle . She gave me hardly any guacamole and I didn't get and meat or cheese or sour cream so I thought she would at least have the common decency to give me a proper size of guac. She didn't even give me a full spoonful , heck not even a half spoonful. Whatever definitely not going back. They should close that place down and put a chipotle instead"}
{"text":"First of all the customer service sucked. They are stupid incompetent uneducated and rude. At least try to have some knowledge of what you're selling. Offer a wider variety for people who might be allergic to Chipotle or not like hot flavors. Way too much money being asked for crappy food. We paid $26 for two meals that got thrown away. Upon leaving we requested a comment card but was given a business card along with a phony smile. If you want to play dragon for a day and throw fire from your mouth or if you want your throat ears and butthole to burn and you want to throw away good money you don't have.. then eat here..here's flamin bruh"}
{"text":"If you like Chipotle's, you will like this place, as they are identical. This is a \"fresh and healthy\" type restaurant. I went for lunch with my wife. Basically, you pick the item you want, I had steak tacos, and then you add the toppings you want, all for one price.     After spooning my \"marinated, then grilled\" steak into the tortillas from the hot line, I was rushed over to the cold line for additional toppings, bypassing beans, rice, etc. I had the lady go back to  the hot line to get the toppings I wanted then back to the cold line. I felt that I was being rushed through the line even though no one was behind me! I managed to find the only salt shaker in the place, and had to use Cholula hot sauce to have any flavor on the food. Very bland food, can't call this a Mexican restaurant in any way. Bland food, rushed through the line, not a good exp.    The only good things are guac was good, restrooms were clean, quantity of food was decent for the price."}
{"text":"Way better than Chipotle, and they are a local restaurant! Now quit reading this and go eat!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing .. We ordered a shrimp taco.. Was cold!! Ordered a surf & turf burrito and THAT was cold.. Never coming here again.. :(.. Btw.. Only added 1 star because I couldn't post comment w/out.. Otherwise they'd get NO star"}
{"text":"I have always been a HUGE fan of Zaba's -- but since they've been under new ownership (OriZaba's) the prices have gone up significantly and portion sizes have diminished.  If the food wasn't so amazing, I wouldn't come here any more ...  very disappointing"}
{"text":"Honsetly i have been to this  location  a lot of times and i have never been treated like this ever. When i came in on tuesday the 14th at 8 that night and ceclie i think thats how u spell her name was very rude to me and i was being so nice to her then i ask for  guacamole sauce and she gave me a pinch of it  and i said i have never got just a lil of it everytime i came everyone esle would five a spoon full and she said well i will have to charge u double if i give u more then a pinch i was so upset because i have never treated like this ever and im not the one to give bad reveiws unless the person really dersevre it this was just the wrose how she treated me that night. And i really love zabas but im so upset i wont come to this one again!"}
{"text":"It is my new favorite place to eat. They have great service and great food. the Pros are Fresh Food Great prices"}
{"text":"Honestly, I love the food here. I've been coming here since I was in high school, and never once had an issue. The credit card terminal probably malfunctioned, I really don't think that the company had done any of this maliciously. And they refunded everything, obviously. I wouldn't let 1 issue in the last 9 years that they've been opened deter you from coming back here. Maybe just grab a receipt and hang on to it until you see the transactions post."}
{"text":"food is mediocre. staff isnt so friendly. charged me for extra ranch dressing on my tacos. definitely wouldnt recommend this place."}
{"text":"Better than chipotle, cafe rio, rubios all combined. They give you such big portions here, are super friendly and accommodate your every need. The best thing about this place is your can get potatoes on your food! It's something so simple but so different for fast Mexican food. Clean atmosphere and their Zalapeno Balls with the chipotle ranch & cilantro are AMAZING. I either dip them in the ranch with cilantro or break up the zalapeno balls and put them in my bowl and it's life changing. Wow, I'm hungry just typing this. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone especially if you're looking for somewhere new to go besides Chipotle."}
{"text":"All I can say is YUM!!! I love this place. My favorite is the shrimp and chicken bowl. Always fresh and decent portion sizes. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"In a long search for inexpensive tacos we finally found Zaba's.  Excellent fast food.  It's like a 5 Guys or Subway for Tacos.  You can build your own like a Subway order.  Try it for a quick taco fix."}
{"text":"What can I say... I just LOVE Zabas. I could probably eat here every day! And they have the best fresh brewed ice teas I've found anywhere. I love that they have potatoes and sweet potatoes as an option for your wrap/bowl/taco etc."}
{"text":"I definitely got food poisoning from this place my first night in town and I was puking the rest of my vacation! So if you love eating and keeping it down, perhaps choose another place. However, if you live life on the edge, the burrito bowl was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I decided to give it a try for lunch today. Great experience through out the visit. I ordered the fish tacos and boy was I in for a treat, each bite was full of flavor. Good portion of fish with the usual choice of toppings you'd find at chipotle or cafe rio and a few that were new to me. For the most part it may seem like you're in chipotle but I like the way Zabas serves their portions and mix it up a bit. They also have a loyalty program as well!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend brought home the Zaba bowl for dinner and it was not good at all. It tasted like a bland version of Chipotle. The rice and chicken was also very dry."}
{"text":"I don't even like Mexican food that much to begin with... But I don't mind repeating this place every week.  Why I think Zaba's tastes so much better than other (Americanized) tacos joint... Like Qdobas, Chipotle, or Baja Fresh... I don't really know. I can't explain. I guess I am just madly in love with their unique recipe ? I must also add that quality of the food is fairy consistent here, which gives me peace of mind. Just a little F.Y. I. I just had jalapeño poppers for the first time, and I am ready to drive back there for some more :)"}
{"text":"Overpriced and frankly it was gross. I got the surf and turf burrito; everything came from a steam pan so nothing was actually hot just lukewarm and when they added on the half cup of guacamole, it all turned lukewarm. And really, who wants that much guacamole on their burrito. The tortilla wasn't even warmed before making the burrito. The chips... oh the chips. Remember that horrible \"baked\" chip fad that hit the country in the mid 90's? Well apparently Zaba's bought out the stock when that product went under. Cardboard. It was basically salted cardboard. I could forgive cheap and disgusting chips if the salsa was any good but unfortunately the fresh salsa sucked. The tomatoes were translucent and looked like they had been frozen at some point and salsa verde was flavorless and disappointing. After spending $30 on a burrito, fish tacos, two chips and salsas and two sodas, I took about 6 bites (I gave it a fair shot) and then went next door to Panda Express. If you want good, fresh, Mexican food, this is not the place. If you want a crappy knock off of chipotle with higher prices than by all means, try Zaba's."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE Zabas fan and have always liked it much better than chipotle.  I was so excited that this location was opening as it is less than 5 minutes from my house! I went there very often at first, but it quickly started to decline in quality. The chicken is very fatty and the beans rarely taste fresh. The lettuce is commonly brown and chopped way too large. I was beginning to be turned off towards Zabas completely. Until I was in Henderson visiting a friend and she suggested we get Zabas for dinner, so we went to the location on Silverado Ranch Pkwy and Maryland. It rekindled my love for Zabas! It was so fresh and the chicken had no fat! It was heaven in a bowl.  So this leads me to believe that the Durango location needs to pay more attention to detail and to ensure that their ingredients are fresh and of great quality like the other locations. I really hope they start getting better because I would love to have Zabas back on my regular list of restaurants!"}
{"text":"It was decent. Had high expectations from the reviews, was disappointed. Interior was nice. When I ate my burrito, the rice, beans, and meat were all cold. Nice to know it wasn't fresh and their Warmer couldn't even do its job especially for the price. I don't see why this place gets long lines, if you actually want fresh and a nicely done burrito place, try FREEBIRDS."}
{"text":"Always friendly and service with a smile... the food always tastes fresh and although my order is complicated the friendly staff always gets it right. I switched over to Zabas when their main competition started having quality issues... I will continue to support this local family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"The amount of Zabas I eat is insane. Before I cut meat out of my diet, I had the chicken three items- flour tortilla, chicken, hot salsa, and cilantro.  Now I have their veggie or papa's bowls with lots of sweet potatoes, fajitas, and guac! And speaking of guac... Their guac Is fresh, their queso is the definition of liquid gold, their pesto and ranch are perfect with everything, and everything is fresh. I even turned the hubbitron- who doesn't even like these establishments- into a fan.   If that enough doesn't make you want to go there, just know, their brownies are the softest and chewiest pieces of yum that you'll ever have."}
{"text":"Very disappointed ! Very average! Poor choices very limited and not appealing to the eye. Cold chips sad salsa."}
{"text":"I don't understand the bf's fascination with this place. However, it is right across the street from our house, so it mainly gets points for convenience. It is extremely over priced, the volume of toppings they give u is laughable. They up-charge for everything. We went tonight (Wednesday-630pm) and they were out of literally all meat and shrimp choices except for carnitas. Also were out of potatoes and had to wait 10 minutes for them. We literally were the only ones in the place. Lady helping us was very rude. Food is decent, but would definitely prefer Q'doba or Chipotle if they were closer. While we were waiting for the potatoes a different lady came out and I decided to order a drink, and since we were waiting so long she just gave it to me. Only positive thing. 2 stars are for convenience (for us) and decent tasting food."}
{"text":"Best one out of the other Zabas.  Great food and great value.  Very friendly staff.  Skipping out on Chipotle and Baja Rott....Fresh."}
{"text":"Great service but I've come in multiple times and BOTH soda fountains have been out of almost every drink. Get it together Zabas!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5! 10 if I could. I have been going to \"my fave\" place since 04. Yum yum. Service is just a food line. But food is awesomeness goodness. For years I have been turning people on to this local chain. Im like a spokeswoman for em  just ask my family. I have had my bday lunch there now 6 years in a row. Lol. Its bad when u baby says zabas. If you havnt been to ome in the valley you should go asap!"}
{"text":"For what I got I really wasnt impressed, I got a chicken burrito bowl and a side of queso and chips. It wasnt bad but it wasnt OMG I gotta come back. Their queso was to runny and bland...I've had better at other places that have a similar concept. The service could use some help too....it usually helps to acknowledge people who are coming into your establishment."}
{"text":"Hmmmm.... the owners changed. They removed Zabapeño balls. They did add corn on the cob... it was very tasty... but a little pricy $5."}
{"text":"This place is great!!!  It's a little bit like Chipotle, but better in my opinion.  They use fried cubed potatoes in a lot of the menu items.  Super delicious and good prices!!!  Sometimes the line is a little bit long, but that is a sign of good food!  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the food, tried a few different things, tacos, taquitos and the corn. Everything was fresh and excellently seasoned. Missed out on the ceviche so I will be heading back soon and often. Super friendly staff made it a great experience since I took forever trying to decide what I wanted. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"The first time I went here it was delicious. The last 2 times it has been awful. I got a chicken quesadilla with burnt chicken and BARELY any cheese. The last time, I did 3 chicken corn tacos. The chicken was nasty again!! It's like I'm getting left over burnt pieces of chicken. My friend did chicken tacos as well and it was the same.The employees also seem to be irritated too. I won't be coming back. The prices went up and the quality went down."}
{"text":"Very good food, as good as Chipolte but different fare. Such as quesadillas and an amazing shrimp taco cooked after you order it."}
{"text":"I love Zaba's! They are always so quick and nice here! All the ladies here are wonderful! Thanks for always taking care of me."}
{"text":"I love this place because they had brown rice and tortillas before Chipotle ever did. The food is as healthy as you want it to be but it also has guilty pleasures like quesadillas. I especially love the shrimp bowl. I only wish they had a drive-thru!"}
{"text":"The tortillas are not good & the meat either I didn't like it & it was pricey for the quality & they gave me the tacos in a bag instead or a box I was just not satisfied. Never going there again"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times. I absolutely love this place. The street corn is one of the best u can have. As well as the fish tacos and the chicken nachos. Anything on the menu is good  you will not be disappointed. Service here is unreal. There is a 2 managers a lady and a male. Both were soo pleasant and nice to deal with. Thank you. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time today. As others have already noted, it's modeled very closely after Chipotle. This doesn't bother me though. As long as the food is good and our business is appreciated (meaning great service) they can emulate whoever they like.    The service is quick, the staff is friendly and the burrito I ordered was great. Wheat tortilla, brown rice, fajita veggies, black beans, chicken with a small splash of sour cream and a dash of lettuce. The burrito was pretty big. I'd say it was about the size of a small Nerf football - seriously.   However, and I'm not trying to be a wiener here, the place could be a little cleaner. A thorough sweep and scrub of the floors would go a long way.     Floors aside, I'm going back. Next time I'm going to try the shrimp and most likely the tacos."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at best. They nickel & dime you. Ordered food for take out for my family of 4 & they wouldn't give me the included drink with the kids meal because my child was not present, really?! I ordered a side of chips & had to pay separately for salsa. I will never return to this place & will not recommend it for the simple fact that not including the kids drink as advertised, because the child is not present is pretty tacky & cheap. The mall is surrounded by residential areas & I'm sure I'm not the only mother bringing home dinner to the family after shopping. Food is also sub par & customer service was lacking.   There is a nearby Moe's & Chipotle which offers tastier food, better service & much better value for your money."}
{"text":"Dissapointed. I've been a regular customer for about 4 years and the food is not the same. The chicken is salty and no flavor. It looks like the recipes changed. Not going back. Not worth it."}
{"text":"I have been to a few Zabas around the valley and I have got to say this is the best one around. First of all if you haven't already been to a Zabas you are really missing out. The food is absolutely delicious and you will not be sorry with just about anything on the menu. My personal favorite is the chicken bowl with sweet potatoes and rice but from the fish tacos to the burritos you will not be dispointed."}
{"text":"its a little better than chipotle, same price range, the only thing i enjoyed were the fish tacos, which are not offered at chipotle. the fish tacos were good and freshly made, thats enough for me to choose Zaba's over Chipotle."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic if you like huge ice cold burritos.  Wtf guys?! You suck,  I was so hungry and I had to throw away my 12 dollar burrito.  Bullshit.   Get your propotions and warmers in check.   Gross"}
{"text":"Love this place! I always order the steak quesadilla and I never get sick of it. The staff is great and the food always fresh and delicious. I would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"So many options to choose from... I never thought I'd say this but this restaurant is better than Chipotle! They offer so many mix ins to choose from and the price is unbelievable low. Would give this place a 5 stars if they kept the tables cleaner but other than that this place is amazzzing"}
{"text":"They would get a 5 because the food was great, but the place was filled with bugs. Ex. there was one where people grab theyre menus! Hopefully theyre grade is A for health."}
{"text":"Chipotle, Qdoba, Zaba's........  Like many other Americanized burrito joints, Zaba's offers a lot of the same.  You choose your protein, beans, rice, salsa, fillings, they roll, you eat.  I may be the only person to hate Chipotle, so if you're a fan you may like Zaba's as well.  My experience there wasn't all bad.  The place is clean, the staff friendly and happy to let you try one of the meats before choosing it in your burrito.  I don't think this is any better or worse than Chipotle or Qdoba, it's just that all these places are average at best.    I went with the shredded beef tacos.  The beef was a little dry and not too flavorful, but the hot salsa and pico de gallo helped.   I had the chicken nachos as well.  The queso sauce they use is salty and while many people will like it, I did not.  I wouldn't come back here, but again, I'm not a fan of this type of place, so take my review with a grain of salt, or in the case of the queso, lots of salt."}
{"text":"Love this place!  My first time there the employee was so nice and helped me order because I wasn't sure how to.   The food was so good!  And you get a lot for your money.  I ate dinner and then had left overs for lunch the next day.   Very nice staff.  Very fresh and yummy food.     I highly recommend Zaba's.  Way better than Chipotle!!"}
{"text":"It's like chipotle but better! Fresh and tasty.   Very BIG burritos. Had to bring half back to the room for later."}
{"text":"This is the best Zabas!  We ordered catering for 10 people and pickup the next morning. Arrived and the food was all ready for me to go. The chicken and beef were perfect... every dish that was supposed to be hot was piping hot at pickup and still hot when we went to serve everyone. Everything that was supposed to be cold was ice cold. They provided everything right down to the plates,napkins,utensils,and even the serving spoons we didnt have to worry about anything. They even carried everything to the car. The presentation of the food was awesone and eveyone at the party was super impressed. The food was delicious chicken and beef were marinated perfectly and the chipotle ranch dressing that the manager recommended was a hit with everyone! We would tell anyone that is looking for great catering for any event that they need to go to this zabas. Thank you to the entire staff for such a great experience! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If I'm hungover, or just hungry and looking for something quick, this is the spot I will go 95% of the time.  Not the best mexican food out there, but the portions are big, flavors bold, and service accommodating."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Zaba's for years and always loved the food. It's similar to a Chipotle except a bigger menu. The food is freshly made and very tasty. I usually have a Zaba bowl which is always a good choice. On this visit I tried the steak fries which was very yummy. In the past if you wanted a little extra of something they wouldn't charge you but this has changed. They will charge you extra for everything. Staff is generally nice if not a bit rushed. I highly recommend Zaba's for a tasty fresh meal."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite to eat. The food is super fresh and super tasty! I think everything is made fresh daily.  Customer service is fast and friendly. Ordering here is similar to Chipotle or Subway- you get to pick your condiments/veggies. It's a great place for lunch or a quick dinner.  I love the Zaba bowls and the shrimp tacos; homemade brownies are great too. The dining room is very clean and well lit. It's located in the same strip mall as Buffalo Wild Wings, Panda Express, the Cupcakery in vicinity of Kohls and Petsmart."}
{"text":"Better than Chipotle. Fresh healthy Mexican food. I love this place."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE MEXICAN PLACE ! It's better than chipotle, the sweet potatoes are to die for . If you go get ANY bowl and you won't regret it. Loved this place for many years , sad they closed the eastern location"}
{"text":"Clean, healthy, friendly service for a good value. My husband comes here almost every day for lunch or dinner and they keep his waistline in check. So glad this location is open near us and will continue to frequent."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Zaba's and a firm believer that it is far superior to Chipotle, Cafe Rio or any other similar restaurant for several reasons:   - There's WAY more options - white AND brown rice, yellow AND sweet potatoes, shrimp AND fish tacos, steak AND shredded beef, quesadillas AND nachos, wheat AND flour tortillas. - The owners are friendly locals. This isn't part of a national franchise, so support your community!  - Lastly: the cilantro-walnut pesto. It's refreshing, rich and one of the best things I've added to a taco."}
{"text":"I have been going here since it opened in 2001 and for the first time , I was treated very rudely by an ignorant foreigner employee named Michelle. She treated my husband like a homeless person  and complained out loud , behind his back that he was stealing her pre sliced lemons. We were buying food  and like lemons . SUE ME. I cant believe theyre soo cheap or lazy? Ill bring you a bag of lemons ! ILL CUT THE DAMN LEMONS.This person doesnt treat guests friendly and that is an un American way of treating people. I WOULD NEVER TREAT MY PAYING CUSTOMERS LIKE THIS. She is obviously a very low class, product of her environment.Has this area gone down hill? Bad service . Bad attitude . Very abusive .The original owner , that I met, wouldnt have let this happen."}
{"text":"My go-to place for a quick burrito or burrito bowl! This place tops chipotle by far with so many more flavors and options; including potatoes! (The best part). This establishment is always very clean and the employees are very nice and listen to my order carefully and never skimp on the portions. I really wish they would bring back those potato balls because those were to die for!   I get the vegetarian bowl with white rice, black beans, fajitas, extra potatoes, green salsa, corn, cilantro, lime, onion, guac and cabbage!   They also serve street corn, have featured drinks like horchata! Yummm.  You can get a \"rewards\" card and build up points towards free food! So worth it.   My only complaint is that their soda machine is always out of a lot of choices but that's not worth knocking off a star."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! I come here regularly for lunch. The ceviche is soooo good."}
{"text":"This place is similar to Chipotle except they have more variety in protein choices and extras. Aside from your standard chicken, steak, salsas, they have shrimp and fish and from what I can remember as extras they had cilantro and limes! I think for the burrito option, they ask if you'd like the tortilla to be whole wheat or not. It seems they cook the fish to-order so you know you're getting something off the grill which is nice, but might not be a good choice if you want to just grab and go. Zaba's provides a nice alternative in the Plaza if you're not feeling McDonalds or Subway. This place isn't 24 hours like the aforementioned but if it happens to be open while you're here, why not? This is a solid place and their portions are generous enough to make you feel pretty full (granted, I've only had their Zaba bowl)."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this store and service. It's better then the one on flamingo and Pecos. The staff is so friendly here and they are not greedy with the portions. THANK YOU ORI'ZABA'S"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy!  You can get fresh and healthy items and the burritos are huge!  They are consistent and fast and everyone seems to work hard.  They really know how to hire people and I wish them success.  I have introduced many friends and they are now fans too."}
{"text":"I def had high hopes for this place from the hype they showed at Bite of Las Vegas & the reviews I read on here. I was pretty excited to see they had a burrito w/ chicken, steak, & shrimp, but they said they were out of steak. How do you run out of steak when it's a staple on your menu?!? When I did find something to order I realized that the setup is much like Chipotle. They did have an extra item which was the potato squares. I ended up getting a chicken burrito w/ the potatoes, cheese, brown rice, salsa, & lettuce. The burrito was a very good size, maybe slightly bigger than what you would find at Chipotle. Bit in & expected awesomeness, totally not the case. It didn't have the same taste as Chipotle, then again it didn't taste fresh. Not sure if it was the chicken or what, but if I do decide to try them again I would wanna try something else as it wasn't very tasty. The establishment was clean & the staff was helpful & friendly."}
{"text":"We had the shrimp and the chicken burritos it was just average and the tap beer Modelo was not working yet. They need to cook the tortillas a little longer. They do have selections of alcohol and they do have bathrooms inside also. Patio dining as well"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time finally after multiple trips to the mall saying I'm gonna have to try that place out....I'm so glad I finally did! I will most definitely be back too. I had a steak burrito and it was absolutely delicious. Their green salsa is also really good"}
{"text":"Great food,  great service.  My family eats here once a week. We love it when Saul is working.  He really makes the store what it is.  He's always smiling, very professional and always willing to help.  I would definitely recommend the fish tacos or steak bowl."}
{"text":"I want to give this place a higher review because the food is good, but every time I am served by the older Latina lady I leave unhappy. She is very unpleasant.  I am the easiest orderer. I don't know what her deal is. If she doesn't like her love of work, she should find a new one. I go there often, but sometimes if I see her through the window I turn around and go elsewhere. I don't need the bad vibes."}
{"text":"It was a gorgeous 70 degrees in Vegas yesterday.  Today it was about 50 degrees. The only thing colder was our food.    This was our first time visiting this small local Las Vegas chain of \"quick service\" Mexican food restaurants.  After a long morning of braving the cold hiking Red Rock (yes, I'm well aware that it is below zero in Wisconsin ... which is why I don't live there, but that's another story), we were looking forward to warming up with some lunch.     The food choices at \"Downtown Summerlin\" are rather sparse, and Zaba's won out over Italian.    I ordered the chicken bowl, she had the veggie burrito.   OK, so I'm exaggerating a little when I write that the food was below 50 degrees ... more accurately it was luke warm at best.  Having noticed that the cheese hadn't melted as we paid the cashier, we inquired if the food could be warmed up; a direct \"no\" was the response.  Alrighty then; at least we knew where we stood on that topic.    Aside from that, it was your average QSR Mexican food.  The food was tasty enough - nothing special, but nothing horrible.  While they served beer, which was a nice touch, it was disappointing that they didn't have a place to recycle the bottles. The restaurant was quite clean, and the staff (although not very helpful) was friendly.     In short, if you're starving, it'll fill you up.  But hopefully as more restaurants open at \"Downtown Summerlin\", there'll be better options."}
{"text":"Food is ok. It's decent for a quick bite in Vegas. but the prices are way too high for their stingy portions and horrible service.  If you're in Vegas, go somewhere else. You're better off going to Mc Donalds.  The only reason I would visit this place is because it's convenient and I'm probably starving, but still after visiting numerous times I'm always disappointed and not satisfied.   Rice is always hard! Ask for guacamole they'll charge $2 for barely 2oz. Extra shrimp $4 for 6 pieces. The servers seem to never understand or get my order right."}
{"text":"Zabas is the best hands down.  Love the Carne Asada Burrito."}
{"text":"We just happen to come across this place and we stopped here for lunch. We were group of 5 guys and we got some good food and it was heavy (comments from other guys). I wasn't too hungry so just grabbed some chips with queso and a fish taco. The taco was pretty good, the queso definitely wasn't good. Not worth it but the chips were pretty good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat! My husband and I dine here at least once a week. The ingredients are fresh and way better than Chipotle. I love that they have the option for wheat tortilla. Honestly, anything I've tried has been amazing. Clean environment. Great staff! They actually remember our orders..probably because we frequent the place so much. The rewards program is worth it. You can earn pints for free meals which add up pretty quickly. Don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Just getting around to writing my review, this was our 3rd time eating here and the food is fantastic. The only reason i didnt give it more stars is some of the employees could use some customer service training. It is located in the Plaza hotels food court. It is a much better bargain than the McDonalds & Subway located here. The place is clean and food always looks and tastes fresh. They have beer. I dont think we have these in CA, but its basically Chipotle, but a lil better to me. They pack the food into whatever item u pick. They have clothing and other things to purchase. We will be back"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving a quesadilla I come straight here. There's just something about them that makes it so delicious. Maybe it's the cheese? I also always order a bag of chips to dip in my guacamole/salsa. There's many burrito options here, you can make almost anything you want. One of my favorite little Mexican spots."}
{"text":"This place is similar to Chipotle...if I had to pick between the two, I would pick Zaba...It's in a great location...It's ridiculous hot in Las Vegas, so try parking at the a parking structure that's really close by to keep your car cool...but the food here is delicious. You can get a bowl, which I ordered. Tacos, Quesadilla, Burrito, Nachos...You can chose from Grilled Chicken, Grilled Steak, Shredded Beef, Carnitas, Grilled Lime Shrimp, & Fish Tacos... There's more, you just have to go check it out for yourself. They do have a kids menu...No problems with the employees...I'm avoiding Soda, but they have those machines where you have a laundry list of Soda's that you can select from...1 thing I think is cool is that they have USB chargers and wall outlets at the booths to charge your phones or whatever...& when you're done eating, you have the off the hook Downtown Summerlin mall to walk and shop around!..."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 10 times already so I think it's safe to say that I love Zaba's. I've ordered both Bowls and Burritos. My usual order is Cilantro Lime Rice, Sweet Potato, either Carnitas or Beef, Medium Salsa, Sour Cream & Cheese. I also order a Side of Chips, which has a hint of salt & lime, for 99cents! Can't go wrong with that.  If you come as often as I do, it could come off a little pricey but I love the food and it's worth trying once, especially if you enjoy Mexican food. I think of it as a healthier version of Chipotle."}
{"text":"Truly delicious. Always goes there for the burritos! Im anxious to try the bowls which i heard really really good. And , i love good food"}
{"text":"I've been eating here frequently for a couple of years.  I like this location of all the ones I've been to in town.  It is fast and tastey.  They give generous portions and I appreciate the brown rice and whole wheat tortilla options.  I usually get a salad because it comes with guacamole and sour cream included in the price."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, and a tasty burrito. I think mine was the Classic. Cost less than $8. Got it to go!"}
{"text":"I go to Zaba's so often that they know who I am, so I consider myself an expert.  The restaurant is always clean, even behind the counter.  Service is quick (as it should be) and the staff members are always happy to help.  It never feels fake or forced, and I always enjoy our chit-chat.  It's the Subway of Mexican food, so there's not a TON to say about it, but I can definitely recommend it.  Clean establishment, quick service, good prices, and delicious food.  One of my regular haunts!"}
{"text":"We finally tried this Mexican restaurant located in the Plaza Hotel downtown - food court. I have to say we have walked by this many times in the past with no customers in site so we never tried it. I feel like no one really knows it's back there?! First visit (sorry forgot to take pictures) ordered a shredded beef burrito with white rice, veggies, pico, cheese and sour cream. This was absolutely delicious. The flavors were point on and the burritos are pretty huge. We also tried a fish taco I thought the $4+ was a little steep BUT after having it I would of paid more. That as well, so good and fresh! The fish was flaky and a big piece I was impressed. I ordered the way it was listed on the board and I wouldn't change. Everyday since we tried it just a week ago I had been craving it... so last night made another trip. This time I tried a chicken taco and a beef taco in flour shell (this is what is listed in the picture) on them I added white rice, pico, cheese and sour cream. I also ordered a small side of Guac which will be a must for me now on! I can say as of now the shredded beef is my go to but I'm also a shredded beef lover and this place really makes me love it! Just like the first visit it was same quality and was just as delicious. I agree with other people comments it is much better than Chipotle and seems better priced. They have other items on their menu besides tacos and burritos and I'm pretty excited to try more. So if you're in the mood for fast Mexican where you can see it made right in front of you with a decent price tag you should TRY THIS PLACE! The staff here are also friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"The food in this location is excellent I actually prefer it over Chipotle! The only reason I give it 3 stars is it has a very foul odor in the restaurant. It almost smells like they have a sewer leak."}
{"text":"Had to post an old photo! I love coming to eat all the time, however I was sad to come in and know they didn't have the elotes! While pregnant I always crave street made elotes! And this place was always closer to my work place! Elotes should be year round not just the summer, please reconsider! But I still recommend the rest of the food it's always delicious and the staff are amazing always kind and the place is always clean! Ariana is the sweetest tho!"}
{"text":"Waaaaaaaaaay over priced from what they used to be.  Without telling you, they nickle and dime you with up sells that can double the price of your order."}
{"text":"Quick stop for 3.99 tacos and beer -- good in a pinch but the tacos were cold.  Good safety comes into question... When you're serving cold meat.   Thanks for the beer!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Zabas restuarant to sit and eat! The people are always gratefull upon entering. The place is always clean and the food is always extra good! My kids love the brownies!"}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I've checked in. WAY more flavor than Chipotle. That's the reason I come here. Order a side of chipotle ranch with everything, it's good stuff!"}
{"text":"good food, burrito was huge, tasty and the prices are fair, clean store, friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This restaurant is by my place and I was hungry, so I went. To put it bluntly, go here for the food- not the service.  For me, service is the number one thing to look for in a restaurant. I liked the food.  The nachos were excellent.  I just did not care for the service.  Very rude service.  They got the extra star because the nachos were slightly above par."}
{"text":"Had to ask the lady mending the register to wash her hands since she had just finished counting change and decided she would just put some gloves on without washing first.  The owner and manager need to teach their employees proper hand washing techniques.  This is why people get sick and get food poisoning.  After I asked her politely to was her hands, another employee came in and they started talking bad about me in Spanish, I speak Spanish and people need to learn to not make assumptions since most think I'm not Hispanic.  Very disappointed at the quality of customer service, I love the food and I came to this location since I was visiting a friend but I live very far from it and have only been to the location in Henderson.  I work with the public on a daily bases and we have to make sure hand washing is done prior to wearing gloves before working on someone, but it seems that in a food place that is not being followed as it should.  This place needs to have the health department come show them the proper way."}
{"text":"Zabas is really good. Better than chipotle any day! I Got 2 zabas \"bowls\" to go yesterday. The bowl isn't a bowl anymore it's a square and it's made of hard \"cardboard\" so by the time u get home the bottom of the squared bowl is really soft. Also this new squared bowl seems smaller. Zabas is good and has always been worth the price because of their big portions but this new bowl is def smaller. Other than food is great."}
{"text":"Disappointing! I should've left as soon as I saw the old dried up crusty beans, but I decided to give it a try without the beans & I love beans. :( The chicken burrito was not the business & the guacamole was so bland. I will never return to this place."}
{"text":"I really like this Zabas. I think I've only been there once when it's been really busy, but my food has always been really good. I prefer this over chipotle because I get at least another meal out of a bowl order. I also suggest trying the queso, or get nachos!"}
{"text":"It's fast casual Mexican grill that's between chipotle and café rio. A nice change up if you get tired of always visiting chipotle. I like the fact that there are sauté bell peppers and onions to add to our salad and the gauc was included. Good little place near our home. Got to stop by and try it. When you see postal carriers and metro stop in for lunch you know it has to be some what good. The quesadilla is killer tasty."}
{"text":"I thought that when ordering food at Zaba's Mexican Grill, I would at least get a passable version of Chipotle. NO! This place was awful! The burrito bowl managed to have little to no taste, and the meat was not seasoned well at all. Trot on over to an actual Chipotle instead, because at least you will have consistently good meats and large portions for the same price. The only good thing about my meal were the chips, because I got a free bag with a coupon.   The only seasoning I tasted was me being SALTY about not getting a better lunch somewhere else.  Food: 1, Service: 2, Environment: 3, Price: 2"}
{"text":"I have eaten here before for breakfast and another trip I went there for lunch. Both times there I have enjoy it both times. They are in an area where there is a McDonald's but there line is always slow. Zaba's is fast, friendly, and enjoyable place to have a meal. I will be back to this place."}
{"text":"I'm sad - I have to write that the food at Zaba's was horrible. Dry, stale, withered were the fittest words to describe their food.  As much as I wanted to support a local business, I can't just blindly support anything... Simply put, Chipole is better."}
{"text":"Really liked it. It's like a chipotle with better choices and was freaky fresh.  Thought it had better flavor and they were just as fast as chipotle."}
{"text":"Before heading out on a road trip to AZ on a Sunday, the topic of where to eat before we headed out came up.  I finally decided I had grudged ZMG for long enough and so it was recommended to the GF and BOY who were happy with the choice.  It seems things have changed since I was last here.  Rather than having to pick this and that for your burrito or Zaba Bowel, they have choices on the menu which include a combination of ingredients thus eliminating any indecision.  I went with a surf and turf (steak & shrimp) burrito.  I found the ingredients to fresh and a compliment to each other.  There as cheese, guacamole, hot sauce, pico, potatoes.  When we all sat down, i enjoyed watching everyone enjoy there meal.  I must say I truly enjoyed mine.  The service was quick and efficient not to mention (based on previous review) there were no DB's within eyeshot."}
{"text":"It's like chipotle but I don't know which one came first. Well that doesn't matter and the only important thing is the food is good. They do have more choices than a chipotle and 2 items that come to mind are quesadillas and nachos. If you like assembly line burritos give it a try."}
{"text":"Awesome. Fish Tacos are the best in the city. The rest of the food is addictive and healthy. I eat there all of the time. The service is typically great and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Always understaffed... always out of chicken staff is more concerned with their personal conversations in the kitchen then doing their jobs. Looking for a new Zabas to go to... Ugh"}
{"text":"they charged my debit card 22 times in the same day( over $600.00)  and when i called the payment system CLEARENT  they blew me off! so next step is filing a bank fraud  claim  with my bank WELLS FARGO!  game on ! bring cash if you EAT HERE! WHEN YOU CALL THE RESTAURANT THEY SAY IM SORRY!   WTF!  UPDATE the bank reimbursed my account Wells Fargo. Clearent gave us a gift card but when we attempted to use it at Zabas on Wed  Jan 10th. They said can't use gift cards. LOL"}
{"text":"Great prices. Nice portion. Healthy ingredients. Salad is what I get. Love that it comes with guacamole! Perfect when I crave Mexican but want it healthy!"}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this Zaba's on Fridays during lent for my usual shrimp salad. Each visit has been consistently good! The food is food and has consistent good taste. On today's visit, the manager, Maria, was helping the line and she was very friendly and nice, which is always a plus. A co-worker was with me and we both ordered our shrimp at the same time because last week they had run out of the prepared shrimp, so we had to wait for it to grill. She said that she was on top of it this week and made sure that each store had enough fish ready at lunch time. And she definitely didn't skimp on the shrimp! The reason for four stars and not five is that I do feel sometimes they do skimp on the shrimp and that $9.50 for a salad that is a tad on the small is a bit steep. But I don't eat here daily. Other than that, the service is always great, the food is always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Food. Yum. Belly. Full.  Those were my key takeaways after I gobbled down a delicious burrito at lunch. My choices included: whole wheat tortilla, black beans brown rice, spicy salsa, and fish. Normally when I go after \"alternative\" tastes, they never come out the way I had hoped, but I came out on top with this combo.  The food was prepared quickly. Think of it like a Chipotle with a more diverse menu. Shrimp, Fish are options. Quesadillas, nachos and salads are on the menu here as well.  The restaurant was clean, the food was tasty.   I should also mention that Coke Zero is available in the fountain. Another big plus.  I prefer this place over it's similar competitor: Chipotle. Just because of the menu variety.   I'm done."}
{"text":"Started going to Zaba's before I ever heard or had eaten at a Chipolte.  When I had finally eaten initially there was some similarity.  But over the years I think Zaba's has taken off as it's own Mexican Grill and not the knockoff that some I have head said.  The meat and veggies are fresh.  Everything for the fish tacos to the burrito and bowls is great!    They did serve a breakfast for awhile that was incredible!  Unfortunately the lack of breakfast burrito bowl eaters caused it to go away.  The ladies at this location are also very nice."}
{"text":"A male employee on the line started making my burrito. I ordered the shredded beef, and he used the tongs to scoop the meat and placed it in the burrito. He then proceeded to take off a sizable portion of the meat off the rice and beans and back into the tray. I told him I had just worked out and would like the full scoop/portion. He put it back on and said he was going to charge me extra. The female employee chimed in saying it was one scoop per burrito and I explained I had only one scoop and before he removed some.  After this I left to go eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Got 2 tacos and a beer for 4 bucks, so you can't beat that. It was pretty tasty, and it's very similar to Chipotle but offers street tacos, breakfast burritos, and quesadillas. Ingredients seemed pretty fresh as well."}
{"text":"Service : The ladies taking our orders did not speak English. No napkins or utensils were given to us as well."}
{"text":"Ok so while I was living near here at 215 and flamingo I used to get zabas probably three times a week, was it healthy? No. Was it delicious? You bet! I still am tempted to go on my way out of the gym sometimes, and I still often stop in and get a burrito. Heres a tip from an experienced patron, get chipotle ranch instead of sour cream. Sour cream has no flavor, trust me you will be glad you opted for the chipotle ranch. Also the sweet potatoes are excellent! I highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"I love Zaba's! The only thing that is stopping me from giving 5 stars is that it is a knock off version of Chipotle.  Food tastes good and it is easy and quick to get in and out. Prices could be better but overall it's not a place to complain about!"}
{"text":"Chipotle style bowls, too bad they charge extra for extra salsa and food it's kind of cold."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service. I like the fact that they have BOTH wheat tortillas and brown rice options. Haven't had a bad experience there yet."}
{"text":"Really good. They charge for everything though. Some of their portions are a little skimpy in my opinion. It's my second time, so obviously it didn't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"I stopped by this restaurant after work for a quick dinner pick up. I had initially called in to place a phone order, but wS rudely notified they do not take orders over the phone. Where do I start.. it's a chipotle style set up in regards to ordering. The struggle came in when none of the people preparing the food understood what I asked them for. I have a hard time understanding why when they're literally putting the toppings on as you move along the service counter. The shrimp was decent, but the beef was not good...at all. I ordered a shrimp bowl, which was enough for two meals and the steak tacos. I had asked for salsa on the side since it was a to go order, but was sad to see i never received it. Because the food was mediocre and the employees were quite rude, I likely won't come back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Far better than Chipotle. Food is so fresh and tasty!! I love that they have shrimp, as well as, all the typical choices. Service is fast and friendly!! My next party will definitely be catered from here."}
{"text":"Try all your favorite fillings on the salad.    I love being able to eat outside on a pleasant day.  Zabas is a great place to have a healthy lunch and do just that.  Today I tried the Steak Salad with grilled vegetables and the various toppings.  It meets the diet I am on.  The hard part is walking away from the fresh tortillas and chips.  But today there was just enough will power to do that.     Quick, healthy and peaceful lunch."}
{"text":"So I went into Zaba's for the first time in a long time. I bought some food for a friend and I. With that food I bought some sour cream, there is barely any sour cream in the bowl. On top of that, they rung me up for guacamole, which cost me more then the 99cent sour cream. I called the store to just say \"hey, what gives?\" Instead and an explanation, the girl that answered the phone told me she would get a supervisor. The supervisor came on the phone, I told her what happened, and then she told me sorry I didn't hear you and want to me to repeat everything all over again. Her name was Cele... She cared so little but she didn't even take the time to explain why I paid $1.59 for a guacamole when in actuality I bought sour cream. I usually don't leave reviews and this'll be my first one on yelp. I just could not stand the fact that this supervisor, employee, store charged me for something I didn't pay for. I honestly never even would've looked at the receipt, and saw that they charge me more money than I should've been charge for, if it wasn't for the sour cream that was hardly even there."}
{"text":"Delicious tortilla chips and guac! I've had the carne asada quesadilla as well. The steak was nice and tender and well marinaded. A little more pricey than your typical robertos/faustos/amigos but it is a nice change when you're craving the freshest ingredients and a nice atmosphere to dine in."}
{"text":"Nice option for fast fresh Mex food. Grab starters like their Zabapeno balls or the queso blanco with light salty chips like we did. Create your meal by selecting grilled steak, chicken, shredded beef, pork carnitas or lime Chipotle shrimp or fish. Then add the typical  toppings or sides to create a bowl, burrito, tacos, or other dishes.   If you don't feel up to fashioning your own meal, there are Zaba specials, too. My guy ordered the fish tacos trio on corn tortillas. He was hungry to begin with, but the tacos were hefty enough to have him say \"no mas\" after devouring only two tacos.  My hand picked bowl of grilled steak with brown rice, black beans, fajitas veggies, salsa, cheese and sour cream hit the hunger spot, too.  The wait was short when we arrived, but stretched to the door after we sat down. Fortunately, the line moved quickly with friendly service.   Again, nice option, nothing fancy, but satisfying."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Zaba's since November but somehow they charged my account SIX times for different amounts on January 2!! Employees must be stealing credit card numbers, what else would explain this? I'm never going here again and I'm filing a complaint with headquarters. You've been warned!"}
{"text":"Cool and overcast day, perfect for people watching on their patio.  Their menu board offers lots of ways to customize your meal and since I felt like having a protein based dish, the Zaba Bowl sans rice worked for me!  Carnitas, black beans, fajita veggies with all the toppi gs.  Quick and easy in and out, nutrition to get the energy up to get the shopping done."}
{"text":"So I started coming here because my bf loves this place.... Well he started to love this place after all those health code issues at Chipotle which used to be his favorite.   Anyhow, everytime I've been here, it has been clean and with all those windows is always bright and feels cheerful to me. So I give them a (5/5) for the ambiance. :)  Service is mostly good but then again I've never come when it's busy.  Actually it never does seem busy even if I do come at normal dinner times. I guess that's a good thing for me! Lol. But it off the numerous times I've been here.... There have been a few times with bad service where the staff was just very inattentive. (4/5)  The food to me is very much chipotle style. U get in a line and you order what you want and then u get to watch them make your dish.  Overall it's a decent place. The flavor of the chicken is off and on.  Sometimes it is so very flavorful and other times it's a little on the bland side. I guess it depends of who is seasoning it and grilling it. :/. There have been a few times where they have run out of ingredients at around 7 pmish.... Not sure how you could run out of crispy taco shells.  They have also run out of brown rice on occasion.... So minus 1 star for not stocking food items properly. Minus .5 star for inconsistency.  The Zalapeno balls are yummilicious! I get them everytime i go. It's got a crispy skin and the flavor of the jalapeno mixed with the potato is so delicious in the creamy center!! (3.5/5)  Overall am I going to return.... That would be a positive as....uuummm... Read my opening line....my bf loves this place. Lol it's decent and the zalapeno balls are delicious and my favorite thing on the menu! :)"}
{"text":"Always a 5 star experience - all of the ladies at this location are fast professional and friendly!! I refer people here all the time.. get the surf n turf burrito"}
{"text":"Another Chipotle knock off, expensive for what you get and food wasn't very good. Customer service was excellent by the staff that was behind the counter"}
{"text":"When I'm willing to splurge on calories this is my go to lunch! It's right across from my school and the burritos are HUGE! The line at noon often goes out the door. The rice, beans, and toppings are always fresh and tasty. My only complaint is that they don't mix up the what you choose so you'll get a bite that's all one ingredient, like guacamole or just rice. I'm vegan and appreciate that the black beans and brown rice are safe for me !"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with the customer service. I've been coming to this location for the past few years as well as been apart of the loyalty program. They recently changed their rewards system and didn't honor my FREE meal which I had EARNED from previous transactions. The cashier was not friendly nor accommodating. Since the free meal wasn't honored I asked for the 10% discount for LVAC members in which she still didn't want to honor because it was \"free chips and salsa day\" and she could give out \"free food\". I wrote to management/corporate the same day and have yet to receive a response regarding the matter.  While the food is good, zabas is more expensive than chipotle and the customer service definitely needs some help. It's poor customer service to not honor a reward that has been earned by a \"loyal member\". I'm a big fan of customer service so unfortunately they lost me as a customer. They've made it clear to me they don't value their customers because 1. The situation would have been rectified before I walked out the door and 2 someone would have contacted me by now regarding my complaint! It's pretty unfortunate because the food is great!"}
{"text":"I have tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt several times. The flavor of the food is good, no doubt about that. On 5-23-2013 I ate here with my son once again after approximately a year. They were short staffed, the poor guy who seemed like he was a supervisor was very nice, appologetic and worked as quickly as possible, great job there. Now for the food: WHAT A RIP OFF, they put about a tablespoon worth of chicken in my burrito. I said, \"Could you spare it?' Sarcastically of course, he relented and gave me a little more. I have been in the restaurant business for many years, yes, he is entitled to a profit, however, the cost to put a generous or fair amount of chicken in the burrito is minimal. At $7 a burrito he is making a huge profit with those portions. I don't think I will go back now, I have given them enough chances. For the rest of you suckers, pay attention to what they are doing. The only reason that I gave them two stars is because they do have good tasting food. After reading some,  other reviews I wanted to add to it. In one review it was mentioned at how much he was charged for a side of sour cream, once again, they are entitled to a profit, and like myself when they first opened, I used to eat there 2 to 3 times a week and then they nickle and dime you. COME ON YOU SEE A PATRON IN YOUR ESTABLISHMENT MORE THAN A FEW TIMES A WEEK, TAKE CARE OF THEM. WATCH FARRELL'S OLD TRAINING VIDEO CALLED, \"GIVE EM THE PICKLE\""}
{"text":"Like this way better than chipotle. And they have shrimp which is a big plus. I love their bowls here and they have better options here as well. Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"i ordered the $5 lunch special of potato tacos which was just horrible.. i ordered green salsa and pico ..somehow was forgotten when i opened my lunch it was some spicy red salsa.. i dont know how you confuse red with green and their was barely any potatos it looked like they had used frozed hash brown strings with no salt or pepper. it was just horrible!"}
{"text":"And who wouldn't want to eat at a restaurant where Paul Shortino and Carrot Top go .Burrito ' s the size of your arm and 3 fish tacos that are no problem to stick away, great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Yuck.. The beans are hard, the meat is seasoned badly and whoever is making the rice can't tell when it's done. I can't think of one positive thing about this restaurant.  The food was just bad and I never want to eat here again."}
{"text":"I love me some Zabas! I tell any who will listen to me that Chipo#!$@&3 place they will never stop there again after trying Zabas. Burritos to die for and fish tacos ..... Don't even get me started on how good the fish tacos are. Oh and if you are smart enough to stop in on Friday Saturday or Sunday you can try the Shrimp Ceviche OMG."}
{"text":"Lady with pony tail and braid in her hair legit dragged my tortilla across the entire counter. Absolutely disgusting I almost didn't even buy the thing but it was for my sister. Someone needs to call the health inspector on these people. Every table was dirty and I didn't see anyone clean anything for the 30 minutes I was in there. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SERVICE."}
{"text":"I really like Zaba's - I had the buritto bowl last night.  The line moves fast.  You get nice size portions.  Everything is fresh.  It's very clean and the service is always nice.  I enjoy their buritto bowl over Chipotle."}
{"text":"Good, but not worth the price. How do you charge an extra $1.79 for chicken in a kids meal? There is probably 7 chunks of chicken. Then if you want corn that's an extra .99 cents too. Really?"}
{"text":"Decent knock off of Chipotle. Same set up, basically the same menu, and eerily similar décor. I do like that they have a few outside seating options. Really dislike driving in that part of town though, since it's so congested. But if I'm already over here, I'll keep it in mind for lunch or dinner.  Stopped by prior to a recent training at the GATE center. Opted for the carnitas burrito bowl with brown rice, black beans, extra grilled veggies, light sour cream and guac, pico and corn salsa, cheese, and tons of lettuce. Essentially I wanted more of a salad, really. Portion was huge. Also added on a completely unnecessary, overpriced, and way-too-big side of queso.   Got my order to go and munched through my meeting. Like, I said, it was a huge portion, and I saved it for a lunch the next day. Not bad for the price, I guess, though it's not exactly inexpensive. Good value, I guess.  Flavors were okay. For so many varied ingredients, I expected it to taste a little better but everything kind of melted together, especially when some of the cheese was added in. I really liked the plentiful grilled veggies, but the bowl was pretty one-note. Maybe an extra side of another salsa would have added some acidity? Or some lime/cilantro? I don't know. Not bad, but not four-stars worthy.  Service was lacking. I walked in and there were three guys in the kitchen portion who just stared at me for a minute. Finally one came around to help me but didn't seem to speak much English. A girl walked up at one point and he simply walked away, leaving her to finish my order. She didn't seem to be too confident in how to work the register, but did ask if I had one of their loyalty cards and explained how they worked."}
{"text":"Watch out, Chipotle!!!!   WHY don't we have any Zaba's in San Diego?????  It's basically a Chipotle - looks, architecture, food choices and preparation and all, except for these very important points, which bring Zaba's above par: They have great whole wheat tortillas as an option; They have brown rice as well as white rice; Their red salsa kicks butt; They make their burritos HUGE; They have a breakfast menu; They have fish tacos They have Coke Zero Need I say more?  My only gripe is that our \"server/burrito maker\" obviously hated her job, and was downright depressing, but the food was tasty and filling and affordable.  Yum!"}
{"text":"This a great option for me because it's right by my house and the service is always quick. I used to get the burritos but I usually end up not eating it all. The three tacos are a much better option and they don't leave me feeling stuffed. Which is a good thing. The staff is always very friendly and I am in and out quickly. Love the online ordering too!"}
{"text":"Love the salad (chicken/beans/rice/avocado/lettuce/cheese) .  So fresh.  Small staff and a little slow and not consistent. Sometimes I get just enough chicken and sometimes they barely put any on.  Need to improve on that.  The staff is friendly.  Prices are okay.  We visit once a week for take-out."}
{"text":"Not familiar with the chain, but at this location it's very lacking. Went for breakfast and regretted my choice. The mcd's next door would've been a better choice. Food was poorly prepared and ingredients missing. Biggest regret was the price, for what I paid, compared to what's served, does not balance out."}
{"text":"Bought a salad bowl from ZABAS Mexican grill off Flamingo 215 and there was a rock in it! My mom almost broke her teeth and she was sharing it with my 2 year old daughter. I called to speak with owner or manager and no one spoke English. They couldn't even understand what I was trying to communicate. They said they would give my number to a manager and I have yet to hear anything. Saving the salad and rock and contacted the food and drug administration. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Pretty good burrito. The hot salsa was very good. The weren't busy when we got there so some of the ingredients had been sitting out for awhile."}
{"text":"This place feels like a rip-off of Chipotle right down to the tables and signs...Just like Chipotle, it has an aluminum interior with the same browns, same looking booths, and the same way that Chipotle sells its burritos...The only difference is, its higher prices, more selection of drinks, and the decision of white or brown rice and whole-wheat or flour tortilla...The food was ok, I think Chipotle is better, but Zaba's was pretty much the only place open in the parking lot at 10:50 AM..."}
{"text":"A-OK is accurate.  I love that they have whole wheat tortillas and brown rice available :) The cilantro lime shrimp were very tasty!"}
{"text":"It depend of the daily mood of the Mexican servers. They are very selective regarding customers so the portion will according to that."}
{"text":"This place beats qdoba and chipotle on taste and if that wasn't reason enough to come here I also come because I can get brown rice and wheat tortilla which is not an option at their competitor's spots."}
{"text":"The food is always good and fresh here. It's a little in the pricey side but the VIP card is nice. Buy 10 and get one free.  The only issues I have is with the staff. I recently arrived at 10:27 (they open at 10:30 and the front door was open). The lady yelled, \"we're not open yet\", ran to the door and locked it as if I was trying to rob the place. I had to stand outside for 3 minutes till they opened. Then she came to the door and unlocked it and walked away never acknowledged to me that they were open and I can come in.... Service is hit and miss here sometimes....sigh..."}
{"text":"Not bad, Zaba's!  I pass this place almost every day, as it is close to my gym, but I've never stopped to eat here. Today I decided to bite the bullet (or the burrito, as it were), and give it a shot.    This place is kind of like the Subway of Mexican food. You pick your type of food (burrito/bowl), the type of wrapping (flour or corn tortilla), the meat you want, and they'll slide you on down the line as you pick your fixings.  I decided on a chicken burrito with a flour tortilla. I particularly appreciated that beans were not mandatory on my burrito and that sour cream was not extra.  All in all, it was pretty good. I felt like they were a little skimpy on the chicken, but all of the fixings were tasty and it was a sizable enough burrito. One thing that needed improvement was that it wasn't very hot. I am one of those people who likes my food piping hot, and this was just warm at best. The corn salsa also has lots of cilantro, just an FYI.  Service was very quick and friendly, and the cost for the burrito was $7.59 (including tax)."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. Wonderful service. Very well decorated & very clean. My fish tacos were delicious. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Really good food, better then chipotle. And I Love chipotle. First time here, really good food and service!"}
{"text":"Zaba's is great for lunch.  I love supporting local business (when they're worth it) and this one definitely is!  The Flamingo location has a great staff and is always on the ball.  I highly recommend this place.  They get four stars because it's a little small, and frequently during lunch it's next to impossible to find a seat.  The hot salsa is also unpredictable.  You have to get it on the side, test it out, and eat accordingly.  Sometimes it's INSANE hot, and other times not so much..."}
{"text":"This place is like chipotle 2.0.   Same layout, same flavors generally, except their hot sauces aren't as good.   I think the prices are similar as well.   Wish I took a picture of the menu so I could say that for sure.  Flavors are good, I haven't seen a line like chipotle, and nice portions.     I always take my food to go but the place is clean and plenty of seats.   Those real soda heads out there knows that soda quality varies big time at different places.   The soda here is on point.   For reals."}
{"text":"Very unfriendly staff and the chicken is is gross. I got more fat and weird pieces of dark meat than I did the eatable pieces. Very disappointed as this was my first time here. If I ever return it will be to try the shrimp"}
{"text":"Great food!! Forget Chipotle! You can taste the freshness in every bite. Everything tastes just like home cooking. This is the place you want to come if you want fast food but also want real food! Bryan is the best! He's really polite & an artist at what he does. Everyone is really great here!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE ... EVER! Very RUDE employees. This place has got to be one of the absolute WORST food experiences I have had. I ordered a steak quesadilla and a steak burrito. Although the food tasted fine, they're service is why i will NEVER go back. 1st they didn't ask what I wanted on my quesadilla just made it then told me they couldn't add anything, then took 5 minutes to comprehend that I wanted 2 orange juices and a gatorade. cost $31. We ate there then when I asked for a to go box they told me I wasn't allowed to have one even though i spent $31 on food there. I also had to wait for them to stop just conversating with another spanish woman who didn't buy anything just so that they could ring me up. They were irritated just by the presence of customers and just don't give a shit about anything but gossipping to themselves in spanish while customers wait to order."}
{"text":"I really love their shrimp tacos. A bit pricey that can go up to $10 for 3 pieces but put some lime on it and green salsa, OMG that's heaven in your mouth."}
{"text":"Most of the time it's pretty good. Today I ordered a mango Zaba Rita. When it came out red I asked the girl behind the counter if it was Mango and she said, no we don't have that. Wouldn't that be helpful before it was ordered. If you don't have something don't let people order it or take it off the menu."}
{"text":"Friendly staff :)  been coming to this location for more than a year. There food is always tasty. Clean, and fast in and out. The portion of the meal is very big. Normally it will takes me 2 mean to finish 1 order. I recommend the salad bowl, it pretty much come with everything and no extra charge for guacamole. Steak and chicken are both very tender, I often order half and half.  My husband always order a side of tortilla so he will wrap the salad inside the tortilla like a burritos"}
{"text":"Food is super bomb. Definitely come here before going to any other build-your-own meal type Mexican restaurant. Employees are always very friendly and helpful. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"We eat there ALL THE TIME and could go there everyday. Their bowls are the best. Matter of fact, I have leftovers for lunch today. Super glad they're a block from home too! They're so much better than Chipotle!!! You get so much for the $$$$. The Summerlin location @ the mall is my favorite one."}
{"text":"2 tacos and 1 drink for $5 is literally the best. Their street tacos are pretty good and their service is always great! We go at least once a week for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is gross. Go to chipotle instead. Food was cold and pricey. Nasty. And watch out: the red salsa is too spicy to eat"}
{"text":"Nothing surprising, food is mediocre, combined with a terrible attitude from the staff. Never coming back, Chipotle rip-off but worse. Ordered the grilled chicken tacos and the tortilla was awful..."}
{"text":"Probably the worst burrito and bowl i have eaten in my life. I have no idea how a place this terrible get such high reviews. Ive been here twice and each time regretted why on earth i chose to. Taco bell or any fast food chain is better than what this place has to offer. Upon my first visit i tried there burrito. The tortilla they had gave me was ice cold as if it had just came out the refrigerator. It had a dry and chewy consistency, and the chicken was as bland as cardboard, i had to drown my meal in hot sauce just to eat it. The beans were extremely liquidly and after taking the first bite all fell out of the burrito ( not to mention it was poorly wrapped). The next time i came here i got a bowl, i figured theres no tortilla, they cant really mess that up but boy was i wrong, same problem with the chicken and it was still cold, i didn't even finish i had a few bites and threw it away. All i can say is that I'm never eating here again."}
{"text":"Was surprised to find this gem across the street from Macy's. The interior was modern and clean with this awesome looking reclaimed wood on one wall. Looks like a chipotles with even the same type of menu. That is until you bite into the food. I had the Zaba bowl with chicken. My friend had it with the steak.   The marinade on the chicken made it tender and gave it a killer taste. I tried the steak that almost melted in my mouth. We topped our meal off with a home made brownie.   The staff was friendly and awesome. A breathe of fresh air. If you get hungry shopping, you have to stop in here. If I ever come back to the mall I will make this a stop."}
{"text":"Omg they give out toppings like they are going out of business and trying to make their last bits of food last.  I feel like I'm being rationed.  What the heck, how much can beans and rice really cost!?"}
{"text":"Love Zabas..... way better than Chipotle. .... I goto the one on South Durango. .... all I can say is yummy!"}
{"text":"Visited on 10/9/2014  Food: I would say average Mexican food spot, in direct competition with Chipotle. I ordered a chicken bowl with guac. Delicious, but nothing to write home about. I still don't know if I like this place more than Chipotle, but it's worth a shot if you've never had them.  Service: Service was good, as it was opening day. The lunch crowd had made their way in and the line was starting to build up. I was greeted and handed a menu by a friendly woman upon entry. The cooking staff handled my order perfectly and the cashier attemped an upsell of chips, which I declined. All in all, pretty good service.  Decor: the establishment was clean and orderly despite being a bit busy on its first day. Indoor and outdoor seating is available. The outdoor seating is well set up, with infinite people-watching opportunities. exposed building elements inside add a nice touch."}
{"text":"You know you have a problem when you eat here 2-3 times a week. My husband and I have been coming here for years, not only because of their food but because of their service. Everyone who works at this location are extremely nice and very efficient. They can get busy at times but the food makes it worth the wait. Don't forget to get the Zabas point card. If you're a frequent visitor like me, the free burrito every once in a while makes you feel happy!"}
{"text":"Love the food.   Many times they are disorganized and sometimes short on food(not enough meat prepped).   The big bummer is they are extra super stingy on the sides(sour cream and such).  Sides barely half full. Whats the point?"}
{"text":"I came by Tuesday night and ordered three fish  tacos and two guacamole with chips. I have comp for 30 dollars and go to room and eat fish tacos and find no guacamole with the chips. I should of came back down and asked them for shortage. They had name on comp and could of called my room. If you go to the place make sure you audit your food BEFORE you leave."}
{"text":"The shrimp was going bad/fishy, the service was weird.. just go to Chipotle or Qdoba where there's consistency. Or support a mom and pop shop, the ones who need your business the most."}
{"text":"Zaba's is close to my work, and I go here fairly often for lunch. I really like Zaba's quesadillas. They come with a big side of guac, sour cream, and salsa (I suggest the tomatillo salsa). It's always yummy. I'm not a huge fan of the burritos as I don't like rice in them. You can get it without the rice, but then your burrito is really thin as they don't put anything in to replace the rice. The tacos are pretty decent. My suggestion: Get the quesadilla, skip the burrito."}
{"text":"Big veggie burrito is very good & for only $8.49 Inside the Plaza casino & hotel. Friendly workers & pub table seating."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience. I called yesterday for a last minute taco bar catering order for a family gathering. The gathering was starting in two hours. I arrived on time. I had to wait a short amount of time ( less than 15 mins). They were apologetic but, given the short notice it was completely understandable. The food was flavorful and fresh. After we had left the restaurant we were called and informed that they had not given us enough tortillas. They quickly remedied the problem by having an employee drive to our home to deliver the tortillas along with some extra queso for the inconvenience. Given this experience, I would definitely order from the catering menu again."}
{"text":"This place blows away competitors. Served completely fresh, no freezers. They also have deals for kids eating free on Sunday's. They now serve cocktails too. They have a two street taco and beer deal for $5service is always on point and the restaurant is always clean. Best 10 dollar quick meal in Henderson."}
{"text":"This place has become my substitution for Chipotle. Their portions are huge compared to Chipotle's stingy potions. I'd rather go here, while Chipotle works out their food poisoning issues."}
{"text":"Similar to chipotle but it's better.  I had the Asada burrito and I ordered a single fish taco just to see what all the hype was about.  That fish taco was so delicious! No one serves you, so you order and get it at the spot! Come here if you're in a rush and are hungry for some Mexican Food."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest restaurant I have been to, but delicious. It was great to try a local chain while we were traveling. I really enjoyed adding potatoes to my delicious burrito."}
{"text":"Lots of mixed reviews on Zaba's ... I guess your experience may depend on what and when you order. I popped in here early on a Saturday morning looking for a quick breakfast that didn't have \"Mc\" in the title. Zaba's was open and serving breakfast burritos. And these were the real deal - reminding me of the great breakfast burritos I would get at Anita's in the DC area. Scrambled eggs, beans, potato, cheese, and salsa, and chorizo - oh MY! It was a very ample and tasty breakfast burrito, and it was around $3.50, which was entirely reasonable for what I got. I would come back here again if I am staying at The Plaza or Downtown."}
{"text":"It was my first time to Zabas and I had the salad option. Loads of toppings and meat options. Friendly staff and clean environment. Everyone was raving about the fish tacos but I didn't see it on the menu til I was paying so I will be back to try it next time!"}
{"text":"I eat at Zaba's about once a month after working out at LVAC.  It's in the same parking lot as the gym, but I also appreciate the healthier options that they provide...such as: Wheat tortillas  Brown rice SWEET POTATOES Grilled chicken/shrimp/fajita veggies   They are not my favorite Mexican grill flavor wise, but the food is all good, the service is fast & friendly, and I love the extra options."}
{"text":"I much prefer the location on flamingo and 215 because this location isn't quite together yet. For example today I went and found that they had run out of chicken. A few weeks ago I went and the woman behind the counter was kind of rude. The food doesn't taste as good and to be quite honest you have to ask for normal portions because they will only put a little bit of food on your plate. (I'm not greedy, but its true) I will continue to go to the flamingo and 215 location. My children and my boyfriend think the same thing"}
{"text":"I will NEVER eat here again! They charged my account 6 times in one day...over $140 worth! I called them and I was told that their bank \"had a glitch\" and duplicated charges. This wasn't a glitch! There were multiple transactions for various amounts."}
{"text":"By far the WORST customer service experience here. The supposedly manager \"Laura\" talks very badly in front of people in Spanish thinking people don't speak it.  If I could give 0 stars I totally would."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm being to harsh on this place, but as an Mexican this Chipotle like Mexican Grill crap insults me. The meat is meh at best and the rice and beans are horrendous (come on people! this is the foundation to Mexican food).  Proper Mexican food is made with fatty ass cheap meat with excessive seeasoning and about ten pounds of lard! That's the way my daddy did it and that's what keeps me coming for more. But seriously though, when it comes down to it the burrito itself might be good size and tasty in its own right but the price tag is way excessive and in all honesty with Mexican food their is sooo many mom and pop hole in the walls that will give you a much better product and for a much cheaper price."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. Better than Chipotle or Baja Fresh in price and flavor. Fantastic for a post-gym meal."}
{"text":"While typically a fan of quick Mexican food, Zabas is my least favorite of similar style eateries. The flavors are bland and leave little to want to go back. The one positive is their chips. They are very tasty. But if looking for this style of food I would look for Chipotle or Qdoba."}
{"text":"Following the model of Chipotle and Q'doba, Zaba's offer quick fresh Mexican food in large portions.  There is one difference that I think is key though, it's locally owned and operated.  I like knowing that, especially in Vegas where everything is big flashy and commercialized.  I've been to this location, and a few others around town many times.  The food is constantly fresh and affordable.  No matter if you get a bowl, burrito, salad or quesadilla you'll be happy with the result.  I understand it's not gourmet food, but for the price point, you're noting going to get more value and fresher food than from Zaba's.  Support Local!"}
{"text":"Came with the boyfriend to have lunch Sunday afternoon. I ordered a salad. I'm a HUGE Chipotle fan so I always rate my salads from places like this (aka Mexican American grill joints) based on what I like from chipotle. Anywho. I ordered a shredded beef salad and it was pretty delicious! The option of shredded cabbage was a big plus for me. If I was to combated it to chipotle it would say it tops it for sure."}
{"text":"Good food good service never busy. I always come here for the salad and the guac is a must."}
{"text":"Basically a locally owned \"chipotle\". It's not somewhere you'll be excited to go. But It's a good place to eat a healthier fast food lunch. It would be cooler if they took a gamble and made it into genuine Mexican flavor chipotle but it almost tastes exactly the same. Which is not a bad thing, everybody likes chipotle.  Nice Decor. Looks clean."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years. The people who used to work here were great, but it seems like in the past few months, there has been a big turnover and staff. The new staff are really slow and they can't seem to get your order correctly no matter how many times you tell them what you want. I'll still come here just because it's close to my house,  the food is fresh and it's fairly inexpensive, But not thrilled with the new employees."}
{"text":"I am not gonna lie this place is way awesome. I was totally surprised when m wife and I discovered it. We love chipotle and Cafe Rio but this place's salads beat any of those! Plus they dont charge extra for every little thing, not even guacamole! The people are just a fast and very nive and it is never packed. Go for sure! We had a great experience. Best thing about the salads, get the pesto lime sauce and sweet potato chips on it, to die for!"}
{"text":"Wow oh wow :) splendid service. The ladies working were welcoming, sweet and quick! 1st time visiting zabas and i am blown away. Kinda freakin out because i live across the street from this location. Fish taco was pretty damn delicious. Ceviche was not my own hehe buut was super fresh. Zalapeno balls were bombdiggity! The bowl that my babe got was amaze bomb. Cannot wait to catch my next craving for Zabas!"}
{"text":"Love love LOVE Zabas! I like that it's fast, local and fresh. The employees are efficient but friendly! The food is always delicious and consistent from one location to the next.  My personal favorite is a basic shredded beef bowl with brown rice and all the additional fixings. If I feel like something more I get their queso and chips. They are SO yummy!   Thank you Zabas!"}
{"text":"Zaba's is a good place for good, fast, fresh Ameri-Mexican food.  It's reminiscent of Chipotle, but it's actually been around a little longer.  It offers chicken, beef, carnitas, and veggie options in tacos, burritos, bowls, and enchiladas.  Their fish tacos are de-voon.  It'll take about half the time to get through as Chipotle, and you won't be giving your money to McDonald's.  Bonus!  You can eat off of a chicken or steak quesadilla with guacamole for approximately an ice age, and their corn salsa makes me weep with its perfection.  The chips can sometimes be a little stale (and holy crap do I love my chips, so that really sucks), but crunch them up into the Zaba bowl and it's all a-ok.  Seriously, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Zaba bowl is delicious every time and they make it so fast. Thank you to the two ladies who were there during closing!"}
{"text":"Very similar to Chipotles ! However, I think the main difference is food portion. Zabas gives youa bigger portion of any meat that you choose also the green tea is very good. Zabas has a bigger menu to choose from and if you like to get rewarded use the Zabas card and after the 10th meal you will get the next one FREE. I hope the my review help to make a good healthy choice.  Have a good one !"}
{"text":"I love zabas but one of the employees is as rude as possibly can be. She's a white girl with very strong eyebrows. She rushed us and spoke very rudely, horrible customer service."}
{"text":"I've been going to zabas for a while now and I absolute LOVE the food! Today I decided to head over after the gym and I ordered a burrito that was $13. In the middle of my burrito I noticed a hair sticking out. I pulled it out thinking it would just be a small piece but it was a full length piece of hair. Instead of asking for a refund, I asked if I could get something in replacement. (The girl gave me a really rude look and asked if I pulled the hair out as if I was lying, but that's beside the point) I got steak fries. Once again, there was a hair in my steak fries. A little bit shorter than the one before, but a hair nonetheless. I wasn't able to finish any of my food because I was disgusted.   Maybe they should enforce wearing hair nets instead of just hats."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat. I will drive out of my way to come to this particular zaba'sit's the best in town!  From the service to the food!"}
{"text":"Ah man,,  I love Mexican food soooo much and I not picky either but man I'm so disappointed in the prices and the add-on charges on the bill.  The quality of the food doesn't match the price.   Too expensive"}
{"text":"I love Zaba's! Their quesadillas are incredible, as well as their chips. Way better than Chipotle, in my opinion. The staff has been very friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place to go and will recommend to anyone.  The food is fresh and the staff is great.  I love their under $5.00 meals since I eat small portions.  Best elote corn I've had in my life."}
{"text":"Very happy with this lunch choice! Chicken burrito was DELISH & lots of flavor. Green salsa was tasty. Huge servings! Quiet atmosphere. Staff was friendly, funny & patient."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times before always ordered a bowl ... The review today is solely for the fish tacos ... My BFF had suggested them after the eastern location closed - so I drove to this one and it was totally worth it and I will Be back for these tacos !!! Plus $1.50 for chips n salsa can't beat it .. You get my vote too Zaba's"}
{"text":"Don't try the fish tacos. Dry and plain. I chose it because it said \"Voted best in Vegas\" but that's hard to believe. I eventually asked for limes and the pointed me out to where the lemons are... I follow her back to the cashier and it took them awhile to get it to me but whatever."}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative reviews. I love this place!! The staff was incredibly nice and the food was delicious. Puts Chipotle food to shame!  Chipotle's food was so very bland and tasteless and Zaba's was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Very good and quick food.  Guacamole is fresh and you get a choice of whole wheat or regular tortilla.  Nice service and very clean kitchen"}
{"text":"One of the best spots!! Fresh food ! Kids eat free on Sunday's Come here all the time."}
{"text":"A faithful interpretation of the San Francisco burrito style, but nothing overly amazing goes on here. Plus for having whole wheat tortillas, brown rice and Veggie options."}
{"text":"Ouch, what happened in a year? The food is pretty dry, rice is horrible and bland, guacamole became watery! What a pity, it use to be better than chipotle..."}
{"text":"The food was okay, and their methods of attracting business are questionable.  We received a Zabas coupon in the mail which stated, \"Buy 2 entrees and 2 drinks and receive 50% off your order.\"  So, I'm thinking one drink and one entree free.  Not so.  When I got to the register, she says it's 50% off only one entree.  Period.  So what I thought would be a $10 lunch for two of us turned out to be $17.  I argued with the woman, as did several other customers trying to use the same coupon, to no avail.  I told her I'd never come back...and I meant it.  Food wasn't that great to begin with.  Oh, and she overcharged me on top of it.  Only .20 but I didn't notice until I got home.  Qdoba is a much better choice."}
{"text":"So the food here is awesome, i like it much better then chipotle. So i would give a 5 star there. But the people there are just horrible. We go and they charge extra for queso and extra cheese.. thats fine, but add the extra cheese. not 1/4 serving of it. Most of the servers are so stingy. We usually get no cheese on one meal and no lettuce on the other. We ask that they put the cheese on my meal... nope.. put the lettuce on her meal... nope.. There is such a huge difference in portions when we go depending on who is serving. idgaf what the end meal cost me, but if i want extra cheese and queso then add it. im paying for it. And the look you get if you say can you put more meat, lettuce, sour cream or anything just ruins the experience."}
{"text":"Customer service pays attention to detail of each meal they make, love it when they ask question and when we get answers. Shrimp and chicken white rice black beans cheese and lettuce burrito, omg! to die for, and left overs to die again later . all 4 my kids look forward to coming here, thats hard to please, thank you carlos and crew keep up the good work, we appreciate you ."}
{"text":"I got charged $210 instead of $21 on my meal. It's a good thing I noticed before I signed the merchant copy on my debit card. The fact that I didn't get an apology or even compensate my food is frustrating. The food is great, but just warning to always double check the amount you're charged for like I did here."}
{"text":"This Zaba's is always clean! The young lady with the beautiful gap toothed smile is always so nice, and greets you like your the only customer she's serving even if there's a line. The food is always fresh and the portions very generous. We love the fish tacos. Perfect SoCal style."}
{"text":"Been going here for years and honestly I really appreciate the fact that they give you the option between a whole wheat or white tortilla. It really makes life that much better. It's fast and healthy depending on what you order! Their hot sauce is bomb as well as their guacamole and quesadillas."}
{"text":"Best Queso in the WORLD! Salads are amazing! The team has great energy! I would defiantly recommend Zaba's! Did I mention they have beer too?"}
{"text":"Zaba's Mexican Grill is a good place to go to eat fresh food with healthy ingredients. It would be a good restaurant to go as a family, or with friends or associates for lunch or dinner. This would be a good place to have kid's parties too, as it is kid friendly. The burritos on the menu board  are big enough to share with someone else, or to take home to reheat for a second meal. No hours are posted at this new location, or on the flyers in their store. Zaba's Mexican Grill has six other locations in town also, that would be good to visit too."}
{"text":"This is my go to favorite restaurant in Vegas for every day eating. They can make vegetarian or full of delicious meats. They can be gluten free, healthy or add a home made chocolate brownie. They can make your meal super spicy, garlic or mild. This is the place to take the fussy eater or go to lunch with the full team.  The staff is friendly, the space is always super clean and the price is great! I highly recommend Zaba's!"}
{"text":"This food was not good. Everything was underseasoned and items like cheese and sour cream were extremely sparsely given. For the price, I want a handful of cheese and a spoonful of sour cream. This was like the cheap, nasty version of chipotle. Very disappointing during a long night of being out and walking up an appetite"}
{"text":"This has to be my all time favorite place to eat, every time I come in the employees recognize me! Haha! I can literally come here back to back days they have so much to chose from and so many possibilities that it's hard to get tired of it! The employees are clean and very kind. I have tried all of their meats and the steak has to be my favorite! Everything has such good flavor and anyone can find something here. I bring all my friends and family here and every time it is great! Get a rewards card and you can get a free meal, they come fast if you love it as much as I do! (You WILL!)"}
{"text":"Tried their perfecto portion bowl and when you put all of the toppings you'd like, it comes out to a whole lot! Definitely worth the $6."}
{"text":"Got a burrito. Barely had any cheese on it. Asked for more cheese, charged me for it. If this is standard business practices (skimp on ingredients and for a reasonable portion charge extra), then I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty, but I'm not blown away.   Employees are super stingy with toppings. They act like an extra 5¢ of grilled peppers and pico de gallo is a stretch for them."}
{"text":"Zabas is ok but I cant stop comparing it to Chipolte. Although the fish tacos are top notch I prefer Chiptole."}
{"text":"Way better than Chiptole - meat tastes better, more topping options like potatoes, better quality fajitas, and food just tastes better.  Some other reviewer complained about small food portions - is that a joke? Their burrito is almost the size of your head. You can load up your tacos with beans, potatoes, rice, meat, & so on for the same price as regular tacos.   I have ate here regularly for over 10 years and drive the extra mile past Chiptole."}
{"text":"I paid $11 for a CHEESE QUESADILLA..not to mention they charged me extra for salsa, guac, and a drink. Quesadilla was soggy and greasy. I ended up pay almost $15 for a damn quesadilla..are you kidding me???  Plus, the service sucks. Employees don't know how to speak up nor do they listen."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum.  We always love the food here.  The chips are absolutely delicious.  The tortillas are tasty.  I wish they had a salsa bar."}
{"text":"I love Zabas and this location.  Everything always tastes great and appears fresh. Employees are always smiling and cool. I go at least once a week. We get salads, burritos, quesadillas, and I tried the ceviche recently. Was delicious."}
{"text":"Cool place best burrito i had in freemont and that says alot, the rest of the burrito places were just depressing. I had the classic burrito friendly environment as well as employees."}
{"text":"I like this place for food but my review is based upon your high chairs. I went there today with my daughter and nephew, both of them are 1. We went to grab a couple high chairs and everyone of them was broken, a stack of 4 of them . . . All broken. The straps are either missing which could cause a child to slip through because there is no middle strap between the legs or the buckles are broken. I feel like that is a accident waiting to happen. It's a simple fix to a very dangerous situation. We won't be able to dine in if we can't have our kids safe."}
{"text":"No breakfast options. Small portions and they get annoyed if you ask for more. I asked for guacamole and am always told it's extra.  I ALREADY KNOW THIS!!! Then they get pissy and I get barley a spoon full. I had the Expectation of asking for more and getting more for extra but they flat out said no.....  over priced dry food. Go somewhere else!  So if I am ready to order and say example I want a chicken bowl to go with brown rice, why do they ask what rice and what meat after I already said it? It's as bad as ordering though a drive through when you say you want a large #1 with a coke and they ask you what size and what drink after repeating it multiple times!"}
{"text":"Eat here if you want $6 of food for $12.  I do like the service here.  They run out of coke flavors in soda machine consistently and do not have guacamole"}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy Mexican Grill. All their food is made in house and fresh.  Chose your meat of chicken, shredded beef, pork, shrimp or steak, then pick or choice of (3) tacos, burrito, salad or burrito bowl with brown or white cilantro rice.  They also offer shrimp ceviche, homemade brownies, Corona and fresh brewed iced tea. The staff is always friendly here! The the restaurant is always clean. This is a great option if you are looking for flavorful, inexpensive healthy Mexican food."}
{"text":"Zabas was once a place I always wanted to eat. I've been coming  for 7+ years. However, it has sadly stopped catering to their customers and is staffed by rude employees.   I've had several bad experiences here whether it's burnt meat, not properly wrapped burritos, and baby scoops of chicken on a $9 bowl. I have left unsatisfied and feeling like I did not receive my money's worth too many times.   My last experience with my sister was so horrible due to the way she was treated by the employees I will NEVER come back. I was rooting for Zabas to get it together but it seems like they frankly do not even care to try. Their upcharging is also ridiculous.   Everything is extra which I understand to a certain point, but it can really make your meal expensive.   I will definitely stop recommending this place until serious changes are made."}
{"text":"Food was lousy and not vary tasteful or flavorful at all. I love Mexican food and I couldn't even finish my chicken bowl. Service was okay felt rushed."}
{"text":"This is just an over priced Chipotle. The jalapeno potato balls they advertise to be the best thing ever are terrible. Would not recommend it or eat here again. Horrific."}
{"text":"Yesterday we eat at this location.  The food was good and fresh , the stuff was very nice and the General experience was very good. I will definitely go back there"}
{"text":"Food is always good. Staff very nice. My only reservation is groups of teenagers occupying booths not eating.  Just loitering."}
{"text":"When someone orders a shrimp burrito ... common sense would tell you to first check and see if you have shrimp :) instead of building the whole burrito and then throwing it away... not to mention holding up the line and waisting my time :) the throwing away perfectly good food is what bothers me the most"}
{"text":"No idea why this place doesn't have 5/5 stars, place is always clean, & food is always delicious.. Seriously this is my favorite & should be yours too. Highly recommend the shredded beef burrito."}
{"text":"Local, fresh and amazing! Not only that, they donate food to local groups helping out the less fortunate!!!"}
{"text":"Sad to say I wasn't impressed! Pros, it's a clean place and the portions are on the larger side. Cons, I feel that it's overpriced, I waited in line for 20 - 25 minutes, very slow moving, food was good but not great. Same as chipotle, but chipotle is less expensive."}
{"text":"Their guacamole is the bomb. Seriously. If you're shopping and need a quick bite, this is your stop!  Their booths have outlets on the side, and you can even plug a usb straight into them. VERY convenient.   Service was quick, nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Never but anything but high quality food served by a friendly staff. Similar to Chipotle but with much more flavor and options. You cannot go wrong with their menu. Join the club and every 10th meal earns you a free meal and Sundays are double points. Our family loves this place."}
{"text":"I love Zaba's.  Same basic food as Chipolte, but with a lot more choices.  I like that they have shrimp as an option and also brown rice.  Their street corn is also fantastic."}
{"text":"Stopped by and had the chipotle shrimp salad which was delicious. The shrimp are grilled so they have a good flavor they are medium sized. I had the works which included white rice, fajita veggies, hot sauce, mild sauce, sour cream, cheese and guacamole. The salad was fresh and tasty. Price was about 9 bucks my girl had a brownie $1.75 which was really good. Took everything to go but dining and kitchen areas looked clean. Overall good food decent price friendly people which is more than I can say about the centennial chipotle which is the opposite and ticks me off cause I like chipotle. I guess everything happens for a reason though cause if that chipotle wasn't terrible I would've never tried zabas shrimp something chipotle doesn't even offer."}
{"text":"I've been a customer for over 5 years , when Durango location was first opened... Love me a zaba bowl , just the way I like it ! Thanks for keeping it healthy and fresh ! Only one thing , stay open until 10 on the weekdays !"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots. This is guilt free eating (for me) as I typically am not a salad eater but love the shrimp salad at zabas! I could eat this daily! On non-healthy days those fish tacos are pretty outstanding! Have not tried yet for breakfast but absolutely love the lunch option."}
{"text":"OMG! This is the most wonderful Mexican food in Vegas!  I'll come again and again. And great staff!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, super friendly staff, and they let us try the Zalapeno Ballz on the house! Downtown Summerlin is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice.. and this last time, pretty much confirmed that, I don't need to come back!! Went here for national taco day.. I got 5 tacos for $5!! They were really stingy with the meat!! Not to mention, you could only add two toppings!! May I say that, the two toppings were cilantro and onion!! Anything else was .99 more lol.. I got a side of hot sauce!! Which was like 2 tablespoons.. I got charged .99 for my freakin hot sauce!! Why??? Omg!! After me and my husband ate all our 5 micro mini tacos, we were still hungry!! So we ordered the aka street corn,oh we thought \"couldn't be more than $3 bucks right??? For a freaking corn!! Came out to $5 each!! Wow I have never paid more than $5 for a corn in the cob!! I could have bought 10 corns and cheese for that price.. oh well we bought and ate them.. we left disappointed!! This has need the second time we came, and it was empty.. maybe if the food wasn't so limited on the toppings, and zabas didn't charge you .99 for 2 tbls of hot sauce there would be more people here!! Honestly it's on the higher price.. no I will not come back!!"}
{"text":"I really really want to give this place 1 star because I am so disappointed in the customer service i just received its ridiculous... But the food is just too good to do that to them. I work near this location have been here many times, the too gentlemen working tonight treated me as if I was a pure inconvenience !!!!! When I asked for toppings on my bowl that weren't 'included' he was so snappy about them costing extra like he didn't want to do it, never smiled or greeted me. I stood there for a few mins looking up at the menu waiting for him to ask me anything, or if I needed help before I asked if he was ready for me! (There was no other person in line) THEN I get to the register, I said to the cashier \"he really has a bad freaking attitude & he responded by looking at me like I'm stupid and practically yelled \"OH WELL\"... I couldn't believe it. To top it off they handed me my order I got half way back to work before realizing they only gave me half my food!!!!!!! ZABAS GET SOME EMPLOYEES THAT ARE AS GOOD AS YOUR FOOD, SO I CAN GO BACK."}
{"text":"I love the tacos here... The employees always work quickly to get my food and the prices are decent."}
{"text":"Thinks Chipotle on steroids! Delicious and fresh Mexican made how you want in front of you. They are famous for their fish tacos but I got a chicken burrito and didn't regret it. Plenty of seating as it's in the Plaza Hotel food court. Great prices and they also serve liquor if you want to sip one back with your burrito."}
{"text":"I tried most everything on the menu here. I really love this place, it's way better than chipotle. They have options like wheat tortillas and brown rice, plus fish and shrimp tacos which are great. The steak is actually pretty good unlike the little chewy pieces of rubber u get at similar chains. The guac and brownies are excellent. Only complaints are I don't care for the flavor of the carnitas and they are a bit more pricy than their counterparts."}
{"text":"This is like cafe Rio but better in my option. It's taste fresher and you have more options. Plus there are tons of deals that you can take advantage.  Bowls, tacos, burritos, quesadillas and more choices. Pick your poison then select your meat and figure out what else you want(veggies, salsa and cheese mainly).  Great for lunch, quick in and out as well was definitely happy with this choice."}
{"text":"Just got home from eating lunch at Zaba's. No problems or complaints from this place! I ordered the shredded beef burrito [$6.89] that came with your choice of white/wheat flour tortilla, white/brown rice, black/pinto beans, salsa pico de gallo/seasoned corn/green tomatillo, shredded cheese & lettuce. My main man ordered the carnitas burrito [$6.49], same choices. The total came to $17 with a small soda & brownie :)   The burritos seem bigger than the other burrito places, but tiny me never really finishes a fat burrito in one sitting :P Zaba's seems to have larger portions & more variety on their menu. OH & that brownie we ate was bomb. I don't wana say it's as thick as the rice crispy treats they have at starbucks, but it's maybe half that size? Still a big size if you ask me [yea, that's what SHE said].. Anyway ...  It doesn't seem as busy as the other signature gourmet Mexican grills, but I like Zaba's since they have healthier choices as far as the wheat & brown rice. They serve coke products & they have the tabasco sauces [jalapeno, smoked], also cholula! yum yumm.. Since it's in the same shopping area that LVAC is in, they probably have discounts for LVAC members. They also have their liquor license so they have domestic & Mexican beers. I know one of these days I'll show up there sweaty from the gym & drink some beer to gain those calories back. oOoh yes! haha"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Plaza Hotel in downtown Las Vegas and this spot was in the food court. After seeing all the well placed signage about the \"Best fish tacos in Vegas\", my daughter and I were obliged to indulge. I was not disappointed. The fish tacos were absolutely amazing!  We also ordered a burrito, and though they were generous with the meat helping, the pork was rather bland to me. The burrito was still pretty good but definitely couldn't stand on it's own like the tacos. Overall, the service was pleasant, fast, and the food was good."}
{"text":"It's okay little pricey for what you get and I think the quality is just okay and they give you skimpy portion sizes"}
{"text":"The food is good awesome for a late night snack..."}
{"text":"I was wandering around the shopping area with my family and as we got crankier we realized we needed to eat, STAT! This place was within eyeshot so it won out over having to drive somewhere. The food was actually really good. The fish tacos are huge, so don't be like me and order a bowl and a taco and expect to leave with your pants still buttoned up. They also have one of those newish soda fountain dispensers that lets you combine different add on flavors into your drink. For $40, 3 of us had a giant feast and were able to get back to shopping without ripping anyone's head off. Win-win."}
{"text":"I was hoping to get in a working lunch, so I chose this location because their yelp info says they have free wifi.  Ordered my food, sat down and got ready to work only to discover I needed a password.  So, I got up and asked for the password only to find they did not have one.  They shouldn't say the offer it if they don't know the password, or ask cooperate for the password, because thats who they claimed never gave it to them."}
{"text":"idiots behind the counter a manager and a young girl @ 9:30 pm on Monday nite. Way way too expensive for poor people living downtown,Still steep for even the tourists staying there , dont fall for the Freemont Street tacos, they are 2inchs tiny. paid $2.50 for hard stale chips, ate one almost broke a tooth; returned the full bag and asked for an exchange for rice or a refund, she gave me the weiderest look and said I have to consort with the manager. You mean you cant empower your stupid ass employees to exchange a food item? Manager was no where to be found. Bad really bad bland americanized over-priced slop."}
{"text":"The service was so ridiculously slow. We went when the place was just opening, and the line was out the door. The employees had no sense of urgency whatsoever. They weren't overly friendly or even apologetic for the absurd wait time. Also, the food left much to be desired."}
{"text":"I love zabas I usually eat it 3-4 times a week but this location is lacking the zabas love. Service I would give 4 stars. The staff is friendly and greets you. Food quality is 5 stars it seems fresh like the other zabas. The food portions are a lot smaller then the other zabas I eat at. I ask for double sweet potatoes and I get a normal portion. They even skimp you on the guacamole when you pay extra for it. This location is close to my house so I've given it a few chances to get it right. Still needs improving. For being a local franchise there needs to be more consistency in the training. Zabas on flamingo is still the best location so far."}
{"text":"I come to this location often because it is right next to my work. Julie and staff are very friendly. Most of them know what I'm going to order because I get the same thing every time. I love how they have potatoes/sweet potatoes as an option. One thing it's big chain competitor doesn't have. The flamingo location is the best Zaba's in town. I've ate at a few other locations and the service has always been good the food sometimes isn't the same. I also like my bowl made a certain way and it seems this location is the only one who makes it exactly how I like it. Chicken salad, no rice/bean, extra sweet potatoes, hot sauce, cheese, fajita veggies, and guacamole is the magic combination. You can make it a combo with a drink and the lime salt chips for $2.99 more."}
{"text":"love this place, the zabbas balls the bomb.. the interior is beautiful and ambiance is the best.   love it! my favorite place to eat!!!  Oh yeah they sale BEER!! YAY."}
{"text":"After an intense workout, I always get hungry. Zaba's is the perfect place to go after such workout.   Zaba's is located in the same lot as LVAC. It has the same concept as Chipotle and Cafe Rio but with much healthier options. They had brown rice before Chipotle started to offer it. They have whole wheat tortillas. They have fish and shrimp. They win.   I always order a salad with chicken. The awesome thing about Zaba's salads are that all of them come with guacamole, free of charge. I keep out the cheese and sour cream (sad face) to avoid totally ruining my workout. They also have toppings that Chipotle or Cafe Rio do not: sweet potatoes, cabbage, different salad dressings.   The employees there are great. I walked in one time at 8:50 PM when they were about to close at 9 PM. I usually don't do this, but I was really hungry and wanted some Zabas. The employees were really nice about it. I still felt bad though...  Portions aren't too small and they're not too big. I think they're just right. They have a good thing going on in prime location with yummy, fresh food!"}
{"text":"I literally eat here every day. The team is amazing and the service is killer!! Millie, the GM, is for sure the best in town!"}
{"text":"Came in with my daughter and we both ordered a Bowl, which is $5.99, at 2:30pm. We didn't know that there are two different bowls, which is what I thought we were ordering. The Perfecto Bowl, is a half order. I get to the register and they've charged me for a regular bowl. No one ever asked me to clarify what type of bowl. They just charged me for the regular bowl, charged me, and when I said I thought it was $5.99, only then did she explain that there's a difference. The difference is not super obvious either. Just felt that they shouldn't have charged me for the regular bowl, as I indicated that wasn't what I thought I was ordering, if they want to keep a customer. Never going back."}
{"text":"The food is ok nothing special. I had a shrimp with carne asada burrito the price is $12 plus $2 for guacamole if your looking for authentic Mexican food do not come to zaba."}
{"text":"Chipotle knock off.  Food and service was good.    1 star because they use the cheapest cups with lids that don't securely cover the cup.  My drink spilled all over me on the ride home!!"}
{"text":"Good food , terrible customer service. I began ordering and the cook who was making my order made it very clear that she did not want to be there. This was my first time eating at Zaba's and as i was building my burrito i was not informed that certain ingredients would cost extra. my $8 chicken burrito was rung up for the price of $14. The burrito itself was quite tasty, however the price did not meet the quality you'd expect. Many employees came and sat down around the restaurant to go on their phones and at one point sat down at my seat that my food and drink was still at. Because of this experience I will not be dining here again."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this place lately for lunch and it is even better than before. I love the amount of food you can get. I went from the Chicken Burrito on Wheat Tortilla to a Salad with Chicken. I go for the corn, black beans, fajitas, brown rice, chicken, pico, cheese, guacamole, green salsa, and cabbage. Top it off with a water cup.   Healthy and delicious. And very quick service. There is another place I will not name on the opposite side of the building that takes a very long time to order and get your food. This place is a great alternative!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place last night and I gotta say, it was delicious! I got the fish taco plate and it was so good! My husband got a chicken burrito loaded with the works and his was delicious too! We split some tortilla chips and queso and the queso was awesome! We will definitely be repeat customers. Looking forward to trying something new the next time!"}
{"text":"I love the food here but do not eat here if you're hungry the portions are very small the  guacamole is almost non-existent after you order it. I was still hungry so I order chips and queso the queso was a very good amount but the chips was about the size of third of a bag of chips that you would get at a grocery store which is about the size of two handfuls terrible but the food is good so I'll give them an A+ for that but the wait line is terrible the employees seem to talk more than they serve people. So again if you're very hungry do not eat here."}
{"text":"Great food, the best in this neck of the woods. I highly recommend.  Not that expense to eat great Mexican food specially the burrito and the bowls combinations"}
{"text":"Love this place. Only small complaint is the shrimp takes forever to cook, other than that I love it here."}
{"text":"Im pretty much addicted to this place! Their shrimp salad is the bomb and they have hands down the best chocolate brownies I have ever tasted! I come here 4 times a week!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Zaba's and their burritos. Although it may not be game changers for everyone, the potato option is a game changer. I enjoy my potatoes and it adds a nice little texture change. Ordering doesn't get any easier than picking what you want to add to your dish. Definitely worth making your way if you want some on the go Mexican!"}
{"text":"This is probably the nicest Zaba's I've been to. The ordering process and food is essentially the same: type of entree you want, rice, beans, potatoes, meat, salsa, filings. What stood out to me at this location was the soda machine that they had. They have the one soda machine that has hundreds of different kinds of drinks in it and that honestly makes it a lot more appealing than the standard 8-12 selections you may have at any other restaurant. Overall the staff was still very nice and the food was pleasant. If there is one thing that will definitely make or break your visit, they have charging outlets at some of the table. No adapter? No problem, they have USB outlets too so you can definitely charge your device if you have a cord. Have fun eating at Zaba's!"}
{"text":"This was my first Zaba's that I ever visited and the experience was a great one. The employee behind the counter was kind enough to assist me with ordering my first Zaba's burrito. You go through the line like you would through a Subway or Chiptole. Tell the first person in line what kind of entree you want to order: a burrito, bowl, taco, salad, or quesadilla. Afterwards, you choose the kind of rice, beans, vegetables or not, potatoes, salsa, and condiments you want to put on. My first time and possibly my usual includes a burrito with a whole wheat tortilla, brown rice, black beans, fajita vegetables, sweet potatoes, pico de gallo, corn, and cheese. They stuffed my burrito to say the least, which I have no complaints about! Their chips are actually very delicious and crispy. Not a bit of staleness in their chips and it is covered with a hint of lime. The added flavor makes the chips enjoyable to eat even by itself! They are much better than store bought tortilla chips. The best part is that they have a rewards program, one perk over Chipotle that will definitely make me come back, as well as for the sweet potato! Overall a great experience and definitely not my last visit! And also as a bonus tip, you get double points on Sunday's, so you will get two points for every entree you order. Just letting you know :)"}
{"text":"Great 3 carnitas tacos, they have a full make your own setup. Veer is good price nice quick meal to get back at it"}
{"text":"AWESOME!!! This place blows Chipolte away. Always good & always fresh!!! Quesadillas are the best thing on the menu for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"The portions are pretty small. Hubs and I decided to give them a shot as we had to run an errand and Zaba's was in the same parking lot so we figured we could get home quickly.  I got a bowl, and it was pretty shallow so there wasn't much space to fill. Hubs got a burrito and he inhaled that and a serving of queso. I got guac. The amount of chips they give you is ridiculous; it was pretty much two small handfuls, so I took one small handful for me and gave the rest to my husband. The flavors and price weren't bad, so it isn't terrible if you need a quick, convenient meal but the servings are definitely small. The service was ok, but I wouldn't say they were friendly or welcoming. They pretty much just wanted to get us through the line and get us out of there. It was ok, but we probably won't be back and  wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying Chipotle will always be my number 1 in this food category.  But Zaba's overall is still a knock off of Chipotle from the inside to the ordering style. However, they have a few extras that make it an interesting alternative.  You can put potatoes or queso on your burrito or bowl, and you also have seafood options like shrimp and fish.  They have more options when it comes to tortillas as well.  In all, the food itself does not match the quality or taste of Chipotle.  The price was very comparable, their peppers were solid and their corn salsa was above average, but with all things being equal,  I will still opt for Chipotle every day of the week when I'm craving this style of food."}
{"text":"Seriously friendly service! Greeted with a big smile from happy and courteous staff who made everything we wanted to order. The only thing I've ever had here are the fish tacos (BEST OF VEGAS!) and they're great with their in-house chipotle ranch sauce. Wife had the chicken tacos and she rated them excellent. While we didn't order beer because it was too early for us, we do appreciate that they have it on offer for a future, later-in-the-day meal. Bonus: they have one of those soda machines where you can get any and all varieties of soft drink. Vanilla Diet Coke satisfies every time. The atmosphere is cool, modern and, most importantly, clean."}
{"text":"So I thought this was just a regular zabas but it looks like it's the OG original zaba's it was really good I think my nachos needed a little more chips I got pork nachos with pretty much everything on it because I'm a little bit of fatty other than that I would go again it was a perfect ending to my day of just going to a picnic and getting my toes done so I had a good time"}
{"text":"Chipotle rip off restaurant, ok food if you got the $$$. i walk in and see the wall of local celebrity's ( I use that word loosely, Spider-Mans autograph was on the wall) I look at the menu for a little over minute trying to decide what I want because it's my first time and the rude employee said I should step aside because the man that walked through the door 10 seconds is a bigger priority, so I said I'm fine I'll order now. Every thing is exactly like chipotle same choices of rice, meat and sides (except a few extras) I see they have shrimp for my burrito, I get extra and its a additional $4 ( never tell me how much extra) my burrito was only $7 they charge you also if you want a extra tortilla (seriously it's free at chipotle) so a drink and burrito cost me $15.34 and the icing on the overpriced cake was they charged me a .50 cent transaction fee without my knowledge for using my card"}
{"text":"As far as my prowess on burritos go, I would have to say that Zaba's is up there with Chipotle as the top 'fast-food' quick service burrito-crafters around.  The two restaurants are very similar in the simplicity of their menus, but Zaba's just edges out the competition with the addition of some seafood options which I have yet to sample.  I have been to this location a handful of times and I have gotten the carne asada burritos and the pork burritos. I usually only grab a complimentary water cup with my order, and after stuffing the burritos with double-protein my total always ends up being around $11. It does seem a tad bit pricey, but the ingredients are fresh enough to warrant me shelling out the scrilla. They even offer two types of potatoes as ingredients to put inside the burrito. Typically after I grab my food and water I make sure to snag a bottle of the Chipotle Tabasco. Not sure why, but for some reason I go crazy for the stuff. I usually already add green hot sauce to my burrito during its construction, and there is something about that smoky chipotle flavor that makes the meal for me."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Tasty ingredients you can tell are very fresh and service is always good. Way better food and service than cafe rio!"}
{"text":"Had a issue! Owners did the right thing, I will return. They addressed and corrected the issue. They earned my business back due to how quickly they reacted. They went over and above in correcting the matter."}
{"text":"Excellent service with the freshest ingredients. This place has a great atmosphere. They always welcome me and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I never had horchata until one night my cousin brought out a gallon of it at a party.  It was pure cinnamony milky goodness.  She told me she got it at Zaba's and I made it a mission to get more.    I ordered a gallon of the Horchata. I even brought it to work and shared it with a co worker and she even liked it!  I also ordered the Zalapenos for the road and that too was good.  If you like mashed potato balls, this will be good for you.  It was nice and hot!   I'll definitely have to come back and try the rest of their menu.  So with that being said, Happy Eatings!"}
{"text":"I went back a few days ago and got the shrimp salad. It did not disappoint. Their shrimp is always amazing.  Service is always friendly, and I'm spoiled that I live around the corner."}
{"text":"I like Zaba's in fact I prefer it to Rubios. Their portions are generous especially with the Shrimp Bowl I  created. Everything was flavorful that I added so it was not a color filled bowl with no flavor.   I like that they are eco friendly with the cardboard bowls. I like there was no blasting music so we could talk. I like there are outside tables so I can bring the dog when it is not a furnace outside.  I like the tables were clean. I liked that the tap water tastes good so the lines were clean   Yes, I will be back, it is not a destination restaurant but if I am in the area shopping it will be a place I will go back to!"}
{"text":"We have zabas once a week from this location staff is always friendly food is always good sometimes the lines don't move as quickly as you think they will but over all they are good to go."}
{"text":"BETTER THAN CHIPOTLE IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE WAY!   I used to be a dedicated Chipotle addict. I once ate at Chipotle over 80 times in a single year (yes I kept track). But one day, I decided to try Zabas. I'll never go back to Chipotle again.  For those unfamiliar, Zabas essentially does everything that Chipotle does, but better. You have your standard choices of a bowl, burrito, tacos, the usual. Where Zabas starts to impress is their protein selection. Just like Chipotle, they have chicken, steak, and barbacoa, all prepared in essentially the same way as Chipotle. But brace yourself, because Zabas has SHRIMP and FISH! This means, you can have shrimp tacos, fish tacos, or a specialty that they advertise, a \"surf and turf\" (steak and shrimp) burrito. It's phenomenal!  Another thing that puts Zabas over the top is that they offer POTATOES! Both regular and sweet potatoes that can be added to any dish. And it doesn't cost extra! It may not seem like a big deal, but this added starch and texture really takes a burrito or a bowl to another level. If you're lucky enough to get them fresh out of the fryer, it's orgasmic.   THE BEST THING ZABAS HAS TO OFFER IS THE CILANTRO PESTO. OH MY F***ING GOD! This is the greatest sauce I've ever had on anything, ever. I'm not over-exaggerating. I would drink this s**t by the gallon. If you love cilantro and lime, you're doing yourself a massive disservice by not ordering it. I always ask for extra, and I have zero regrets.   Overall, considering the prices are almost identical to Chipotle, once you try Zabas, you will see the light and become a devout follower like myself. I would give them 10 starts in Yelp if I could. IT'S THAT F***ING GOOD! Do yourself a favor and have a meal worth remembering today. Eat Zabas!"}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh, Mexican. Better than Chipotle and Qdoba! We love the ceviche, and the burritos are huge! A must try!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here very much. I got a bowl and the hubby got the fish tacos'. We destroyed my bowl. There was nothing left to it. Not even a piece of lettuce. The fish tacos' were good, but my bowl was definitely better. They have all these topping you can add to your salad or bowl or whatever you order. I thought the price was good, and the service was quick and friendly. I'd definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Been to Zaba's twice, and I like it. It's not great, but I do enjoy. I get the bowls and they look kinda small at first, but once you dig in, it's pretty big. You will definitely get full eating it. I couldn't even finish mine, both times. It's a place where you pick the meat, and topping and they put them into bowls, or burritos. They charge extra for queso and guacamole I believe. They do serve beer which went excellent with my bowl. It's not quite fast food, but it's not like a formal restaurant. Very casual and chill. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat, everything they have is delicious and big i definitely recomend any bowl or the huge burritos i almost eat the all menu and everything is yummy.  I definitely recomend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"This place is rarely busy.  The employees are pleasant and pretty fast, a bit too fast as I feel kinda rushed.  I'm new to this chain, so I need time deciding.  I'm a Chipotle lover, but since I live closer to this spot I've been stopping in.  It's a close comparison, however I do like the vinaigrette dressing better here - it's very zesty!  I've only had the chicken bowl/salad... so, I'll need to try other options.  I give them 4 stars as I enjoy my food of choice every time."}
{"text":"This place used to be so good. Not so much anymore. Hit or miss on the flavor. I feel like the shrimp should be cooked at time of order. Cold seafood is gross. Never cared for their staff. Almost always pissy and act like you're a huge inconvenience to them. We always pay for extra cheese but they skimp so bad on it still. I will say though the nice employee is Christina. She has a beautiful smile and is very nice. I gave a 2 because the place is always clean and Christina!"}
{"text":"I came here last week after it came highly recommended. I ordered the fish tacos only because it says they were voted \"best of Las Vegas\" they were terrible. The fish was described as lightly breaded but it in fact was a fish stick. Not an amazing fish stick but something generic and pulled out of the freezer. That's what it tasted like anyway. I got an order of 3 and barely ate one. It also made my stomach pretty upset for the rest of the day. I won't  be going back.  The 2 stars instead of 1 is because the costumer service was good nothing exceptional but far from terrible. My friend goes here weekly and enjoys their salad so there's that."}
{"text":"I work near this restaurant and have eaten here many times.  The food is consistent and the service is speedy and friendly.  I like that they have both white and brown rice to chose from. The guacamole is better at this establishment than any other places that are similar."}
{"text":"I went here before closing the other night, & unlike other restaurants when they run out of something they actually made me my shrimp fresh. I have to say this was some of the most exceptional customer service I've ever received, & I work in customer service my self. It was probably one of the best experiences I've had in a restaurant, Melly blew it out of the park.. I'd give her a raise myself if I could. :) A++"}
{"text":"Bowls get smaller, portions get smaller. My last bowl was not even 1/3 filled. Cheap. Original owners must have sold out."}
{"text":"Saw this place opening recently and talked to a couple of people at the nearby bank about it.  They both told me it was similar to Chipotle.  They were definitely right.  While I think I prefer the quality of Chipotle's ingredients, I like the options that Zaba's has more.  Chipotle has better rice and barbacoa (Zaba's shredded beef is the closest thing), but Zaba's has better chicken and I love that you can get potatoes as well (and they're good!).  Zaba's spicy salsa is really good, too. One cool thing is that if you get one of their bowls but don't get many ingredients they will give you a discount.  I think a chicken bowl is normally around $7 but since I got one with chicken, rice, and cheese only they only charged $5 or so for it.  Everyone told me that Zaba's has larger portions than Chipotle, but I didn't really sense that from the bowls.  Employees are very cheery despite being very busy during their big opening week.  I'll definitely be heading back."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new location after hearing good reviews of the chain overall but unfortunately the staff's demeanor distracts from any positives the food may offer. The 2 ladies behind the counter seemed irritated and miserable with life in general. Not only were they practically mute and unhelpful when we said it was our first time there and we were trying to decide what we should get, neither smiled once or said thank you and barely even looked up from whatever they were doing. First and last time here I guess, better off sticking to Chipotle where they appreciate their customers."}
{"text":"They have the best grilled shrimp tacos, because it's a build your own type of place. I love that I can pick what comes on my food.  Try! I never see a long lines, but it's really good, I think better than the place that starts with C."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Mexican fast food ever.. I really tried to like their food but it was just terrible .. I had the fish taco and it completely  fell  apart on the first bite, somewhat cold corn tortilla couldn't hold it together . It was bland and just zero wow factor to it , also had the home made queso and chips, the queso was way too thick and lacked flavor, the chips were just  so so, the best thing I had was the coke zero... I won't be back.. I was expecting more and just wasted good money on subpar food! Yuck"}
{"text":"This place was a rip off of Chipotle except a little more expensive and not as tasty. They also want to charge you extra for everything, including sour cream."}
{"text":"This location in particular is really good. Great, fast service and good amount of meat/shrimp portions. During lunch time with a long line, the staff is always very fast and efficient. The manager Maria is always helping and right up front when the lunch rush is at its peak.  She is hands-on and very friendly with staff and customers. After visiting another location under different management, I'm even more impressed with Maria and the staff here. The location near my house is considered a better area of town, but this location beats them in my opinion. It's a bit of a splurge lunch for me only a few times a month with the shrimp bowl or salad coming in around $10. It's well worth it though, as I'm always super full afterwards."}
{"text":"Hi yes Jess was very nice in calling us to replace our order and the office was very please. Thank you very much for hearing us and making things right. I will continue being a valued customer."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last week because of the positive yelp reviews. I did not like the food at all. It was so bland. The medium-hot green salsa was not spicy at all. We also got those jalapeno balls (I think that's what they were called). They were nothing but mush with raw jalapeno in it. Overall unhappy with it and most likely will not go back.  Gave it 2 stars because the staff was very kind"}
{"text":"Staff was decent, food was bad that's not street corn it's corn with some chili powder that's not right what is this sad I paid 5 dollars for this. Over priced under delivered. Like what in this corn is greasy?? Also why doesn't the corn taste washed at all"}
{"text":"I keep trying to give this location a chance! Our food just is never as good as the location by my job (Flamingo).  My rice on my Zaba bowl was super bland. I have no idea what was missing but it was horrible. I am still pissed about purchasing a kids meal and no drink if my child is not with me really???  If you're picking up dinner after work your child may or may not be with you! Then I kept telling the girl to add my Zaba's card and of course she didn't so instead of holding up the line I figured I would do it myself. Well my receipt doesn't have the code FAIL! Corporate office never responds to issues. Uggh so done with Zaba's.  Should be 2 stars but I'm being nice."}
{"text":"I am a fan of all things Zaba's. Standard build your own burrito style set up, you have your options set out before you with delicious shredded beef, sweet shredded pork, shrimp and carne' steak available. The shredded beef is tasty and can almost always be found in my burrito. White and brown rice makes its appearance alongside the brown and pinto bean duo to fill up your wheat and white tortilla blankets. Something neat about zabas is they introduce different sauces to the mix as well as a queso dip. You can add these to your burrito for an extra kick. On a closing note pick up the frequent buyers card. After so many burritos one shows up free. All you have to do is swipe the magical card."}
{"text":"Great food high protein low fat perfect flavor for a after gym meal the food is good enough to deal with the fake customer service the employees look like they just don't want to be there and if u ask for something added you get this look like uh no you didn't"}
{"text":"I went with my whole family and we honestly started our experience not very nice with a supervisor that was very rude at us and just left without resolving our issue because she was \"busy\" her name was something like Viri but i must put a review to tell everybody that if they do have an inconvinient with this supervisor they should stay and speak with GRACE who we had the chance to and we are very happy we did because she did resolve our issue and we LOVED this place, the rest of the staff is also great and the food is amazing i will definitely recommend it... dont let one person ruin what can end in a great experience like our did!!!! AWESOME PLACE!!! THANK YOU GRACE!!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the Plaza Hotel...definitely worth stopping in if you don't get side tracked by Hash House..really good tacos.. nachos..heck even the salad was amazing"}
{"text":"This place is basically a Qdoba knockoff...which is basically a Chipotle knockoff...which is basically an insult to Mexican food. Also, I am basically an insult to Mexican food. Because all I do is eat it and then write crappy reviews about the place that nourished me.  I actually liked it here but it felt a little expensive for what it was. Don Tortaco just down the street is a much better choice for your wallet. Maybe not for your belt though."}
{"text":"The only thing worth eating here is the queso dip. I had a steak burrito and it was nothing special. The red Salas tasted like fish. Chipotle has way better salsa! The service was below average and the restaurant smelled like dirty mop water and old fish.   My wife had wilted cabbage on her fish taco. Overall not a great experience,I will not return."}
{"text":"I love Zaba's. My favorite thing on their menu is their steak quesadillas! Hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD - for the price! It's delicious and it's fast!! Every time the quesadilla is ridiculously tasty and the queso dip is addictive. They make great guacamole, too.  I usually have the steak tacos - you can't lose, really.  It's the perfect Mexican place for the perfect price.  I'M HUNGRY!!!"}
{"text":"The grilled shrimp salad was okay. Surprisingly not much lettuce but a lot of fajita mix although generous with the shrimp. The Classic burrito and beef taquitos were pretty good. The service was fast and friendly. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try this place to add some variety to my Chipotle-Qdoba-rinse-repeat routine, but I didn't get around to it until I moved in across the street from the Eastern location.  My first burrito was a disappointment. I had shredded beef in a flour tortilla with a mixture of white and brown rice, their red (hot) salsa, and cheese. There was a very sweet taste to the burrito. At first I thought it could be the brown rice, but then I remembered that their site describes the red salsa as \"slightly sweet\". Slight understatement.  I decided to give them a second chance tonight and ordered the same burrito with their green (medium) salsa, minus the white rice. It was a much better experience. There was still a slight sweet taste (the brown rice must be partly to blame), but the quality of the meat and the huge portion size made this a legitimate rival to the two big burrito chains. Bonus points for the employee who genuinely did not seem annoyed when I walked in at 8:59, not realizing they close at 9:00. As they bagged my tin-foil cylinder of goodness, I briefly considered saying, \"I wanted that for here\", but thought better of it."}
{"text":"I always regret giving them my business. The staff is SO rude and impatient with their customers. I feel that they want to hurry you out of there as quickly as they can by talking over you and by also giving the smallest portions. It's like they don't want you there..so with that I'll just never go back! Dealing with their sarcastic and condescending tones is just not worth it."}
{"text":"I've been going here for over 13 years.  I have never once been disappointed. Everything is always fresh and made exactly how I order it.  The service is very friendly and the food is delicious. If you go at anytime other than the traditional lunch time and order fish tacos, the fish is fried fresh for you.  I'll take Zabas over Chipotle ANY DAY!"}
{"text":"very clean place to eat i ordered the zaba half chicken half steak bowl also adrianna who was the one who welcomed me when i arrived was very pleasant karla the manager offered me a tester of the best cucumber and lime drink agua fresca ive ever tasted witch they also serve it with sauza tequila as another option, deff would come back specially if the same girls are working here"}
{"text":"Was hungry for quick Mexican food, so I stopped by this place.  I've passed by it a hundred times and finally decided to try it.  This place reminds me of Qdoba & Chipotle.  I ordered the Nachos & a Quesadilla.  The Nachos were tasty, but I thought that they drenched it in the ingredients and the bottom half of the dish was soggy....I hate that.  The Quesadilla was good...not great, just good.  The service was ok....they didn't offer me all of the fixings...I had to ask for guacamole & green salsa, it wasn't offered....this is unusual for a place like this.  Normally, they try to upsell the hell out of you with the extras.  Will I return?  Maybe.  I still like Qdoba & Chipotle better."}
{"text":"Tonight is the third time I've been to Zabas after a long night working and craving a steak burrito and 3 times Ive walked out because they are out of steak. Wtf. How does that even happen. That's like McDonald's running out of burgers. It should never matter that's it's after 8pm."}
{"text":"Zabas makes the most amazing burrito in the whole world. The burritos are the size of my head and the veggies are so fresh. I don't usually visit this location but this one is good too.  Please notice all the reviews are from meat eaters. I only point that out because I can't relate to their complaints. But if you want a slamming vegan burrito, go here.   The veggie burrito is $7.50, huge, with guac included. Besides, what IS cheap these days? I'd rather pay a little more for fresh veggies too so yeah, that's my take.   Services is friendly, fast, efficient. Restaurant is clean. I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Zabas in my opinion is way better than Chipotle! They got way more options for ingredients to put into your meal, superior quesadillas, sweet potatoes, and FIRE GRILLED SHRIMP. AND yes its actually really F-in good! They also have this chipotle ranch that literally tastes good to dip in with everything!"}
{"text":"First of all... I was starving but that's not their problem... I was looking for a decent breakfast burrito, I mean cmon??? They aren't that hard to make them tasty. The burrito was cold, wet and bland. My cheese wasn't melted.. they need to step up the taste of their breakfast burritos. I threw it away half way through.. I should have just gotten subway! The customer service was on point though, they just need to step up the quality and taste of it!"}
{"text":"Bf and I have been coming here for ages. Essentially, it's a made-to-order, Mexican take-out restaurant (although there are almost always enough tables to sit at if you prefer to dine in). Good burritos and bowls. Prices are decent. Fresh ingredients. Sides and extras are good too. My only issue are their drinks- no horchatas and the only real option to soda is some green or black tea that doesn't taste very good. My bf would love to see a salsa bar added   :)"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for work and we stopped by this place as it was right near where we needed to be. It was very similar to Chipotle as far as the ordering and the types of food. It was a relatively small place, however the seating was really conveniently situated around the restaurant to make use of the place. I ordered a variety  of thinks in my bowel and it was all pretty good. I think that it is hard to go wrong when the food is decent and you get to choose what you want in it."}
{"text":"Chipotle who? This place is incredible! Pick what you want as it's made to order in front of you - and for a much less exile dive price than you are used to.   We got Zaba bowls, rice, protein, beans, extras. Delicious. Just the right amount of food for my hungry husband. - I couldn't finish mine. Chips and quest are also fantastic.   The staff are what sealed the deal. They are super happy and appear to love what they do and that makes all of the difference.   A friendly place with great food and we can both eat for less than $13? We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was just ok ! Very dry . Meat didn't look good in warmers ,over. Cooked and dry . I ask the lady where are the condiment , I grab some napkin staws, and forks. The lady followed me to condiment  and complain  about me taking a extra staw. The place needs trained costmer sevice"}
{"text":"Oh My!!!! HEAVEN!!!! Lovely, CLEAN facility with super fresh food and great choices!! Friendly staff and decent prices!!  I've found my new lunch spot!! YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing everytime. We come here every couple weeks and my husband loves the carde asada burrito. I always get the shredded beef. No reason to not give Zaba's 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Super good & fresh food!! We go here about every 2 weeks. Kayleigh loves their beans & cheese burrito, Candice loves the chips & queso, & I always get the chicken burrito! SOOOO GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Always so good! Kayleigh loves the pinto & cheese burrito- Candice loves the chips & queso & my favorite is the chicken burrito!"}
{"text":"Been a Zabas fan ever since the first one opened here. Always loved Chipotle but since I've discovered Zabas, I haven't eaten there in years! Just imagine Chipotle's bigger brother....on steroids...or should I say a health kick?  They have everything they have and more. A choice between white and brown rice, a choice between white or wheat tortillas and a whole lot more! And they have Coke Zero! Whoot Whoot Holla!!!  Staff is quick and know what they are doing! This location even offers free WiFi! I recommend everyone to try this place and jump off the Chipotle bandwagon!"}
{"text":"Went here last Friday with a coworker to grab some lunch. When I worked for PBS I came all the time, but it has been a while since my last visit.  They have many new options like Nachos and breakfast since the last time I went. I usually get the Zaba Bowl but I decided what the heck I will get Nachos as the girl working the assembly line assured me the queso wasn't overly spicy, I am a wuss and can not handle spicy..its sad really..  I got the Nachos and a small drink to go and I think it was 9.08. Not overally cheap, more than Chipotle but about the same as Cafe Rio. It was good and they were friendly, so i would likely return.."}
{"text":"A little more expensive compared to chipotle/qdoba. The shrimp was very delicious and the overall meal seemed healthier than similar restaurants."}
{"text":"This is right across the street from where i live,  so we basically just go here for convenience.  I'm a vegetarian,  and they offer decent - tasting fajita veggies. However,  they are not at all generous with their portions. The boyfriend is a big meat eater and he always gets double steak and chicken in his burrito, which they are happy to charge for. He always has to ask them to add more,  to which they always seem super annoyed. I get their queso (which is very yummy) in my burrito, which they are also happy to charge for. The last time i ordered it they barely put any on there,  and i asked for a little more, which was granted with a scowl, and barely added more.  At the end she charged  me twice for the barely - there queso. All together with a veggie burrito,  a double meat burrito,  one large drink,  and chips and queso the bill was nearly $40. Ridiculously overpriced.  Q'doba is much better and they give better portion sizes."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try a new place to eat and came across this spot. It's pretty much another version of Chipotle, but this place offers nachos and taquitos. The food was good. Burritos are pretty big and they are filling (unless you're just greedy, then you would eat more). The prices are just a bit more than Chipotle, but no big deal. The staff was friendly and this place was super busy. The line was continuously out the door, so business is pretty good. You have the option to sit inside or outside. Overall, if we are hungry and all other places are at capacity, we'll come here."}
{"text":"My first visit here & I was very satisfied!  The fish tacos were AWESOME! Definitely an upgrade from Chipotle! There is so much more to choose from on the menu. Definitely will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is near my office so I have had the opportunity to try it 4 times in the last 2 months.  I love this place more than Chipotle and Q Doba (which are both tasty).  I have had the Vegetarian Burrito,the Papas Burrito, and the salad with chicken.  I love the options- wheat tortillas, brown rice or the white cilantro rice (I like the cilantro version), the 2 types of potato's, the yummy salsa's, the beans...  I a dying to try their nacho's and taquitos.    They have awesome fresh brewed iced tea.  Lunch usually costs about $9 or $10.  The staff at this location are very friendly & helpful!!!!"}
{"text":"I loved the veggie and seafood options here. You will not find potato tacos or grilled shrimp at places like Chipotle,but you can here! They also have a selection of aguas. I'll definitely come back here next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are always here~ one of our go-to places when we can't decide on what to eat. My boyfriend is a little more adventurous when it comes to ordering. I usually always get the Grilled Chipotle Lime Shrimp in either a burrito or salad & it never fails me! Portions are great & flavor is delicious!  And they make sure their everything is fresh and consistent.  You'll never wanna go back to Chipotle again once you've tried here."}
{"text":"Zabbas is a Mexican inspired quick service restaurant that reminds of Chipotle. I'm going to compare it to Chipotle since it's what I know. Do I think it's better than chipotle? No.  I've had Zabas a handful of times for catered lunches. I stopped in today to try them out my way and first hand.  My first thoughts were that I liked the employees and that it was clean. They basically offer the same things as chipotle: bowls, burritos, tacos. They even have a corn salsa and a bright red hot salsa that are the norm for my chipotle order. They have additional add ons though in the form of potatoes, sweet potatoes, queso sauce, and shrimp.   I got a bowl, brown rice, chicken, potatoes, fajita veggies, corn salsa, hot red salsa, and lettuce. My first impression was that the salsa was super spicy! Other than that I thought the meal was a miss. The flavors just weren't there for me.   The food was fresh, the workers were nice, the place was clean and I thought the prices were okay. I feel like I could definitely get a cheaper burrito at chipotle though.  I would return to try their shrimp or their \"voted best in Vegas\" fish tacos, but I won't be rushing back.  I guess I'm a Chipotle kind of guy."}
{"text":"Had to go by one of my favorite places for lunch. Life has been busy and haven't had time or been in area.  As usual the staff is great with smiles n friendly.  Food was fresh n hot as always.  Never a bad choice to enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"I love the breakfast and regular taco's at Zarba's. Huge fan of the chorizo and the shredded beef, but honestly it is all good. It's conveniently located in the Plaza Hotel at west end of the Fremont Experience. It's local. It's tasty. And there is never a long wait. The only issue is that it can easily get pricey."}
{"text":"After almost a YEAR of friends telling me how amazing Zaba's was - I finally tried it out.. And I've been there twice this week!! I have been a Chipotle addict forever and just couldn't believe there was anything better. Chipotle is the McDonald's version of Zaba's. OMG did I just admit that?! Um yea!! I'll literally never go back if I have Zaba's as an option!! WAY fresher!! So so many more options!! Everything is so colorful and REAL!! I'm freaking obsessed!! I will be telling everyone I know."}
{"text":"its close to lvac so if you need a little post workout recovery burrito, i suggest going here. i get brown rice, sweet potato, half chicken half steak, corn, tomato, green sauce, sour creme, and cheese. if anything, get the sweet potato. the flavor combo is perfect with the burrito."}
{"text":"Good food and good for you I lost 60lbs working out and eating here. If you order a 3 item or less bowl or  burrito it's just under five bucks I order the chicken  burrito in a whole wheat tortilla with red hot sauce I eat here almost every day"}
{"text":"Ive been to this location a time or two before food is good most of the time. However was in today and was only the 2 person in line and placing a to go order for lunch and slow service \"Martha\" was so extremely mean rude and plain out disrespectful to me I will definitely think really hard before ever returning to this location. Plus they did not have a f few different items I wanted this time. Think really hard before going to this location."}
{"text":"Best burritos in Vegas......hands down!!! Red sauce is perfect!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Zaba's fan, and eat it at least once a week. The one star doesn't reflect how I rate Zaba's as a whole. However, this location is garbage! Poor customer service and the portions are insulting. I got less meat in my bowls here when ordering extra, then I did on a regular bowl at other Zaba's! I will be driving out of the way to go to the other locations! The Flamingo and 215 location will be getting my business from now on."}
{"text":"Stopped in for their breakfast. Ordered the breakfast burrito. It ended up being much larger than I expected. I didn't know if I could eat the whole thing for breakfast, but I did. Everything was freshly made"}
{"text":"First of all when me and my wife came over they didn't have chicken ready, so my wife took steak instead, it was so like a chewing gum not a steak ! And I have to wait 15 min for them to make it ready and that's was so bad.  I'll like this restaurant but not this location for sure"}
{"text":"Food by far is the best around and we have a lot of choices in the area. The reason for 3 stars is the kids eat free on sundays policy. Every time we go in it's a different standard. I.e.: kids must be present, kids don't get a drink on f not present, kid looks to old for free kids meal, flat out no. I just want to know what's the policy. I understand if kids must be present I'm ok with that it's just like I'm stealing whenever I ask for it cause it's never given to you. So all around very good food and we love it. The rewards program is wonderful too."}
{"text":"It is difficult for me to believe that I had not tried Zabas before yesterday given how much I like burritos. I was with my family hanging out on Mother's Day and we were getting hungry. There was Zabas nearby and it was calling our names. I was amazed at how much it is like Chipotle. The food on the menu is very similar. You have your standards like grilled chicken, grilled steak, carnitas and shredded beef. There is brown rice, white rice, pinto beans or black beans, fajita style veggies, a variety of salsas, sour cream, cheese and guacamole. They have lettuce to choose from if you so desire. They even have cabbage. I got a steak burrito with brown rice, black beans, corn salsa, cheese and sour cream. It was a big filling burrito very much like Chipotle gives me. I think Chipotle has a little more flavor than Zabas. At least when it comes to the steak. I think it was a salty component I was missing. Perhaps the shredded beef is more strongly flavored. It looked good for sure. I was really quite happy with Zabas and look forward to trying it again. The food is good and I have no complaints of the service."}
{"text":"Major disappointment! Flavor wise this was delicious! I ordered the crunchy tacos and when the lady up front was putting the rice, beans, and meat on she slopped it over all 3 crunchy taco shells. Right away I thought this was weird and messy but I didn't say anything thinking it wasn't going to affect them except maybe them being messy. After I left with my Togo order I went home which was maybe 5 minutes away and got my son situated. They probably sat for 10 minutes maybe 15. By the time I ate them they were completely soggy and soaked in beans/pork juice. I couldn't even pick them up. Had the lady put everything in each individual shell and wrapped them up differently I believe the problem would have been eliminated. Super disappointing, I wanted my crunch!"}
{"text":"I like this place for a quick lunch. It's a little like Chipotle in that you choose your ingredients as you go down the line. I wish they had more vegetarian and seafood options.  Although, I have to say , the grilled shrimp are delicious!"}
{"text":"They run a very good operation there. Food is great, and the service is tremendous. They get you through the line very quickly, price is reasonable. I could eat there everyday."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place!!!! Diana and Vyolet are the best, I don't even have to tell them my order they just know what I get!  The food here is so good and it's always nice when the staff is sweet. :)  .....wayyyyy better than cafe rio"}
{"text":"Best burrito I've had, so far. The size is insane and literally well worth the money."}
{"text":"I was going to chipotle for years and it was good all  but it didn't have too much texture or flavor. So one day my daughter told me to try Zabbas. Hands down THE BEST Mexican grill in Vegas! It's a MUST TRY! Fresh-fast-affordable-clean"}
{"text":"Not bad :) Not bad :) I'm obsessed with Mexican grills.  Portion size was good.  Meat was good.  Guac was Fabu!  But I would still have to go to cafe rio and rank that my top pick, but I would definitely come back here.  The service was great!!  The dude at the counter was incredibly chipper.  I was happy to see how HIGH the ameba sneeze glass was which made it a little hard to hear them as they took my order, but I'll take that any day over having peeps highjacking my grub with their infected germs :) :)  Anyhoo, all in all, the black iced tea was delish, and I would like to request a larger offering of faux sweetener - splenda please :)"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. Friendly service. Chipotle ranch was a nice addition to my steak quesadilla."}
{"text":"Great holiday promos: - Cinco De Mayo special: $5.00 burritos - Free item for Moms on Mother's Day with drink purchase - Birthday promotion- if you join the club - Regular- SUNDAY promotion: kids eat free (with adult entree purchase)  These are just a few reasons to eat here! I had the steak bowl (it's enough for us to share, except our son didn't like the cabbage too much, sometimes, he's a picky eater. You pretty much select everything like Chipotle- type, rice, meat, salsa, corn, veggies, sour cream, lettuce, or cabbage, etc. (I like the carnitas better here though.) Hubby gets the burrito and my son and I share the bowl. Yummy. The hot salsa was very hot. Maybe, I'll opt for the medium one next time.    The last time we came here was last week; this location is pretty close to home (we tried going to the other one, but it was closed permanently). Steady flow of people were coming in and it was towards the end of the night, too. Clean restaurant. Nice staff."}
{"text":"It's been too long since we've eaten here, but this was our first visit to this one in particular (last sunday- we decided to spend the day at Downtown Summerlin).   I've tried many different things (taquitos, tacos) on the menu but this time I got the carnitas nachos with the housemade queso sauce (a little on the salty side) and I wasn't sure how big it would be, but it was pretty big, which was surprising (the lady said it depends on what I added to it, and she was right- I had the fajitas (onions & peppers), green salsa, cabbage & some sour cream ). I love the carnitas at Zaba's! The nachos were really good until the last cheesy layer at the end which was at the very bottom, due to the salty queso cheese, so tossed it (plus some of the chips might've been salty, too). I might get it without it next time. Our son liked the nachos too, yup, we shared. Hubby had the burrito but said he likes the carnitas at Chipotle the best. He said it was still good, though, just not the best. For the three of us, lunch was under $20.00.  There are Zaba's Favorites (7 items, like Fish Tacos, Papas burrito featuring potatoes, Veggie Burrito) or Create Your Own Favorite (step 1- choose, your meat, step 2- choose your item, step 3- customize) as well as Kid's Meals (quesadilla, bowl, burrito, tacos), Sides/Combos (taquitos, tacos, zalapeno ballz, queso, rice & beans, chips & salsa, guacamole, & brownies. Drinks are soda, water, and some bottled drinks.  It was early, so the place was empty; except for the couple outside and the people who just paid for their meal. We were greeted right away. One employee was taking the brownies out of the pan; hubby noticed that they are fresh here. After seeing the menu, decided to eat here for lunch. The customizable drink fountains are also free refills (to the left of the cashier). Kitty corner from the drinks are the napkins, forks, and sauces (Tabasco Chipotle is so good) are towards the door to get outside for the outdoor seating. The bathrooms (single for each ) are also pretty close to this area; pretty clean. The glass windows are not tinted, so there's high visibility.    There is indoor seating which is similar to Chipotle's restaurants- a large square-shaped room. The outdoor seating is pretty good, except, we barely squeezed through with the stroller (ok, it's a common problem we have), had to move some of the chairs to get to the corner table with an umbrella for sun cover. It was nice outside, the sun was shining, but it wasn't hot yet. No bugs or insects to disturb our lunch. We sat overlooking the fountain water feature and Dillards, which was closed.   We'd come here again (unless another  area restaurant's menu entices us). Maybe try something else. Or else get the nachos without the queso. Mmm, nachos."}
{"text":"This review is for 4.5 stars. I've been here a couple times before writing this review, but it had been years. My husband didn't like it his first time here. And so glad to have become reacquainted! We ended up going here twice in a two week period BTW. Funny short story. Recently, he asked me \"What's for lunch? When I said \"Zaba's\". He said \"Are you serious?\" (\"Cause, usually, I say \"El Pollo Loco.\") But we ended up at Baja Fresh.  Looks small from the outside appearance. Seating is in front, outside, inside (square booths, think kitchen nook), stools facing the window, looking outside, as well as another area outside, in back, too. Bathrooms are in the back of the restaurant. Clean place, clean bathroom. Your food is made to order, right in front of you, like Chipotle. You choose your preferred ingredients. Free Refills on fountain drinks.  We went for lunch, not crowded, but seems to have more takeout orders than dine-in. The first time, I had taquitos, which comes with a side of guacamole and chips. Crunchy goodness, but not greasy. The guacamole was fresh. I enjoyed it. The second time, I had the single tacos, one shrimp, one fish. I liked the fish taco better. Don't get me wrong, the shrimp one was good, but I liked the seasoning better on the fish, and the crunch, too. There is also a 3-taco combo, but the 2 tacos I got were good enough for me. The salsa is very good, too.   My husband got a couple different items- a burrito, on both occasions; also sampled the different meats. I think I like the pork better here, than at Chipotle. I noticed that there are many different menu items (tacos, burritos, taquitos) but the salads cost much more. Much like Chipotle (he didn't like it there the first time, either), he likes Zaba again. But unlike Chipotle, also has shrimp and fish on the menu, too.   I might get something different the next time we go."}
{"text":"Pretty much the same thing as Chipolte. I usually get a bowl with either chicken or shrimp.   The last time I went, it took them forever to come serve us in the line. There weren't any patrons in there when we walked in and by the time we sort of stared at the menu and wanted to order, they were still dilly-dallying around in the back and had even made eye contact. Didn't even get a \"hey, I'll be right there\" sort of thing. It still took them a good minute to finally walk over, put in their gloves and ask us what we wanted. The customer service with the exception of that incident is usually pretty decent."}
{"text":"This place looks like Chipotle, but they've got a few other options like fish tacos and nachos. I got the bowl with shredded beef which was alright. The red salsa, I probably asked for four scoops thinking it'd be like chipotle. But it is actually  3x spicier. Yeah, I'm sweating from my nose right now thinking and talking about it because I was in for a surprise when I took a bite of my burrito bowl. So, that's an FYI for ya if you like spicy red sauce.   The fish taco was oh Kay. The fried codfish was awesome, but the sauces in the taco were just average, and I especially wasn't fond of the tortilla. It's bought apparently, and you can tell.  Service was good, restaurant is clean. I was passing by and starving so I gave it a shot.   I'd give a solid 2.5 stars for this place. Would I come back? I guess I'd rather go to a hole-in-the wall or taco truck. $3.45 for a taco is quite pricey when it tastes just OK. The question comes down to chipotle or this place, as that would be a fair comparison.   I think the shredded beef was delicious and possibly tastier. The portion was a bit smaller, and price is competitive. I'm kinda sold on chipotle's red sauce, so that might tip me over a tad bit. But if you're looking for some quick fish tacos in the area, I'd give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff with delicious healthy fresh Mexican!! I love their shrimp salad and shrimp tacos. Lots of choices for me the is gluten and dairy free!"}
{"text":"Really great mexican fast food! Service was fast, we ordered fish tacos (really healthy and yummy!) and steak quesadillas. Food was prepared fast as well, and its not salty! Most places ive been to have too much salt on their food, not Zaba's though, for some it might be blant (my husband said it needed more salt) but for me its perfect the way it is."}
{"text":"Wow was just in here couples of weeks ago and service is horrible. I waited in line for more than 5 minutes and there was no employee behind the counter when the lady employee came out she was so rude the food was cold and dry. Half of the menu was out and they didn't even bother of making more. I wouldn't even give them any stars!"}
{"text":"I like their food and they are nice, but they keep giving my two kids less and less food.  It is 6 dollars for each of the two kids meals - two tacos and in each taco there was just a dab of meat and some chips on the side.  It did not even fill up my kids and they ended up eating 1/3 of my bowl.  It's ok to short me, but don't cheat my kids thinking I won't care.  I do.  Same with the side portions.  I will try to post a picture of the small amount of beans they served me.   We have been eating here since they were located on Rampart and we keep going less and less for this reason.   Food is good otherwise, but it is often cold, which is common to this type of serving method."}
{"text":"Seriously my favorite fast Mexican food in Las Vegas. I've been eating at this location since I first moved her about 8 years ago. Same amazing quality since. I don't understand people on here saying the service is bad, every time I walk in I get amazing quick service. I know there is a language barrier with many of the employees so some may take their demeanor as rude but they're just trying to do their job. I prefer this place over chipotle any day. Quality food that's always hot and always fresh. I also love the seating area here and usually stay to eat there. Also don't forget to grab a brownie on your way out, they're delicious and only a dollar WOW. Would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I go to the one on Durango and North 215. They give generous portions and the food is good. The employees are really nice also."}
{"text":"The only thing I had at this restaurant were the fish tacos, so my 5 stars are for those.  The fish (Cod) was cooked to perfection and not too greasy or 'fishy'.  Everything tasted pretty fresh and the combo of flavors was really good.  I would pick this as a meal over one of the glitzy casino buffets.  Fast friendly service.  Located within the Plaza hotel/casino first floor shopping area to the right of the check in area."}
{"text":"Just wanna give a shout out to an employee by the name of Saul. Hes very sweet and is generous when it comes to making my salad that I always get. I love the veggies and sauce...I always give a tip just so they remember me for next time hoping they'll maybe be a Lil more generous when it comes to portion sizes..but this time I couldnt since I didnt have no cash ...I would personally give Saul a tip just for how nice he is ! But Anyways tho this location is the best !  Everyone is awesome ."}
{"text":"Love this place. Healthy options and always clean and food always taste really good. It's like a better chipotle, lots of more to pick from and their food is much much yummier. I enjoy their limited time options but please bring the elote to the menu forever!"}
{"text":"Would have given them a higher review but now recently they start measuring their ingredients and now charge for extra salsa which quite frankly annoys me and is not called for when the customer is always right! Their food is good and the flavors are good but the last time I went here really irritated me so much that I will not be back. Too many fast food Mexican places out there to choose from! Can't wait for Pancho's to open in September at Downtown Summerlin!"}
{"text":"This is a Las Vegas based chain of a build your own burritos/bowls/tacos. It's similar to Chipotle but with a few additional toppings (e.g. potatoes, sweet potatoes, more sauces). I like that they have a rewards card and kids eat free on Sundays. I've been to 3 locations--they all provided quick service and were very clean."}
{"text":"Chipotle wanna be . Often imitated but never duplicated . Their bowls  are wack sauce . Their meat looks super dry ... this place is super fake  they skimp out on ingredients and charge you more if you ask ....  wth I will never come back  here again ."}
{"text":"Zaba's Mexican Grill is a small chain of  convenient Americanized Mexican fast food eateries, all located in the Las Vegas area. There are about 5 -6 of them now.  Zaba's is like Chipotle, but browner.   No, not browner as in darker Mexicans, ones with more indian blood than Spanish blood. Not at all. Browner because instead of white floured tortillas or white rice, they offer healthier brown.   Zaba's concept is very similar to Chipotle, even the line and service process at the counter is similar. But Zaba's offers more variety. Such as brown rice, wheat tortillas, or fish and shrimp tacos or burritos.   They also have a more colorful decor than the tin can aluminum decor of Chipotle. This one is also larger than most Chipotles, with booths and tables and about 2 to3 times the seating capacity.  I came here to order lunch for a group I was visiting in a nearby office, a lunch and learn session. They had faxed the order in, but the manager was so anal, he couldn't fill the order unless they used their official fax order form! WTF? He faxed back the official form and said he called. Meanwhile, I had talked to him several times about the order, and he didn't tell me this. So I had to call the office, confirm the order, and told him to fill in the blanks that weren't on the order. He had difficulty with this, being a bit OCD or something.  We finally got the order put together and delivered the food. It is pretty tasty, even when it is browner."}
{"text":"Yummy. I love this place so much I come at least once every couple of weeks. I would come more often but I come from big people and need to watch my diet.   I used to go to that other, big chain, place a lot before they had their e-coli scare and since then I've been coming here more. In my opinion the quality is better and the fact that this is a local chain makes it even better.   Place is clean, employees are friendly, food is good and it's local, def can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Depends on who you get for the most part but most of the staff at this location actually give good portions. They are all nice and respectful also.. But lately Rey have been singy.. Just saw a guy ask if he could get more chips in his bag and the girl tried to charge him for another bag.... That's ridiculous there is barely any in there anyway. Just saying"}
{"text":"This was my first experience here and my last ! I waited 22 min just to get to front and order food and there was only 3 people in front of me Service was so slow !! Then cashier tried to charge me for the lady behind me food I got my salad  to go In the bag there was no fork or napkin or dressing Nothing !! It was dry and small and for almost $10 which I wouldn't have minded if it tasted better Never again I'd rather go to chipotle"}
{"text":"I almost didn't go due to the poor reviews, but I received a coupon in the mail. I'm glad I gave them a try I was very happy. I made sure to go before the rush, 11:45am. I ordered a bowl, beef with everything on it (including the green chiles for an extra .50/.60 cents) and thought it was delicious, the ladies behind the counter were extremely helpful and friendly.   Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've driven by here before and wondered if it was any good. Over the weekend I was in the area and looking for something quick when I decided to stop in.   On a Sunday afternoon the restaurant was not busy so we were helped right away. It took me a minute to review the board because they have quite a few options. The variety here is definitely better than Chipotle. Pricing seemed reasonable for their options as well. The inside of the restaurant was clean.  I ordered a bowl with steak and my husband had a burrito. We shared chips and salsa and Zalapeno balls. My bowl was good and definitely tasted fresh, but nothing overly special. My husband had the same opinion of his burrito. The chips and salsa were good. I did really enjoy the salsa. The Zalapeno balls were bland and not something I would order again.  Clean restaurant, reasonable prices, and decent food. This is an A-OK option if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant since it first opened and I cannot explain how much I adore it. I have grown a bond with the manager and the workers and I cannot explain how grateful I am to be apart of this family. I loveeeeeee zabassssssss!!!! :)"}
{"text":"I've ate here several times but today I was very disappointed. The food was cold, I ordered double chicken and they gave me two very small scoops. The rice was old and stuck together in clumps. I will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Right next door to Cupcake Lane Bakery is this wanna-be mexican fast food joint.  All I can say positive is it was fast.  Very limited menu-nothing resembles real mexican and it's really just a Baja Fresh or Chipotle knock-off."}
{"text":"Forget Chipotle, come here for great burritos with a huge variety of fresh ingredients.  The burrito is large enough to feed you for 2-3 meals, definitely worth almost 8 bucks.  Wish you had a frequent customer rewards card haha"}
{"text":"Of my favorite Mexican style Restaurants. You line up and direct them how you want your meal prepared.  The food is fresh. The place is clean. The menu is simple, yet enough choices to find what is right for you. I use my Zaba's reward card, after so many meals, then you get a free meal. I frequent this place often."}
{"text":"The surf & turf burrito is amazing. Though I get it without the hot sauce, its super hot.  The fish tacos another one of my favorites.  They have a rewards program which is great. 11th item is free. Yep, my lunch was fee today!!!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place...it's convenient, fast, and a great lunch spot. Nice outdoor seating, and at lunch time on a Thursday, there was plenty of room inside.  I got a vegetarian salad with fajita veggies, sweet potatoes, corn, black beans and chipotle ranch dressing. The food was good quality, but lacked taste. I love that they have sweet potatoes and regular potatoes as an option for a different texture, but again, they lacked flavor. I found myself hunting for salt or something. Even the dressing, which I was sure would have some punch, was just creamy in texture, not really flavorful.  Another weird thing...the glass that separates you from the food in the ordering line makes it very very hard to hear the staff. Even though the girl that made my salad was speaking very clearly, it was muffled and I had to ask her to repeat things multiple times. This is not the best design.  In theory this place is very similar to Chipotle, but in practice I think they can make some major seasoning improvements to their veggies."}
{"text":"Always amazing!!! Anytime I want a burrito I come here. Its always perfect and always so delicious."}
{"text":"Was craving unauthentic Mexican food and decided to come here one weekday evening. I enjoy the service style (similar to Chipotle). The portion for my bowl was large enough for left overs. I enjoy that they have shrimp and fish options. Food was tasty (although their Chips and Guac weren't the best) and I'd come back for a quick, no nonsense bite to eat."}
{"text":"Zabas. Zabas, Zabas. So far I am stuck with their bowls, burritos (shredded beef) and quesadillas, but I am anxiously awaiting their tacos and rolled tacos. Food is always well prepared and fresh, the staff is very friendly, and the store is always spotless ( That stainless steel Back of House is BEAUTIFUL)   A word of caution: Red Sauce is reserved for satan himself, and while the green looks like a nice and comforting alternative, it will still make your ice water.   O and the queso is to die for. ( Pretty sure there is cream cheese in it, how could it not be?)  Thanks Zabas!"}
{"text":"I love this whole genre of eateries.  Each one has it's pro/con's, and while I like Zaba's it is my least frequented of them all.  I generally get the 3 steak taco's with just cheese and sour cream, as I am a very plain eater.  Zabas steak is nice and spicy, with lots of flavor. As a HUGE fan of Qdoba's Chips and Queso I had high hopes for Zaba's - but I found their queso to resemble melted plastic with peppers in it. There was nothing appealing about it at all to me.  My boyfriend really enjoyed it, but I did not.  The chips also lacked flavor and were just average. I can't remember what burrito my boyfriend got, but he really enjoyed it.  I'd go back, but not spend the money on the Queso.  The service was great and the people were very nice, even though we came close to closing  Let me tell you, my boyfriend was pretty excited about his Modelo with his dinner!"}
{"text":"I moved to LV from the east coast about a year and a half ago. My hometown has an awesome Southwest/Mexican grill that I love, and I just don't think Chipotle is quite the same. I'd been searching for something else of the caliber of my hometown grill, and I finally found it in Zaba's. It's the closest I've come! The staff at this location is generally kind, the food is good, and I enjoy the atmosphere when I eat in. I do think sometimes the chicken is a little too charred for my taste, but I get over it."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is excellent and the staff is as well. Super friendly and eager to help. They never disappoint! Zabas over Chipotle all day!"}
{"text":"Food is good but sometimes the rice is hard I ordered a few times a veggie burrito but the rice I was crunching on to my surprise I had to spit it out (tmi) but just ask them for fresh rice they are friendly as well"}
{"text":"Is this the only Zaba's in Las Vegas? If it is, I am lucky enough to have it located on my side of town. In fact, besides the Chipotle in the UNLV area, this is the closest place I can go to get a nice, big, yum-tastic burrito.  Mainly I go to Zaba's for chicken burritos. I rarely deviate. It's the same with Chipotle and Qdoba. What can I say? I guess I am a creature of habit. But how can I not be when the delicious chicken, rice, beans, salsa, cheese, and sour cream are all delightfully wrapped up in an easy to handle and nom on burrito?  Zaba's is slightly different from other similar Mexican chains. I do believe they are locally owned (sorry if I'm mistaken in that). They also offer wheat tortillas (for no extra charge). I've never had a problem with service at this location. It's quick, efficient and for the most part the staff is friendly.   Still, my favorite burrito-go-to is Qdoba. However, Zaba's IS good and its location so close to me makes it a favorite spot of mine."}
{"text":"Now, I love chipotle, qdoba, etc as much as the next meat-head, gym going, clean eat, health nut as the next. So I'm pleased to say Zabas is SO MUCH BETTER!   I'd never heard of this place when it moved in across the street from where I live. So I tried the fish tacos (they're O.K.) and the chicken burrito. Something about it is just... So...good. Bigger than chipotle maybe? Less ecoli for sure. The price is average for your typical burrito about $8 depending on the protein you choose.  I love it. I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"I'd like to start by saying I LOVE ZABAS! This location, I dunno?! Maybe I was the last customer on a Sunday night, sorry guys but I just finished a 12-HR workday, it's my weekend. I just wanted an awesome burrito. It's like they just didn't give a f..... Asked for wheat she started a regular, questions it then she gave me a wheat tortilla. Didn't ask for lettuce, but I got it anyways. Then she \"wrapped it\" and I get it, these are big burritos, but it was like sloppily throwing a blanket over the ingredients, completely unable to eat it. Bottoms ended up dripping all out and over me. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! I used to live accross the street from Zabas on Durango, this place can't hold a light to that one. I'm so sorry if this is your only Zabas experience!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize that Zaba's was more of a fast food place than a full sit-down restaurant.  Zaba's is what Chipotle and Qdoba strive to be.  Excellent Mexican food, fast service, and a nice atmosphere.  Thankfully, they have plenty of vegetarian options.  The guacamole was delicious and nicely balanced the fajita vegetables.  My only complaint is that you can't see the restaurant from Flamingo, and I drove right past it.  They need a sign facing the street."}
{"text":"Solid place! I use to go here often, now I find myself going once a month.  The lines can be long if you go during rush hour. They don't screw you over and give you tiny scoops of chicken or steak. A normal portion! Usually the food is fresh & tasty. Solid dine-in so you can relax and the place is usually pretty clean."}
{"text":"I've been to many Zaba's and this is my favorite, by far. The girls, and occasional guy, are always super sweet and helpful. They actually take their time to make sure your order is right. This is one of our weekly grub places, and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"I have been here several times.  Never disappointed with anything.  A little pricey for Mexican food but is always fresh and that's what makes it worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I know that quite a few people feel that this place is better than Chipotle but I have to strongly disagree. It's just that when I visit Chipotle everything looks fresh and appetizing at this restaurant all I see is the grease and top layer that the shredded beef and carnitas just sits in. Then some of the other options like the potatoes are cooked until they are solid and dry it's just  really unappealing and takes away the appetite. Workers seemed like nice people which was good but they all act very new as if this place doesn't have much retention on their employees which again makes me just want to walk the extra two blocks to visit Chipotle. Then after you get you food and sit down to eat the decor is pretty nice very warm and we'll lit music isn't too loud so you can conversation fairly easily. But what really bothers me about this place is that the food wasn't very good at all everything tasted processed! Nothing had a fresh zing to it besides the fresh lime and that's what Hispanic food is supposed to be fresh and tasty. I won't be going back as I would rather just go to a place that I know is reliable and being that Chipotle is literally right down the street I'll just stick with them."}
{"text":"Don't get the queso dip, it's terrible. Everything else was OK, but not as good as Cafe Rio"}
{"text":"I'm glad they opened this place up right by me.  Its basically Chipotle.  With few Chipotle locations in Vegas, and their quality going down, yes, admit it, Zaba's is I'd have to say just as good.  You have pretty much all of the same options. I'm sure some of the seasonings or whatever might be different, but still basically the same.  They do however add a potato option to burritos, or I guess whatever you are getting.  My burrito was MASSIVE.  Bigger than Chipotle for sure.  I still love Chipotle, but with none close by me, this is its equal replacement."}
{"text":"We come here all the time. Usually, the food was good and I never really minded waiting for the shrimp to cook. Today, however, was different. My son and I went in to grab a quick bite to eat. He goes to get some Orange Hi-C and the machine sprays him with what is basically orange dye! I tell the employee and she checks and says the tube must be broken sorry. Let me tell my manager. Manager comes out, my son is covered in orange dye. She looks at me like I'm bothering her. I tell her that I'm going to try and wash this out, but what happens if the stains don't come out? She basically says, she can't do anything for me and it's not her fault the machine isn't working?!! Seriously? She then says she will email the district manager and tell her what happened. She didn't get any of my info so not sure what she plans on telling the manager. I ask for her card and the district manager's email. She gives me a generic gm card and says email this, MAYBE the district manager will answer. We come in here all the time and this is the treatment we get. They just lost a long time customer."}
{"text":"First time visiting, and the experience was good. The service was friendly, and the lady interacted with my 4 year old (which he loved). We enjoyed the flavor of the chicken, but the rice was a little bland. I did like the brown rice and wheat tortilla option. I didn't like the queso, but my hubby loved it. They were out of coca-cola which was a bummer. It reminded me of chipotle, which is good too. For 2 adults and 1 kid it cost about $26."}
{"text":"I definitely don't go here as often as I should.  This place is pretty great!  It has been said before but this is a burrito place like many others, but the flavors are superior.  The line moves quickly, the staff are friendly, and the food is fresh and delicious.  The rewards card is definitely worth signing up for, and will pay off.  Their only flaw is that they're not open 24 hours, and it is a rare day I am able to partake of their deliciousness."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to hit up after the gym. It's located near LVAC on the South West Side at I-215 & Flamingo. It has ample seating and there are a few tables outside the front door if you want to eat outside.  You line up to order your food and they make your food to order as you move down the line. You pick the ingredients you want in your burrito, taco, etc....and you pay at the end of the line. I like it here because they have grilled chicken, veggies, brown rice, and other healthy ingredients. You can also get bowls if you don't want the wraps. The portions are more than enough. I can't even finish a burrito there. The tacos are also very good. You get a choice of soft or hard shells.  Stop in if you want a healthy meal after the gym."}
{"text":"Went to try this place for my first time. Wasn't greeted, employees looked at me looked away never mentioned they will be with me or not. After waiting over 5 minutes left guess I  won't be trying this place out especially not in the near future. 4 employees working and not a 1 helped me."}
{"text":"The staff was not friendly or helpful, my order was incorrect and the food was not very good. I also had a  small bone in my chicken that my children who we're sharing with me could have choked on. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I am changing my rating because the owner of Zaba's did try to make it right. I can appreciate any company that is willing to listen to its customers and improve itself. I still believe some staffing changes need to be made at this location, however."}
{"text":"Horrible service, tiny amount of chicken, and the girls there seemed like they hate every customer who doesn't know exactly what they want. I watched about 4 people just walk out due to slow service and rude behavior. If you hate your job get a different one, I now hate this place so I'll be going to qdoba or chipotle or honestly even taco bell would be better. I think the girl who looked miserable was nnaomi or some kinda weird name....good god she was miserable to be there."}
{"text":"Zabas is a chain Mexican restaurant similar to the more popular Chipotle, but with much more flavor.   We've been coming to Zabas for the last two and a half years. It's my toddlers favorite food. The staff is Very sweet and accommodating.  My favorite menu items are simple, taquitos (beef) and a steak quesadilla.  Love their guac and green sauce."}
{"text":"Chipotle. I'm sure it aggravates the owner to be compared to them, but that's what they are.  Not sure who came up with the concept first, but obviously Chipotle is bigger. The food overall was OK. Nothing to write home about and I think the prices are comparable.   The tortilla was a little gummy, but everything seemed to be fresh. The guac was decent."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. First and last time I will ever patronize this place. Learn how to speak english!"}
{"text":"4/29/2018 My buddy and I ordered steak burritos and received food poisoning, thanks for costing 1 sick day of work"}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots in Summerlin for yummy food, everything we have tried has been delicious!  The staff is friendly and service is fast. Also great patio to sit on and watch local shoppers :)"}
{"text":"Extremely dissatisfied with the experience I had last night. I came in and ordered what I always do and asked for a flour tortilla on the side which the lady acknowledged with a nod. As usual she rushed through the process of making mine and my daughters food like she was a robot on an assembly line. When I got to checkout I asked the lady for chips and salsa which she started to do. After we paid and were on our way out of the store I peaked in the back and I didn't see my tortilla so I went back and told that they did not give me the tortilla that I had asked for she then proceeded to tell me that it would be an additional .54  cents on top of what I already paid. I was frustrated but told her to that was fine and said that I can't eat my food without it so go ahead and charge my card she went on to say that they would have to charge me a $1.00 if I wanted to use my card. Since I did not have cash on me I told her to go ahead and give me two large flower tortillas and charge my card. We left and went home to find that they gave me 4 small tortillas and on top of that didn't give us any chips only salsa.  So at this point I had to pay extra for tortillas which were incorrect from the ones I ordered plus paid for chips which we didn't receive. Extremely frustrating! I should not have to babysit every step to make sure everything I requested is done. I did my part to correctly order my food and it is their responsibility to fulfill that order correctly. This was not my mistake it was there's which they should have acknowledged and taken care of instead they were greedy and wanted more money."}
{"text":"Tacos were delicious. Service was friendly and helpful. Plenty of seating. Would stop here again to get lunch. A+"}
{"text":"4.0 Stars  Location Overview: This location can be found on S Grand Canyon and W Flamingo. This location is just as clean and the same when I left it 3 years ago.  Customer Service: The customer service is always on point no matter who's working here and what time of day it is. Even getting out of an intense yoga class looking a mess I still get compliments.  Quality/Quantity: The quality of the food is great. I do genuinely feel that this place and Chipotle sit at the same level. The food is great and the quantity of food is of course way more than enough.  Side Notes: If Chipotle just isnt your thing.... check this out. *I like the queso from here more than Chipotle's*"}
{"text":"I ordered tacos with shredded beef and the meat was cold I would have been better off eating some leftovers in my fridge without reheating them I will never eat at another Zaba's again."}
{"text":"Five stars for the food; 1 star for service. Busy Friday night, and only 3 people at the counter.  The lady taking orders, apparently was the only one over 21, so whenever someone ordered alcohol at the register, she'd have to stop, fulfill the order and ring it up. Leaving us poor, hungry customers in line abandoned.  Ok, finally make it thru line and am ready to pay. Cashier rings up 2 shrimp bowls when I had 1 chix salad and 1 pork salad. Explanation?  They're changing prices on all salads to be the same as the shrimp bowl but just haven't changed register OR the menu. Oh, well!  Sure!  Charge whatever you want and leave that surprise until I'm up at the register. After waiting all that time because you're understaffed or improperly staffed. Nice. Perhaps the profits on the surprise price increase will help pay for additional staff."}
{"text":"We got frustrated with traffic trying to look for Leticia's Mexican Cucina, with patience running thin we opted to go to Zabas instead.   Ordered 2 steak Zaba bowls (they were ok - mediocre really), a kids meal (quesadilla) which my son didn't even eat although he loves quesadilla - (that should have been a sign) and chips and guac. So there sign for chips and guac is $2.99 but if you order a large guac it is $3.79 and chips (stale and probably the worst) is $1.79 which the cashier failed to mentioned that I have to pay for chips if I wanted a larger size guac? What does the regular serving comes in then, a spoonful? I mean what am I going to eat the guacamole with? Seriously a total rip off - $35 for two and a half on a \"fast food Mexican place\" - NOT WORTH IT. I'd go to cafe Rio anyday than this place. Or should have stayed with the original plan..."}
{"text":"Zabas the only place I will go from now on.  There customer service is great and their food is delicious.  I love the punch cards.  Definitely a go to place!  Double points Sunday I love it!!"}
{"text":"Zaba's is a very mediocre version of Chipotle/Cafe Rio but with a few more options than the typical build your own Americanized Mexican food chain. The meat is sub-par at best but I do enjoy their shrimp. Their pico de gallo has no flavor but their medium-hot verde salsa is a great mix of flavor & heat. They do provide more options when it comes to toppings, like regular & sweet potatoes, roasted jalapeños & multiple sauces.   If you're a guacamole fan, like most Chipotle goers do NOT chose Zaba's over Chipotle or Cafe Rio. $1.39 for a small size & boy is it small. I think Zaba's is a good place to try out for a different option of the same but there are definitely better places out there."}
{"text":"5 star experience. 1st time to any Zabas and I got a free menu item in the mail so it was the perfect time to bring the family with small kids in. I had the surf & turf burrito, it was very good and fresh.  The staff was very friendly. We'll come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Zaba's isn't anything fancy.  It's pretty standard \"Chipotle-like\" Mexican food but it really hit the spot after a long day of walking around on the strip.  It was great to find a place offering fresh & healthy, vegetarian-friendly fare.    No complaints."}
{"text":"My son and I just got turned on to this place and it is delicious (by chipotle).  Fresh food, nice workers and a nice setting to enjoy lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Zaba's Mexican Grill is my future husband's favorite place to dine so I eat there often. To be honest I'm not the hugest fan. There aren't many options so I wish he'd favorite another restaurant.   The street tacos are good. I get them every time! The Street tacos come with a Corona which is actually my favorite beer. I do not drink alcohol anymore so what would have been my favorite thing about this Mexican Grill feels like a slap in the face.  They have a specific self-serve beverage bar that is the coolest thing they have and no joke serves probably 1000 soft drinks but I go there to eat Mexican food not to fill up on liquids. I wish they had more food options and more traditional Mexican beverage options other than horchata.   Also when I step up to place my order I feel like I'm at a Mexican deli. It reminds me of ordering from Subway or Pieology."}
{"text":"I frequent Zabas about once a week, and it's been going on a year. Staff is really nice and I'm in love with their fish tacos, salad and guacamole. Items are made fresh and the fish is made to order, so I know it's piping hot. Fresh, light and healthy Mexican fare. I look for the freshness and consistency when I'm spending money for lunch everyday and Zabas has it. Pricing consistent with Baja and Chipotle, could be a tad less. Local business owner, which I believe in supporting. Great job Zabas!"}
{"text":"MARKED IMPROVEMENT!!! Friendly staff, much better food, Scarface lady is gone, music is back on, CLEAN, it's finally the way it should be!! Love it!! Thank you for restoring this fantastic restaurant to it's former glory!! Absolutely in love!!"}
{"text":"Great food,  great pricing and over all you can get a Bucket of beer to drink. Great place to go with friends and I have to say better than chipotle!"}
{"text":"Good food. Similarities to chipotle. Recommended eating here all the food is freshly made too. I don't  recommend the zalepenos . No flavor and it's like a potatoes smashed in side a fritter rolled in a ball deep fried . I like that they have taquitos tacos and burritos. I like the shrimp and the nachos with homemade cheese sauce . They also have healthy ingredients too."}
{"text":"Build your own burrito,  I was happy with the final product.  Better than the big name competition for sure. The employees there were also very nice."}
{"text":"We came to this zabas after receiving a bogo coupon in the mail. We enjoy Mexican food so we thought we'd give it a try. I'd eaten at the zabas inside of the  Plaza hotel before and I thought it was decent at best. We arrived 10 minutes after 8pm and we were turned away immediately and in a rude fashion. What kind of fast food restaurant closes at 8pm in Las Vegas?!? I wouldn't eat at zabas when the direct competition us by far better. Bad service, bad hours, mediocre food."}
{"text":"Late post, but had to compliment on how amazing these people are at catering. Had a meeting at our clinic and they wanted Mexican! Some wanted Rubios others Chipotle but the winner was Zabas. I walked in and the manager Karla and Soledad helped so much. They made the entire experience amazing and my staff loved the food! Thanks I would definitely recommend for any catering and most of it staff has returned for more food!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Zabas for years! I moved near this zabas and visit frequently. It's never really busy which I love because I'm in and out. I've had their rewards card and every so often my meal is FREE! So it's worth signing up if you eat here a lot. Try the chipotle ranch!"}
{"text":"Eh. This place is pretty much like Chipotle in terms of its menu and way of ordering, just with more options on the menu. Taste wise, it is comparable, but the portion is a lot smaller. We got the burrito bowls, which were served on a plate and had a lot less room than Chipotle's tan bowl. And I hardly got any rice!! I felt like I was just eating a bowl of fillings. My bf hardly got any guac when he asked for it, and when he asked for more, the girl said that it would be charged extra. Really? So when someone gets one minuscule portion of guac and asks for just the correct portion, they charge for two. Wow."}
{"text":"This is a overly pleasant experience. The people were very nice and indulged us since this was our first visit to a Zaba's. The food was good, and most importantly for his type of food it was fresh. The kids enjoyed their cheese quesadillas, my wife had the chicken quesadilla. I enjoy led he carnitas rice bowl very much. I would definitely recommend and we will be back."}
{"text":"The queso was amazing.  Had the shrimp burrito, but I think I will stick with steak or chicken moving forward.  Good pricing and convenient location.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing pesto lime shrimp tacos! I was deciding between this and the chicken bowl because both looked amazing! Will definitely come here again and eat!"}
{"text":"The last visit left a dog food taste in my mouth and I wasn't eager to come back. We decided to give it another try.   We got a shrimp bowl and a fish bowl. I'm happy that compared to Chipotle they have more meat, topping and sauce options as it made for a pretty decent bowl. We both liked the fish bowl better which neither of us thought we would (but ordered it because they ran out of shrimp to make two bowls).   I'm open to going to this place again specially since there's healthier options. Seems like there is generally lesser sodium in Zabas food than Chipotle by the taste, but I could be wrong. I've googled around and most nutritional information on this place is incomplete or very general with just a calorie count."}
{"text":"I met clients for a late lunch today at Zabas. The menu is pretty simple and streamlined. There's lots of customizable options available as the employee fills a bowl for you from what you see in the selection behind the glass. That worked out for me as I'm on a food plan for the next 30 days that restricts a lot of the things that you'd be worried about eating at a Mexican food restaurant like beans and rice. I was able to get lots of fresh grilled vegetables, chili peppers, a good selection of grilled and shredded Meats and then all sorts of salsa, guacamole, and other condiments you could want.   The service was good. The gal that was helping us was friendly and patient as I hadn't been there before. She let my dining companion have a sample of any meat that she requested to taste before buying. I like it when casual dining restaurants will let you do that.  My one complaint that I have is almost every table that we wanted to sit at needed to be wiped down.  The bench seats had stray pieces of rice on it. It was 2 o'clock in the afternoon so lunch rush wasn't an excuse. I would think that at that time of day there would be plenty of time to do some tidying up after the last diners.  There are a lot of restaurants in that shopping center area. You really need to be on point if you're going to capture more of the casual dining market share walking by."}
{"text":"Finally made a trip here last night and enjoyed my chicken and pork burrito with queso sauce, sour cream, lettuce, cheese, brown rice and black beans on a WHEAT tortilla. I was waiting to see when one of these Mexican grill joints were going to start using some other types of tortillas... there are some great flavors out there. Seeing how Zabas is the only one I have been to that offers an option besides a white tortilla. They also had brown rice as an option besides white rice which was actually a nice change. The queso sauce here is not as good as Qdoba and they charge you extra for it here (which I don't believe Qdoba does) so that is a big reason for the -1 star. They charged me $1.25 for what rang up as a SM. QUESO for the half a scoop of queso sauce I asked for on my burrito.  Overall the burrito was good... very flavorful. A burrito with queso sauce and a regular drink ran me $10. Bit pricey but at least it was good. The decor is nice and it was very clean. The location is not that great for them and I'm sure it hurts business but once you get to it its worth a try. I will be going back and giving a second opinion."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this Zabas there's always something that smells in here compared to the other Zabas I've been to. It smells like a dirty towel....   Tonight I went here to get my usual a steak salad. Guacamole always comes with it and when the girl was finishing with my bowl. I asked her for some guacamole. She says that they're completely out! Absolutely none left -_- wish I would've knew from the beginning so I could go to chipotle instead and get a bowl with guac over there. I absolutely love guac!   So after leaving Zabas, I decided to drive to the grocery store to buy some guac. to eat with my salad. When I come home I can't believe how cheap they are about pouring the salad dressing!!! Wish I would've saw it when she grabbed it out of the fridge. It's like seriously whoever poured it has never eaten a salad or something cause it was not enough. -_- from now on I think I'll just avoid going to this location. There's always some type of issue with this location whenever I get my food"}
{"text":"This is right around the corner from me, and I go there often.   The only reason why I would give this place 3 stars is because of the service.  Otherwise, the food is good.   It's my #1 choice over any other fast Mexican food around here. Their meat spices are good, everything is always fresh and I LOVE their queso here. A lot of people don't like this type of queso, but I love white cheese queso.  The nachos are always my #1 favorite. Other than that, I usually get the rice bowls.   The reason I have a distaste for the customer service -   There is a couple of ladies there that are almost always rude. They give you a look like you're inconveniencing them and they act like they hate their job. It's cool, I understand. I hate my job too. But, I don't treat my customers like shit because it's my fault I hate my job, not theirs.   There is one in particular that always is hateful. She never says hello, never asks what she can help me with and she has always screwed up my order. I tell her what I want, and she always puts something else. I hate to be a bother, so I never complain and I finally told her last time that that's what not what I had said. She seemed annoyed and I told her it was okay and that I didn't want her to change it. I don't like being rude to people, even if they're rude to me first.   It sucks because I really don't like the other places around here, so I keep going back. I just mentally prepare myself before going in knowing my experience won't be the best. Maybe it's just me..."}
{"text":"Such great food always fresh the staff is always friendly and very knowledgeable definitely recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 58/100  I've been to other locations throughout the years, but it was my first time visiting this one. A chain mexican grill, like Chipotle. Service and food was decent.   I got the carnitas bowl (slow-carb style, 4 Hour Body) -- no rice, black beans, carnitas, veggies -- onions, tomatoes, a few lime wedges.   I love spicy and can handle the heat but it was a bad choice to add both sauces, as it was too spicy for me! The carnitas was decent, not bad.   Lots of booth seating, not busy or crowded. We went around 7pm on Thursday night.   Beers and a few alcoholic beverages served here as well."}
{"text":"The food isn't all that great as I hoped it would. I ordered a steak burrito with pinto beans, brown rice, pico de gallo, sour cream, and cheese. The beans didn't taste fresh, the rice was a little hard, and the steak didn't look all that great either. I can honestly say the franchise Mexican grills taste better."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for the amount of meat they give you.   This place is such a rip off.   The chicken was mostly gristle and fat."}
{"text":"It's cheap, fresh, and delicious! Far as Mexican, fast food goes- I perfer this place over Chipotle and Baja Fresh. Their guacamole is actually guacamole and is really yummy... most places it's some green stuff not something I want to eat. The chips are better then other places as well in my opinion. I really think far as chain food restaurants go this one needs to be around more areas of town!"}
{"text":"It's your regular Mexican Fast Food.  Really only good to order and take it back to work or home.  I really like their salads here and it's all I'll order.  But, after my friend found a hair in her food, I kinda freaked out.  Because of that, I don't have the appetite to order from them anymore.  Just the thought of it makes me want to gag."}
{"text":"I live in the east coast, which means that are go to Mexican take out is Chipotle. I tried Zabas for the very first time today here in Vegas. I had a chicken and shrimp bowl. The taste was amazing! Tangy flavor and very tasteful. I wish we had a Zabas back home!"}
{"text":"This fast food spot is A-OK. Nothing spectacular in the most. You simply order your food and pay for it. The decor is decent, and the setup is similar to that of Cafe Rio or Chipotle. Customer service was below sufficient. I didn't feel welcomed while ordering. Also, they had a couple items that needed to be refilled. They charge for everything and the check-in redemption reward was not honored. The cashier said there isn't an option to get a free brownie anymore."}
{"text":"If you are looking for fresh food tasty and delicious and friendly staff you have to visit Ori'Zaba's at Maryland & Silverado Ranch. They have Vegan options and lots of combinations. They make the salsas every Day."}
{"text":"This location was clean, food was quickly made and service was very friendly. The only thing that drives me insane is the common containers of open plasticware. Wrapped utensils are just the sanitary thing to provide."}
{"text":"The food was ok. The overall service and store cleanliness was lacking. They could do some major customer service improvements to lift the overall guest experience."}
{"text":"Man I love this place. Hilmaris is the GM and she is always so friendly and remembers my name. They put a friendly and warm spin on the familiar experience of ordering Mexican food. The food is tasty and well prepared. I love the chips and queso and the shrimp is always delicious."}
{"text":"First time here got a carnitas burrito cost 7.49. Pretty big and tasty . Now I added the hot salsa which was pretty darn spicy. So be aware! Added guacamole $1.59 it was fresh but which they balance it correctly when spreading it to burrito.  Got a large drink to my order 2.29. Not bad for a big tasty meal. Next time I'll try a chicken bowl. Carnitas were good but a little to salty for me."}
{"text":"I get the chicken bowl with fried potatoes for carry-out almost daily. Its flavor is the closest to a homey everyday Brazilian dish that I can find in the area. Service is friendly (except for one employee with an annoyed face and robotic voice). If there are more than 2 people in line, service somehow feels slow and inefficient. Parking is also a problem. There is a to-go parking right in front, but it is often taken so I end up parking in the garage. I'm happy, though, that I found this alternative to Chipotle. Zaba's actually tastes better than Chipotle and it is a shorter drive from my house."}
{"text":"This place is the closest thing I can find in Las Vegas to Freebird's World Burrito (which is awesome). It would be spectacular if they would add Mexican/Spanish rice to the rice choices."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Menu states clearly that kids menu item receives side of small chips.  Lady claimed \"not for the meal I ordered\".  Come on lady, I just want a small side of chips.  Why not just make a customer happy and give me the small chips.  The menu clearly states that I will receive it with my order.  I hate when places make up rules on the fly like this.  I'll never return here again...you had your chance."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and the area was nice and clean! This place is just like Chipotle, you tell them you want a bowl, tacos, quesadilla, or a burrito then you get your fillings of your choice. I got a bowl: white rice, mild sauce, steak, corn, guac, onions, and lettuce. My fiancè got the three tacos with steak, chicken, and carnitas. Our food cost $20 with tax. Guacamole is extra ($1.95.) I think it's a bit more expensive than Chipotle and they give you less portioning than Chipotle. The taste of the food was not bad, their mild sauce tasted weird but I liked the rice and steak. The guacamole was plain, I didn't see or taste any mixed in spices, etc."}
{"text":"Food was great service was ok, radio they had playing was saying tonight I'm F***ing you.  I'll make sure to come back here if my kid starts saying it at school. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Good but overpriced. Burrito is filled plenty. We had the surf and turf (steak & shrimp) which is fun, I don't see that at many other burrito spots. Burrito was $12 which seemed a little over priced. Also got the street cork which was $4 and change.  Meal ended up costing $25. Every guest that came in spoke Spanish so maybe it's a little more authentic?  Overall food is good but overpriced."}
{"text":"The best Zabas I've been too. Awesome service, friendly staff and clean environment. The other zabas on flamingo and Pecos made me ill. I was not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Best burrito chain in town! Their rewards program is awesome! Free kid's meals on sundays. Their salsas are bomb! Their chicken is never fatty. The potatoes as an option is awesome! Prices are great!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've only checked in here twice, because we must have eaten at this location at least once a week when I was pregnant! This is our go-to spot for a quick, easy and satisfying lunch, and always goes over well when people are visiting. The staff is extremely friendly and the food never disappoints.  My personal pick is the fish tacos on corn tortillas, which come with cabbage, pico de gallo, a drizzle of chipotle ranch and a wedge of lime. Ask for sides of chipotle ranch and hot salsa on the side and you're set. Om nom nom!"}
{"text":"I'd say this place is a hit or miss!! First and 2nd time I tried this place I got a rice bowl... I thought it was really good! Then the 3rd time it didn't taste as good as the first few times so I figured maybe it was a different cook or just a bad night. So I gave it another try and it ended up tasting bland and the chicken was disgusting with those nasty chewy pieces and the rice was hard. After that I was turned off and just don't have the desire to go back for now. Maybe eventually I'll give it another try. The only thing that's always good is the Zalapeño balls and the cilantro pesto sauce!"}
{"text":"The staff was so nice but the food didn't taste good at all! Just had no flavor and some of the sauces were watery. Their other location on flamingo road tastes better than this one...I'd say try the other location- but, just warning it's a hit or miss!! Maybe you'll be lucky!"}
{"text":"White corn tortillas are not very good. The chicken is dry and the sour cream was warm. Not a very good place to eat."}
{"text":"Food is decent like I remember from back in the day when the South Eastern location was opened.  So stingy with what you order. Didn't get rice, and wanted extra cheese. Ordered chips and salsa. They rang me up for 2 sides of cheese and extra salsa. Not even Chipotle is cheap like Zabas, must be since it is locally owned. Burrito, 2 sides of chips and salsa, as well as a drink- almost $20. WOW"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of zabas. The food is really fresh. My go to is the cheese quesadilla on wheat. I put guac, pico, and sour cream on every bite. Its the way to go. Also down with the fish tacos and carne Assad quesadilla. Their brownies are actually really good too."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are amazing. Awesome dinner! No wonder they were voted best fish tacos in Vegas."}
{"text":"This Zaba's is wonderful! Firstly, and very important,  the food is always fresh. I like a veggie burrito :) But what also keeps me coming back is the friendly and accommodating staff. Not once, have I had a poor experience with staff. I think that speaks to managements training."}
{"text":"I love Zaba's and was so sad when the one in Henderson on Eastern closed. Luckily, I started working near this one a few days a week and I'm getting my Zaba's fix again! They have excellent options for burritos - my favorite are the regular and sweet potatoes! The burritos are always way bigger than the ones I get at Qdoba.   If you get the Zaba's card each meal will get you closer to a free burrito. The service is decent here but the lines at lunch time on the weekdays are RIDICULOUS. Sometimes they're out the door. The employees do a great job of keeping things moving but, with that much volume, it's hard. I waste a lot of my lunch break just standing in line.   The place looks small when you first walk in but there's extra seating in the back and some outdoor seating, which is great when the weather is nice.   Zaba's far surpasses Qdoba and Chipotle in taste and options. Get here before the lunch rush and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry... this place just does not compare to Chipotle. I don't mean it's not as good, they just aren't comparable. With that out of the way, the food was just ok, the flavor wasn't really there for me. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but I tried the chicken bowl, queso, civeche and the corn. The corn was the best part, queso was terrible and civeche was also just o.k. For $26 I'd rather have had something nicer."}
{"text":"This place by far has the worst service in Vegas. Have tried to many times to count to allow them to redeem them selves and yet they seem to always fail. Always running out of food employees rude constantly get complaints and still have some of the same ones.  Tonight waited in line for near 8 minutes to not be greeted, didn't say hello we will be right with you nothing. This place is a disgrace to local business owners ended up walking out and for good. Never will I or anyone I know come back"}
{"text":"I am hardly ever in the mood for Mexican food and can be a big downer when it comes to dashing other peoples hopes about obtaining this style of cuisine. I had worked in a now defunct Mexican stand within a casino for a good portion of my high school years and had many coworkers who made awesome home-style dishes, so I do not jump for joy when I go to chain restaurants. My stomach still yearn for the chili rellenos, sweet tamales, and chicken mole this Godsend of a lady use to make.   My friend swayed me to go here after our half hour dilemma of pinpointing what we were in the mood for. I will spare you the details because no one will ever be able to follow this train of thought. All you need to know is that Zaba's offers whole wheat tortillas and brown rice. If you are finicky about what you eat and want items that will stay with you longer throughout the day then this is the place for you. For the most part everything else on the menu is pretty standard and comparable to Chipotle, but I am a sucker for more fiber.   Needless to say, I got the vegetarian burrito with a whole wheat tortilla, brown rice, black beans, corn, hot salsa, cheese, guacamole, and lettuce. The veggies were not the star of the show because they had lost most of their integrity sitting in the pan. Otherwise the burrito was perfect.   I received a suggestion to get the chicken burrito the next time because it is suppose to be their best. I am also a huge fan of barbacoa, so I will have to at least try this place two more times."}
{"text":"Zaba's has to be my favorite lunch spot. The service and food are both outstanding. This is a well managed business and deserves a shout out!"}
{"text":"3 star average for my beloved Zaba's?  Say it ain't so!   I had to scan through all the reviews to get myself prepared to battle and defend Zaba's honor but, you know what, I know where most of them are coming from.  This location just opened in April, and even I, the most diehard of Zaba's fans since I've been visiting their establishments since I was a UNLV student over 15 years ago can admit that I had some shaky experiences here early on.   I think a few times that month after they opened I literally drove across town to the next nearest Zaba's to get my fix.    I'm happy to report that half a year later, everything is fine and well now!   The shredded beef is consistently seasoned to my liking (a problem early on), and some of the newer staff members then were a little light-handed on portions and have since come around to providing more bang for the buck.    My usual order is a shredded beef salad with corn and green salsa, but on the weekends I splurge a little with burritos or tacos.   and sour cream.  and cheese.  and chips.  Okay so I always get chips.   I find myself not getting the chicken at this location as much as I used to get it at some of the other ones.  I tend to like it when it gets a nice seasoned char, and more often than not here it doesn't look like it has that nice burnt exterior.   I'm a charred chicken connoisseur.   I'll be honest though I find myself not being upset at the chicken because deep down my heart lies with the shredded beef anyway.   I like Chipotle's Barbacoa but find Zaba's version usually superior, especially when it's seasoned well which as of late it has been.   Then the green salsa here is better than any Chipotle offers IMO.     My only 2 disappointments are as follows:    1)  The chips are tasty, but I feel like there's never enough salt on them here. Finding a salty chip in a bag here sometimes is as difficult as finding meaningful lyrics in a Justin Bieber song.    2) Coca Cola Freestyle.    PEOPLE!   It's 2015.   This isn't a thing anymore.  But I swear every 5 or 6 visits I get someone who stares at it in amazement like it's a portal to Narnia.   Or you get someone who has to examine every option of flavor of Diet Coke Zero before settling on Regular.   Clearly Barqs , Dr Pepper, or Cherry Coke are the only acceptable options anyhow.     I've given it praise before, but let my close out this review by telling you how much I love the ZIP program they do here.  For every 10 entrees you purchase, you get a free one.   The best part is double point Sundays.   So if you make it a point to come in Sunday and order say, 2 entrees, you're 40% of the way to a free entree.   I come here so much I average a free entree every week and a half.   Another win for the common man."}
{"text":"In the age old war between Zaba's and Chipotle, Zaba's always wins out for me.  So much so that while the Eastern location which is closest to me is closed down in preparation of a new location opening soon, I drove all the way to this location instead of just settling for the Chipotle down the street.   That's partially not true as I was somewhat in the area before deciding to get some take-out for lunch, but it was definitely much less convenient than going the Chipotle route and dammit I still took it.  This location seemed much nicer aesthetically than any other Zaba's I've been to.   That's not to say that they usually aren't nice because they are, but something about this one just seemed a step ahead.   It was packed for lunch but the employees were on top of their game in within a few minutes I was out the door with a couple Zaba Bowls to go.     I did my usual, a zaba bowl with brown rice, shredded beef, corn, green salsa, and lettuce.   It's about as healthy a meal I can put together at any of these fresh-mex joints that I can still enjoy.   I found it to be a good version of the same thing I've gotten 100 times at the Eastern location.   The shredded beef was nicely spiced (I've had it on occasion lack spiciness which I believe is due to it not being stewed long enough to soak it all in) and the veggies were fresh and as tasty as veggies can be.   My rice was a little mushier than I normally like it, so that was my only minor gripe.   I also shared a bag of chips and they were spot on as usual.     A good value became even better recently with the introduction of the Zaba's reward card with which every 10 entrees purchased you get the 11th free.   Points are doubled on Sundays.   Since I go to the other location at least 2-3 times a week and buy for 2, I average a free entree every 2-3 weeks.   WHAT HAS CHIPOTLE DONE FOR ME LATELY?   Exactly."}
{"text":"Way better then crapotle the food has way more flavor and so much down home goodness plus you can get a lot of different items the queso sauce rocks and the rice has flavor to it... Maybe the fact that they're locally owned and operated means they just pay better attention to detail with their spices Uber bomb food for my $$$"}
{"text":"Very fresh and generous portions!  Staff were friendly and attentive. If you asked for \"a lil extra\" they would accommodate your request and not charge extra! The shrimp are delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place was better than I anticipated. I had the burrito and it was really good. The employees were really friendly and the place was super clean which is what I look for in food establishments. I will definitely go back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"My daughter and I have been Zaba fans for  years and have followed them to several locations in the Las Vegas/Henderson valley.  We have frequented the newest location a LOT.  Each time we go it seems to get worse and worse.  Today was the FINAL straw.  First of all, I asked for two salads to go.  One veggie, one meat.   As I'm speaking the girl kept putting in the wrong ingredients.  She tossed the bowls over to another girl who did not understand English and obviously could not speak a word of it.  The new girl couldn't understand red sauce.  The third girl working the register came over and finished off the order. (still incorrectly)  When I asked for the special celebrating 9 years in business, I was told I had to have the printout.  I had left the printout in the car and I was on a lunch hour and didn't have time to go back and get it, much less hold up the line.  The girl behind the register would not give me the special even though I frequent this Zaba's a lot and have been a good customer ever since Zaba's opened in Vegas!    As I was telling my daughter what happened she mentioned that last week she had been overcharged but was on her lunch hour and said nothing.    This is not the place we want to do business with anymore, especially since there are other great Mexican restaurants in the same block.  I am sorry to leave Zaba's but their service at this location has been HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"This seems to be exact duplicate of Chipotle. Nothing original, it's exact copy of Chipotle. The food was good and service was good but it lacked originality. Also the food was little expansive compare to Chipotle, if you are going to copy somebody, do it better."}
{"text":"We've just moved into the neighborhood around Zabas and coming from the East coast we needed a new Qdoba equivalent!  Food: I love the bowl options and do the salad since you get lots of lettuce at the bottom. GREEN SALSA = MONEY and super limey like I like it!  Service: friendly and nice when I'm super chatty to start with lol.  Atmosphere: clean tables and \"amenities\" for customers  This will be a regular \"spot\""}
{"text":"Zabas hands down puts chipotle to Shame. One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. Great flavors, selection, and service."}
{"text":"Went in this afternoon to get ripped off apparently. Me and my wife ordered 2 chicken bowls and to our surprise they give us barely any food. Did not give my wife what she wanted. Told the girl at the register we did not want a combo which add chips salsa and a drink and got charged for it anyway. Also my wife did not receive any salsa for her chips. Rushed and told to pay for terrible service. Seems to be a trend in this store / restaurant. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"Way way better than Chipotle. The quality of meat and the choices of ingredients are awesome so there are many combinations of entrees to get. The fish tacos are the best and freshly fried and never sits out. The surf and turf burrito is awesome too and try the zalapeno balls which are like little balls of potatoes with jalapenos and dressing over it. Very busy at lunch time though"}
{"text":"$4.31 total for 2 tacos and a PBR; that deal can't be beaten around this area. Shredded beef tacos were delicious. The layout looks like Chipotle, but cheaper prices, food seems just as good, a little more menu variety here. Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"I pay extra for guacamole so I can taste the guacamole, I find it almost insulting the amount of guacamole that was put on my burrito. Also I was supposed to receive a free meal based on the point system and all of a sudden an email is required when you can clearly see I have a reward for a free meal. Extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"So about 3 years ago I decided to inaugurate my Fish Taco blog with someplace close to home and at an establishment that I was already familiar with. Cheating? Nah, I called it familiarizing myself with this whole bloggering process...  Zaba's has a few locations around town and I like it because they make everything from scratch, including the sauces like the Chipotle Ranch, which is awesome. It's no secret, to people that know me, that I am a stickler for fresh and additive-free ingredients.  Anyway, I got the usual order of their fish tacos, which consists of 3, with your choice of flour or corn tortillas.  Each taco consists of 1 tortilla (I actually prefer 2 tortillas when it comes to corn due to the heightened disintegration rate of the tortilla), 1 piece of what was explained to me as \"Premium Cod\" shaped like a rectangular bratwurst that has been battered and deep fried, a lot of what you would expect from a standard Pico de Gallo, a healthy squirt of their Chipotle Ranch dressing, a pile of shredded green cabbage and about 3 or 4 wedges of lime. I often attempt to extract juice from these limes, as it makes a nice boost of flavor, but sometimes I believe they might just be for decoration as I can seldom seem to get anything out of them.  I would suggest eating these at the location because the tortilla disintegration was well under way upon arriving home after my 5 minute journey from the location nearest my house. Flour tortillas, of course, have proven to be hardier...but I will always prefer the corn tortilla for fish tacos until something sways me otherwise.  One interesting tidbit that I feel should be mentioned, is that this place is 'burrito bar' style like Chipotle or Qdoba's. That being said, the fish tacos take a few extra minutes to make, so after ordering you find yourself in a position to awkwardly find some place to hang out around the cash register while everyone in line behind you soon become people in front of you. Sort of weird momentarily, but if your social skills are well adapted enough to enable you to hang around not looking stupid, then this shouldn't be a problem.  One order - $7.59 Single taco - $2.69  Ingredients: Battered premium cod, pico de gallo, chipotle ranch sauce, green cabbage, flour or corn tortilla with a few wedges of lime on the side.  Good stuff. I would recommend it as well as return for more. As I have been..."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and honestly makes me forget Chipotle exists. The only downside is DO NOT EVER cone on a Sunday. Kids eat for free on Sunday so it is nothing but unsupervised kids. The kids run around and don't use their inside voices. This causes the staff to be perpetually distracted and you have to yell at the top of your lungs for them to hear what you want."}
{"text":"Not fast food but GOOD food fast!!! Great service always with a smile. Everything here is tasty and fast, fresh. Great spot for a quick lunch while shopping on a beautiful day. Great work everyone."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed tonight for the first time since eating at this Zaba's...the service was questionable...the barbacoa beef on my bowl was so salty I couldn't finish it...my son had a burrito with steak & says it's like chewing on a salt lick.  They messed up my daughter in law order twice even...  Only good thing about this is the craving is gone...replaced by a headache...I'm sad now!"}
{"text":"Our Family loves Zabas. Always fresh, tasty, & satisfying. The reward program eventually pays off as well in addition to emailed coupons. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have been going to Zaba's for about three years now. I have gotten everything from a steak burrito to fish tacos. I have never had a bad experience here. The staff is very friendly. Some employees have been there since I started going and they are always fabulous. You can have more of a conversation than, \"What would you like on your tacos?\". Everything is grilled fresh and you can taste it. The cilantro pesto is exceptional. It tastes great on everything. Today, I stopped by for lunch and got a vegetarian burrito. I added sweet potatoes to it and I was a little leery but the guy serving me told me it was really good. He was right!! I think Zaba's beats Chipotle any day."}
{"text":"I think they recently changed their brown rice and now it is never thoroughly cooked. Always crunchy. And sometimes the food is waaaaay too salty."}
{"text":"Good food, little more expensive than chipotle and you get less. Not that anyone in America needs any larger portions given the average size of obese America lol. TERRIBLE,  customer service from the two ladies I see working here on a daily basis. They should be in the back doing paperwork, being in the front of the house involves personality and friendliness. Doesn't surprise me why this place has 2.5 stars, they'll never be able to compete with chipotle with that business motto"}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite Zabas! Best food and customer service! I can't wait for my next Vegas trip to go eat at my favorite place. I would truly recommend this place to anyone visiting Vegas"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is the worst food I a ever eaten. No flavor whatsoever waste of my $30. The only good this was the drinks. Nasty ads food be lucky I gave them 1 star and only cause of the drink."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were the bomb! Crispy and breaded, a nice cabbage slaw, ancho sauce all wrapped in a warm flour tortilla.    Portions were huge, 3 of those tacos will fill you up!    Cool little hang out just to relax on a lunch break."}
{"text":"I've gone here for years. Went tonight after a heartbreaking UNLV loss. I get a Zaba Bowl each time. I love the fact that they have brown rice. The last time I was there I ordered the hot salsa. It was too hot. I did it again this time and decided not to eat it. I asked for another bowl of rice and beans so that I could transfer the shrimp and other sides from the bed of fire. They didn't charge me for the extra bowl. That was cool. It's fast, the food is good, and the servers are are friendly. I'll continue to go back. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Zabas by far is my favorite place to get my own tacos and burritos. I honestly like this place better than chipotle and I guess that's a big deal. I like the meat better, the guacamole better. The flavors here are just more my taste. Love this place since day 1."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location, since the doors first opened. I have seen the high turn over rate in managers and employess. Which isn't a big deal, as long as they treat the guest properly. Now my issue is why do you (zabas) keep increasing your prices, slowly and slowly, next thing you know my $16 for two people turned into $25 over the last 4-5 yrs. A Lil ridiculous, to hustle that way. You lost me a long time customer. Probably not a big deal since you guys are located in a yuppie kind of area anyways."}
{"text":"This is a fresher version of Chipotle without the food poisoning.  In my opinion there are better locations (such as Henderson) but the food is usually good quality.   You can get a chicken bowl built to your liking for 11 bucks with a drink.   The service at this location is mediocre but not incompetent.  The dining area is small and laid out very weird.  I like Zabas but this is my least favorite location to date."}
{"text":"It is Zabas.  You know what to expect and there are no surprises to be had here.  This is Chipolte with a bit more quality.   The staff is friendly enough but a bit heads down.  The place is clean and tidy.     They have bowls, tacos, burritos, etc......  Nice place for a quick lunch.  There are better, there are worse."}

{"text":"Haven't gone to Chipotle since I tried Zaba's. Love the quality, freshness and options. Only downside is pricing as it is a bit high for certain things like shrimp salad."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Zabas for at least 10 years now, and have been visiting the Silverado ranch location once or twice a week since it opened. I am a fan. They have really stepped up their game recently with the new management. Tons of new options and discounts, and quality seems to have improved. Also, the customer service it top notch now, and if you see someone in there that's giving subpar service, good chance you won't see them on your next visit   I used to be about 50/50 Chipotle/Zabas, but recently Chipotle's meat has been bland, so about 20/80 now."}
{"text":"Good eats! I came here for lunch. Ordered the Zabas bowl and fish tacos. The Bowl was great. The black beans and brown rice are good.  The chicken was moist and not dry and the guacamole was fresh!    The fish tacos while good and a good size were average. Nothing to write home about but still good.   I would still recommend this place and will be back.   The staff are friendly and the food fast and good."}
{"text":"I came by on Wednesday around noon and the restaurant was clean and was greeted by a nice gentleman. Zabbas is pricier but the portion was a very good size.  I will come back again!"}
{"text":"So I had not eaten here in a while and I was craving  fish tacos so I decided to stop in. They seem to be under new ownership which allows them to branch out to other states so the name has changed slightly. No complaints about service or the food. My complaint is when you check in, there is a freebie for a brownie if you purchase a drink. Well, everyone knows how much the cell service sucks at DTS, so I was not able to check in till I sat down and could find some bars on my phone. I walked up to redeem my freebie and was told \"no, that I could not redeem\" I was like what???? The guy was like, you needed to show that when you were paying for your food. Duh! I would have if the damn mall had cell service!! Needless to say, they have lost a star in my book and I may never return at this point. No appreciation for Yelpers at this place....."}
{"text":"Oh zabas. I loved you, I really did! Did you see the excitement in my first review?   You're normally great but tonight I went in at 5:30 and things were different. The girl helping me was throwing out some rice and scraped the bowl clean and then hit the serving spoon on the side of the trash can and stuck it straight into the new rice! What!?!? I should have left right after that but I don't ever get rice with my salad.  Everything, and I mean everything on my salad was awful. The chicken was cold, the black beans were sitting in their disgusting thick juice for way too long and totally ruined the delicious flavor of your cilantro pesto. The sweet potatoes were old and stale. I am so sad, I am always astounded when I see the reviews here because I normally have a great meal every time I come. Then again I normally go for lunch when the food is maybe fresher?   Either way, I probably won't be back..."}
{"text":"Great food. Great Service. Lady with Blue Hair was Wonderful. Will come back. Store was clean and employees were knowledgeable"}
{"text":"Worst Zaba's in town!!! Staff is unprofessional and too busy talking about their personal life while making my bowls and their portions are so small. Zaba's is my favorite out of all the competition but unfortunately I'll be driving the extra 10 min. For better customer service. Shame on you Zaba's!!! Don't even want to give this place 1 star."}
{"text":"As stated, another Chipotle knockoff. 3 shredded beef tacos with just cheese and a small soda was $11.33. The shredded beef did have good flavor but the portion was ridiculous. The lady divided a half scoop of beef for 3 tacos. Might be lucky to total 1 oz of meet. Ridiculous portions, ridiculous price! If you don't add all of the add-ons, this place is a waste of your time and a waste of money. I'll stick to the plain flavors of Roberto's for half the cost..."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing here!!  We ordered the fish tacos, suggested by a worker, and they were delicious. The fish was freshly cooked, the sauces and veggies were fresh, and the corn tortillas were tender.   While the food was absolutely delicious, we were particularly impressed by one of the workers, Alex. He was quick to suggest good items, kindly inquisitive about our experience and food satisfaction, and clearly dedicated to his job!!!  Great work hiring your staff, Zabas!"}
{"text":"Came here on a late Sunday night after visiting a few shops nearby. I've never heard of Zaba's and so me and my friend decided to check it out.  Right when we walked in, the first thing we had to search for was the menu (which was posted above the kitchen) and to our surprise it was much similar to Chipotle.  The line wasn't too long nor too short so we had time to decide what to pick. You can customize your order OR you can pick Zaba's favorite meal(s) that include tacos, burritos, a bowl, quesadilla, nachos and a salad.  My friend chooses to customize her 3 carnitas tacos while I chose Doug's Surf and Turf Burrito (one of the favorites- $10).  The workers knew what goes inside the Surf and Turf and magically worked on my burrito, putting the necessary ingredients such as the shrimp, potatoes, pico de gallo, guacamole, rice, hot salsa, and steak (talk about a mouth-flavoring burrito!) My friend, on the other hand, had carnitas, corn, pico de gallo, rice and beans on all three of her tacos. The server generously piled the toppings on top of the corn tortillas and my friend couldn't finish her third taco. And as an additional treat (we always get this at Chipotle), we got the Chips and Guacamole ($2.39). Chips had a slight lime flavor and the guacamole wasn't as spectacular as I'd hope so {Chipotle won this round}. Lastly on my receipt, we got 2 large fountain sodas (est. $5). All in all, I paid $24 for a tummy of two and left the restaurant full and satisfied (she's still a chipotle fan-Grrr lol)  I see why Zaba's is slowly climbing up to Chipotle not because of similarity, but more of a slight, unique twist it has. Zaba's has more of a kick and spicyness that Chipotle tends to lack and I'm all about full-on flavor.  Zaba's also has fish tacos, shrimp tacos, and nacho- which gives a variety of opportunities for those who dread the typical Chipotle meat menu.   I'll be coming here more often to explore their menu. Great place to stop by at Downtown Summerlin Mall if you're nearby! Highly recommend =)"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch often.  It's just down the road from my work and it's fast, convenient, and delicious.  I have never had an issue with service or the cleanliness of the establishment."}
{"text":"Went yesterday cuz I was craving chipotle but didn't want to drive all the way to one.  Minus one star cuz they charge extra for queso. I got a queso chicken burrito(5 of 5), chips (3of5), guac (4of5), and some pico (2of5) and the total was 10 bucks.  There were two half naked sluts in line in front of me and i swear they took 15 minutes to order. They asked for a sample of EVERYTHING on the line and had specific instructions about the placement of each individual shrimp on their salad. One of them asked for her corn to be \"evenly sprinkled\" instead of just tossed on her salad. The other one pointed at each food item and asked one at a time if they were organic.  Kudos to the very patient Zabas staff for not hopping over the counter and bludgeoning one of those bimbos with a burrito."}
{"text":"My family and I love Zaba's. However, tonight we ordered a cheese quesadilla kid's meal and they  forgot to put the cheese in it! In addition to that, they would not give us the kids meal price for the chocolate milk (first time they did this in the last twenty times we've been here) while my three year old was sick at home. The receipt machine was not working and they could not give us one for our purchase. Disappointed in our favorite burrito restaurant. Very unpleasant experience, will be visiting Chipotle for their phenomenol guest service."}
{"text":"Very fresh and delicious food,first time here so I wasn't sure what to order but the employees were very polite and helpful. The food was very delicious nice crisp vegetables and a helpful serving of meat as well I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"We've been going to this location for years. Managers come and go and we've always loved the workers.  They have served with a smile and could probably guess what we would order next. But I'm pretty much done. They have a new rude manager. Prices have gone up but this manager has all the same workers serving chincy small portions. She has no personality and makes me not want  to come back. Today we went for lunch. Food was as good as ever but of course not much of it. Chip bags have gotten even smaller, hard to imagine. Beans and meat portions are tiny.  Hello, the whole reason people come to Zaba's and pay that kind of money is to eat a little healthier, not  to load up on only carbs! Take away the protein and you take away the incentive. We ordered chips and salsa but never got the salsa. When my daughter went back up to ask for the pico they gave her a hard time saying they charge for it. She explained that we bought a side of chips and salsa and the girl got frustrated and gave it to her with an attitude. The green salsa we asked for was for the rice bowl. We wanted to put it on ourselves. So I guess you get attitude when you ask for the pico you paid for. It would be nice if the girl at the register understood English better and wasn't so rude, she's also new there. Not only that, when it's 25 bucks for only 2 people to eat, you would think it wouldn't be a problem to get your pico with your chips. Or for the people to be cordial. Screw this place, Zaba's the chincy, charge for huge portions, serve small portions with an attitude. They can take their new manager  and their new worker and ........... Keep your food I'll eat next door. At least they give a nice portion and hold the attitude and speak English and aren't overpriced for tiny portions."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. Surf and turf is a winner. Fish tacos are great, Always fast and always fresh."}
{"text":"Another first time in place as I'm still relatively new to the Area.  Went in mid day, very clean inside,  menu was decent. Basically this is just another Qboda or Chipotle with another name ,same menu choices and pricing.  I did like the decor inside a lot the tables and walls,  food had a good flavor to it. Worth a quick stop better than other fast food choices. Will Repeat."}
{"text":"I have tried everything from the their bowls, burritos, taco and quesadillas.. Never have I been disappointed, great food and consistent service keeps me coming back. Love us some Zabas :)"}
{"text":"This place is basically the same as Chipoltle or Qdoba. All and all decent food but everything was a bit on the salty side. Much better then a Taco Bell but nothing to go out of your way for. Prices are decent and the service is pretty good. There was a problem with the register so they gave us out food for free. Double thumbs up for that"}
{"text":"The tacos here are good, but not great. Service was a bit slow, but friendly. Definitely keep in mind these tacos are twice the size of most street tacos. And when you get the spicy salsa, it's a 7 out of 10 on the spice scale."}
{"text":"Well let's start by saying that their cilantro pesto deserves a star all by itself. That stuff turns anything you put it on into amazing!  Although, I unfortunately had to subtract 2 stars because I felt so rushed by the workers!! I barely had time to think what I really wanted on my burrito. There wasn't anyone behind me in line and only two people in the place. You would think they could be a little more patient with me, especially since it was my first time there and I wanted to customize my meals perfectly. I even asked a couple times about the workers opinions of what she liked best and she laughed and said she didn't know...  It would be nice to have some more feedback from the employees here as well as not feel rushed and like I'm taking up to much of their time for my one order.  On the upside, it's close to the LVAC gym and you can definitely make healthy options here. I like their wide variety of sides and sauces. They even have sweet potatoes! I will be back and hope to see improvements in the future. :)"}
{"text":"I love this Zaba's!!!! I have been coming here ever since it has opened. I visit at least 2 to 3 times a week. Outstanding food!!!! My two favorites are the steak and shrimp burrito and 3 fish tacos!!! I usually alternate between the two at each visit. Do your self a favor. Come and check it out."}
{"text":"Move over Chipotle, Zaba is in town!! Went there for the first time tonight and ordered a little bit of everything on the menu (steak burrito, shrimp quesadilla, street tacos, ceviche and street corn) OFF-THE-HOOK. Super fresh ingredients and lots of mixes. Will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! The ingredients are always fresh and I love it when compared to other places that are similar. I have had their fish tacos, brownies, and burrito bowl. Their rice was light and not dense like some tend to be, the chicken was juicy and perfect amount of seasoning, & their corn is sweet and fresh. When I had their fish tacos the breading was light and they put plenty of toppings on the taco, I like the bowls better though. The brownies here are fresh but they were not as fudgy as I like but still good. They are always very friendly there too. Will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"Smells like sewage every time we walk in. Food is ok."}
{"text":"Good food, huge portions and great prices. The burrito is a bit too large to consume without a fork and knife."}
{"text":"This is my second time that I came here. The first time my son dad lets go try it and I did no comment, now after a few months I did and it's today 9/22/15 with my wife. I think the food is good and it is. Sometimes it. It the taste of food that counts it is the atmosphere of the place. I will recommend the zaba's to any of my friend and family to try it.  I gave four star because of the napkin. Recommend try to get as much you can. Napkin. Lol"}
{"text":"After waiting in line 26 minutes with only 8 people ahead of us the manager announces that now they can only accept cash so everyone is walking out. One of the worst fast-food operations and staffs we have experienced in a very long time. This is Saturday at 1:27"}
{"text":"This will be my last time eating here and we are Sunday regulars. Now that football is on we do take out. We have never had a problem getting kids meals to go for their Sunday promotion. Today however I was informed after they were made and bagged that we would have to pay for them now because I did not take my children with me? We have literally eaten here 30 times and have never heard of this before. Good bye zabas hello cafe rio."}
{"text":"Started out horrible, but in the end it wasn't horrible. The shrimp quesadilla was very greasy but damn the shrimp was good in it. If you want one, you have to wait 10 mins for them to cook the shrimp.   Pros - great location and even better service. So many options and choices.   Cons - cannot call ahead and place order. Greasy quesadilla   I will try them again and adjust my review accordingly."}
{"text":"While the food is yummy (fish tacos and queso are favorites), the customer service was strongly lacking.  So much so, I will likely not return."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, Karla the cashier couldn't care less about my order or ask me for large or small queso & continued to move on with the order behind me as I was asking for something else, very disappointed not the zabas I know"}
{"text":"All the food looked fresh and vibrant, but tasted completely bland. I had a steak burrito with rice, beans, pico, green sauce, and sour cream. The salt shaker saved my lunch, but it was weird having to salt my burrito after every few bites."}
{"text":"Tried this place again, thinking maybe my first take was off. There is a great deal of competiton in this fresh mex segment. These guys just cannot compete. The food was okay, the service was alright, the atmosphere was acceptable and the pricing was in range. They need to do at least one thing great, but they cannot. Now, I go in there on a Saturday at dinner time and I am the only one there for 20 minutes? There   is a better alternative a block north."}
{"text":"These fish tacos give me life!!!!  Be sure to squeeze you lime on them to give it that extra umfffff!!!  Love it!!"}
{"text":"This is my spot...MG hipped me 2 this joint...IT is on point...I don't even know wut Chipotle is cuz I neva been there & always go to ZABA's...4 real...It has healthy choice options compared 2 ur regular menu...I used 2 get the burrito with the wheat tortilla & brown rice, but I had a taste 4 their FAMOUS FISH TACOS and that has been my sh!t since...No lie...If u haven't had it, it is definitely worth the try...WORD!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a really poor experience, mostly due to the service. The staff was very sluggish and flat out rude. They walked around like they had lead shoes and would be making the food half ass in front of you. They got my order wrong and didn't give us half our order. My hubs steak burrito tasted like bland fish (for some reason). I got the fish and shrimp tacos which were actually quite good. The only reason I am giving them two stars is because their tacos were their saving grace. The burrito was terrible and the beans were extremely bland. The real corker for me was the absolute terrible staff. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Another great opportunity to check out a place I've been meaning to try, thanks to Groupon.   The queso sauce was super yum yum. I got the nachos with the shredded beef. I found everything to be pretty good, but the queso sauce outshone everything else on my plate. My fella got the steak burrito with brown rice and pinto beans.   I love that they have the option of whole wheat tortilla and brown rice. That's the great thing about this place. Healthy and non-healthy options unite.   I'll definitely be back! More queso please."}
{"text":"Zaba's is a decent food option in Downtown Summerlin, which is a bit of a letdown usually in the food department.   The restaurant was busy when we arrived around lunch time but the line moved swiftly. The price was a little higher than I like for fast food with all the add-ons and uncharges that come along with extra this or that.   My burrito bowl was tasty, fresh and filling for what it is."}
{"text":"Food was bland and expensive. I ordered a tortilla soup and got a veggie soup. Worse food I've had in Vegas. Never again."}
{"text":"Huge fan of zabas but this location was terrible.  The 2 Servers seemed very short with me and another female customer. But sweet and flirty with the male customers.  On top that they were having a conversation in Spanish to each other while serving customers.  It was very annoying.  I would ask something and would be totally ignored.  Food was good as usual but service was a big thumbs down."}
{"text":"My husband and I are staying at Plaza Hotel for 2 days and figured we'd try Zaba's for breakfast. 5.99 seemed a pretty reasonable price for a breakfast burrito, however the grumpy girl behind the glass partition assembling our burritos informed us, after she'd started our food, that meat was an additional $1.99. In addition to the extra charge for meat, she insisted we could not have pico AND sauce in our burritos without incurring another extra charge. I didn't even ask about adding corn or onions to my order because I'm not a millionaire, folks! Price aside, the burrito girl should really have worn a hairnet because I found a hair in one of my last bites. I wonder if there was an extra charge for it?  I'd suggest the Subway next door for a cheaper, hassle free, quick breakfast if you're a fan of fixings and accoutrements."}
