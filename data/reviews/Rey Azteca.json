{"text":"Very good food, just like Texas. Wonderful staff, good value for your money too. This is a gem that is worth the trip if you like authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in NK/LB...which doesn't say much as they're pretty much the only one too.  Truly though, great food, good service and a nice room.  They have upgraded the dining room (new menus, new furniture, TVs, added a bar etc) in the past couple years.  The staff is friendly and quick.  If you come with a large group it may take a little longer, especially on a busy lunch hour.  They have a large menu and the portions and prices are in line with the value you typically find here in the AK Valley.  It wouldn't compare too favorably to San Diego Mexican, but for PA Mexican it's the bomb!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican we have had in Monroeville hands down! Came from an area that had lots of little place, so we know good Mexican and this is it.  Only negative is salsa was for wusses!   Service was fast and attentive.  Very clean inside also."}
{"text":"I'm from Tampa, Fl , we came to PA to visit family, I'm also Hispanic , and I can tell you that , I've been to this place 2 time in 1 week, and I order Spanish which the first time the waitress was shocked, ( I guess I don't look Hispanic, until I speak because of my accent ) but anyways, the food was good, service was quick, no complains . Fresh lettuce, and tomatoes cut, good tasting avocado dip also ! . The place is small, but I'll tell you I've been in some bigger places in this are of of PA and they suck way more than this place :)"}
{"text":"I'm very picky about Mexican food so I was hesitant to try this place.  Simply stated, their food is phenomenal.  If you are looking for authentic Mexican food in the Pittsburgh area I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great menu and reasonable prices. Staff is very friendly and your ice tea glass never makes it to the half full level. Support local establishments! Eat and shop in the Lower Burrell- New Kensington area."}
{"text":"The chicken flautas here are great!  I love the cheese, the chips, the salsa, and I especially love the cheesecake chimichangas.  So good."}
{"text":"Great food, great kids working there. You'll enjoy it...trust me. I've been coming here for several years and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is always great, however the service always leaves a lot to be desired! We have gone 3 times now and all 3 times service has been excruciating! First time: waited an hour for food, second time: had to get our own silverware and straws after repeatedly asking for them and third time: they only brought 1 burger out of 3 ordered for my CHILDREN. Yeah had to take my 8 year old autistic son across the lot for a fish sandwich AFTER going out for dinner  good food is not worth bad service"}
{"text":"Great food. Service is fine and pretty quick. Wide variety of authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Chips were not very fresh and Agave has better salsa.  Entrees were very good. Service was good. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This might be the best Mexican food in the Pittsburgh area. Totally authentic, and the prices are great, too. I guess I'll be driving up to NK more often."}
{"text":"I had Rey Azteca for dinner this evening, the food was amazing! I had a shrimp chicken and beef fajita it was very reasonably priced as well. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the atmosphere..it was freezing in the restaurant and it was only 35 degrees outside. I ate with my coat on.  The waitress also didn't seem very friendly. She seemed like we were a bother to her. The ore waiters/waitresses seemed upbeat and enjoyable.  Despite that I will definatly return in the future."}
{"text":"Staff is great, good food.  Price is not bad, I never left this place hungry.  Try the number 23 special.  One of the best places in New Kensington area to get your feed bag on."}
{"text":"First time here and it's pretty good. I had the enchiladas poblanas and the mole sauce was pretty spot on. They even have Negra Modelo on tap. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, and lots of it.  Staff is attentive with great attitudes.  If you want good Mex this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This review is only based on one visit -- but this place seems pretty solid.   We'll start with the negatives, which were pretty minor. First the complimentary salsa was pretty bland -- I didn't care much for it but it is definitely family friendly, which I appreciate because I could feed it to my 3 year old. Second boo-hiss, I got one chicken tamale in addition to my meal, it was dried out (both dough and chicken) and already out the corn husk.  It was also covered in sauce, which tasted good but was very thick.  Not really what I wanted or really ordered according to the menu. I feel like they knew it was dried out and were trying to \"save it\". I ate 2 bites and left the rest, something I'm not known for.  Now for the good -- I had the vegetarian stuffed Anaheim peppers and they were really fantastic -- think spicy mashed potatoes in a pepper and covered in the most delicious cheese sauce you can imagine. Literally, something I could eat every day. Husband had the chicken burrito supreme and I tried it. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the burrito sauce was lighter and much more delicate than sauce on the tamale.  He really, really liked the cheese sauce too, which was also on the burrito.   The rice and beans were standard, as was the service.   Really, what pushes this place beyond a 3 is the cheese sauce and the potatoes in the Anaheims -- they were just exceptional and much better than other local Mexican places."}
{"text":"A perfect lunch spot during the work day.  The service is quick and the food is good. Plus, who doesn't love free chips and salsa before their meal?"}
{"text":"Love! Always have a great time! They start out by giving you free chips and salsa which is fresh. Their house Margarita is one of the best I've had (I take it on the rocks with no salt.)  I always try to get the chorizo queso. It's an awesome white cheese dip with chorizo sausage in it. The mix of spicy sausage in the cheese with a salty chip is amazing! My husband is a huge fan of the shrimp fajitas. He gets them everytime! The shrimp is always perfectly cooked and the toppings are fresh! I enjoy the quesadilla. Either beef or chicken it doesn't matter both are delicious.  The beef is not ground beef it's almost like a beef roast. Very tender and juicy with an awesome flavor. I've had many different items I  their menu and to be perfectly honest, I have yet to be disappointed.  If there is ever an issue with the food, tell them. They are all very nice and have no problem fixing a mistake. All the of staff work well together and stay very busy! We are regulars here and looks like we will be for a long time! Sum up- authentic Mexican dishes that always please and a wonderful staff who take pride in their jobs!"}
{"text":"Very good! My husband and I were looking for something more substantial than fast food while staying in Pittsburgh, PA. And boy did we find it! Both of our meals were delicious. I had the combination dinner with beef taco and beef enchiladas, he had a vegetarian combo with cheese quesadilla and bean burrito. We shared a lime margarita on the rocks that was good, but a bit too sweet for me. He ended up finishing it. The chips and salsa was very good. We got a cheese cake chimichanga for dessert and it was the perfect ending to our meal. Our waitress was very nice and courteous. We will be back if we ever get back to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"My husband is the Mexicn foodie, I get suckered in, and normally hate it.. BUT  love this place. The service is quick and courteous, and the Mexico Special is deicious! I think there is magic in the cheese sauce."}
{"text":"A little hidden place in Monroeville that serves great Mexican food. We've been two times, and both times left satisfied...maybe a little too satisfied.  Portions are generous. Ask for the green tomatillo sauce to accompany your salsa and chips, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"No, No, No, do not do it!  We saw the 4.5 star review and made a point to go, even going a little out of our way on the way back from something after work.  We arrived there at 8PM, and it looked like they were already putting the chairs up.  Really, 8PM is late to arrive?  We went for it anyway.  Next we noticed that they have two house margaritas, the regular sized for like $6, and a double-sized for just $2 more. Having had a hard day we order the jumbo (save the waiter and extra trip as well).  Here's what you get for your extra $2: twice as much generic margarita mix,  sickly sweet, and no extra tequila. Bad.  We were not off to a good start.  The food was equally unremarkable.  Flavorless beans, the standard iceberg lettuce salad (OK the guac is decent, but it should be, right?), and a  veggie burrito where the vegetables were practically raw and hardly seasoned.  I ordered the Mole Poblano because I love Mole and it was supposed to be sweet and spicy.  It was neither.  The Veggie burritos weren't finished, no box please, and (and this never happens) the margaritas were also not finished.   You'll notice that others have mentioned how ridiculously many items are on the menu.  That's usually a bad sign, and in this case it sure turned out to be."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre... guac was good. Service was awful... wouldn't make it a point to come back.."}
{"text":"My husband got the shrimp dish with queso, which was good and tasty.  My shrimp quesadilla was quite salty.  I initially thought it was OK, but the salt-lick effect kept building in my mouth.  Because I was so hungry, and I couldn't finish my meal, I decided to eat some of my husband's dish.  I also took a much-needed Zantac.  When the waitress checked on us, I told her my food was too salty and that I could not eat it anymore.  She said that sometimes the cooks change shifts and some like to use a lot of salt.  I asked if there was a way to discount my meal, since I could not finish it and since I was eating some of my husband's dish.  She said she would check with her manager.  Moments later, she returned and said the manager said I should have complained sooner and that there would be no discount.  I thought this response was lame.  She asked if that was OK and I said nope.  I didn't feel like complaining beyond this effort since I was pretty tired.  I would not return to this place.  They don't seem to care about whether or not the customer is getting a good meal and whether or not they will come back."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Pittsburgh for the price! It reminds me of being back in Texas :-) fantastic food and service. Pleasant people. Great prices."}
{"text":"Been here over 10 times in the past year. My go-to for quality Mexican food at a great price with very friendly staff. Favorite dishes: Enchilada supreme and Vegetarian mushroom enchilada. Food comes out quickly and they serve the best rice I've had! Guacamole is also very fresh."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time. The food is always good with good portion sizes.  Prices are reasonable. A lot of people say the staff isn't friendly enough. To me they do what they are supposed to do. They get your order right and are attentive to your table. The perception that they aren't friendly is probably because English isn't their first language. I'm not a fan of the fajitas, they are just ok to me. All of the burritos are really good. The cheesecake chimichanga is out of this world. Like I said I go here all the time because its good."}
{"text":"Yummy. Had the carne asada tacos with a nice warm (spicy but not overwhelming) tomatillo sauce."}
{"text":"I thought I was in for your average Mexican experience where the food is bland and needs basic seasonings to bring out the flavors.. WRONG! This place blew my mind and may have been the best Mexican I've had anywhere! I'm a certified chef from the Maine coast and I have to tell you go here! It's inexpensive the beers were only $2 and the delicious portions were plentiful.. Will I be back? Every time I come to the Burgh! Way to knock it out of the park guys! Great job!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican and great service! The guacamole is creamy and delicious, and their salsa and chips (free - dropped off at our table within seconds of us being seated ) are spot on. The mole ranchero sauce has a great spice to it, and the pork dishes are great (Slow cooked, fall apart awesome pork). We want to try the desserts next time but we are always full after the big-portioned entrees!"}
{"text":"I agree that this is the best straight up Mexican / tex-mex place on the east end.   The staff are always friendly, and the service is so fast, it's actually funny.  Seriously, go order, and start a stopwatch.  Your food will be there so fast.  You'll giggle.  Anyway, the guacamole is always fresh, the tortillas are hand-made on site, and the beef and chicken dishes are great.  They have several vegetarian options.  I've never tried any of the fish items, because the chicken flautas are deep fried ecstasy.  In retrospect, I never want to see calorie counts for this place.  They are good with kids, and will usually give little ones a sealed container for water (smart people).  While they don't seem to have the high lard content one will find in South Texas, I'm not sure that's a bad thing for those of us over 18 years of age.  (Oh, I miss you metabolism).  The only caution I would extend is they seem to add jalapanos to their refried beans, which can be an issue for the northern palate.  Those of you who love hot food will find this note amusing, but those of us who are total heat-wimps should be warned."}
{"text":"Now acopulco next to dollar tree. Great food. Service is excellent. Eat there at least once a week."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place for good, fast and authentic Mexican food. I've eaten here many times and haven't been disappointed. Very large portion sizes for the price. I think I've had a bit of everything from here.  My favorite is the Pork Rancheros. Very tasty mole sauce. Also has a selection of bottled Mexican pops to try."}
{"text":"This is actually a 4.5 star review.  I really love this restaurant.  There are a few things that I think could be improved upon but mostly every time I've eaten here its been great.  We also order take-out for the office from here quite a bit.  The staff is always very nice and the service is good.  When they say spicy on their menu, they really mean it, too.  My favorites are the Fajita Burrito and the Enchillada Verdes (spicy)."}
{"text":"Rey Azteca is a fantastic place to grab some Mexican food. The menu is large and can please just about anyone. They recently acquired a liquor license and now sell beer and other mixed drinks. Their burritos are always hot and very filling. If you're ever near by stop in and try their great lunch menu."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants around! Prices are decent, food is authentic and service is good. Definitely recommend if you're looking for Mexican food that isn't your typical chain food."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and have never had a bad meal here.  The service is good, not overly friendly but not mean or rude.  If I could drink their queso dip, I would! Prices are a but high for the area, but two people can definitely eat their fill for $40."}
{"text":"Food has always been excellent and service speedy and friendly. Dont go here for the atmosphere though, the place is and alwsys has been rundown a little. Think dive with grest food."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch & ordered a lunch special. The melted cheese was really tasty, but the lunch was not especially fresh tasting. 24 hours later, I had diarrhea. Definitely a bacteria problem. If I had to venture a guess: too many items on the menu to keep fresh, so something was sitting in the refrigerator too long. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This has become our go-to place for a quick bite.  Food is consistently good, drinks are extremely reasonably priced, but best of all--waitstaff is super friendly, knows the menu and very attentive!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Of the Mexican restaurants in the area, this ones prob my favorite. Being a vegetarian, this place has the best variety of veg foods on its menu. The foods also great. The sauce on the enchiladas has a unique smoky BBQesque flavor. Their spinach quesadilla is also bomb."}
{"text":"Living within 6 or 7 blocks of this place makes my life so happy!  My husband and I love going here.  The food is NEVER bad and the service is ALWAYS good.  My husband and I love Verde, and I would rate Rey Azteca even higher for the food.  Amazing.    Only thing I would change would be the margaritas.  If the mixes weren't bottled they would be SO much better!  I'm a fan of a fresh margarita, not the Daily's mixes.  That's the ONLY reason to rate 4 instead of 5 stars."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place!  This is our favorite restaurant.  The people are very friendly and the food is wonderful.  My favorite is the Barbara especial. The queso is delicious.   You cannot go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"Every time I come, I never leave disappointed. The food is always very good as is the service. Love the carne asada tacos! Will hopefully be a regular!"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here almost every Thursday night.  We love the food and the people that work here are so friendly"}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night and it was excellent.  It seems like the Irwin/North Huntingdon public has found this diamond in the ruff as well.  We had to wait about 10 minutes for our table at 6pm which wasn't a problem because the place was packed.  I had the pork carnitas, my wife the fajitas, and my father in law the enchiladas supreme.  We all couldn't have been happier!  Service was good, food hot and fresh, and inexpensive.  This will definitely be our go to Mexican restaurant - best around hands down!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant numerous times.  I have never had a bad experience, in fact I'm going tonight to celebrate a birthday with a friend.  I've been there when it was pretty empty and when it was packed without noticing a difference.  The employees are very friendly and accommodating.  The food is spectacular.  Everything I have tried reminds me of my own visit to Mexico.  I highly recommend this restaurant to all of my friends and family.  If you want authentic Mexican go here!  You'll love it!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican Resturant for lunch. The Speedy Gondolas comes out really fast & it's delicious. Staff is always nice too."}
{"text":"Food was adequate but greasy. Beans and rice lacked any flavor. Chips and salsa were good. Overall, disappointed in this restaurant. Better bet is Reyna Cafe in the Strip."}
{"text":"My husband and I first went to Rey Azteca because it was right around the corner from us in Penn Hills.  I am so glad we tried it that first time because in my opinion it's one of the best authentic Mexican restaurants in the area.  I had been to the Frankstown Rd location numerous times and most recently I dined at the new restaurant.  I was thoroughly pleased with the new restaurant - same menu, same prices & fresh decor.  They have a huge selection of dishes and the portions are great.  I also love the original margarita on the rocks (large size - of course).  The service is attentive, efficient and friendly.  The food is top-notch.  I have never had a bad experience here.  It was sad to see Rey Azteca leave Penn Hills.  However, they definitely made a good decision in relocating to Penn Center East.  All in all, Rey Azteca has a lot going for it, and I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I was dying for a good mexican place two weeks ago, and I'm pretty glad I found this place. For a sunday, it was ominously quiet, including the rest of the locations in the shopping cul-de-sac thing. Staff was good and attentive. Chips and salsa were good (how can't they be?!). The menus are a bit too much. It was a little hard to navigate and pick one thing. Anyhow, the wait was amazingly short. We got our food in ten minutes, at least. I'm an enchilada guy, and they didn't disappoint. My mom's a huge fan of chile relieno, and she said her's was perfect. Prices weren't even bad, either. If you're in the area, check this place out.   P.S. they were working on the bar when we got here two weeks ago, not sure if it's done it not. If you want to OD on margaritas, be sure to check first."}
{"text":"Great fresh food here. Homemade guacamole and salsa. Very reasonable pricing. Great margaritas! It's in the middle of a strip mall but I've never had a bad meal here and go quite often."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had chicken fajitas that were delicious! Extremely pleased with service,  quality, quantity, and price!  Definitely a place to stop for great Mexican food."}
{"text":"They give you allot of good and the price is right. Very good menu items that had me come back twice in one week. This location use to be in penn hills. I'm so glad they are now in monroeville."}
{"text":"I love certain things here. The chicken soft tacos are great. The carnitas are great. The chilies renillos with chicken are great. But...yes, the infamous but. Some of the workers are limited in English. Not that I have a problem with that since I usually order in Spanish. But when I do, I'd like to not have an order for take out be wrong. And trust me, my Spanish is fine..."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! Be careful though, because you might eat too much. Try the verde tomatillo sauce, too. It's excellent on just about everything."}
{"text":"Good, fast and cheap!  Check one out if you are in the mood for a decent Mexican meal."}
{"text":"Walked into the restaurant. My fiancée and I both had long days. We have eaten here previously and it was decent. We were excited to sit at the new bar that they recently built.  As we walk in the door, ALL of the chairs are turned upside down and sitting on the tables, except for the ones that were occupied by a few patrons. It was 8:30pm. The posted restaurant hours, which I didn't realize, say that it closes at 9pm. So a full 30 minutes before closing time. I don't know what kind of place that spends money to put in a FULL BAR closes at 9pm on a Wednesday. I am sure they do a killer lunch game given the proximity to Penn Center. But seriously, having the chairs up on tables 30 minutes before close is a bit much. We couldn't even go to the bar to sit to have one beer, while we decided where the heck else we had to go because this place closes at 9.  I admit I am writing this review in a state of hanger. All I wanted was a cold beer and Mexican food. Probably a burrito."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I was not impressed with the veggie options.  My friend, who eats chicken, seemed to like her food, so unless you are a vegetarian, take this review with a grain of salt.  All the veggie combos are sort of uninspired.  Almost all of them include chalupas, so if they're not your thing, your choices are limited.  I had the two anaheim peppers stuffed with mashed potatoes and cheese.  They were interesting, but not as good as chiles rellenos.  The restaurant is a converted fast-food joint, but manages to have some character.  Service was a little slow.  They have a good drink menu and good happy-hour deals.  Overall - not terrible, but I have experienced better.  If you live in the city, I don't think the vegetarian food was worth the drive."}
{"text":"Loved the burrito texano with shrimp, chicken,  and steak. Not with the little shrimp either. Will be going back here!!"}
{"text":"The cheese sauce is AMAZING! The food portions are quite large and they have a large selection on their menu.   The staff is kind of slow but I like that everyone works together and you don't just have one server/waitress.   Prices aren't bad either."}
{"text":"Closest resemblance I can think you to remind me of their food is simply VOMIT! What can I say I like Mexican but I may be guilty of liking AMER-mexican more. The chips and white Que-so with complimentary chips are pretty good, the fajitas are good as well, however everything else not so much. The burritos aren't very flavorful and are riddled with watered weak seasoned meats that are cooked down so much It just taste like texture. UGH! this place was so promising but I think its I want and plate full of re-fried beans and Queso I can no problem opening the metal can at home MYSELF! I know I'm harsh but truthful. I do not honestly know what the hype is about this place its not that great but to each their own."}
{"text":"Great service beginning at the door! The staff is always friendly and promptly supply each table with warm chips and salsa upon being seated (I'm always starving when I walk in).  I recommend the Enchiladas Rancheros if you're looking for something spicy. They have tasty margaritas too!  My girlfriend and I eat here a few times a month."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant around! We always try something new and we love everything we have tried!!"}
{"text":"I don't have much to say about Rey Azteca. I'll keep it short and sweet, just like my visit there this past weekend!  It is your traditional Mexican restaurant in Monroeville. Upon arrival, we were quickly seated and greeted with salsa and a warm basket of chips. We placed our lunch order and it was served about 10 minutes later. Everything was fresh and hot. Our drinks never went close to empty and neither did our chips and salsa (we  asked for seconds and they didn't charge us!) A lot of patrons around us got dessert (the fried ice cream). It looked so good, but we were so full that we passed on dessert. This is definitely a place you'd want to visit if your hungry, but in a time crunch. The service was great and the food was even better!"}
{"text":"Have been going here regularly since it was originally in a location in Penn Hills years ago. It has consistently been excellent, both in food and service. Love the carne asada tacos in particular."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed at this location. The food is amazing and they get your order correct if you are doing take out. A+"}
{"text":"This location is now closed.  The new location is a few miles away at:  3440 William Penn Hwy Wilkins Township, PA 15235"}
{"text":"Delicious food at a good price. My negro modelo draft came out in a frosted mug. Quick, friendly service."}
{"text":"Amazingly good and delicious food! Great service as well,  we ate a really good shrimp burrito, it was the Cancun shrimp! It was really really really cheap! Please go there and enjoy real Mexican food! Gracias muchachos :)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the old location on Frankstown Road in Penn Hills closed, but I'm glad they moved to nearby Penn Center East in Wilkins Twp. They offer huge portions at cheap prices. Everything is homemade so you'll have to wait a little for your food. You get rice, beans, salsa and chips with every order.    The new location is much nicer than the previous location which was a Burger King before it was turned in Rey Azteca. I wish I could tell you more about the food , but I always get the same thing. The Burrito Texicano. It has steak, chicken and shrimp and is absolutely amazing! Why mess with perfection, right? The margaritas are huge and not to be missed!   They also have a kids menu for the little ones. The service is always quick and with a smile. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Mexican food,  and this is our favorite place.  I've had several dishes here and never been disappointed.  The refried beans are the best and you'll not find a substitute in this area!  Love the margaritas too! The staff is always friendly and seriously the cooks are faster than McDonald's. Fast fresh and delicious!  Can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"If you are in Monroeville and looking for Mexican this is the place to go.  Friendly staff, reasonable prices, and great food.  Warm chips and salsa were served when we sat down.  Picture shows grilled shrimp chimichangas on far plate and on the first plate it was dinner combo #29 shredded beef quesadilla, ground beef taco and ground beef enchilada.    While I was not there for Happy Hour they do offer Happy Hour specials.  I would definitely return if back in this area."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the service is always great. This is my go-to any time I want good quality Mexican food. I have ordered a number of items from the menu and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"We moved out here from California and for 3 years have lamented the lack of good mexican food. Now, with Rey Azteca, our search for quality mexican food is over. This place is seriously the Best Mexican food in the area. So much better than El Campesino or Mexico City. fast service, friendly staff, good prices, awesome food.   first basket of chips and salsa is free. the salsa is fresh and yummy (could be a little hotter for my tastes though). Hubby  was impressed with their vegetarian options. the carne asada tacos are among the best I've ever had, and the tomatillo sauce they come with is to die for!!! if you're really hungry (or want leftovers for lunch for the next day) get the Special Dinner - taco, enchilada, tamale, chalupa, and chile relleno, with rice and beans. all that for $11 bucks - total value!   my complaints are minor - a tad pricey for the sides (come on now, $5 bucks for a side of rice and beans?) and saying \"no substitutions\"  then listing what the acceptable substitutions are.   they have restaurants in johnstown and butler as well. had I known that before this one opened I would have been driving to butler. I cannot say enough good things about Rey Azteca. You must try it. :)"}
{"text":"Brought my family here for dinner. Wasn't very impressed. Service was sub standard and prices were high for what we received. Never had buritios from a restaurant that were that small and open ended eont be going back."}
{"text":"the most authentic Mexican food around! the service is always good and the food is very fast. their margaritas are HUGE and the food portions are also very generous. the endless chips and homemade salsa are also a nice touch"}
{"text":"Corporate Mexican food, nothing to brag about, but for the area, adequate."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and I love it!. The prices are more than reasonable. The flavors of the food are perfect to go along with fast and friendly service, whether you're dining in or taking out. Specials every night as well!"}
{"text":"After getting threatening messages on here about my original review I have moved their rating down to 1 star. Looks poorly when you attack people based on what happened to them. Very sad to see that's the level things are taken too. Versus just asking what happened and offering to discuss it or at least nicely asking but making threats is no way to go."}
{"text":"After shopping, who would turn down a Mexican meal? Not I, said I!  This is a nice little spot that sits in a small strip area.  There is ample parking with easy access in and out of the lot.   The staff here is super friendly and they greeted me and everyone else immediately upon walking in the door. The dining area isn't huge but it was large enough that you didn't feel like you were a part of your neighbors conversation.  The menu, my goodness, is massive. I almost got a headache after trying to figure out what I truly wanted to claim for my meal that evening. Options are good so no complaints there. We were served the usual chips and salsa but, quite honestly,  the salsa was the only thing I did not like. It lacked flavor and it was room temperature, not cold, not warm just not a good temperature for salsa,  if that makes any sense. It lacked any real flavor and just tasted like pulsed canned tomatoes to me...meh.  Our meals were very very good. We had a shrimp burrito and shrimp.....and they were amazing. The shrimp, cheese, beans, rice and side of guac were the real deal. Shrimp were cooked perfectly and seasoned well.   This is a great spot to add to our list...can't wait to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Rey Azteca has easily the best Mexican food in the Pittsburgh area. It is my favorite restaurant and is at an amazing price. I have eaten at expensive prestigious eateries, but Rey Azteca beats them all!  For lunch, I always get combo 12-the flautas are to die for! And dinner I usually get combo 17-beef burrito and a chicken enchilada. The quesadillas are so delicately crunchy and salsa is so fresh and smooth...certainly a must try if you're in the area!  The only thing one could possibly dislike is the decor is rather lacking and the walls are a ghastly green and purple. But wouldn't care if I had to eat in the basement, the food is so amazing!  TL;DR So all in all, Rey Azteca is a fantastic restaurant for the best Mexican food in the Pittsburgh area. Not exactly aesthetically on point, but it has delicious food at a great price."}
{"text":"Wow, what a surprise to find an authentic Mexican restaurant just a few miles from home.  Prices right, food great and the Margueritas HUGE.  We enjoyed our evening and highly recommend Rey Azteca."}
{"text":"Conveniently located,Ample parking. As we walked in,were greeted with a smile and immediately seated. Free chips and salsa were nice! Wait staff was very polite and professional. Mini tacos from the appetizer were not that great avoid ordering those. Entrees were awesome and delicious!! Drank jorrito,tasted refreshing but 56gms of sugar!! (it was a cheat day) overall,highly satisfied with the service and food! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This Rey Azteca is as good as most in the West Central Pa area. Quality Mexican food at a decent price. Everything we had was fresh, and delicious. One star loss due to lack of service. Primarily empty restaurant but left siting for about 10 minutes before our order was taken, and just an overall lack of service. Decent food though as normally found at Rey Azteca."}
{"text":"Very good food!  generous portions and served quickly, but not simply rewarmed premade food.  free chips and salsa were excellent, and not too spicy, especially since I can't eat really spicy food.  I recommend the burrito Cancun for seafood lovers.  Price was very affordable."}
{"text":"My husband and I went this evening....LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Everything was incredibly AWESOME !!!!! The place is visually calming and soothing......nice easy lighting, colorful artwork and decor.....the booths are big, tall, comfortable and private and the place is arranged perfect.....the servers are GREAT ! Very polite, friendly....just PERFECT.  All our food was SUPERIOR.....just perfect. Warm tortilla chips and salsa, Nacho Supreme was soooooooo good.....the Beef Burrito, Beef Enchilada, Beef Taco was delicious......perfect!.....The Fried Chicken Chimichanga was awesome, EVERYTHING we got was soooooooo good.....we really enjoyed our dinners.....BTW, my Husband IS Latino and we lived in Texas a while with his family....and I never had Mexican food THIS good ! It was just really great. This was our first time visiting and I can't wait to go try some more stuff.....and HOPEFULLY save room for Fried Icecream !!!!!! Go try this place, it's such a nice, friendly, calm atmosphere.....romantic, private....so nice.....we just loved it."}
{"text":"Friendly attentive service... salsa is runny but tasty, chips are good... ceviche appetizer was very good. Fajitas Texarna  for 2 was was good sized but could do with chorizo to give it some more spice and variety. No hot sauce on the tables?"}
{"text":"This is a small chain of 3 restaurants.  This location is nothing fancy on the exterior, but there is some over the top heroic Aztec themed art inside.   The service is efficient, and they do a good business. The portions are good an everything tastes authentic, although a little bland.   We ordered draft beers and they were huge.  My vegetarian special was just $8 (one dollar off the menu price. This is a we'll run establish with a loyal following, i don't think you can go wrong here."}
{"text":"The food is always so very good here. We will never stop coming just because of the food, however, I have to say that our waitress this past time was forgetful. I ordered a glass of wine and it did not come until almost the end of our meal. I think there were some minor communication problems, however once things were straightened out, we enjoyed a very very delicious meal as usual. We were also seated right next to the door, which I did not like at first but I let this go because I didn't feel like making a fuss. I did get a draft the whole time we were eating, which was unpleasant.  I know that sounds petty, but to me where you sit has a lot to do with the atmosphere while at the restaurant.   I ordered a cheese quesadilla which, had so much filling in it I didn't know what to do with myself. It was so delicious and steamy hot and the cheese just melted everything together. Usually quesadillas are thin, but this was more like a sandwich in thickness, and tasted so good I could go for one right now. My husband got a burrito with steak, chicken, and shrimp inside. He did not have any complaints and it was finished in no time.   One thing I wanted to mention was that the guacamole was such a small serving and we paid over four dollars for a side of this. I know avocados are expensive, but geez for that amount of guac and knowing the price k paid for the little tiny bowl (see photos), I could have picked them myself!   The complementary chips and dip are always a hit.  We had churro's for desert which, despite as being so incredibly full, we always make room for them and they hit the spot for sure. Other than a few small housekeeping things, we have few complaints."}
{"text":"True authentic Mexican. Everything is fresh and the staff is pleasant and attentive. Prices are reasonable, and the margaritas strong. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"After having an interesting time at the car dealership we found ourselves in need of food and drink. I checked yelp and found this place. Walking in we were greater by a friendly hosted who showed us to a booth. Not 5 sec later we were brought out chips and salsa. The chips were fresh and the salsa had good spice and a smooth consistency.  The menu is large with lots of different combinations.   To drink I ordered a large margarita and Bry had a negra modelo on draft. The margarita had great flavor. For dinner I choice chicken and cheese flautas. They were delicious. The chicken was moist and well seasoned and the guacamole it came with was also very good. The other half had a fajita dish with beef chicken and shrimp which is his staple and he enjoyed it. The little boy had a quesadilla and French fries. He ate almost all of it. Once it cooled down enough for him to eat it.   This was a great place for a meal. The staff is friendly and very attentive. The food is hot, fresh and comes out fast. Not much more I could ask for at a place like this."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and so was the margarita  Already planning my step back and I haven't left yet"}
{"text":"The food at this location is fantastic and it's close to the penn center buildings. They were able to accommodate a group of 9 with no problems and the food was delivered fast, and hot .   I personally had the spinach and mushroom burritos with rice, and it was super great!! I was super impressed with the taste, quality, and presentation.  I will be returning again if I am ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Yikes.  Not sure how this place warrants such magnanimous language in some other reviews.  Me, I thought it sucked.  Salsa was a weak, bland tomato sauce perfect for the local palate.  We tried the fish tacos.  Places like Bakersfield in the city charge $4 for a decent fish taco.  Those come with an awesome spread and squirt bottle salsas.  These were $12.75 for 3 and were literally tilapia on a soft tortilla.  No frills for my coin.  Mexican food in this city is such shit.  People can validate by claiming to have lived in such a mexican food mecca before and how this place is the Greatest of Them All but people are generally idiots."}
{"text":"Okay, had to try this place. Heard it was good from some friends who had dined there when it was in Penn Hills. They are now in the Penn Center East Complex. I think they have four other locations widely dispersed outside of the Pittsburgh City Limits. Three of us went on a Friday and all were pleased with our meal. I would say the atmosphere is a little plain, nothing fancy, but not bad, pleasant enough. We were seated at a booth for four, but there are smaller booths, larger for 6 booths and some tables. We were greeted at the door immediately and swiftly taken to a booth in the center of the restaurant. A server brought us salsa and chips immediately. The chips were warm and crispy and the salsa was a good medium spicy style with good body.  We had a little bit of a hard time explaining we wanted a pitcher of Margaritas so he got the 'manager' I guess and we discussed the margarita situation. The had plenty of various flavors but only sold the 'lime' flavor by the pitcher, so that was or order on the rocks. I would say certainly not near the best but the mix was okay with a very lime taste and not much complexity. Food-wise they have a pretty good size menu with Chicken, Pork, Shrimp and Beef sections. Also Burritos, Fajitas, House Specials, Vegetarian specials, Combination Platters, Al La Cart, a Children's menu, Salads and some deserts; plus a good sized Lunch Menu. Very complete with so many choices for your tastes. For the unfamiliar they have a section with descriptions of about 20 Mexican dishes.  For example Taquito - Fried Corn tortilla rolled Chicken or Beef.  We ordered 3 dinners: Shrimp, Pork and Chicken dinners. For Shrimp we ordered the Camarones Al Mojo de Ajo, which is grilled shrimp with Mexican Garlic Sauce and lettuce, guacamole cheese, Rice and Flour Tortillas on the side. The shrimp in this dish were plentiful and cooked to perfection they were good size not tiny and very delicious. Would certainly order again. Almost every place of this nature overcooks shrimp so this was so nice to see the proper cooking attention.  For our Pork meal we ordered the Pork Carnitas. This was a very ample portion of fried pork with Tomatillo Sauce, Rice, Beans and flour tortillas. The pork was very tender, juicy and well seasoned. A real hit. Order again.... heck yes.   On the Chicken side we ordered from the Especialidades (specialty) menu and got the Enchiladas Verdes which is three shredded chicken enchiladas with Green Tomatillo Sauce, lettuce, sour cream tomato and a piece of steak on the side. Steak on the side was a pretty unusual accompaniment for me. The chicken was highly flavored inside tender wrappers topped with the aforementioned adornments. Now the green sauce is not my favorite, but the flavor and tenderness of the chicken made it a real winner.  I can't attest for authentic, but my one of our companions who has been to Mexico several times says this food matches up pretty well. So on his word and my taste buds I would recommend a trip here. We will certainly be back to try more of their very good food."}
{"text":"I stopped in a few months ago with co workers and was pleasantly  surprised how authentic the meal was. I had the number 3 combo and was blown away! This is a get place in Monroeville for Mexican food. I highly recommend it here and it is a favorite amongst my family."}
{"text":"I can spare two stars because my 5-year-old liked his food, the salsa was good, and service was fast... but other than that... awful.  We went on a Friday at dinner time and there was no wait at all.  My husband & I each ordered a different vegetarian selection and found both to be a notch below mediocre. The potatoes tasted like they came from a box, (though I didn't ask) the sauce on my enchiladas was overcooked, sticky, and a little burnt-tasting, and the beans reminded me of the ones they have at Taco Bell. The margarita was overly sweet and sort of tasted like Kool-Aid. Our server was rude (she tossed our guacamole onto the table as she walked past from enough distance that it actually slid to the other side of the table) and unpleasant.   Judging from many positive reviews and friend's recommendations, we must have gotten them on a bad day, and will likely give this place another shot and will update the review at that time."}
{"text":"Just about the best Mexican food you can find in Pittsburgh. A very diverse and extensive menu that never fails to deliver."}
{"text":"A great place to have dinner.  The whole experience of going here is really good.  The food is amazing and the staff is genuinely friendly.  The food comes out really quickly and is very reasonably priced.  It is really nice to have a restaurant like this in Irwin.  Out of all the places that are really just the same standard American suburban food choices (aka plain and mediocre) this place really stands out.  I go here almost every time I visit my parents at home and an never disappointed."}
{"text":"Me & my wife love mexican food, so we figured we would try Monroeville's newest Mexican delight. Though I am a strict El Campesena guy when it comes to Mexican in the area, I am starting to veer towards Rey's. I mean this is crazy for a kid that LOVES El Camp, especially after only ONE visit to Rey's.   I don't if it's my selfishness, that I don't like new places or environments, but the new El Camp is missing something that it had at the old Pappin's. So after only one visit I am willing to brake my loyalty to El Camp and give Rey's a run.  My recommendations at this joint are very rough & limited. But the sauce on there Enchiladas is fantastic. Don't know if that's what there calling there mole, but it's rich in smokeyness. This must mean there is Adobo sauce involved which is NEVER a bad thing. The right amount of heat so no hot sauce is needed (well, for me).  The chips and salsa aren't even close to the quality of El Camp. Though I do like a thicker chip, these were just bland. The salsa is very jar tasting to this jedi.  My meal made up for more than what they offered in chip & salsa department. So I have to give it Rey's for stepping into the ring with other Mexican restaurants in the area.  Jedi Recommendations;  * Enchilada * Burrito  * Taco (WAY better than El Camp)"}
{"text":"I had the  Camarones a la Diabla which was excellent. It was a spicy red sauce over the shrimp that wasn't insanely hot. I was expecting the typical 6-8 pieces of shrimp but to my surprise they gave me 10-14 pieces on top of the rice. This was the first time eating at the restaurant and will be back in the future."}
{"text":"Can't say that I've sampled the menu extensively, but I grab food there frequently since I work close by.  What I get is always delicious and the staff is very friendly!  I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"For starters, I'm from out of town. We decided on tex-mex.  The previous place we went to, was not impressive. So we came here. Oh my gawds! We should've returned to the previous place.  No endless chips and salsa!! WTH? How am I supposed to eat my dinner with no chips??  The menu is huge! Nice variety and the prices are reasonable. The presentation is nice on small plates. :(  The food is BLAND. We had to add an entire lime to the guacamole to even make it edible. It also had too many onions and very little cilantro. Then we had to ask for hot sauces. I don't have to tell you how much of that we needed to use.  So, in the end, I do not recommend eating here.  There's other places in town.  When we come back to see our friends, we will not come back here for anything!"}
{"text":"Nothing special, but green verde salsa is wonderful. Food is presented well.   Red salsa tastes like canned tomatosno flavor or heat.  The bright lights above our table were annoying.  They use artificial sweet sour syrup in margaritas and no fresh lime juice so we didn't order one.  Pittsburgh makes awful margaritas, bastardized  Rice isn't worth eating, beans needed salt.  We won't return  Emiliano's is much much better"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! The prices are reasonable and service is quick.  I typically get a combo with a chicken enchilada, chalupa, chicken taco, and a cheese quesadilla for like 8 bucks.  Their salsa is super mild, great guacamole, and beef nachos.  You definitely leave full!  A great asset for the area."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is frequently lacking. There are 2 slim, younger guys that work their ass off and we love it when they wait on us. The Dos Equis beer tap is frequently on the fritz, but when it works they have the best frosted mug giant beers around. Reasonable prices and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been an Aldi lover since the 80's when I lived in Germany. I was elated when they opened stores in the States. I trust their brands and labels. And I love the finds of lower priced household goods they find. Uncomplicated, easy to find what you need quickly, and you're on your way. Their pizzas are quite good and their prices cannot be beat, anywhere."}
{"text":"Worst Margarita ever. Could not taste Tequila,when I questioned the server, he did not understand, so I returned drink and had water. they charge you for 2 dollar for additional chips. The food was okay,but friendliness of staff lacking. Will not be back"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Rey Azteca was in November in Monroeville with my coworker and I loved it!  After a long day of shopping, that same coworker and I went to this one. I'm pretty sure the menu is exactly same as the other.  To begin  with, the interior of the restaurant is gorgeous and I love the artwork they have going on (especially on the tables). The Spanish music in the background also is great and creates a nice authentic vibe. The chips and salsa are brought out right away and they're nothing special, but still good.  I ordered the tacos de carne azada (anything with carne asada is my fave Mexican dish). The meal did not disappoint. They come with grilled onions on them and then cilantro, lime, and tomatillo on the side (the last has a bit of a kick). You also get a plate full of refried pinto beans! It's more than filling and tasty with a reasonable price.  Being from California and having only lived in Pennsylvania for three years, Rey Azteca is definitely one of the better Mexican restaurants I've come across."}
{"text":"My husband had been raving about this place, so awhile back he finally took me to the old location in Penn Hills off Rodi Rd and Frankstown.  I think I was less than impressed as the location looked like an old Denny's, Rax or something.  The food was good, however so when they moved to the Shopped at Penn Center, we decided to make a trip from the Southside over east a bit.   The new space is great, much cleaner and nicer.  Speedy service, cheap prices and yummy food makes it all even better,  We live near Emiliano's in the Southside so we have a lot of Mexican options near us, however, in Pittsburgh, if I want Mexican, at this point, Rey Azteca is my favorite place to go."}
{"text":"First time here. Service was great, very attentive to the whole group. We got our meals quickly and everything was delicious"}
{"text":"Since when did Mexican food get so expensive ? We arrived at 2pm and the place was completely empty. Mediocre food and lack luster service. I had been going to this place when they were up at the top of Rodi Road in Penn Hills about 3 years ago and their lunches were delicious and only $4.50  Since the move the menu has changed twice and gone up to $7 and $8 for the same amount of food which is almost double. I bit down on my taco and got a big sharp chicken bone that almost punctured my mouth. After that the whole experience was a turn off. All 3 of us in our party said we will not go back."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Rey Azteca since they were in their Frankstown Road location and I have never had a bad meal here. The food has always been very good and very, VERY cheap. I've been amazed at the dollar to food ratio ever since I found this place. If you're looking for great food at a cheap price, this is it."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. Out of all the Mexican restaurants in Monroeville, Rey Azteca is the best. They have real homemade refried beans and good salsa. The staff is friendly as well."}
{"text":"I'm a Mexican food snob, after growing up with authentic Mexican food by friends and family in Southern California... And I have to say, this little gem was the BEST Mexican food since I moved to Pennsylvania in 1994!  I thought I had found the best at Emiliano's on the south side in Pittsburgh, but Rey Azteca in Irwin takes the cake!  Everything served to me today was very flavorful and seasoned perfectly. The starter salsa was smooth and delicious, warm chips. I tried the fajita burrito lunch special on a whim, best $7 on Mexican food I ever spent. Their menu also offers a variety of classic Mexican desserts and awesomeness. Can't wait to come back and try some full dinners and other combos. Did I mention the service was super fast and the employees super friendly and inviting. I will give you my money Rey Azteca!!! :)"}
{"text":"This is my second time at a Ray Azteca and I love the food! The wait staff here is friendly and the one waiter came out with I kid you not 6 plates stacked on one arm he had an arm sleeve like oven mitt on, was interesting to watch! We got the Texanas? Dinner for two and it was delicious! Love the combo of the shrimp, chicken, and steak! The shrimp is my favorite! Grilled just right. Trust me you don't leave her hungry :) will be coming back to this location again"}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic Mexican food. Not American food with a Mexican flair as I've heard other establishments claim. The lunch menu is extensive quick and inexpensive. Dinner is varied, and delish. Not the made up Spanish sounding names that the big chains give to pseudo Mexican food, but real stuff. This would not be exceptional in California or Texas, but for the Pittsburgh area it is mind blowing."}
{"text":"I don't eat Mexican often but this is a good choice. Large menu that is sure to please everyone."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. Service is always polite and fast, and the food is far better than El Camp and Patron combined. Wide tequila and Mexican beer selection since the bar is open. Avoid the shrimp. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A number of these in the region. Good Mexican food that you can't get anywhere else locally.  Recommend the Molé.  Caution, drinks are very strong...in a great way."}
{"text":"Our server was excellent and very friendly. The restaurant itself was nice and clean. Unfortunately, the food was terrible. I got a few soft tacos with different meats, they were all very bland and were soaked and dripping with so much grease that I lost my appetite and didn't finish my food. The service was great, but because of the food I will not be back."}
{"text":"Foood is really good and quick.  Hardly ever a wait. My biggest problem is that you are often left standing at the door while they wipe tables making you wait until they are ready to come so.  Service has really fallen terribly.   Ver\"unfriendly waitresss.  It is like you are bothering them.  If the food wasnt good and quick, i would pass on eating here."}
{"text":"Was in town for a hockey tournament, restaurant close to hotel.  Good food and service.  Nice vegetarian choices.  Would go back again if in town."}
{"text":"Wow.  This place was quite the surprise for me.  I wasn't expecting much from this place, as the lighting is a bit too bright and this place always seems empty.    Service was super friendly.  The waiter recommended the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde.  I took his advice.  They were super spicy and quite delicious.  Can't believe this place is in Irwin!  Definitely a must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great reasonably priced Mexican food.  Definitely try the Enchiladas Verdes if you're into spicy.  You won't be disappointed!!!    Service here is great as well."}
{"text":"I'm going to just assume that the reason this place has a high rating is because this town has never had Mexican food to compare it to. I didn't taste love in any thing I tried. Very sad.  The taco shells: were store bought Taco Bell quality stale.  The salsa: had no flavor. I was adding pepper so I wasn't just dipping my chip into tomato water. The chicken: tasted like it was from a can of chicken of the sea. The beef: was mush.  The beans: had the flavor of l what I imagine the color brown tasting like. I also ordered my favorite - chili relleno. It wasn't even stuffed or covered in batter and sauce. Just a sad little chili with some chicken plopped on top. PLEASE Google chili relleno before you serve it on your menu.  I'm sorry Pittsburgh, you've been duped.  Head over to Taco Bell across the street, you'll get more flavor from those packets."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place. My husband and I eat here quite often. The staff is ALWAYS extremely friendly, efficient, and fast! The food is always delicious, hot, and comes out quickly. Literally, I have waited less time at Rey Azteca than I have at the drive-thru at a fast food restaurant. Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Rey Azteca gets zero points for ambiance and location, but I don't mind eating my chips and salsa at a random place in a strip mall. We were quite pleased with our meal here. The menu offers pretty typical Mexican fare that you'd expect to find at a place like this (you know, Combinations # 1 through 579 that are all some mix of burritos, tostadas, quesadillas, enchiladas, beans, rice, etc.)   Food in this vein can sometimes be bland and all taste the same, but both my husband and I thought the food was very tasty. I got the Vegetarian Combo #10 (bean burrito, cheese enchilada, cheese quesadilla). The beans in the burrito had a lot of flavor and the enchilada sauce was very well-spiced. Decent portion sizes too! My husband had the carne asada, and he reported that his steak was tender and well-seasoned. He enjoyed the rice and beans that came along with his meal as well.   You get a free basket of chips and salsa to start with, although they charge for refills, which kinda bugs me for some reason (not that we really ever get chip refills, but I feel like it's my right as an American to have the *option* of completely stuffing my face full of unlimited complimentary chips should I choose to do so). The salsa was decent, although could definitely have used more cilantro. As for the service, it was fast and friendly. Overall, if you're craving Mexican food, this is a good choice!"}
{"text":"Of all the Tex-Mex type restaurants I've been to in the Pittsburgh area this is in the top three in terms of quality and authenticity of the food. The other two are El Campesino and Emiliano's. The lunch menu is very reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"Yum food ... nice staff the food is everything a hidden gem  come check this place out my yelps !"}
{"text":"When Rey Azteca first opened in Johnstown during my 3-year stint there 8 or so years ago, the restaurant introduced me to some of the best Mexican food I had ever eaten, so my excitement when they opened a location closer to Pittsburgh was through the roof! I had made the sometimes-annoying drive out of the city to their old location in Penn Hills quite a few times, but recently stopped in to their latest location while in Monroeville. What an improvement!  That's not a comment on the food, though. The food was excellent, as usual, but the new restaurant is much larger and cleaner than the old fast food joint they were in before.  My favorite dish is the enchiladas rancheras. It's the one dish that no other Mexican restaurant in the city can come close to matching. Their ranchero sauce is awesome! Other than the enchiladas, Rey Azteca gives you a ton of delicious food for a reasonable price, and the service is fast and pleasant.  It's nice to see that Rey Azteca hasn't lost its touch with the additional locations that they've added over the years, and I can't emphasize enough how happy I am that they have a location closer to Pittsburgh. It's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I was served the worst margarita of my entire life here. It was a huge goblet of red sugar water. No lime flavor, no tequila flavor, nothing. It was basically koolaid. I took one sip and couldn't drink any more. I planned to ask for another drink (I wasn't going to send it back or ask for it to be taken off my bill; it was my mistake for ordering it) but the waitress never came back to check on us. She actually avoided eye contact for the rest of our meal. When I finally flagged her down after we ate (food was decent but nothing special) she never even acknowledged my untouched drink. We won't ever be back, not with so many other Mexican options not far away. It gets two stars only because the food wasn't bad."}
{"text":"My family chose to eat here visiting one of our relatives in Irwin, and we weren't happy with all the chain restaurants along the main road off the freeway. I thought it looked like a nice authentic Mexican place, not a Tex-Mex which is usually very heavy food, and I was right!  The starter chips and salsa were fresh cooked, not too oily, and lightly crunchy. We ordered another basket. The food came extraordinarily quickly, and was very gluten-free, most of the tortillas were made of corn. The food was well-portioned (not a gigantic platter) and well-priced.  We went back again, and plan on going every time we visit!"}
{"text":"Moved to Pittsburgh from the southwest 2 years ago and this is the first Mexican place I've liked at all. I got the enchiladas verdes and was pleasantly surprised at the spice level of the green sauce. My boyfriend got the special dinner sampler so I got to try the guacamole, tamale, and relleno as well. All good, though the relleno style was not at all what I'm used to. I was also a little disappointed that the \"sopapilla\" on the dessert menu was a fried tortilla and not an actual sopapilla, but oh well. It is definitely worth a try - I know I will go back next time I'm in Monroeville!"}
{"text":"Easily the best Mexican in the eastern suburbs of Pittsburgh.  The service is fast, attentive, and efficient. The portions and prices match up perfectly, especially for lunch time.   My favorite dish here has consistently been the camarones mexicanos. It's a huge plate of no less than 10 plump grilled shrimp with their delicious cheese sauce over it, beans, and guac salad for between $6-$7 during lunch time.   I've also haid their tacos, fajitas, carnitas, and salads and every time I have been. This place has so much actual flavor in their food and nothing tastes like it was from a can and reheated.   Can't wait to get back here!"}
{"text":"Went there on a date with my boyfriend. He absolutely loves this place! Food was delicious!!! Growing up with a spanish family it brought me back! I had the burrito Texano and it was so delicious! I also got flan and it was amazing. I really recommend this place the only reason not 5 stars is the staff is a little slow."}
{"text":"Great food great price. Not as flashy as madmex but very nice."}
{"text":"Quick solo dinner tonight when traveling for business. Cinco de Mayo and they were well staffed and the food was very good. I'm not sure I'd call it authentic but it was good. I've had better Mexican before but that was out west. If I'm in Monroeville I will come back.  Had the shredded chicken soft tacos with rice and retried beans. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"First thing I will say is that their menu is extensive but tiring to read.  There are too many combinations listed which specifically say \"no substitutions\".  I'm not into taking more time to peruse the menu than it takes to eat the darned meal so opted for just selecting a la carte -- one beef soft taco, one chicken enchilada, and rice.  Fortunately, ordering a la carte wasn't too expensive -- only coming to just under 12 bucks for the meal, a diet coke, and tip.    The food was ok; about the norm for a good many of the Mexican restaurants.  Service was prompt, friendly, and efficient as expected with chips and salsa brought to the table immediately.  Salsa was ok; not stellar."}
{"text":"After a meeting with a client, we were looking to grab something quick and cheap, and Rey Azteca totally did it. Actually, it exceeded what we thought we were going to get.  First thing I notice when we're seated: their beer is crazy cheap (finally Pittsburgh! ;)! Under $3 for domestic and Mexican imports. Kudos to you, Rey Azteca.   We split a fajita for two, which came with the usual toppings and sides. I was a little bit disappointed to see that the food wasn't really authentic (cheddar cheese and lettuce? Boo.), but the fajitas were delicious as was the chips and salsa.   Service was really good, though we were one of two parties in the restaurant at the time lol. My only complaint was that for majority of our meal the music was way too loud! Someone eventually turned it down, but it cracked us up, honestly.   Only thing they're missing, imo, is a bar. I think that place would do great with a small bar in it, but what do I know? :)"}
{"text":"Checked Yelp while in town and decided to try this place! The waiting area was full of folks waiting for take out. I was quickly seated and ordered a margarita while I looked over the extensive menu! While looking I was served warm chips and salsa, which was very good! I decided on the Burrito Verdes which is two burritos, one shredded beef and on shredded chicken covered in a chile verde sauce! The margarita was very tasty. The burritos were both delicious! The service was good but the place looks pretty beat up. The booth I was seated on had a split open seat and the \"bar\" was covered in black plastic and non-operational! Bottom line is the food was very good, but the atmosphere was not really warm and inviting!"}
{"text":"The place seems unassuming in the middle of a strip mall but suggest you give it a try.  I did not have time to sit and eat lunch so I ordered take out.  Service was pretty fast and they have a full bar so I, of course, had a beer while I waited.  The beer came in a frosty mug and I did see them making Margaritas, which looked pretty darn tasty. I ordered the pulled pork spicy tacos.  They came with chips and home made salsa and of course all the regular fixins.  I never had a pulled pork taco before and it was delicious.  Tender and spicy and just enough sauce.   There is a lunch menu that is served until 2:30pm and the prices are cheap, nothing over $8.50 and they come with home made chips and salsa.  My lunch was filling and hit the spot. I'll have to make this a regular spot when I am craving Mexican."}
{"text":"The food is always good. I usually get the chicken flautas and those portions are nice. The wait staff could be more attentive, we had to go find a waiter multiple times just to refill our drinks. Also, the first chips and salsa are on the house...after that you pay for more. And, they don't bring you a small bottle of salsa like most places, they give you a dipping cup...for $1.00 extra per cup. Also, the cheese dip is $5.00! So not only do they give you small portions of salsa, but they charge you $1.00 each for extra salsa and $1.00 each for extra chips."}
{"text":"Darn good authentic Mex food!  Great menu, nice portions.  But I didn't find the employees very friendly.  I will, however return.  It was that good."}
{"text":"Great carne asada tacos. Only place that remind me of tacos in California. It's not hard to make it but it seem like no one else can. Thank you"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. We arrived around 6:30 on a Saturday, wasn't overly crowded. It took ten minutes for a server to approach us and ask what we wanted, at which point we just asked for a cheese dip and a DRINK MENU. Received one drink menu, and my partner and I ordered one regular margarita and one \"jumbo Rita.\"  There were no flavored margaritas. The waiter didn't speak English well and I didn't understand his distinction between the regular margarita and and \"jumbo Rita.\" When we got our drinks, the jumbo Rita was the same size as a regular margarita, but $3 more. I think the ingredients were \"fresh\" in the jumbo Rita. We NEVER got a cheese dip. It took half an hour to get our entrees. The waiter did not stop by our table once to ask how things were or if we needed anything. We waited ten minutes for a check, which the waiter did not explain that we had to go to the register to pay, so we sat around for another five minutes waiting for someone to pick up the check. Finally wandered up front, paid and left. Won't be going back there."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Pittsburgh! Service is amazing. The food is SO good! All the stars. It's lucky too!! I went on my first date with my husband there :)"}
{"text":"I work in Penn Center and this is one of the favorite spots for lunch in our office.   The food is fresh, tastes great and the service is happy and quick. Lunch never takes a full hour and you never feel rushed. Plus, portions are big so it's great that there's a short walk involved!!  Look for the specials and enjoy your meal!"}
{"text":"After our second visit to Rey Azteca, it clearly deserves a positive review. This Mexican restaurant is located in Riverview Plaza, a strip mall in New Kensington that currently counts Staples and Kmart among its tenants.  This location means that the restaurant is small, but it has a fair number of booths and tables.  On ordering our drinks, we were given an order of chips and salsa. (The first basket is free but subsequent refills are $2.25.) The chips aren't very salty and much less greasy than those from Chili's so they appealed to us. The salsa is restaurant style but not sure if it is homemade or not; I would venture to say no.  The menu itself is large. There are a wide variety of combination plates that can be ordered, as well as standard standalone options such as quesadillas, burritos, tacos, and fajitas. There are also vegetarian options. They also offer some salads, but strangely enough, the only dressing option is ranch.  Be prepared to spend some time reading over the menu before ordering.  The food itself is fairly priced. My wife had a combination plate - taco, chalupa, and quesadilla - that was $10. She had no complaints, and it was a good sampling of each of the various dishes. I had the Pollo Chicken which included two thin and spicy pieces of chicken, guacamole salad, rice, and three soft tortillas. The plate includes refried beans as well, but I passed on those. The chicken was flavored with spicy chipotle sauce but wasn't too hot. The rice was flavorful without being dry and the tortillas were large. This meal was $11.75, and it was delicious.  There is also a bar, and they offer specials on cocktails and other drinks, but we did not partake of those on this visit.  They also offer Coke products.  Other reviewers commented on the directness of the serving staff. While not overly friendly, each individual we encountered was professional and courteous. Our food arrived promptly and was hot.  If you like Mexican food and need somewhere new to eat in the Lower Burrell and New Kensington areas, be sure to try Rey Azteca."}
{"text":"Great place to get Mexican if you're in the Wilkins/Monroeville area. Good food delivered hot, and good waitstaff. They are friendly, the place is clean and well maintained. A good stop for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Great prices and good food. One of the only Mexican places in Pittsburgh that I have enjoyed. You have to try the Mark Burrito."}
{"text":"Extremely clean with an attentive and personable waiter, large menu, generous portions and low prices make this a great stop.  My chicken mole enchiladas were excellent and,  at $10, a great value. Not an upscale place but definitely a place to go!  Recommended."}
{"text":"Words don't quite describe how awesome this place is. Amazing prices set you up to think the food may not be as amazing but it is. Best authentic Mexican food I've had in years. Service is even better. In less than a minute after coming in I was already seated, got the water I asked for and a huge bowl of warm to the touch nachos and cool and fresh salsa. Unbelievable. I ordered the Burritos Deluxe. INCREDIBLE!! After the first burrito I felt it needed a kick so I asked for hot sauce. Oh god did they deliver. They placed two jars on the table. First I tried the green chilie. That was so hot it got my mouth on fire and my nose running! Woo!! Then I tried the other kind. I look at the bottle to see \"XXXTRA HOT SAUCE\". Oh hell. It's like pouring jet fuel on a burning barn. This is what I'm talkin about!! This place is an absolute must for anyone who likes Mexican food. The atmosphere as well as the staff is wonderful. What a pleasant and unexpected suprise. LOVE IT! First place from me to get FIVE STARS!!"}
{"text":"The location is wonky. A group of coworkers are adamant about this place but it takes almost 30 minutes at lunchtime and stupid 22 traffic to get here. Have no idea why but it's super crowded and small.   Food was unmemorable and the selection wasn't too big. Service was okay but nothing about this place stood out. It may be that I'm not a huge Mexican food fan, but prices were on the higher side for beans and rice and the portions were medium sized.  Meh. Probably would never come back here unless someone treated me."}
{"text":"Great place.  Great food. I love the ranchero chicken and the fajitas.    I'm from Western PA and not an aficionado of Mexican food, but it is among the best I've had in the area.    I wish it were in downtown New Kensington rather than a strip mall."}
{"text":"Fantastic food with excellent service. Fresh, and you get a great free appetizer of nachos. And killer margaritas!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great! They serve fresh warm (and free!) chips and salsa once you sit down. Service is prompt! There were other staff members bringing us our drinks, food, and chip refills like thirty seconds after we asked for more. The menu has pretty much everything you need from a mexican restaurant. I give this place 4 stars because I don't think the quality of the restaurant is stellar. But it's great if you want to get away from the Americanized Mad-Mex-esque places. Last night we had a chicken burrito, chicken fajita, and a beef soft taco. There was some confusion on the single beef taco and they had to fix it twice, but were super kind and patient for my picky cousin! I tipped a little extra for their effort, it was greatly appreciated. The fajitas were straight forward, the chicken pieces were smaller, but overall they were good. The refried beans and rice were actually really delicious as well! The staff graciously brought us extra sour cream and cheese when we asked and didn't charge us extra. Don't miss out on the margaritas!!"}
{"text":"Have never had a bad experience in the 2 plus years I've been going here. Great food at low prices."}
{"text":"First time here. Service was not great. We sat for a long time before anyone actually acknowledged us. Then after we got drinks no one came back to take our order. We were two seconds from leaving before someone stopped to grab our orders and take our menus. When we got our food (which was fast!) we weren't impressed. The enchiladas poblanos (pictured) were way sweeter then I expected. I know mole has a sweet element to it, but sweet was all I could taste. Not spicy like it said in the description. The dish lacked flavor, it was very disappointing. The prices here are slightly higher then other (and much tastier) Mexican restaurants that I have been to. Points for the beautiful artwork thought the restaurant but unfortunately, I don't see a reason to come back."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Prompt service. Love the chips and salsa. We have been there several times and brought out of town visitors."}
{"text":"I was so happy to have a Mexican restaurant open in the neighborhood again. Thankfully, I was not disappointed. Food is good. Service is good. Staff is friendly. We make sure to go at least once a month, if not more often."}
{"text":"Kindest wait staff. Quickest service. So many vegetarian options. Awesome food. If I could give this place six stars, I would happily!   For a table of five, we were served our food about fifteen minutes after ordering. Our waiter was the sweetest and was so incredibly attentive. My drink was hardly half gone before he was refilling it.   I ordered the #8 (or #7?) vegetarian option, which was a mushroom and spinach quesadilla. I don't know what they put in there, but it was sinful how good this $8 dish tasted.   Total bill for five people was $66. And my dad drank two beers! Great place for a quick, tasty meal!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today. It's was very inexpensive and the service was good. I will return. Toco Tuesday is going to be my next visit."}
{"text":"Ate there wed Dec 3 2015. And as usual the food was excellent I was there for lunch but ordered the combination dinner price was still very reasonable quality of the food was outstanding and this has to be one of the best Mexican restaurants in the area hands down you need to eat here"}
{"text":"I had lunch here on Tuesday with a couple employees.  I know Ray really likes mexican food and found out Jessica did as well, so thought we'd try this new place conveniently located just a couple miles from the office.  I didn't notice it for a while even though I practicaly drive by it every day.  The restaurant is in a converted burger king,,, drive through window still attached.  However, they did a pretty good job of redecorating the relatively small space inside with plenty of booths and a few tables and what you'd expect with respect to the rest of the decorations.  We sat at a booth and the place was relatively empty, however service was still a bit slow.  They brought over a complimentary basket of chips that were warm and tasty.  The first basket is on the \"house\", but it's $2 a basket after that the salsa was a bit meh', kind of lacked a crisp flavor due to a lack of cilantro I'd guess and wasn't spicy at all.  After a relatively long wait we were greeted by a nice enough mexican guy who took our order.  The lunch prices are super reasonable.  You can get a really good portion of good mexican food for about $6.  I ordered the mexican burrito, which is I guess a little different from a regular burrito because it's served with beef tips. It was really good.  The rice was somewhat forgettable and the beans were good.  I also tried a hard taco on the side which was really good.  I think Ray got some type of chicken chimichanga or something and I think Jessica had a burrito as well.  everyone liked the food and it is definitely authentic mexican competing with El Campesino.  I'd say the prices are a bit more reasonable than El Camp' and the quality almost as good.  I've been to El Camp' a ton of times, so I think I need to try more options here befoere I can give it the same rating.  Either way, I'm happy to have a new authentic mexican joint so close to home."}
{"text":"Great food and attentive service.  The Green Chicken Salad is my favorite.  We have eaten here 5-6 times and it has always been a great experience."}
{"text":"Massive delicious portions.  Low prices.   Fast friendly service.  Giant menu with something for everyone.  Muy bien!"}
{"text":"Oh my god this some good shit. After I ate here this shit made me feel like a real Mexican. Jesus fuck this food is good I had a chimmy chonga stuffed with shrimp and oh my fuck. Damn that's some good shit."}
