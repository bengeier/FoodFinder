{"text":"Decent burger and great price on beer. Reasonably clean place and the staff are friendly and accommodating. Fries were a bit greasy."}
{"text":"Been here many times in the past year....Love it! 1)Millie is AMAZING! She's a great waitress, knows her product and always remembers names and is very sweet and attentive 2) the food...nachos are FANTASTIC!! Cheeseburger is great!! I had a Greek salad yesterday that was good... Not great only because it's a salad and I was pissed off I ate it cause I'm fat...lol 3) LOTS of parking 4) oohhhh the wings are good too...check this place out people!"}
{"text":"Don't usually leave reviews but this restaurant is so good that I had to rave about it.

Millie the waitress/person running the place is amazing. Recommended the nachos as a starter which were tasty.

But the best part was the burger & fries. Burger was delicious! Fries tasted fresh cut. 

The restaurant also has WiFi. 

Will definitely come back. Apparently the fish & chips are great, too."}
{"text":"Had dinner here while staying at the hotel next door. Very friendly service. Food was tasty. Would return if staying here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I checked this place out just after 11pm, tired from a long day of travel from the states. Our bartender Millie was very kind, humorous, and highly informative of the local destination spots. The atmosphere was relaxing and down to earth. We ordered a couple of beers, and luckily the kitchen was still open so we ordered the house special burger and upgraded our fries to poutine. It was delicious! If we had this bar and grill by our house back home we would definitely be regular customers."}
{"text":"An amazing place after a long flight.  Great food, great...really amazing service!

The lovely woman taking care of the bar/dining room is beyond amazing.  Sweet, sharp, fun and genuinely cared about customers.

And the food is very good!"}
{"text":"Michelle and Kate were AWESOME! Atmosphere was phenomenal. Got the chicken sandwich and fries which were both outstanding. Will be back again next time I fly out of Pearson!"}
{"text":"I honestly only stay at the Best Western next door because of Cities Sports Bar. When it's freezing I know I only have to walk next door to get good food and drinks.  Millie is so sweet, fast service, and she says \"cheers\" every time she drops off your drink.
You can either sit at the bar or at tables in the restaurant. There are tv's, a pool table, and WiFi. Can't ask for much more than that!"}
{"text":"Had a great time at cities sports bar and grill.  The waitress was kind and helpful (serving and refilling drinks) and the food was amazing.  Ordered the nacho plate along with a burger and fries with 2 of my friends while watching the raptors game.  Will definitely come back to this place!"}
{"text":"Tonight, hubster and I decided to change things up and forgo the amazing burgers and fried fish in favor of something healthier. We both ordered the chicken breast dinner with fresh (not frozen) vegetable blend and mashed potatoes instead of heavenly fries. The vegetables were crisp-tender, the chicken was beautifully seasoned and the potatoes were hand mashed from real potatoes with small lumps and bits of skin. Yummy! Very little butter is used so they are lighter and more potato-y.


Back again!  This time, we explored the appetizer section...calamari, nachos and breaded wings.
The calamari was very nicely prepared...breaded, deep fried, skinny rings, but large diameter, if that makes any sense. The wings were split between Sweet-n-spicy Thai and a whiskey bbq sauce. The spicy sauce had some twang to it, but nothing that made one seek out a large libation to quench the burn and the bbq was on the sweeter side, but good flavor. The nachos were ordered \"plain\" on purpose and they were very satisfying....a flat, even layer of chips heavily covered with melted cheese.  So far, we have tried about half the menu and have yet to find anything we would not order again.  Try the Hemp beer on tap (draught)!"}
{"text":"Charlotte is gone and so has this establishment.  No longer has the feel of \"outsiders\" are welcome.

Found this gem of a place a month ago.  The bartender Gemma is amazing.   Most places won't give you 2 seconds.  But here everyone is treated like Norm from Cheers.   

If it were not for the hospitality from Gemma I would have rated this place a 3.   But I keep going back and the place is starting to feel like your own home town pub.  

Food is amazing (I've had almost everything on the menu), don't expect a super fast delivery of your order because everything is made fresh at that time.

Thanks Gemma for making my away time on the road enjoyable and made to feel like a true friend.

So everyone, go to this place you will not be disappointed !   

PS:  Niro is way nicer,  but Gemma has appeal."}
{"text":"I don't normally enjoy burgers! But these ones are fantastic :)

16.99 for a jalape√±o cheddar burger

+ 2$ for salad alternative

So juicy hand made pattys...

Mhmmm I'll defiantly be back"}
{"text":"Great service and even better food and beer. You have to try the nachos. Fantastic time!"}
