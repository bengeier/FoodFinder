{"text":"Today, we stopped in for our first visit. The aroma that surrounded the building pulled us in! The Sky was preparing for a large party but happily accomodated us. They had a buffet set up for the celebration and it all looked amazing.   We ordered an appetizer of stuffed grape leaves and as we enjoyed them (they were the best we've had), guests began arriving for the party. There was lively music and the atmosphere was warm, friendly and fun.   We were very well taken care of by our server as she attended to our table needs regularly on top of serving the party guests. We each ordered a falafel pita wrap that also came with fries. Everything tasted fresh and the falafel was seasoned perfectly. Each wrap offered a moist combination of traditional fresh ingredients that offered light and well combined flavors. We were given a generous sized wrap and could only finish half. Their menu offered all of our favorite Mediterranean dishes.  Included was a generous portion of unsalted fries. We do not enjoy salty fries so we were very pleased by this.   The Sky offers live music on Thursday-Saturday and boasts an outdoor patio featuring a huge brick fireplace and hearth.   Prices were more than reasonable for the large servings.  I am not sure who we met at the door upon arriving and departing, but we felt like we were treated like family. We give the Sky five stars for their welcome, friendliness and service, the fresh food and bright, clean and fresh atmosphere. Yep...this is our new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Very good food . I loved everything that I ordered except the little grape leaf burrito things, but I think that was just my taste in food. I gave it a four star because the atmosphere was very like 'whatever' like the waitress looked like she rather be anywhere else. Also, it took about an hour for some hummus, which I thought was a little long. But overall, everything was fine."}
{"text":"Second time in, first time was a dine in, great authentic Mediterranean food, the service was great, but the food is a bit pricy for the selections but worth it. The second time was in for the takeout, the sandwiches were done on time and was very tasty. Still gotta try the live music nights which I hear that they are pretty good."}
{"text":"The food is incredible with a lot of authentic flavor, but the pricing is a little outrageous. As soon as they make the menu a little more affordable it could be a serious staple in the community."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food that we couldn't stop eating!  Fresh ingredients and Big portions made the price worth it. Left stuffed and still took a lot home with us!"}
