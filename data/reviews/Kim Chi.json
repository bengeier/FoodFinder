{"text":"Worst Korean food made by nonKoreans. Nearly inedible. Thy are not sure how to make dishes. Example: kimchee fried rice.... Didn't have kimchee. He had it in a different bowl, said it didn't need it. It was soy sauce based. Need I go further?"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! They make a delicious bimbimbap :)
I can't unfortunately speak for anything else because I always order the same thing when I visit Calgary ;)"}
{"text":"Dinner at the mall means Pad Sew noodles for my little boy so my husband and I take turns eating the other half.  Today was my turn to get to order something different.  I decided to try Kim Chi.  I've never had Bibimap but I've heard great things.  I knew that the food court version would not be the best ever but it sounded like a great new thing to try.

The bibimap serving was generous but it was room temperature almost cold. I'm not a super picky about food temp but it would have tasted better warmer.  The chicken looked a bit weird but tasted fine.  You get two sauces, sesame oil and a hot sauce, with your bibimap.  You pour some of both on and mix it up.  I really enjoyed the hot sauce. It had a hot and sweet taste that I really enjoyed.  

Overall the food was okay but I don't find myself wanting to go back right away.  I am, however, curious to try bibimap somewhere different."}
{"text":"If I could  I'd probably give them 0 or minus!!!  Terrible service!!  Food is not fresh and actually if u let it sit for 5 min B4 u eat u be very surprised to c how hard it gets...  
The server made a few mistakes with my order and kinda gave me attitude when I asked her to fix it (even when she gave a frozen mango juice as my drink). I would never come back and would make sure all my friends know about it,  would recommend to eat everything else other then that"}
{"text":"You are not eating here for the ambiance in the Market Mall food court nor for the lacking, robotic service.
BUT, if you are hungry, love noodle soups and want to stray from the typical fatty burgers and pizza, try out the number 1 with chicken on this menu. It is a vermicelli noodle soup with bean sprouts that will warm you to the bones and the one size is enough to feed 2 adults. Delicious. The broth has the perfect seasoning with garlic, green onion and I did not need to add anything other than a little hot sauce on the protein. Lots of noodles, which I love.
Quick and satisfying, I would order this again. You can also get them to pack it to go apparently - they will keep the noodles separate so the whole thing is not overcooked by the time you get home.
Frugal choice, under $9 per bowl and they will give you a coupon for a free drink with meal for next time."}
{"text":"Really good, fresh and fast Korean stir fry.  I asked for spicy  but it was very barely seasoned.  Fresh vegetables and friendly service.  Great meal for under $10!"}
{"text":"I totally forgot that I ate here before and ordered the kimchi stir fry.  I should have checked Yelp and I would have seen that this place sucks.  We waited (I shit you not!) over 20 minutes for our lunch, standing in a line.  No apologies, treated like a herd of sheep getting a pile of soggy flavorless noodles one after the other.  I can't believe I didn't remember I ate here before.  Again it was gross.  This time I mean it: I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Bibimbap was goood.  Bulgogi was barley cooked as well as soup chicken dumplings.    Worth it for korean food"}
{"text":"My seafood soup was hot and the seafood (shrimp and scallops) was incredibly fresh. I was very pleasantly surprised with how fresh these ingredients were in mall food!"}
{"text":"The meet was horrible and me and my girlfriend order at the same plate and the taste was different?"}
{"text":"Vraiment aimer frais et pas cher et halal! Tres surprise et heureuse! Dans le centre commercial place versaille. Léger et goûteux"}
{"text":"This is the closest korean food Restaurant I can go to.
I went there with my friend, after goig to the gym.

It's a chain, I know there is one downtown at Eaton Center. Kim Chi is part of the choices in the main foodcourt.

I tried two of their meals 

1) bibimbap, which was ok, id give it a 3/5
2) japchae, tasty, not as good as in korean restaurants though, maybe 3-3.5/5

Missing a bit of flavour.
No sidedishes (i think thats only in sitting in restaurants)

Service is very quick of course.
About 10$/meal. Good portions!"}
{"text":"The place is called \"KIm Chi Korean Delight.\"

On a rare-ish trip to Market Mall a few weeks ago I had lunch at Kim Chi in the food court. I had #6, rice cake stir fried with your choice of meat and chose chicken. Spicy. It was fantastic- superb even. The rice cake was beautifully cooked and the toppings including the chicken itself plenty generous. The flavour was a perfect mix of salty-pungent-spicy and I could have eaten two orders of this. I can't speak to the rest of the menu but it's going to be a challenge ordering anything else, this was just fantastic. I did note that you can get a host of things a la carte- mandu, rice, kimchee, etc so there are opportunities to sample other items.

I'd put this place up there with the basil fried rice at Thai Express, the shrimp dumpling noodle soup at Sukiyaki and the fish burrito at Taco Del Mar as the cream of the crop for foodcourt dishes in Calgary. Very happy I tried it."}
{"text":"Brand new Korean fast food place to join the Market Mall food court area.  Kim Chi offers noodle soups, rice dishes like Bibimbap, BBQ beef ribs (kalbi) on rice, beef/chicken/ on rice, Kim Chi noodles (fried), and japchae (glass noodles).  

My family members tried the Bibimbap and the Kim Chi noodles.  I had a taste of each dish.  It wasn't too bad.  The Bibimbap rice should be a little warmer and it came with different items like spinach, carrots, and other vege and the one we had ordered was chicken.  Tasty but a little on the cool side.  This dish actually came with a side order add-on of a dumpling soup for $1.76 but they didn't have any dumplings today.  :o(

The Kim Chi noodles was nice and hot and a little more spicy and had the the Kim Chi in the noodles.  We ordered that with beef.  Not bad.

Each dish was about $7 to $9.

They accept cash and only debit cards.  No credit cards.  That was a downer for me."}
