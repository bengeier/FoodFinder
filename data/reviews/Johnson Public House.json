{"text":"The only place that carries Intelligensia's espresso beans in Madison, WI!  It's the only cafe that people must try in Madison!"}
{"text":"Just go for the espresso. Get it in a latte or a mocha. I've only been here twice but each time the espresso has tasted the way espresso should taste: sweet and tangy. If you are an espresso lover like me and need to find a place to stop in Madison, do not waste your time with other places. Ignore the hipsters and get your quality coffee at JPH."}
{"text":"Immediately upon turing onto Johnson St we were able to distinguish Johnson Public House by the significant number of people sitting outside. Once we walked in the door, we were overwhelmed by a mixture of students studying for classes and families grabbing Sunday brunch. It was extremely warm inside, so be sure to dress in layers! In terms of the menu, you can definitely tell that Johnson Public House specializes in beverages. The tea list was extremely extensive and the number of ways one could order their coffee was significant. The brunch menu was pretty limited, containing mainly breakfast bowls and sandwiches. Despite having a limited food menu, Johnson Public House managed to master the few menu items they do have. I ordered the \"Regular\" sandwich and was extremely impressed by the flavor of the ham and perfect preparation of fried egg. I would definitely recommend stopping by if you are looking for a homey place to get work done, a grade a coffee or tea spot, or a delicious brunch sandwich!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite coffee place in Madison. I love the lattes. Good for a beer outside during the summer too"}
{"text":"The Coffee here is good but they don't serve a dark roast which is what I normally like to order.  Also they make some good sandwiches, I've tried the roast beef and the tuna, both were excellent.  I like the set up of the cafe, its a nice atmosphere to hang out in.  I would give this place 5 stars but their service is incredibly slow.  I've ordered a sandwich when the place was almost empty and it still took them over 20 minutes to make it.  In addition, I once waited in line with literally one family ahead of me and it took them 10 minutes just to take our order. So all in all, it's a nice place to drink a cup of coffee and study/work or hang out with friends, and the food tastes good but not a good place to go if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Very cute inside, I loved the art work. The coffee is expensive -- and honestly, exactly how I make it at home, because our coffee pot broke and  the pour-over method works just as well -- but worth it because of the atmosphere. And so close to my work!"}
{"text":"Slow service with an attitude and emo in the background. Rather expensive and very snooty. Kid at the register was blatantly inattentive and had mumbled responses to questions. Waited a long time to order, longer for a coffee and even long for a Tuna Melt (+ 40 minutes). Will not be coming here again. Would rather walk the few extra blocks to one of the other cafes nearby with better service."}
{"text":"Indeed, the Johnson Public House is a welcome addition to this neighborhood.  As a long-time Company of Thieves customer, I'd agree that overall this is a pretty major improvement --way better coffee drinks, much nicer atmosphere, better food, etc.  The influx of customers attests to this location's new-found spirit.

That said, I do sort of miss the total lack of pretentiousness that came along with the so-so lattes of the previous establishment.  And the near 100% outlet coverage.

All in all, though, for me this place has just about the right balance of hipster ardor and yuppie comfort.  If I were in Madison still, I'd probably be there right now."}
{"text":"I adore JPH because it is completely unassuming.  The decor is charming and vintage, the staff is knowledgable, and the breakfast/coffee is top notch.  I went in today and had yogurt and granola, and even something as simple as this was presented in such an appetizing way.  The fresh berries on the yogurt made my morning treat colorful and even more delicious.  

I am happy the construction in the area has stopped for now and the only noises that I  hear in the shop are customers quietly chatting/enjoying their coffee and the staff hard at work...

Keep up the good work JPH, we're your biggest fans!"}
{"text":"I gave up looking for good coffee in Madison for the whole year before JHP was recommended to me by a friend. Needless to say I've been drinking coffee since Apr of 2011."}
{"text":"What more can you want in a coffee shop that perfect coffee, FREE internet, delicious noms, AND beer/wine? This place has become my home away from home for productivity. They have large, inviting study tables, a variety of music that I enjoy (ranging from soul and jazz to hip-hop), and a very polite crowd with people that take their cellphone conversations outside so you don't get distracted by some guy talking to his mom for an hour. 
Their ham croissant sandwich is quite good, as are their side salads. Though their grilled cheese has so much cheese that it makes me a little queasy at times, but I attribute that to the fact that I am not from Wisconsin and my stomach is still settling in."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite coffee in Wisconsin. I've been coming to Johnson Public House just about since it opened up, and it was a game changer for my idea of what coffee can be. They have consistently served the best roasters in the country, often long before they become the next hot thing, and now themselves roast some of the best beans you can buy. The staff is all well trained, extremely kind and caring, and will go out of their way to serve you the best possible shot of espresso/pourever etc. What really throws it all over the top are the owners. They have become anchors in the community and have totally invested in making Madison a better city. They take care of me like family, and have always given the coffee shop a warm, cozy, welcoming feel which is rare in the third wave coffee culture that is often cold/ultra-modern, and at time snobby and alienating. The owners and crew are top tier, just as is their coffee. Stellar, stellar coffee.

Added bonus, they have some FANTASTIC food options too! Try them out.
Also, you might see their cute mobile setup at Madison area events, and they are in the process of opening a second location!"}
{"text":"When I walked in to Johnson Public House, I fell in love. Known as a coffeeshop, this place offers more than I expected. The staples are here: seating, wi-fi, coffee/tea. The Masala chai tea was quite soothing, as tea normally is. I came to the establishment to do some work, but then, I was captivated by the place and decided to stay for a meal. I got the Roast beef breakfast sandwich, which was the size of a normal meal. I think this is sometimes overlooked. The cuisine isn't cutting edge, but it was tasty. If you're coming for world-class cuisine, there are other venues you should look for. However, if you are looking for a great cafe, this is the place for you.

I can't stop talking about the atmosphere of the place. The music was great, starting off with indie hits of the past few years and transitioning into the oldies that my dad used to play when I was growing up. It made me want to stay there and work indefinitely. Surprisingly, the caf√© was not that crowded on a Sunday afternoon (in the fall). There was also plenty of space to do work, whether you wanted to be seated bar-style or at a table."}
{"text":"It would be four or a five -- they really are doing a lot right -- but the coffee is just too expensive.  I won't be going there anymore until they lower the prices.  It is a good business strategy, the coffee is good, but the prices are still just plain too high.  If they were the highest in town, but still within reach, I'd go all the time.  But the prices a just plain too high.  I feel like a poor person excluded from a place designed for folks with more disposable income."}
{"text":"Happy to find a vegan breakfast that isn't tofu scramble! Their avocado toast is normally made with butter on it, but without the butter it's excellent, with probably a generous half an avocado on each slice, and salt and pepper and some kind of yummy but mysterious seasoning blend. The bread is some amazing variety from Madison Sourdough. With a cold brew, two slices of this is my ideal breakfast.

Really mellow atmosphere, mostly students it seems, with an unexpected corner with a box of blocks for little ones that mine enjoys."}
{"text":"Love this place. They definitely know coffee. They serve some of the best coffee in Madison - and do so consistently! Made with care each and every time. The chai is pretty good, too. Nice staff and great music choices."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere at Johnson Public House a lot. It's open, airy, humble, and filled with morning light.

I had my first breakfast at JPH today, and a few notes:

- There isn't much in the way of a vegan breakfast, but there are vegetarian options including eggs with salad and toast or yogurt and housemade granola. The granola comes with dairy yogurt, but I've seen other Yelp reviews indicating it can be served with soy milk instead. 

- The breakfast service was a little lacking. My companion and I ordered breakfast bowls and they came with forks but no knives. There was one salt and pepper shaker set in the shop, and their contents weren't of very high quality or flavor.

- Soy milk costs extra, but on the plus side, when I asked for a splash of soy milk in my coffee, the barista gave me a little pitcher to accompany my little carafe of coffee. I appreciated that. 

I like Madison Sourdough much better for the same sort of breakfast (higher quality bread, better flavor in the eggs and seasonings, and more thorough service at a lower price for the same meal), but I'll continue to frequent JPH for coffee dates. And I'll see if I can get that granola served with soy milk if I'm in the need for a sweet, crunchy breakfast."}
{"text":"Great coffee that's a mix of local + wonderful folks like 4 Barrel. Perfect Madison vibe and I had an out of this world tuna sandwich there. Yes, tuna can be out of this world - I even got it w/o cheese."}
{"text":"JPH is the best coffee shop in Madison, with only 5th Element making good competition for the title. They have a diverse and rotating selection of fantastic coffees from a variety of roasters. The atmosphere just feels quintessentially Madison in its casual and comfortable vibe. They take espresso drinks and pour-overs very seriously, and the food they serve is great in a pinch. It's a perfect place to study or talk about coffee."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee selection and attention to quality preparation. They make a homemade granola that is absolutely delicious, and if you're there early enough they usually have a selection of Batch pastries. Also a great place to transition from coffee work time to beer work time!"}
{"text":"As a senior under-grad at UW, I am well versed in the coffee universe. Or so I thought.

Without a doubt the strongest, which is my definition for highest quality, coffee I have ever tasted. Still, the coffee at JPH is as good or better, in terms of taste, when compared to any other coffee served in the greater Madison area. It should be noted that I have yet to try Bradbury's, though. 

The coffee: Unbelievable strength, powerful in taste. And yes, PJH is expensive. But my 12 oz cup of coffee, which priced at $3.38 after tax, contained more than enough punch to last all day.

The ambiance:  I longed for a soft chair/couch to sit on, otherwise pretty darn good.

The food: Looked/smelled great. Have heard good things, didn't give it a try.

Best coffee in town."}
{"text":"Definitely the best coffee in Madison. The latte is amazing. It's also a great place to bring your laptop and sit for as long as you want. Good music and very good sandwiches, too."}
{"text":"Extremely knowledgeable baristas paired with high quality coffee result in the best cup of coffee Madison has to offer.

I love the fact that they specialize in pour over coffee.  So much so that I actually hate having to drink drip anywhere else.  

In addition to the life changing brew, they offer fresh bakery from Batchhouse and small, but delicious food menu.  The Beef Brisket breakfast sandwich will melt in your mouth.

In addition to coffee and food JPH offers up craft beers, and a wine selection.  Add to that free wifi, books, board games, open mic night, a doggie friendly dish out front, and Johnson Public is the place to chill."}
{"text":"Such a quality place! Such an enjoyable atmosphere!

And yet food & snacks so, so expensive!! $3.80 for a croissant? Must it be so??

I will certainly continue to go and enjoy, but will not be buying anything but coffee, which is definitely well worth the price."}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff took time to explain their brewing processes and flavors. Food and coffee were both enjoyable. Sunday Morning breakfast sandwich is stellar mix of savory and sweet with syrup flavor. Overall, a wonderful neighborhood cafe."}
{"text":"I'm continuing to enjoy JPH.

Very good, higher quality/priced coffee and pastries. The breakfast sandwich is bomb and i would happily argue that they have the finest prepared cup of coffee in Madison, if not Wisconsin. 

While some have labeled this place pretentious, i have always had great interactions with the owners and barristas. In regards to the \"pour over\" vs. already prepared coffee and their prices, you must remember that this business is not run on the quantity over quality concept (i.e. Starbucks, Pete's). They pay a premium for their products too in order to serve the best of the best, so they must charge more. Some people see it fine to pay $100 for a bottle of wine. While that may not be something i would ever do, i can respect and understand the reasoning behind purchasing such a luxury on occasion. Their coffee is the same way. It is the best you can buy. Thus, It is more expensive than the rest. If that's not your thing, then don't drink it. Just don't knock them for caring.

long story short, if you like quality coffee and a chill environment, give Johnson Public House a shot (no pun intended)."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere.  The food is awesome, the coffee and tea are amazing, and the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop in Madison. The coffee is stellar and the baristas are friendly. The shop itself is cozy and inviting with mismatched chairs and tables, and I love the art they hang on the walls. They sell some local artisan products, such as hand sewn aprons and things, which is yet another reason to love JPH. 

Great quality of food and drinks, you really can't go wrong with anything they've got. 

I also love their story slams! So much fun! JPH, you're the best!"}
{"text":"Fuck this place for closing at 6 all the sudden rather than 10 as published, sending me back into the cold snow without a hot chocolate. If you don't like the winter, go back to Portland.

Businesses that establish and publish standard business hours, then violate them at will, are disrespecting their customers. Seeya at Starbucks!"}
{"text":"Love this place, a very welcome addition to the neighborhood. A very new business so they're probably still working things out but I have a few suggestions: would love to see some house-made ice cold LEMONADE (especially during the summer when patrons are in search of a reprieve from their suffocating apts). The bottled stuff in the fridge is fine, but I sort of expect more from a coffee/tea house. Also, not sure if the owners have ever had/made COLD-BREWED iced coffee...it's amazing and would def compliment their otherwise excellent coffee selection. Finally, the sandwiches are quite good, but would nice to see a bit more creativity (esp. on the vegetarian front). Otherwise, a very awesome establishment!"}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and I were visiting Madison for the weekend, and we ended up going to JPH twice. I thought the roast beef breakfast sandwich was one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. The beef, egg, caramelized onion, provolone and sriracha mayo is just a ridiculously good combination, on delicious bread. Other stuff we had was great too, including the \"Regular\" breakfast sandwich, espresso drinks and yogurt/granola, but for me the roast beef breakfast sandwich was on a different level.

Will absolutely be going back any time I come to Madison."}
{"text":"Eclectic art work and furniture, chill wait staff, great indie music playing through the speakers, wait...digital scales to measure out your product?

This place is one set of statutes away from being a \"Dutch\" coffee house.

Until then, best cup of coffee you'll ever have."}
{"text":"This was the first place I ventured to after moving toward the east side of Madison. It's a very calm place, lots of seating, quiet ambience, just the perfect place to study, enjoy a meal, or just relax. The baristas are always helpful and friendly and provide excellent service.

The first food I tried was the Sunday morning breakfast sandwich with homemade chips. And ever since, that has been my default food item of choice when coming here. Fresh ingredients, freshly pressed, and that touch of maple are unbeatable. Another favorite of mine is the homemade granola and yogurt. You can definitely taste the quality in their granola - it has the perfect crunch, never stale. A lot of places have granola with that corn syrup taste, but not JPH. And the inclusion of cashews is just another level of finesse that makes their granola so superb. It also comes with fresh fruit, big bonus.

In terms of coffee, I myself always get an iced decaf. And I must say, the coffee they use is quite high quality, so I definitely didn't mind paying the premium over generic Starbucks decaf. Their roast just has this deep, dark note that makes you know you are drinking straight up coffee and not water that tastes like coffee.

[They do also carry pastries, but if you can, I would recommend you go directly to Batch Bakehouse (not a far bike ride) because you do pay a premium for getting them at JPH)

I highly recommend this place to anyone in Madison."}
{"text":"I have often wondered why the majority of coffee shops in Madison seem to have so little interest in producing truly excellent coffee.  While I still wonder, Johnson Public House runs contrary to this current in most every way.  Their barristas understand the importance of each shot, of producing the perfect place between foam and hot milk which is the basis of every good cappuccino.  Their beans could be used in the best of NW coffee shops and the owners are in the finest tradition of unpretentious Wisconsin.  Their food smells and looks excellent, but it has yet to reach my palette.

The bottom line: their coffee is the best I have yet to have in Madison.  They best Ancora without thinking about it.  I feel like I am home in Portland, OR when I step inside."}
{"text":"Wow - best cappuccino I have had in a long time.  A bit off the beaten path of the State Street area, but well worth the effort.  Better than Barriques, and much better than Steep & Brew.  My new go-to place for coffee in Madison."}
{"text":"If this is your first time in the area, this shop will look like a hole in the wall, as are all the other shops along this street. But don't let the exterior fool you! Please do yourself a favor by enjoying a cup of coffee or a plain double shot espresso at the JPH over a good read on a sunny afternoon. 

The fact that they serve intelligentsia coffee should already indicate their strive for high standards because god knows that stuff is expensive. My espresso was so smooth, so creamy, so fruity delicious; I could drink this stuff all afternoon if it weren't for the high caffeine level. 

The Barista was a little too cool but that may just be me. Next time I'll remember to come dressed in an obscure band t-shit and a scarf. Skinny pants too, if I can ever squeeze into one."}
{"text":"I like how these guys take their coffee so seriously. With a chalkboard wall filled with different blends from all over the world, I seriously thought I had died from coffee overload!! With help from the barista, I ordered a Columbian coffee, which was served pour over style (one of the many ways to get your fix, also: french press, iced, etc.....). This was an intense experience, bold and so strong, that I don't know how I can go back to my reg pot of coffee. I want to try all the blends!

I liked the vibe of the place. It was like every demographic was there from super hipsters, white collars, college kids, and moms with kids. Next time I will def try out some of the noms: portabella sandwich, here I come! JPH has something awesome for everyone!!!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about JPH so I checked out. I was disappointed. It was dirty and dreary, the food was sub-par and overpriced. Sorry friends, I won't bother to return!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the coffee, 3 for the food.  They have a GD CORTADO?!  Haven't seen that since Barcelona.  Coffee is really, really good - Madison - Top Tier.  A bit slow though...please take me back to Seattle where an espresso drink from order to in-my-hand takes less than 5 min.  

We had some of the breakfast sandwiches on the last visit and they were tasty...just a bit, ho-hum."}
{"text":"Great place to get some work done on the weekends and enjoy some excellent and fantastic coffee."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that I have no objection to paying $$$ for a cup of coffee, provided that the beans, the atmosphere, and the locale (i.e. city) justify the cost.

Today I went to the Johnson Public House for the first time and ordered a medium coffee. The barista then said, \"that will be $5.40.\" This astounded me. I've had coffee brewed using the Chemex method and even more inventive ones in San Francisco and other cities and never paid over the $5 mark for a cup (or even close). 

So I ordered down (i.e., a \"lesser\" coffee and smaller cup size). $3.40, the barista quoted. Then I saw that the Johnson Public House does not accept credit cards for amounts under $5. The barista suggested I either buy one of the two pastries available for sale or a bottled water (the irony of a shop that peddles free-trade, high-quality coffee and sells bottled water can't go unremarked). I thought, \"If I am not going to pay $6 for an item I actually did want, why would I pay $6 for items I don't want?\" The reasonable response, if you are a business that needs support as much as the Johnson Public House probably does in order to sustain itself, is to say, \"Okay, we'll accept your credit card this time, but next time, you need cash, because each transaction costs us X amount.\" I could, in fact, have paid the CC fee in change if asked, if that is the real issue.

This coffee shop has barely changed in its various iterations. It is dark. The furniture is second-hand and cheap. There are scant outlets. It is not decorated well enough to justify luxury prices."}
{"text":"JPH offers up the perfect environment to enjoy a killer cup of coffee in Madison. These guys know exactly what they're doing; I have yet to find another coffee house in Wisconsin that not only sells roasts from the likes of Heart and Stumptown, but also prepares the perfect cup every time.
If you're not feelin coffee, there's a great menu to choose from and an impressive selection of beer; this is also the first coffee house I've seen to serve the likes of Three Floyd's Brewing Co.
All in all, JPH is a great stop for anyone to have a good meal, but for those who need exceptional coffee, there's no better place in Madison."}
{"text":"Good overall experience, decor, coffee... the deal breaker for me is the lack of quality wifi.  

As I sit at the table waiting for content to load on my internet browser I can hear customers seated next to me offer under the breath complaints for the wifi.  It's apparent that this oversight is completely overlooked by the staff.  I know this because the streaming music service knows this.  

||  About every 15 seconds the music streaming behind the bar cuts out so that it may buffer and provide another 15-30 seconds spurt of audio.  I commend the baristas for enduring the purgatory created by inadequate wifi and luckily for me my iPhone offers me relief by streaming music directly from my phone.  ||

In all, I enjoy coffee shops for the social experience, the exploration of ideas, and for work.  I see computers on nearly every table and I know the wifi signal is stressed, but it's a simple fix for a coffee shop that otherwise provides such a quality experience.  My efficiency to work greatly diminishes with poor wifi.

So, today I say goodbye to JPH and head downtown to a coffee shop with twice (or three times) the customers with good overall experience, decor, coffee... and the means to meet the wifi needs of the patrons and the staff.  Thank you, Colectivo."}
{"text":"Decent coffee drinks, cozy (hipster) atmosphere consisting of mismatched furniture and squishy chairs in the midst of wooden benches, and the food was okay too.  I could see myself studying there in the future, as there was relatively ample space on a Saturday morning. 

I started with a soy chai latte and the portabello mushroom sandwich; the chai was pretty standard and not anything out of the ordinary (maybe I should've opted for coffee?).  As for the sandwich, I at first was thrown off because the bread was cold although the portabello mushroom was warm, but it grew on me quickly, because the semi-melted mozzarella cuts through along with some kind of sauce they also put on the sandwich.  

I felt that this was slightly overpriced for what I was getting and service was also okay--the woman who took my order made me feel like I was bothering her when I approached the counter.  In terms of quality, it was solid, nothing mindblowing, but still nonetheless a good place to catch up with a friend or get some work done over a warm drink and a snack."}
{"text":"If you love good coffee, this is where you should be.  They always have a few coffees to choose from (mostly Intelligentsia) that rotate pretty frequently. Awesome cold brew and espresso too. The baristas are super talented so if milky drinks are your thing, expect to see some beautiful latte art."}
{"text":"Do you enjoy waiting 20 minutes for an iced tea while wall-to-wall lumbersexuals drink flat whites and read John Darnielle's novel?

I do not enjoy that experience and am weary with this cafe because of it. I really like their granola, but today I had to wait half an hour for mine and was late to a doctor's appointment because of that. 

I am all for the slow food movement, but pointlessly inefficient food is another thing.

Like, why can't they pour an iced tea at the counter when I order it?

I don't drink coffee so I'm not the one being gouged for it here. Therefore, it's just entertaining to watch people pay five bucks for a cup.

I like the way JPH looks. Staff is nice and art is cool. But if I didn't live just a few blocks away, it wouldn't be worth the hassle."}
{"text":"This was an interesting place. I went around Noon on a Thursday; the place was 75% full, primarily with the hipster type. Folks appeared to be 18-25 years old...lots of Apple products. The staff was helpful for a newcomer. It was someone's birthday (maybe JPH's itself), so PBRs were on sale for only a couple bucks. It was very difficult to resist this temptation.

A couple of friends met here for a meeting; one of our friends is a sincere regular, so she guided us. I ordered the Roast Beef Sandwich for $7; this was a particular treat for me considering I don't eat meat too often, and certainly not beef...on a sandwich. The beef, cheese, and caramelized onions were great, very melty. There was a sauce (sriracha involved?) that added some punch. I did not opt for any side dish but in addition to the regular chips, they offered greens or potatoes ($2.5). The menu is definitely breakfast or brunch focused.

JPH's coffee is very good, there is not usually a line and if staff are cooking they know to prioritize a to-go cup of joe before a group of six dining in with sandwiches. The finishes in this cafe are appreciated. It is self serve, so one must get their own silverware, napkins, water then bus the table afterwards, which is fine if you actually know it's a thing. Parking on side streets is totally do-able. I will be back for coffee at least; this location and EVP serve this particular community well."}
{"text":"This is a truly authentic hipster coffee place. Great vibe and wonderful outdoor picnic tables. 

A great place to read, write, and relax!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food- I love the breakfast sandwiches and the granola bowl is delicious!!! Great selection of tea. All around good coffee shop, although it can get quite busy at peak hours, as expected."}
{"text":"Top notch coffee, good hours, free parking, easy to bike to and snacks. What more could you want? I've been seriously disturbed by the lack of good french press and pour over coffee in Madison. This place does both well. 

I like the ambiance. The tables are big, solid and wide, good for getting work done, better than barriques in that respect. I'll be coming here a lot over the next couple of weeks and I'll update if need be. 

For now, I love it.

And it's open until 10!!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, great atmosphere, great food. Even though JPH is a little bit of a trek from my apartment, it's become one of my favorite coffee shops to do some work because it's just so darn cozy. The interior is eclectically decorated, with mismatched chairs and tables and mugs. The baristas have always been nothing but friendly to me and they seem to have a stream of regular customers that they'll chat with at the bar. I have had coffee, iced tea, hot tea (they have a great selection of teas, which I appreciate because I'm more of a tea drinker anyway), as well as their sandwiches (the grilled cheese is absolutely scrumptious). I've ordered the avocado toast too, which is big for me because I usually find that at most places, avocado toast is like six bucks and totally overpriced. Here, it's a more reasonable $3 and you can add an egg for like a dollar to have a pretty filling breakfast-while-you-work for four bucks! Obviously, you can make it for cheaper at home but hey, then you'd miss out on the lovely ambiance of JPH. 

There's also some nice picnic tables outdoors that is a great place to get some sun on nicer days -- the outdoor seating + indoor seating does fill up fairly quick though so if you're coming on the weekend, be prepared."}
{"text":"I live three blocks away from this spot, and could not be happier to have JPH as my local coffee shop. The lattes are fantastic, and one of my favorite sandwiches of all time has got to be the Sunday morning breakfast sandwich, which has ham, egg, cheese, and just a touch of maple syrup. OMG. My only gripe would be that this place ain't cheap, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"its just too pricey for a double shot of espresso.  really it is.

I went to the handsome roasters cafe, had a double pulled by one of the OWNERS and it was still cheaper than at JPH. is it me or is that weird? LA is fucking expensive. 
I went to Barista in Portland Oregon, had a double pulled by AN AWARD WINNING BARISTA and it was still cheaper than at JPH. I can go on and I will...
Went to Coava, Stumptown, The Refinery, all pretty pretentious places but still cheaper.

just saying ,you guys are pretentious as F***
but i like to go every once in while when iI feel like blowing some coin.

maybe your rent is super crazy expensive or all these colleges kids are trust fund babies or taking at massive loans to feed there coffee habits.....

lets be reasonable eh?

PS but i love the fact you guys serve LADRO, haven't seen them in a long time. kinda cute."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. Absolutely phenomenal. 

You know a place really hit all the high points when you walk out saying that it is a MUST VISIT destination whenever you return to the area. This place is that good.

From the breakfast sandwich, with perfectly crisped fresh bread complete with Wisconsin cheddar and the perfect hint of maple syrup to the presentation of their hand-crafting each of your drinks while you wait (this is what you pay for when drinks are $3-$6 to those who are complaining of the prices on Yelp) to the fantastic craft beer selection, complete with Bells Hopslam, a small selection of Ale Asylum, and 5, count em FIVE offerings of Three Floyds beers (Arctic Panzer Wolf the highlight of the bunch) while we were here, this place is just great. 

They brew excellent Intelligentsia coffee (a product of the owner being from Chicago, one would surmise), provide free internet in a chill, laid back setting perfect for anything from a hangover brunch to cramming for finals, provide an incredible selection of different coffees (and methods to brew the coffee) and teas, and they bring the drinks and food to your table as soon as it is ready, with a smile. What more could you possibly want out of a combination coffeehouse/breakfast place/Starbucks with craft beer type establishment?

We will absolutely be back, and we will be recommending this place to everyone we know visiting the area - this place is that fantastic. Not to be missed."}
{"text":"I truly cannot express how much I love this place. I dream about it every weekend.  Last time my buddy and I drove up from Chicago to Madison we stopped here before even telling our friends that we were in town! It's that good.
I've gone three times now and each time I get the same thing \"Sunday Morning\" Sandwich. Ham + maple syrup + cheddar + fried egg = WOW.  Their bread is really terrific and crustless as well.

GO here as much as possible Madisonites. This place is one of a kind."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best espresso in Madison. Owners Gwen & Kyle care about what they do, and I love supporting a local, family owned business that puts out a world class product."}
{"text":"Mother's Day with my guy and his daughter. 

The food:  Potatoes nice and crispy, egg slightly over cooked (I like it runny) and fabulous seeded rye bread from Madison Sourdough. Just the right size serving, No waste and not stuffed.

The Coffee: Ordered the basic cup. It was delicious. Wish they had the capacity to reheat when the coffee gets cold.

The ambiance: Diners mostly students. Place could use a fresh coat of paint and some TLC. Bordered on dirty. Need to update some of the chairs. 

Staff: Friendly and helpful

I know some of you think I am too picky but even shabby chic needs to be both clean and comfy.

I shall return."}
{"text":"Johnson Public House has been better in the recent past. Prices keep going up. Just a few months ago, a sandwich came with greens and a few berries. Now sandwiches are more expensive and greens are extra ($2.50). No boost in quality to justify the price increase. WiFi is spotty at best. I think I've gone here for the last time, which is too bad because watching the latest waves of hipster wash over JPH (railroad caps, suspenders, new facial hair patterns) has been amusing."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try JPH on a day off after seeing a lot of very good reviews on Yelp. We dropped in around 10:30 on a Monday, and there were a handful of tables available. It didn't take more than five minutes to put our order in. 

The atmosphere is very chill at JPH, and the service lacks urgency, but in a friendly way. The decor includes several nature-centric paintings, and the furniture is comprised of large tables and a random assortment of chairs. With several windows at the front of the building facing the street, there is plenty of natural light and it's easy to relax here. 

We ordered the following: 

- Roast Beef Breakfast Sandwich
- Granola (large)
- Peach Tea
- Finagro Tanzanian (16 oz)

To my knowledge, this is the only place in Madison currently serving Intelligentsia coffee, and the selections rotate very frequently while mixing and matching other roasters. Preparation here is very deliberate, so don't plan on walking in for a coffee and walking out 45 seconds later. 

My coffee was fantastic, and my wife was very happy with her peach tea. The granola was prepared with fresh strawberries, blueberries and yogurt, and was a filling portion. The beef on the breakfast sandwich I had was tender, but didn't quite fall apart. The flavors -- from the sriracha aioli and caramelized red onions -- played off each other effectively, and the texture was outstanding thanks to the grilled country sourdough bread. As other reviews have noted, the sandwiches with eggs here feature hard boiled eggs, rather than fried ones. It's different, but it worked on the sandwich I had. 

Yelp Scorecard

Food: 4.5
Service: 3.75

{"text":"Sorry to be a hater, but I tried this place based on the Yelp recommendations.  Problem was, I had just tried the Johnson Brothers coffee (no relation to Johnson Public House that I know of), and it was like drinking the Devil's sock water after drinking a glass of God's pure, melted glacial ice.

Terrible.

Short of it is that I have come to distrust the coffee houses that have the baristas prepare the coffee, drip-style, in front of the customer.  To a place, I have found the end resulted (1) expensive and (2) disappointing.  That is true of JPH: nice Baristas, but the end result was bitter, watery with absolutely no redeeming flavor.  Sanka anyone?

The upside is that the Baristas were very friendly, and they were playing cool music.  So a star for that."}
{"text":"Maintaining my 4-star rating for the reasons I've already listed, but be advised that the food is extremely unimpressive."}
{"text":"I love coming here to work. Great atmosphere and artwork. They have amazing tea and do a great job with the steeping process and bring a mug and a refill out to you at your table. Their snacks are also delicious."}
{"text":"I dig this joint. They feature the Chemex brewing method, which is rad. Plus Intelligentsia beans can't be beat. They're a scosh light on the seating, and outlets can be hard to come by. But you don't get this hip by emulating Starbucks. The baristas are all super friendly, and they even know what they're doing! What a revelation! In a college town, the fact that so many craptastic cafes with terrible baristas exist is beyond my comprehension; but JPH nails it. 

And one last thing, what good would a coffeehouse be without internet? These cats have the most reliable internet on the Madison coffee scene. Hands down. Best internet. There's nothing I hate more than rolling up on a coffeeshop only to be greeted by an internet connection thats up and down more times than... you fill in whichever metaphor your mind desires... I mean, this isn't 1997, folks. We aren't on \"Friends\". People don't go to coffeeshops to read \"People\" and gossip with each other. We're there to stare at our individual glowing screens and gossip *about* each other in silence."}
{"text":"Good brunch food, good coffee, lots of awesome art on the walls. Had the best chai ever here, and it's had me coming back over and over"}
{"text":"Good food, atmosphere and neighborhood gatherings.  Coffee is expensive. Love the Story Slam!"}
{"text":"Awesome coffee, indeed. This place seemed way too high brow for me the first time I went. I didn't know each cup was a pour over (should have read the Yelp reviews first), and the barista was not helpful at all. That being said, I've definitely changed my mind about the place. All of my baristas since that first time have been friendly. Some will give you their recommendation without you even having to ask if you're having trouble deciding.

Cool place to study. Not too loud at all. I wouldn't do it every night because a cup of coffee is close to $4, but I feel lucky I live so close to JPH."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday morning with my boyfriend and there was no wait and plenty of seating.  We each got breakfast sandwiches and both were delicious.  They also came with a side of either salad or chips-- I would definitely recommend the salad!"}
{"text":"Among the two best coffee shops in Madison (the other one is Bradbury's). Superb quality drinks. Gwen and Kyle (and the whole crew) are great. Limited food menu but good sandwiches and breakfast offerings. Low key; lots of people work there."}
{"text":"If you think you can make a better peanut butter and jelly sandwich at home, chances are you might be wrong. 

I found JPH the day after my boyfriend moved to Madison, and have loved it ever since. Introduced me to Intelligentsia coffee. First day there two of the baristas approaches us with our coffees wanting us to rate them since they have poured them in different styles. For some reason though the JPH coffee tends to be a little too acidic for me. 

The highlight really is their food. Any sandwich that you can get there is a miracle. I don't know how they do it. I'm a sucker for the peanut butter & jelly, but their breakfast and tuna are also a favorite. When I used to visit on weekends at first I'd go work at JPH.  But I find it a little uncomfortable with the awkward chairs and tables. Also they have a nice selection of beers if you are working there late and need something to calm you down ;)"}
{"text":"JPH does serve some amazing coffee and it's worth stopping in. However, be prepared to get coffee to go because of lack of seating. On weekends the place is packed and just about everyone has a laptop and takes up a lot of space. I visited yesterday morning and had to sit in a chair in the corner as the other 4 in my group were able to find seating at the end of a long table. My coffee was served in a to-go cup because they didn't have any more clean cups available. They also did not have any cups by the water the entire hour we were there. The place also could use some organization and a good clean. The corner we were in had boxes of beer that weren't placed in storage and were just sitting on the floor. There were food splatters on the wall near the garbage containers. The other times I have visited were much more pleasant so I'm surprised how disappointing this last visit was. My coffee was delicious, the other members in my group commented that their ham sandwich was \"ok\" and their latte was \"kinda cold\". I highly recommend trying their coffee, just maybe get it to go..."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop with a lot of selections and a super hipster vibe. My favorite thing is definitely the breakfast sandwich with egg, ham, tomato, pesto, and fresh mozzarella. TO. DIE. FOR. I've never had a better sandwich! I've gotten it pretty much every time I've gone.

This was also where I was introduced to the Chemex (I'm not much of a coffee snob, obviously). It's also where I bought my Chemex, which is all I do for coffee at home now.

As far as the atmosphere, I feel alright with labeling it janky. The chairs are old and some of the metal ones kind of feel like they're going to fall apart beneath you. It's kind of cramped quarters, especially if you are unfortunate enough to be in there during the peak hours. But it's a great place to go if you want to study. Even better if you're just up for good ol fashioned people watching."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing coffee, friendly baristas. New favorite coffee spot-would be perfect if they were open later."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich No. 2 is to die for & the coffee is great.  Just know that the egg on the sandwich is not hard & it can get a bit messy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I like to try new places for breakfast. We are fifty somethings looking for good food, good experience and positive vibes. We apparently just don't fit in here. We ordered the breakfast bowl 2 eggs sunny side up(I should have asked for scrambled),on potatoes with one piece of toast. This was a delicious meal for my hubby-he ate all 4 eggs  and potatoes with toast. I did enjoy the toast and potatoes. They were well made and hot. I would like to have had jam-could not find any. So I give the food a 5 star-just because I ordered wrong doesn't mean it was bad. 
However, the atmosphere, the waiting, the tenseness was just too much for me. I ordered an iced tea, small glass-no sweetener to be found except sugar. Meh-not great. 
You can tell that I am used to delicious food, served with a smile and in a reasonable amount of time. If that is what you are looking for-stay away.
If you want an awesome coffee experience done with seriousness, preciseness and have time to wait-this is the place for you. Good luck Johnson Public House, I am just not in your demographics."}
{"text":"I'm actually here right now writing this. I really like how bright and airy it is in here -- makes it much easier to get work done. My one complaint is that the drinks are actually pretty pricey. A large iced coffee (16 oz) is $3.70. I was actually really surprised by that price (no prices listed on the menu for iced drinks). It is really good though so I'd probably get it again. This place is definitely an upgrade from Company of Thieves."}
{"text":"Two stars because they generally have pretty damn good coffee, and they're a coffee shop, so it should be expected. The selection seems to change regularly (I've seen Stumptown, Ruby, Kickapoo and they're own KinKin brand, among others), but always seems to be great. So the coffee = good. 

Here are my gripes:

1) The service is always slow. Not slow because they're really busy, or slow because that's just how long it takes to make really good coffee, but lazy slow. I've been in there and waited 20 minutes for a cappuccino with no drinks in front of me because they barista was on his phone on the wrong side of the counter for the first 15 of those minutes. 

2) The seating is weird. The table in the back seems to be too big for the space, and it takes some tricky maneuvering to get around people already seated there. 

So my advice is definitely go if you want good coffee. Get it to go and don't expect it to be quick, but know that you'll have a good coffee."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood coffee house! 
I love the atmosphere of this place, especially on weekend mornings. They make the best chai latte I've ever tasted and do the fun steamed milk designs too!
Try the chocolate sandwich with strawberries -- to die for."}
{"text":"The morning is not complete without a cuppa. Soaking in the hipster vibe in the neighborhood with a latte and cappuccino, with an absolutely chill recording playing in the background and rays of sun beaming in through the windows. Perfect start to a Saturday morning!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place out a few times since moving around the corner and honestly it's always just vaguely disappointing. The coffee is great, the food is usually great (though one time i got an absolutely tiny order of Brady pudding, which is ridiculous because it's 7 dollars) but the service is terribly slow. I've never gone in and been able to get food in less than 20 minutes. They've forgotten twice, and each time they kinda laugh it off. The staff is a little /too/ chill for me, they seem like they're more used to chatting than doing work."}
{"text":"This might sound a bit weird, but this place seemed like a notably honest institution...What I mean is their coffee menu is explicit and up-to-date, always in flux. Unlike almost every other cafe I've been to or worked at that tries to cut the subtle corner when answering the question of how to serve/cook eggs, they just straight up poach them all. There's no cutting corners here, which may be why some of the more negative reviews here talk about long waits for drinks etc. Quality comes from time and care, and I respect this place immensely for putting just that into the increasingly speed-driven consumer marketplace.

The coffee's great, but that doesn't really matter. What matters is that its an extremely caring institution."}
{"text":"I like what they are trying to do - but I think there are a couple flaws.

First, everything is fairly expensive for Madison. Coffee is around $4 per cup, pastries seem expensive, and coffee beans per lb. are pricey.

Second, it seems just a bit too pretentious. My roommate asked for a coffee (she's not picky) and they said \"Well, we just don't have coffee here... we make every cup to order\" in a fairly snooty tone. And they weigh the water.... This isn't Blue Bottle.

But - the positives are that I think it's a cool space with good decor and the coffee is pretty good (albeit expensive). I'll come back."}
{"text":"I came here FOUR times during a 3-day stay in Madison. The first two was while I was working-from-home. This place is awesome to plug in, work away at a table, and enjoy a great variety of coffee. The other two times, I brought people who wanted good coffee, and this place delivered. Awesome atmosphere. Awesome awesome awesome."}
{"text":"Great place to spend a few hours relaxing or doing work. The coffee is tasty but a little pricey. I haven't tried the food. 

I really like the ambiance - it seems like one of my friend's eclectic living rooms. Lots of strange animal art on the walls, and mismatched furniture. It's an all around relaxing setting, and there's plenty of space. It's a great neighborhood coffee shop!"}
{"text":"Impressive coffee house in this smallish city. Just trendy enough to feel fancy, yet still comfortable to stay the whole afternoon. Attention to detail--- this place could go toe-to-toe with most places in Portland or Seattle. If you're into coffee and find yourself in Madison, make a trip to this place."}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly group of baristas and roasters.  The food is delicious.  The coffee - best around.  Never have had a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Was in the Madison area for business. On the way to the airport, I stopped in at Johnson Public House. Okay, now they were impressive, even though they didn't roast. They had coffee that day from Intelligentsia (only thing they had on sale and since that's close, didn't buy), Madcap and Kickapoo. I prefer African to South American so had the one from Madcap (My apologies for not taking a picture so that I remembered what I had, I was tired and so ready to go home.) Anywho, they knew what they sold and how to make it and if I had had time, I would have tried more."}
{"text":"Got a sandwich the a week ago on my way out of town.  It was pretty darn good, good ingredients, and came with a pretty good leafy-greens salad thing on the side.  Would go again definitely."}
{"text":"Went to JPH for the first time last week. I was meeting some friends for dinner at Salvatore's Tomato Pies (which is right next door) and was in the area a little early. I decided to check out JPH and sit and read for a bit before dinner. My first impression of the place turned out be wrong but I can understand how some people wouldn't necessarily enjoy the ambiance. At first glance the chairs don't look too comfy and there is some rather odd art on the wall but the longer I sat there, the more I liked it. The staff is extremely friendly and the music eclectic (everything from instrumentals to funk to The Killers to Phoenix and lots of stuff I didn't recognize but still enjoyed). 

They offer a wide range of teas and serve Intelligensia coffee which was a delightful surprise for this Chicago transplant. (Side note, if you've never had Intelligensia you must give it a try!). I love coffee shops that offer the pour over preparation and JPH is one of those places. They take credit cards but there is a sign saying cash preferred. I didn't eat but saw some yummy looking sandwiches pass my way. Place was packed at 4:30 on a Thursday. A decent mix of students on non-students alike. I didn't use the WIFI so can't speak to its reliability.

I ordered my hot cocoa and settled into read. Seemed like quite some time had passed and I still didn't have my hot cocoa. Then I noticed the barista surfing the net or something on the iPad which doubles as a credit card reader when you pay. When I got up and asked for my drink she apologized and said she had forgotten. I initially was kinda bummed out but this was completely redeemed upon delivery of my drink which was accompanied by yet another apology as well as a token worth $5 for my next visit. I don't live nearby but will be sure to drop in next time I'm on that side of town (and not just because of the token!)."}
{"text":"Very disappointed we went there to eat and there was no were to seat... Every table had a computer on it and no one was eating! Is this a library or a cafe? Food is very good but they should limit how many tables are for people to seat there using free wifi! You are losing money and customers."}
{"text":"Very good re-creation of this cafe/storefront. Great for writing a paper. Love the idea of being able to sit and drink coffee for a couple hours, and when it gets into the evening being able to switch over to beer. 

Sandwiches are in the range of good-for-a-cafe. The roast beef sandwich is always very close to good, but usually has too many onions and not quite enough meat for the price. The tuna melt is very good, and has a strong lemon note that's just delightful. Coffee is quite expensive but always on the syrupy side (a high complement) and never bitter. They do great coffee here, and you'll pay to enjoy it.

My one complaint is that this place gets packed around the bar with local hipsters who try to turn the JPH into a catwalk. I come here to work or meet colleagues; being crowded and then scrutinized isn't on my list. On the flip side of this same observation it's a testament to the able owners and staff that locals feel comfortable and casual here, and continue to return.

Another few years and this will be known as a \"must-visit\" Madison location.

One last point: for the love of god stop playing Mumford and Sons and Kings of Leon on repeat. Hire a curator to pick out some good jazz, classical, and independent music."}
{"text":"Basic hipster coffee shop. Great coffee, overpriced food, good ambiance. Great for getting some work done."}
{"text":"I really appreciate good coffee and I don't mind paying for a superior cup. The coffee at JPH is good, but I'm always surprised at how expensive it is for what you get. It's one of the few coffee shops where no matter what you get, you're paying more than you should."}
{"text":"This is a great coffee shop in Madison. Plenty of seating inside (it was a Sunday) and such a variety of coffee. 

I stopped in briefly for a sandwich. I ordered the portobello and fell in love. Perfect portion sizes and fairly inexpensive. They make them fresh, which means it'll take a little longer to make that sandwich into a panini. Ginger plum tea was refreshing. Kind of like Kool-aid without the sugar. Delicious.

The staff is super friendly and take pride in their craft. Oh, and those groovy tunes. I dig those groovy tunes. If I lived in Madison, I would definitely make this a regular place."}
{"text":"When you combine excellent music with great conversation, a superb roast beef breakfast sandwich, and a double shot espresso, cubano style - you get a 5 star experience.

I haunted JPH with a good friend the other morning, and spent two hours sipping espresso, trying my friend's excellent Rwandan coffee (black because it's just that smooth, no bitterness at all to need masking),  and appreciating the busy atmosphere.  I like bustling.  I adore the community vibe this place has got going on. I have a crush, it's true - and it's for Johnson Public House. 

I never am someone who considers herself an expert in anything, so when I asked the guy behind the counter to help me out with my coffee selection, he was all about it.  He made some great recommendations and played a role in my being smitten with this cafe.  From the outside it looks like a hole in the wall, some dusty relic with no relevance - but you step inside and the world opens to you.  

And that caffeine!  Truly the best I have had the pleasure of sipping.  And it should be, it doesn't come cheap - my friends.  I would have returned for the food alone, everything else is just icing."}
{"text":"This place is in my neighborhood. They produce amazing vanilla lattes. They are a bit too pricey for me to go all the time, but it is a treat when I can go. Only 4 stars because the service can be slow."}
{"text":"JPH, I love you but for the love of god, PLEASE think about installing a ventilation system in your kitchen area. Everytime I'm in there, if even for just a grab and go, I end up smelling like I worked in a greasy kitchen all day and if there for more than 20 minutes, my eyes are burning. Not pleasant, I've had to change clothes and air out my jacket after a visit. I'm starting to think twice about where to get my coffee, unfortunately. 
Also, wouldn't hurt to change up the menu every now and then..eh?"}
{"text":"I would say they got the Slow Coffee movement going on. No cheap coffee sitting in airpots for an hour or more.

French press, chemex, V60, lattes, cortado(my favorite),.....all worth the price.

Free wifi, chill baristas, laid back mellow music in the background, and can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches. Also can't forget the great selection of beers in the cooler. See that more and more in cafes."}
{"text":"Amazing vanilla lattes and yummy brunch! My favorite coffee shop in Madison! Always friendly and prompt service."}
{"text":"Coffee was good, though extremely slow to be made.  Cinnamon(?) roll was really good.  Service was friendly.  The only real issue was hot coffee being served in a mason jar.  Not a mason mug with a handle - a mason jar.  One of the dumber things I've seen and I've seen plenty."}
{"text":"Great coffee, friendly staff, nice atmosphere. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is the wifi here is absolutely abysmal. Incredibly slow for even basic internet surfing, forget about anything else. I see many people in here on laptops and I just don't understand how they're possibly using the internet. I wish JPH would do something about their TERRIBLE wifi."}
{"text":"They make the 4-hour trip from Champaign always end happily. Amazing coffee, food, and people!"}
{"text":"I love the Johnson Public House. You will pay more than normal for your coffee but it will be the best cup of coffee you've ever had. They are constantly rotating what they serve but it's always amazing. The atmosphere is great as well. It feels comfortable like your college friends apartment. They have huge tables that are fun to spread out on or make a friend and share with. Definitely a relaxed feeling."}
{"text":"The name: Johnson Public House. I picture some sort of meat-packing/butcher, gritty brick building. But I appreciate the beauty of the abbreviation, JPH, which matches the easy-going use of mismatched chairs, light colors, and tasteful pillow portraits. The extensive array of teas and coffees, that which far outnumbered the food items, were fun to look through and order. 

I met a bunch of friends for Sunday brunch at JPH. I was worried about how busy it'd be since it was a Sunday after a Badger football game, but the steady stream of regulars created a very comfortable atmosphere. Family-friendly, great space, solid preparation of food, and hot teas and slow drip coffee. 

The Sunday brunch sandwich was simple but delicious. The eggs, tomato, and hint of maple syrup was very tasty. I also enjoyed a latte and a ginger tangerine tea that had a nice kick. The personal tea canter was unexpected, keeping hot tea handy. 

JPH is a touch of hipster, young family, and old friends gathering to play checkers. Really low-key atmosphere, happy and helpful staff, and reasonable prices for good food and drink."}
{"text":"The vibe is low key, more cafe/coffeehouse than public house. 

Spotted with mismatched chairs and tables, pop(ish) art clipped creatively to the walls, you order and pay at the counter and find a seat. Very casual, very college.

 (-) Let me just say that I am not a fan of the Ipad POS system. I'm immediately given the option to tip 15%, 20%, 25%, or nothing. Normally in an order-at-the-counter-and-seat-yourself situation where I don't have an actual sever, I'd tip a dollar or so but I ended up tipping 15% before I had even seen my drinks. 

(+) Coffee and tea selections are good (Intelligentsia) and they offer about ten sandwiches. The barista was very helpful in suggesting a roast for my very basic coffee drinking boyfriend. Our sandwiches came out before our drinks and I reminded the barista who dropped them off of our orders. He said they'd be right out. 

(-) Second mini-rant, this place needs order/table numbers. Walking out of the kitchen and \"auctioning\" off food is not complimenting the laid-back vibe. It looks inefficient and chaotic and I'm pretty sure people are ending up with the wrong beverages. Unfortunately, we finished our meals before our coffee and tea had even arrived and when I went to request that they be made to go I watched the staff realize the ticket had been thrown out with our food order. 

(-/+) The barista was apologetic but sorry should be an action not a statement, especially in service industries and I would have liked to have been refunded for the drinks. After all, we waited over 25 minutes for a coffee and tea. 

(+) Oh yeah, and the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Hard to tell what's better between the people and the coffee. Huge props to the Johnsons for running an awesome neighborhood spot with the best coffees (counter culture, intelligensia, ceremony, etc.) and teas on the planet. Not to mention the place has charm through the roof. Five stars!"}
{"text":"Upon entering, you are greeted by a hodgepodge of mix and matched tables and chairs.  Sitting in these chairs are even a bigger mishmash of people-hipsters, wanna-be's, students, young professionals, even someone wearing MC Hammer pants and telling her friends they sell also a \"male\" version.  It just seems to all work as JPH is \"2 Legit to Quit\"
They serve usually 3-4 choices of beans from Intelligentsia accompanied by 3 different brewing options.  Never would have I imagined that I would engage in a conversation about what brewing method (pour over vs. chemex) would be most appropriate for the roast I selected, but I did and have no regret as the resulting coffee was incredible.  
Yes, the prices are higher than other places but the quality and attention to detail that come with it makes it worth every penny.  Check it out, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Lately when I daydream about coffee it's all about what I've had at JPH. They expertly brew everything and the beans come from many different roasters, which I really like! Opportunities abound for busting out of your usual coffee rut.
I also really love the vibe here: people have their laptops out and folks are studying but it's not one of those places where you and your chatty friends are going to get shushed by some loser preparing for a midterm. I'd say JPH has third wave coffee without the third wave sterility."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick breakfast and great coffee and had heard good things about this place when I stopped on my way home from downtown. They serve pour over coffee, a couple pastries and then sandwiches. 

The place is clean and bright, staff friendly and the food came out within 6 minutes of ordering it. I ordered a triple almond milk (they have all kinds of milk!) Latte. I was told that they could only do espresso in 2 shot increments because of their machine (so, make it a quadruple latte!). My mom and i decided to spilt a breakfast sandwich and a side salad. All of their breakfast sandwiches had ham on them which we were avoiding (mom doesn't like it) and the barista offered their veggie sandwich to us which want on the menu. So we ordered that. It turned out to be pesto, mozzarella, tomato and egg on multigrain toast. It was fabulous! And big, which meant sharing was easy and satisfying. The sandwich even cane spilt for us on two different plates! 

Lots of people were ordering the granola (essentially a yogurt parfait) that looked good. But I was super happy with the egg sandwich. I would definitely go there again!

Other random thoughts, street parking was abundant, it was a little busy, Wi-Fi is free!"}
{"text":"This place has great chai, coffee and lattes. The food is fine, but it takes a half a year to be made. Stick with drinks"}
{"text":"I came to have brunch with a couple of friends. Be aware that seating is limited, especially in the winter because it's too cold and the outdoor seating is gone. 

Wifi = Solid. It looks like a lot of people come here to work on stuff and enjoy a nice brew. 

Food: get the granola. The yogurt is covered in honey and fresh blueberries and strawberries. The pastry I had this time was a vanilla swirl. It was not too sweet and a perfect amount of soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. 

Brews: I got a mocha with almond milk. It was the perfect amount of chocolate and the almond milk was heated at the right temp. Be aware it's an extra $0.50 for soy or almond milk. :) they have a variety of hot teas to choose from and it seemed popular when I was there. I'll have to try it out next time. 

Order up front and you get a number. It's a great place to meet up with friends but don't take too much time because of the limited seating."}
{"text":"I agree with most of the other posters that the new owners did an amazing job renovating and redecorating the place, and the beer and wine selection is a great addition.

However, I have had to all but stop going to Johnson Public House because their prices are ridiculous! You can't get a 16 oz. regular coffee for less than $4.10.  (I believe a 12 oz. cup, which is a small at most places, costs $3.80).  I'm sure the coffee is better quality, but I used to be a regular patron of In the Company of Thieves (5-6 times a week) and I honestly can't afford to go to JPH now. There are so many grad students in the neighborhood too, and I imagine price actually is an issue for a lot of the (at least former) customer base. I honestly don't know any other place in Madison that charges that much.

I feel bad because the owners do seem really nice and have done great work with the place, but I have had to take my (very regular) business elsewhere."}
{"text":"JPH has a most-excellent set of picnic tables out front that I highly recommend you make use of this summer. Inside you'll find a bright seating area and a hodgepodge of furniture and decorations. It reminds me of going to a 22-year-old's apartment - everything's a little worn in and walks the border of eclectic & schizophrenic, but the kid's learned to clean up after herself and make you a good drink when you drop by. 

I opted for the lemonade on my sunny afternoon visit and had a good blend of sweet and tart. The service could have been a bit friendlier (the counterperson was pretty mute and just laid the iPad they use for cards down on the counter sideways without saying \"you can tip and sign here\"), but I got my drink quickly and accurately so it's fine. 

The Wi-Fi password is posted on the front of the register (I missed it when I initially walked up to order), and I'm happy to report it's strong enough to reach their picnic tables outside. Definitely going to keep it on the list for sunny work spots."}
{"text":"The best coffeehouse in Madison and secretly the best brunch spot.

Seating: Limited, but there are outdoor community tables so be ready to make new friends. People will stay to work on their laptop for a sizable amount of time, so you've been warned. 

Menu: Full espresso bar, (the best dry cappuccino I have had in Madison to-date), alcohol, breakfast sandwiches, baked goods, etc. I highly recommend the Sunday Morning Breakfast Sandwich and the bread pudding. 

Ambiance: Local art on the walls (sometimes of the baristas themselves), old arcade game in the corner; at the risk of sounding like an out of touch grandma, here is where the trendy kids of Madison unite. They also frequently hold community events.

JPH single-handedly revitalized East Johnson Street and continues to uplift the local businesses that have grown around them. All praise is beyond deserved. Check them out."}
{"text":"Johnson Public House (JPK...if you're cool) delivers a great coffee (Joe if you're manly) experience.  Full of hipsters and strung out college students, you can get one of a vast array of different blends of Joe as well as preparations (btw, French press is your friend).  Wi-fi ensures that as you sip, you will be engrossed in your work/play/whatever.  Decor is old and dated, but maybe that is the allure for the crowd.  Food is very good, with a limited menu...the breakfast sandwich had some nice twists and the granola with fresh fruit and yogurt one of the best out there.

So, get your hip (also known as cool) on at JPK.  Bring your iPad/laptop/abacus and leave your inner jock (stud, athlete) at home.  Now if only I could get a pair of skinny jeans to fit."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday after work and ordered a cappuccino.  The flavor was good and not too strong and of course the art was pretty.  My friend ordered a chai latte which was also really good.  There was no problem for us finding a spot to sit, but I could see how it could be difficult on weekends if they get busy."}
{"text":"Great place and amazing team of baristas. They're kin kin coffee tastes out of this world. I've gone here a number of times and this is the perfect place to grab a nice cup of joe or a good beer and read a book, meet with friends."}
{"text":"PROS: Great tea selection, good coffee, nice staff
CONS: ?

I love tea and JPH has a lot of excellent, non-standard teas. The staff is friendly and attentive to the brewing process, so the tea always tastes excellent. The atmosphere is relaxing, with lots of seating for students to study. My favorite coffee/tea spot in town."}
{"text":"I took my wife out of our way here to experience an amazing cup of meticulously prepared coffee. We each ordered the same thing and went outside to wait....and wait....and wait! It took 30 minutes for our $13 worth of coffee to arrive. When it did, mine was overflowing and slipped all over the saucer. The server said \"I can bring you another?\" in a tone that said \" you don't really want to wait for a new one do you?\" A napkin would have been a nice compromise. Overall a disappointment due to the excessive wait."}
{"text":"Iced coffee in a mason jar ...love it!"}
{"text":"Easily the best coffee in town because it's Kin Kin and because the baristas actually know what they're doing!!!

Lots of natural light and a variety of seating make JPH a must for us when we roll into Madison."}
{"text":"When I was going through caffeine-withdrawal my first night in Madison, Johnson Public House came to my rescue!

I had an Americano made with the Ethiopian beans, and it was incredible - Great crema, and very fruity. I typically drink my espressos and coffees black anyway, but this cup especially deserved to be enjoyed completely unadulterated.

The atmosphere in there is also great. Cool art and music."}
{"text":"If you had asked me to design my the ideal business to take over this spot, I would have come up with the JPH.  As a neighbor, I can't tell you how happy I am that they have finally arrived.  And if the business they have been doing in this past month is any indication, I'm not alone.  I almost don't want to write this Yelp review because I don't want it to get any more crowded!

The Public House is warm and comfortable -- has a great vibe for doing homework or sharing sandwiches.  I haven't had a chance to check out the beer selection, but I imagine that this summer the space will turn into somewhere I want to have a drink and catch up with friends.

It's true the coffee takes longer than Starbucks, but that's because they brew each cup to order.  Seriously.  I didn't even know that was possible.  And the barristas (and the owners, who are often behind the country) are more than happy to fill you in on the process and why it makes the coffee taste so good.

(Plus, they put surge protectors into their electrical outlets so now more people can plug in their laptops.)"}
{"text":"Such a rare find in Madison! And to think that it was totally by chance that my friend and I even discovered this little gem on the East side.

We were in the neighborhood because we wanted to try Sophia's bakery for brunch. Unfortunately, Sophia's was closed for the day, so we begrudgingly headed back to the only open restaurant/cafe within walking distance: JPH. As soon as we caught a whiff of the freshly brewed coffee and took a glance at the menu, our frowns turned upside down. It was instantaneous. Magical even. 

I got a flat white latte and a sunday breakfast sandwich (egg, cheese, ham, & a touch of maple syrup)... who would have thought that combination could taste so good. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  I also love how they brew each cup of coffee to order. The baristas have truly mastered the art of coffee making! 

They take a while to prepare the food, but it is definitely worth the wait. There's also plenty of interesting art/furniture around the cafe to keep you busy as you wait. (:

Patrons of JPH are very low key, and the establishment has a hippy-esque/laid-back feel (sans homeless people) that makes me nostalgic for the Berkeley coffee shops (yay cafe Med/Milano/Strada) that I used to frequent. 

If I go missing on a Sunday morning....I'm probably holed up at JPH with my laptop and a steaming cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"Considering I'm a barista but at a different coffee shop in town, I feel like I compare every coffee shop to where I work. This coffee shop, however, doesn't fit a comparison properly because it's in its own category of coffee shops. Quaint, simply-decorated, and with limited specialty drinks, I dig this spot for especially focused studying. The single room is well lit, the coffee smells great, it's fairly quiet (unless they play badass 90's pop like they did today, which I'm totally okay with), and the baristas are nice! 
I had a cortado, their iced Crimson tea, and the breakfast bowl during my 6-hour stay. Everything was nearly fairly priced, and tasty! I do wish the breakfast bowl was bigger for $7, but I liked the portions of the drinks. I'm glad I found this spot for my less-social coffee fixes."}
{"text":"Great place, lots of character! I even bought a bag of coffee that I ended up needing to return (long story) but they were awesome and very understanding. Their chai is also amazing.  They truly know their stuff about java!"}
{"text":"Everyone working here knows what they are doing and actually cares about it. This is evident in the product that they produce. I've never had anything less than excellent coffee from here.

They also have beer and wine for the evening (or afternoon, they won't judge) crowd, which is great because there aren't many options for beer joints in this neighborhood, even if they're only open until 8:00.

As at least one other yelper has said: don't be in a hurry. Enjoy the place. Ask questions, get to know someone. The regular crowd here is awesome. 

If you must be in a hurry, ask for a cup from the air pot, it's usually ready right now and costs a little less if that's a concern."}
{"text":"Good range of coffees and methods, but I was very disappointed with the end result. My V60 Kenya was tepid and underextracted. I don't mean not scalding -- I mean no heat whatever. Won't return."}
{"text":"Good food, nice mood, but way overpriced. To have to pay 2.25 for refill of house coffee after just spending 10.00 for breakfast is silly. Time to get real."}
{"text":"Still a solid 5, but wish I could add a few more stars for standout service today!

1. They were out of cold brew and typically (I think) don't keep much ice around, so after taking my order the lovely gent ran down the street to grab a bag in order to get their normal pour over method going with ice down below. He strained the ice out and poured the cooled at this point brew into a cup with new ice. It rawked. I want more. 

2. Took with me a sammie to go and grabbed greens along side. This is so dorky but check it out: Greens were nicely placed in a recyclable cup w/ lid and the dressing was resting on top in it's own condiment cup. I dressed that puppy, capped it, shook, and boom, it was a little like being there minus the hip vibe and melting pot, no cornucopia of passerbys."}
{"text":"Since my last review was over six months ago, and I've probably been averaging 4x/week here up until my departure from Madison a month ago, I thought it would be prudent of me to write an updated review of JPH.  

Yes, my opinion of JPH has changed a bit.  It's even more awesome than I thought it was back in February.  Why the change?  I've had the privilege of finally trying some of their sandwiches.  Like their brews, the sandwiches never disappointed.  The green eggs and ham breakfast sandwich is probably my favorite.  While most places would used a fried egg, JPH incorporates a hard-boiled egg in its breakfast sandwich, and it works all too well.  With the egg, ham, pesto, grilled onions stuffed in between Batch Bakehouse bread and grilled in a panini press, what's not to like?  But what I still appreciate JPH for the most is their preparation of their coffee.  Intelligentsia Venice used to be my second home.  I've had some great cups of coffee there, but I can honestly say that Kyle and company do Intelligentsia better than Intelligentsia does itself! The same can be said about Handsome, another guest roaster that often makes appearances on JPH's guest roaster lineup.  

For myself, a guy who's had caffeine intoxication every day since I arrived in Seattle a month ago (too many good roasters here), I still can say that I have a preference for Kyle and JPH's drinks over just about everything I've had in Seattle and Vancouver.  

Also can't say this enough.  Kyle and his crew are some of the coolest people around!"}
{"text":"Best lattes in town! Had an almond milk latte with pacific milk and it was superb. Very friendly staff, open relaxed space. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"You go to a coffeehouse for one thing:  great coffee.  This place does not disappoint.  My wife ordered a flat white with an ethiopia/Columbia blend.  She said it was far and away the best one in town.  I had a pour over decaf which had great body to it.

The actual ambiance creates a sense of impoverishment.  I would classify the furniture as neo-goodwill.  The walls need a good paint layer and the floor needs restaining.  It is quaint from that standpoint and it does seem to fit the neighborhood where you have some delapidated student housing.  

We did not have any food, so I cannot comment on the quality.  So, bottom line, have the coffee and don't be put off by the appearance."}
{"text":"Cozy environment, coffee and tea made to order. Semi-friendly staff (sometimes they can be aloof or have a \"too cool for you\" attitude). 

Great tea selection and delicious coffee drinks. A bit on the pricier side, but you pay for quality. Haven't tried the food, but heard it's good."}
{"text":"Best cafe in Madison. They use Inteligencia coffee, offer pour-overs, serve Rishi tea, and have a great environment in which to do homework."}
{"text":"As the former owner of \"In the Company of Thieves\", I can tell you first hand that I did not put very much effort or passion into the business for the last 2 years of ownership.  Without giving personal detail's  I would like to express my regret in acting so poorly.  Many of the negative reviews will forever remind me of that regret.

Moving forward, the best decision I made was to sell the shop to Gwen and Kyle Johnson.  They are doing a fantastic job with Johnson Public House.  The ambiance is inviting and the Barista's are all very friendly and well trained in the art.  The food menu is limited, but all very well prepared, and anyone that would expect a larger menu in such a place really doesn't understand the space and limitations that JPH is working with.

They upgraded some permits to allow the cooking of eggs on premises.  When I owned Thieves I had to order eggs precooked for my breakfast sandwiches, which coming from a culinary background is downright embarrassing. 


I was skeptical at first with Intelligentsia being their sole coffee roaster, as I am a Kickapoo loyal, but I've been pleasantly surprised with the quality and consistency.  Again, it helps that the barista's are very well trained.  Along with excellent espresso drinks, they also specialize in pour overs, and individual french presses, which are right up my alley.     

The beer and wine license they added is a huge plus to the Johnson st. hood, as don't really have too many other options to mellow out with a cold one, let alone a place with free WI-FI.

All this new stuff is great, but by far the most important addition is their passion.  Unlike myself, Gwen and Kyle are in it for the long haul.  They are friendly, down to earth business owners, and a great big breath of fresh air for the Johnson street neighborhood.

I wish them the best of luck, although I'm pretty sure they won't need it."}
{"text":"This is a great coffee shop with a relaxing but not sleepy atmosphere. I enjoy the art on the walls and the music selection. I recommend the yogurt and granola and especially the chai latte. Of course any coffee drink will be great as well. The price is well worth it because all drinks and menu items are made with precision and with premium ingredients. The baristas are friendly too! This is a great place to bring your laptop and get some creative work done."}
{"text":"The place is awesome. People are always working here. Their coffee is okay but their pudding bread is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"As far as Sunday brunch goes, this place is definitely going to be within my top five spots.

Since my fiance and I actually got up early this morning, we decided to get some brunch and wanted to try a new place. I had recently seen a delicious-looking picture of Johnson Public House's granola parfait on Instagram, so I suggested we go there.

When first arriving, we knew we had arrived at a popular spot since almost every table in the place was full. Fortunately, after ordering, we found snagged a spot outside which was perfect since it was a warm autumn day.

We received our coffees immediately after ordering - his was black, mine was a mocha. The mocha had the perfect level of sweet chocolately-ness which satisfied my morning sweet tooth. It was also nicely decorated with a foamy heart-like pattern.

Shortly after, I'd say about 15 minutes later, our food arrived: the Sunday Morning and Roast Beef breakfast sandwiches with greens, granola, and toast with avocado. Since we had so much food, we kind of treated this like tapas and shared every plate. Both the Sunday Morning and Roast Beef sandwiches were oozing with cheese and a fried egg. I liked the Sunday Morning sandwich best because, again, I had a sweet tooth this morning and the maple syrup satisfied that craving. The toast and greens were great sides to get with the sandwiches and complemented them nicely. Having the granola parfait at the end was a great breakfast dessert with its combination of crunchy cashews, creamy yogurt, and fresh blueberries and blackberries.

Topping out at about $35 for two, this place was definitely reasonably priced, especially for the quality of their food. I'd definitely come here again for brunch!"}
{"text":"Best coffee in Madison! All of the French presses I've gotten have been beautiful. The Ethiopian with citrus notes is my fav. Besides that, I really REALLY dig the vibe. The art, the music. The food is minimal but very good."}
{"text":"So either JPH has changed their prices, or some people haven't been there in a while, because my coffee was like $2.50.  Nothing arbitrarily expensive there.

Somebody told me this place had \"good noms.\"  I'll be honest, I had no idea what that meant.  After going there, I still don't know what it means.  I'm just not hip enough, I guess.

Large space, good coffee, a fine place to show up and engage in tabletop RPG battles of your choice."}
{"text":"If you like overpriced hipster food served by surly staff, this is the place for you. The food wasn't bad, but it's twice as expensive as what it should be. A place with no atmosphere shouldn't be allowed to charge this much."}
{"text":"A-OK for to go service only, but I can see how this place would be more enjoyable as a hangout.

First of all, I couldn't find a menu with prices displayed, so I had to order a little blindly.  $4 for a small chai is more than any other place I've been to in Madison (this is my typical order).  At $4 for the smallest size, I would expect to have organic local college educated milk or something.

The actual chai itself was adequate, although I prefer a bit more spice. 

Since it was a pit stopped, I used the facilities.  I was amused that the bathroom used a salvaged changing table from the 80s instead of the standard \"Koala Kare\" baby changing stations you usually see.  It reminded me a bit of a basement bathroom in someone's house--randomly decorated and a bit chilly.

Now, for the outstanding part, it honestly seemed like patrons in the coffeehouse really liked being there.  You could tell that a lot of people came on a regular basis to meet with friends or get work done.  Good vibe.

tldr; I would consider coming back here with a friend, but bad choice for a pit stop."}
{"text":"JPH offers the best pour over coffee in Madison.  I look forward to visiting JPH each Saturday or Sunday for a smooth and flavorful afternoon coffee (usually V60, but Chemex is available, too).  My wife and daughter enjoy their iced mocha and iced chai.  JPH offers a nice, rotating selection of beans from roasters around the country (e.g., Intelligentsia), including their in-house brand, Kin-Kin.

I can't comment on food, as I have never ordered any.  I come for the coffee."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and am checking out all the available third wave shops here. I'm glad they serve well roasted coffees (four barrel, madcap, intelligentsia) and that they also pay homage to Handsome Coffee Roasters (RIP). However, as a barista too, the pour overs are a bit underextracted--probably due to what I assume to be a rushed pour and short brew time. The espresso was pretty good though. I was content with that! 

All that said, it is still probably one of the better places for coffee around town."}
{"text":"So my initial review on this place was in 2011 with five stars. Now, I just don't feel like it warrants that. I love love love their coffee but it takes FOREVER!! Ten minutes for two coffeest that cost over 10 bucks is toooo much. I don't make the point to go here but I will if I am feeling really rich and in the neighborhood. I feel like things should be improving two years in and they just aren't. Mostly, I just got a crappier attitude the last time I went in. I think they need to get more organized and get some training in. When the place is full and people are waiting, having the guy making your coffee lean on his arm on the counter while he does your coffee is offensive. Why on earth if you have timers and scales can't one barista be making at least three cups of pour-over coffee at the same time? Time to tighten ship, JPH!"}
{"text":"Very glad I made the effort to walk a little further to study here. Coffee was strong, food was delicious, and atmosphere was peaceful. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by to fill my thermos on the road.  A nice surprise: they serve Intelligentsia coffee and seem enthusiastic and knowledgeable. They seem to be able to deal with your choice of trendy gadgets: Chemex, vacuum, or pour-over, and they apparently have some bulk brewing method which they feed with a locally-roasted variety that I didn't recognize.  I'm sure it's good, based on their attitudes, though.  It looked like a great place to spend a few hours reading and drinking coffee.  Hope I'll get back sometime."}
{"text":"Stopped into the Public House for a bit while waiting for pizza next door, and was pleasantly surprised.  Completely chill coffee shop, great aromas, and well picked beer selection from the cooler.

It's a bit sparse inside and the tables have you sitting awkwardly far apart if you're not by yourself, but otherwise the accommodations are quite comfortable and I could see this being a nice spot to get work done or just hang for a few hours on the laptop.

The coffee looked and smelled delicious, and had it not been 8pm when I was there I would have absolutely indulged.  There will be a return visit without a doubt to sample.

We were greeted when we came in and the staff was very polite overall.  This is a much more solid choice then many other coffee places if you just want to relax and not deal with a corporate or rushed atmosphere"}
{"text":"\"Sunday morning rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin
And clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in\"

Rain in this case can more accurately be measured in terms of Sunday Morning Breakfast Sandwiches....Oh Johnson Public, how you fit the mold that I am in. 

Meld together hard-boiled egg, cheddar & ham between hearty slices of country-wheat bread that's treated with just a touch of maple syrup to devise an ingeniously crisp, subtle sweetness on par with the deliciously sweet sound of Adam Levine's voice.

Add to the mix a steaming cuppa green tea and clouds will surely shroud you in a moment unforgettable."}
{"text":"On a road trip and came through Madison for a couple of days.  Found this gem for breakfast on our way out of town.  The staff and customer service was amazing!  Firstly, we had purchased a couple drip coffees, but they ran out before our cups were completely filled and treated us to a Columbian pour over; both of which were amazing. Secondly, I ordered the breakfast sandwich with no meat and asked to sub in avocado, but I changed my mind after hearing that it was going to be an additional charge.  I recently quit my job to road trip across America for 4 months, needless to say I'm on a tight budget.  When they brought the food out to the table, which didn't take long at all, they had gone ahead and added the avocado! THANK YOU!!  The meal itself was delicious.  I had the \"regular\" breakfast sandwich with pesto, mozzarella, tomatoes, a friend egg, and thanks to the Johnson Public House saints avocado.  The cafe itself was very eclectic and filled with what seemed to be local art.  If I lived in Madison, I could definitely see myself being a regular."}
{"text":"I discovered this place this morning, and was truly delighted by the pour over coffee.  It was unique, but exceeded every expectation.

Add in that they have a good menu of both breakfast and lunch items.  You can't do better."}
{"text":"Great place to have lavender lemonade, almond lattes, and celebrate the fact that coffee shops are now places for epic skipbo battles and not hours of homework."}
{"text":"Intelligentsia coffee, good baristas, good tunes, nice atmosphere.  All around a good spot. Definitely has the feel of Intelligentsia cafes in Chicago, with a little more of a Midwestern rustic twist of some sort.  Drinks are always pretty spot on and tasty.  Can't vouch for the food, only had the coffee."}
{"text":"This place is cool! A little expensive, but worth going!!! Had a latte, hot chocolate, beers and lamb chocolate in our group! The hot coco looked boss!!!"}
