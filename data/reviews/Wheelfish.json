{"text":"The wings!!!!! Soooo good! Really cool place. The design outside and in is very unique. I normally hate being at a small bar with live music, but the singer and the guitar were the perfect level and not too loud that you couldn't have a conversation. The homemade BBQ sauces were the best! Brisket bomb. Burger bomb."}
{"text":"You would never know where Wheelfish is. The wings are very good and during tonight's Stanley cup game they're $.50. Ribs are dry rubbed and were tasty without the house sauce. I would recommend the house traditional sauce. Unfortunately my boyfriend informed me a patron left a swastika on the men's bathroom wall."}
{"text":"I stopped by Wheelfish for the first time in later November, just to check it out. I didn't know it was there until I drove past one day. My boyfriend and I had some beers at the bar and just observed the whole place. I jokingly, but also honestly, have described Wheelfish as \"Pinterest: The Bar\". The d√©cor is just so pretty, that sort of country chic. It is absolutely not a dive. It's a great little neighborhood bar where you could take your family. You can tell they are still working on the remodel/decorating process, but seeing as they've only been open for a couple months and the place already looks SO nice, I don't mind. The bartenders were very friendly and prompt. The craft beer selection is great. If you are only familiar with local favorites, such as Yuengling, you need to stop by Wheelfish and expand your palette! My only request regarding beer selection would be if they added Dogfish Head Namaste or Acacia. I'd be in there atleast once a week if they did.

Yesterday we returned, this time with my parents, to try some of the food. We all ordered the beef brisket with different sides. The portions are perfect, just enough food. You don't have to worry about not finishing it all. I find it refreshing it go to a restaurant and get served a normal amount of food, rather than a platter big enough for 2 or 3 people. 4/4 loved the brisket! The variety of barbeque sauces was great. They all definitely have their own taste but none of them are over the top, perfect for us folks who are not hardcore BBQ aficionados. I also got the mac 'n' cheese, which was delicious. It is clearly made from scratch with real cheese and crunchy bread crumbs on top. I also sampled some of my boyfriend's sweet potato fries and they were excellent. They also look to be made from scratch. They were the perfect thickness and perfectly cooked to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. No sad, floppy fries there! The ranch dip they came with was delicious. 

Wheelfish shows a ton of promise and has already thoroughly impressed me. I hope this level of quality is maintained as their popularity grows. This is going to be one of those little hidden gems in the neighborhood, which is great because we really don't have anything else like Wheelfish in the area."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place and reading reviews, we were all excited to grab some dinner and drinks here.  Maybe they were having an off night but only 1 out of the 6 of us had a good experience.

There was only one server for the whole dining area and she was clearly overwhelmed.  The two bartenders and manager weren't interested in helping her.  

Two of us got the pulled pork sandwich which was good but cold.  We didn't realize that we were supposed to have some BBQ sauce with it until after we finished and the  tables around us had the bottles.

Two got the salmon which again wasn't very warm and was served dry without any sauce at all.

One got the brisket quesidilla which literally had about two small chunks of meat on each piece so it was most tortillas with peppers.  That was sent back and exchanged for the pork nachos.  

The beef brisket was reportedly very good.

After a few rounds we asked for the bill and were told that we couldn't split a party of six, after we were told that wouldn't be a problem before the meal.  Why they couldn't ring us up as three parties of two, I do not know. Why they have large tables if they can't split them, I do not know.  Our first bill came and it was for the wrong table.  Our second bill came and the brisket quesidilla was still on it.  We finally got our correct bill which left us with the fun task of figuring out who ate and drank what.

Beer was good, place was cool, and I want to like it so maybe I'll try again in a few months."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. We enjoyed the dinner very much. The pulled pork is delicious as was the hamburger.  Loved the root beer float for dessert. Great drinks. We enjoyed music by BoJacks this evening. I suggest you try it out."}
{"text":"Invest in some wine glasses.. Not everyone is a craft beer drinker and drinking a glass of bad pinot out of what looks like a baby food jar didn't make me want to stay for another drink. The bartender had a nasty attitude and disappeared right after pouring my wine and sat in the back talking to a waitress the rest of my visit...horrible customer service skills..I was excited their was a place on my way home I could stop for a drink after work, but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Wheelfish? What a weird name. Aside from that, it's a great little place. It's my understanding that this place's previous incarnation was a longstanding and well-known local bar. When we first walked in, some of the old regulars must have been there, because they looked us up and down! Not in a bad way though. We had great service, sampled many beers and drinks. I got a drink called Heart of Darkness which, despite its name, was a lovely drink. Being a party of four, we sampled most of the meats to mixed reviews. The chicken and ribs were excellent, the pulled pork average, and the brisket was awful. It was dry and gristly, and the sauces served with our meal could not save it. The sides we ordered were very good. The mac and cheese lived up to its reputation, and the grilled veggies were nice and chunky. The fries were good. The service was excellent, and the band playing was an acoustic duo that appeared to be a house band. They were excellent and not too loud, so we could enjoy our conversation all night. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ariana took care of our group and could not have asked for better service. We had an amazing time and the food and drinks were on point. A great local that is worth checking out.

The ambiance could use a bulb or two turned off. Its a little aggressive. Lighting like a grow house."}
{"text":"The food is insane.  A super fun addition to the neighborhood. Really close to Ross Park Mall. They don't serve greasy bar food -- they sell generous portions of smoked meats, real Mac n cheese and corn bread muffins. Best salmon I've ever had. Great place to see a live band, watch a game or just hang out. Love this place."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch after doing an escape room nearby. Super nice people and very good food. Not an expansive menu, but that was a plus because everything ordered at our table was excellent. Go for the cowboy sauce - definite bite but not too hot to enjoy."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for food and music and the place was great. My husband and I ordered the brisket, quarter chicken, mac and cheese and sweet potato fries. Our friends got the ribs and salmon sammy. Everything was delicious! The mac and cheese ranks up to one of the best we have had in Pittsburgh! The brisket is not shredded but sliced and the chicken is smoked and then deep fried and it is moist and juicy. Drinks are also as equally delicious. I ordered the Paloma Fresca and it was light and refreshing. This place is a great add to the north hills. It's great to finally have a delicious BBQ joint near by that also has leonas"}
{"text":"This is usually my go to place since it's in my neighborhood. The same ladies usually work here and make the best drinks and are super friendly and attentive. Tonight was absolutely horrible. I walked in at the same time as another couple, sat at the bar and waited while the bartender presented them with menus AND made their drinks, never getting an acknowledgement at all. Finally, she comes over and asks if she can help me and I have to ask for a menu. Now, I typically order a mixed drink of theirs that has a smoked peach in it. It's pretty much the star of the drink. She looked at the menu multiple times because I don't think she knew how to make the drink and guess what? She dropped the lukewarm drink WITHOUT THE PEACH!!! I asked for it and she said they were out which would been helpful to know BEFORE she made the drink. What a huge disappointment. Maybe that's why I'm the only one here right now..."}
{"text":"Wheelfish is the best new suburb bar in Pittsburgh. The location is just off McKnight or Babcock, only several miles from downtown. The aesthetics are awesome. It's a fresh new rustic look done right. The BBQ is incredible. Expecting their menu to expand but hopefully not too much! A bar that serves a limited menu is great because you know they are doing it right. Hands down the best whiskey selection outside of any downtown/Lawrenceville bar. I mean this - coming from a huge bourbon and rye fan. Live music is also a key ingredient in this place. Plenty of parking, room to stretch out and bourbon & beer to drink. Do yourself a favor and check this place out over the holiday season!"}
{"text":"Great place for local hangout with great food! Fantastic beer, paired with excellent live music on the weekends. The smoked foods match the barnhouse atmosphere. Very authentic."}
{"text":"Great bbq sauces. Reminded me of Texas. Fries were good. Napa slaw seemed a bit underseasoned. Had the smoked salmon sandwich. It came alive with the spicy BBQ sauce.  The brisket was nice and smoky too. Portions are not humongous but still very filling."}
{"text":"Excellent bar food!  Tucked away location worth it. Band was excellent and welcome surprise too. Order the nachos or wings the do not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"This is a true hidden gem! I can't believe I just recently found this place. It is tucked away in a neighborhood so it's nothing you see from the main road. As soon as you walk up to the door there is a smoker on the side and the smell makes your mouth drool. Everytime I have been here it has been packed. Your best bet to getting a table is having a small party.

The restaurant is so cute inside. They have a great selection of bottle beers and interesting cocktails but are slacking on the draft beers. The food is ridiculously good. The nachos, ribs, pulled pork, mac n cheese, and coleslaw are all spectacular! Plus they often have some kind of different band on stage. This is such a different  kind of restaurant for this area and the best BBQ I've had in Pittsburgh. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the north hills worth the drive! Classic barbecue and sides... great menu selections."}
{"text":"Disappointing barbecue honestly. Meat was tough and not particularly flavorful. The corn bread was dry. The veggies were fine but nothing special. Tried the pork and brisket and was very disappointed. To be fair, we lived in Texas briefly and nothing compares to Franklins."}
{"text":"Really good! Super gluten friendly with staff members who are Celiac. Most of the menu were things I could actually have! They have 2 choices of gluten free beer. The food was delicious too btw :)"}
{"text":"Overall, great service and good food. If you have a hankering for some BBQ, this is probably the best spot in the Pittsburgh area.

Being from Texas, I have a high standard of barbecue. Over all wheelfish has good barbecue for being so far north. We got the brisket and the ribs. The ribs were great! The brisket was a little fatty and not as tender and juicy. They had a small smoker out front so they probably have to cook the meat at a high pressure and shorter amount of time, which keeps the fat from breaking down. The ribs however were very good and I'd recommend that. There are other options like chicken and salmon, along with a bunch of sides like mac-n-cheese, fries, veggies, etc.

They have a ton of beer options. I got a root beer float- it was great! They have 3 sauce options- traditional, sweet and hot; all were good. The waitress was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place and need to work it into the rotation a little more often. Excellent barbecue - the chicken and pulled pork are standouts. Great drink selection and a few clever, high end cocktails. Super country vibe, which is great if you're into that. Friendly staff. Sweet potato fries and whatever they give you to dip them in are awesome. Also recommend the pulled pork nachos."}
{"text":"I visited Wheelfish after thanksgiving and I cannot wait to go back. I am not from the area, but was visiting friends and I am glad we chose to go there for dinner and drinks. Loved the aesthetic of the bar, so nicely decorated. The live music was an added touch to the dining experience; loud enough that you could enjoy it, but quiet enough so that you could easily enjoy conversation with friends. 
They have a good food selection which is different than your normal bar food. Good smoked meats and a nice selection of side dishes. I had the sweat potato fries (the dipping sauce was amazing!), the bbq pulled pork sandwich and the slaw; all were great! 
The girls working were friendly and accommodating.  
There is a wide variety of drink selections available for someone who enjoys craft beer. I was with a friend who loves bourbon and he was in heaven. My favorite drink was their take on a Mexican mule; made with vodka but with an added jalape√±o. It was the best mule I've ever had and I haven't been able to find one as good. 
I'm going to be back to the area soon and cannot wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"OMFG.   Smoked flash fried half chicken was incredible.    Desert a home made ice cream sandwich.    A+"}
{"text":"I wish there was such a thing as 3.5 - 3.75 stars... because this ranks just under 4 stars. My husband and I came here with another couple on a Wednesday night. The restaurant is tucked in at the beginning of a housing development right off of the main street. The gravel parking lot is large and would accommodate quite a few guests. However, the back of a strip mall abuts the lot, which is not the most ideal situation and could be a potential eye sore. 

The building is inviting from the outside, as it perfectly fits the BBQ, rustic theme. The inside is dimly lit, with several dining options: small tables, a long table overlooking the main dining area, and the bar. We opted for the bar as the live music was quite loud and we wanted to have conversation with our friends. The bartender was very friendly and attentive - I would go back for the sole sake of having her again! There are 4-5 different meat options prepared a couple ways. I had 1/4 lb pulled pork with the pork and beans. The BBQ sauces were very good - spicy was just that, regular was a nice blend of spices, and sweet was sweet, my favorite! The pork and beans were just ok, however my friend had the sweet potato fries (I stole a few) and they were very good! The food was a little pricey, however it is one of the better places I have been for BBQ in Pittsburgh. 

If you enjoy smoked meats and traditional BBQ/picnic sides, this is a place to put on your list. A little pricey and located off the beaten path, however, it's worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Wheelfish is a great local bar/ restaurant with top of the line food and drink. As another reviewer mentioned, the food is not your typical bar fare, but delicious smoked meats and home cooked sides. I personally got the smoked chicken and sweet potato fries. Although it is true, these items are separate, I think my meal was only around $15, which is what you would pay if these items were sold together. Both were piping hot, chicken was super juicy, and fries crisped to perfection.

Even better than the food was a specialty drink called \"Make my Mule Mexican.\" At first I thought this was tequila based, but to my delight it was not. It was a delicious vodka mule with a dash of jalapeno, to cut the sweetness of the mule. They have lots of craft beer for the beer snobs, but also reasonably priced American drafts for the traditionalists. 

When I visited Wheelfish, it was right after the opening, and although there were only two girls working, they ran their butts off, we stayed hydrated and had a great time listening to some live music. I was happy to hear that they do plan on expanding the menu to inculde more share-ables as they get some kinks worked out. 

I loved visiting this neighborhood bar, with such an eclectic feel."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Wheelfish. We had previously been there when it was Frank N Steins and could see all the work they did outside & inside to renovate the property. It has a cool rustic feel. There is a bar area, separate restaurant area & little stage for live music. They are only open over the weekend.

Everything is a la carte. My husband and I shared the chicken (moist & delicious with the skin), smoked beef brisket (delicious, brought to you dry & they have multiple sauces they bring to you that you can put on - I didn't care for the sauces, but my husband did like the Cowboy), delicious sweet potato fries & the corn muffin (my husband loved it. I thought it had a weird taste). It was definitely enough food for both of us. You don't get a lot of brisket (small portion), but do get a lot of chicken (small portion). 

When the chicken first came it was not cooked enough. My husband sent it back & they were very nice about it. The owner brought it out, apologized & gave it to us for free because she wanted us to have a good first experience. The waitress was also very nice. They know good customer service & could teach a few local restaurants a thing or two.

They have a cooler that you could get mix & match 6 packs to go. They have a great craft beer selection & good imports. The only bad thing was they thought Blue Moon was domestic. 

Great place! You definitely need to check it out. We'll be back & are happy to have a great local place."}
{"text":"Being former Shadyside residents turned suburbanites my husband and I often express our disappointment to now be surrounded by chain restaurants when we once surrounded by an array of unique cuisine options. Enter Wheelfish.

The menu is not overwhelming, focusing on BBQ and a few accompaniments. The specialty cocktail list has a nice array of selections. I really enjoyed my gin cocktail, Heart of Darkness. There's also a range of rotated craft beers and ciders.

My husband ordered the chili, which was very generous with the meats and had just the right amount of spice to it. The included cornbread was savory and well portioned with the chili. I went with the spinach and bacon salad, adding chicken and the sheep's milk feta from their beet salad. Perfection. We brought our (almost) 9 month old who happily helped us polish off the tomato bisque.

The staff was friendly and attentive, working together to ensure everyone was cared for and enjoying themselves. 

They also support local musicians by offering them space to perform for their patrons. 

The ambiance is very modern. Reclaimed wooden walls. Edison bulb light fixtures. Vintage window ceiling fixtures.

The pricing was also very fair. For the chili, tomato soup, salad, a beer and a cocktail we paid about $40 before tip. Definitely not a bad Friday out!"}
{"text":"I went to Wheelfish recently with my two teenaged kids.  Good beer selection and my kids liked their burgers, but my chicken and grilled vegetable serving was quite small.  Their bbq offerings seem very legit, but I was surprised with my very spare portion.  Otherwise, quite good."}
{"text":"On a Saturday night, the place was packed but they managed to squeeze us into a side table with a great view of the stage.  We had to flag down the manager to ask if we had a server because other tables around us were all being served and we were thirsty.  Evidently, the hostesses need to inform the wait staff who has which table and she forgot to assign someone to us.  Both the manager and the hostess were supremely apologetic.  Perfect response in such a situation. Now, the service is chaotic, grant you, and a little slow but this mom and pop BBQ joint gets the job done.

We ordered the smoked eggplant, the grilled veggies side, and a few beers to start.  The grilled veggies were al dente and perfectly cooked.  The eggplant came with a tomato ragout over it.  Eggplant being the super porous veggie that it is, absorbed all of the smoke in the smoking process so it sort of overpowered you with smoky flavor.  Some might like it that smoky but I would maybe recommend a shorter smoke time for that so it has a hint of smokiness instead of a sock in the mouth of smokiness. Otherwise, as did the grilled veggies, they need to find their salt and pepper shakers because nothing was seasoned.  

For entrees, we both got the salmon.  I ordered the quarter and my partner, the half pound portion (see pics of side by side sizing so you have an idea of the portions).  The salmon was very good other than needing some seasoning and the mac and cheese was superbly creamy and delicious.  The pork and beans were a little on the runny side and tasted really good.

The live music started at 8PM and added a nice background and they adjusted the volume to ensure people weren't being blasted out but could hear her.  Mary Lou Scherder did a nice set of 1970's and 1980's era hits and some country songs. Looks like she plays once a month.

We will try it again because everyone, patrons and staff, were super nice.  Think we'll try the brisket or ribs next time and maybe order up some bourbon to go with it."}
{"text":"BBQ in Pittsburgh? Hmmm...it honestly wasn't what I was expected and that's a good thing. Meat was tender and smoky...I wish it could have come with the bark because that's my favorite part of eating BBQ. The sides were filling and tasty. There was plenty of parking but this establishment is kind of hidden so keep your eyes peeled!"}
{"text":"Wheelfish was amazing !!!! From the time we pulled up to the very end. The building is so cool looking it's sad that's it's a little hidden. We walk in and get greeted by the chef welcoming us in and right after the hostess. She asked us where we would prefer to sit which I really appreciated we did sit pretty close to the live band but I didn't mind and they were great! Let's talk about the food.... AMAZING. I got the pulled pork sandwich and my girlfriend got the brisket quesadilla. BEST quesadilla I have ever had hands down! Our waitress was awesome, very friendly ! Another great thing was that the chef brought out a dish for us to try not sure what it was but it was great! This place has it all. I'm telling you you gotta go try it ! It's awesome !!! 10/10 for sure !!"}
{"text":"Solid place for smoked meats. We only had the pulled pork nacho and it was the tits. Defently will be coming back to try some others!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at the Wheelfish for dinner on a Wednesday night.  There was a good crowd along with live music.  Our table ordered family style and everything was great.  They even had fresh jalape√±os x 2"}
{"text":"New restaurant VERY GOOD!! Great atmosphere and Vegan/Vegetarian/Pescatarian friendly menu with eggplant dish and salmon sandwich. Very spacious, cozy and has a live band! Great food, prices and experience!"}
{"text":"You have to come off the main road to find this place, and if you do it will sooo be worth it. Smoked meats including chicken and salmon along with red meat are served straight up with a veg, on a salad, or in a sandwich. The beet salad with chicken and the chicken with a side of veg are two of my favorite things to order. Pair that with a cool new-rustic atmosphere and regular acoustic bands and this place will have you sneaking out of the sea of chain restaurants and into your favorite new place. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Since first opening, Wheelfish has improved its menu. It now offers meals that include sides instead of serving everything a la carte. I really like this update to the menu! They also have expanded their menu to include more offerings and I can't wait to work my way through them!"}
{"text":"Started coming here recently and really enjoy it. Very cool atmosphere inside especially when there is live music (which seems to be pretty much all the time). The whiskey selection is the best you're going to find outside of the city. The BBQ can be hit or miss sometimes, but is always passable. The mac and cheese is fantastic."}
{"text":"Service poor, menu weak with very limited selections. Dark, poor lighting and big tables that are uncomfortably. No hurry to ever return Eve though it is very close to home.  I think they need to expand their menu and improve their presentation. Service needs to be worked on. 
Maybe it is strictly geared to be a drinking bar, not a restaurant/bar."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. We had the Brisket with Mac n Cheese and Salmon with Sweet Potato Fries. The fries were some of the best I've ever had. The meat is a dry BBQ and sauces are served on the side. We tried the sweet and original. Both were very tasty. We even liked the music, a very nice mix. Run don't walk to this local gem!!!'"}
{"text":"The food at wheelfish is amazing! My husband had the ribs... so good! I had the brisket quesadilla. The brisket quesadilla was delicious. For an appetizer we had the pulled pork nachos. Best nachos I have ever had! The atmospheric is fun, kinda hipster with a live band. Really great place to visit in the north hills on a Friday night! Our waiter Nick K was so friendly and went above and beyond to make sure we had a fabulous time! 5+ stars to the wheelfish"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! We shared the chicken wings which were great, and I had the brisket with a corn muffin (yum!) and Mac and cheese. My boyfriend had the pulled pork sandwich which was amazing and French fries which were super fresh and crunchy. Warning- it fills up quick and on the weekends they don't take reservations so get there early or prepare to wait."}
{"text":"Love love love BBQ and this place was just meh - maybe it's because we got take out. Friends highly recommended so will give it a second go and eat in.   Our take out was expensive for 2 sandwiches and 3 sides. Sandwiches had minimal sauce and no extra side of sauce."}
{"text":"Pulled pork Nachos and the smoked wings are REALLY good but these are the only dishes I have enjoyed. Brisket is my favorite BBQ dish but theirs needs some improvement in my opinion. For a neighborhood bar and restaurant Its convenient but I also feel its a little overpriced."}
{"text":"Wheelfish is a cool bar with good drinks and a great vibe. The food is pretty awesome as well. Cool vibe for live music good food and some beers.

Kinda has a hip modern barn feel to it."}
{"text":"I went with my family on a Wednesday at 6:30 for dinner. The menu is small but perfect. I figure if you are doing Barbeque and have a small menu, do it well. They did. I had the pulled pork sandwich with nappa cabbage and BBQ sauce, Mac n cheese, and the not your Mexican mule. The pork was tender and delicious, the bbq sauce perfect, and the mac n cheese may have been the best I've ever had. This is a hidden gem in the north hills off of Thompson Run Rd. My family had ribs, brisket, pulled park nachos, brisket quesadilla, corn bread,  and some draft beers. Everyone liked their food. It all looked very good to me. The server was awesome and very informative.

The ambiance was very rustic barn like... wooden walls, cool lighting, awesome tables and benches..... They had live music at 7. He was awesome. He played the acoustic guitar and sang while we were there and I also seen he brought his electric guitar, but we left before he plugged that in. It wasn't too loud so you could still hold a conversation with the table. The trays for the food were cool and different, mac n cheese came in a little glass bowl thing... It was presented awesome. They had 3 different types of BBQ sauces which were all homemade. 

This place is awesome to sit in or takeout. I will return. They also have a large amount of Bourbons and some pretty cool craft cocktails."}
{"text":"Really cool spot to have a drink and relax. The ambiance is great and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place even existed. Not even 5 minutes from my house... this could be dangerous!!! SO cute."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in the north hills, literally! It sits right behind Adrian's Pizza off of Thompson Run Road. This is exactly what this area needed since there are a ton of chain restaurants and I am not a big fan of chains. I grew up in a small town that was filled with mom and pop restaurants and I always loved these types of places. I stumbled upon Wheelfish on Facebook one night and was so eager to try it! I have been looking for a good bbq spot and this place is it. 

If you are looking for a place to grab drinks they have a pretty big bar area or if you are looking to grab drinks to go you can build your own six pack. 
The menu is simple and I honestly didn't mind it being that way. I ordered pulled pork ($5)(quarter pound) and a side of mac and cheese ($5). The menu is a la carte so you are going to pay for your sides if you want them. The mac and cheese was homemade and topped with bread crumbs. Very creamy! The pulled pork was also very tasty and just enough for me. It also comes in a half pound if you are really hungry. My mom ordered a half rack of ribs ($13) with a side of curly fries. I did try her ribs and fries and I LOVED them both. The ribs were a dry rub, but they do have 3 different bbq sauces to add to your meal if you wish to make things more saucy. The curly fries came out with a special homemade sauce on the side and I wish I knew what was in this sauce because I put it on everything it was so good! 

I really loved everything about this place the rustic decor, the simple menu, and great food. Everyone, go try Wheelfish you will not be disappointed! Finally, a relaxing place I can go to that's so close to home!"}
{"text":"My first and only visit to Wheelfish. The ribs did NOT fall off the bone. The Mac and cheese was one step above box Mac and cheese. My wife pulled pork was average and her sweet potato fries were good. Service was slow although she was friendly. It's a cute inside. Please try it and make up your own mind."}
{"text":"Hidden off McKnight Road, we hadn't heard of Wheelfish until recently, despite searching for great BBQ in Pittsburgh. We split the quesadilla and nachos for appetizers. Both good, but I'd rather save room for the main event. We tried the brisket and ribs. Ribs are St Louis style. We prefer baby backs but still enjoyed the flavor of the ribs. Brisket was great. I agree with other reviews that the brisket is dry, but it's flavorful. Add some of the spicy BBQ sauce and it's delicious. Definitely go for the 1/2 pound portion. Leftovers heated up well in the oven the next day. Mac and cheese for me is very hit or miss, but I was very happy with the mac and cheese at Wheelfish. Reasonably priced drinks, as well."}
{"text":"I have been to every BBQ place in and around this city. Hands down the best ribs and sides. Sauces are very flavorful and delicious."}
{"text":"The nachos! I dream about their nachos. I can't put into words why I like them. I suggest trying them for yourself. 

We love this hidden gem. They smoke their own BBQ and make delicious side dishes. Their menu isn't extensive but what they offer is excellent. My husband's favorite option is the salmon sandwich (I know weird when I just said this was BBQ joint). 

The drinks are a pricey but they have a nice beer selection and they make a great jalape√±o Moscow mule."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a decent restaurant close to home and decided to try Wheelfish out. It is a cute western themed neighborhood bar. The menu is very small and simple. I had the ribs. They were good, but lacked moisture. They were only dry rubbed and smoked, I wish they would have basted them with sauce while they were cooking along with the rub."}
{"text":"Fun times at Wheelfish! On a side road a bit north of Pittsburgh, you definitely wouldn't expect it. It was small on the inside but I loved the feel of the place with the deep woods and lower lighting. They have music on a stage on one side of the restaurant with a bar and some tvs on the other side. A blues rock band called Strange Brew played and they were good! It was a good mix of the food and music and the music wasn't so loud that you couldn't talk.

The menu was impressive for a mostly barbecue place. They even had a fancy salad with beets and candied pecans. Their main dishes were ribs and brisket and those types of things but the surprise item for me in that section was the smoked eggplant!! It was really cool they had that option, although I was too full to try it. 

I opted for a bunch of sides (which ended up being extremely filling). I ordered the seasonal vegetables, which included zucchini, carrots, squash etc. The seasoning was perfect on them but a few were a bit harder than I like(I love squishy zucchini especially). I ordered the mac n cheese and it was a smooth and creamy dream. Came in a jar with breadcrumbs on top and was really rich and everything I'd expect. I also ordered a corn bread muffin. Those are the bomb! This one came with some raspberries inside of it. Really good. 

Definitely have to come back to try that eggplant!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after a long work day to see some friends perform. Wasn't going to get anything to eat but the smell of the smoker upon entering the place changed my mind. I got the brisket with Mack and cheese. The Mac and cheese was good had a nice crust on top with nice cheesy flavor. I was disappointed in with be brisket though. It had nice flavor but was pretty dried out and a bit tough.
The decor was nice and when the cooker was bringing a piece of pork in from out side he gave me and my boyfriend a sample and it was delicious and tender.
Maybe I got a bad batch of brisket wished I got the pork instead. Place worth another try and some of the other dishes I saw looked like worth a taste."}
{"text":"Wheelfish is worth the drive wherever you live in the greater Pittsburgh area! It is on Thompson's Run Road and I came from the Babcock Blvd side. There are many signs warning of the road being closed ahead, but the road is open to Wheelfish from this direction. Just ignore the detours. 

They have a small selection of craft draft beers and a much larger list of bottled crafts. I sat at the bar and enjoyed listening to the local patrons. This is their neighborhood bar. 

It was $2.00 Taco night so I ordered 2 with a salad and Mac n cheese. My salad was so fresh, with lovely greens and a homemade citrus vinaigrette. The Mac n cheese was just like mom used to make and topped with garlic breadcrumbs! Delicious!

The tortillas were brown on edges like they were warmed on the grill. YUM! My Pork taco was outstanding. So full of flavor! I tried each of the homemade BBQ sauces in separate bites. Every sauce was good, but I favored the Spicy Texas sauce. The Brisket taco was a little shy on the brisket but the green peppers and onions were so good and the chimchurri was excellent!

I will definitely return to this hidden gem BBQ place out in the wilds of the North Hills."}
{"text":"Good food. Prices a little high for small plate. But the brisket is amazing and the salted Health Ice Cream Sandwich was to die for."}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough. I was looking for a spot between here and there and Wheelfish was the perfect fit this evening.

I started with Smoked Georgia Peach cocktail. It was fresh, boozy and had a light smoked flavor. For dinner I ordered the Roasted Beet Salad with Salmon and a Blueberry Corn Muffin. The salad was tossed perfectly with a citrus vinaigrette. I enjoyed all of the components of yellow raisins, sheep milk feta and candied pecans. The salmon was smoked to perfection and had a glazed crust which hit the spot. I thought the corn muffin was dry and the server promptly told me she would comp it. 

From the service, to the delicious food, to the great rustic atmosphere of an old barn, I thoroughly enjoyed Wheelfish and will be back."}
{"text":"So glad I decided to try this hidden gem! There is live music and a fun environment. Meat is smoked right outside.

We shared the brisket with fries and the ribs with vegetables. The ribs were phenomenal and fall-off-the-bone tender. The brisket was good but nothing special. Vegetables were also good but not amazing. The fries were so amazing. They were hot and crunchy and we would have ordered more if we weren't so full from everything else! 

I'll definitely be back to enjoy the good food and good vibes. Free parking on site."}
{"text":"We went to Wheelfish yesterday for our anniversary.  It is a small joint in the middle of Mccandless, and we are so glad we found it!  My husband is a BBQ fiend, and he drags me to every BBQ in and around Pittsburgh.  This place is the real deal.  Food is reasonably priced, fresh, delicious and smokey perfection.  Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. We had the pulled pork nachos... All people should try these nachos, they are amazing! The pulled pork is one of the BEST we've ever had, they make their own queso AND chips! SO DANG GOOD!!  My hubs had the smoked salmon and the brisket and I had the brisket. Everything is great, the fish was delicious and the brisket was tender and sooo good.  

They have a full bar and lots of local beers.  They also have a cooler with bottles, lots of random beers- seasonal, ciders, etc...  It was great for a picky beer drinker like me!  

We will most definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Went here as recommendation on a friend. A nice choice for the food and atmosphere. Can't say the same for the service or host. Wrote comment on the receipt with a phone number realized they are closed on Sundays. Still would of thought that the server would of shown the manager and would of heard from someone. Well let's see if they see this review and reach out. Would go back for food prob sit at bar and eat. 

The manager reached out with in minutes of post to apologize and discuss. Will be giving a chance."}
{"text":"We chose Wheelfish to celebrate a birthday since seeing the segment on our local TV station. The service was very good! I had the salmon & Napa slaw which was smoked & excellent. My husband had the brisket which disappointingly was fatty though his Mac & cheese side was yummy. Our guests ordered the chicken & pulled pork with sweet potato fries & they loved it! Great selection of brews as well. Be aware that the place tends to get loud & we were there when the live entertainment was not playing. All & all I'd go back & give it another go!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Friday nights ago with my wife.  We ended up headed to Wheelfish because one of my bowling teammates told me that it was good.  Whenever we arrived to the restaurant at right around 7 PM both the bar and the restaurant were jam packed.  Thankfully there ended up being a single two top available which we were seated at.  The unfortunate part about that was that it was near the door and so it was cold every time someone came in or out which happened frequently.  The inside of wheelfish is composed of two levels with the top level consisting of the bar sitting a couple of feet above the dining room.  The walls are decorated with what looked like reclaimed wood and the night that we were there a live band was playing.

For our entrees on this evening my wife and I decided to split a ton of different meats as we often do at BBQ restaurants.  So my wife went with the smoked eggplant with a side of sweet potato fries while I went with the brisket with a side of Mac and cheese.  Then we also also ordered 1/4 pounds of chicken and pulled pork.  It all looked pretty good whenever it was delivered to the table with my only concern being the fact that the chicken was still on the bone which I don't like.  Ironically the chicken ended up being my favorite thing due to the spice rub on the outside and the fact that it was cooked nicely.  The pulled pork was flavorful and juicy and while I enjoyed the brisket it was weird for me to see a 1/2 pound of it cut into only 3 strips.  My least favorite main dish of the night ended up being the smoked eggplant which while good and certainly the most innovative wasn't completely my cup of tea.  Out of the sides I liked the sweet potato fries better and thought that the Mac and cheese was adequate although nothing to rave about.  After we had finished our meals my wife asked to see the dessert menu which consisted entirely of Leona ice cream sandwiches.  It's good to see one local business supporting another!

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Hopefully next time we get a seat a little further away from othe door but I thought that the food was good and enjoyed the live music."}
{"text":"I came into the restaurant to catch the live music and shared two dinners with my son on a Friday night.  The d√©cor is great and so was the music.  The wait staff was a bit young and inexperienced, when I contacted the owner he really took the time to find out about my dining experience.  Any independent restaurant such as Wheel Fish is competing against 'Goliath' in my opinion.  I will always choose the small guy, Wheel Fish has my vote for innovative smoked dinners and great music.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Nice bbq place that we need in this area.  Enjoyed the atmosphere and the food.  Everything is ala carte but the portions are good.  Much enjoyed the brisket and pulled pork"}
{"text":"Such a great local place in the North Hills. Good drinks and also the BBQ food is impressive.  Also happy to say that they support local music."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant in the north hills. It looks like a barn in a neighborhood. The pulled pork nachos were my favorite thing we ordered. Also had the brisket and ribs. The ribs were also really great with a dry rub. The one thing I would change about this place is the price of the cocktails. They are $9-11 and are about the size of a shot."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place out as it was on Your Pittsburgh. The service was awful.  I can't blame the 2 servers/bartenders but they were just overwhelmed doing the whole place as it was full.  The food took forever as well.  I had the brisket and was disappointed with the portion size.  My date had smoked eggplant and it was just plain terrible.  Very disappointed as this is my kind of place.  I loved this decor of the place but maybe I just caught them on a bad night?"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best restaurants I've been to in a while! It's such a great atmosphere and the ribs are phenomenal! Not to mention the ice cream sandwiches!  

Our server was a doll, I wish I knew her name!"}
{"text":"This is a mixed review. I really wanted to like the food as everyone else at my table did - but my chicken and cornbread were terribly dry. So dry the cornbread crumbled and the chicken was hard to swallow. The flavor was great but the texture and dryness made the food hard to enjoy. 

My Fresca drink was delicious and refreshing - tart but not too much. The nachos were enjoyable with the fresh chips and pulled pork. I tried a bite of the short ribs - good. The coleslaw with toasted pecans was delicious. 

The ambiance is homey with a rustic look.

On Saturday night there was a fun 
entertaining band - just be ready for it to be loud."}
{"text":"When I pulled up to Wheelfish my initial thought was \"oh wow that's cool.\" It's a rustic looking barn with Wheelfish lit up on top of it - almost looks engraved into the building. Anyway, I started to think \"I hope this isn't one of those places that are weird to you if you're not a regular.\" But before I could even finish the thought, the head chef says \"Hey Welcome to Wheelfish!\" Then the hostess gave us options of where we'd like to sit... wow such a small gesture really goes a long way. Haven't felt this special since my 8th birthday but I'll take it. We get seated really close to the live band, which would usually bother me but it didn't at all. The waitress was perfect - friendly but not too much and the service was excellent overall. I ordered a brisket quesadilla... so good omg. I didn't think the second coming of Jesus would be in the form of a quesadilla but I was very, very wrong. Before we could finish the head chef came over and brought us these things to try. No idea what it was but I ate it and it was great. I started to get suspicions... do they think we are food critics? But once again I was wrong. The chef came back out with more plates for everyone to try. What a nice guy, and what a nice place. 10/10 def recommend"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some good BBQ, give Wheelfish a try.  Good BBQ in a reclaimed wood environment.  Really friendly and good service.  Was told they do have live Blues music some nights. Will have to stop by and have some Q, Blues & Bourbon.  
Decided to try the ribs and Mac & Cheese.  The ribs were well cooked and tender with nice flavors.  It did come with a little side (a couple of bits) of picked onions, a couple of pickled green beans and some lettuce.  The Mac & Cheese was creaming and both were piping hot.  The have three sauces you can use - The Cowboy is the spicy, a Traditional and a sweet."}
{"text":"I just moved to the north hills from NY and am in love with the vibe of this place. I got the brisket my friend got the salmon. Slaw, mac and cheese, also smoked eggplant. Everything was amazing also had ice cream sandwich for dessert. I had the tequila drink that's like a margarita on the rocks. Live entertainment topped it off... had no clue but when I walked in from the parking lot to the Altman bros I knew this place is a gem. Will be back here many times in sure"}
{"text":"Such an unusual find in the North Hills but great barbecue! I love the option to select a local craft beer from the cooler. The barbecue is the real deal...the smoker outside of the restaurant tells you you're in for a treat. My husband and I love this spot for a weeknight date. Have to give it 4 of 5 stars because I really want to love their appetizers but they all feel a bit \"forced\". As though they're looking to put barbecue on things like nachos etc and those dishes don't really jump out as being spectacular, but the barbecue itself is. Still a go-to. We love it!"}
{"text":"We really liked this place. Surprisingly good, given the location off the beaten path. We had brisket, ribs and salmon, and they were all tender, smoky, not dried out. I've been known to fire up the smoker myself and I was impressed. Service was attentive, and everyone was nice, including the singer-songwriter that was performing. The cocktail menu was fun, too. We will be back."}
{"text":"Husband and I have been searching high and low for good barbecue since moving here from the South two years ago, and we FINALLY found it at Wheelfish. The pulled pork is perfect, slaw adds a great tangy crunch (not mayonaise-y, which I love), and the sides were all incredible as well. We had the blueberry cornbread, pork & beans, Mac & cheese, and sweet potato fries - all delicious and perfect portions. Last but not least, the live music was a huge bonus!! We'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that we would find this type of BBQ at this little place in the North Hills and by this type of BBQ I mean good BBQ...no great BBQ! Wow! Little unassuming place off of Thompson Run Rd in the North Hills. Our service was terrific but the BBQ...wow! You pull into the parking lot and the smoker is tapping on your nose with the wonderful smell of sweet goodness. Fantastic! The meat that we tried, pulled pork, beef brisket, and ribs, all were fantastic! Juicy and, and the flavors, wow! Mouthwatering good!!! The beef brisket was hands down our favorite (both me and the hubby agree). This is some of the best brisket I have ever had in my life!!!! Don't get me wrong though, all of the meat was fabulous! The sauces are on the table so take your pick. I liked the sweet BBQ sauce best. This is a personal preference. All tasted pretty darn good though. We had sweet potato fries, regular fries, and seasonal cornbread which was blueberry when we were there. It was all so good.  Their regular fries, hand cut and dirty and deeeeeelicious!!! I am impressed and we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. The first time was a great experience and the service was good. The second time they seemed to be out of everything and the service was not impressive. I tried to order a burger but they were out, than we tried to order Irish mules but they were out of ginger beer. I ended up with a Manhattan which I did enjoy. My pulled pork was disappointing though. It was overdone. It had big pieces that were burnt to a crisp. It wasn't the kind of burn that makes bbq taste better, it was the kind of burnt taste that overpowers the dish. I would give it another chance because my friends did enjoy their meals. Maybe I caught them on an off night."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great little place in a residential looking area but a fantastic place! We had a bunch of people with us and they were prompt and didn't get a single order wrong. We will be back that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Solid barbecue spot with a rustic atmosphere, great service, strong drinks, and artisanal ice cream sandwiches for dessert. 

The half portion of ribs had a great,slightly sweet bark, and lots of meat underneath that was fall-off-the-bone tender. Others in my party had the smoked-then-fried chicken, which was juicy with a crispy skin, with a pleasingly subtle smoky flavor. 

We had the smoked peach and Manhattan, Pennsylvania drinks, and they were right good thanks to top-shelf liquor and butters as a base. 

Would love to come back when they have live music.  Super chill and intimate venue for that."}
{"text":"First time visit. Very cool atmosphere and vibe. Nice tables and awesome bar area as well. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Tried the brisket which was very tasty and with their different sauces you get to add on your own you will definitely find one you will enjoy.the salmon was very good sized portion and tasted perfectly smoked. Tried the fries which were very good and the mac and cheese which was even better. The slaw was different with candied pecans on top wihich was really tasty. Great local draft list and lots of bottles to choose from. I would recommend 100%"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere! The bartenders are terrific and the owner Katie is fantastic!! Definitely get the corn muffin- it's not your mothers it's better! A great stop in the north hills!"}
