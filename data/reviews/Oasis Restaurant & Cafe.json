{"text":"I've been there once.  The service was bad... The Shishas were strange too. I don't know what they put in the shisha."}
{"text":"FOUND HAIR IN FOOD. This is the last place i would ever go, the food tasted days old and my friend found a hair in it, when we complained the owner did not seem to care and kept telling us how much the bill was. Then i mentioned to my friend in front of the owner \"their charging us for the food we found a hair in\" the owner got so mad and told me verbatim \"I do not care about you or your F***in business, pay me my money now and get out\" even as i was being as polite as possible to him. This was the worst service experiance i have had in my life and this guy does not deserve to run a service oriented business. I paid the bill and left to avoid any hassle as he continued to rant on and try to intimidate us as if we were in a third world country (keep in mind he is 6ft+). Nobody deserves this type of treatment and I highly discourage anyone to dine here. I have heard similar expierences from others at this place and wish i have never gone there in the first place."}

{"text":"The Oasis Juice Bar is a solid venue to smoke some shisha and grab a bite and drink to eat. The venue is spacious and never too overcrowded. One would think that a hookah venue would be smoke ridden but Oasis really isn't that bad, it is ventilated very well and they keep the place clean making for an inviting atmosphere.    The food itself is actually pretty good for the price. Apps include hommous tehini, baba ghannouj, falafel and tabouli to name a few.  Mains include shawarma plates, steaks, BBQ chicke, burgers and platters. They also provide an array of other sandwiches such as beef and chicken shawarmas (and plates), shish kebobs, shish kafta, makanik, and sujuk (salty). The shawarma for example is not blow you out of the water hello Shawarma of the month amazing, but it is fresh and enjoyable.  All the food, especially the sandwiches are reasonably priced.    I've never tried the desert there but I'm sure it's good. One thing I know for sure is that the juices are all very tasty. I usually order the Oasis Cocktail which is kind of like their house special drink, it's a combination of mango, guava, persimmon, chopped banan topped with Oasis cream (?), pistachios and honey.   In terms of shisha Oasis's flavour list boasts mint, grape, double apple, orange, mixed fruit and a few others. On the majority of occasions I've been there they haven't had the flavours requested, one had to pay for extra coal, and the pipes taste like double apple as that is the majority flavour of shisha being smoked in it, or they simply do not clean them properly. If you have nowehere else to go to smoke shisha or don't own a pipe, then this would not be a bad spot to hit. They do provide you with plastic mouth pieces sealed in plastic which is very clutch when dealing with public hookah."}
{"text":"I've definitely had better.  My friend and I stumbled upon this place when we were looking for Middle Eastern places that might have vegetarian choices, and the other place I wanted to check out was closed for the night.  I am always taken in by neon signs and kitchy decor, and this place had it in spades... there was a room that had a camo theme, and  another that had an Egyptian ruin theme. Fantastic.  We both started with fruit juices which promised big (one promised to terminate all your desires) and were actually quite good. The appetizers were great, the veggie stuffed grape leaves were great, as were the samosas, which were deep fried to perfection. The tabouli was extremely fresh, but the tomatoes were still orange. The hummous had a liver sort of flavour to it, which I enjoyed, but my vegetarian friend did not. She really enjoyed the baba ganoush and I didn't. The pitas were dry and brittle, which really bugged me.   The service was really nice and sweet, but slow. It took us an hour to get our food, which wasn't a big deal since weren't in a rush, but that was way too long to wait for what we ordered. I will probably not be back, since there is better. This might be a shisha place first, and a food place second."}
{"text":"Loss of points for this review. First lets start out by saying the name of the establishment, and food items have been changed. It is now the \"Oasis Restaurant & Cafe\" The Banana smoothie is now The Banana Blast, the Oasis Cocktail is now the Oasis Fruit Explosion.  Not enough of a change that you will be lost however, enough of one that may confuse people.  Pretty much everything has some kind of a name change to it.  I was in Toronto for a week with my  fiancee and this place was meant to be our last \"night out\" place to go. Leaving Sunday afternoon means lunch was the only other meal we were going to have so we decided this would be a great place to relax, eat food, talk, chill out and have a great time talking about the trip we had. Unfortunately this was not to be. 3 out of the 4 servers, while cute and good to look at, have no real grasp on the spoken English language.  Everything we ordered was not understood, and we basically had to point it out on the menu and hope that it was ordered correctly. Our server (the one from Serbia) was always asking if everything was ok and constantly apologizing. She told us this was her first day, a lie that both my fiancee and I knew immediately because we had been served by her 4 weeks prior. I came to find out later that when I went to the bathroom she went to the table to ask why I looked angry and tried to ensure that we were indeed having an ok time.  Now, I may not smile all the friggin time, but c'mon, I don't glower, especially enough for someone to pick up on who can't converse with me properly. Anyway that's getting a little much.. moving forward.  We got 2 drinks each, chicken shawarma, hummus, and babaganoush  Taste wise, everything was fantastic. Service wise, yet again, everything failed. Water costs money, she missed the fact that my fiencee ordered food, she missed her wanting another drink, she even forgot to bring the drink after it was ordered, she forgot to bring the food after it was done after 1 of the orders was brought out again. It was basically a Clusterf*ck Symphony #2 in F minor. There really was no point in trying to get any angrier, it would have just been futile.  After all our food was eaten we passed on the Hookah idea since we are all feeling rough with some kind of cold/flu/sore throat deal and got the check. 70.11 for everything we had. I gave the server my card and a few seconds later she came back saying their machine has been down ALL DAY. Now at this point I am beyond disillusioned and no amount of her apologizing was going to make up for it. I went to the ATM machine they have in their lobby and guess what. It's such a POS it doesn't even allow me to pull out funds from my account because it isn't Visa/Mastercard certified. What the hell? What kind of a place in 2009 has a ATM like this. I can get money from an ATM in the friggin Tundra for petes sake.  Luckily we were able to scrounge up 75 dollars and just left it on the table as we walked out quite disgusted with the whole experience. I felt like the night was almost a waste had it not been for the good tasting food still lingering in our mouths."}
{"text":"Oasis used to be my all time favourite chill spot for everyday of the week. That's when our stupid province put a smoking ban on indoor tobacco smoke and these types of restaurants are forced to offer herbal shisha/hookah or nothing.   Oasis is also under new management. Now the place looks like an army base, which some like but I think it's dumb. However the waitresses' all wear army uniforms, which isn't as bad as it sounds :)  The food was always a point or two above decent, with exception to their chicken shawarmas which were always amazing. Under the new management the food is pretty good from the few menu items I've tried, and the chicken shawarmas still amazing. However I have heard of some complain about take out shawarmas - so order them there and eat them while they're hot.  The shisha/hookah used to be great when they served tobacco pipes, then when they switched to herbal it was okay... \"smokable.\" However now I would have to say I am truly disappointed that a proclaimed shisha/hookah restaurant serves such disappointing shisha/hookah.   The rating of 3 stars is mainly for the food and the great service that this place has... if the shisha/hookah was good it would get a higher rating for sure. I would recommend going for some good eats, moderately priced, however for shisha/hookah, forget about it.   If it's shisha/hookah you're looking for, buy a pipe and some Al-Fakher flavour from the deli connected to Oasis (yes that's right, the deli), go home and smoke some quality shisha/hookah!!"}
{"text":"Oasis has always been one of my \"go-to\" places for hookah/shisha after a great tasting Middle-Eastern meal. I have been going to this place for about 7 years now.   Before the Ontario law banning smoking indoors went into effect Oasis used to use the real tobacco and smoking would be indoors as well as on the patio outdoors. Ever since the ban, smoking herbal tobacco indoors has been lame. I wouldn't blame Oasis for their hookah quality decreasing. During the summer it's very nice to sit outside on the patio and have shisha along with their Oasis special juice cocktail.   The food here is pretty good. I would definitely eat the food here although over the years the taste has changed. It used to be great tasting but now its only good. The service here though has dropped a lot. I don't know why but there are only 2 waiters working at a time even though it gets really busy on the weekends.   All in all, it's a good time-pass place with good food and shisha. The fries with hot sauce are amazing. The shish tawook sandwich is really good although at times it doesn't taste the same as the last time. They have the non-alcoholic beers that are flavored and their katayef (dessert) is amazing."}
{"text":"Ooooooo.  Scarborough right?  Wrong.  Well, technically yes, this place is in Scarborough...  But the point that I'm getting to is that Scarlum... ahm.  Excuse me... borough... gets a bad rap. Scarborough is one of the most eclectic regions of Toronto and it is HUGE!!! Oasis Juice Bar shows just how eclectic it is.  It's a Middle Eastern joint and it is not famous for the juice that they squeeze. What is it famous for you ask?  Well, it's one of the few places left in the city where you and your friends can go and smoke a hookah.  And don't worry, it's perfectly sanitary.  There is one hookah to a table and they give each member of your party an individual, plastic, disposable mouthpiece that is pre-sealed in plastic.  You just remove your mouthpiece when you have puffed enough and then let your friend use his mouthpiece and so on. They have all different kinds of tobacco.  Apple, strawberry, etc and it is a really nice experience. Best to have it with a Turkish coffee.  They are fantastic at this place.  And you can also get a good glass of juice I'm told. The atmosphere is very nice.  The place is not smoky at all, doesn't smell like smoke and is completely ventilated to the teeth. It's a wonderful place if you feel like a new experience and don't wasn't to commit to a pack of cigarettes. http://www.oasisjuicebar.ca/"}
