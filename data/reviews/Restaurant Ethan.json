{"text":"Restaurant Ethan is your run-of-the-mill quick Chinese restaurant with take-out roasted meats. The environment is clean and service was quick and friendly. Unlike some similar places, this restaurant offers clean plates and cutlery. I ordered the BBQ pork and roasted duck with rice. The BBQ pork was tasty and fatty(not the greatest in the world, but it is okay). The duck was equally as good. Side vegetables included bok choi, and sliced carrots and radish. Where they did disappoint me was the rice. Though cooked right, it was cold on the outside edges (like it had been sitting there with a draft for a while). Price-wise, it is very comparable with other restaurants nearby (under 10$). Overall, this place fulfills all the requirement to be a successful Chinese restaurant. However, located in the center of Chinatown where competition is fierce, it is hard to survive in this environment. Also, their take-out service is also very good. Bring home a variety of roasted meats to your family."}
{"text":"Roast duck and rice is quite good. The congee is OK. We also went back today to buy takeout, and the lady at the counter was rude as hell, being impatient in explaining the menu, and really turning me off in wanting to ever come again."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten. The food was on the table in 2 minutes after we ordered which is not necessarily a bad thing, except when the Szechuan shrimp we ordered was just frozen cooked shrimp thrown into a sauce that was loaded with red food coloring and cornflour. Absolutely no trace of any Szechuan flavor. Even food court Chinese places are way better. The only reason I'm guessing is it busy is because it happens to be in the middle of a touristy area. Disgusting!!"}
{"text":"Decent Cantonese food. I had the Shanghai noodle and my friend had the BBQ pork and duck with steamed rice. This was not the first time I was here. Previously, I ordered the Cantonese styled noodle and it was delicious. I think their strong points are in their fried noodles and rice platters. Definitely order the bbq pork/duck if you want to taste genuine cantonese dish. The noodles are very flavorful and savory. Service was swift. Overall a good experience and would come back for more! :)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and ordered four different dishes. Most of the food were just too bland; like the food were all hastily cooked. People at the restaurant seemed unhappy to be serving customers. What a disappointment"}
{"text":"The first two times I went there with my white boyfriend, they only gave us English menus, and hid the all-Chinese one. That kind of turned me off. But they were the only restaurant that sold similar food as Andy and Dobie that is open after 7 pm. So we went there for the third time. I don't know whether it's because they were busy, or that they've made a mistake, we got both versions of the menu. That pleased me a bit.

We have ordered the curry beef rice, BBQ-ed pork and rice, BBQ-ed pork + chicken and rice, and they were pretty good. They're the same owners as Calia, bakery next door, so if you save the paper underneath your plate, you can get a free bun if you purchase $10 worth of buns at Calia! :)"}
{"text":"Food is below average, service is below average. When we pay the bill at the cashier, she made me pay a mandatory 15% tips charged to my bill even there's only 5 people in my family (2 adults and 2 teenagers and 1 kid). But the 15% was hand written beside the total amount and force me to pay. This is totally unacceptable especially this is a just causal fast food cafe. 

What interesting is, after I stepped out, I talked to another Australian family who also paid the bill after me, that Australian family wasn't requested to pay the mandatory 15% tips, but the Chinese owner there only force the Asian (tourist) customers to pay as I wasn't the locals there. 


Never go back there !!! Alert to all tourist and residents there !"}
{"text":"Cold Food, Cold Service.  Charged for food never received, corrected when brought to attention.  Many better choices in chinatown here, would avoid this one.  Unapologetic and unattentive.  For the time we waited, I expected better food.  Will not return."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and we are originally from the States. We came here after exploring Downtown Montreal. We were hungry and decided to eat at this nice-looking restaurant. The cheesy fries were ok and the honeydew milk tea. However, it was not worth the buck because both were small in proportion and we still had to find another restaurant after because we were still hungry. However, not knowing about the customs in Canada and thought that the tip had been paid for, as said on the receipt. This was not the case as this was a provincial tax. However, what stuck out about this restaurant was the rude staff. After coming out of the bathroom, my friend was waiting for me and the cashier had told him that I did not leave a tip. As previously mentioned I thought the receipt indicated that a tip had been given. But the fact that the cashier(not our waiter) had the AUDACITY to ask for a tip infuriated me. 

Tips are supposed to be optional and the cashier never served us in the first place. So why ask someone for a tip for a service you did NOT provide???"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Service is shitty. We repeatedly asked for our drinks and they were looking into it for over an hr. Although we gave 15% tips for their shitty service, they expected us to give them more tips. What a shitty place. Will give 0 star if possible. There's plenty of restaurants in Chinatown, please go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I personally only go to this place to have BBQ pork/Duck and I think everything else on the menu is average.

Couple of things to keep in mind:

1. Don't expect amazing service but the service is quick!
2. They ask for 15% tip."}
{"text":"Party for 1 and they include tip!? Strange to have a place to tip themselves when its serving just 1! 

Food also was mediocre. Chicken congee has a lot of bone in it and very little chicken. 

Service is unfriendly."}
{"text":"I love their BBQ pork dishes and rice dishes. Very affordable, good service, and quick. 
My recommendation is the salt and pepper fried pork chop. Amazingly tender, seasoned well, and a  large portion. The accompanied fried onion and peppers are amazing as well. 

I only wish they had the stir fried tomato and egg. They have the tomato and beef dish that tastes pretty similar. So why not add the egg version?

Their noodles soups are pretty decent as well."}
{"text":"Service is horrendous.  Avoid at all costs!  We ordered two appetizers and four entrees.  One entree came first, then one appetizer.  When we complained to the waiter, he just said sorry.  When we complained to the food server, he said this is a fast restaurant, and that's that.  We asked for a manager, and were told he was not available.  The last appetizer came after we had finished most of the entrees.  Tourist trap, lousy service, and average food."}
{"text":"Cheap and good. 
I went twice and spent about 10$ each time.
I consider it my Hong Kong Canteen in Montreal.

On my first visit, I got the pork, preserved eggs, ginger and scallion congee. pimping hot and tasty. very good. I also got the pork and nappa cabagge dumplings (aka xiao long bao or soup dumplings). I think it was made to order because it tasted fresh, juicy and delicious.
The service was pretty quick. 

On my second visit, i ordered the same dumplings (I love them)!. (6 for $3.50 i think) and a plate of 2 meats (duck and roast pork) with rice and bokchoys. I wish the meats were moistier it was ok though.

The place looks pretty big and clean. It is good for groups.

Presently, one of my go-to place in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Large menu options and quick service, however the food itself was lukewarm at best: some pieces of green pepper, corn, beef, etc. were cold. They do try to cycle as many people as they can, very pushy to get you out as fast as possible. Other than somewhat cold food and pushy wait staff, the food itself would have been good."}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice dumpling spot in Chinatoen and ended up settling for this place after a long walk. The host was very nice and quiet but helpful. The food came out at an average rate. It wasn't the best presentation but it was edible. The food was a little bland but it made us full. 

The WORST and most awful part of this experience was when we went to pay. We walked up to the cashier who was so incredibly rude. She demanded a minimum ten percent tip. We usually leave more, but her rude yelling resulted in exactly ten percent. Tip is optional and should not be forced upon the customers. After that she ended up yelling about something or other but my friend and I just walked out ecause of how offensive she was. If she wasn't there, the full experience would've been much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Pretty bad Chinese food for one in Chinatown. Had the dim sum combo which was too doughy, too salty, or fatty tasting. The service was lousy and to top it off the hand written 15% tip added to bill for a family of 4. Pretty much a tourist trap and I doubt many repeat customers. Pretty much turned me off to Chinese food for the rest of the week."}
{"text":"The food was good. I really enjoyed my dumplings and Dad really enjoyed his curry! We ordered the bubble tea and it was really sweet. The first guy who approached us for your drinks OBVIOUSLY just came back from his smoke break because his hovering smoke cloud almost choked out my cousin. The actual lady who served our table was nice and spoke english well enough. Food was served quickly and hot."}
{"text":"Please do not go here. Aside from the fact that the food was substandard, they \"imposed\" a 15% tip on our bill when the service did not warrant such an amount. Please AVOID!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at this place in China Town while walking from the Plateau to the Old Port.  It was alright. The portions were good (all chinese food place give a lot of food). But I've had much better chicken fried rice before. 

It won't kill you to eat here, but I am sure there are better options."}
{"text":"A satisfying Hong Kong styled meal if you're in the mood for some classics. 
Their portions are generous, the food is consistently cooked and the service is standard for what you'd receive for its value. 
The servers are prompt and food is readied quickly. 
Overall, a good experience. Definitely good value."}
{"text":"I came by for a quick meal of wonton noodles and  har gow.  I ended up getting my food after the table beside me and I was there about 5 minutes previous.  They also got noodles :S

I got my noodles not long after the table beside me.  Then they brought out some food I didn't order.  I got my  har gow and it sucked.  The wrap was way to sticky and mushy.

The noddles were alright.  The meal was ok, slightly more expensive than TO with slightly smaller portions.  The service was spotty but they were at least somewhat friendly...unless you ask for an English menu which happened to the table beside me."}
{"text":"Inside Downtown Montreal - China Town. Great place for quick Chinese style food and BBQ. 2pm-5pm are Hi-Tea Combo Specials which is a meal including a drink for $6.00

They do have take out BBQ items (eg. $8.50/lb Cha Siu BBQ Pork to-go)."}
{"text":"The food was horrible. We went in without checking the ratings. The ratings and reviews are way kinder. The food is horrendous. We ordered Kung Pao, shrimp wonton soup and some dumpings. The food was bland, cold and of absolutely worst quality. Please save your money and your palate. In a word, the food is horrendous."}
{"text":"Ever had fried rice made with over cooked rice? Not good. Flavorless, not a shrimp or egg bits in sight just a bunch of frozen carrot cubes and peas. My nephew's chow mein was ok but on the dry side no sauce but a couple teaspoons of it. This property had seen better days when it was Sun Din lung."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever. The foods are hard as rocks and not digestible. Horrible service. I wish I could give zero star."}
{"text":"Cuisine standard, service très rapide, prix abordable, chaises déchirées et toilette sale. 


Nourriture :
Nous avons pris des calmars frits au sel et poivre, boeuf et brocoli chinois, poulet au curry, riz frits et dumplings et avions partagé. Le riz était trop huileux. J'ai déjà pris du canard laqué qui était un peu sec, mais le goût était bon. Rien d'extraordinaire, mais dans l'ensemble, c'était un bon repas. 

Service: 
Ultra rapide. On est arrivé vers 21h50 et le restaurant fermait la cuisine à 22h30. On a commandé et les plats sont tous arrivés dans les dizaines de minutes. Les pichets d'eau étaient remplis aussitôt vidés.

Ambiance et décor :
La moitié des chaises était due pour les poubelles. Les coussins étaient arrachés. Mais à part le restaurant Orange Rouge, on serait bien déçu d'aller dans un restaurant du quartier chinois pour l'ambiance et le décor. Une amie (un peu snob) trouvait les toilettes trop sales pour y aller.

Ça dépanne, c'était notre troisième choix car on était tanné. on y va quand la plupart des bons restaurants ont fermé la cuisine."}
{"text":"Here is absolutely our favourite roast duck place  because their duck is superb. Plus the butcher he is super friendly unlike in other restaurants in Chinatown."}
{"text":"The worst !!! Dirty and the staff is super rude especially the older Chinese waiter with glasses. Super filthy utensils and the bathroom is gross. Skin on the roast duck is soft. Not crispy at all. Do not come here !!!"}
{"text":"Great place for HK style comfort food to satisfy your cravings. HK style means that this cafe offers various food items such as: rice plates, noodle soups, roasted meats, etc."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a quick meal. We enjoyed it. Busy busy but only couple mins wait time which was awesome!!!
Stop by& try their bbq duck& pork!"}
{"text":"Don't think I'll be coming back here. Although it is affordable the quality of service is non existent. Food tasteless, I guess it taste what it's worth. Worst wonton soup ever. Dumplings just aren't that great :-/."}
{"text":"Noodles tasted really bad, the general tao wasn't that good. The waitress wasn't warm."}
{"text":"We just arrived in town and my husband and I felt like chinese wonton noodles. The waiter had no personality and was not polite at all but that's not unusual for many chinese restaurants we've eaten at but hey... as long as the food is good I don't care. The duck wonton noodle soup was average and not worth writing home about but this was our fault because we didn't read the reviews on yelp before going into this place! We walked around chinatown and looked at their menu and it looked good so we went in and boy do we regret it. As some of the reviewers wrote this place hand writes 20% on the bottom of the bill. Since I speak cantonese I asked them about it. Their answer was that most of their clientele are europeans and they don't tip and their servers can't make a decent living without tips so that's why they hand write it on the tab. I told them that somehow by writing it on the ticket and not posting it on the menu or on the door seems to me illegal? I know this would not happen in the United States where I am from if it is not posted somewhere. Most of the restaurants that I've been to in the States will only have a mandatory tip if there are more than 6 people or more per table and it would be written somewhere on the menu. I also reminded them that tipping is for the service and it's not like our waiter went out of his way to be nice to us or did anything above and beyond to deserve 20% tip. The cashier crossed off the 20% tip off our check and after we paid our bill we did leave a 10% tip. Back home we normally tip 20% for good service and 15% for average service so since our waiter didn't give much of any service except take our order and deliver it ( never came back to check on us or refill our water glasses ) so we decided 10% was sufficient.
NO we will never go back and hopefully all YELP people who reads this hopefully will head our advice."}
{"text":"Awful customer service by one of our waiters.  Second waiter was quite nice, but it really sucked being in the first guy's presence. 

Pretty good prices, not very high.   

Flies openly swarmed the restaurant tables and there wasn't much effort made in controlling 'em (EEK!!!).  

We ordered their shrimp rice roll, satay beef noodle soup, chicken curry over white rice and har gao.  Definitely liked the shrimp rice roll flavoring a lot and chicken curry taste was good too.  Taste of food is slightly milder than other Chinese restaurants and this is very likely due to them NOT using MSG, but the food was definitely quite enjoyable!  

Dim sum takes longer to make, but everything else on the menu is brought out lickety-split.  Honestly, if it weren't for the attitude of the one waiter and the flies, this would've gotten a solid 3.5 based on price and food quality alone."}
{"text":"It's sad when roast duck turns out to be dry duck.

Even sadder when the won ton soup has the flavor of hot water.

This place, chosen by my guest, was a horrible find.

The sad part is that even though this was lacking in flavor, we couldn't find any better Chinese BBQ place.

Hence the reluctant 3 stars."}
{"text":"The place offers has a very large menu with lots of choices of food and soft drinks(bubbleteas). Their beijing ducks is one of the best in Montreal, and their chatsu is very good. The only downside of this place is the service, one of the waitress was kinda rude. When I asked to get the rest of my food to go she threw the plastic container on the table and told my friends and I to pack it ourselves. Definitely didn't deserve any tips, and once we left a very minimal tip for her she complained about why we not giving her more tips. Well, maybe if she wasn't rude she would receive a $10 tip instead of $1."}
{"text":"Just a tad bit disappointed by this restaurant. Considering it's in the heart of Chinatown I expected a bit more. We came as a large group we ordered a variety of things.

I tried the double BBQ with crispy pork and roast pork. The meats were just okay. The roast pork was overly fatty and not quite right. The crispy pork just didn't have the right texture and the skin wasn't as thick and crispy as it should have been. 

We tried the Hong Kong style french toast and it was just alright...

The rest of our group was lukewarm about the food but some of us were just happy to have something Asian since we hadn't had any in a while.

The prices are reasonable and the food came quickly. Those would be the pros. But other than that, I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I only ordered a bubble tea to go.

But the place seemed like expediting at a good pace a large variety of dishes. The lacquered duck looked good.

The prices point seemed reasonable."}
{"text":"It was first time a restaurant put 15% tips on the bill and forced the guest to pay, not only rude but disgusting. Food wasn't so good and the attitude was unacceptable. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Chinatown in Montreal is small (1 - no matter where in the world we go, my mom ALWAYS has to have rice at least once a day 2- they have the fruits my family travels to Canada for) and this is a reliable resource for good, cheap roast pork/duck over rice. Their beef pan fried noodles are not great (as in, not something I would order again). Their wonton noodle soup is pretty good: I got it both times we came here. General Tso'c chicken was pretty good: again, something my family ordered both times we came.

Overall, nothing crazy and nothing that's a must see in Montreal. The service is OK (if you get a waiter that speaks English well, then the service is good, if not, the inability to effectively communicate causes some frustration. The food comes out fast, so if you're starving, this is a good place to go. Their bubble tea is alright: stops a craving, but it's not great. They do get brownie points for giving baby bochoy with everything and for the HUGE food portions."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised that their soup noodles were crunchy, but unfortunately it lacked taste and all the other dishes we order were just as expected - subpar, as this isn't Toronto or Hong Kong."}
{"text":"Pretty clean, new, fresh Cantonese style restaurant in Chinatown. I'm not too crazy about Chinatown restaurants for my own reasons, but this particular place is not too bad. The service was ok but they kept bringing us orders from different tables. I think it was a bit disorganized their system maybe. But what I ordered was pretty good. I had a char siu (sp?) very popular Cantonese dish which is bbq pork with rice and some sort of sauce...I should find out what that sauce is because it's pretty darn good. I take one star off because I asked for egg with my bbq pork dish, but what they did is give my friend 2 eggs (he had the same dish as me) and just took off his other egg and transferred it to my plate. Okay....ANYWAY, I liked the portion size. Not too much and not too little. The bbq pork was sweet but tasty according to my standards of char siu. (it might not be too high I haven't eaten too many char siu). The payment part was even stranger because they did not know what to do since we wanted to pay separate. Like I said, a bit disorganized of a system on their part. Otherwise, not bad, not bad. But not great either."}
{"text":"J'ai toujours été sceptique sur la rapidité presque impossible du service commande/réception des plats mais on a toujours été très bien accueilli et le général tao est quand même très bon! La portion que tu reçois pour le prix (vraiment très bas!) est plus que satisfaisant."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre and the service we had was horrible. I dont know if the waiter still works there, but once I went there to eat, and as soon as I entered the restaurant, a waiter with very short hair came to tell me to get out of the way because I was \"bothering their business\" ."}
{"text":"I'm somewhat guilty of using this site only when I feel that I have been terribly abused by a restaurant and this review will not be pretty.

The food which we were served was absolutely bland and the dishes were literally thrown at our table. I cannot even try to describe how horrible the service was that Sunday. I was embarrassed and disappointed with myself for having brought my mother to eat here.

If that were not enough they have the nerve to add on 15% service to the bill. If it were not for the fact that I did not want to annoy my mother with this I would never have paid the extra 15% and fought them as I do not believe that they have any right to do this.

IF THIS REVIEW CAN STOP EVEN JUST ONE PERSON FROM ENTERING THIS HELL HOLE THEN MY JOB IS DONE.

Seriously ... I love little hole in the wall restaurants and I have eaten in the best of them all over the world but please do yourself a favour and not waste your time at this place."}
{"text":"Came by for breakfast right when it opened before the trip back to Toronto. They had breakfast specials for $5.25.  We chose the soup noodle + tea and the congee + fried noodle.  The portions were big (bigger than the Toronto standard) and was really delicious.  

Service was nice (we spoke chinese).  Of course this isn't a 5 star restaurant, so you might need to ask for water refills if needed.

Would visit again if I'm back in montreal.  It was a nice and friendly environment."}
{"text":"It's such a terrible service. Especially, the old waitress who served at night, she was rude.
It was the worst service, so I tipped a little. However, that old waitress came to tell us to give more tips. She won't let us go if we didn't give her more tip.I'll never ever go there again
You can tell your friends or your family not to go there. Otherwise, you'll be regret."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves the BEST milk tea in Montreal. It's is à Hong style milk tea that could be serve hot or cold. The drink has a strong tea flavour and is packed with caffeine. I must admit that I never ate at the restaurant and always took the milk tea to go, but the tea is definitely worth the stop every time."}
{"text":"Not a bad restaurant in Chinatown. We ordered both the beef chow fun and chicken with vegetables dishes and both were pretty good. The restaurant could use some improvement in their service as we had to get the staff attention for both ordering and getting our water refilled. Otherwise the food came out pretty fast and we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"They have good combo deals for table for 2, 3, or 4. Dishes seem to have been thrown together without much care. Sometimes they put the tip in the bill already. The trick is to go up the counter and pay. Then choose your choice of tip through their card machine."}
{"text":"Why is this restaurant still exist?
We are from NYC and we visited Montreal with our kids. We stopped by Chinatown and just wanted an easy lunch. Waiter told us to sit inside with our stroller, so we walked in with our baby sleeping in the stoller. But this woman started talking loud at us saying we cannot sit in because our stoller takes up space. But there were plenty of rooms and there were only a few groups eating there. We even saw another family there with the same sized stroller. So we asked where should we sit? She said NOWHERE. So we said then we will just leave, and she said SURE. WTF of customer service is that? We asked why other family can have their stroller in here but not us? She said oh because their table is bigger. Wow, woman, you should be ashamed of your attitude and personality and everything. DONT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE AND RUIN YOUR DAY."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast;  staff harried to the point of short temperedness, aggressive cashier. Having said that, the food arrived piping hot and quickly, was quite good, (I had the chicken in yellow curry sauce) very inexpensive, and for a change came with enough rice to sop up the sauce. I've always found that there is never enough rice to go with a dish at Chinese restaurants. Perhaps I'm just a rice hog, in which case, oink, oink. Must say, even with a good tip, my meal was only $9.00! Many dishes are only $6.95, $1.00 extra with coffee or tea.  Can't bitch!"}
{"text":"While browsing through small China Town of Montreal, I realize that there are not as many Chinese Restaurant as Vietnamese Restaurant, maybe this should be Vietnam/China Town instead.  Anyhow, I was craving for Chinese Food and end up at Ethan.  

We ordered General Tao Chicken with rice, Chinese BBQ Duck, hot and sour soup and Chow Fun.  The food came out very quick and still hot.  

General Tao Chicken was nice and crispy-good
CHinese BBQ Duck-  nice and seasoned-good
hot and sour soup - ok
Chow Fun Beef- good

Bill came out just under $30 and the portion was big, we end up taking some to go.  If you are looking for some Authentic Cantonese Food, you should try this place."}
{"text":"I was craving salt and pepper shrimps and my Chinese friend wanted a giant bowl of pho. However, we both had a short lunch break and we didn't want to go to a food court (where we usually have lunch) for Chinese food. Hence, she suggested we go there. 

I'll be clear about one thing: Service is not very good. Our waiter was particularly impatient. But thank goodness the food is good (yet not mind blowing). The salt and pepper shrimps came with a large bowl of rice and bok choy. The service was ridiculously fast and the price was the best: $7.50! I'm always a fan of full meals for less than $10. 

So to sum up: The food was better than in a food court, it was almost as fast as in a food court and the price was cheaper than in a food court. Only thing that isn't amazing is the service. But if you need a quick and cheap lunch, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"NOTE: This is for takeout only
I normally go to Epicerie Lam Kee for my BBQ Pork and Roast Pork, but I went there after work one day and they ran out.  So I passed by this place and saw that they also sold \"take out\".  The BBQ Pork and Roast Pork were excellent!  I'd say probably better than Epicerie Lam Kee. I'll probably go here from now on.
By the way, to all the people complaining about \"rude\" behavior of the wait staff - you just don't understand Chinese culture. In other words, what may be considered rude to the western world, is considered normal behavior in the chinese culture. So, if you want smiling, whimsical waiters, then you should probably stick to the more westernized chinese restaurants. But if you want authentic chinese food, then you should also expect authentic chinese behavior and realize that it is not anything personal. It's just the way it is. :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and the waiter who took our order didn't write down our order and messed up! They brought out everything but one dish. The last dish that was suppose to come was a char siu and duck soup noodle dish and what came was a rice plate with char siu and duck. So we corrected the order thinking it was no biggie. The waiters were a$$es! Corrected them multiple times and waited for the right dish to come. After 20 plus minutes, still they didn't do anything and didn't bring out the right order!! They all were avoiding eye contact and acted like nothing was wrong. FINALLY, after my last and final time telling them I will had one more dish, they brought me out my soup noodles. I was livid. After paying the bill I didn't want to leave tip. So I paid my bill and started to exit and the cashier actually chased after me telling me I didn't pay tip and that minimum I had to tip was $3!!! What the heck! Awful, poor, rude and unprofessional service with mediocre food. DO NOT COME HERE!"}
{"text":"Le service était très rapide et courtois, mais la nourriture était fade et de mauvaise qualité. Le canard était sans goût, très osseux et contenant peu de viande. Les bok choy avaient un goût douteux et le riz insipide était le seul truc passable du repas. Nous avons vivement regretté notre choix."}
{"text":"This is your average Chinese restaurant if you are looking for BBQ styled meat. I ordered the BBQ pork and duck on rice with a large coffee/milk tea. Portion was huge for me. Came with the two type of meat, lightly cooked lettuce, pickled veggies, rice and dipping sauce. The BBQ pork was on the drier side which was difficult to eat. Duck was good, again nothing special. The drink came in a to go cup which was great, and it tasted really good! I would come back for the drink but not for the food."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre - the dumplings were too doughy and bland. The Xiao long bao was not soupy or tasty at all.. The pan fried dumplings were a bit burnt and bitter. The fried calamari was OK - there are better places along the street to try out instead"}
{"text":"Fast good service and good food. Menu in English has 144 food options but the base is always the same rice,noodles,..I liked the place.could see mostly Chinese  eating there so I would go again."}
{"text":"Ethan is definitely not the best asian in the city - by any stretch of the imagination - but their congee is pretty darn good and they happen to be one of the rare spots in Mtl that make it. So if ever congee is what you're in the mood for, Ethan's the place for you!"}
{"text":"The rice tastes bad ,I do not know why,waiters and waitress are not warm,no wifi providing,will not eat again."}
{"text":"CONGEE CONGEE CONGEE!

I am a self-professed congee lover, especially with the century egg in it. There I said it. It's my go-to comfort food, and I will say that Ethan does congee well! You might be wondering what the difference is with other places. So here goes:

1) Good amount of ginger slivers
2) Nice consistency: not too thin, not to thick
3) Good ratio of congee to side ingredients (ex. century egg)
4) Always has chinese donuts available to go with it

When I was child I knew I could spot a shop that served congee by whats hanging in the window. (The rack of bbq pork, crispy pork thing, bbq duck) and the first time I saw Ethan, I saw this, and it was congee love at first sight. :)"}
{"text":"So this place has some pretty crappy reviews. Not sure why because it is what it is- a simple spot to grab some good Chinese in a hurry. I was in Montreal with a friend who went to China years ago and has been pining for some vinegar-soy soup sauce and lo and behold, they had it on the tables. Good omen #1.

BBQ Pork was good. The wonton soup and pork dumpling soups were both great and so was the kid's dish we got (noodles, soy sauce and onions). Service is kind of spotty. Décor is a bit on the well worn end of things- but that's much of Montreal so no use in complaining about that. Lots of people and fun, fast atmosphere. Recommend 100%"}
{"text":"Had the roast duck on rice, very nice! Reasonably priced and very tasty! Also their coconut bubble tea is delicious!"}
{"text":"J'ai toujours voulu essayé ce restaurant qui semble toujours bondé... mais quelle déception!

À notre arrivée la serveuse nous informe qu'il ne reste plus aucun wonton (bouh!) Nous étions en train de commander quand nous avons hésiter pour un de nos choix. À ce moment là, une autre serveuse a surgi est nous a dit d'un ton très rude qu'il faudrait se décider maintenant puisque la cuisine allait fermer.

Nous avons commandé une entrée de crevette enroulé dans une pâte de riz ( pâte trop collante et sauce soya trop surette) le riz avec canard et porc bbq ( canard partie osseuse seulement) et des nouille avec boeuf braisé qui, heureusement, étaient bonnes.

Le service laisse à désirer surtout quand vous arrivez proche de l'heure de la fermeture ( nous avions 50 minutes...). une des serveuses criait à tout bout de champ \"ok we're close\" à son staff dans la cuisine que je me sentais mal à l'aise d'être dans le restaurant. Une fois que nous avions fini, nous avons fait signe à la serveuse pour qu'elle nous apporte une boîte pour emporter. Au lieu de venir nous voir elle nous crie\"payez à la caisse\" 

Petits prix oui mais il y a des places beaucoup meilleures au Chinatown. C'est clairement un attrape touriste :("}
{"text":"Has to be by far the worst restaurant in Chinatown for food and service. Ordered roast pork and duck and it had to be the lowest quality BBQ meat. A few pieces of very dried up roast duck and fat roast pork and a few pickled vegetable and rice. The meat is not fresh and has no taste. The rice place was just put on the table and the waiter not once came by to offer any more water. Last time I'll am eating at this place!!!!"}
{"text":"The old lady serving here is so mean. The food is so-so. The only people eating here are tourist and we are one of them. Dont go to this place"}
{"text":"Okay food, disorganized service.  There are probably better choices in the immediate area.  There were mistakes in our order (shrimp instead of pork dumplings for example), and there was a slight feeling of chaos in the service.  Portions were good, but this place has nothing special going for it so I would recommend passing it by."}
{"text":"This is not a fancy restaurant. I repeat. It is not a fancy restaurant. 

What it is... it is a casual restaurant where you order your comfort food or whatever you feel like having, they have it, they will serve it to you quickly.  There is no 5 stars treatment, you come in, eat and go. 

I wanted some congee at 10 pm at night. Since the closing time was near, they ran out of the usual dim sum food. The waiter suggested I I ordered some fried rice or noodle soup, I couldnt resist so I did. I ordered the large bbq duck with wonton noodle soup.  It was delicious and satisfying.  

Overall, I think the service was pretty good. It has the nice casual outgoing vibe I was looking was and the price is pretty good. 

If you all want to have a fancy time, you can go to Maxim Oriental or the crystal restaurant. This place has its purpose."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much as I stepped into Restaurant Ethan, but I ended up being surprised by how authentic Hong Kong their food was. Certainly was not something I expected from a restaurant in Montreal.

First off, I must give a disclaimer that authentic food is not everybody's cup of tea. In fact, you'll probably find it rather weird unless you've lived in Hong Kong (or visited for a long duration). Otherwise, Restaurant Ethan will stir up a little sense of that nostalgia. 

Do not expect the staff to be friendly. They expect you to eat, pay, and leave in an \"efficient\" manner, much like many of the other restaurants in Chinatown. They also do not speak a word of French."}
{"text":"This was hands down the worst Chinese restaurant I have been unfortunate enough to experience. Avoid at all costs. The meat in their fried buns was a mysterious conglomeration of grey/brown chunks. Their general tao chicken were fried pieces of dough doused in sauce without much chicken. Their Xiao long bao's had zero juice inside and its' dough was stale and hard. I wouldn't eat here again if I were paid to do so."}
{"text":"very blah resto... hong kong style bbq joint but the quality was mediocre at best... bbq pork was decent, riceflour roll with shrimp was crap... (2 rolls, thick large wrapper and only 2 shrimp... sauce was tasteless) xia long bao were all stuck together which defeated the purpose of getting them and the 2 bowls of noodles were nothing special at all....  skip this one... theres other options nearby..."}
{"text":"This is a tourist trap.  If you're  lucky  enough to read this before stepping in, don't .  The service is atrocious.  I received practically no service after the food is casually dropped  off.  Food was terribly low quality, salty, and caters to Western palates.   I regret  giving this place a chance.  On top of it all, lady in the front was rude and pushy when I went to pay the bill."}
{"text":"I came here for Chinese dinner on a Monday in June. It's around the corner from Holiday inn express hotel and it was raining. We walked around and I liked the menu. The staff speak mandarin, English and Cantonese. The menu is Cantonese just like in LA. The beef brisket noodles soup was flavorful with fatty brisket and lettuce.  We also ordered sweet and sour pork was good too and saucy. The dim sum beef noodle roll melt in my mouth. Everything was well worth it. Just pay at the counter. Good on refills."}
{"text":"Service rapide, restaurant propre, prix très raisonnable et la nourriture est bonne"}
{"text":"i would come back. we got half a duck ($14), a large bowl of crab and fish maw soup ($7.50) and vegetables stir fried with beef ($14) and 2 vegetarian spring rolls ($3). The prices are alright for typical chinese food. the taste was pretty standard, you really couldnt mess it up. the soup was a bit bland though, could use more flavour but we added in vinegar and black pepper and it tasted alright, the spring rolls had a bit of a funny taste to it but it wasnt noticeable, the duck was really yummy! we had the duck with rice. the beef and vegetable was good as well. everything came out really quick and the staff were super friendly and nice. they charge tip already in the bill so you dont need to tip them."}
{"text":"It's become a place we routinely hit for lunch when in Montreal.  It's not a place that makes my planning as a \"must eat here\" place when in town, but it's a decent option that I'm happy to return to.

The place is very casual, and an odd mix of dine in restaurant and cooked birds hanging in the window for by the pound purchase.  The food is good, and the lunch specials are very well priced.  Seating can be tight."}
{"text":"Its a solid place to go for cheap and cheerful Chinese food. Some items off the menu are weird (like the hamburgers and milky dessert drinks), but hey that's Chinatown for you! Avoid ordering the tea as it comes in plastic cups that often smell like bleach. I like the steamed guylan and the sweet and sour soup."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a quick bite! Along with a variety of Cantonese dishes, they also serve BBQ plates such as roast duck and pork. Highly recommend the $5.99 special from 3:30 pm - 5:00 pm where you get a free drink and small snack! You can even order the red bean ice milk shake which is a stellar deal. Caution you that their service is not the best and renovations would be nice but what can you say to good and cheap Chinese food in the middle of Chinatown?"}
{"text":"the first time I went to this place it was opening day and as chaotic as the place was, the food was honestly WONDERFUL!!!!
That was then. This time, the food was NOT great at all. Actually let me re-phrase, the peanutbutter dumplings entree was fantastic!! the main dishes were horrible. The \"broth\" in the chicken chow mein was a thick gloppy sauce (which I couldn't stomach to eat) and instead of chicken, I got an assortment of meats... chicken, shrimp, beef and duck... which isn't on mentioned in the discription on the menu. THe chicken fried rice has boiled rice, not fried and it pasty and tasteless.. I was NOT pleased.
The only reason why this place gets 2 stars is because the peanut butter dumplings were wonderful."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, we were regret to come here for dinner. From outside the restaurant was very attractive as it served tradition Cantonese dishes like wonton noodle soup and various BBQ dishes. For those liked us who have been gone for awhile and craved for Cantonese food, we thought this must be the place. Wrong, not only the food was so bad, the service was terrible. We were greet with rude and impatient waitress. We have ordered BBQ pork and soy sauce chicken. What we got was fatty BBQ pork and drumstick. For beef noodle, the brisket was tough and the noodle was soggy. I suggest you not trying this restaurant. There are better Chinese foods around this area."}
{"text":"While exploring Montreal's Chinatown, I ducked into Restaurant Ethan for some lunch.

I'll stay this to start - I've been to a lot of Chinese restaurants. I've come to be pretty carefree about the conditions of these restaurants - plain, drab, and in need of a cleaning. But walking into Restaurant Ethan, I couldn't help but notice the large amounts of dust that were on top of the picture frames hanging on the wall. Worse than anything I have seen. This immediately gave me a bad impression of the place.

The service was quick and friendly and my food arrived soon after I ordered. The steamed dumplings came first and they were rather tasty.  I love when I bite into a dumpling and get juicy pop of flavor in my mouth - these dumplings delivered just that. 

The beef satay ramen arrived next.  I was immediately disappointed on appearance alone - it was not a traditional ramen, but rather more of a pho soup with thick ramen noodles, beef, and large pieces of onions.  The broth was decent but the noodles were too thick and overcooked.  I slurped up the whole bowl of broth but left a large portion of noodles and onions, all while wishing I had more dumplings.

I wanted to give this restaurant a two star review because of the tasty dumplings and good service, but I could not ignore the overall filthiness of the place.  One star it is."}
{"text":"Have been here for several times. Years ago being poor as student, I'd grab a cheap meal with my friends. I can remember some good taste here.  But recently I noticed the service is not friendly and the food always disappointed me. 

Today I had a rice combo with one dollar hot drink. The milk tea is the worst ever. The rice was dry. The dish was in a weird flavour. How come the black pepper beef has vinegar in it? 

The only thing I would order now is the shrimp wonton noodle. For the drink, hot lemon tea is hong kong style. You may like it if you like sour. The dessert I recommend mango snow ice. Sometimes the fruit can be not fresh -_-#

One star up for the old times."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS RESTAURANT.
Worst service.
Waitress literally asked us to leave because she didn't want our stroller in the restaurant with our baby sleeping in it, while there was plenty of room and only a few groups eating in there. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Craving for Chinese food my on my way to Montreal, and was surprised to find out the hotel is located next to the Chinatown. This place is ok, fast service and average food"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch...Was seated quickly, given a menu, a glass of water and was able to place my order within minutes of arriving as my waiter was attentive to his tables... This is quite a change from my other experience in Chinatown on this visit to Montreal... Ordered BBQ Pork on Rice and a large Mango Bubble Tea...The waiter put a plate on the table with fork and knife without any prompting.... Not that I need a fork and knife, I am very adept with chopsticks, but a nice touch just the same...Food was promptly served, excellent pork, with pickled onion and broccoli to go along with the rice... The pork was a little fatty compared to some of the places I eat at in Toronto but this is Montreal after all.... Clean restaurant with good service and reasonable pricing..."}
{"text":"avoid,. We went because they accepted credit card and the menu pictures posted outside looked delicious. The food is bland and flavorless."}

{"text":"Super resto sur la rue piétonnière de quartier chinois. Le canard bbq chinois juste trop Miam à conseiller. Belle ambiance de resto chinois, services très rapide. 395/10"}
{"text":"Terrible, do not go here.
After a few meals of heavy french food and high prices, we wandered over to chinatown for some cheap food we thought would be authentic.

We ordered shrimp dumplings that were inedible. I spit them out. They tasted super fishy and not fresh. My friend had greens with oyster sauce which had remnants of a noodle dish in them. 

We did not eat the food and promptly left. If you have ever had decent chinese then you should not go here!"}
{"text":"Food was alright, but the staff are simply impossible. Waitress that waited our table screamed at patrons when they said that they receive what they ordered. She then followed by yelling some more and telling them to never come back. Same waitress took it upon herself to dictate the amount I would tip her and wrote it on the receipt. Th cashier put that amount in the cash register, at which point I said that it is not the amount I choose to tip. Very bad experience. Don't go there."}
{"text":"This is not a fast food restaurant, they dont charge like a fast food restaurant but they sure act like it is one.
We went it since we saw it is full, which usually means good food or fresh food (due to the demand). We ordered a soup, appetizers and main courses they ALL came Together!.  The food was ok not amazing, very greasy the only plus was that the portions were not small. At the end you need to go pay at the counter (again not a very restaurant feeling). Not sure if I will come here again."}
{"text":"Food was below average for a Cantonese restaurant.  Tried the roasted duck over steamed rice.  The duck's skin was soggy and not crispy.  The duck was really skinny and there wasn't much meat.  Also had an order of their xiao long bao which was not very good.  They don't even give you a spoon and ginger to properly eat it.  Good thing it was only $3.50.  The reason for the low rating was primarily due to the service.  We were quick to be seated, but to get a menu and place an order took forever.  You have to ask for everything.  They had 10 people working and the place wasn't even full.  One of very few places where I left pennies as gratuity and felt it was deservingly so."}
{"text":"Les rouleau. Impériaux et dumpligs sont très bons, intérieur propre et personnel sympathique."}
{"text":"Mediocre Chinese food. Wan ton noodle soup served with lettuce! Wan ton had little flavor."}
{"text":"Terrible place. Rude staff and terrible food. I usually don't give a one star but the way that I saw the staff tell at customers, I was appalled. Stay away from here. They even had the balls to complain about their tip."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials -- soup, eggroll and entree for $7.50. It's hard to go wrong. Portions are more than adequate for one, especially the rice!

Not too much on the atmosphere, but if it's just a quick lunch in Chinatown you want then this is the place.  Don't expect too much from the servers, as a prior reviewer put it."}
{"text":"If you have children don't go to this restaurant, they are pretty nasty and discriminatory. Also the restaurant is very disgusting in terms of cleanliness."}
