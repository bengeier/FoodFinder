{"text":"Really enjoyed my first visit. I will spend my money here again. I had the ribs, crab soup, house cut chips w/ pimento cheese, sweet potato mash and salad. Everything was VERY good. I will be going back and bringing friends and family with me."}
{"text":"I ate here tonight and had a great experience. I called the restaurant at about 6pm and they said they currently had a 45 minute wait and would put us on the list. We showed up at 6:45pm, told the hostess who we were, and were seated within a minute.   Our waitress was very prompt with service throughout the entire dinner.   Our food was great. My wife had the sirloin, ordered it medium rare and it came out Medium rare. I wouldn't say the steak was the best in my life, but it was very good. I ordered the Cajun pasta. It tasted great and was a huge portion.   I'm sure the restaurant still has some kinks to work out, but I was very pleased tonight."}
{"text":"It's hard to sum up my feelings about this place. \"Meh\" seems to be the closest description. In fact, that was the exact response when I asked my boyfriend how his french onion soup was.   Let's start at the beginning. The Mill opened a few months ago in that big brick building where the old Fishbone Grill used to be. When you walk in you can see that they didn't do much remodeling, but they didn't need to. The exposed wood rafters, stained concrete floor, and low brick dividing walls leftover from Fishbone fit perfectly into the mill house/country vintage chic vibe they were going for. The atmosphere was nice, subtle, and infused with some softer classic rock. The atmosphere isn't as important as the food, and unfortunately in this case the food did not quite compare.  We had crab dip, french onion soup, and fettuccine alfredo, which we got in that order and in a timely fashion. The crab dip was good, with a nice layer of melty pepper jack cheese that lent just the right amount of spice to an otherwise average dip. The aforementioned \"meh\" french onion soup came alongside my salad, a mixture of greens (no brown iceburg here) with a disappointing honey mustard dressing. The soup itself was \"fine, but like they pulled it off before it was done cooking\", lacking the deep, stewed-for-days flavor that makes a fantastic french onion soup. The alfredo was fine. Thick, creamy, a little too much pepper an not enough garlic, but a generous portion for nine dollars. We split it and still ended up taking half home.  Would I recommend The Mill? Sure. There's something for everyone, and the service, atmosphere, and beer, can probably make up for the mediocre food."}
{"text":"What a great new place!  Went here with my boyfriend on a Monday evening & it was nice that the place wasn't so packed (we were seated quickly).  I wasn't particularly hungry so I ordered the she crab soup, and my boyfriend ordered the grilled chicken burger/sandwich.  We also ordered the crap dip as an appetizer, and let me tell you... Amazing! It has a slight sweetness to it, and we devoured the whole thing ( even though I thought I wasn't hungry...HAH).  We got our main meals, and my boyfriend LOVED his grilled chicken burger/sandwich. There was a sweetness to the mayonnaise on it...almost like an aioli. The pub chips that came with were also yummy.  My she crab soup was delish, and if I hadn't already been full I would've eaten the whole dang thing. It was sweet, but had a little kick to it as well.  The service was friendly & fast...so ad that to the amazing food...we will definitely be coming back.  I hope this new little gem sticks around, Fort mill needs more places like this!  P.S. prices were great for the amount of food you got. No complaints at all!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, and was glad to see the place has improved from the early reviews. Their craft beer selection is by far the best in the area, and very reasonable pint prices.  I had dinner there twice with my family, and each time the service was fast and efficient. I had the Cajun Pasta and my wife had the ravioli, and they both were delicious. They also make all their salad dressings from scratch. Their kids menu is great for our kids. I would like to see more seasonal beer choices and higher gravity beers on draft, but for now they seem to be on the right track."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. The service in the bar section was awful because the restaurant was understaffed and to add to the poor service the food quality was inexcusable as it was overcooked and bland. We ordered calamari which I did not taste, sliders which were tiny pieces of crumbly dry meat on a bland bun. No sauce or garnish whatsoever. The sliders were served with about 8 fries and no condiments. We asked for ranch dressing sides upon ordering and didn't get it until 3o minutes later after having to ask several times. I ordered the fettuccini and it was also bland. It was served with a side salad that was prepped and stuck in a refrigerator who knows how long before being served. I could tell because it was all dried out and shriveled. I had to literally wait 25 minutes to get silverware AFTER my salad arrived at the table. It took forever in between drinks. We asked for Gran Marnier to be added to our margaritas and the waitress didn't even know what it was. Honestly this place needs more staff and better food to avoid an epic failure. The ONLY good things about this place is the decor was pretty cool and the musician performing live was actually pretty darn good. Forget getting a buzz though because it took so long between drinks. All in all this experience was extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"Food was good, beer selection was decent. I was surprised they had no craft beer on tap from any South Carolina breweries though. The biggest issue with this place was the service. Many of the servers and hostess staff seem extremely young and inexperienced. Just my two cents."}
{"text":"Arrived late on a Thursday evening around 9:00 to grab appetizers and drinks with some friends. Quickly realized that the wait staff was not happy to see us.  We grabbed a bar table and waited about ten minutes until someone finally walked By and threw menus on the table. The rest Of the experience pretty much followed suit.  They need some better help."}
{"text":"The beer was good. Food not so much. Raspberry vinegarette tasted like wasabi. My other ordered the Cajun pasta, do yourself a favor don't order it. It's like six pounds of thick butter and nastiness. I ordered the Mediterranean chicken but was brought shrimp skewers. All in all, the spinach was pretty good. I can't say I'll return for more."}
{"text":"Went for the second time this weekend. They were on a wait but we got seats at the bar and ordered there. The beer was fresh, bar service was friendly and prompt.  As a vegetarian I am always a bit apprehensive about trying new places but The Mill has a great selection of veggie friendly items. I got the portabella burger that was perfectly cooked and served on toasted brioche. The saut√©ed spinach was cooked to perfection.  My husband got the Cajun penne, which came out hot and saucy and had a lot of spicy flavor.  Given he was trained as a chef he can be hard to impress but he already plans to order it again!"}
{"text":"The mill is great.  The reviews here are mostly out of date.  The food is very fresh and we have always had great service.  I think things have improved a lot since they first opened.  Great craft beers and their burgers are awesome."}
{"text":"The service was good and the food was good for pub style. We almost didn't go in because the lot was full, but there is plenty of space inside. They are still training and I'm sure they will get better as they ramp up to full service."}
{"text":"We were here on Monday night at 8:30.  They have 20+ ppl at the regular dining table, 20+ ppl at the bar.   We were seated at the table. My husband ordered rib cooked med rare with spinach, and I ordered a pasta. The paste's portion is huge!! I could take a large togo box for tomorrow lunch & dinner.  The flavor tasted a little bit flat, probably need to add some salt or garlic in it.  My husband's rib is AWESOME++. Flavor, texture, portion, looking, everything is perfect! Actually, I would change my favorite steakhouse from outback to THE MILL! We had some draft beer too. They have $5 for 4 samplings, each on is about 4-5oz. The regular size draft is from $4.  Not bad at all to taste different beers at this reasonable price.  These draft are all over $7 for each one in Charlotte. It is a very nice place to hang out with families. Because their dining tables are separately from the bar, the music is also not too loud.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I ate there last night. It was better than when we tried to go when they first opened - too crowded, not enough wait staff . I had the rib eye steak it was so so. The potatoes was just butter and some garlic, nothing to write home about. Will go again try something different, to get my final opinion of this place"}
{"text":"We thought we would give this place a try. It was Monday at 6 PM and the place was half-empty. We quickly learned that the wait was half an hour even though the majority of the tables were empty. After half an hour we were seated and the waitress made a comment about them being out of dishes.   My wife had the spinach pasta and she thought it was really good. I had the Chicken Alfredo which was drowning in Alfredo sauce and lacked any kind of bread stick to go with it, was very messy but good. Our young one had the buttered noodles and she thought they were fine.   My overall opinion is that this restaurant needs some serious fixing before they are ready for prime time. Don't go in thinking that the wait times actually are on a sliding scale. It appears that when they say half an hour they call you in half an hour even if there isn't wait staff available to help you."}
{"text":"Ok so I was one of those that came in here early, service and food left a lot to be desired. The owner cleaned house after opening and what a difference!!  Tonight I must admit the meal was delicious! Nothing complicated--Mediterranean chicken and my shrimp salad. Drinks perfectly mixed and service that felt \"big city\"! Nice comeback!! We will be back!   Belinda, our waitress was outstanding!! Come see her on Saturdays--college football!"}
{"text":"This is right around the corner from the fella's house, and we'd been eyeballing it - and the Yelp reviews - for months. We could never muster up the energy to try it out til the Friday before Labor Day when we begrudgingly visited for an early dinner.  Much to our surprise, it wasn't half bad. Maybe it depends on the day and time you visit? We were seated promptly, and our waitress was friendly. I ordered the spinach salad with chicken, and the fella got the blackened tilapia sandwich with veggies. We were both pleasantly surprised.  I never went when it was Fishbone, but the inside is huge - bar on one side, restaurant on the other - and it feels like any nondescript chain restaurant. Their beer list was also surprisingly diverse with a few craft beers thrown in there.  The one oddity that stood out was that they have a 7 oz filet on the menu for $23... does anyone actually order that here? It didn't feel like a steak place, and it certainly didn't feel like a $23 steak place.  Overall, I'm glad we went, and I'd try it again just to see if they've finally gotten their footing."}
{"text":"Great ribs... I had a 1/2 rack and it was more than enough food and much better than some other \"big name\" BBQ places that I won't mention the names of.   Great local beers on-tap (Foothills, Noda) to boot!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been several times since their opening.  The prices are very good compared to most places.  The burgers won't disappoint, especially if you decide to build your own with a large variety of selections to top.  Customer service has always been good although it always seems only about 1/3 full when we go.  It beats any chain restaurant as the selection is varied and they have put their own stamp on the dishes.  Good causal choice for family dining or a start to the night out with friends."}
{"text":"Great Place For Dinner!  Food Quality was excellent and value was exceptional. I ordered the Mediterranean Grill Chicken Breast. For $10 I had two large breasts and a side plus a salad.  The atmosphere was great and they had a nice selection of beers.  Service was very attentive and the owner even greeted the table to make sure everything was done right.  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"A sign on the door says it will be closed for 2 to 4 weeks for remodeling and maybe a name change. Apparently the sign is from about 1/31/15. The lighted sign by the road is gone. I like the place and hope it comes back."}
{"text":"We were really hoping this place would be good, but it wasn't. I loved the look, but the food was disgusting. We ordered the crab dip which was gross and I ordered fettuccine which was canned and tasted awful. The owner was nice and apologized but unfortunately you have to have good food with all the competition out there."}
{"text":"In a word, horrible. The wait staff was actually the high point, but the food was virtually inedible. We had two different appetizers - both tasted bad, not sure if the recipe was bad or the ingredients were bad or both, but I have never turned down cheese dip of any sort and I couldn't eat this. The steak salad was a joke both from a taste standpoint as well as the portion and price. I really wanted this place to be awesome, but would have settled for tolerable, but it was neither. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place needs to make up its mind what it wants to be.  The name infers that it's a bar serving bar food and beers on tap. We walked in for dinner yesterday on a Saturday night and in the bar was a guy in his 30's eating a plate of pasta, a 4-top of women, 2 older gentlemen sipping on beers and 2 other 50ish women having a deep conversation. I had to verify the day of the week with my husband...yes it was a Saturday not a Tuesday.  They did have some local beers on tap which I appreciated.  The NBA Finals were on the big screen, which I would assume most bars would have.  A few minutes into our visit, we figured put why it was so empty.  A lounge act gets in front of the mic and proceeded to play a set of the most depressing music possible. We ate and left quickly.  I doubt we will be back and can't imagine this place staying open for long anyway."}
{"text":"We were very excited about this place. It was nice to see something that wasn't a chain in the area.   Upon arrival on a Saturday night, around 6 pm, the parking lot was full and we were worried about the wait. However, upon walking up we noticed many tables were open (5-6 open 4 tops), but low and behold there was still a 45 minute wait. We decided to grin and bear it.   We ordered some drinks for our wait. I got a beer and the wife got a peach tea that was extremely sweet. Not the best drink for January or ever.   Once seated in a room with a larger party and 5 or 6 more open tables and half the lights not working, we were set to order.   We ordered chicken tenders and buttered pasta for the kids and a pimento blt for the wife and prime rib (medium rare) for me. The chicken tenders were fine (according to my daughter, who has a decent palate), the buttered pasta was awful (according to my son, wife and myself), the pimento blt was bad with a heavily cream cheese (?) based pimento cheese and bread that wasn't toasted, and the prime rib was received well done and under seasoned (which I determined by using the flashlight on my phone because the lights were still out).   Overall, the experience was a fail and it will be difficult to return."}
