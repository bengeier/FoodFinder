{"text":"WARNING If you're thinking about ordering soups here, just go to the store and buy a can of soup because the soups looks and tastes like that's exactly what they do, they just double the price and call it there's.  I ordered a sandwich and fries. It was late, so by the time it got here, the fries were cold, the bread was toasted which was also cold and hard to the point where I had to put it in the microwave. You have been warned, you shouldn't order food from a restaurant that doesn't know how make their own soup, the only thing they know how to do is open a can. keep moving, find somewhere else to dine. There's plenty out there. Make sure they know how to make soup."}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars because management is horrible. The food is decent but nothing to rave about. I live near by and the convenience and prices are factors for why I continue to come. However, the level of service seems to just be getting worse. The business hours state they are open till 9, however I have been told they are closed and refused service (despite lights on, doors open) before 8:30. I've been given the impression the last 2 times I've ordered there that I was inconveniencing them. They are just not friendly and lack acceptible customer service. In the future I will choose to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this place, 6.99 for a large carry out pizza, can't go wrong, they're very nice too"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from Ciao the other night i got the bacon philly. We got  chicken fingers and a four cheese pizza with Alfredo sauce.  My philly was pretty good for. the four cheese pizza was supper good with that Alfredo on it. Ill be ordering from there again soon. Great food fast delivery."}
{"text":"They were rude to me.
Their food is disgusting.
Maybe it was a bad day but, it was horrible for me. Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Ordered bacon cheeseburger pizza for delivery . Took 45 minutes which was fine, the pizza however was very underwhelming. Unripe tomatoes, barely any bacon. Sauce was just ok, and that's probably giving it too much credit. Overall the pizza was just bland and not very good. It's sad when little Cesar's is better"}
{"text":"Second time having pizza here and it was so good..Cooked perfectly and the crew is so friendly..Definitely our new pizza spot.."}
{"text":"Not the greatest service..... incomplete orders delivered. When asked to fix the order, the manager had an attitude.Was promised a discount for large orders and did not get it."}
{"text":"Having been a loyal customer for years and have to say that new people working there have the worst customer service. As they not only had my order wrong but charged me a ridiculous high price. Did not even know the menu. Will not be ordering there again because of their rude service."}
{"text":"We've been ordering from them for years. Their cold and warm subs are pretty good. Love the Chicken Philly! Desserts are great too."}
{"text":"I have to say first time trying their food and have to say it was delicious..Pizza was on point and their wings had alot of meat..will definitely order there again"}
{"text":"This is an update from yesterdays lunch! 

I ordered the wings with fries and they were once again, awesome. Delivery took about 30 mins but they quoted 30 to 40 mins. 

This place consistently puts out good food."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews was expecting a super long wait.  Got my delivery in 20 minutes.  Thought that was pretty dang good.  Everything was hot.  The Pizza was OK - I've had better but there wasn't anything wrong with it. It's what I have come to expect for Las Vegas pizza.  Crust was a little blah and chewy - sauce was good and plenty of cheese.  I might try something else next time."}
{"text":"I've only tried the pizza here but it is probably the best pizza for the price in vegas. You get a 16in one topping pizza for $7! Its way better than little caesars card board pizza and better than the more expensive papa johns, dominos and pizza hut. Again best price and pretty good pizza."}
{"text":"Great take out pizza deal + fries for under 10 bucks! The pizza and fries tasted amazing and were nice n' hot. They told us 20 mins on the phone and had it done earlier than that. Will be definitely ordering here again soon."}
{"text":"Awesome everything!  Best kept secret off the strip, the thin crust pizza is light and delicious, the wings are crisp and meaty.  The Philly cheesesteak rocks and the fresh cut fries make you want more.

We eat here every time we come to Vegas and my Italian mother in law swears by it!

Keep up the good work and we'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Ahhh I forget how expensive ordering from places like these can be...
Lol oh well' 
I'd rate it 4stars for the prices but support your locals !!!
The pizza I ordered was great... even eating the next day was fantastic better than a lot of other places I've bought were leftover pizza was just gross'
The mild wings were not even mild lol I should of ordered hot lol oh well 
I'd buy from here again"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and welcoming! The pizza I ordered was oven-baked to perfection--not too soggy and not burnt. They always place a superfluity amount of toppings as well."}
{"text":"Pizza was the meal of choice by the host of the party. I wasn't familiar with this eatery, so there's a first for everything. Cheese and meatlovers were chosen. The pizzas weren't bad nor great.  I guess I expected more flavor from the pizzas? The pizzas weren't too greasy either, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Had there 1/2 pound hamburger with mushrooms ...it was really good ..people are very nice there all the time ..I also get garlic pizza for my son  with there special and he just loves it... quick and ez..."}
{"text":"If I could leave no stars I would. Order food at 8:43. Still no food at 10:10. Called the restaurant at 9:52 to find out what's up, no answer. They don't close until 10. After several attempts call Grubhub support, they try to call. They say you didn't get your order bc the restaurant was closed. Umm no I ordered it well before they closed. Cancelled and got refund. Too bad. I was excited to try this place.  I rarely give second chances for poor service. At least answer your damn phone."}
{"text":"Our neighborhood is seriously lacking great pizza so we tried this place based on reviews and the pizza was very disapointing.  Just average rack cooked pizza.  The wings and fries were very good and I have had their salads before and they are unique and delicious.  Overall it's good food - the pizza just wasn't my favorite."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. Bought a pizza there and when I got it home found it to be burnt. Called to complain and they told me they would put my name on a \" list \" and make it right on my next visit which I thought was fair. When I called two weeks later to place an order I was told they knew nothing about this and would not honor their pledge to me. Obviously customers are not important to them and for a $7 pizza they lost a faithful customer. Lots of places to buy pizza don't buy from them!"}
{"text":"I ordered the philly cheese steak sandwich. Of course it's not a philly from philly but it's extremely good. Id go on record to say it's the best one I've had in Vegas"}
{"text":"This place won't win any awards for best tasting, but is one hell of a value.  Quick delivery and hot.  Better than any of the big pizza chains.  A massive menu with tons of choices.  Great value!"}
{"text":"They have definitely upped there pizza game. The pizza tastes so much better. I think they have new management. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza overcooked wings onion rings burnt horrible horrible horrible avoid this place"}
{"text":"We've been eating here for years and the past 3 or 4 times have been bad. The pizza crust is soggy and the wings are horrible now. I thought it might of just been a bad batch. But 3 times in a row and they are small over fried super, super greasy. I can no longer eat at ciao. Workers are nice though."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Las Vegas. My wife and I order from here every time we have a craving for pizza. Their sauce is delicious, and they don't drown the pizza in it. They give a good array of toppings and don't skimp on them like the big chains. We're very happy to have found this place on Yelp!"}
{"text":"Great food. Delivery driver is always very kind. Love their philly cheesesteak and the rib meal."}
{"text":"Super slow delivery. Driver is not nice. Pizza is good but smells funny. Will never order from here again. #CaioPizza #AllBad"}
{"text":"We love to order on Friday's and have lunch delivered!
They have a nice variety and the prices are very reasonable $$
No complaints here!!
Just great food"}
{"text":"Salad was yellow. I called to complain and they said it was fresh. I explained it was yellow. They said they washed it and it was fresh, I said it was yellow. They said they would make me another salad but it will look the same."}
{"text":"Customer service is amazing here, Idk about others that posted reviews but it might be a new staff, food took about 10 minutes, prices are cheap,  the guy at the register was very nice and helpful,  he even helped me choose a good meal and save with the specials and most importantly its super clean .. I would definitely come back here if I stay in vegas :))"}
{"text":"Just got home from picking up a pizza. My brother ordered the special 16 inch pizza with 1 topping. I got a small pizza that only feeds 1 person. I was confused with the pizza they gave me, but I just walked out and went home. Guess who came to a house of 4 individuals that where expecting dinner to be pizza??????? Me and those 4 individuals weren't so nice to find out that I brought a small pizza. I called and apparently the special they gave me was for a medium pizza. Who do I yell at/complain to?? My brother or the guy that took the order???? Well enough of me ranting about the horrible service this place gave me. I'll just go to Angelina's and get another pie lol I mean pizza. I used to be a regular but these last couple months they've really gone down the drain....smh"}
{"text":"Love the people there. Everything that I have ordered has been delicious. I recommend thier Philly Cheese Steaks."}
{"text":"We like the calzone, but the sauce is not that great...*+arrives hot..-the friggin owner, Peter, even if u are a regular customer WILL NOT give u extra sauce for your calzone..u get a small shot glass of sauce...EVERYTHING is extra..he lost us as regular customers...NOT a way to treat regulars...I owned a business for 15 years...u gotta give a little ..he never would...even if I wanted \"a little extra pineapple on the side \".  No way $1.25...BS!    No wonder he's closing

6/20/16.....We went to our other favorite pizza places regularly & quit them ..now we wanted to get a Ciao's Special calzone , after months ..picked up..TOTALLY BLACK & burnt.. Unfortunately my husband didn't lift box & look ( which u shouldn't have to, but better do)....so he drove all the way back.. They redid..& BURNT THAT ONE TOO!!! Don't have a pic because he threw it on the floor... This place is going DOWN HILL!!!!   Also, watch your tax...!!!! If u look at ANY RECEIPT, they will scribble item & total, but NOT list TAX, and OVER-CHARGE you!!!!!..Then the 2nd BURNT (with Peter, the Previous owner) there..& he got angry..threw it on the floor ( who wouldn't by now, after a hard days work)..& they CALLED THE POLICE ON HIM!!!! Thank God the Officer MADE THEM make a new one!!!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!!! Shady Business people!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good Gyros, but then I ordered a couple of Calzones and was highly disappointed. Bread was burnt on the outside and raw in the middle, and the sauce was bland. Haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Great pizza, decent prices.  

I'm a fan of their variety of pizzas and menu items.  The crust is definitely among my favorites in town.  It is a nice place, delivery was quick and they had good specials.  Tonight was my second time ordering from them but it will definitely not be my last."}
{"text":"Great subs, desserts and fast service! What else could you ask for? Ah, yes....FREE fries with your subs (unlike some places which charge $2 more for their subs and then want to charge for steak fries) and their menu is huge so you will be able to find something you will like.

Give em a try!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place!!! The pizza seriously taste like back home (Tunisia) which is 1 hour away from Sicilia. The dough, the smell , the tomato sauce!!! Everything. Definitely going to be back very soon! Plus they have deals always ."}
{"text":"Just moved into town from Chicago, we love pizza! So we yelped pizza and stopped in as they are less than a mile away and they had daily deal so we ordered a medium one topping. It took 15 minutes we were off and got home to a great surprise it was really good pizza! 
We will be back!"}
{"text":"Yay!  We've finally found a local pizza place that everyone can agree one.

First, we never do delivery, we call in our order, pick it up, and eat at home.  The wait is normally 20-25 minutes.

I ding a star because one of the employees (owner?) smokes and in the tiny restaurant that is just too much. 

Anyway, we order pizza.  The sauce isn't too sweet and there isn't too much of it.  The crust is thicker than a thin crust but thinner than the \"hand tossed\" you'd find at one of the chains.  They are generous with their toppings.  And the alfredo sauce on the pizza is YUMMY!

For a 14\" with two toppings and alfredo sauce and a 16\" with 5 toppings the tab comes to $25.00.  Not cheap but not expensive either."}
{"text":"Their sign says they are open till 9 get there about 8:28 to order the 16\" special on their sandwich board only to be told they are closed. Their open sign was still on and door wide open. First and last time I'm coming here. Way to go."}
{"text":"A horrible experience. Ordered 2 pizzas for pickup and was told 20 minutes on the phone so I head over and arrive after 15 minutes. When I arrive I was told it would take another 20 minutes! Basically, they never started my order, didn't offer a reason why and acted like they could care less.

Waiting for the pizza the girl asked her coworker why he said 20 minutes to me on the phone and he denied doing it. That makes sense due to talking to a woman on the phone in the first place and she acted like it never happened. They were the only 2 there and then proceeded to speak in a foreign tongue while pointing and staring at me making me feel very uncomfortable.

My order was finished and there was no apology, no discount, nothing and the price was exorbitant! I asked how much a medium veggie pizza was and she pointed to a large price saying they call a large their medium. The 2 topping large was $9 and the medium veggie was $14 which I couldn't understand. All this while advertising a large 1 topping for $7.

The entire time she was incredibly rude to me! Her tone of voice, dismissive nature and completely ignoring me was uncalled for. I've never experienced such incredibly bad customer service at a locally owned pizza place.

I got the pizza home and saying it sucked is putting it mildly. Cheap, canned flavor and the crust had a bad taste to it as well. The pizza was the absolute worst I've had in a very long time. Hardly any veggies on the \"veggie pizza\" which was way overpriced to begin with. On top of all that my entire family were sick to their stomachs after eating their pizza.

If I didn't care about Yelp's standards I'd be using a lot of expletives to describe my experience. Suffice it to say I will NEVER return to Ciao Pizzeria, I will NEVER recommend them to anyone I know and I would tell anyone I care about to steer clear of this establishment. If you value your money, your health and being treated courteously than stay away."}
{"text":"The pick up order was slow considering there was not much business.   The girl was friendly enough but her accent was so strong we had to do the whole pointing thing to place an order.  The lunch special one ordered (a small pizza ) took 30 minutes, so I was a bit rushed.  The pizza was ok.  Not bad, not great but ok."}
{"text":"Garlic butter crust with tomatoes and mushrooms and lots of cheese. Sooooo good. Fast hot delivery too"}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for years and never tried their pizza. We stopped in on a Saturday and asked for a menu we could take home, the guy behind the counter told us they had one left, but should be getting a new shipment in tomorrow. So, we left the single menu there and forgot about the place.

Craving pizza one night, we decided to give them a shot. Their prices were reasonable, and the pizza we got was real good! I am not that particular about pizza, as long as it isn't a chain, I will usually like it, but their pizza sticks out as very appealing in both appearance and taste.

Anxious to get another round of pizzas from Ciao so I can gorge myself again!"}
{"text":"Ordered a veggie pizza. It was really good and had a lot of veggie toppings thin crusted and low in greese!$$"}
