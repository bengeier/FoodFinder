{"text":"What is there to say? The food was awesome! I had the chicken katsu bento box. The mixed tempura was perfect. My husband and son enjoyed their meal as well. Place is clean and the service was great. We'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing
Service is like a 5 star restraunt servers are super nice and on the ball my drink was never empty 
And the most expensive item is 10.75   All the food prices are cheap average around 8 bucks"}
{"text":"\"I want Japanese!\"
\"I want Korean!\"
\"I want Hawaiian\"
\"I want sushi!\"

\"Let's go to Mom's!!!\"

But seriously, the grilled chicken and chicken katsu are really good."}
{"text":"Went here to eat on 10/27/16 after a long drive from Anaheim to Vegas. Great service and the food was very good for the money (tasty and the portions quite generous). Had the tempura udon and the Kalbi dinner."}
{"text":"This is our favorite food place when we are craving for hawaian or sushi food. The serving is huge and the taste is better than competition like l&l . Island flavor and aloha kitchen. It is really that good that we visit an average of 3 times a week. 

They offer to-go and the ambiance is really nice and clean. The servers are very friendly. Their salad is so good and the teriyaki and bbq plates are in great portion! Love this place so much!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with a friend. I had a chicken bento box and it was fantastic. The portions were great for lunch, and I still too food home with me! It came with a salad, miso soup, teriyaki chicken, steamed rice, shrimp and vegetable tempura, and 4 pieces of California roll. It was way too much for me, but for 9.00 it was a great deal.

The staff were very friendly and the service was great."}
{"text":"OMG, perhaps this is the best resturant for getting great amounts of food for very low prices. Very tasty. Enjoyed~~"}
{"text":"Been meaning to write a review for a while. This place is wonderful! Food is very tasty, friendly service. In addition, atmosphere is  clean and pleasant!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, whether during the lunch rush or when they're dead.
Food is excellent. Have yet to find something on the menu that wasn't delicious.
Portions are great size for the price."}
{"text":"Stopped by to check it out and was pleasantly surprised, the place is clean the staff very attentive food is fantastic, there is a variety to choose from, my husband and I found a new place to eat at that is close to home. We highly recommend this place. We love it"}
{"text":"The service was great. A nice new mom and pop restaurant with surprisingly good food. Portions were really large for the price. I would definitely come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I come here very often and always recommend this place to all my friends! Great service, food, and the proportion sizes are amazing for the price! Best teriyaki place in Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. The restaurant itself is small & quaint; gives off a \"hole in the wall\" kind of vibe. The food is delicious & you get good size portions for a great value. My husband and I love Hawaiian food & our kids love Japanese, so it satisfied all of us. The spam musubi tasted a little burnt to me, but my husband likes his spam crispy & enjoyed it so I am not taking stars away for this. Service was quick and servers were friendly. I will definitely be back. They cater too!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Had the Salmon Teriyaki it was amazing. This is my second time there last time had the Kalbi and Chicken Plate which was equally as good. Sushi looked good but have not tried it yet. Service was nice and attentive. Would definitely go back for a unique Japanese-Hawaiian experience."}
{"text":"Came in with my daughter for lunch! Friendly staff, yummy food and reasonable! Yummy Kim Chee"}
{"text":"Standard Hawaiian food menu with a few twists I appreciated. A few sushi options are available if you wanted some with your meal which I did! Service was brief but responsive - never more than I needed, which is nice. Their chicken katsu is some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now. Food is amazing! Service is friendly and fast - especially to go orders. Great lunch spot. Wish I lived closer so I could come for dinner too!

Recommendations on trying the gyoza chicken teriyaki bowl. So much yum!!"}
{"text":"This spot is legit! Great food, great service, good portions all at a fair price. Who knew Vegas would have a great spot like this! The food was DELICIOUS! I could not stop eating! Definitely coming back around next time I'm in town. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Low key place, clean, fast, and delicious menu choices. When you want food with Hawaiian Island flair, this is the place. I had the beef bento and it was very tasty and generous. I had to take some of it home - couldn't eat it all. Husband had a combo plate which was also delicious and generous. Nice, nice people serving you, too. And great value!"}
{"text":"This is the most prime example of a $ and 5-star joint I have come across in vegas. We have been 3 times and every time the service and quality of the food are nothing shy of amazing. Yuri is our favorite server."}
{"text":"Great options, delish and affordable! We had a little of everything and cleaned our plates!"}
{"text":"Its a really good place to eat korean food. Its more like American style. But the price it's fair and should come next time."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Great food for great price. I've been to L&L, Aloha Kitchen & this place beats it for sure. It doesn't give you that nasty full feeling. It feels satisfying, healthy. Service was good. Server was nice, not annoying in your face or rude. Definitely coming back. Satisfied customer"}
{"text":"Food was super yummy!!!! Kind of a little expensive though...I know for sure is better than L&L I go to. Definitely on my favorite list of eating place to go to...love it"}
{"text":"Mom's Teriyaki is a gem!  \"Mom\"/owner  cooking in the kitchen is a gem!  I drove by this place and made a mental note to try and so glad we did! Was happy with our orders of Coconut shrimp, beef teri, katsu chicken and Japche. Portion, just enough to feed a hungry Mr. B, so that is great! Our meal for two came to just under thirty dollars...even better. 

You can place your order to go or dine in. The host/server will ask you. The guys working here were really nice, accommodating and put with my silly questions. (So is she your mom? points to lady cooking in the kitchen..I asked all the employees..lol).

The space is clean, casual atmosphere, but tiny, so better coming  during off hours and avoid the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Neat and clean restaurant, huge portions, great low price, very friendly staff and loved the decor of the place but most importantly,the taste of the food, it was just awesome! I tried the Combo special #36 (large size) and the Chicken plate (#19) it came with sides of soup, salad and mac salad. Also tried the shrimp crunch roll and it was delicious! Oh and for the opening they are offering free cans of soda which was nice."}
{"text":"If you looking for the good customer service stay away from this restaurant, the lady work from here never say hi to the customer i went this restaurant yesterday i was so surprised her rude attitude to customer i asked her to about seat and she said \"just go seat any where!\" I still dont know why she answer me with harsh tone voice"}
{"text":"I seriously love this place!! Their food is amazing and fresh!! Didn't mind the wait. The ladies there are so nice and welcoming!! The cashier that took my order was very helpful!! Can't wait to go back. This place will defiantly be my go too from now on!!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favorite Hawaiian BBQ places in Vegas. Thank you always Mom for wonderful food and a wonderful atmosphere! The food is always amazing we ordered the small number 36 and the kalbi is true authentic flavor! The side order of kimchi is definitely worth and macaroni salad is a wonderful side to the meats. The shrimp crunch roll is one of my favorites on the menu and it even comes with the plate! Small is a good size for one and it will fill you up. The sauce that comes with the salad appetizer is one of the best salad dressings I've ever had. They need to let me in on their secret. Mom gave us a sample of this poke spicy tuna with seaweed salad and crunchy topping and it's so much better than most poke places I've had. I always visit Mom's Teriyaki whenever I visit Vegas from Reno and they never fail to impress. Thank you Mom! See you soon."}
{"text":"You have to come here. This place is amazing. I couldn't finish my meal without telling my yelpers about this fantastic spot. I need to return at least twice a week it's that good"}
{"text":"So far,

I've visited this place a few times, and I always the get the spam musubi. It's simple and simply delicious. Some places get the rice to spam ratio wrong, but here, it's perfect. The sauce in between the spam and rice hits the spot for me.

The owner is such a nice lady. Service here is excellent and the staff are friendly.

The combo special is a great deal.

Sweet spot for a small gathering of 3-4 people.

Mom's Teriyaki, you've earned my review."}
{"text":"Service is outstanding, prices are very affordable and the menu selection is amazing! I had the chicken plate with salad. The Katsu was good and crisp, the rice perfect and green tea hit the spot for a chilly day. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've quickly grown fond of this little place!  They offer a variety of bento boxes and combo plates that are perfect for someone like me, who likes to try a little bit of this and that throughout their meal. They also have a small sushi menu and some salads, perfect for grubbing after the gym.

The chicken katsu and kalbi plates are a hit with both me and my guy- portions are generous, and I like subbing their mac salad for the rice since it's not as creamy as other spots and has a nice peppery flavor to it. The bento boxes are my favorite to grab and go, making a small feast for only about $10. 

Service is polite and food comes out fast. They have the door bell style buttons to summon the waitstaff to your table, which I don't typically like, but they're usually attentive enough that I don't have to use it. Location is small but clean and nicely decorated, they usually get pretty busy for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great place for Japanese/Korean/Hawaiian infused food. The kalbi is the best, super tender and great sauce used to bbq it. The shrimp tempura is so good especially the sauce used with it. I love everything they serve here, you can never go wrong with their choices"}
{"text":"This place is gives you so much food for a small amount! I always get the barbecue chicken/chicken Katsu, two scoops of rice, sushi and house salad and two lilikoi drinks.
Service is always quick and the setting is quaint, but still nice. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Nice staff, clean store, delicious food that came quick, affordable prices.

One of my favorite restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Friendly staffs and affordable delicious food. Pretty much everything on menu are under $10. Generous amount of food as well.
Usually quick service. They do have lunch rush sometimes just like any other restaurant.
Its cute clean local restaurant and i love it! Will continue to come here and i highly recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"My wife and I come in to Moms on a regular basis.  They know what we usually order for drinks and have it ready before we even sit down.  The portions are huge for a good price.  The food is also excellent.  I like to get the different combo platters depending on my mood and I never go wrong on any choice."}
{"text":"Went on a quick date with the boyfriend here. Everything was fresh and savory! The service was good too! Really nice girls! Thank you! Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and love everything! The food is on point and you can't beat the price. Super quick service, great for lunch and/or dinner.. staff was on point and they are all super kind.. for sure going to be my go to spot!"}
{"text":"This place food is so~~~good 
 Every  dish is fantastic  ..
Price  is good too.
Me and my husband  eat ..check come in we  can ask them something wrong we eat a lot price too little. Something miss item ? 
 They say it's wright  price . ..
I highly recommend  everybody go and try... 
Taste good price more good .
Thank you 
Mom's teriyaki"}
{"text":"Super friendly waitress and generous portions. Heard a lot about this place and am glad I came! Food was very flavorful, no raw fish but the rolls were good. Wish it was closer but I will make the trip . New customer !"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding and very reasonable. Also the customer service is awesome.  I visit there quite often. And if you're from Hawaii, you will definitely appreciate the flavors there."}
{"text":"FIRST THING ..... in a sketchy area and doesn't look appealing from the outside 
SECOND THING..... you'll forget about it once you try the #37 bento for $12. It is hands down the best bento in Vegas for the price. The Teri chicken was too good to be true along with the unique katsu with pre added katsu sauce but didn't need more at all, to top it off the 4pc sushi crunch roll sealed the deal. definitely coming back !!!"}
{"text":"this is our first time here,we will definitely have to come back and try some other dishes.   the bento boxes were great, and the tempura was excellent. definitely a hole in the wall  worth trying.  fantastic SERVICE  keep up the PHENOMENAL work!!!!  yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is OUTSTANDING! I have nothing to complain about. Everything was excellent; from the freshness of the food, the portion sizes, the service and the prices! I feel full, satisfied and energized. I hope they don't change anything about this place because i will now be a regular customer!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! Quick, tasty, clean, and affordable. Friendly staff. Cannot go wrong.."}
{"text":"Service was amazing and quick, FOOD was even better!!! Our server was very accommodating and polite. This is now my favorite Japanese/Hawaiian restaurant."}
{"text":"99cent special on the musubis! Huge portions! Great prices! Awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"I came here with my bf to check out the hype! The reviews are true, the portions are huge here. I was craving for short ribs so I ordered the kalbi with chicken teriyaki. Oh my was it delicious. The chicken was super tender and soft, not rubbery like other places. Kalbi was kalbi! The macaroni salad was a bit different than what I'm used to, but it was just as good. TBH I wanted to try the chicken Katsu and hoped they had a kalbi/katsu combo but they didn't have that option on the menu. However I read a few reviews saying the katsu wasn't too great so I guess it was meant to be. 

My boyfriend ordered the beef and gyoza bowl and holy cow was it huge. He usually doesn't eat much, but he finished the whole dang bowl! I guess it was that delicious. 

The restaurant is quite small but when we went to dine in there was nobody else dining. The tables have buttons that you can press for service, I didn't really get to use it since we were the only ones there. The server was quick and friendly. Overall not a bad choice if you're super hungry, you'll definitely get the bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Mom's teriyaki more like mom's teriyummy amirite?? 

Lol I didn't actually try their teriyaki but instead opted for the California roll because it was 4.50! how awesome is that? where else can you get a roll for 4.50 besides your local, very questionable, grocery store sushi section neighbored right next to frozen cauliflower florets and smart water? Which is why this place automatically gets 4/5 stars lol 

The reason they didn't get 5/5 is because I'm having trouble figuring out this restaurant's identity with its outer worldly alien space font, pictures of wine and grapes as decor, and the random jap chae they have on the menu lol. (Still down to try it.)
However, the lady that served us was nice! Glad I found a place to fulfill my \"sort of feeling sushi just want a basic roll\" cravings."}
{"text":"service was fast and friendly. 
The food was delicious and big portions. 
The Combo plate beef and chicken could have fed two of us. I had another dinner in the to go box. 
The sushi was fresh and flavorful. 
The Hawaiian drink was very refreshing. 
The beef was tender and flavorful. The rice and Macaroni salad was also very tasty. 
This spot is definitely worth the 5 minute drive off of the 15 freeway. 
I will be back."}
{"text":"Place adorable!!!!!...Food delicious!!!!!! Customer service on point!
Officially my lunch spot"}
{"text":"You must come here!!! Not only is the food amazing but the customer service is AMAZING! They were so attentive and so welcoming! This is like your moms cooking!!! We drove all the way down from Henderson!!! Also the prices were so reasonable! Definitely worth the drive! We will be coming back! They even threw in some appetizers in for us!! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"I work right around the corner, stopped in for take out and the interior is immaculate.  Was immediately greeted and assisted, prompt and efficient service.  They even got the door for me on the way out.  The food was very good and the prices were very reasonable.  Will not be my last time eating here."}
{"text":"great staff, very attentive!  their mango avocado salad is fantastic!  i always get vegetable tempura as an appetizer...their fry is fresh and light!

one of my favorite stops, for sure!"}
{"text":"First time trying this and it was amazing! I got the #36 and my wife got the chicken bowl and they were both really good. A very generous amount of food for a good price. Probably my new favorite Hawaiian place"}
{"text":"I support mom and pop joints, this place has good food, good portions and cheap prices and a friendly staff. Would definitely stop by again when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Low prices, good portions, nice variety, great combos, friendly staff. 

I got kalbi, Katsu, sushi, miso soup, salad, and a can of sprite for less than $13 with tax. 

Nothing was mind-blowing, but it was all well worth the price. If you're in the mood for a little lotta bit of Korean food, you'll be happy with this choice."}
{"text":"For their grand opening they are offering free drinks. Kind and attentive wait staff. Currently not serving their Korean menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for some Katsu & Kalbi! Not to mention the salad dressing on the salad is amazing! *side note...I order my salad with shredded cabbage instead of regular iceberg lettuce! Portions are perfect size & prices are on point! Staff is always very friendly & efficient! Never had a bad meal! Give it a try..you won't be disappointed! Also, don't forget to get your reward card stamped each visit!"}
{"text":"Ordered large chicken kabob and chicken katsu combo, shrimp fried rice, and a cali roll. Portion sizes are huge! Way too much food! Chicken kabobs were great. Chicken Katsu wasn't anything special. Side of macaroni salad was alright. Shrimp fried rice was excellent with a good amount of shrimp. Cali roll was decent. Took it to go and wait time was about 10 minutes.  Spent about $25. Not sure if I would go back but was worth a try."}
{"text":"IF YOUR NOT KOREAN-PREPARE FOR PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT-- I took my family here for the first time and my kids like the food. HOWEVER, once we are done eating we didn't get those Korean ice pop which they given out to other customer. So my daughter decide to ask for those popsicle, they asked her to pay them!! I told them how come they give other customer for free?!!.and their stupid answer is that: \"we don't give out for our current customer\". I reply to them: current customer?! I'm from California! How the f*ck I'm your current customer? This restaurant is a DAMN f***ing RACIST toward other Asian if your not Korean or Caucasian.  I know in California Korean restaurant is known for being racist toward  their customer, but never thought in Vegas. I don't think I will go here again if I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Best chicken teriyaki in town and the prices are insanely reasonable! It's definitely a local spot and they have great customer service."}
{"text":"The best teriyaki in town! Huge portions, fast service, feiendly staff. Take out is as good as dine it. Everything is packed neatly and your food arrives just as you would enjoy it dining in. I have no conplaints. This restaurant is small, but the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Aloha from... Vegas!!!!

No joke, we love to eat. We LOVE to eat a lot of food when in Vegas. We also love to spend a ton of money pressing buttons on electronic slot machines, with hopes of winning so much money on the penny machine that we can reset the out of office reply to the following:

\"Won $5,000,000 at the penny slots in Vegas. Go fuc....\"

With that in mind, we were in the mood this go around to checkout the local food scene and see what locals were eating. We found our way to Mom's and wouldn't ya know it?? We LOVED it!!!

Bento box is the way to go and that's what we did. I had the beef, which was tender and had a wonderful smokey flavor going on. Super good stuff!! We ordered up Kimchi and I was waxing poetically to my wife about how this recipe must be from the owners great, great, great, great grandmother cause it was so fresh and so clean clean. Get it?? Alas, the waiter broke our hearts when he informed us that it's from a bottle. Although, the bottle was purchased at the local Korean market. See?? 

I absolutely love that you can eat like a king and spend like a popper at this local hangout."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight and was absolutely delish! Definitely a hidden gem! Very affordable and huge portions. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Officially my favorite little spot this side of town! I have has the spicy pork twice and both times it was packed with savory spicy Korean flavor. I did the pro move and ordered a side of kimchi which really hits the spot with this dish. They start you out with a small salad with ginger dressing that makes you feel slightly better about all the for coming carbs. With the entre it includes two scoops of rice and a scoop of slightly spicy mac salad that is super duper creamy. Prices are incrediably reasonable as well. Service is fast and furious. Perfect for lunch or a great Dinner."}
{"text":"My friend andrew took me here and we ate, portions are HUGE, meals are delicious, just amazing for the pricing too. With just 10 dollars me and andrew got food coma but  food is on point here I will be back"}
{"text":"I loved this place! Definitely coming back, small mom and pops place better than anywhere on the strip prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Mom's Teriyaki is a casual but tasty eatery, offering large portions at affordable prices. Service was friendly and prompt.

The interior is not big and is simple, but I feel like many people probably order takeout. The menu offers quite a few offerings, and the combos are nice if you want to try multiple things. They offer a large size which I opted for, but unless you are really hungry, the standard size is likely generous enough (I was unable to finish the large, and I can eat a lot of food).

Most of the dishes are Hawaiian, and are prepared fresh. The food itself was fairly tasty; not the absolute best Hawaiian I have ever had, but very good and you can't complain about the price and portions.

Definitely recommend for a quick casual meal."}
{"text":"What do you get when you combine great food, an odd location, and two cute cashiers/waitresses?  You get mom's teriyaki.

I came here once with my friends and once again today by myself.  I am thoroughly convinced that this place is well worth a visit from anyone who is open to teriyaki of any kind.  I recommend the gyoza, the hot and spicy pork, anything with kalbi or katsu, and especially the kimchi.  I have encountered very few places out here that do kimchi very well.  Thankfully, this place is one of them.  If you are hungry and you are in this strange and busy area, do yourself a favor and stop by here."}
{"text":"Good high quality food, sort of a Hawaiian spin on teriyaki and Japanese.  Tasty, fast, big portions."}
{"text":"Services were very polite food is excellent lots to choose from highly recommended you won't be disappointed oh and the prices are great."}
{"text":"Clean establishment, great improvement from the business before. Came here for office lunch, satisfied with taste,portion and price. Tried their poke, combo special and udon."}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem! They serve great Japanese/Hawaiian fusion dishes. We tried Bulgogi, spicy pork, gyoza, shrimp crunch roll and spring rolls. Everything was awesome, spicy pork is the winner!"}
{"text":"First, i always like a clean restaurant and a greeting and received both walking in. It is a small, some would say quaint. Menus are under the glass on the tables sodas are in cans. I had the Kalbi plate (only 11.95!!). Wife got the teriyaki salmon plate, older son got two spam musubi and cactus roll. Kalbi arrived and 8 bones with plenty of meat arrived. So worth it! Wife was very quiet and ate everything but the print on the plate. Both the teriyaki sauce on the salmon and the Kali marinade were on point. We we're ib the area from inspirada (about a 40 min drive) and we will be making the drive here again soon. Great food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Very Good Food  clean place   yummmy....
Excelent customer service .. serving is huge .... price is right...."}
{"text":"I wasn't a huge fan at first, but in the past few months, I realized I've been here at least once every week! The prices are reasonable, the food is good, and it's better than more popular places like L&L! I always get either the salmon bento or the tempura udon. The salmon bento comes with a generous portion of salmon, a california roll, shrimp + vegetable tempura, rice and salad. I love that the california roll tastes really fresh and the tempura sauce is flavorful and not too watered down. Also, I find that this is one of the few places in Vegas that make really good, flavorful udon. 

The reason I'm giving this place four stars instead of five is for their spotty service. I always ask to replace the salad with extra rice and to remove the cucumber from the cali roll because I'm allergic. About half the times they forget, so now I have to make sure to repeat myself multiple times and ask again when I pick up the food lol.  Also, one time I ordered the salmon bento over the phone and was told it would be ready in 10 min. When I got there 15 min later, the guy at the front said he accidentally gave away my order to another person, so I had to wait another ten minutes. On the plus side, he offered me a free drink and a \"members VIP discount\" card that's good for 10% off every time I go.  

Overall, I like the food here a lot, but I wish they were more attentive and careful with their orders."}
{"text":"Stopped here from Phoenix, AZ! Wanted a bento meal & Googled & yelped Mom's Teriyaki! Don't have pictures of what we ordered(so sorry) but if U stop here u will not b disappointed! The portions were big & the food was flavorful & the soup  OMG... U have to try their soups! You have to try this place cause we definitely will & next time will take pics!"}
{"text":"There's a small space when you first walk in which can get congested with guests having just arrived and servers trying to pass with dishes, but you're greeted pretty much straight away, given menus and seated so it's not an issue for long.
The inside of the restaurant is pretty plain and simple and I can understand how this place can get a little too busy at peak times as seating extends around the counter but is a little limited.
As far as food goes, this might not be an issue for most but PLEASE BE AWARE, the gyoza does not mention what, if any, meat is inside on any of the 3 gyoza dishes on the menu so I went to order the beef gyoza rice bowl and it wasn't until I double checked that the server told me it was chicken & veg - I don't eat chicken so I was lucky not to order something I couldn't eat as this info wasn't offered or clear.
I asked if I could sub the gyoza for a different appetiser but was refused. No customisation allowed and these cannot be made to order.
As a result, we went for the beef rice bowl, the kalbi/chicken special dish and some spam musubis. The portion sizes were good and the food itself was delicious!! The sauces and dressings are so tasty and the meat given is so good, generous and not full of fat. All the flavours were prominent and not hidden by grease or cooking oils too.
Both of us were very impressed with what we ordered and loved the Asian/Hawaiian inspired food.
Will definitely return for some great food!"}
{"text":"I give four stars just for the taste of the food. I ate Bulgogi. Size of the portion is small actually, full with a lot of rice and noodles but smaller amount of meat. But that's why it has cheap prices. The interior of the restaurant is not inviting at all, but for fast meal it's ok"}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of Hawaiian BBQ places but the quality of Moms seems to be a touch above the rest.

Their combo prices are some of the cheapest I've seen, the service is great. I eat here about once every week."}
{"text":"Found this gem on yelp and was close by with good reviews so decided to try it out. Would give it more stars if I could. The Service was amazing, portion sizes were huge, and Price was awesome. I would recommend this place to anybody. Best teriyaki bowl I've ever tasted"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some delicious and fresh Hawaiian BBQ food then this is the place to go! I absolutely love Mom's Teriyaki!!! The food is amazing! The service is very friendly. In addition, the price is very economical!"}
{"text":"Great Japanese/Korean style restaurant with a great variety of dishes. I love their bento boxes (with Kalbi) and it's a great deal in my opinion for a ton of food.
We come here every two weeks and try something new every time.
It has become our favorite mom & pop quick bite restaurant. Service is always friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, authentic quality and great value. The service was prompt and friendly. I really liked the Korean desert options that come in their original  packaging. 
Overall, a great little restaurant"}
{"text":"Wow! Coming from Hawai'i we have food restaurants like this but this place was winners! The price, quality & quantity cannot go wrong. When I return back to Vegas this will be my go too..."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since they had really good reviews . The food was mediocre . But they had good selection of food . The waitress was nice. I would recommend this place to someone , if they wanted to get something quick to eat."}

{"text":"Great food bad service. A 30 minuet wait because they had a big order to go for the following business day. They should take care of the in house guest first."}
{"text":"The Kalbi & Chicken Katsu combo was tasty and cooked to perfection.  It came with salad, miso, and shrimp tempura roll.  They served big portions too so I was very pleased!  We were served coconut shrimp, teriyaki chicken, and free ice cream dessert, compliments of the chef.  The ambiance and service was top notch.   I was so glad to have driven across town to experience what my family from Hawaii kept raving about during their recent stay last week.  They stopped in nightly to eat dinner as it truly did taste like mom's teriyaki (no pun intended)."}
{"text":"I like how they also have sushi and how you can get a little bit of everything in your plate. You get your food right away. It was pretty good, just not amazing amazing. Not super flavorful for me."}
{"text":"You know it's going to be good when it's called Moms Teriyaki. Mom cooking is usually the best! In this case this place had good food and the prices were affordable. The inside was cute with nice decorations. I liked their tables because it's glass and you can see the menu right there. I thought it was a nice idea. I came there to order to go. The girls up front was very fast and friendly. Which is nice to see because some places don't have friendly service sometimes so it was nice to see the girls smile and be friendly. I would definitely bring back my boyfriend here to eat for lunch. I would like to try their other dishes here. I ordered the Kalbi, chicken Katsu, and shrimp roll small order for $7.99. It was good portion size and price was definitely affordable which is really nice. It came with a small salad for me. Everything was good! I'm glad they give you the sauce on the side for the chicken. Beef was flavorful and tender. Good portion size of the rice. Delicious! I definitely recommend this place to everyone. Happy eating everyone! :-)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good size portions, and a fair price. Would recommend the combo meals since it does give you a good variety of options. If you've had teriyaki before, this will meet your expectations, but won't blow you away. If you haven't had teriyaki before, it's a great place to try it for the first time (if you're driving through the area)."}
{"text":"My friend and I selected this restaurant based on its Yelp reviews. 
We were seated quickly and the wait person was friendly.
Our meals came quickly and the food was very good. I liked their combo meals b/c I really wanted to different things (CA rolls and Teriyaki bowl) and (wow!) they had that in a combo meal. Yum!
The server checked on us once which was the right number for me. Also, they had a cool call box on the table in which we could request additional beverages or whatever. (we didn't use it but it was clever).

I recommend this restaurant b/c good service and good food."}
{"text":"Its my first time eating at this place. The place is nice and have privacy on most of tables coz its divided with a divider. I really like the food that i order was gyoza chicken bowl which comes with vegetables on the bowl and the kalbi chicken katsu shrimp crunch roll comes with salad on the side. The price is affordable for student like me, and the customer service is awesome. Definitely coming back here with bunch of friends"}
{"text":"Mom's Teriyaki is a must try if you're looking for authentic Japanese food! My bf, niece and I found this hidden gem sparingly driving around town. I ordered the beef bento box which is a perfect portion for anyone. It came with salad which was fresh and the dressing was a sweet creamy texture. It also came with miso soup which had the right amount of saltiness not the overwhelming seaweed taste. The bento box consisted of California rolls which tasted like any other Cali roll but the tempuras  were all nicely battered with a nice crisp. The beef teriyaki was SOOOO DELICIOUS! tender and just the right amount of teriyaki sauce but I think my favorite not pictured because I took bites from my nieces box was the salmon! It was perfectly glazed and the sides were nice and crispy and the fish was not dry very very juicy and flavorful. I will definitely be coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"Soooo good... the next time I'm in Vegas I'll be stopping by again. Can't wait to go back. Don't love Vegas but I do love there food."}
{"text":"Good food! I got the California roll and the beef rib plate. I took a star off because I wanted to get double mac salad instead of the house salad, and was given double mac but instead of rice, I got the salad. Also, everywhere I've been, beef rib plates come with 9 pieces or 3 slices and this one only had 8. Not a big deal, but if I'm paying the same price as a plate that gives me 9 pieces, I want 9 pieces. Other than that, the food was filling and of good quality (I can't say for the salad though, I threw it away)."}
{"text":"For the price it can't be beat. I missed my mom's home cooking while living in Vegas, and this place quenched my cravings. I just wish they wouldn't charge for such small portions of kimchi."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time. The food and service was fantastic! ! Highly recommend! !!!"}
{"text":"My family and I always come here on the regular and we are treated like Ohana (family) here by the people and owners. The food is always consistent with the quality and taste, I have tried everything on the menu already and I can say no matter what you order her the food will be cooked with Aloha and taste so Ono (good)."}
{"text":"Yes - those prices are legit and yes - the food is SO GOOD (even when it's via Bitesquad). 

I was honestly impressed at how good this food was. I was craving kalbi and mac salad and had to try this place when I saw it on bitesquad. I was thinking, \"is it too good to be true?\" - like, where are you gonna find a kalbi & katsu rice place for $9?! With legit portions and extremely fresh. There's even a mix plate of like 3 or 4 proteins and sides for like $7.95! Ridiculously amazing! 

We also tried fried gyoza which were like any other gyoza, a crunchy shrimp tempura roll (also very good), and when asking for mac salad on the side for some orders - THEY HOOKED IT UP. Spam musubi rice to spam ratio was legit - not a ton of rice but just enough. 

Not a single person in my order for 8 complained. Every single person loved it. 

It's been about a week and I'm still not over it. Such a good meal, unbelievable pricing, and definitely plan to physically go in and check it out but if I'm this happy with the delivery quality - I know I will still love it when it's even fresher and in front of me. 

Highly recommend this place if you're ballin on a budget or if you're craving some Korean or Hawaiian food but are sick of L&L and too far away from Island Flavor or Aloha Kitchen."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots. 

The food is amazing and the service is great. The employees who work here are always friendly and attentive. 

Before taking on my vegetarian life style I tried the teriyaki chicken, teriyaki beef, and chicken katsu. For you meat eaters, this is exceptional teriyaki and you will be pleased with anything you order. 

Since switching to the vegetarian diet, I still enjoy the salad and the egg rolls from here. The salad dressing is so yummy! 

Friends of mine have tried the pork and fried rice and they have thought it to be great as well. 

This is a great spot. Highly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"I ordered over the phone while perusing the reviews for this place and the guy taking my order was very patient and helped me make my selections. I ended up ordering a chicken/steak combo (I think?), spam masubi, and udon with Cali roll and shrimp tempura. He said it would be about 10 minutes and it was ready right on time for pick up. The same guy who took my order rang my order out and was once again super nice and courteous. Only minor thing was he accidentally handed me the wrong check, but apologized when I pointed it out and was professional about his mistake. Before paying, I asked how much sodas were and he said $1, but that I could have one for their grand opening for free! Free soda? Hell yea! I noticed that they had Hawaiian sodas, too, so I asked how much those were and I don't remember what he said for the pricing, but he offered to give me one of those instead of regular soda for free! I asked him which one was most popular and he said that the pineapple/orange one was, but I'm not a huge fan of orange so he mentioned guava was the next most popular. I said yes to guava and told him about how there's another brand of those Hawaiian sodas and I always hear about how the lilikoi is the best and he offered to give me one of those as well to try! Overall, super duper service from a genuinely nice employee and the food was fresh, yummy, and beautifully packaged with utensils and napkins! Plus, I used to come here every so often when it was called \"Well Being in the Box\" and I think this new name and possibly new management is heading in the right direction and is possibly even yummier than before. A+ job today!"}
{"text":"Good pricing, good food, good portion sizes! All of it prepared to order, so you may have a little wait, but worth it. Nice place to eat or take it to go. Only wish they had Gyuudon..."}
{"text":"Food is always good! Staff are nice and friendly. This is my go to place when i don't bring my lunch/dinner to work since its only 1 mile away and it is soooo delicious! Will try other choices on the menu soon!"}
{"text":"Good, cheap food! It isn't amazing, but you can't really beat a $10 bento box with an entree, 4pc Cali roll, miso soup, rice, and side salad. That's a pretty stellar deal! Their tempura definitely tastes like it's bought frozen and fried, but sometimes that's all you need when you have a craving."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  It is inviting, and everything is well decorated. 

We sat down, and the menus are displayed on the tables.  Everything looked so good, hard to decide.  

Chose the salmon/chicken combo, with rice, macaroni salad and house salad.  The house salad dressing, was one of the best salad dressings I have ever tasted.  I am thinking a thousand island/oil blend, I don't know but good. I would love to have a huge salad with that dressing. 

My rice, macaroni salad, and chicken/salmon were also very good. The teriyaki sauce is thick and sweet, not all watered down and soy sauce tasting.  The portions are also very generous. 

I would definitely come back, and look forward to that dressing again."}
{"text":"Stopped in after picking up my car and super satisfied!
This place is adorable and an absolute gem
Got the Udon with shrimp tempura and the baked lobster roll 
Great music, service and vibes"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the Japanese-Hawaiian concept. Menu had a good number of items from plates to bowls to rolls. They serve Loco Moco! Had the Salmon Teriyaki Plate, my go to lunch when I try such places. Salad was good, Salmon was fresh, teriyaki sauce not overpowering, just right. Service was good, nice guys."}
{"text":"This is the first place I thought of visiting when I had a craving for Hawaiian BBQ. The restaurant is small and had some friendly staff. I ordered the kalbi and teriyaki chicken plate which came with a scoop of rice and Mac salad. Kalbi had a good amount of meat and the teriyaki chicken was flavorful and not overdone with sauce. I had a bite of my friends chicken katsu which is probably my favorite item I've tried from their menu. This place all around is good and a step up from other Hawaiian BBQ places like L&L. Their menu had a variety of things to try like bowls and bento boxes. I'll be back to try some more!"}
{"text":"i probably swing by here every other week if not at LEAST once a month. the beef bento is my favorite hands down and you get a LOT of food with it. the salad dressing is great, the veggie tempura is crispy and the sauce is delicious, every part of it is great"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS SUPER FIRE I LOVE IT. Went here on a triple date yesterday it was so lit, like omg!! The food is super tasty I got the beef japchae and the number 27 large, portions are huge! Split between me and my boyfriend we didn't even finish it and had a ton of leftovers!! - 2nd time coming back with just my boyfriend, LOVE THIS PLACE STILL. Customer service on point and the food is still bomb"}
{"text":"Great prices and great food. Ordered pick up and it was ready in 15 min. Only thing is they didn't have garlic chili sauce and the lady looked at me like I was crazy when I asked."}
{"text":"Foods always great and I'm in and out in less than 10mins.  Friendly staff, always smiling. Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"Great price, great food. Never heard about this place till today, had the Kalbi and chicken katsu plate. Chicken was fried perfectly and I'm usually hesitant when it comes to Kalbi, as a lot of places does it wrong. The Kalbi was nice and tender."}
{"text":"Moms teriyaki is bomb.com. Amazing service as well!!! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is by favorite Teriyaki/Korean food place here in Vegas. There food is great tasting and nice presentation."}
{"text":"Very good food for cheap! Service is great too. Had the chicken bowl with half California roll and it hit the spot! It was a surprisingly large portion and very tasty. They also have these cool service paging thingies on the table, so you never wait long for service."}
{"text":"First time was yesterday I was looking for something I can quickly grab to eat so my boss recommended me to go there and i loved it . Food was so delicious . I ate the chicken and beef combo rice was delicious the salad dressing is to die for . Loved the customer service and the menu was super plain and self explanatory"}
{"text":"Solid menu, good food, and great prices!   It's not a great location and reminisce of your \"hole in the wall joint\", but the place is clean and service is friendly, and they don't skimp on the meats.  For what I got, most places would charge $15-17 per plate.  I paid $10 plus tax and tip.  You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Was extra excited to try this place cause mixed plates aren't as plentiful in Toronto and I have fond memories of my experiences in Hawaii. Got the kalbi, chicken katsu, and small crunch roll mixed plate. The rice and mac salad portion was a little small even by lunch special standards. The chicken katsu was crunchy, but not oily. The sauce was especially good - tangy and thick. The kalbi was ok with some pieces having way more bone than meat. The best part of the meal was the crunch roll which tasted like a sushi roll with crunchy tempura bits. The rice in the roll was so fresh and soft while the sauce (mayo and something sweet and fruity) complemented it so well. Will be back but only for the crunch roll. The lady could have been a bit nicer. She didn't appear to be happy when I asked for extra napkins."}
{"text":"It replaced a great place called \"Well being in the box\". The quality of the food remained the same (Delicious with good sized portions), but the sushi part of the menu go cut down a lot. Although I miss the sushi selection, I would still recommend this place. Great Korean food. I would especially recommend the Chicken Katsu, Kalbi, and the Poke tuna."}
{"text":"Quality food with one of the lowest prices in town. Come here to get your hawaiian fix. Friendly and Excellent customer service. Worth a try! A++"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best Japanese/Hawaiian places I've been in, in Vegas. This place deserves to get big because they deserve it. It's a very small restaurant but the food here is amazing. I got the #37 Large and it was worth it. It was a big plate for only about $11. I suggest everyone to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Good food..anything you order here seems to be good  ..mango avocado salad was memorable..."}
{"text":"Update! Date night 9/28. My partner and I decided to revisit this place as he couldn't remember the last visit. This place is easily one of my favorite spots in town. 

There's a nice variety of Hawaiian meets Korean meets Japanese. The service was excellent, we really enjoyed the waitresses personality and attentiveness. 

We both got the large number 36, and split the tempura appetizer. There was so much food we both had essentially 1 to 2 more meals. 

I wanted the fish shaped ice cream but they were out. The waitress instead comped us two melon cream popsicles. Heaven!!!

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very clean, nice and very attentive staff thank you. We will be back my son ate all his food"}
{"text":"It's time for another review !
YOU STILL CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS PLACE !!
Consistency on flavor is on point. Got the combo plate and chicken teriyaki. If you're really hungry and looking for some BOMB ASS food. Come here. You will NOT REGRET it!!"}
{"text":"The Best teriyaki chicken in Las Vegas. If you havent tried this. This place should on your must go-to restaurant. Servers were very respectfull and friendly. I also tried #36 combo which comes with korean kalbi, katsu and crunch roll. It was amazing. I was very satified with their fooda and great service. I definitely recommend this place for anyone who have not tried."}
{"text":"This. Place.

Seriously. Mom's Teriyaki is the BEST. 

After searching Yelp for a good noodle/bento/sushi-type place, we saw some good reviews, trekked over, and have been HOOKED ever since.

The food is delicious. In the several times we have gone, we have tried noodle dishes, rice dishes, sushi, salads, etc. Each has been fantastic. When you look at their menu and smell the food cooking, you will want to order a bunch of stuff, there's no way your tummy will hold it all. The portions are big!

A nice plus is the fruit juices they sell have no HFCS. They also sell regular soda (Coke products) so you're set if that's your thing.

If you're on a tight budget, try to make it here on Saturdays. They have great specials from 10 until 3 *and* they throw in your choice of extra freebies (some free cans of soda, pot stickers, and other choices) if your order is over $20. 

This place is super clean. If you've read our other reviews, you know that's crucial for us for a dining establishment and we have been described as picky. 

In addition to being clean and well ventilated, the dining area has very tasteful and pretty decor. 

The same employee has helped us each time we have been here and she has been really cool and welcoming. 

The parking at Mom's Teriyaki is good because it shares a large lot with other businesses.

Sooo, typing this review made us crave Mom's Teriyaki AGAIN. It's been an entire week since we've been and will be on our way back as soon as I close the laptop. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Kalbi and Chicken Katsu plate was delicious! More people need to know about this place. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Moms Teriyaki had to be the best Teriyaki joint I've ever been to. It blows away Yoshinoya and other competitions, it's very simple yet very tasting and delicious and big portions. The server was friendly and even the main Cook Mom herself brought out my food. I ordered the following on an empty stomach

Chicken and Beef Teriyaki 4/5 chicken was not burnt and I believe this is more like bulgogi meat was had a nice flavor along with the excellent teriyaki sauce.

Chicken and Kalbi Teriyaki 4/5 nice flavors from the chicken and Kalbi ribs, generous portions.

CA Rolls 4/5 something so simple just tasted so good. 

Chicken fried rice 4/5 LOL I know how to make this fried rice the same way and I loved it.

Hawaii orange passionfruit drink 5/5 not to sweet and only $1.50 what a steal  

With hugh portions and excellent execution in taste and value Moms Teriyaki makes other Teriyaki place a run for their money."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast and delicious food. Got the teriyaki salmon bento box first time, then I tried the small lunch special with teriyaki chicken and the Korean noodles (delicious!) and it was only $6.95 for the smaller plate which is plenty of food! But if you are feeling extra hungry get the regular size or the bento box."}
{"text":"This place is cute, casual, and out of the way. The food was quick and delicious and with far better presentation than most other places! Affordable combos and great service! 

Will return!"}
{"text":"I was here with a coworker, we had some crispy crab meat wontons with cream cheese filling, so good I could've had like 10 of those, dangerous.. also had a spam Misubi, so good! The spam was like crispy good even flavorful and not overly rice stuffed! We also each had Chicken Katsu with rice and  macaroni salad, so good not over on the mayonnaise, the shredded cabbage is also really good with the sauce! Meat is so good, hardly any fatty, and so flavorful, soft. I had a full box of leftovers, the portion was rather large. I was bummed they no longer offer the loco moco and poke which is what I had in mind to eat but not bad."}
