{"text":"Chicago style deep dish pizza is the best. (I've ordered bacon & black olive & a pepperoni) tastes amazing and has the most delicious crust! Delivery came quicker than the estimated time."}
{"text":"These bread sticks are absolutely the best breadsticks in the tri-state area. Guaranteed. If you don't like it, find me and I'll eat the rest."}
{"text":"Today my hubby and I adventure ourselves to try this pizza place for the first time, I placed the order online and the promised time was 7:15pm, it was 7:23 and no sound at the door. We called and the person sounded kind of confused and busy until he decided to call the driver to check on the time and said he would be here shortly. Finally, he showed up and we were happy to see him.   We ordered two pepperoni rolls, a garden salad and a customized pizza with onions, ham, pineapple and pepperoni. Once I opened the box, my mouth started to salivate, it was very pretty to look at, the first bite ahhhhhhh......a delectable surprise, it had a nice interesting\"grilled\" flavor, even the smell, it reminded me of \"carne asada\", not greasy at all and I loved the fact that the meats tasted mild, not very salty like other places. I agree the crust could be enhanced but I liked it, sometimes simple finds a  strange way to satisfy you ;)    The pepperoni rolls were too soft for my taste with nothing special on them. The salad was the basic one, tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots; However, the Italian dressing I asked for was definitely homemade and that is rare to find specially in a fast food restaurant, bonus!"}
{"text":"Ordered some pizza from here this past Sunday evening. Along with the food, I also requested two sides of ranch. When the driver got to my apartment complex with the order, he called me and asked me to come down to the main entrance. I advised him that I'd opened that door for him so that he could come up to my apartment door, to which he let out an irritated sigh and, I kid you not, hung up on me. A few minutes later, he knocked on the door. When I opened it, he was standing with his arm already outstretched shoving the food at me. I said hi, and he did not respond, nor did he even look at me. I took the food and said thank you, and he rolled his eyes and left without saying a single word. Keep in mind I had pre-tipped while paying online, so he evidently no longer cared to provide decent customer service since he already got his tip. I had half a mind to call back and remove the tip I gave, but I didn't. Oh and by the way, he didn't bring the ranch I ordered, either. 2 stars because the food was ok, but definitely not worth the terrible service received.   ------  Decided to give this place another try this week. Updating my review from 2 to 4 stars. Driver this time was pleasant, did not hesitate to come upstairs, and even made some nice conversation at the door! Perhaps the first time around the guy was just having a rough day--understandable. 4 instead of 5 stars only because the pepperoni rolls didn't have much filling. Other than that, great!"}
{"text":"This review is for the stuffed pizza. I got a small stuffed sausage and pepperoni expecting a very mediocre attempt at the Chicago style pie. I was wrong. The stuffed pizza was excellent. Plenty of sauce to balance the cheese and toppings within. Only complaint is the crust doesn't have much to it. Perhaps a little brush of butter or garlic could help.   Also tried the pepperoni rolls (2 for $2.50) which were very good. Not a lot of filling, but very tasty. The Italian beef was the only thing I didn't enjoy. Bland meat that likely came from Walmart and saw little seasoning.   Stick with the pizza and you'll enjoy it. Prices are great for stuffed/deep dish pizza as well. The location feels like your classic pizza dive as well (take out or delivery only) with the alluring smell."}
{"text":"By far the best deep dish pizza in Madison. The pizzas I have had here, each many times: 1) Chicago Stuffed Pizza 2) Deep Dish Pan Pizza with Garlic Romano Crust  Both are amazing, and either one beats any other deep dish pizza I have had in Madison by a huge margin. 1) is truly massive and includes a top layer of crust (which is covered in an additional thin layer of sauce). 2) is my personal favorite because of the Garlic Romano Crust. This is not simply some flavoring sprinkled on the crust, but rather the entire bottom of the pizza has romano cheese and presumably garlic salt baked into it. It gives it an extra saltiness which is rather difficult to describe. It is amazing.   As others have noted, this place is quite hard to find. You will not see it from the street, so don't wait to turn until you do. Instead, pretend you are going to IHOP and go to the very back of the parking lot; there you will find Itzza Pizza."}
{"text":"Student special on pizza is the bomb. Friendly staff and food is always prepared extremely quick"}
{"text":"I hate to do this, really I do, but man, the Garlic Romano Deep Dish Chicago was the worst pizza of my life.  We had two pieces each and threw out the rest.  I actually went out and bought some other pizza from another west side location to rectify dinner.    Look, I bet if I were to flash back to my college days and order this beast at 2 am, I would be really, really happy.  Trying to feed a family and we need the quality to go up, significantly.  The crust was dry and falling apart, the sauce way to salty and the toppings lost.  I hate battering local places, and this is deserved based exclusively on the quality of the product.     I really really wanted to like this join, nice folks working there, easy to order, prompt service and the place is a little hard to find.  But damn, the pizza was not good."}
{"text":"I went and picked up a sandwich late night. The italian beef was amazing, there was some much food i had to save it for the next day."}
{"text":"Itzza Pizza is the replacement for Gumby's on Madison's near west side  I had the chicago style stuffed pizza and it was good (very big!), but nothing like authentic gino's east or lou malnati's in chicago. The sauce, crust, cheese, and toppings were pretty average and what you would find at places like pizza di roma or glass nickel, at a little cheaper price.  The one thing this place has that no one else does: PEPPERONI ROLLS. Gumby's had them and they were the best and these are even better!! They're soft, chewy, and come with a side of what tasted like thousand island dressing with a kick. Very awesome.  I would rank this place average in every single quality: taste, presentation, location, delivery speed. But the pepperoni rolls won me over. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I ordered a large pizza half pepperoni and half cheese, 10 wings (sweet and tangy), and breadsticks. The pizza was bland like glass nickle and other Madison shops. Nothing like east coast pizza. The wings were super small! I feel cheated. If you know what a normal wingding looks like ....Itzza pizza wings are 1/4 that size. Lastly, the breadsticks were not bread sticks at all. It was a freaking loaf of bread with oil and cheese. I don't know what this place is thinking but need to up their game or they will be out of business like Gumbys."}
{"text":"Extremely amazing Hawaiian pizza !  The Hawaiian pizza is one of the best I have had so far ! Great value for your money. I got the medium pizza and I think there was enough meat and pineapple on it for a large. Everything tasted really fresh and the delivery was within 40 minutes. Really fast for such fresh tasting pizza. Great crust too . I will definitely be ordering this again."}
{"text":"We read a review on the Cap Times (which is a garbage publication) and wanted to check it out. Their Italian Beef Meat Pie sounded awesome but after talking it up they left off the hot giardiniera that would have made the meal memorable. I called and complained and got a few bucks off of another order so next time we ordered a deep dish pizza. Their pizza wasn't all that memorable and we haven't been back."}
{"text":"I've recently tried both the thin crust and stuffed deep dish and they are both delish. The pizza sauce and cheese are top notch. The crust isn't quite there yet (a little too crunchy instead of buttery flakey) but is still good. The deep dish is very filling,  just one slice is a meal in itself. This place is a dive, no dine-in, just carryout or delivery, and looks like a dump but it smells amazeballs inside. Staff are very friendly and couteous over the phone and in-person.  This is my takeout pizza go-to."}
{"text":"Itzza terrible and disgusting.  I was recently visiting Madison for the first time in many years.  After a night at some bars, I wanted some food.  I had attempted to go to Ian's, but the huge line/mob was far too big for me to deal with.  I then decided  I was craving some pokey stix from Gumby's pizza.  Unfortunately, it turns out that Gumby's has gone out of business.  After some searching on google, it seems that Itzza Pizza has opened in the Gumby's location and offers up itzza sticks, which they claimed were like pokey stix, only better.  That statement couldn't have been further from the truth.    First off, they were an overpriced ripoff.  My $8.99 order came to just under $15.  There is really no way that tax and delivery came to roughly $6.  Unfortunately, I am not really sure of the price breakdown.  I decided not to question it as I was really craving something like pokey stix at ths point.  I just feel if you want to charge for delivery, have it listed on your website or menu.  What I received was inedible and disgusting.  The dough was undercooked, lacked seasoning, and was covered in far too much nasty mozzarella.  The cheese was some sort of fake, rubbery, oily, gelatinous, flavorless mess.  The only way to eat this was to pull off the cheese and drown it in ranch or marinara.  Even then it was still pretty nasty.    While I am not familiar with the local late night eats in Madison anymore, I am sure that there are many far better options than this place."}
{"text":"Pizza was not good at all. When I got the pizza It was warm but not hot. The pizza taste was terrible including the worst soggy crust. Not happy with the order and believe they need to seriously re-think what they are creating to keep customers."}
{"text":"I should have listened!  Read the other reviews that the pizza was too salty, but I figured those people were just pizza snobs and that everything would be delicious.  Wrong!  My lips were burning there was so much salt on our deep dish pizza.  I could hardly finish one slice.  Don't waste your time here, there are plenty of tasty pizza joints in Madison."}
{"text":"Love this place! My buddy lives right by them and I always order the pepperoni rolls with extra Itzza sauce on the side and they add it at no charge. Super cool people that work there. I normally order pick-up when I'm at my friends place but I just recently ordered delivery to my place on the west side. Took only 25 minutes from the moment I clicked submit order. Great pizza joint."}
{"text":"Wow this place is a mess, the employees do not care about customer experience and it shows.   Decent pizza but possibly the worst delivery times of any pizza place in the area, and we don't live far. We ordered here a few times and it always seems to take forever. Last time we ordered, it took over an hour and a half, the pizza was cold and they had forgotten an item in the order. They blamed it on their online ordering system and said that they could come back with the missed item.   Who knows how long that would've taken, so we gave back the congealed mush that may have one point been pizza, and told them not to bother. Don't order from here."}
{"text":"I gotta give these guys 4 stars because of the speed of delivery.  I don't know why in Madison most places are 50-60min to get a pizza these guys are usually to my door in about 30 min.  Give the thin crust a try it is pretty good."}
{"text":"The employees seemed interested in giving good customer service, but the size of the pizza was underwhelming for the price. Also, for ordering TWO toppings worth of chicken, I got about half or one third of the meat which I would have expected.  Overall, the pizza smelled and tasted pretty good. The sausage, pineapple, and sausage side was great tasting! Please though, Itzza, L'etiolle is the only place in Madison that should be getting away with skimping on portions.  **Turn into the parking lot on the East side of IHOP. Itzza Pizza is hiding behind (to the South) of that same IHOP.**"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a few times and usually enjoy it. However I ordered last night and my food never came! It's not the end of the world since my card wasn't charged, I was planning on paying in cash, but still frustrating because I stayed up until 330 am waiting! I called around 2 am and I was told they were really short on drivers and that they would come immediately when the driver came back and that they'd call. I never got the call and ended up falling asleep while waiting. Not the end of the world but I'm still frustrated! Update: I called and they delivered it to me for free! They were very nice about it also. Thank you!"}
{"text":"So I really am really conflicted, I love their food. When ever I crave pizza I order itzza. Today I wanted to treat the coworkers to some lunch cuz we had a very busy day, and I didn't want any of the girls to get hangry. Made a decent order I know it take time to make and deliver. Ordered around 11:30 on yelp, got conformation email saying it would take 60-75 mins, its cool. I was busy at work didn't mind, well 12:30 no pizza. I went to work on my guest so I couldn't call the business, checked my phone around 1:45 and I saw that I had 4 missed phone calls and a text from the driver? Saying they had to go???? Mmmmm I don't kno why they wouldn't go into salon isn't that the purpose of a delivery? Anyways I called the random number that texted me, a women answered she was nice enough. Said she was put delivering the last order, she would be there in 10. While I got the pizza but that wasn't until 2:15-2:30. Couldn't talk to the diver; I was working with my guest. it was weird because I saw her pull up and she had kids with her in the car. The pizza was cold, and hard. I paid 50 buck for cold hard pizza. We ate it cuz we all were hungry. Once I was off of work 4:10 I called itzza pizza, to let them know of my experience. I explained what had happened and their response was...... she is new. All I got was she is new.  I think it's safe to say I will not be ordering again, and I will not recommend this restaurant.  Bummer...."}
{"text":"Would give about 2.5 stars if I could. Had the regular pizza and breadsticks. Meh..  Not terrible, not memorable. Neither my husband or I cared for the sauce. Crust was ok. Definitely a lot of cheese if you like that. Generous with toppings. (Actually asked for mushrooms on half, got it on the whole pizza)   Breadsticks were just pretty bad. Came with an odd cup of sauce on the side. I actually think it might have been a mistake? Tasted and looked like a watery thousand isle dressing? Yuck. Otherwise the topping was decent but the breadsticks were very bready. I know, breadsticks, right? But they weren't chewy in a focaccia way or melty like Olive Garden.. They were more like garlic Wonderbread?  Overall, we thought we would give it a try but I wish I had spent my $16 elsewhere and we won't be back."}
{"text":"We LOVE Itzza Pizza! Their food is fantastic. The regular breadsticks and Itzza sauce are next level. We usually get the regular crust but recently tried the stuffed crust and it was great too. We come here about once a week and the food is always good. The service is fast too. I highly recommend if you're sick of chain pizza places. They do good bulk ordering/catering as well and offer great deals when you order multiple pizzas. I cannot recommend Itzza Pizza enough."}
{"text":"I got the garlic Romano deep dish and the delivery time was great. Topped with sausage and pepperoni, the pizza was average being mostly dough heavy with about one piece of each topping per slice. In my opinion, if they're going to charge for extra toppings at a price of $1.50 per extra, they should up the price and put a few more toppings on the pizza instead of just putting next to nothing on it. Underwhelming for the toppings but the overall experience was not bad."}
{"text":"We had a deep dish pizza, breadsticks and cinnamon sticks and instantly fell in love with this place!  The breadsticks are phenomenal!  Great flavor and some awesome dipping sauce to go with em.   The pizza was excellent- prefect crust to toppings ratio.  We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. Those who vote 4 stars are just afraid to admit it. Best Chicago stuffed in town (no kidding), sandwiches are perfect, service always great, and prices unbeatable. You're dreaming if you want better pizza take out in Madison, snobs take a hike."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Itzza Pizza.  I really find their Deep Dish fantastic.  I like the stuffed pizza too, but between the two, the deep dish wins it.  My only problem with the place is that they don't seem to apply coupons consistently.  I'm not implying dishonesty, rather I'm not sure the interpretation of each coupon on their end is universal.  Anyway, I'm very far outside of their delivery area I'll still order for pickup and hope I sail through the lights late at night."}
{"text":"I would never know this was here if not for yelp. The entrance is completely unmarked and I initially mistook it for the service entrance to IHOP (they are in the same building). I ordered online and showed up early to pickup, which seemed to be uncommon. They have only two chairs and it's quite dark and dingy inside. That being said, the pizza was pretty good and prices reasonable (medium cheese deep dish, large sausage/pepperoni, and noodles for $33). But I'd stick to delivery next time."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best pizza place I have tried in town.  I've eaten pizza at just about everywhere there is in Madison, and this place is the best.  I ordered their deep dish pizza with three toppings and I chose chicken, spinach, and feta.  The crust is completely out of this world. It has a buttery, flaky texture and a cheesy flavor as well. not sure how they make it, but by far the best crust I've had in a pizza. DELICIOUS.  12/18/15 *update* this place may have gone down hill a bit.  5 out of the last 6 times I've ordered, something had been made or done incorrectly and it takes a good 60 to 90+ minutes to arrive. Once a big fan of this place, finding myself ordering pizza elsewhere now"}
{"text":"Very salty...This place is hard to find..I was hoping for a good pizza..Was very dissapointed"}
{"text":"Went there with the hubby over the weekend and have some helpful tips:  First, - it's difficult to find. If you pull into the IHOP parking lot, it's right behind (but connected to) IHOP. You can' see it from the street.  The pizza was great, but as several other reviewers said VERY salty. I thought this would be an exaggeration after reading the reviews, but i definitely noticed that they used more salt than needed in the sauce. Although I could have done without some of the salt, it did not ruin the experience for us and I still thought the pizza was good. I would definitely order rom Itzza Pizza again.  Also, there is not indoor seating (there's a small table with 2 chairs to sit in while you're waiting to pickup, but that's it).  We expected that it would be small place, but thought there would be a few tables to dine-in. Not that case though.  We got the deep dish stuffed pizza and this is definitely the place to go in Madison if you're looking for something similar to authentic chicago style pizza."}
{"text":"1.  Here is a link to my (and a friend's) food Vlog (YouTube video) about ITZZA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpXIZ8DhQqY  2.  If you get an Italian sausage or sausage combo, as for no red sauce/marinara sauce/pizza sauce.  Inexplicably, ITTZA adds their red sauce to any sandwich with an Italian sausage involved.  I can see how you might want that if you're not getting your sandwich dipped in au ju, but I asked for mine dipped (as I always do) and they put red sauce on it, which clashed terribly with the au ju.  I've never known any other Chicago style restaurant to do this.  Scott, if you're reading, you might want to make it a thing, offer it dipped OR with red sauce, not both unless the customer asks.  I've already mentioned it to Mike.  Previous review:  I believe I have since tried all of the pizza variations.  The stuffed pizza is very, very good.  Better than others I've had in Madison.  Whether or not it ties with Giordano's I would have to try them side by side.  The regular/hand tossed pizza is also excellent, I would consider it thin crust, but it is not as thin as Chicago style cracker crust, or New York style.    The deep dish pizza is, as other reviews have said, very salty.  I believe it's the garlic romano seasoning blend they use in the crust.  I like it, but I have to be in the mood for it  Previous Previous review:  My new favorite place for Chicago/Italian-American style takeout.   Found them hunting for for a good Chicago style Italian beef, for which they exceeded expectations.  Best I've found north of Chicago, and better than a lot IN Chicago.  They arent generous with the toppings, so you will want to ask for extra.  I get mine with cheese, dipped, EXTRA au ju/gravy, EXTRA giardiniera.  Upon recommendations, I've also tried the deep dish pizza.  I'm normally not a fan, I prefer NY thin crust and Chicago stuffed.  I've also tried the pepperoni rolls.  My reaction to both was exactly the same:  at first, I found them ok, but at a later date, I found myself craving them.  I often get the calzone.  It's not the best I've ever had, but since Deli Roma closed, I havent found a better one in the area.  I have them make mine with breadstick dough instead of the regular dough.  I keep meaning to try the stuffed pizza.  I have no doubt it will be better than anywhere in Madison, but I doubt it will be as good as Giordano's.  I havent had anything bad.  Everything is solidly good to exceptional.  The owners are friendly and hardworking.  I encourage you to go."}
{"text":"Another great meal tonight!  Nothing better than a delicious pizza late at night when it is cold outside!!!  Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pizza place in Madison.  I think their pizza has a great flavor.  This is the only pizza place I have been ordering from lately."}
{"text":"I'll give them another try, though.  I love Chicago pizza and had high hopes, but the deep dish here was a big let-down.  I liked the crust and the breadsticks, so next time we'll try a different pizza.  Nice staff and quick prep."}
{"text":"Pretty good for pizza in Madison. If your looking for good value and a simple pizza this could be your spot. Their twists with the pepperoni in them are absolutely delicious. Worth just grabbing by themselves."}
{"text":"We ordered both the thin crust as well as deep dish pizzas, and we didn't care for either.  The pizzas included far too much SALT and other spices, which were probably someone's way of covering up for the fact that the ingredients weren't really fresh.    I've had tons of deep dish pizza in Chicago, as well as amazing thin crust in Milwaukee.  Unfortunately, Itzza just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"Sorely disappointed. We've ordered from here a few times and continue to order because we like the pizza.  We also enjoy the breadsticks but they always come undercooked and we have to bake them in the oven longer ourselves.  Also, twice now we have ordered the calzone, and it is not good to say the least. The first time it was dry and hardly had any toppings inside. We decided to give it another try and this time I was extremely disappointed to find meat in the calzone when I built it specifically as vegetarian. If it had been me who ate the meat it would not have been as big of a deal because I have not been vegetarian as long. Unfortunately, my boyfriend, a vegetarian of 8 years, ate the meat and became very sick because of it.  We had to throw the rest of the calzone out and cook something else. We specifically ordered out tonight because we got home late from work and did not have the energy to cook. It really felt like a waste of our time and money."}
{"text":"Delivery took 1.5 hours. Ordered 2 pizzas and only got one (that was cold). Very disappointing"}
{"text":"*Garlic Romano Deep Dish*  I'll get it right out of the way, the salt killed it for me. If this pizza weren't as salty as it is I'd easily give this place 5 stars. The crust is delicious but as I sit here drinking my fourth glass of water an hour after finishing eating, I just couldn't justify ordering it again. I love salt and only got through two slices. My other half took a few bites and said it was like eating a salt lick.  *Garlic Bread w/ Cheese*  Very solid. Definitely worth the few bucks they charge, not overly buttery (is there such a thing?) and not burnt. Just right!  I wanted to give this place 4 stars as a compromise but I'm just not certain it was a 'bad night' in terms of maybe adding too much salt to the sauce because other reviewers have pointed this out as well."}
{"text":"Perfect medicine while spending time with my father in UW Hospital. Pizza was ready as promised,  very tasty and came with an online coupon too. Hard to find location,  look behind the IHOP."}
{"text":"Very solid effort, rich decadent pizza.  Pizza doesn't really look like beautiful pictures on Facebook - crust is thinner and toppings do not fill up to the top as pictures of the garlic crust pan pizza seem to suggest.  I also expect pizza to be salty BUT DAMN this was SALTY."}
{"text":"Good pizza for a good price but the delivery driver was incredibly rude! Costumer service is everything people!!!"}
{"text":"So far EVERYTHING we've had delivered has been delish! My fav is the Hawaiian pizza and just tried the classic Italian pizza, OMG so good! Love their wings also, had the plain and bbq.  This place is my go-to for sure for pizza. Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best deep dish and thin crust Chicago style pizza I've ever had in Madison. And I was just ate at Lou Malinatis in Chicago a couple weeks ago. It was ok, but it was no Itzza Pizza! I can't wait to go get one today as soon as they open!"}
