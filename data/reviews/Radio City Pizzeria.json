{"text":"Poor service. Food was nothing special. I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"Second time at RCP:, and the last.  The first time just after they opened - limited menu, the wine I ordered was not in stock.  Understandable as they just opened.  As locals we were really looking forward to this restaurant providing another dining option downtown.  So we gave it a second try a few months later.  WORSE than the first time... !  Still the wine was not in stock and the beer we ordered was  not available.  Then waiting for the beer was painful  We could see the beautiful bar tender tending to everything except getting our beer as well as the beer for the adjacent table.  They ordered before we did.  The pizza quality was less than average.  I ordered a slice with peperoni and jalapeno.  The jalapeno looked as though it was thrown on the pizza as an afterthought.  It was not cooked into the pizza.  Then the exit, the wine that was not in stock had been charged to our bill, which required the manager to remove before we could pay with a credit card.  Wait, wait....wait.   No manager, no nothing...  Where does this manager hang out during lunch?  I offered to pay with cash and was told the manager still needed to remove the charge.  We gave them enough cash to cover the costs and left.  It seemed as a bother to the staff that we were there.  Too bad, we were really hoping for another eatery.  We will not be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good once we got the right one. Price was right for the product given the tourist environment. The waitress was a hot mess.  Ordered 3 beers and one coke. Got 2 beers and 1 coke. Asked about the other beer and got \"yes, it's on it's way\" as if the 3rd beer comes from a special place not near the other 2 beers. Ordered half pepperoni half sausage. Got half pepperoni half mushroom from a food runner. Said that was the wrong pizza. About 5 minutes later the waitress brought us the same wrong pizza. After another 20 or so minutes got the correct pizza. Never once asked if we wanted more drinks (there for over an hour), only saw the waitress to bring the pie and and check. The table behind us was ready to walk out after getting the wrong pizza 3 times, the manager came to their table and they stayed. Not sure if anything was offered to them. Manager never came to our table. I guess they are used to the wrong orders and that doesn't constitute a table visit.  In general tourists locations in Vegas have crap service so this didn't surprise me."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a weekday.   It was nearly empty, which is to be expected in that area at that time, I guess (although Le Thai always fills up for lunch).  We had the Las Vegas pizza and some garlic potato chips.  Both were just copmletely mediocre.  I can't slam them for being bad...but I can't say they were good either.  I can't think of a single reason to go back."}
{"text":"You can't beat the pizza, beer, atmosphere or staff; always friendly and fun. I won't eat pizza anywhere else. Radio City is a hidden gem in Vegas!"}
{"text":"At first I thought it was a fast food pizza place where you order, pay and grab a seat.  It's actually a sit down place.  The service is Awesome; they were very attentive.  I didn't even have to ask for ranch and they provided a large portion.    We ordered the meatball sub w/ homemade french fries and the chicken parm pizza.  All were amazing!  The chicken parm was delicious!  Each slice had a large piece of chicken; and the cheese was really good.  And the homemade french fries were so good.  It was crisp and wasn't oily.  It almost tastes like McDonalds fries but chunkier!  Our waitress recommended them and we are glad we tried it!  The prices are alright, considering it is in Tivoli Village.  We will definitely come back to try the other items."}
{"text":"Totally wanted to be on board and welcome RCP to downtown. Well I jumped the gun!  We ordered the parm fries. Awesome! Came out in 7 mins. Then the pizza 18\" custom pie...waiting... waiting.. um..still waiting. 40 min.later I asked for the bill,said just cancel the pizza and then.. it appears. So we ask for it to be boxed to go, and then wait and wait. Um still waiting then proceed to WAIT to PAY by credit card. So over it..get to my car and open the box to grab a piece on the drive home. OMG ! Not even my PIE. Lance (our server) got our order TOTALLY wrong or gave us the WRONG pie. I have a salty doughy tough pizza crust with Ham ...I ordered a salami, meatballs, black olives, jalapeños with fresh tomatoes.So I decide to call them while I drive around the block but the call goes straight to a recorded message. Now I have NO CHOICE but to YELP."}
{"text":"We stopped in because we happened to be in the area, although I wouldn't normally visit a development with the word \"Village\" in it.  Of course I have a pretty hard time passing up $0.50 PBRs too.  Fist off the PBRs hit the spot, at that price I'm sure they're dispensing enough of it to maintain it at the peak of freshness.  We also had a few Moretti's for $1.50, another bargain but I don't think that's a daily deal.  We shared a little house/side salad.  For $5 I'm not sure I got a lot of value out of that.  Just a clump of greens on a plate.  We then split a 12\"  BBQ Chicken Pizza for $15.95.  That's probably the most I have ever paid for a pizza that size.  It was good but it certainly hasn't had me dreaming about it ever since.  I'd be just as happy with a frozen California Pizza Kitchen pie for $5.  Actually I'd be happier because then I'd have enough money for 22 more PBRs.  Normally we would order a large pizza so we'd have something to take home, but only some pizzas are available in the large size.  This would lead one to believe that the pizzas are made ahead of time.  Who knows, but I think it's sort of a dumb way to set up the menu.   What really caught my eye though was a parmesan chicken sandwich that I saw sitting on the counter, wow, that thing looked tasty!  Atmosphere?  Not much going happening on a Sunday afternoon.  A few trust fund babies at the bar sort of made me hope that's not the normal crowd.  In summary I found the food to be okay but not worth the price.  Factor in the cost of the beers though and you'll come out even on the bill compared to most other places."}
{"text":"Pizza OK. Pricey unless you keep it simple. Understaffed [waiters] for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Not sure which was worse, the food or the service. Hmm..probably the service. The bartender was too busy to take your order because she was talking with a friend and eating at the end of the bar and the one waitress for the entire place was not friendly or helpful. The whole place seems incredibly disorganized. I was hoping the food would make up for it, but it was pretty disappointing too. We had the chicken bbq pizza that is supposed to be one of their best pizzas. Sadly, I've had better out of the microwave. I suggest going elsewhere!"}
{"text":"The bartender was slurring her words and clearly wasted. She had a hard time taking our order and carrying out simple requests like requesting a channel or water; and we were the only 2 people in there. The cook actually ended up having to remind her. She was sweet tho, just drunk. Not much of a selection of beer but the food was good. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Hmmm, I am so torn...  If not for the pizza, this place would be a solid 4 stars. Usually, I'd only drop it down to three stars and say, \"stay away from the pizza,\" but, well, if you are a pizza joint, it just doesn't work that way.  The desserts here get 5 stars! I had a cannoli, it was perfect! The sweet ricotta was just the right level of sweet, the shell was firm, but not dry. One of my friends had a chocolate covered one and he said it was excellent as well.   The sides are also very yummy. The garlic knots are well seasoned and melt in your mouth.  The setup is nice, with plenty of seating, including an outdoor patio and an indoor bar. The patio provides a view of Fremont. The bar has a decent selection of alcohol with a few more specialized liquors you won't necessarily find everywhere else.  The service is also good, with staff that is friendly and accommodating. even when the place is clearly slow and they're probably not making what they should be in the way of tips compared to other Fremont Street servers on a Friday night, they still stay cheery and aim to please.  But, the pizza. It's badly made and clearly with the wrong cheeses and wrong seasonings in the sauce. The pizza here tastes like the horribly over sweetened crap you get at dominos. Or used to get at dominos. I think even dominos has figured out how to make a better pizza at this point (not GOOD, mind you, just BETTER).  We ordered a white pizza and a regular one, so the problem was not one pizza alone. Everything was bad.  If you've already had dinner, it's a nice place to grab dessert and drinks on the patio. Just stay away from the pizza."}
{"text":"As Vegas locals, we watched RCP fail at Tivoli in Summerlin and were disappointed when we had eaten there because the pizza was priced well above the average west coast slice and didn't seem to be worth it (even though we had high hopes that a Tivoli pizzeria would offer a up-scale option. When RCP moved downtown to East Fremont Street, we hoped they'd do well and decided to give them a try again. On our first visit with out-of-town friends at 11pm on a Saturday night, we waited 20-30 minutes for 4 slices of pizza, and after asking our server when the pizza slices would be ready, we were told that the \"kitchen missed receiving our order\".  We walked out as we were not willing to wait any longer for 4 slices of pizza.   My wife and I decided to give RCP yet another try a couple weeks ago, thinking maybe the service was slow/lacking on our previous visit as the East Fremont location had just opened at the time.  This second visit turned out to be no different than the first.  My wife and I sat at the bar, waiting for a server to come and take our drink and pizza order, while the restaurant was 50% full on a Friday night around 11pm.  Three servers/bartenders were huddled near the end of the bar, all laughing at something they were looking at on their cell phones, completely oblivious to the fact that we had sat down at the bar and were waiting for service.  After 5-10 minutes, we waved to the servers/bartender to try and get their attention, but were unsuccessful in doing so.  Once again, we walked out, and went across the street to Uncle Joe's pizza where we ordered drinks and slices of pizza and were seated and eating within 5 minutes.  I will not waste anymore time ever going to RCP again in the future, and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  We highly recommend going across the street to the real pizza parlor - Uncle Joe's if someone is looking for pizza in the downtown Fremont Street area!!  Only reason I am even giving RCP one star is because of it's location."}
{"text":"I could eat the garlic chips all day. Their .50 beer is great deal. Their pizza is good also. Would give it 4 stars but the host few months back was very rude and condescending. She's young so I'll try to not take it too personally but humbleness and humility will go a long way. Just few days ago, the waitress brought out the wrong order too. I like this place enough to go back but with better service, I think this place has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Just moving from NYC to Vegas, I was longing for a good NYC styled pizza... and this was it. I love this PLACE!"}
{"text":"We were greeted by an awesome young lady who sold the brand.  Unfortunately while we waiting for a table the owner and manager made comments about our party leaning against the jukebox.  So they have a free jukebox that you can play....if you ask them to turn the \"IPod\" down.  I question the managers why they would offer something for free if it came with restrictions and they said that is our choice!!  So our choice was to leave!!  I understand conceptual values, but this made no sense!!   Good luck!  I will not spend my hard earned money here!"}
{"text":"Not great service.  Better then average pizza , but it cost a 30% more then the pizza place across the street that is also very good."}
{"text":"Great place to start a casual night out-- grab some pizza and some drinks.  DJ on Friday is awesome... Ciroc Vodka is the well vodka so stop on by and grab a $5 dollar vodka soda and have some fun!"}
{"text":"Was intrigued by the homemade parmesan garlic chips and wanted to give them a try to use as a gauge for whether I would order anything else.  Big mistake.  For $7, all I got was a small tray of very burnt chips sprinkled with parmesan cheese and garlic salt.  And I'm not talking about just a few burnt ones here and there -- I would say literally 99% of the entire order was what most customers would described as burned.  Perhaps if the amount of chips had been twice as large or the price closer to $4, I would not have felt as ripped off.  At the prices this place charges, you expect some superior quality.     As much as I'm all for helping out the small restaurant owner, this small thing really did leave a horrible first impression.  If I had looked at the chips before I left, I would've probably sent them back, but it was a to go order and I didn't really look at them until I was half-way home.  Oh well.  Needless to say, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza, at best. I was expecting more.   Replace the canned toppings with fresh and put less salt in the sauce.  PBR was warm.  Staff was friendly.   Bus-boy kept putting dirty dishes on the counter where I was eating."}
{"text":"This is our second visit to this place. Unfortunately the service was so bad, it forced me to create this account and allow people to know how bad it was. The waitress acted high and inattentive to anything going on around us or her, completely oblivious. Food is good but waiting 30 minutes after getting our drinks with only five total tables full to get our order taken."}
{"text":"The $5 for 2 slices and a drink is what convinced me to try this place. I ordered a slice of pepperoni and a slice with mushroom and a soda and I ended up being very disappointed. I was looking to fill up before heading out to dance at a club til 4AM but ended up being disappointed.  First the waitress forgot my drink order. She served my boyfriend the soda he had ordered but didn't serve mine even though I had ordered first. About 5 minutes later she showed up and I told her she had forgotten my soda and she got one right away.  Our pizza showed up and it was quite mediocre. I've never had bad pepperoni pizza before but this one I had to force myself to eat. The mushrooms were not tasty either. Adding red flakes made it a little better but I barely ended up eating half my food. My boyfriend told me he thought the food was mediocre as well. Definitely not eating there again. I'd take my luck with the pizza place across the street next time."}
{"text":"The food saved the day by being well above average but it's hard not to be negatively influenced by the 45+ min wait on a Thursday afternoon. Couple that with inconvenient parking and it's a bad mix for a business lunch. Call ahead or don't bother. There are too many better pizza joints that get the same thing done in a much faster and friendlier way. A lot of this could have even been remedied by the staff acknowledging the delay in someway."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place closed. The food was overpriced and not good plus horrible service. I can cook a better pizza in 2-3 mins in my Dad's bbq grill. I really hope something good or interesting open there."}
{"text":"DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!! Chicken club pizza was bland and boring, fries and honey mustard were pretty good. Service was the worst part.. Drinks were empty almost the whole time when I did ask for refills they only brought 1 and there was 2 of us. After our meal we sat there for 10 min waiting while there entire staff was standing around just talking. We got our bill and they asked if they could box up the pizza and after a few minutes we saw our waiter sweeping the floor. He tossed our pizza he was supposed to box up. Now maybe I could forgive some of these things if they were swamped but there was only 1 other occupied table in the place!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible pizza as well as chicken wings. The chicken wings were mostly fried badder without any chicken; also, the cheese on the pizza was very rubbery. My friends and I found it to be almost inedible. Great location, bad for the party goers who stumble in and end up suffering through eating their over priced pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza and good service with a smile! Plenty of TVs to kick back have a beer and watch a game and well worth the visit every time I need a quick bite and in the downtown Las Vegas area! The rest of menu looks great too however can only speak for the pizza! It's super close to Jersey/New York style pizza (thin flimsy crust and great sauce) and it's reasonable priced!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time at this unorganized mess of a restaurant.   Made a reservation with the hostess got to the restaurant and reservation was never put in. Then we had to wait for 20 minutes for a table. After we sit (5 ppl at a 4top) table it takes 12 minutes for anyone to come take our drink order or even greet us telling us it will be a minute. Just for anyone who hasn't seen the restaurant there is maybe 10 tables for inside seating.   Service staff & front staff are so unorganized here you really just want to slap them. Poor management starting with the owner. If you are going to comp someone then you still take care of them as a paying guest.  I told the waitress we rather pay then get the meal comped even though the whole place was horrible.    The only reason this place might do well is because of tourists and the fact that the pizza place across the street sucks worse. Go to Grimaldi's and avoid the crap of mess the restaurant is.  Service horrible, food is average no big deal and management sucks. Only good thing is the bar staff."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there.  The chicken wings were thick and juicy.  The sauce had a great flavor but wasn't hot.  I could haved used a little more spice but it was definitely flavorful.  I had a slice of Pepperoni pizza and it was good.  Looking forward to trying the Chicken Parm sandwich with the Parmesan Cheese chips next time."}
{"text":"Great food  fresh ingredients what more needs to be said  had the philly cheese .she had the chicken sandwich both were really good definitely give them a try"}
{"text":"This is a great place! They do by the slice on pretty much any pizza they offer and their pizza is good! I had a green pizza which had watercress and brussel sprouts- it was delicious and it had thin NY style crust (my favorite).  They're totally revamping the place which is cool. They also have a great craft beer selection and a full bar. I had an incredibly approachable saison using hoshino yeast and brewed with cherries."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I'm a firm believer in trying everything twice, but the service has consistently failed to reach mediocre. The food is alright; however, I now feel the only reason I rated it \"alright\" is simply for the service aspect. Our server was amazing and polite given the circumstance.  Every time I have come to visit this establishment the server has been struggling to make ends meet. He can't touch every table in an acceptable amount of time because he is the ONLY server!!! Step up your scheduling, management!  I had ordered the wings to go and sat down with some friends to enjoy dinner at that particular moment. We waited over 20 minutes to be acknowledged, walked up to the bar to get some drinks and a menu, and still had to flag down the server to take our order. After an hour of eating and talking I still had not received my to-go order. I had to search for the server and bring it up. The order was never placed. We didn't end up waiting for the wings and opted instead to just leave. I had such high hopes...but I will try it again. Maybe things will get better?"}
{"text":"I work in Tivoli Village and often eat at the pizzeria multiple times a week. I love how convenient it is for me to walk in and buy a slice of this crispy oozing goodness on my lunch break. I also really like the salads especially the Vanilla Shallot dressing. They also have great service especially the owner/ manager when he is around he is always making sure we are takin care of! I will continue to eat at the pizzeria because I know the staff is great and high quality fresh food makes it hard to resist!"}
{"text":"Wow! RCP is a weekly run for myself and my brothers family(two small children includes!). And for 6 weeks in a row it has been perfect. Havent seen any of the issues other people seen to find! Thick or under cooked crust??? Nope perfectly crispy outside and cooked inside!!! As far as it being thick, the crust is thinner than any pan pizza you get from the other delivery places. Sauce is great perfectly cheesed each time!! The antipasto plate is HUGE and a great price!!! And  really.50$ PBR!!!! yeah ding ding ding winner. As for the service....100% amazing!!! Drinks are never empty, food comes out fast and hot and all of the servers have been nothing but attentive! Even when the place is 100% full!!(which yes is easy  its pretty small inside and a few out door tables)  Now for the atmosphere....its a New York joint!!! Unless you thought it was a different Radio City????? New York sports on the tube...lots of NY love...and being a New Yorker this is HEAVEN! I dont really write reviews...nor frequent places that dont rock....this place is amazing!!  See ya next week!!!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service in downtown LV. Was told they had vegan pizza, but it;s only if you order a whole pizza I just wanted a slice or two for lunch. Bit of a let down but I got the lunch special two slices and a soda.The slices were fricking huge so two pieces was almost too much. My glass was never empty."}
{"text":"If this isn't the best pizza place in town, their dough and sauce absolutely are. Coming into Tivoli Village and seeing a place that's actually reasonably priced was a great feeling. All in all, this is a must try, the food and service was great and my girlfriend and I had the Homemade Garlic Parmasean Chips and a small White Pizza, both were awesome. Can't wait till their bar is up and running, we'll be there to watch the games. Highly Recommend !!!"}
{"text":"2 stars is strictly for the food so here's the deal:  5 stars because we were able to bring our dogs and enjoy a meal! 5 stars for $.50 PBRs 5 stars for the service, they reappeared outside frequently, acknowledged the need for a refill on the beverages and asked if we would like some water for the dogs 2 stars, unfortunately, for the food.    I was super excited to try this restaurant because they offer vegan cheese.  We ordered a vegan pizza with sliced jalapenos and roasted garlic for me & a \"normal\" veggie pizza for bf.  We were half way through our pizzas (we were really hungry) when we both looked at each other, stopped chewing and realized our dissappointment.  The crust was tough, neither of us could taste the sauce and couldn't decide if it was a lack of flavor from the sauce or not enough on the pizza.  The toppings were very skimpy and we both were looking for salt - who puts salt on a pizza?  If anyone from Tivoli or the restaurant reads this, can I suggest to have the produce truck that parks across from your location move?  I realize it is only there during the Saturday market but it is loud, runs constantly and was the reason we left the restaurant in a bad mood.  No one wants to eat a meal 10 feet away from a running moving van."}
{"text":"Was greeted imminently, very good service by MIMI. Our first visit there was very surprising after trying to find out what we wanted to do everything ended up great very nice friendly people loved the concept completely. Will be back very soon(:"}
{"text":"This joint just opened a few weeks ago.  I ate here last week Wednesday (2/27) Highly anticipated because of their location. The setting is nice and modern.  They have a full bar so that's a plus.  The bartender is gorgeous and the waitresses are easy on the eyes as well.    The pizza was pretty good, not the best I've had, but it did the job.  The menu was limited, I think they were still going through their soft opening.  They only had about 5 selections.  They have a bunch of TV screens up, playing mostly sports.  Their kitchen is in plain view and you can see your pie being made.    Our waitress, god bless her, was nervous and you could tell she was new to the service industry.  We ordered 2 large pies and it took a really long time to come out.  The place wasn't that crowded too.  I'm assuming it's because they're still new and trying to get use to everything.  I'll update this review when I go there again, but right now, it's just okay with potential."}
{"text":"New menu and management have completely turned this place around...Chorizo pizza is the sureshot!"}
{"text":"Whether your planning an event, having a celebration or bar hopping on east Freemont, RCP is a place you must check out. Having a variety of specials and great affordable prices you can't lose walking in. The menu is large so I guarantee you can full fill whatever craving it is that your having. Now since it's known for pizza I personally know that their dough recipe is homemade and prepared on premises as well is their marinara sauce. Oh did I mention they make all there sauces including almost every single side and salad dressing from scratch. As well as there sauces my most recent favorite item is there homemade mozzarella sticks they are to die for! RcP offers a lot of great items to choose from, amazing 5 dollar shots and even open late. My kinda place! It can be yours to, check it out"}
{"text":"The pizza was good. The salad was great. The chicken fingers are amazing!!!! Probably the best chicken fingers in Las Vegas. Friendly Management and Staff. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer.  Best place to watch sports.  Incredible pizza!  Must get the garlic parm wings.   The staff is really friendly, and I'd highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Great pizza in downtown Las Vegas! Staff was super friendly! Full bar service, great craft beer! Very clean place, great prices, too!"}
{"text":"Excellent version of NYC Pizza. The white cheese is excellent with chicken. Would recommend this place if you like thin crush pizza and a pizza that doesn't make you stuffed after eating. Staff was nice and friendly. Would definitely go back.  Great place to grab late night pizza craving."}
{"text":"Fremont East has a number of new eateries open recently. Le Thai, Comida and Park on Fremont are at the top of my list. Radio City Pizza had also piqued my interest so we grabbed dinner with friends Sunday night. When we walked inside, the bartender mentioned the A/C was broken, but we were welcome to take a seat. We asked if the beer was cold? \"Yes\" the bartender replied. That's all we needed to know. We figured we'd be in and out fairly quickly so the heat wouldn't be a bother (but we were wrong).   We were the only table seated, but service was slow from the start. It's a fairly long and narrow space with a long bar, open kitchen and tvs line the dining area. Oddly enough for a brand spanking new place the color isn't accurately adjusted on a single one. Anyhow, the beer selection is good. Unfortunately, the beers weren't nearly as cold as advertised and the quickly heated as a result of no A/C. After our first beer we chugged water to keep cool.   We started with parmesan fries, we devoured them before I thought to take a picture. They were real good, nice and crisp with a heavy dose of parmesan. We had to ask for the ranch  (weak) we ordered on the side a few times before we received it. Next, we ordered the Meat Stromboli and Pizza with sausage, mushrooms, olives  and green pepper. We waited forever for our order. There was filming taking place over by LVCS and the crew came in for a dozen pizzas. This must have backed up the kitchen. Our waiter never mentioned a thing, it's just our assumption based on observation. While waiting a couple in our group went to use the restroom, when they returned they noticed that Radio City has outside dining in back. We were a bit perturbed that it wasn't offered to us as an option when they mentioned the A/C was broke. We questioned our waiter and we were told that it was an owners private function.   Back to the food, the stromboli and pizza looked appetizing. I was happy to see they use slices of italian sausage rather than sausage crumbles. The crumbles remind me of cafeteria food and weird me out a bit. I'll never understand why some places prefer it that way, but I digress. The crust was chewy and crisp about 3/4 through the pizza. It suffered the wet center that majority of NY Style pies do. Both the stromboli and pizza were extremely high in sodium. I couldn't get enough to drink. I retained enough water I could've soaked up Lake Mead. I've had worse pies, but just down the street at Pop Up Pizza inside Plaza they're doing a better job at a cheaper price. And they have A/C. Our friends picked up the tab, so I'm not sure what the final damage was, but if I recall accurately pizzas are $19, Stromboli is about ten bucks and the fries were $7. In any case, Radio City has some work to do. Starting with its customer service."}
{"text":"One of the 1st steps to having a successful business is having a great product...  These guys have a great product at a great price.  Come in for the .50 cent PBRs (Yup .50 cents... I know I know 20 beers for $10... exactly)  Anywho... Stay for the great pizza.  New York style crust... Thin chewy... Perfect toppings... and cheap!  Boo ya!  Andy, whom I can guess is the new manager... Maybe... Is great and has seemed to have hired a whole new team of people that are attentive and personable.    If you're a pizza fan, check this place out... If you like to drink for cheap, check this place out..."}
{"text":"RCP is awesome! My husband and I rented out RCP for a family gathering the night before our wedding and all I can say-- everything was perfect!! We worked with the manager Brian and he made everything go so smooth for us. The wait staff was kind and incredibly on top of it- Brian and his team were fantastic at accomodating our large group of 50. The pizza- WHOA- delicious! Everyone loved it! Quality pizza! The wings and the salad were delicious, too! This was the perfect, PERFECT place for our family to gather and get to know one another- I would HIGHLY recommend RCP not only as a place to grab a pizza but also to have a great party. Great food and incredibly affordable! Thank you to Brian and his team!"}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever.  A guy and a girl with tattoo-style stockings (or maybe they weren't stockings) gave us the cold shoulder for twelve minutes with no acknowledgment.  I would have been out in three, because the place wasn't that busy, but it was my wife's b-day.  Finally, even she gave up.  On the way out, the waiter looked surprises.  Really?  The girl was still arranging napkins and pizza stands and probably didn't notice our departure."}
{"text":"Stopped at Radio City Pizza for lunch and only because Big Ern's BBQ at Container Park was closed (at 12:30 on a Sunday. I don't get it.) and the Mexican joint there was packed. Have three kids with me so I thought, can't go wrong with pizza. Only, yes, you can. Enter Radio City Pizza.   Ordered the pizza special, two slices and a drink for $5. Good deal, I thought. And it is a good deal. Only, it isn't good pizza. Pizza came out really quickly, like within a minute so, it'd definitely been sitting around a while. At first sight, it reminded me of Costco pizza (and that's a good thing). Slices were both large, with the right amount of sauce and the right amount of cheese. But it really wasn't good. The cheese was congealed and the crust was hard. Not crispy or chewy. Just hard. My daughter actually said she wished we were at Pizza Hut. That bad.  I ordered the sausage and peppers appetizer but was told they were out of sausage. Ugh. So I looked at my other options and ordered the salmon salad. Oops, because they were out of salmon, too. Our server explained that by the end of the week, they're out of most things. It's Sunday, prime lunch time on Fremont St. Time to think about stocking up closer to the start of the weekend, rather than the end. Anyway, she suggested the apple salad with chicken added. Rather than going for a third strike and ordering something else from the menu which they were out of, I went with her suggestion.   The salad is described as mixed greens, blue cheese crumbles, apple slices, whole walnuts, and cranberry-pomegranate dressing. What I got was a bed of mixed greens which were tossed in balsamic vinegar and a few slices of apples. Honestly, that was it. Not a single crumble of blue cheese, not a single walnut. And there is no way that dressing was anything other than balsamic and olive oil. It reminded of a salad you'd get at Carls Jr because you're trying to eat healthy. It was awful. And the added chicken was so, so, so bad. Chopped up tiny pieces of super dry chicken. Terrible.  Despite this place being really close to my office, I won't be back. And I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Dined here 3 times and every time pizza was consistent and great... I couldn't stop at just one slice.. Service is prompt and attentive, manager and staff are very friendly and drinks r priced just right and every day it seems like they have a drink special going on.. Great ambiance, and they always have the game on for u sports lovers.."}
{"text":"Stopped in just for a quick lunch of two slices.  Told the girl at the counter I wanted the two slice special with soda for $7.00.   She asked if it was to dine in or to go, I told her I was just going to sit outside and she said she would bring it out.  Five minutes later another server comes out and asks me what I had ordered.  She said she was going to get my soda.  She made it seem that I had to go inside to get my soda so I did and she just handed it to me.  A few minutes later the initial server brought my two slices out.    After finishing I went inside to pay and the second server said she would be right with me.  There were several employees behind the counter but no one offered to help me out at the register for some reason.  She then went on to bring another table their bill, then brought a pizza out to another table, then got a refill for another table, and then finally went to print out my bill.  I gave her a tip but wish I didn't as the service was just time consuming.  A little helpful hint if you are just going to get a couple slices, just tell them it is to go and then go outside to eat if that's your plan.  I don't know if she was just looking for a tip for service but I would have preferred just to pay for my slices and soda at the register to expedite the whole process.  Feel like it took twice as long as it should have to just get a couple slices of pizza and pay the bill, and they weren't very busy.  The pizza is good but the service leaves a little to be desired even from other times we have been there."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed eating at Radio City since it was at Tivoli. The service has always been excellent and friendly. As a native New Yorker, Radio City has kept the NY style pizza and added some flair in their specialty pizzas. My favorite pizzas are the Viva Las Vegas and White pizza. My friend loved the gluten free crust. This weekend we had the buffalo wings, the were huge!"}
{"text":"Swung by here for lunch after an appointment downtown! Service is so fast and the good vibes just adds to your day! Order the vegetarian pizza****"}
{"text":"We are here last night. We ordered the vegetarian pizza and our waiter recommended the Winter Squash pizza. It has a spaghetti squash base topped with mushrooms and pickled squash. We decided to go for it. When it can out it looked delicious. One bit and we were in love (with the pizza)! Every bite was bursting with flavors. The crust was perfect although we didn't want to eat it all so we could enjoy more of the amazing pizza. By the end of our meal we both agreed that was by far the best pizza we have ever hàd! You have to try it! The waiter said the chef may be adding it to the menu. Cannot wait to savor this awesome pizza again... Very soon."}
{"text":"Pizza is great, they have an awesome meatball sub and PBR FOR 50 CENTS!  A PITCHER IS $2.  Wow.  Very New York flavor... usually have games on (important ones with sound).  Have a small bar to belly up to.  Great spot in Tivoli village."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and you have to try the meatballs! Great place to watch a game and was especially fun during March Madness (lots of TVs). It's very clean, staff is nice and love the atmosphere on Fremont East.  Favorite pizzas here: White Pizza and Buffalo Chicken Pizza.  I also like the kind of fries they serve here with sandwiches - skinny but still flavorful!   They also have a nice back patio - in addition to the front patio - for when it's nice out. Good selection of beer.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. My first visit was the other day and I can assure you it won't be my last. The staff is more than welcoming, the prices are reasonable, the atmosphere is great and the food is amazing. .50 PBR drafts all day everyday!"}
{"text":"First time here. Been wanting to try it. Very limited menu. Mostly very odd, gourmet pizza choices. Not very appetizing sounding so I went for what they call NYC style pizza. I'm from NYC. Not even close. The pizza was paper thin, soggy, falling apart and overpriced. The Buffalo wings were pretty good though. I doubt I would go back unless it's just for wings & beer."}
{"text":"Bad experience here ! I went with some friends and a young waitress was very rude from the start gave us very bad service . We asked her to split the check and told us to just divide it ourselves , we defiantly wont be back . The manager though was nice he came and spoke to us ."}
{"text":"WOW!!! The food here is beyond amazing! My girlfriends and i went shopping at Charming Charlies to decide where we gather for a glass of wine. Susie recommended Radio City...I'm hooked! The antipasta plate is the BEST in the city, the chicken parm pizza and white pizza are a \"do not miss\". I cant think of going to Tivoli without stopping at Radio City...the wine list is phenom too!!! WOW!"}
{"text":"Highly NOT Recommended! Service is horrible and the pizza is not worth the wait. My husband wanted to try it, because he really likes pizza and it was a new spot to try. We did get seated right away and the busser brought water out right after we sat, but then thats all we did for almost 20 mins before our waiter showed up to take our drink order. At that point water was just fine, because who knew how long it would take for him to come back and take our food order. We asked about the special on the board, he recommended it and said it was good. He did inform us it would take 20 mins for the pizza, we said that was fine. A runner brought our pizza and then our busser brought our plates out after and he also placed a slice in each plate for us. There on out we had to ask our busser for things, because we never saw our waiter after the order was taken. To top it off the seating area is horrible, way too close together, i lost count on how many butts passed my face while eating with people going in and out the area. Overall I would not recommend this place nor ever go back myself, service is horrible and pizza was way too salty. My huband said he'd rather had gone to little ceasars for $5 pizza instead and he doesnt even care for that pizza...but i do agree with him!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night at 7p when everything else around seemed to be packed full with a 40+ min waiting list. Not sure why this place was empty...It's a cool little place with a full bar and some good food. We split the duck pizza and it was really good. We each tried one of their specialty cocktails and while they were both good, they were a little gin-heavy for us whiskey drinkers. The atmosphere is good for both casual and a date.   The service was good, but the kitchen was a bit slow -- not sure why with only two tables filled. We entered with plenty of time, and by the end were looking for our check so we didn't miss the opening of our next event. The only other minor complaint is that when the place is that empty, you can seat two at a 4-top so we have some room to move. As is the fashion these days, they already have a lot on a very small tabletop.   That said, we'll be back. Especially if they stay this empty."}
{"text":"Never will I be coming here again! After waiting over an hour, our pizza was absolutely disgusting! Also the service was so bad, the manager gave me back my credit card saying the meal was on him yet I WAS STILL CHARGED! Unbelievable! Thanks for nothing Radio City...."}
{"text":"Hooray!!!!! Vegan mozzarella means those of us who don't do dairy can actually order a pizza. Kudos to this new establishment for realizing this niche. They also offer gluten free and whole wheat crust.  Hooray #2- since it is located in Tivoli Gardens and has outdoor seating, it was awesome to be able to bring our dog to the party!! We sat outside at the shaded tables and had a great time!!  Good, attentive and friendly server. The only thing she did that was irksome to my husband was ask if we wanted dessert or \"just the check\" right after we started eating. I had just started my second piece of pizza. Would be helpful if they offered their employees a bit if service training even though it's a pizza place. A dirty table sat next to us our whole dinner.   Here is some more food for thought: A few inconsistencies to what was an otherwise awesome experience....... VERY simple menu. Normally this wouldn't be a biggie, but the offered pizza toppings lacked pizzazz. Loved the roasted garlic purée, but everything else was very basic, like they don't know the clientele they are serving. Plain button mushrooms? The menu offers a roasted veggie panini. Perhaps you could offer those veggies on your pizzas. ?? Even meat eater options were boring.  No specialty combo pizzas offered.    Next, The green salad was a cup of mixed field greens and 2 tomato slices on a salad plate which was brought out with  red wine vinegar and oil. I asked for a balsamic vinaigrette and was brought the same balsamic reduction (thick!!!) that was on my husbands caprese salad.  For pennies, you could create a decent salad and dressing. Head over to Tivolis Saturday Farmers Market and pick up a few things if you need to, but don't insult customers with lettuce on a plate. Especially Summerlin customers in the food service industry.  Also, throw out an order or breadsticks or your garlic knots or even your potato chips for people while they wait.  We waited a good time for even our salads and had nothing to pick on. Just might be a nice touch to serve a breadstick or two with the $5 plate of greens and $8  caprese salad, too.  Drinks: The ice tea had run out at 5 PM and the root beer 'liter' had tapped dry, too- my son had to switch to lemonade. Strange. Are they serving out of 2 liters?? Send someone to the store then! Pizza: My husband and son ordered a huge 18\" mushroom, onion and roasted garlic pizza. It came out Ooey and gooey! Aside from the orange pool of grease, it was a tasty pie. However, for $1.00 per topping, they seemed skimpy here too. You could count the mushroom pieces on the entire pizza on both hands.   My pizza- the vegan 12\"!!! Having had vegan pizza many times in LA, I am spoiled. But I was very surprised, even happy, at my pizza!!!! I got mushrooms and roasted garlic and loved it. They cooked the dough properly and the texture of everything was great!! I'm going to try it next time with their pesto!!   Overall- this was a really fun time. Scored because it was vegan and pet friendly! We will be back often and hope the kinks  get worked out. It has the potential to be a real cool little hang out !"}
{"text":"There are many pizza choices downtown but if you want a huge pizza that tastes like pizza should without Vegas prices than I must recommend RCP. We love the new look and menu. I couldn't believe that you can eat healthy at a pizza joint. I think they also got a new bartender because they make a mean drink with fancy ice! Its amazing that more tourist don't skip the big name restaurants and try more local establishments but that's OK because I don't have to wait for a table then."}
{"text":"Great pizza and even better environment to hang out and have a great time!  I'm a local and I am so happy to know that quality establishments are setting up shop in downtown!"}
{"text":"Came here last Friday and they sat us in the outdoor seating. It was kind of chilly out and heaters would have been nice. My bf and some friends really enjoyed the DJ and the old school hiphop playin.   The pizza was OK first of all, they put diced pepperoni! We couldn't even see it, we all thought they brought us a cheese pizza. Who the heck likes tiny little diced pepperoni? The crust was pretty salty too. Some friends thought it tasted like the frozen tostino's pizza :(   The garlic chicken wings seemed over battered and really greasy. Too greasy for my liking.   The garlic fries were actually really good and crisp, but again, they were extremely greasy."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience here on Friday night! The pizza & salad were delicious, the beer was perfect and service was prompt. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Holy Pizza Freshness! This restaurant is spot on! We had amazing fresh hand made wild mushroom pepporoni sun dried tomatoe pizza with the freshest marinara sauce i have ever tasted in a restaurant! The Caprisse salad had tangerines in it and generous portions of tomatoe and fresh basil, in a delicious balsamic vinaigrette dressing with the creamiest goat cheese that literally blended/melted into the salad! Perfection! The drinks were great, wide choice of specialty drinks and craft beers! The service was impeccable! And the topper of the whole experience,,,,, 5 of us ate till we were full, enjoyed an average of 2 drinks each and took our friend a salad to go.... $72.17 total including a generous tip! Go, eat fresh, enjoy and be happy"}
{"text":"If you're going to get pizza downtown and everywhere is open then either RCP or Pizza Rock will most likely be your top two picks.   RCP is great for their affordable drink prices and single slices. It's not NY pizza (trust me, I'm from NY) but it is still very tasty none the less. Their gluten free pizzas, although on the pricy side, are very good. RCP is also great for their 2 cheese slices & a soda special which will only set you back $5!  Ciroq is the choice of drink for my wife when at RCP and at $5 a pop they're a steal! Think bud light bottles are only $3 but don't quote me.  Great place to have some drinks and watch the game or just kick it with their friendly staff at the bar.  The back patio is a hidden gem and an awesome spot to throw a party. We've hosted BDay parties back there multiple times & always have a blast!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times over the last year since they opened up around February 2013. I return expecting their pizza and the overall experience to be better... but it never is. I've have burnt pizza multiple times. The times it's not burnt it's just bland. They were \"out of beer and wine because of the holidays\" last time I went there, which just goes to show it's poorly managed. Because of the inconvenience of not having beer or wine they gave us ranch \"on the house\". A nice gesture... but do you really need to be charging for a 1 oz cup of ranch? During that same experience my friends and I ordered the fried macaroni balls -- they were still frozen in the middle. Overall it was a pretty bad experience and made me realize that I don't have a desire to give them another chance... especially with places like Pizza Rock, Wild, and Uncle Joe's. Unless RCP can turn itself around I don't expect it to last much longer."}
{"text":"Quality of the food...4 stars. Tastes great with almost perfect crust on both my wife's regular crust and my gluten-free crust pizzas. No complaints about the quality of the food. The service...0 stars. From the to servers standing beside by table trying to decide who was going to take which table that evening while ignoring us to ignoring us for most of the night. Never asked if we wanted refills or another beer. My wife asked about an item on the menu and our server just read back the menu and walked away. If I go back, it'll be for pizza to go."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Their food is expensive and overpriced and they're a bunch of douches. This poor homeless guy walked in while I was waiting for my food and PAID for a couple slices of pizza (as the employees are being rude and giving him side eye the whole time) After PAYING for his pizza, they kick him out and tell him he can't be inside and has to go to the pizza window, where they then ignore him for a while. Once he's sitting outside eating his food, I leave to go buy him a bottle of water. No way in hell I was giving any more money to this place after the way they were treating another human being. I come back with the water bottle just a few doors down to find that they've called downtown security to escort him off the patio- again, the patio where he's eating the pizza he PAID for- crappy, overpriced pizza. I will NEVER eat at this place again."}
{"text":"Great pizza downtown!  Convenient for the bar hoppers! You can drink all night downtown  and walk right up to the window and order pizza by the slice!!! How great is that? ! The one slice I had was off the chain!!! Soooo good,  best pizza in town... From now on when ever I'm downtown I will definitely make time to stop here for more!!! ;p"}
{"text":"I was witness to Karina's table and don't agree with their interpretation. After discussion with the waitress from the night before, I know that they stiffed her the tip for a large bill. They are tacky for even posting. The place is really cool, the food is excellent and the service is even better."}
{"text":"NEWS FLASH: 5 pizza places exist in 3 block radius! More to come in downtown (because why the fuck not?!?!)  This place is no big deal. Unlike most the reviews  I actually didn't have a problem with service , the bar is decent, and the price is avg for the area. But the food just sucked. With Uncle Joe's (a historic family business across the street for $1-$3 less), Boston Pizza,Pop-up pizza at the Plaza,  Luna, and blah blah blah popin' up and taking your drunk money....this place is nothing special."}
{"text":"Finally made it in here for gluten free pizza.  Quite a few vegetarian options as well.  Pizza was good. They could use more alcohol free beverages to offer. But the best thing is they weren't playing hip hop music. I was happy!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at RCP last night and it was wonderful!    I was really surprised with the menu as I figured RCP was just an average pizza place, but I was happy to be wrong. Since there were so many yummy looking selections and we were both very hungry, we ordered a small appetizer buffet and a pizza.  We had the shaved winter vegetable house salad, a beet salad with marscapone, the sashimi topped with orange, EVOO, roe and sea salt, half a dozen oysters w/absinthe, some roasted Brussel sprouts, and the duck pizza and they were all delicious.  The flavors were clean and refined. They even made the Brussel sprouts taste so amazing we ordered a second plate as one was just not enough!  As a person with a laundry list of dietary restrictions I was really impressed with the knowledge the staff had about their menu in order to help me navigate it without feeling like I'm being a pain.  They have GF pizza selections and have several dishes that are or can easily be made vegetarian/vegan.  It made sharing a meal with my restriction free husband simple and pain free which is sometimes not the case.  Perfect dinner for date night!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing! I was to tired to think and just wanted a drink. They hooked it up with a \"girly drink\" for me. It was great. Went back for 2nds later that night."}
{"text":"The positives: The bartender was really friendly and attentive.  Also my two slices came out relatively quickly and my drink was nice and strong.  I think I paid about $13 for two slices and a vodka soda...can't beat that.  The not-so-greats: The pizza here was decent, but nothing to really write  home about.  For some reason the pepperoni was soggy, but the white pizza was good.  I don't think the flavors are really that strong, and it was all really greasy.  It hit my pizza craving, and I couldn't beat the price.  But I wouldn't make a beeline to this place if I visited Vegas again."}
{"text":"This is a new downtown gem. The pizza is amazing, the asparagus appetizer is to die for, and the music is fantastic. They are open super late, so they cater to the night owls. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to check out Radio City Pizza in their new digs down on Fremont with my group the Las Vegas Pizza Posse this evening, and let me just say they really did earn every one of the five stars to be sure. Had a group of twelve and forgot to make our reservation, and seeing as there was an event down on Fremont St. they were already busy, but still managed to get us seated on the patio out back. The pizza was fantastic, not to sure what their secret is with the crust but it was perfect, and the white pie \"deliciousness\". The service was first rate, and even though seated on the patio, I can say not one thing was overlooked or neglected. They definitely made us feel welcome. One recommendation, if you're thinking about checking this place out with a group of say more than four, be sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"I love that this place has gluten free pizza- when I went to pick up my order I also saw that they have GF beer too. I was visiting my sister in Vegas and everyone wanted pizza but since im GF we had to find a place for me too. We ordered 2 small pizzas- 1 plain, 1 veggie with pepperoni added. We also got a GF pizza with black olives, onions, pepperoni, green peppers as well as an order of wings and a garden salad. When we got there- the owner greeted us and was VERY friendly. Service was amazing which I always appreciate. However, the food totaled to $70!!!! SEVENTY DOLLARS!!!! well I thought, lets just see how good this pizza is. We got back and opened everything up. The wings literally looked like something that was previously frozen- they were also very small and the sauce was lackluster. They tasted ok- but for $8 I would expect a little more. The salad was fine- totally what I would expect for a small $5 salad. The 2 small pizzas were a hit- everyone really liked them. The sauce was very flavorful.  The gluten free pizza- thats where it goes awry. The actual crust was GREAT- however, it looked like the pizza was cooked JUST to the cheese started to melt. It was terribly under done. The onions were just about 2 spoonfuls of diced white onions, the green peppers were very lacking as well. I would like to give this place a 4 or 5 star review but for $70 that pizza just was not good enough."}
{"text":"This whole place has just recently been redone, starting with the menu, and the restaurant itself! It is small, cozy and has a nice modern vibe to it.  The beers on tap are very original and not necessarily something you can find just anywhere (highly recommended!) The appetizers themselves are just fantastic, as I personally have not had better oysters at most oyster bars, and the chicken wings are off the hook.  They got traditional styled pizza as well as some toppings you would never expect on a pizza but go surprisingly well!  The staff treats you right and does a great job starting from the cooks in the back to every one in the front.  Will be returning many times to finish tasting everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"my girlfriend and i have become regulars here, coming about 3 times a month. servers always recognize us, even remember our order! for an establishment downtown that sees so many people this is amazing to me.   the pizza is always great and i'd kill someones mom for the alfredo fries. highly recommend"}
{"text":"Food 3/5 Had the Rosemary garlic fries, I'm a lover of fries especially and love Rosemary and garlic but Rosemary simply doesn't go well in this combo  Slice of pepperoni, personally I like metro pizza better but my friends said they liked this place better  Beverages 4/5 Craft beer choices were great for Vegas! I had an ipa, can't remember which one though  Service 4/5 Was constantly asked if I needed anything and the servers were very attentive  Tips Get a slice of pizza at the front and then go straight to the bar. I saw long waits for pizza if you sit down. Why wait when you can have a beer, relax, and enjoy that pizza with style!"}
{"text":"Good pizza and they have a full bar. You can order by the slice or a whole pie. Not a great beer selection but gets the job done. It's not a big place so it gets a little crowded when they get busy. Great place to watch sports since they have tons of TVs for such a small space."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, and it's a very chill atmosphere. Quick service and the bartenders were very friendly. I strongly suggest giving it a try if in the Downtown area. They have shots of Fireball, Jamison, and Ciroc for only 5$."}
{"text":"Pizza was not that good. Beer selection was weak at best. The vibe of the place was really bad compared to what it was just after being outside. Waitress even seemed depressed. Wont eat here again and definitely wouldn't go out of ny way to eat here...Good concept gone bad and poorly executed."}
{"text":"A true gem this place. It is without a doubt ***THE BEST PIZZA in Las Vegas*** everyone knows that NY has the best pizza and RCP's homemade pizza it's just like it. Thin-crusted-deliciousness-all-over-your-face-cheesy-goodness, I call it pizza heaven... Try the White Pizza, it's my favorite :)  I've been going to RCP since it was located in Summerlin because it was close to home, it took only one visit for me to become a fan and go back often- I mean what kind of girl doesn't like watching the game while drinking $1 beers right? Done & done. They have great deals, a great atmosphere, good prices and amazing food. I highly recommend it, plus it's right in the heart of downtown and they're open late- perfect place to end (or begin) the night. It's my to-go pizza place for sure."}
{"text":"The bbq chicken pizza was amazing. This is the only place in vegas i have seen sierra nevada torpedo on tap and it was only 5 bucks! The menu changes daily as well, which is dope!"}
{"text":"Visited here for the UFC fights on November 16, price was good, ten dollars for cover (expected) both waitress were super friendly, Victoria was one she was great!! So friendly, very attentive, was asking if we needed refills before we fully ran out, made great recommendations and had great knowledge of the beers, their taste, where they were from etc, the other waitress was also good, didn't know her name, but she was a floor waitress, when it was slower and she had more time again super friendly and smiley   Then the worst happened. They had a shift change. The two new waitress were NOT friendly, not smiley, not attentive, one of the girls was even cussing to the other waitress talking about the previous servers and basically DRAMA, now it was loud, she probably didn't think I could hear her, but not only did I hear her I knew what and who she was talking about. Not very professional at all.    I would probably come back here again, but I would check who was working first.   I tried the garlic rolls, they weren't anything I will crave again, but they weren't bad either. I saw a few pizzas come out that looked delicious though."}
{"text":"Went in with my parents for a \"quick\" slice of pizza to tie us over until dinner. Guy behind the counter said it would be right up. After 5 minutes or so I asked the lady up front how much longer. Since there was nowhere to sit we sat outside in the cold. She said she would bring it out to us. So a moment later she comes out and tells us there are no more slices and it will be like 8 minutes longer.  Why didn't the guy tell us that in the first place?  By now we move inside into the loud, cramped dining room. Pizza arrives and I ask for silverware. Silverware is filthy with water stains.  Worst part was the pizza. Terrible. Too much stringy cheese, dough without flavor, sauce watery crap.  I can't believe they call this ny pizza.  Please...save yourself the money and the time and stay away from this poor excuse for a pizza joint."}
{"text":"So there was this pizza joint in Tivoli Village once upon a time...they didn't put out a quality product in a location where that mattered...oh, guess what they're back with that same level of quality...only this time they just might survive off the tourists and bar hoppers.  I was in the neighborhood and needed some food.  My friends and I saw that something new was open next to Insert Coins.  We thought we'd check it out.  I wish we hadn't.  The pizza is just okay and the service had many issues...left hand never seemed to figure out what the right hand was doing the whole time we were there.  If the the end product was great I'd give them another shot to improve the service, after all, they haven't been open all that long.  As it is I have no reason to stop back in here.  I'd rather drive a few mins or walk a little farther for something I want.  If you find yourself here however (and you are set on staying) it seems like BBQ Pizza or Parm Fries might be the way yo go."}
{"text":"Visited last week with a group of friends in town for March Madness. Great Pizza joint!! We were thrilled with all the TV's so we didn't miss a beat with any of the games.   We had wings, garlic knots & the Viva Las Vegas pizza. Can't remember exactly what was on it, but the pie was the bomb!' Friendly service, cheap beer and the back patio space is very cool. The weather was great that night, so it was a perfect set-up.   Positive recommend for sure. Downtown needed this badly"}
{"text":"To be completely fair, my judgement of Radio City Pizza came at almost 2am, just before they close, and I had openly participated in the \"all you can drink\" game for about 3 hours prior to eating here....Now that said, I thought it was awesome.  You couldn't beat the 2 slices of cheese pizza and a coke for $5 deal at this time of the night/morning. Pizza is exactly what I wanted and needed and Radio City Pizza delivered, pun totally intended. The slices were big, pizza was thin, which I love. Great flavor, greasy but not to the point of where it was dripping all over the place. Cool thing was that there was 4 of us eating and they delivered an entire pizza plus 2 pieces. Considering it was almost 2am the service was great, our waitress was really nice. Not super attentive, but I wouldn't expect too much at that time of the night/morning. Great decor, a sports lovers paradise with a ton of TV's. Seems like it would be a great place to watch a few games on a Sunday.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm downtown."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill. Used to be my favorite place on Fremont... Now they have a confused identity and have slashed wait staff. They have turned it into a wanna be sports bar. They also claimed to have one dollar bud lights all NFL season long. Suddenly that signed disappeared and now budlights are 4$ a pop. Figure out your identity and stop changing prices, menu, and staff every two weeks.  You have decent food but extremely confused management. People do not come to Fremont for a sportsbar."}
{"text":"So this place is fantastic! Went in there with my boyfriend and his friend to grab a slice before a show. First I wanna say I love the vibe, it's clean and dimly lit but with this hip kinda feel. Came in and the server was super friendly gave us a lot of info on the menu. The place has different kind of beers from different places, the server knew a lot about each beer so he was able to help us all pick out something different for us to try. Then the pizza, you can have a whole pizza or just some slices for a great price. I had the green ,which comes with the daily green veggie for the day, and the white, which is a cheese pizza but with a variety of cheeses. The pizzas came out in a timely manner and man were they fantastic. I'd for sure come back again."}
{"text":"My office just moved into Tivoli Village this weekend so I've eaten at this place 3 times in the last week. Each time the food had been great and my husband loved the cheap beer on tap after a long day of moving.   We've had the chicken club pizza a couple times and it is just awesome, the toppings were fresh and plentiful and the pizza was cooked perfectly.   We also tried the white pizza when we order for the office and it was good but I think it could have used more garlic (but I love garlic so it may just be me).   We also shared an order of chicken fingers and an order of the garlic parmesean chips one day for lunch. The fingers are really good, crunchy on the outside but moist and tender on the inside with a nice flavor to the breading and the honey mustard dipping sauce was really good. The garlic chips were sooooo good. A little greasy but since they are freshly fried I expected that but the flavor and the texture of the chips was just wonderful.  The prices were good for the amount of food, each time that hubby and I shared we were both full and the total with tip was under $25.  Now that I work in Tivoli I think this will be a common lunch stop for me."}
{"text":"We visited RCP after we completed the Color Run. We were starving, and a group of 5 of us showed up before actual business hours. The server wasn't too thrilled to have us trekking in the mounds of colored corn starch all over her not-even-open restaurant, but she warmed up after an initial 'don't sit anywhere, no tables are set up' freak out. (I don't blame her. Our rainbow colored gang was hungry, shedding mess all over the place, and using her bathroom as a mini shower).   My sister and I split a gluten free pizza crust. The pie was delicious. The mixed drinks were good and reasonably priced, given its prime Fremont location.   RCP, thanks for providing service and sustenance even before your actual business hours."}
{"text":"Nothing to complain. Nothing to defend. The food was delicious. We had sandwiches not pizza but the pizza that came out looked amazing. And the fries were on point, very affordable, delicious beer choices, timely service. The owner used to be a Rockette, hence the name Radio City Pizza. She personally greeted us and checked on us throughout the meal. I'll be back many many times."}
{"text":"At first look this seems like a great fun place. And it might be if you just dine there. HOWEVER if you decide to partner up with them for any type of events just know that you will be entirely on your own for promotions etc....  The food was okay but the service was slow. After our event which by the way no management came out to say is everything okay or is there anything you need....we decided to order. Had to flag down the waiter. They brought over one menu for a table of five, then had to ask for water. After ordering it took approx 25 minutes for our food to arrive. Then it was brought out without utensils or napkins. Might as well have been a self serve. Plus one of the items that we ordered never arrived! Had to also go inside and request check. I had a friend who sat inside and they said the service was not much better.  Will I ever be back...no!  The only plus for this business is that you can bring your dog!"}
{"text":"We had alittle of everything. This place is dope...good drinks and good food. Service= friendly, professional. The place is clean. My husband is talking about having a birthday celebration since the environment is hip and refreshing."}
{"text":"After a recent menu overhaul, RCP has become a hidden gem downtown and a hotspot for fresh, seasonal food. Standard pizzas and italian fare have been replaced with inventive items that will impress even the most adventurous of eaters such as: beef heart tartare, chicken and oyster pizza, crudo, winter squash pizza, roasted shishito peppers, spinach salad with gorgonzola, kushi oysters,  brussel sprouts...I could go on!!   The tartare is amazing, mixed with capers, an aioli, and egg yolk, serve with toasted baguette. The pizza crust is the perfect combination of crispy and chewy, topped with roasted and pickled squash, all warm and creamy! The BEST part however, is the insaneeeee beer available here! I always find something new and surprising that I've never had before. Chef Sean, previously of Rose.Rabbit.Lie is about to unveil some new homemade pastas as well I hear.....YUM."}
{"text":"We ordered antipasto without the meat for our starter/salad and a 12 inch pizza with olives and mushrooms, and asked for it well done.  They brought the antipasto with the pizza, and they offered to reheat the pizza, we said we do not want reheated pizza, so to just take away the antipasto.  The pizza was not well done, in fact it was undercooked, the dough was doughy and the cheese wasn't all the way melted.  The sauce tasted like it was plain tomato sauce out of the can with a bunch of salt added.  Definitely not a return place."}
{"text":"Chatted with the manager and our awesome server Melissa, down to earth! The pizza is always good the beer is cheap. Everyone is just down to earth friendly. Def. a new favorite spot for at least a weekly visit. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Nice hidden gem! Pizza was just as excellent as service and I loved the vibe / overall feel of the restaurant with some classic hip-hop playing at a perfect volume.  If you're downtown on Fremont Street and hungry make that extra walk."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to this place in the last few months, give it another try. RCP used to be a \"only go if you're drunk and won't notice the crappy, crappy food\" kind of place. Now they have new everything, and it's a whole different place. Great pizzas, craft beers, a ridiculously glorious wine list that makes me happy in my face. To top it off, they now have delicious, interesting options you won't find anywhere else (Beef Heart Tartare, anyone?) and isn't crazily overpriced, like a lot of places downtown. It's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Service out of this world in nice! I love this place the best pizza I've had since moving from NY to Vegas. It's kind of placed in a little bit of a inconvenient area but I loved this place I can't wait t go back.  They're pizza is absolutely phenomenal I cannot say it any better than that. They also make a really good home style ranch. This is a must visit, must try pizza shop if your in vegas."}
{"text":"It's okay, not my favorite. It's just really greasy but maybe that is what it is supposed to be like. I had the green slice and it didn't have much flavor. Maybe I just don't like pizza. Lol no hard feelings rcp  it's not you it might be me."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for Radio City Pizza to open downtown cause I work in the area. I'm so happy that it finally open the location is a in a great spot. I have already been there twice in 1 week. The bartender on St. Patricks day was awesome made this great shot. I went for lunch today and the service was great and my waitress had a awesome personalilty. If you love pizza you should try this place out, I will definatly be going back. Even around lunch time the place was packed and we got our food in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Chose Radio City Pizza during the first \"Wednesdays Downtown\" event as neither me or my bud had been and our first choice Le Thai had a 45 min wait (RCP was pretty much the only restaurant that seemed dead - unfortunately we soon found out why). The menu wasn't all that impressive (but I can be a picky eater), so I opted for the Salmon Sandwich. At $12 it wasn't as crazy over-priced as some of the menu was and while it wasn't anything special (salmon, mixed greens, and Thousand Island on a bun), at least quality/freshness of the fish made it seem worthwhile (unfortunately the fries that came on side were definitely not - they seemed to be \"twice-fried\", sub-fast food quality - and for no obvious reason were served with a side marinara sauce & not ketchup...huh?). All of this wouldn't have been that offensive except the rest of the dining experience was rather uninviting: they were woefully understaffed even though they weren't very busy - the lone waitress was nice but beyond frazzled (we had to ask for utensils, which were pre-packaged plastic; then we never even got the napkins we asked for, having to grab them from the counter when we spotted some); the beers were all crazy ridiculously expensive (most of them were $10), so we opted to stick with water; and of course there were the obligatory amount of flat screens showing new/sports/etc and one was blaring so insanely loud that we couldn't hear each other and have a normal conversation (and neither could the waitress). Sad as I know this place has been open awhile and I like to support local joints, but hey - there's a better pizza place just across the street...too bad they don't see the need to step up their game and actually be competitive, cuz neither one of us will be back."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, drinks alright, but service was extremely lacking. It felt like we were a bother to the wait staff. I don't think I would return here."}
{"text":"WHY DON'T THEY READ THESE REVIEWS! IF MANAGEMENT KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING THEY WOULNT HAVE THE MOST HORRIBLE PIZZA, STAFF, MANAGEMENT ETC. If any smart owner would read this he would read this to his staff and fire the chef and start getting that place in better shape. Honestly this place sucked at Tivoli and it sucks at Fremont. Close this place and let a real pizza joint get it right! By the way the health dept really needs to make a visit....disgusting!"}
{"text":"\"If you're gonna spend on some pizza, you may as well do it well and this is one of the places to do it at!\" Brick-Oven pizza made to order......just the way pizza should be! \"Oh.....and come with an appetite and good company!\" :-)"}
{"text":"Went to check out the Containers centre downtown. They only been open few months so not a lot of options for food. Decided to walk towards Fremont experience. Where I came across Radio City pizza. Was greeted right away. Loved the atmosphere. It had a full bar and a lot of TVs. Service was great and food was awesome. I had salmon salad. Salmon was seasoned perfect and moist. My boyfriend ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza. Tasted fresh and was very hot. The sliders were yummy. Was on a sweet roll for bun, chipotle mayo, think was Swiss cheese. Meat was juicy. Normally not a fan of sliders but had good flavor combos. When we left we were greater by the owner. Very friendly and gave us the scoop about the history. Very interesting... You could tell she cares about her customers. She took the time to talk to us. And caters to her customers. I'm a local and will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This location is closed.  The website says they will re-open in a week or so on Fremont Street in downtown LV.  Decent pizza and cheep beer.  Hope it stays that way when they open downtown"}
{"text":"LOVE RCP. I stop by here every time I am downtown. Their $5 pizza deal is perfect for lunch, and the food is delicious. I love the atmosphere, and the service is amazing. I highly recommend Radio City Pizza for a slice and drink next time you are Downtown!"}
{"text":"My request was simple - a slice of NYC in LV.   Radio City granted that request, as well as provided good service on a busy Friday night.  I'm happy. I'll be back. End of story.  1st real slice of pizza since I left Queens = #5-Stah-Fo-U!"}
{"text":"Out of business as of my last visit to Tivoli Village on  September 29th....tough place to stay open as TV is a ghost town most of the time, too bad as it is a really nice place..."}
{"text":"I thought the Vegas Pizza was very tasty and unique!  Service was friendly and fast. Greeted promptly. Enjoyed the hockey game on the TV. $.50 PBRs are a STEAL! This is a good local pizzeria. I wouldn't say it's spectacular but I enjoyed it. Also liked the outdoor seating, for pet owners this would be a place to bring them.  Did I mention they can deliver??? What? Awesome! I would recommend the cannolis they were my favorite. So very good!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have to update my review so soon, but wow, this place has gone downhill FAST.  My husband picked up a few slices for dinner tonight and learned that the specialty slices (like the chicken pesto pizza I enjoyed so much last week) are no longer available- you can only get them as a full pie. We didn't want to wait so instead, I had two slices of cheese that were almost inedibly salty, with a tough, chewy crust.  We got the parmesan garlic chips again and they were absolutely horrible. It was seriously like eating crunchy pieces of deep-fried paper. They are no longer thick-cut and crispy-chewy... they are sliced paper-thin, so thin that they are transparent (not translucent, absolutely transparent). They taste like nothing. I see some cheese and herbs sprinkled in the bag but the chips retain no flavor whatsoever. It's a serious disappointment.  I don't know if this is just a fluke or if things will be like this from now on but next time I want pizza downtown, I will go elsewhere (maybe Pop-Up Pizza at the Plaza). Sigh. Another downtown disappointment."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good but nothing too special. For a place right on Fremont St I was surprised that it was so cheap though. Fairly extensive selection of draft beer for a pizza joint too. And what!? Brooklyn Beer in Las Vegas? Nice touch RCP.  I will say, I witnessed an order of macaroni and bacon balls or something of the sort. That sounds too good to be legal, so I may have to be back to try that and perhaps adjust my rating accordingly."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, service sucked ass. I believe our servers name was Katherine, or some shit like that. She didn't greet us nor introduced herself, she also didn't offer us any drinks or asked what we wanted to drink till later, & NO IT WASNT BUSY. We still had pizza at our table, and just cause my friend's plate was empty, she took it assuming he was done. She didn't even ask him if he was done with his plate. ..my friend paid & swear he was close to leaving her no tip. On the way out, my friend asked this man who served us water if he was a manager or something, & he said he was one of the owners, my friend literally told him that she sucked."}
{"text":"I came here after the 89XXX elite event and wanted to grab a quick bite. I've passed by this place quite a few times and never stopped in. So, since I was here, and a touch hungry, I decided to grab a slice.  UGH! Lousy pizza, but quick service. I wont be back. Needs to be a much better tasting pizza for $4! Sauce was weirdly \"tangy\". Crust was eh. Definitely had better!"}
{"text":"Pretty yummy pizza and the price was awesome! I just walked by this place and seen the prices I paid about $4 for a slice of pizza and it was bomb! I'm so coming back to this place next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Stopped in during Vegas StrEATs since the food trucks that were there didn't interest me. Sat at the bar and we were told about he $2 draft specials. I had a beer and noticed one other end of the bar the had Magic Hat #9. One of my favorite beers when living on he east coast. It is a Vermont beer, try it! The pizza was pretty damn good. I ordered a slice with meatball. It took 15-20 mins for a slice but worth the wait. Bartenders were friendly and quick with the drafts. I will be back to try more of their tempting menu items."}
{"text":"Smells good, taste great, and its served up lickity split from a little window right on Fremont."}
{"text":"This place is just not very good.  While visiting downtown, we decided to try this place and ordered three different pizzas.  The first was a traditional cheese pizza, which was below average.  The sauce had an odd taste that was not pleasing, the cheese seemed average.  The second pizza was a meat lovers version, which obviously had the same sauce problem.  However the meats on the pie were good and I remember them being plentiful.  The third pizza was a buffalo chicken pizza and as such it did not have the house pizza sauce, which made it the best pie we ordered.  To be fair, I have to point out that the pizza dough was good and the crunch / char from the pizza oven was nice.  In the end I really dislike their sauce and hence makes their pizzas off putting for me.  With a place like Pizza Rock just down the street there is no point to waste time and money here."}
{"text":"we started from no clean tables available, the only one clean had no chairs, the cashier was so distracted, we payed him $7 for the special (2 pizza slices & beer) with a $20 bill he gave me back $8, when i asked him what was this he didn't even know what was that change from, after reminding him he asked me how much is 20 minus 7, i said 13, then he grabs a pack of bills from his pocket and gives me the correct change. i was never explained that the special came with only cheese pizza, i asked to have pepperoni, he mentioned if i pay $1 he will change it for me, after getting my slices one is pepperoni the other one is cheese... after paying $1 I asked him what happened and he goes \"ill give you your $1 back and keep the slices\" the worst place in downtown... the pizza was ok, i wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Exceptional, new, reasonably priced wine list. Love the new art and interior design too. Highly recommend giving this place a try again if you haven't been in a while."}
{"text":"Great east coast style pizza sandwiches are awesome, service is satisfactory. Only 2 things i dislike, small interior and no restrooms for guest."}
{"text":"The restaurant in Tivoli Village is Very Wheelchair friendly ...appreciated that espescially...   The food was excellent.... I ordered the meatball sandwich... it came with fries ... was very well made. My sister ordered the salad and it was the same price as the sandwich ( 8.00 ) but compared to the sandwich she didnt receive as big a portion as she would have liked.... The salad was pricey compared to the sandwich. My parents ordered the Pizza .... nothing but love for the pizza!!   The staff was exceptional !! Greeted very friendly by the door person and our waitress made sure we were full up on drinks and everything met our satisfaction..... The Manager made it a point to see that we were well too!! I had visited the restaurant before taking my family there and I was well greeted by one of the waitors and Management.... Thank You!! Made me feel like royalty and at home ..... I will be sure to visit this place often .  Despite a skimpy salad I give this place 5 outta 5 stars...."}
{"text":"From the other reviews, I was expecting slow service and good food. We got great service and great food. Maybe they've heard the complaints about service and addressed the issue but either way, we had a good experience here.   We were waited on immediately, drinks were out in a flash (yes the $2 pitchers of PBR do exist here and attract the associated hipsters) actually the beer was really good and cold, and the pizza, we had the pesto chicken pizza and it was dy-no-mite! Light chewy crust was the key here. No red sauce on this pie (yes I called it a pie) and with me, aside from the crust, the sauce is boss so I'll need to try a traditional pizza here to test that.  Overall good stuff here. Tivoli is coming around finally with more and more places to eat and drink so it's not so ghost town-ish anymore."}
{"text":"Giving three stars strictly on the service which was excellent.  I wish I could say the same for the food.  We ordered garlic knots for an app. and half came out fine the other half (the larger knots)where raw inside.  Showed the server and she said she would bring us some new ones. I said no thanks, but she brought them out anyways.  I would have preferred them just taken off the bill, but at least she did something to make it right.  Next was the meat pizza.  Crust was very chewy and the sauce was very sweet.  Not sure what was salty, but the combination didn't sit right with me.  Might give it another shot."}
{"text":"This place had so much potential. They are set up right next to the new Park on Fremont, they have small outside patio for those who love to eat outside like I do, but that's about all they have going for them. I'm still not a downtown lover even with all the new renovations they've had over the years, I keep giving it more tries, yet I am still not falling in love like everyone else. We were going to a 51's game, and my company happened to be a couple with a 3 y/o, so we needed something kid friendly, decided pizza would be best. Seems like we had the opposite of everyone else's experience; good service but terrible pizza.   We started out with;   Medium wings, great flavor, but both the ranch and blue cheese were so watered down it was impossible to keep it on the wing, we even tried pouring it over the wing and it would just run off.   Hawaiian pizza. Again, it had potential. Huge pieces of jalapeños, red onion, pineapple, cilantro, and ham. The pizza was so disappointing. It was soggy, you couldn't pick it up to eat because the toppings slid off, the crust was like mush. I ended up eating it with a fork and knife. Oh, and they serve Pepsi products. Another let down (bad ranch, soggy pizza and Pepsi make for a really bad pizza experience)."}
{"text":"We were so excited for this place. As downtown residents, we definitely wanted to come here all the time. Unfortunately, the pizza was just bad. The wings also tasted like weird chicken nuggets. If you need a pizza place downtown, Uncle Joe's across the street and Pop Up Pizza in the plaza are way better and way cheaper."}
{"text":"Very disappointed after driving all the way across town and walking six blocks to try their happy hour only to be informed they are not seating any more people as they had a private event soon. ..on a Tuesday no less.  Meanwhile they still had the sign advertising happy hour out on the sidewalk."}
{"text":"I must say this is a much needed restaurant on the west side of town! They offer the best gluten-free pizza I have had which is such a delight since it's so hard to find decent tasting gluten-free food. It has a fun a nd friendly atmosphere with a great staff. Their salad is also great, not  your typical boring lettuce salad you find at most pizza places. Can't wait for them to start serving beer and alcohol - it will definitely be my new local spot!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch twice now. Service for two or three was super quick and we got out food really fast. I like their pizza a lot and I love the location"}
{"text":"I love The Goodwich, so when I saw that Radio City was associated with the same owners (...not sure the exact relationship....), I moved it to the top of my bookmarks. We had the kids in tow, so we sat outside on the patio and opted for a traditional and a gourmet pie. Overall, I just plain didn't like the pizza. The traditional pepperoni/mushroom was super greasy, and I even like greasy pizza! For the specialty, we went with the pork pie or whatever the pork one is called, off the waitress' recommendation. I either didn't read the description closely or the ingredients were too gourmet for me to even know what they were. It came with a chorizo-y type of sausage on top, which I wasn't quite expecting, and which led to some serious grease.  Service was friendly enough, but the patio is basically nonfunctional. The 3 tables were all super wobbly - like the bottoms and tops were both off kilter. Each table is so tiny, it can barely fit 2 plates and drinks, with the pizza up on one of their little stand thingys. While we were outside a gust of wind that was not even that strong knocked our pizza stand thing right over and the entire pizza fell on the ground! When the waitress came back out, we let her know what happened. She was super apologetic and got us some slices to replace what we lost, but by that time we didn't even want it anymore. On the plus side, it's a legit beer bar, and I would go back strictly for that. A new bar opened up on their back patio, which I really want to visit, but they don't open til 8, and we were eating early that night. Next time."}
{"text":"There's been a sudden flood of pizzerias and East Coast-themed Italian eateries opening in Las Vegas, all which make that search for a quality pizza not as difficult and daunting a task it used to be. But if you want to know the place that's going serve as the ruler for the burgeoning Las Vegas-pizzeria marketplace to measure itself against, then Radio City Pizzeria is serving up what you're looking for.   Growing up in Jersey, I was surrounded by pizzerias catering up delicious and decisively perfect thin slices of tomato-sauce laden, cheese-stretching slices of pizza. Unfortunately, I was never aware of how lucky I was to grow up in such a delectable environment, and ever since moving away for college in the early '90s, I've found myself rating pizzas with such characteristic phrases as \"close enough\" or \"in-a-pinch, this'll suffice\"; every slice always falling short of the pizza I grew up with.   So, in the winter of 2012, amid reviews of Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan and a rash of newly opened pizzerias in Summerlin, I found myself quite skeptical of yet one more place heralding itself as authentic-East Coast/NY-style/Italian-recipe pizzeria. Lucky for Radio City (or really, for me), my son attends classes at Kidville in Tivoli Village, which happens to sit right across from Radio City, and the fates dealt me the perfect opportunity to try this pizza joint out.  I met my husband and son on a Tuesday evening after my son's Kidville class. My husband was immediately won over by the giant Pabst Blue Ribbon neon sign and stated unequivocally that, \"This is where we'll be eatin' tonight!\"   Now, before you beer snobs start furrowing your brows and turning up your noses, this ain't a brewery. This is a pizzeria. And if you got a problem with a good ole family-run joint serving something that's been a quality American-made beer that raised a generation of blue-collar workers on the perfect blend of hops and barley, well, you can take your Ed Hardy-wearing, chrome-tipped tailpipe, never-got-your-hands dirty self and get another mani/pedi instead of readin' any more of this. Pabst Blue Ribbon is a beer's beer, and you might do yourself well to kick off the airs and enjoy one. Radio City serves up drafts for $0.50, and when you're working to get from one paycheck to the next, that's certainly in the budget.    But I digress...  We ordered a 12-inch pepperoni along with a Pabst for my husband, a glass of House Red for myself and an apple juice for the boy. Everything felt as it should. Basketball was on the TV, our waitress (Mimi) brought the drinks, and soon the pizza arrived.   There it sat, on a steel pan, oozing delicious red oil. My heart immediately jumped. It looked authentic -- would it taste that way? As I picked up the first slice, pulling off stretchy, stringy strands of cheese that clung stubbornly to the tray, my instinct-driven index finger immediately bent the crust in half and soon the folded slice met my mouth for the first bite.   I was at once transported back to Little It(aly)'s Pizza in my high school hometown. The mozzarella was melted to a perfect cheesy consistency. The sauce was a delectable blend of acidity and sweetness.The crust was crisp yet soft. My mind rode the pure bite of pizza goodness through decades of desire back to those moments of wondrous New Jersey/New York pizza perfection I enjoyed during my youth.  Alliteration and prose aside, Radio City Pizzeria is it. Buy it by the slice, buy it by the pie, you won't be disappointed. Pull up a stool, pull up a chair, pull up a cold draft Pabst and enjoy pizza the way it should be. We'll be there every Tuesday night, having a slice of pizza as a family over a couple of Pabst Blues, House Reds and apple juices. Come say hi to the Swishers and enjoy a piece of pizza perfection at Radio City Pizzeria."}
{"text":"Recently started coming here and really enjoy it. Very affordable and the pizza is great. Can't beat the .50 PBR and must have the Garlic Chips."}
{"text":"We had no complaints about the garlic knots and the Viva Vegas pizza. The knots were fresh and nicely garlicky. The pizza was A-OK. I am a fan of a thin crispy crust. Service was not the best - quite inattentive, and the place was not even half full on a Saturday at lunchtime. If we didn't want to have lots of time to talk and not eat, it would have been a very negative experience. I would probably go back if the Leone Cafe was too busy."}
{"text":"I like the pizza here, granted they were closing at 10p on a Thur night and were only serving slices.  I thought the pizza went well after a few drinks around downtown.  I ordered a slice of mushroom and managed to finish that and order another slice before the kitchen officially closed.  I ordered another mushroom, this time you can tell they kinda half assed it by making a cheese pizza and putting mushrooms on top of it after it was cooked.  Either way, after a good buzz I couldn't tell the difference.  I wouldn't mind trying this place again sober!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, amazing beer selection, and very reasonable prices. A great find and highly recommend when visiting Freemont Street (just at end across from Heart Attack Grill)"}
{"text":"They've really gone downhill at their new location. More money for less quality. I've been to their downtown location twice, I wont make a mistake by trying it a 3rd time.  This past time, we ordered chicken fingers with garlic parm fries, we received burnt chicken pieces with sweet potato fries. The server wasn't aware they were out of normal fries. She ended up comping the chicken fingers.  Pizza was greasy and lacked flavor.   Upside is they have a better selection of beers than even when they first opened up shop downtown. But other places have good beer too, ill go there.  Two stars because at least our waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"This place has gluten free pizza and uses daiya cheese.  So that's a plus in my book for bringing or telling my friends who live in the area.  I unforgivably, do not live in the area but, was there by happenstance so, I stopped by to try some of this NYC style pizza.   BTW, I was born and raised in NYC so, that's a challenge to my ears when a restaurant claims to have NYC pizza.  First we had to find Tivoli village, park, and totally feel awkward as us Henderson people don't really fancy shamncy dress up and this place looks like the toilets are lined with gold and beautiful women shit rose petals out of their asses.  We get to the pizza place and it's nice and looks like every other restaurant that's going for the metal on wood urban theme.  I ordered the vegas pizza and sat down to wait.  I should have gotten a slice of pizza because the wait was killing me.  the pizza crust aspires to have that NYC crisp on the outside and chewy wet on the inside mouth feel.  The dough is flavorful but, when I went it was a bit too salty.  The toppings were good quality and the cheese was chewy, stringy, and all the things I look for.  It really does come close and they have a great product.  I give them fist pump for that.  Is it NYC pizza? No. But, it's def NYC style so, def give them some support instead of ordering from nasty papa john's.  *Beware, they put peppercinis on the vegas pizza. I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.  just ruined the whole pizza.  tasted like sour chunks.*"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this place out after a show right across the street.  We walked in about a quarter to 2am or so.  We asked if they were still open and if they still had pizza by the slice.  They said yes and we walked up to the counter.  The younger girl at the register was absolutely rude.  She was on her phone and also cursed the entire time we stood there waiting for our pizza. She was completely unprofessional.  We finally got our pizza.  My friend finished hers pretty quickly.  I had about a quarter left of mine.  This is when they started to turn out lights.  Which was fine when they turned down the main light.  But then everyone, the two 'servers' and the cooks started waiting by the door and continued to turn off all the rest of the lights even though they still had dirty tables to clean.  There wasn't a trash can or napkins to be found.  We finally got fed up with their obvious kicking us out. We walked out, me with pizza in hand, at 2:08am.  If this is the norm of service, I won't be back.  The pizza is ok but there's definitely other pizza joints on Fremont with much better service and much better pizza.  The beer was also overpriced."}
{"text":"This review covers both of my visits.  The first visit was on a weekend night and it was pretty busy, but it is a small place.  The service was not good, to be gentle.  I shouldn't have to get out of my seat to find someone to take my order.  Then, at the end of the meal, have to go find someone to bring the bill.  The service sucked, but the pizza was pretty good.  The best part though was the beer.  It is cheap!!  Not a happy hour, it is cheap all the time.  I would have given this visit 3 stars, but cheap beer is worth an extra star.    My second visit was around 3pm on a weekday.  There was no other customers in the whole place.  This time, the server was all over us; so much that it was a bit creepy.  This time, we ordered pizza by the slice.  It came out burnt on the top.  After delivering it, he left and only a minute later came back to check on us.  After telling him that we were ok, he asked if the pizza was overdone.  We told him that it was burnt, which he obviously knew.  Here is a bit of advice...if you are a server and you see that food you are delivering is burnt, use some common sense and have it redone.  Step up and have some quality control.  Good thing you have cheap beer."}
{"text":"Very good service. Food was awesome!  Timely and friendly!  Owner is a former rockette checked on us during our meal gave us some history about her spot...def a must in downtown vegas!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a party of 16 on a very busy Friday night. I must say i am a fan. The only reason i wont give 5 stars is because we had a res and our table wasn't ready at the time. I understand that its a small place so it wasn't a big deal especially because one of the employees brought us beer and wine while we waited. The food was GREAT as well as the service. We had 3 different pizzas (incl 1 gluten free), Chicken marsala, Caesar salads, Caprese, Antipasto and cannoli's for dessert. This was all washed down with the incredible .50 PBR's. Great little place!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time here. The staff was super friendly. Best service I've had my whole vacation! Are waitress was so incredible sweet (Mimi), very attentive & cheered up me & my partner after a bit of an upsetting event at another place. I would come back just for the great service alone.     I had the veggie pizza on gluten free crust without cheese. One of my favourite things about this place was they don't charge to swap out toppings. I have a very restricting diet so this was great for me. They added extra sauce & jalapeño & roasted garlic for no extra charge! The pizza was delicious! The sauce on it was amazing! Everything was cooked perfectly, the toppings were fresh. The pizza was a good size. My very hungry partner & I split this pizza. It was a good portion for the two of us! This pizza was $21. Normally I would think this was a little bit of a steep price but the quality of the pizza made it 100% worth it.   The atmosphere was nice, they played kinda top 40 music, had oodles of T.Vs with sports one. It was very clean & organized. I liked it.   I would say if you're in the area or feel like some really yummy pizza to check this place out. I hope I have time on this trip to go back!"}
{"text":"Do you like it hard and thick?  Your pizza crust I mean : )  So we went here a few nights ago because we LOVE pizza and this place was super close to our apartment. We also go to Tivoli Village like 4 days a week :)  We cam here around 730pm so it was pretty dead; which was good!! We opted to seat outside since it was a nice night and my son like to run around. I took a look at the menu and we were trying to figure out if we should order the 2 slice plus a soda for 7$ or the 10\" pizza for 13$ (cheese only) and add some toppings (.50 for slice, 1$ for 10\" and 1.50$ for a 12\") we settled on the small pizza bc paying 14$ for 4 slices of pizza and 2 sodas is INSANE! We added pep and ham to our lil pizza and off she went and placed the order.  We waited for a few mins then went to Kidville to check it out. We came back and waited a little while longer and the pizza came out! We were sooo starving and were ready to eat! She set it on the pizza rack thing and I checked it out. It looked pretty yummy and I was excited to take a bite! I served my son a slice which was cheesy and hot, he got pep I got the ham. We each took a bite and I was like meh, its yummy but I expected a little more for the price. The slices were small and my son and I both ate 3 and were ready to go burn off the calories in the play area.  The pizza here is moderate, tastes fresh, and cheesy. Crust wasnt money by any means, I figured it would be soft and yummy... but it was kinda hard and thick... Dont get me wrong I love things hard and thick... just not my crust!! They arent greedy with the toppings and the pizza itself isnt overly greasy, or really that greasy for the matter.   I maybe might go back if we have to, the waitress was super nice and the place itself is clean. I just wasnt enthralled with the pizza, I would not compare this to NYC pizza at all. I would compare it to the frozen digorno pizzas. Anywho, 3 solid stars for this place! Loved our waitress!"}
{"text":"I don't get the bad reviews, decent NYC style slices for cheap.  I walked away happy with the pizza here, not in my top 10 worldwide but pretty freaking good still.  3 1/2 rounded up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Service was great inside looked really nice but the pizza was just ok. I just had the pepperoni pizza and thought the crust was a little doughy and tasted like a Costco pizza, which isn't bad but for it's price it could be better."}
{"text":"Small pizzeria downtown with decent pizza and fantastic customer service!   We originally came here to watch the Women's FIFA final (one of my girlfriend's a soccer fanatic) and took a seat the bar. The bartender working greeted us right away and offered us water and menus. We asked if they would put on the soccer game for us and there was a male worker (possibly a server or the manager?) who tried to get the game on the TVs without any luck. After 5 minutes or so he let us know they were having technical difficulties and wouldn't be able to play the game and apologized. We thanked him for trying and headed out in search of another bar since my friend was determined to watch this game.  We were heading towards Fremont and just passed The Park when the guy working on the TVs came running after us to let us know they were able to get the game on! We were still debating on where to go and were indecisive so we happily went back to Radio City Pizzeria.  The bartender welcomed us back and we ordered some drinks. I stuck with the house white wine and my friends had beers and the house red. We ordered a build your own pizza which was GINORMOUS! The 19\" pizza was more than enough to feed the 4 of us. There were many toppings to choose from (although they ran out of mushrooms) and we all agreed on a small variety of meat and veggies. The taste of the pizza was slightly above average but when you see it come out freshly baked, you can't complain!   The bartender was very attentive and ensured we always had a full alcoholic beverage and ice water in front of us. She was super sweet and engaged with us throughout the entire game. I didn't get her name but she had big, long wavy red hair. She definitely added to our pleasant experience at the pizzeria.   Drinks were pretty average priced around $6-$10 per draft beer/glass of wine. If I was craving pizza downtown I'd still prefer Pizza Rock.   I'd give this place 5 stars for their service and 3 for the food! I would give it an overall 3.5 if possible."}
{"text":"Pizza - GOOD!!! Customer service - UGH.  My friend and I saw this place was opening up months ago and we were very excited to try it. We always happy hour downtown at Vanguard so we figured this would be a perfect place to grab a bite of pizza after drinking. We assumed they'd offer pizza by the slice because pretty much every pizza joint Downtown does.  Upon entering we noted a hostess stand outside, but no hostess, so we walked in. The space is SMALL. As soon as we walked in we were already in the pizza place. There is no area to stand around and not look like a fool if you don't know where you're going. Luckily a hostess (who would turn into our waitress arrived). She asked if it were for two and we said yes, she seated us in their restaurant section which is basically right next to their bar section.   As for decor, it's nicely set up, except for the fact that there is an overload of televisions. And every single one of them was on basketball. My friend and I came to the conclusion that their space over at Tivoli Village must have been bigger and they just weren't willing to give up all those flat screens, so hey, just put 'em everywhere. Seriously guys, lose some of the TVs. Your customers will not miss them.  The night we were there they were offering a limited menu and they were upfront about it, which was nice. At least we didn't go through their full menu and decide on something they did not have. BUT we were disappointed to see the menu offered no option for just ordering by the slice. We got over it and decided to order an 18\" Viva Las Vegas which had pepperoni, a meat I can't remember right now, onions, yellow peppers and white sauce. All of their specialty pizzas sound really good and I would like to go back and try more. Sometimes places do specialty pizzas and you're like WTF? No. But RCP has really good-sounding concoctions.  Our pizza comes out and it looks delicious and smells delicious. We dig right in. First off the crust (for me) was perfect, crunchy, but had that nice chewy texture you get with good NY style pizza. The toppings were salty and sweet and just made this wonderful little pizza-goodness opera in my mouth.  Then comes the downfall of our whole experience....   We noted the pizza had not been cut completely. There were slices that actually should have been two slices and not one. I picked one up and it was bigger than my face, so naturally, we just asked if we could have the pizza cut. Our waitress then laid a lovely little explanation/insult on us.  \"Well, this is not Dominos or Pizza Hut, it's NY style pizza so it's bigger than you're used to.\"  EXCUSE ME? My friend and I were aghast as our haughty little waitress took our pizza away to be cut \"Dominos-style\" to our peasant liking (apparently). Instead of just cutting our pizza she insults us. Nice touch.  And you know what? I like Dominos AND Pizza Hut so there. Oh and by the way - if there's one food I know pretty much everything about - it's PIZZA! And I certainly know what a NY style slice of pizza looks like. Okay? Pizza is (langauge) fucking pizza, all right? So just cut my fucking pizza.  I want to go back to try more, but obviously my Dominos-ass should stay home and order pizza to be delivered."}
{"text":"RCP is by far my favorite Pizza in Las Vegas. It's always great and the Gluten Free Option is very good. When I'm not eating Pizza, I'm having the Meatball appetizer. It's fantastic.  Prices are very good for being on Fremont Street and the staff is friendly and make you feel at home. I'm there more for the people and the TV's than the food sometimes. Can't go wrong at RCP especially on a Fri or Saturday at 3am."}
{"text":"I came here after the Tivoli shopping crawl. It was chilly outside so we were in the mood for a hot pizza and some garlic knots.   We started with the garlic knots which were a bit tough. It might have been because the bottoms were burnt. The flavor was also weak ...there was not enough buttery garlic goodness in them.   The Viva Las Vegas Pizza 12\" ($15.95) made up for my disappointment in the knots. It had Sopressata ( Italian cured salami), roasted garlic, Ricotta Cheese, fresh mozzarella, roasted tomatoes, red onions , and sliced pepperoncinis. I liked that the salami was mild tasting without being overly salty. I also appreciated that they offered pepperoncinis on their pizza. The roasted tomatoes were a combination of salty and sweet . Yum!  The restaurant is a little small so during the winter with people going in and out you are likely to feel a brisk breeze.  I would suggest bringing a jacket just in case."}
{"text":"RCP is in a great location, and I like that they have indoor as well as outdoor seating. I've been there twice, and had a good experience the first time, not so great the second time.  I'm vegan, so both times I've ordered the calzone with Daiya cheese. The first time I visited RCP they got the order right with no problems and it was delicious. When I went yesterday, I again asked for the calzone with vegan cheese. When the order came out I discovered that the cook had used Daiya as well as Ricotta *and* Parmesan on top! I'm vegan for ethical reasons, but if I had been someone with a dairy allergy this would have been dangerous.  I spoke to the manager, who first blamed me for not clarifying that I didn't want the cow cheeses, though I think that's obvious from the fact that I asked for the *vegan* cheese. Then he blamed the poor waitress, who was new and just doing her best.  Anyway, be aware that you apparently have to be explicitly clear about what you want on your food there."}
{"text":"Experience:  Met a group of friends here for dinner. There was about 8 of us.  We got here at 6pm on a Thursday and we were the only patrons here. By the time we left two hours later, there were about 25 more people there.   Facility:  This is a dark modern place, that has a rocky roll kinda feel. All the other patrons were dressed in black...not sure if that was s coincidence or not. They have about 12 TVs showing various movies and sporting events. Music is a mix and not too loud to have a good conversation.   Service:  we got a cool waiter who was friendly, informative and easy on the eyes.   Food:  we ordered the cheese sticks to share and they were good.  They were homemade and came with a small portion of fries too.  Then we got two pizzas to share. The white pizza with mushrooms and the green pizza with eggplant.  The white pizza was my fav of the two, but could have used something like chopped tomatoes or black olives to cut the richness of the cheese.  The green pizza had a pesto sauce that was good, but the eggplant was flavorless.  I also tried two beers. One was the Troublesome Gose, which was a good one.  The other was the Bockor Vanderghinst. This one I really enjoyed.  It was a cross between grapefruit beer and a stout, but lighter.   Overall:  I liked this place. I would definitely come back with some friends. Good atmosphere, decent food, a little pricey, and great staff."}
{"text":"Last time we stopped in, it must have been earlier because you were able to order anything you wanted.  On this trip, it was past midnight and they were only serving pizza.  They really looked to be understaffed for a holiday weekend as the servers were having a hard time keeping up with the crowd.    When our pizza's were ready, they sat on the counter top until I got up and got them.  The cook was like, they will bring them to your table to which I said, they have been sitting her for a good 5 minutes and we have not seen the server, I will take them.  Drink refills were slow, basically any kind of service was slow but it was not the fault of the staff as they were working as hard as they could to stay on top of the crowd.  They all did a great job, but having mroe staff especially on a holiday weekend would make it run a lot better."}
{"text":"Their cream cheese jalapeño poppers changed my life.   They have vegan options so its a perfect place for all eaters!"}
{"text":"My family has been here a few times and we love the pizza and before yesterday the service was always good. Last night was another story, seems our waiter was having a bad night. We were sitting outside with our son and I had to ask the waiter 3 times for water. And each time he acted like I was asking for too much. Someone at another table complained about he attitude as well. Not sure if will be back, for the price we pay we should get good service period."}
{"text":"Radio City Pizza is the only place in Las Vegas that makes you feel like you're at an actual New York pizza joint. Right on Fremont st, RCP has a bar with great quality beers on tap(no bud light or coors) and top tier Brooklyn style pizza, speaking of which is one of the all around best pizzas I've ever tasted. 10/10 on mouth-feel alone. Great job RCO. Hope to see and enjoy you in LV for a long time."}
{"text":"The new and improved Radio City is such an upgrade food wise from the old menu/operation. As other reviewers have mentioned, neglect any review before 2015.  Gone are the $2 Bud Lights and the $5 Jameson/Ciroc taps, but they've replaced them with an incredible rotating beer, wine and spirit selection and impressive cocktail menu. There is always a sour beer on tap, which you don't find most other places in town. In the backyard is an Amaro bar which is totally unique and one of my favorite new spots to have a relaxing drink in town-- open in the evenings and you must enter through the alley. The food is improved in a major way, and the new operators have an impressive background from the Goodwich, Nobu, etc. so the offerings are a lot more gourmet. Give it a visit."}
{"text":"The worst pizza I've ever eaten! We were starving and ordered the Viva Las Vegas. I believe the Sopressata was rancid and picked it off. The crust was gooey and nasty. My bf loves meats and ate my pieces. The flavor of the meat permeated the cheese and I only ate some toppings so I had something in my tummy before attending a wine event! We left the event early as my bf started feeling Ill, nauseated by the time we got home and sick all night! I had much less discomfort which was 12 delay in the resulting surprise.  Worse than Chuck E Cheese! The cheap beer is the only thing that should be ordered here!"}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza and fast. Decently priced for the middle of down town. Go easy on the Parmesan, it's surprisingly high quality!"}
{"text":"There are so many bad reviews for this place, which really surprised me based on my experience. Not the best pizza in town, but it was still good. I ordered a slice with a couple of toppings, which were pretty loaded on. We split an order of meat balls, and they were pretty tasty! Our server was not overly attentive but she was friendly, made good suggestions, and made sure we were doing ok. Which I think is great...I don't like really in-your-face kind of service...especially when I'm trying to eat. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This pizza was awful! I dont even know where to start, the tasteless cheese, the crust which was either stale or just cooked so much that you couldn't even bite it unless you wanted to break a tooth....  The service was bad. Sat at the bar which was empty, and watched the bartender keep changing channels on the television. He was apparently too busy to see we had drank all of our drink and offer us a new one and either decided to ignore us or forgot when we asked for extra napkins.  This place is lame."}
{"text":"Came in last night (Saturday) for a slice. 15 minutes and $5 for a slice?! Egads. Ya'll gotta do better"}
{"text":"Note: This review is past due and it was for the time I visited during the month of March.   Incredibly slow service. There were only two people in the restaurant yet we got our god damn pizza 30 mins later. I was very furious. To top it off, there were only two tables that were occupied and 20 or something vacant ones. Anyways, we ordered the BBQ pizza and once we received it, our first bite into the pizza had BBQ sauce dripping everywhere my plate. That is because they basically downed the whole pizza in BBQ sauce. Me and my friend could not even finish the pizza because it was too drenched with BBQ sauce. However, the pig inside me still gobbled most of it since I do love BBQ pizza.  Seriously, I never want to give a place a one star, because unless they actually treated their customers like trash, that would be the underlying decision to give them a one star. They really need to work on their service because I can only imagine if they were actually busy...if they ever are."}
{"text":"It has improved since the last time. I love their white pizza with wild mushrooms. I also tried the rustic potatoes and I really enjoyed them. Service was much friendlier this time around."}
{"text":"A must stop in Vegas.  Great beer selection.  You must try the pizza.   One of the best thin crusts you will try.  Knowledgable staff and just a cool place to hang"}
{"text":"YUM, this place has great pizza!! You can order a whole pizza or order by the slice. They have a huge selection of toppings, which again, can be done on a whole pizza or by the slice. That build-your-own-pizza option of ordering is nice compared to just picking from per-determined combinations. My personal favorite is artichokes and tomato slices. Mmmm  The drink selections aren't particularly impressive, but they are good enough. As far as service, they are slow. That seems to be a trend downtown. Most of the time I don't mind this, but as far as lunch breaks go: order everything all at once, then request the check when the food starts arriving.   The first time I ate here, it was very hot. The air conditioning must have been broken. I haven't noticed this as a problem after that initial visit. Last bit of info., they have a ton of TVs. This is a great spot to watch sports, drink beer, and eat pizza."}
{"text":"Let's just get to what you people read my reviews for: VEGAN PIZZA. With (plenty of) Daiya!  I was pretty psyched when I heard that RCP was offering a vegan cheez alternative on their pizzas, so I made the voyage to Bougieland with some friends to try it out.  They'll charge you $2 extra for the vegan cheese, but at least they don't skimp! I got a 12\" pizza with bell peppers (ahem, green peppers - don't play me like I might be getting red!) and artichoke hearts.  The crust was good (although I like mine a little more done; it could have had another minute or two in the oven for my taste).  And the leftover pizza was good both cold right out of the fridge and reheated in the microwave.  So, what's the downside? Service is not great.  Ambiance is a little lacking.  There are some nice high tables near the kitchen area, then there's the \"kids area.\"  We seemed to be surrounded by tables with children the whole time we were there.... What can you do? It was a busy day.... And there is no restroom.  You have to go outside, down the way, but I guess that's pretty common at Tivoli.    Beware that most of their bottles of wine are actually half bottles.  We made that mistake and ended up with three people each getting 2/3 glass of wine.  Which was delicious, as it should be for $56/bottle.  Our bad for not reading closely, but I think we all felt it was a little underhanded.... My other complaint is that the (red) wine was freaking COLD.  This is not cold duck! This is a decent red wine....should be no colder than 60 deg.  This was like 40-45.  So, skip the wine, and go for the $1 PBR instead.  I'll definitely get their pizza again; but next time, I'll probably just call for takeout."}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant.  The food was delicious. The service was good and our food arrived fast. We visited the restaurant last Friday. We sat in the back patio area. We brought our 8 month old son and there was plenty of room for his stroller. Our server was busy but he still took good care of us.  The ONLY reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because they didn't have high chairs. :("}
{"text":"I'm happy that there's a nice little restaurant in addition to Le Thai in \"hipster alley\" on Fremont!  The place is really nice and the food is good and decently priced!  On the other hand I had an issue with the TVs around the whole place.  TVs are totally fine, it's a sports bar, I get that, but the volume was up so high!  There wasn't even a big game on ... it was all a bunch of highlights.  When there isn't a game on, I figured the TVs should be turned down and music should be turned up ... but not too loud!  I felt like I was yelling at my friend ... which isn't okay for a restaurant."}
{"text":"We were thrilled to find this choice since we didn't want a $8.99 prime rib type meal or fast food on Freemont Street. Excellent small plate choices, classic New York style pizza and some great combinations. They also have a nice beer selection on tap.  We had a classic red ny pizza with meatballs, garlic and pepperoni and it was perfect. My arugula salad was light and fresh with the perfect addition of dressing to compliment the walnuts and blue cheese. My boyfriend was thrilled with the beer from Denmark on tap. I couldn't help but sneak a peak at our neighbor table and regretted not ordering the gnocchi! It looked amazing.  Great atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating. More expensive than a lot of options on that street but still a good deal for Vegas."}
{"text":"Can't beat the atmosphere or the food from this place. Great place to watch big games, or just to grab a quick bite to eat. The owner/manager fellow is great as well, will definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"Ok, so what the heck is with the mediocre restaurants downtown Las Vegas charging prices that are ridiculous. I'm sorry but I dont care how many hipsters hang around. No thanks."}
{"text":"\"Amazing pizza?\" I was asked by my lovely server. \"indubitably!\" I concurred. Bringing my heart broken friend to mend his sulking heart by eating 'amazing' pizza was the best remedy indeed!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the pizza and customer service. The owner was too kind almost. Called us by name the whole time we were there, came over to chat and just see if we needed anything. Shook our hands when we left....felt like celebrities! Haha. The pizza was great. we decided on two kinds, cant remember the second but we did get \"The White\" It was pretty darn good. So was the other. Small spot, loud music, good vibe. I wouldn't mind coming back and trying other options. RCP, you got a fan!"}
{"text":"Yikes....if this is an example of what to expect at Tivoli Village in Summerlin I'm gonna be very disappointed.  Walking in I was impressed with the place. Very nice looking with comfortable seating spread out indoors and outdoors.  A little warm today to eat outside IMO but can imagine at night it would be great.  Ordered some garlic knots and a meatball sandwich.  Garlic knots - I knew this was trouble the moment I looked at them.  You ever buy a sourdough roll at Albertson's or something like that?  The outside of the bread looks tough and really chewy?  Yup....that's what the garlic knots are like here.  The outside of the bread is just disgusting.  It was inedible.  They painted some butter and garlic on it but not really enough even if the bread was good.  I can't believe they served me that. Meatball sub - Meatballs were lukewarm.  Not sure what that means but fear it's cause they reheated it.  Though honestly the meatball itself had good flavor and was juicy enough inside.  The sauce, however, was gross.  They put way too much on so it slobbered everywhere and it tasted way too sweet.  Not sure if it's homemade or from a can - I'd guess from a can.    I have no idea why I'm not giving this one star since the service wasn't very good either - they did have more employees than customers when I went yet the staff was kind of sitting around chatting while some people needed service.  Not really a very well run place either food or service wise.  I did like my waitress.  She was nice even though not very attentive.  She made a pretty awful Arnold Palmer but was nice and asked if I liked the garlic knots.  Feel bad lying to her that they were good.  If you're eager to try this place I would do so in the next 6 months.  I can't imagine this place lasting very long unless Tivoli really takes off with the foot traffic."}
{"text":"We decided to visit this new pizzeria after a local downtown lowdown meeting on the new and upcoming businesses downtown.  I was super excited because it seems like they were one of the many new businesses making a difference to Fremont East.    When you walk into the place, you're pleasantly surprise by the clean lines of the restaurant.  Nice floors, separate bar area and dining area and the fact that there are many TVs in the establishments.  We were super excited to try the food!  Our servers were super nice as well.  I remember a tall guy with tattoos named Chase.  He was more the servers assistant but super cool.  Our server, with glasses and a fauxhawk, was super accommodating.  He was attentive and really kept coming back and checking on us.    You're probably wondering why I gave the amount of stars.  It's because of the food.  We started off with a few appetizers:  garlic fries, garlic chips and wings.  The garlic fries and chips were flavorful, I'll give you that.  The problem was that it was DRENCHED in oil.  I could feel a new pimple pop out with every bite.  Definitely not something I would recommend.  If there was one that was better, it would be the fries because it seemed like less oil.  The wings were packed with flavor and wasn't hot, which is a good thing, but a little soggy and not crispy how I prefer wings.  Then there was the pizza.  We got the meat lovers which I was excited for.  The toppings were top notch.  You can tell they use great ingredients in this pizza.  The problem was the crust.  It didn't WOW me and almost seemed like it was a frozen crust rather than homemade.  Here's the plus:  The ranch!  I don't consider myself to have a super advanced palate, however, I know my taste buds love it.  The ranch along really saved a lot of the dishes for me.  Given the interior, staff and of course ranch, I didn't feel like they deserved a lower score, however, they need to focus on less greasier food.  I think it'll do well regardless because of the location, especially after a night full of drinking.  If you're looking for a sit down dinner, I wouldn't necessarily consider this place.  I'm hoping my next visit will be better.  I'm not about to give up on this place because of their involvement in the downtown revitalization!"}
{"text":"Amazing quality. Super excited for their amaro bar.  Pizza is excellent but be sure to try their other dishes. The skills in the kitchen are no joke. Really good food."}
{"text":"After my first experience here, the food was good, but the service... ditzy. Does anyone who works here know what they're doing? I figured they'd just transitioned to the new downtown location and needed to work out some kinks. The issues weren't bad enough that I wouldn't come back, so I decided to give them a second chance.   Second chance, we called in an order to go. Just a large pepperoni pizza, nothing too difficult. The girl on the phone sounded super confused like she didn't know what was going on and my husband even commented that he was worried we'd get there and there would be a problem with the order. So we get there, I tell them I called in and order, and the 5 people working there all look around at each other and say, \"I didn't take an order\". After telling them, \"Someone answered the phone because I placed an order\" a girl comes out of the back and said she as the one who took the order. She handed us the pizza and didn't say anything. I had to ask what we owed. She looked lost and confused like she was on pills. The rest of the staff then tried to overcompensate by being phony friendly, which I wasn't going to buy since one of the girls was on her cell phone texting and wouldn't look at us.   Overall, the food isn't bad, but I'm not sure it's worth dealing with the incompetent staff. I may give them one final chance before writing them off altogether."}
{"text":"This place seems like two people are running it and neither of them speak to one another. Everything on the menu is confusing and it's like it's in stereo. My wife and are locals and we frequent the downtown/Fremont Street area often. We hadn't had a chance to eat at RCP yet so we gave it a shot there while we were waiting for some friends to arrive in the area this past weekend. WOW were we disappointed.   We walked in the restaurant at 1PM on a Saturday and the place was completely empty. We were politely told to seat ourselves and we did. The waitress hurried over and asked if we wanted anything to drink. This is where the frustrations started. My wife asked for an iced tea and was told they don't serve it there. WTF? What kind of restaurant doesn't serve iced tea???? She said water would be fine. I was lured by the special on the chalkboard outside which was 2 slices of pizza and a beer for $7.99. I asked if I could substitute a cider for the beer and was told that the beer choices were only bud or bud lite...so, basically, swill and lite swill. I said I would like a Sam Adams instead and was told they were out of that and three other beers. Oooookay. I just asked for a diet coke and left it at that. She leaves to get our drinks and comes back. The waters were in cheap plastic cups but the diet soda was in a glass. Very odd.  So we order. We decided to split their Italian Sausage platter as an appetizer and for an entree my wife orders a slice of the Chicken Pesto pizza and I decide to go for the cheaper special and get two slices of pizza and a soda for $5. I ordered a Supreme and Pepperoni slice. Nope...can't do that either. It has to be cheese to qualify for the special. \"Screw it, just bring me one slice of Supreme then!\" I said. A few refills on our drinks and then, when I thought our appetizer was coming out, here arrives our pizza. \"The cook said the sausage takes a bit longer so I'll bring that out when it's done, OK?\"  Fine. We look, and both our pizza slices were on cheap paper plates. Very low class. We also notice that my wife's Chicken Pesto pizza was actually just a slice of cheese so the order was taken or made wrong. At this point, she just didn't care to say anything so she ate it. Both pizzas were OK but certainly nothing spectacular. If you told me it came from Dominos I wouldn't have been shocked. Five minutes later the sausages came out. On paper plates? Nope, this was served in a dish. Like I said, it's as if two people run the place and neither of them talk. The sausage platter looked nice but was extremely bland even though it was smothered in onions and peppers. Truly, it was made by someone with no tastebuds.   We got our check and at least the waitress rang us up for a 2-slice and soda special but the order was wrong anyway so I'm not sure what to say there. The more we looked at the menu and specials though, the more we got confused. it's the only pizza place I've ever been to where a slice of cheese pizza is $3.50 but if you add pepperoni to it, it's only $3.00. So if you eat there, it's actually cheaper to order a pepperoni pizza and pick off the pepperoni if you only want cheese. Stupid. We left as soon as we could and would not go back until they get new recipes and someone who actually knows a little bit about how to run a menu."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite downtown restaurants. It is under new ownership (run by the man who owns Goodwich) with a fantastic new menu. I only wish he had rebranded the restaurant because the name is tainted by its first iteration.   The pizzas are tasty and unique, buffalo wings are flavorful and juicy, and the other menu items that I have tried (Brussels sprouts and gnocchi) were great. The beer selection is good enough for the beer snobby hipster crowd as well."}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice at $3 per slice and 50 cents per topping (after one, I think) was exactly what I wanted last night.  After an art show across the street, my fella and I were hungry, and he saw Radio City.   We walked over and were seated right away.  Service was super quick, polite, and knowledgeable. I asked our server what he recommended, and he made a comment about the chorizo.  I ordered one slice with chorizo, olives, and mushrooms.  Excellent choice.   The toppings were great, and the pizza was really good, but I loved the crust the most!  Crispy, but not burnt, nice and thin, it was the perfect texture for a thin pizza.   Fella thoroughly enjoyed his pizza as well.    $10.27 for 2 slices of pizza with 3 and 4 toppings each isn't bad.  I was shocked when I first saw it, but then I reminded myself that I AM downtown, after all, and things are a little pricey here.   I will definitely be back again, to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME!!! No matter how tanked my crew of 6 was from Griffon, they welcomed us with open arms! Not only did this place have the best garlic parmesean fries ever ( 2 orders) but their pizza was out of this world! Living in NY for 5 years I have very high expectations, but I can say it tasted like they are flying in the water from Italy!!! The staff was young hot and cool and the prices were totally Downtown! Just like a local loves it! The owner walked by our table to make sure we were happy....we gave him some drunk jargen and he was so cool, he bought a round of their cannolis!!!! FFFFFUUUUUUU.....best I ever had! Thank you Radio City, this place is going to be a hit!!!!! Can't wait for Summer!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great . . . it reminded my of some of the small pizza joints in New York City . . . and the pizza was pretty good as well.  We ordered the Radio City Meat Luvers Pizza . . . it had plenty of toppings . . . just the right amount of cheese . . . an a very tasty sauce.  The crust was crispy and also had a good taste.  I am torn though . . . with another great pizza place in the area . . . I may only make it down here when I come to Fremont East to drink . . . and that is not a bad thing . . . since that is usually a couple of times each Las Vegas Trip.  But definitely on my . . . I will be back list."}
{"text":"Me and my husband needed a quick bite to eat before heading to Las Vegas Country Saloon for a metal concert. Once we seen Radio City Pizzeria's by-the-slice window, we were sold. The pizza here starts at $4 per slice and is $0.50 extra for toppings. Fountain drinks were $3. Ordering was easy enough, but surprisingly enough they didn't have slices on hand. We waited about 10 minutes, and those pizza slices were literally fresh out of the oven.  While we were sitting out in the patio area waiting for our slices, we witnessed a verbal argument by two homeless males fighting over territory. Another toothless guy interrupted my husband mid-bite to ask him about his t-shirt (a Cannibal Corpse shirt may provoke some questions). You might want to eat inside and avoid the patio, just saying.   The pizzas were pretty mediocre. There was something about them that was off. Plus, it irked me that our small meal cost $17! One more thing - the fountain drink cups are small. They only have one size, and I'm not sure if they give refills. At least the staff are friendly! The guy working at the window brought the pizzas to our table and gave us Parmesan cheese and red pepper shakes.        Worth a Return Visit? IMO, Pizza Rock Slices are waaay better. Radio City is convenient when you're in the area though. I'd probably come back if I was in a rush.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #130"}
{"text":"My family and I came here to eat and it was Fantastic!   The service was outstanding and the warm beets were to die for."}
{"text":"So after eating here last night, I realize that there are few places that are creating this wonderful of food in vegas! My tastebuds danced and sang. I can't wait to go back! The service can use a little work, but do yourself a favor and go!"}
{"text":"I was craving curly fries real bad and was disappointed that nobody in Container Park serves fries so, we walked to a kabob place that supposedly has good gyro and fries but they were closing by the time we got there. So, we ended up at RCP. They have fries!  I ordered garlic Parmesan fries and meat luvers pizza. While waiting for the food, we found smut tucked in the menu holder. Jana and BJ were hot. I'm not sure why I got a whole  pie when I wanted only a slice.   Garlic Parmesan Fries: Oh this was yummy. Fry craving was definitely satisfied. Not super garlicky but still tasty. 5/5  Meat Luvers: How they spell lovers bothers me but whatever. The crust and edges of the pie were good but was very soggy towards the middle. I picked up a slice and all my toppings slid off. It was a good pizza but I don't like my pizza toppings on my scarf. 3/5  The manager comes over to us asking about \"our\" smut. We're innocent!"}
{"text":"I had to knock the star off because Ciroc was on special (I wouldn't normally drink it because of the whole p diddy thing...brand ambassador my ass) and it SEEMS as though it pours from a tap on the bar but NO....it comes from the bottle.  Talk about a gyp!   The pizza was effing delicious and we had WAY more than was necessary.   Carolyn/Caroline?  The red headed hotness behind the counter was fun and down to make sure we had a great time.   We had to sit by some hungover dudes but soon were downing shots like it was the night before thanksgiving and we were going to be so hammered that meeting inlaws wouldn't matter.  Get the pizza...get the beer...get the drinks...make sure they know you are there to have fun and it will be cheap!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, but sadly i did not get a chance. They advertise that they deliver, but apparently only on busy days, don't know which day that is. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The pizza is not bad. The crust had a great texture and they are generous with their toppings. A group of eight was able to share two pizzas, two salads, two appetizers, and a sandwich with leftovers.     I am perplexed by how restaurants perpetually run out of products. It seemed like half the items we wanted were out that day.  The limited items that were available were decent.    The Chili cheese fries were a hit and miss.  The fries are crispy. The Chili was good. The cheese was not the artificial sauce. It was half a slice of Kraft singles torn on top without being melted.   The Caesar and caprese salads are nothing special. u don't really expect pizza places to serve a mean green option. One of these days maybe one will surprise me.   The pizzas themselves had a good chewiness without being too doughy.  They are thinner yet not cracker like. Each 18 inch pie is cut into eight slices. I could only eat one slice after all the starters. The meat lovers was the first to go. The Supreme was more my style. If only they had the Mac'n Cheese pizza.  A fat kids dream.   The Philly was okay.  Nothing special.   The beers look overpriced. Once you see that they serve 22.5 ounce bottles instead of the normal 12, it makes sense.   The service is slim, but not in a bad way.  One server for the whole restaurant.  She popped in enough to make sure we had everything and wasn't intrusive."}
{"text":"Food: Viva Las Vegas pizza - This pizza was quite tasty! There was a generous amount of cheese and the roasted garlic really came through. The fire roasted tomatoes were a great touch!  Garlic parmesan chips - Although, a little on the greasy side, these were amazing!   Service: We got our order to go. This is an extremely small restaurant, so if you plan to dine there expect a bit of a wait. The employees looked a bit lost at times, but all in all we had a good experience."}
{"text":"A friend told me,\"You cant write a review of where you work\". My opinion, that's a load of malarckey! So, as usual, im gonna write from the heart & tell you the thoughts that follow me home. 1st, the vanilla shallot salad dressing; why oh why, dont you bottle it?! When im home & make a salad, I get sad, cause I dont have it. I could lick this stuff off of anything. Trust me, I mean anything....close to anything. Ooooh...bottle the hot sauce also!  Now, lets address my subconscious; my dreams about the Mamma G's Stuffed Chicken. Put aside the strange details & Freudian implications, the flavors marry so eloquently, every peron I recommend it to has been thrilled. I had one customer text the menu description & photo of the entree, to his wife, letting her know what he was enjoying, while she was at work...ouch, low blow, but still a sign of apprectiation. Lastly the chicken fingers & pizza. To me,pizza is defined by the sauce. Sometimes, I imagine ordering a large 18in for myself, just to take that perfect first bite out of every piece at the center. We like to joke,\"I cant believe I swallowed all 18in\". Yet, where there's a will, there's a way. The chicken fingers....are the best i've ever had. I know the secret to them, but i'd be fired if I told. Oh, yeh, they love NY sports teams there...ALOT! I'm from Boston, thus, I only compliment them when I believe it to be true. I love working at Radio City & am proud enough to scream it from the rafters. I love the customers, my friends, family & staff & mostly, the food. I am what's called, a foodie. Foodies never ever lie about food."}
{"text":"What a surprise. Came here hoping to eat healthy and I had a salad and asparagus.   Really good grilled asparagus, prepared simply.  Try to chefs salad, fresh greens, julienned veggies and nice dressing, not overdone,  Next time when I'm not eating so well I'll have the Viva Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Service was terrible and the pizza was only decent. The servers totally skipped my girlfriend and I in the service queue, and when we asked them about our pizza, they just said \"it'll be out soon.\" But it wasn't. We had to shanghai someone else's pizza, and tell the staff to serve them next.   Decent prices (two slices and beer for $7? Not bad!) But I wouldn't choose this place again."}
{"text":"This place sucked when it was open. It looks like it closed down now. Good riddance  I never had good food or good servoce here. I was here a total of 3 times and each time sucked in a different way. The food was god awful, expensive,  and the service was shaky at best."}
{"text":"OMG!  Get the burger pizza.... It even comes with French Fries in it...so good... To hot to sit outside but I love this place.... I used to go to the Summerlin location but then I found this location and love it times a zillion!!!!! So happy!"}
{"text":"I don't think we will be returning.  We were greeted at the door by the hostess and a gentleman who checked our ID's. The hostess asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar and I said \"No, we'd prefer a table\", so she led us to our  table which was directly across from the bar. She handed us our menus and she said that they just opened recently so they only have a limited menu. We were fine with that. The waitress came over a couple of minutes later to take our drink orders. She returned with our drinks and took our food order. I ordered the garden salad and my boyfriend ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich. She asked me if I wanted anything else besides the salad and I said no.  About 7 minutes later, the runner comes out with the salad but no sandwich. Anyway, we figured it would be coming out soon, but no, it never did. And, of course, I did not want to start eating my salad before my boyfriend even gets his food.  We wanted both orders out at the same time. So, I waited, and waited, and waited. About 12 minutes later the waitress comes by and says to my boyfriend \"oh, you didn't get your sandwich?\". He says \"no\". She goes away and comes back about 2 minutes later and tells us that his sandwich was given to another table and that it would take five minutes to make a new one.  UGH!!!  At this point, I did not want to wait the five minutes. There was no guarantee that it would only take five minutes, what if it took 10 minutes? So, I asked her to cancel the whole order.  I told her that I had not touch my salad because I wanted to eat at the same time as my boyfriend. She said \"OK\", and we left.  BTW, I don't blame the waitress, it wasn't her who brought out the food."}
{"text":"Pizza was great and reasonably priced.  Didn't get 5 stars because they only offer one size of pizza.  We had 3 people and couldn't agree on what to get so we would have really liked to order 2 medium pizzas, but that wasn't an option."}
{"text":"We are on Vegas for a Dj Tour. Yesterday we discovered this amazing place!! The food is delicious! Yesterday Judy actually walked outside & told us the food was great and to try it out. We came in not knowing who she was. It wasn't till later that the waitress told us who she was. By the way our waitress was amazing. Her & Judy are the reason we came back.  Today however I'm extremely upset. My appetite went away. Our waitress Toni, I asked her name so I'm hoping she didn't lie. She was extremely rude & NOT helpful. The $50 of food we ordered came, we asked for sides of ranch & BBQ and she charges us, we were not charged yesterday. I asked why the wings are dry and she had the nerve to say \"I didn't cook it\" really? So I asked \"if you can't ask the cook I definitely don't mind asking\" she rolled her eyes and asked of extra sides were okay.  I'm sorry but I thought I was paying for food & service?   I'm never coming here again & better believe this waitress got NO TIP. We took all our food to go.   Sad that I didn't have time to leave a review yesterday. And upset that this poorly educated waitress ruined my experience at Radio City Pizza.  Sorry Jodi. Place is great. Food is delicious. However customer service can make or break an experience. Toni should be behind a cash register or washing dishes not ruining people's lunch with her attitude."}
{"text":"Now that they're touting a gourmet menu that goes way beyond any Italian pie joint in the vicinity, every review before 2015 should be ignored.  You'll be doing a disservice to yourself going the traditional route of a sausage and mushroom pizza.  \"Radicchio\" kicked off our meal with shaved root vegetables, herbs, and vinaigrette.  The plate wowed in its mix of color, delightful crunch of garden greens, and a bitter, acidic finish that I found surprisingly refreshing.  I could see how the bitterness could be off putting for some though.  This pummeled any lame lettuce, tomato, salad with dressing from a jar that the average pizzeria pushes out.  \"Coniglio con Conchiglie\", basically a rich kid's mac and cheese, is filled with braised rabbit, sugo di formmagi, shell pasta, zucchini and coriander.  It's what initially piqued my interest to check out RCP again, and it'll be the dish that will have me coming back.  I resisted the urge to mix everything together to get more rabbit flavor, but that ended in mere minutes since the cheese sauce was so damn good.  I'd brush my teeth with that shit.  The calamari was also delicious.  The tender rings of sautéed squid with herbed parsnip puree, eggplant and crispy shallots went marvelously together.    Instead of going with dessert, we finished with pizza slices (oink).  I so badly wanted chicken oysters which were only available as a pizza topping.  That needs to change!  Chopping up the best part of the bird isn't the ideal way to serve this.   Chicken oyster entrée, please?"}
{"text":"Here is how I see it.  5 stars for the food. 10 stars for the service. (I wish I could give them the ten) 5 stars for the buck.50 new castle. Oh, by the way 50 cent pbr. I love the pizza. The food is great..."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  The special they were advertising sounded promising -- two slices of pizza and a soda for $5 -- but my god was the pizza awful. Bland, seemingly canned sauce. Doughy. Remarkably flavorless toppings. My starving dining companion ate two bites before giving up, prefering hunger to the culinary offense that is Radio City Pizza. And the whole place just had a weird, musty smell.  I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"I love love LOVE RCP! I make it over here at LEAST two or three times a week.  Radio City Pizza is a must stop if your are hanging out on Fremont East. Always open late which is great for night owls and late nighters. The website says they are open until you stop drinking, so make sure to make this stop! Ciroc lines the walls and if you are lucky you might get a shot on the house! ;) Lance is a totally sweetie, but don't try to carry on a conversation while you order because the slice you ordered might not be the slice you get! Regardless, ALL their pies are tasty. The patio is fun to sit out on as well... Weather permitting. Full bar, great menu, and great vibe. I rarely see an empty seat in the place!  I love me some sports.. especially basketball. They have nice big TVs all over the restaurant and a giant one over the bar. That's where I usually am.  When it comes to the pizza I am a HUUUUGGEE fan of the BBQ Chicken. Probably the best Ive ever had. The white is amazing too. Touching back on the \"convo with Lance\" comment, I asked for BBQ Chicken one night and he brought us Buffalo Chicken instead. I'm not a big fan of spicy, but guess what.... STILL AMAZING.  The owners are usually on site which is great. I was getting hassled and hit on once by a guy that was SUPER wasted drunk and Elias quietly had him and his comrades booted from the joint. No riffraff allowed here. Then we were given shots on the house and most of our bill was taken care of. I think we paid for maybe two slices out of our feast.   All in all, if you have an hour to spare or even more I would make your way over to Radio City Pizza!!!"}
{"text":"First let me say, dear RCP you lost 2 costumers over ONE DOLLER.  Here is what happened the menu listed a bottle of water for $5, and our servers I-phone said it was $6. I mention it to the server and her response is; well that's what my phone says. So fast forward to getting the check and it 's still is $6 for the water. The server comes back over to take the check and I say, \"I guess you're not going to give us the price on the menu.\" I got a blank stare and she took the check over to the bartender and hostess and proceeded to whisper about how to deal with us. As we got up we had to walk out right in front of them we got nothing, not a \"we're sorry for the confusion on the menu\" or  \"thanks for coming\" or \"goodnight\"... nothing.  On to the other problem, we had the Chicken Caprese Pizza. The ingredients are Chicken,cheese,tomatoes, fresh basil and balsamic. We got that and... warm mixed greens WTF? If I wanted a salad, I would have order it. I am not sure if they were subbing for the lack of basil or had extra mixed greens lying around, but they wound up on out pizza. Also, when the first ingredient is chicken and there are more mixed greens on the pizza than chicken, I feel mislead. There is really good pizza and good service in town and I don't think it's at RCP. There is one bright spot, the guy who was not our server with the tattoos. He was very nice and wrapped our salad-less pizza in foil so we did not have to take a big box home."}
{"text":"Great slice, lots of tv's to watch the game."}
{"text":"Pizza was good but it wasn't the best that I have ever had.  I ended up just getting a slice for $2.50 before you add .50 cents for every topping you want to add on.  If you want a whole pie its going to run you about $20 for an 18 inch. Music was LOUD and they id you before they even let you in.  What I thought was cool that has nothing to do with this place at all is that Corey from Pawn stars and his wife ended up being seated behind us Oh! One last thing you can play beer pong in the back for $25 package deal."}
{"text":"Friday night routine, take out Wifee & kids plus kids buddies for dinner. We've seem Radio City Pizzeria whenever we've wandered around the classy but still quiet Tivoli Village.  Quite a small restaurant with a nice bar showing football, guys with baseball hats, shouting. Am I in a sports bar?  We have to wait 30 minutes to get a table for 7 people. That's ok, the male minors & I head to Brookstone & Land Rover. Females head to clothing stores. Everybody happy.  We return on time and the squeeze us onto a table that should seat 8 but the tables are small and it's a little tight. The hostess is super charming and we are delighted to sit down.  Order large (18\") cheese pie & small (12\") meat lover plus sides of chicken tenders, fries and garlic knots. Beer is 50c? Pabst, I have never tried Pabst but 50c! Good.  Wifee chose from a surprisingly large wine list and enjoyed a nice Ferrari Chardonnay for $13 a glass. She only had one glass!  Pizza was very hot with ample toppings, sides were fine and we left with full bellies. $76 plus tip for 7 people.   Not where to go if you're counting calories but enjoyable and we'll go back."}
{"text":"A little light on the toppings when you order by the slice. They have a good selection of beer and every seat in the dining room has view of a TV. Service is friendly but a little slow. The back patio is lovely and inviting."}
{"text":"1st of all- $.50 PBR. Let me give you a minute to let that sink it.......got it? Good. We spent $12 on beer. Seriously. It was awesome.The people who work here are chill and pretty cool. We ordered 2 pizzas between 3 of us (I know, I know, we're such fatties). We got the hamburger pizza and the Viva Las Vegas. The hamburger pizza was weird. It tasted just like a hamburger, fries and all. (It even had ketchup!). We ordered it cuz the waiter recommended it. Needless to say, I won't order that again. The Viva Las Vegas though, was MUCH better. Granted, we ordered that later in the night when my taste buds were less discerning. The best thing of the night was the garlic knots. HOLY $h!T, they were amazing!! I ate 2 of them, and I wage a holy war against carbs. Yes, THAT GOOD. For a perfect night, order a couple of beers and garlic knots. You'll thank me."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a while now and loved it at first because the prices were great. This place really started to irritate me when they changed the menu and got rid of PBR. We came here for the cheap pitchers and my fiancé loves the wings, but once the prices went up on the entire menu we decided the pizza isn't good enough to warrant the price. Cheap PBR was your only saving grace Radio City Pizza.. It was a sad day when it was gone."}
{"text":"Wandering around the area, I was looking for a quick lunch spot. I finally decided on Radio City Pizza after walking around in the heat way too long.  I walked in and the place was empty aside from one other customer dining alone. The waitress told me to choose any seat I liked and promptly brought me over a much-needed glass of water.   I quickly looked over the menu and decided on a single slice with broccoli rabe and eggplant. They have the option of single slices for $4 and 50 cents per topping added. $5 for a slice was a little high but it gets cheaper if you order an entire pie.   Service was very friendly and attentive. Since there were so few customers the waitress made sure to refill my drink often and that was appreciated due to the extreme heat.   The pizza was a little on the crispy side and I didn't love the crust. I rarely skip eating the crust and it's usually my favorite part but I didn't bother with this one. The toppings were plentiful and I liked the sauce but overall the pizza was just ok.   I'd be interested in trying this place again with a group so I could try a whole pizza, but I won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"tried the white pizza.  I like the thin crust, but it could use more cheese(Filippi's is way better).  I took it to go; I want to dine in next time, place seems real fun.  intrigued by the menu, wanna try lots of items"}
{"text":"I love New York Pizza thus I was very excited to try this place out. Thank God for yummy ranch and honey mustard. It is the only reason why I was able to finish my lunch. I ordered a white pizza for myself and a side order of chicken tenders and fries for my daughter. We were starving so the second the food was placed on our table, my 3.5 year old daughter grabbed a fry and spit it out because it was so salty. On the other end of the spectrum, the chicken tenders weren't seasoned enough. Hence, the need for honey mustard. And ketchup. And ranch.   Since it's a pizzeria, I was hoping that the pizza would be better, but the slice I was given was lacking in toppings and the crust was dry and hard. Again, ranch to the rescue.  The ladies at the table next to me looked like they were enjoying there salads, so maybe I will give them another try and hopefully update this review. The guys working there were friendly and it might be a cool place to stop in for a beer or drink. Just next time, I will get a pizza made to order (fresh out of the oven) instead of ordering by the slice."}
{"text":"What a great find on Fremont. $3 beer,  good pizza and a willingness to alter their options to accommodate someone who is lactose intolerant. What more could you ask for?  I tend to steer clear of the over-priced and pretentious restaurants and bars near this end of Fremont, but this place was a wonderful surprise. I instantly felt as though we were the most important guests there, when there were tons of others. And the decor and vibe made me feel as though I was back on  the east coast.  The pizza selection  is simple but awesome. The wings are delicious and I love the calzones. GO AHEAD...  YOU KNOW YOU WANNA TRY IT."}
