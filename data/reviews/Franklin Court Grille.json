{"text":"I came to town for the weekend to visit my partner who was here for work. I was so hungry, but i don't like to eat at chain restaurants when i'm out of town. I like to dine at local restaurants. By doing this, i can usually find restaurant gems...and Franklin Court Grille is DEFINITELY a gem! This restaurant is amazing! The customer service was absolutely impeccable and the food was even better!!!!! The chef/owner came out to chat with us.  Both of them were very nice. Our server was great as well!  For starters, we ordered wings. They came out piping hot. They were delicious! I ordered ranch dressing and i promise the ranch dressing will CHANGE YOUR LIFE! It is definitely not store bought ranch. For our entrees, i ordered the turkey Reuben and my partner got the Best of Both Worlds burger. Both of us ordered fries. The handcut fries were the best fries I've ever had in my life (and I've eaten ALOT of fries). My partner hummed \"Mmmmmm\" the entire time he was eating his burger. The Reuben was really good too! It was so big that I took half of it home to eat later on. Whenever in Monroe, I will make Franklin Court Grill one of my stops."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Very reasonably priced. Best lunch and dinner in town!! Ask about the specials when you go in. The salads are impressive. I had the corn chowder today and the Carolina burger with fries. All of it was wonderful. I also had the peanut butter pie for desert and it was to die for. I will be going back."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars  but due to the lack of seasoning in their meat, I'll take one back. The prime rib is awesome u can say that , is usually the special on Saturday nights. But on other occasions I've personally had the salmon, rib eye and the pork chops all cooked without any type of season. I think you should have an option as to whether you want your meat cooked with or without it."}
{"text":"One word!  Wow!  This place is excellent.  Fair prices and Excellent quality and taste.  The cream of mushroom soup, the fresh salad with house made dressings were fantastic.    Country fried steak, mashed potatoes with a dark beer gravy.  Entire table of 6 is very happy and impressed!  The staff is pleasant, professional and friendly!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other afternoon after someone recommended it to me and I will definitely be back.  My husband ordered the burger with bacon and said it was one of the best he's had.  I had the Ford Galaxy salad with tuna and it was delicious!   The salad was so fresh and loaded with veggies and the tuna wasn't over cooked.  They have dressing suggestions with the salads and this one suggested the maple vinaigrette.  It was a little too sweet for me but they serve the dressings on the side so I was able to get something different."}
{"text":"This place has a pleassnt stmosphere.  Not terribly loud, but definitely not quiet.  The setting is nice, adjoining a brick courtyard in a nice part of town. The wait staff was cheerful, but when they assured me that the oil for the salad was olive, it turned out not to be. The waitress said probably some of the new people had filled the cruet with a cooking oil. But she didn't offer to replace it with the proper oil. My salad was large and attractive, but disgustingly sweet with the balsamic vinaigrette and the sugar infused cranberries. The Portobello on the salad was terrific and the greens were fresh and of good quality. The meal was served very late, because the waitress discovered that our order had somehow gotten lost. A dinner companion could not get decaf tea, which seems like a reasonable option. Although it is a nicer place than many, I would not return."}
{"text":"Wow!  Amazing lunch today with fresh, prepared to order turkey Rueben and a Cuban sandwich.  Hot and so tasty.  Delightful waiter Tom and even met the owner/chef who was so friendly.  We both also had a cup of Smoked Chicken Chowder which was excellent!  Hidden gem, Will return!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, family of 6 from Chicago came and were  VERY pleasantly surprised. Each one of us got different meals and tried a bit of each other's, burgers are fantastic, pork chop is stellar, crab cakes are amazing, prime rib is unreal. Definitely come to this place, it's an average of $12-$14 a plate, but the portions are large enough and definitely 10/10 quality."}
{"text":"Our 1'st visit was in June 2017 and we've been back numerous times since.  I have enjoyed their food each time, however, I was a bit disappointed in their Reuben sandwich.  Never before have I ever had a Reuben in which the corned beef was cut into small pieces as opposed to slices of corned beef.  I now know not to ever order that again.  Other than that \"hiccup\",  I've been satisfied with my food (typically salads) and service."}
{"text":"Lunch here was fabulous! I ordered a classic Reuben and my friend ordered a salad. Everything was so incredibly fresh!! One of the best Reuben's I've ever had! The salad had amazingly fresh strawberries and veggies and the grilled chicken on top was cooked perfectly! The establishment does not have a freezer so everything is made daily!! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a family owned restaurant with great food and amazing staff. It's definitely a great spot for food if you find yourself in Monroe. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This little restaurant in Monroe has become one of my favorites! It's a very quaint place, and it's hardily ever crowded. Their prices are reasonable and inexpensive. Their fries are delicious and their burgers a favorite with my family. If you go on a good weather day, the courtyard seating is beautiful and intimate for a date or a more private family meal. The wait staff here are always pleasant and helpful.  If you go here and love it, it becomes a prized secret in a way, because the beauty of the lack of crowd here is cherished by its loyal customers"}
{"text":"This place is truly a \"hidden gem\". The food is top notch and the service is awesome! My family and I have been in several times and not one time have we been disappointed. Do yourself a favor, go to FCG. It worth the drive!"}
{"text":"So glad I have found a restaurant with a patio and WONDERFUL food in Monroe.  Everything was so fresh and homemade.  I had the buffalo chicken mac-n-cheese and it was so good I will definitely be back.  Maybe my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't tried Franklin Court Grille sooner. A great variety of sandwiches, burgers, salads and pizzas. Very laid back atmosphere but service was friendly and prompt. There's a soup of the day that's offered by the cup (complimentary). Today's feature was sausage, sweet potato and greens. It was simply delicious. I ordered a salmon cake with sriracha sauce. Very dense with salmon - not just breading. It was fantastic. My husband ordered a Philly cheesesteak. It was loaded with tender steak, peppers and onions. Not to mention the bread was amazing. Can't believe we saved room for dessert - chocolate peanut butter pie - but so glad we did! We will definitely return soon and cannot wait to try more of their selections!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad there's a restaurant in this location. I'm also glad the food is actually good. It's hard to find a restaurant in Monroe that has a menu with truly good quality food. Everything is typically fried or saturated in grease - very few healthy options. At least Franklin Court Grille has healthy options and the food is always fresh. Their menu even states their food is fresh, never frozen and they don't use microwaves. I hope they stay for a very long time!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers and fries combo I've ever had in my life. Everything is very fresh. I wish I would have taken pictures but my husband and I were so hungry, we attacked our food. The service was excellent too. Michelle, our waitress, is a sweet heart.  My husband had the best of both worlds burger. It had pulled pork and a 4 oz patty. I made my own burger, I added sharp cheddar cheese. It was perfectly cooked, pink in the middle. The fries reminded me of the quality, my grandmother use to make.  Next time I will take photos and post them here.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I ate here two days ago after hearing so many people bragging in the food and service. I went in and was promptly greeted by a waitress and offered me any table I wanted. The menu covered contained almost any sandwich you would want. You can find about any style of food you would want at an American fare restaurant . The special on this Friday visit was fish and chips. I chose a cheeseburger an handcut fries. Unsweetened tea. The burger was delivered in about ten minutes.  It was second to none. I know, usually a burger is just a burger; but, this burger meat was ground fresh in the restaurant a few hours earlier. Hand patted and fantastic. There is no microwave and if the food was any fresher it would still be walking, swimming , or growing. The owner, Bob, came to my table to check on my food and experience . I told him that the bun was a little small for the size and weight, but the food was excellent . About 10 minutes later Bob delivered me another burger on a designer roll. Soooo much better. I complemented him and he said that he would change the rolls, next week. The bill came and he would not charge me for the improved second burger. What an experience . If you're in Monroe, you owe it to yourself and check out the extensive menu. Not too hard to find. It is next door to the Police Department ."}
{"text":"This restaurant has ALL FRESH food ! We had the nachos that were fabulous! The steak sandwich and also the shrimp platter. I can't wait to go back! Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a restaurant in Monroe for a pre-birthday girls outing. A friend suggested Franklin Court grille. I decided to have lunch there prior to the outing. Food and service was great. I told my server my plans and she gave me info to contact the owner which I did. When I arrived this afternoon, a table was reserved for my party. We all enjoyed our lunch and the service was great. Cheryl came out and introduced herself and also gave me a complimentary  slice of peanut butter pie for my birthday. The clam chowder was so good. I will definitely dine at Franklin Court grille again. It was worth the trip to Monroe!!"}
{"text":"This may be my favorite spot to eat at in Monroe. It's located in the downtown area. This small and quaint grill may not seem like the most exciting place from the outside, but what it lacks in appearance it more than makes up with flavor!  They are always running specials on sandwiches and from the many I've tried there is one thing I know-you honestly can't make a wrong decision. If you do, it's your taste buds, not the food. The unique sandwich combinations feature the pairing of the name with an older model classic car.   After being in business for less than a year and a half, this place may still be in the process of gaining followers, but based off the food, it will surely have no problem being a crowd pleaser and a soon to be hometown favorite.  = If you go for lunch, they give complimentary homemade soup, and it may be the best soup you ever do have the pleasure of tasting. Cream of Mushroom was incredible!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here. We sat outside in the courtyard on a pretty day. Service was attentive and timely. Our sandwiches were delicious. I had the Philly cheesesteak with fries. It was really good. My friend had a flounder sandwich I believe. Said it was cooked really well. Great service"}
{"text":"Hidden gem of a restaurant in downtown Monroe with patio seating in a courtyard with a fountain. We had the grilled salmon and prime rib steak dinner specials - I think only served on Saturdays? - and it was delicious. Better tasting and more reasonably priced than fare at trendier restaurants. We will definitely? be coming back!"}
{"text":"We had a great Thanksgiving dinner at Franklin Court yesterday. The meal started with corn chowder soup which was very good. Then came the salad and I had their maple vinegrette dressing which I love. Then the turkey plate was so good. It came with dressing, candied yams, mashed potatoes, green beans, and yeast rolls. It was so good. We were so full that we took our pumkin pie home to eat later. The service was also very good. They make you feel like family."}
{"text":"This place is awesome; the food, the staff and the venue... great place to go. The specials on Saturday evening were exceptional. The prime rib is prepared right and the mashed potatoes are great. The mushroom soup is good too and differently try the loaded nachos ... oh my. Super good food in downtown Monroe. Love it!!"}
{"text":"What a great little spot. We were in town for work and decided on Franklin Court Grille based on the yelp reviews. Great food, great patio and a super friendly staff. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Great downtown Monroe eats with pizza and sandwiches and you can get gluten free crust as well.  OMGURD try the Spinach and Artichoke it's great or totally change over for the meat-a-terian!"}
{"text":"I went here today with a group and although they were pretty much empty, they could not (or would not) sit is all together. Took a while to get our order strated and the server forgot about our other table and they ended up needing to ask to place their orders. The server was great with the kids we had in the group but he forgot a lot of little things we asked for. When it was time to place our order the server reminded us that they do not have a freezer or microwave so they only had 3 burgers left and enough fried for 3 orders. What?! I have never heard of this! I ordered a salad with my meal so the kids could get fries. When my order came it looked good (see pics) but the salad was on the plate with the Philly and I did not like that. Also, the meat in the Philly were big chuncks, not shaved like it should be.   Overall it was decent but I will not go back. I would rather go to a place that I know will not be out of items on their menu at 2 pm."}
