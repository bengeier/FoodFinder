{"text":"This is a reliable Japanese restaurant in uptown Mt. Lebanon. It's kid-friendly, and since we live in Lebo it's convenient. Service is always very friendly. I personally do not like their miso soup but everyone else in my family does. Veggie sushi is very good. They will also do a vegetarian hibachi entree that's not on the menu, but I think the sushi's better."}
{"text":"Service can boost a mediocre meal into the the arena of excellence.  
When the food is consistently above average and the service, friendly and highly personable, and the prices reasonable, then...the meal is sublime.
I gauge a good meal by my level of desire to return.  I will visit Little Tokyo for the level 4 food...and level 5 smile they paint on my face!"}
{"text":"This restaurant gets my vote for best sushi in Pittsburgh! The first date roll is our absolute favorite. The owners and staff are so friendly and welcoming. It's always a great experience dining there. They also have THE best ginger dressing! It's a great place to go with friends, or on a date. It's intimate and inviting, and never disappoints! Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Freshest sushi in Pittsburgh.  The staff is super friendly.  Verrrrryyyyyy good  quail egg w/ salmon roe.  Yum"}
{"text":"The Story
Not bad sashimi place keepin in mind I'm not in CA; however small sushi rolls

The Food
-- Sashimi Regular - 18 pieces of sashimi w/ bowl of rice, miso soup & salad - $19.95
     *   3 pieces pretty thick & 1 large bite of 6 types of fish (yellowtail, halibut, albacore, salmon, maguro, snapper)
    *   a bit pricey but fish was fresh, good size (thick cuts but still easy to eat), and like the types of fish. Instead of egg or octopus appreciate the albacore & halibut

--- Pittsburgh Roll ($5) 
   *   BF thought it was small rolls in terms of diameter but tasty
   *   Pittsburgh Roll had crab & something

-- Shrimp Tempura Roll ($5.50)
   *   BF thought it was small & mediocore 

The Service
Nice waitress but not the most attentive; had difficulty flaggin' down/finding her to get refills or some additional stuff
Overall nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Being from San Francisco, sushi is a way of life. Even my kids will eat sushi over a piece of pizza. Moving to Mt. Lebanon was fraught with challenges but one of the biggest was finding good sushi. Luckily, Little Tokyo fit the bill! No, it's not the premier sushi in the world, but it is good, solid, consistent and very enjoyable. 

The staff are nice. The atmosphere all you could ask in a local sushi shop. 

Thanks for being in Mt. Lebanon Little Tokyo. Might have had to move back to San Francisco otherwise!"}
{"text":"Little Tokyo in the Southside is my absolute favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Always consistently delicious and the service is fantastic. It is set up so the sushi chefs greet you on the way in. The manager/hostess? always is very welcoming and friendly. I haven't gotten anything besides sushi, so I can't speak for other menu items, but the sushi is great. The freshest and tastiest I have ever had. Go. Go now."}
{"text":"first date roll with soy paper is a must  also gotta try the black marlin it melts in your mouth"}
{"text":"If you want fresh sushi/sashimi this is the place to go.. The owners hand select their fish on a regular basis only receiving the best quality throughout the world. This place has an extremely high turn over rate ensuring that the fish you are eating is some of the same quality you would find in most NYC Restaurants without the NYC price tag.. FYI- make sure you try the ginger dressing and the spicy tuna, you will be back again and again...Thanks for a great experience....and yes they do have low sodium soy sauce."}
{"text":"I am a 10-year devoted and loyal Little Tokyo customer.  This is my absolute favorite sushi restaurant in Pittsburgh, and it shaped my love for Japanese food.  The fish is fresh and delicious, and the prices are not inflated.  The staff is always friendly, and the owner is there every night with a smile (he even paid my parking ticket once when I forgot to pay the meter while waiting on a take-out order). The focus isn't on \"fluffy\" sushi with tons of cream cheese and mayo based fillings or sauces, it is genuinely good quality food.  I've been going to Little Tokyo for 10 years now and have never had a single problem or complaint."}
{"text":"Gak. Sushi starts with RICE. Flavorful, interesting, slightly sweet, slightly vinegary rice. Warm rice, loosely packed so it dissolves in your mouth. At Little Tokyo, you get cold flavorless rice clumped into a solid mass of blah.

Also, what is the point of a sushi bar if you aren't interacting with the sushi chef? Why give your order to a waitress who then trots over to a computer terminal and types in your request, only to have it  show up on a print-out two feet away from where you sit?

If you have enjoyed Little Tokyo, you owe it to yourself to try a REAL sushi bar.

Oh, I forgot to rant about the crappy syrup substance used on the eel. Yuck."}
{"text":"Good experience, will def. come back if I'm in town for work again!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Little Tokyo ever since I moved to Pittsburgh about 3 years ago. The food is good and the service is usually fine, but tonight was different. The waitress was either new or had a hearing disability due to not understanding things said to her. She was very nice and attentive but didn't understand when I asked for packets of sugar. I know they have them, I've used sugar packets when I dined there before. Her misunderstanding wasn't that big a deal since she fixed whatever she messed up (like bringing the wrong kind of fish).

What really bothered me was the owner staring at me! I have no idea why he was staring at me but it made me so uncomfortable. For about 20 minutes he just kept watching everything I did! He didn't watch my boyfriend, just me. He came over at the end of the meal in what seemed like an attempt to rush us out of the restaurant. I checked the time, we were only there for about one hour (at dinner time) and we ordered nearly $100 worth of food. Its not like we were just hanging out taking up a table without paying. It made me so uncomfortable, I don't know if I ever want to eat there again."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh. I love the tuna tar tar, dragon roll & spicy scallop hand roll.
The service is amazing,  the staff are very attentive."}
{"text":"I've live in PGH for two years now and this place has the freshest sushi around! Try the Black Marlin when you go there, it is a buttery white fish. Delicious!! The staff is always attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Let's face it,  this is not Japanese food. The food is ok but it is really more or less Chinese food. The soups taste Chinese and lack the umami quality because they are not hon-dashi based. The rice used for the sushi is totally incorrect long grain rice, and not properly vinegared."}
{"text":"Second best sushi in Pittsburgh after Umi. Great uni and eel. Would recommend the sushi and sashimi over other dishes here."}
{"text":"Sunday night dinner turned Sunday Night Delight! 
We started the meal with Spicy Salmon Tartar. We originally order Spicy Tuna Tartar but they were out of tuna and our waitress suggested the salmon version. It was quite good even though tuna would have had an edge for me as far as my preferences. I had the Nabeyaki Udon and was pleased but I don't think I would order it again. It was just not for me. My boyfriend really liked it. But a bit too leek-y/scallion-y and I just didn't care for the kamaboko. My boyfriend had the Little Conqueror and was really happy. 
GREAT service, lovely atmosphere and super food....will be revisiting!"}
{"text":"Great service, nice prices, stylish atmosphere and excellent sushi. The discovery roll is fantastic!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered take out on a Saturday Night as our first experience with this place.  I really wanted sushi as I had just had a baby and it had been a LONG time since I got that craving met.  We were told it would be a half hour before it would be ready but that was fine because we had to drive to pick up anyway.  Upon arriving at the door, I could see that the place was hopping, all tables full and plenty of couples waiting to be seated.  The staff was fast, directing me over the the sushi bar where I checked out immeadiately.  As I was walking out the door I overheard the staff asking those waiting for tables if they would like to order a drink, which I thought was a nice touch.

We ordered 6 different rolls. (The David, The First Date, The Pittsburgh, The American Dream, The Spicy Tuna and a Shrimp Tempura roll.)  The rolls were all placed into 2 containers and none of them were labeled.  But it really didn't matter because we loved it all!  

Based on the price of the various rolls, I'm guessing that the David and the First Date were the ones we really liked the best!  We also got a large ginger dressing to go, as we had salads at home to eat, and it was also excellant!  We highly suggest that if you like ginger dressing, get this for your house as I have tried several different bottled brands in the grocery store and none have that distinct quality that is found in a ginger dressing from a hibachi place.Our total bill with tax was $66, but we really did get a lot of food."}
{"text":"This is my best friends favorite place, so I decided to finally try.  It was ok.  Just ok.  I just moved from Asia Pacific and admit I was spoiled when it comes to sushi and Asian food, however, was excited to see what looked at first glance to be authentic Japanese food.  It was ok.  I will say it is the best I've found here so far at least.  I probably won't return, but I think I wood be a good  neighborhood dining options for others. And, it is, what I thought was pricey for Pittsburgh. My guess is their average check is around $65/person with a glass of wine or sake."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Sushi in Pittsburgh.    The food is all amazing, very fresh and authentic,  and I still compare most places I have been to Little Tokyo.  Other than that, I don't have much to say because this restaurant really speaks for itself.  

What you wont find here:  A trendy atmosphere like Nakama ( I picked Nakama because it is also so popular in PGH), but the sushi MORE than makes up for it."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for the evening. A group was sat without the reservation ahead of us. We were 10 minutes early....and were unfortunately ignored at the door from the time we walked in. No buzzer for you. Afrer 15 minutes we asked how much longer and were told two minutes. Another 15 minutes went bye and we were still standing without a buzzer while others were sat. No apologies or consideration was given. We have given them years of business and was always underwhelmed with the service. The sushi is mediocre but had previously been the only sushi bar in the South Hills. This is no loner the case. I would implore you to try elae where. Jade Grill a block away, completely new, and goes out of their way for you. Next time try some where else. 0 out of 5 if I could"}
{"text":"I have visited Little Tokyo three times and each time has been wonderful. The service,  friendly staff, atmosphere, and sushi make it my go-to place for a relaxing evening. 
The only suggestion I have is to include explanations of each sushi roll for the customer, to make it less confusing for the customer and easier for the server!"}
{"text":"Chopsticks down the best sushi in the burgh.  Consistently good."}
{"text":"Little Tokyo is simply the best fish in the city.  We've tried all the competitors, but keep coming back here."}
{"text":"Finding great Sushi in Pittsburgh is like trying to hunt moose in Schenley Park.  But, Little Tokyo is the place to go if you want quality sushi in Pittsburgh.

Do yourself a favor and order the Discovery Roll.  Jalapeno on the top makes it a staple for me there.

The warm towel is a nice touch and I really appreciate it!"}
{"text":"I didn't have the sushi but the udon noodle soup was definitely not Japanese. It was like a regular Chinese soup with udon dumped in it.  The udon itself was good but the soup was too salty and over peppered. I couldn't even finish it."}
{"text":"Some of the freshest sushi in Pittsburgh. Lots of creative combinations, and everything looks as good as it tastes. 

Sometimes the hibachi can leave a little to be desired, but every other item on the menu is fantastic. You won't get Tuna tartar or gyoza like this anywhere else in Pittsburgh. 

The servers are very friendly and attentive. The owner is always there, which is a sure- fire sign of a good restaurant. He is very loyal to customers to boot."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. The sushi is always fresh, nicely composed, and of good quality. I always judge a sushi place on their plain tuna maki. Here it is always nice and soft, red, and clean tasting. I also enjoy some of their more fancy American style rolls. My boyfriend always order the hibachi, and he really loves it. He never says no when I ask if he wants to go here. Worth paying for!"}
{"text":"Hailing from Seattle and being used to good sushi it makes it very difficult  for me to rate this place. Should I rate this with the same expectations or on a Pittsburgh Seafood bell curve? So, off the boat freshness aside Little Tokyo does a good job of creating the sushi experience as any place in Seattle. The staff is friendly and some waitresses barely understand English.... \"Side of steamed rice, not salad please.\" OK nevermind bring me what you think I need. This may sound mean, but I do not want white people or Mexicans serving up my sushi!

So anyways, been here about four times and have always been sufficiently satisfied. They have a decent selection of nigiri sushi and my wife loves the rolls. I am not a roll person, but I did like the \"First Date\" roll. They also have a good selection of wines to coose from ... not just both types.... red or white. The price is decent for sushi (50-60 for two) so if that is too much I would suggest Giant Eagle Marketplace for budget sushi .... just remember that with budget sushi comes budget digestion."}
{"text":"I guess the place deserves 4 stars.
I liked the atmosphere and service. Food not so much. Its not bad, but not great. But again you cannot make everyone happy;))"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I'm not a sushi fan, so I have 2 words for the non-sushi eater: Hibachi chicken! Dip it in that yummy shrimp sauce!"}
{"text":"I would eat here everyday if I could. The food is excellent. The staff is above and beyond friendly. It is a great location for me as well."}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had in Pittsburgh. Not fancy or anything but their sushi is fresh and tastes good. That's all that really matters to me when it comes to sushi. Service is ok and it can take some time to get your food."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre at best. I was a one person party, so I sat at the sushi bar which was actually very interesting - watching the sushi makers prepare all the different sushi orders. 
I ordered the first date roll. Overall, a good mix of spicy and not. The ingredients tasted fresh. 
I might go back if I'm in the area, but nothing to go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Excellent Sushi, even though we are not in Japan (sarcasm for all the douche bags). It is kick butt no matter what you compare it to."}
{"text":"This place is amazingly delicious and always packed. Best sushi in the area. Love sitting at the sushi bar and watching them make it. They also have a full menu and delicious drinks. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"It was kind of an amateur hour move to try this place on Valentines Day, but for a restaurant that is clearly already very popular on an average night that was then swamped on a \"holiday\", Little Tokyo provided pretty excellent service and served up some incredible rolls and sashimi.  The wait between our miso soups and seaweed salads and the sinfully melt in your mouthy eel appetizer was a little too long, but luckily I'm just that entertaining that it flew by, and the presentation and freshness of all the fish was worth the wait.  It was perfect, and the waitress convinced me to try the sea urchin next time, so I will.  I have a feeling it's an even more lovely place to dine when it's not packed to the gills with goofy dates like mine.  If I find myself craving sushi in Mt. Wash, this is for sure where I'll head."}
{"text":"After graduating from college in Cleveland, one of the restaurants I was most excited to head to again was Little Tokyo. This is my go-to sushi stop in Mt. Lebanon.

The sushi and rolls are amazing, from the Shrimp Tempura roll (a personal favorite) to the First Date roll. If one is not in the mood for sushi, the hibachi options are great too. The shrimp sauce on top of the white rice and hibachi chicken is a huge reason why I choose Little Tokyo as a lunch or dinner destination. 

The atmosphere is cool, the service is always great and attentive and the prices are fair for the food and service. This is a great place to head out for a girls night, date night or family night. Pretty much any kind of night will be a success at Little Tokyo."}
{"text":"FILET MIGNON NOT AS ADVERTISED

We ordered the filet mignon with chicken hibachi.  The flavor was ok, we asked for the filet to be medium and it arrived well done, was very chewy and we suspect a chuck roast or some other inferior cut of beef was substituted for the filet.  False advertising at its best--shouldn't that be illegal?

The fried rice that came with it was ok but we were not offered a choice of steamed rice or noodles.  Other hibachi places we have been to plate noodles and steamed or fried rice together.

The miso soup was very salty and murky and not very flavorful.  The salad had a lot of water at the bottom of the bowl and was made up of head lettuce only (anyone ever heard of a salad spinner)--not very appetizing.

We also ordered sushi (all cooked ingredients) it was just ok and not the best I have experienced.

The waitress was slow and had to be asked for refills on our hot tea.  The whole meal took almost an hour and a half and cost $75.00 tip included.  Not worth the price, time, gas and wear and tear on the car to get there."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night when the restaurant was completely full with a wait list. We only had to wait about 20 minutes and they were true to their wait prediction. Everything was delicious and came out in a timely manner. We started off with the spicy tuna roll for an appetizer and I got the chicken hibachi for dinner. This place never disappoints. If you like sushi you'll love Little Tokyo."}
{"text":"Walk through the front door and the owner, in a white shirt and tie , will greet you with a smile. Staff service will be excellent. They will treat you like a star. The shushi and all menue items are fabulous. The wine selection can only be called excellent, outstanding. Plenty of parking across the street in a 4-story, enclosed garage. Y
ou will never, never go away hungry....."}
{"text":"Little Tokyo is the Best Sushi Joint in town - hands down.  Great food, great service - from the entire staff to the owner Frank who is the ultimate relationship guy - knows you by name and knows who your freinds and family are and asks you about them - genuine.  Great Place! A1 reccomendation!!!"}
{"text":"Little Tokyo is a great place for sushi.  Everything is fresh, the place is very clean, and the staff is great.

Try the rainbow roll or the first date roll.  I also like the ramen and udon in the winter.

One of my favorite restaurants in the south hills."}
{"text":"Little Tokyo is top of the line by Pittsburgh sushi standards. The fish is very fresh and the specialty rolls are created with skill and precision. Nothing is drowning in disgusting mayo or cream cheese, the defining characteristic of most of the mediocre sushi of Western Pennsylvania. The staff is friendly, service is great, and the warm towels are a very nice touch. I'm really not a fan of the brown-colored miso soup but overall, Little Tokyo stands out for quality. The \"Dean Roll\" in particular is fantastic."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend for the first time who is a regular. The dining atmosphere was welcoming and clean. Service was prompt, greeter and server were very friendly and I was actually in a hurry and it wasn't a problem at all. The quality was great. Only wish they had brown rice as an option for sushi. Would 100% come back again!! So excited for my next visit :) I got the spicy tuna hand roll and seaweed salad. It was amazing. Better than sushi too or beni chopsticks."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi in town! Plus they are nice enough to let us separate the bills (and fulfill all our picky request)"}
{"text":"Little Tokyo is the restaurant where I first experienced sushi, so it will always have a spot in my heart.  However, after gaining a little more knowledge of sushi, I still believe Little Tokyo is one of the best.  For one, I have still not seen daikon rolls on a menu in Ohio, and they are one of my favorites.  Little Tokyo's avocado and kappa rolls are also excellent.  My favorite appetizer is the agedashi tofu, though the others are good as well.  The atmosphere is great for everything from a casual lunch to a pre-Homecoming dinner.  The service is attentive, providing you with hot towels to clean your hands before dinner.  They will validate your garage parking for one hour, and the mints in a jar at the cash register are delicious.

I would highly recommend Little Tokyo, especially over Sushi Two (or Three, I never can remember) on Beverly Road."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely great in this place. But the service is totally terrible! Wait for 40 minuets for a table because the front desk server was keeping lying to me! Even with my waiting device blinking, she is still lying to me that I am not the next customer. The way she behave is like she is a RACIST!!! I guess I am a Chinese I deserve to wait and wait :)"}
{"text":"This was the strangest sushi experience I've ever had.  My friend and I just wanted sushi and a side of fried noodles. The sushi menu (aka a piece of paper) had no pictures or descriptions of the sushi. How are you supposed to know what a \"David roll\" is?  Basically, we had to listen to all of her explanations before we chose one. I asked for a side of fried noodles and she said they didn't do that there. Weird, I thought. So, my friend and I were going to split a main course - Hibachi chicken. We had forgotten to say that we wanted noodles instead of rice.  When we told her, she just repeated again that they don't \"do that\" there. THEN, she says we have a dinner portion of noodles - but no small portions... What? 
The service was less than good, but the food was delicious, so there's that. You might want to go when you're not really hungry because you'll probably have a bunch of questions about the sushi. And our waitress disappeared for many minutes at a time..."}
{"text":"I did not have a good experience here tonight. We did not make reservations and got seated within 10 minutes! We were happy about that but.. Waiting for our food took so long! We were ready to walk out and just cancel the order because of the wait.. But ended up waiting it out. 
The food turned out okay. 

Miso soup- needed scallions and seaweed
Salad- the dressing wasn't gingerly enough and tasted like Italian dressing. 
- the agedashi tofu was not agedashi tofu.. It was fried tofu in soy sauce with red pickled Chinese chilli. Ugh.. So disappointed. 
- sushi was okay. It was just average for me. 
 
They were definitely quick with the check and cleaning at the end! 
Overall, didn't have a good experience and food was salty for my taste. :/"}
{"text":"Great little sushi spot in Mt. Lebanon. The nigiri, sashimi, and maki are all excellent.  The freshness and options of the fish are hard to beat else where. The staff are friendly and attentive, I get the vibe this is family owned and operated. The decor and atmosphere are nice, clean and inviting. As I said before, this place is hard to beat. Try the first date roll (even if you're by yourself)."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while and could not believe how good the sushi delux dinner was. As good as it has ever been over the years. I think Little Tokyo has been overshadowed recently by competing area Resturant's and it's time to recognize them for the quality food they consistently put out. Please give this local place some love!"}
{"text":"Coming from the west coast, this is probably the worst sushi I have had in a very long time. There are no descriptions for any of the rolls. They do not offer low sodium soy sauce. The wait for 3 rolls and 4 pieces of sashimi took over 25 minutes. Now for the food, the scallop roll is mushy ( if they were scallops I wouldn't know). Actually, everything I ate was mushy. The service was inattentive. I waited 10 minutes for a refill for my iced tea, after the owner and another server looked straight at my empty glass."}
{"text":"It's so good here. However, as I have a seafood allergy that are not prepared for this. We had to argue for them to cook the food separately. And they did not want to do it. The food is always good, but it's not for someone with an allergy to go to!"}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant in the South Hills by far and probably all of Pittsburgh! Authentic sushi and not overly expensive, unlike the \"americanized\" sushi you get at places like Nakama that is deep fried and covered in sauce. The First Date roll is my absolute favorite! And if you order atleast 2 rolls they include a ginger salad for free. Great spot!"}
{"text":"I haven't always been thrilled by this place, but our last meal was fantastic. The quality and freshness of the tuna and yellow tail that we had from the sushi bar was as good as I've had anywhere. The service was also engaging and timely. Well done Little Tokyo!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had in ages! Beats Nakama and Saga! Also the Sansai Udon Bowl was amazing! The noodle texture was dead on! Everyone at the table was trying them!"}
{"text":"This place is the bee's knees, people. I have been eating here for years, and I have yet to be disappointed with my experience. The staff is ALWAYS so friendly, the owner is always around and smiling, and the food is fantastic. My go to is the filet hibachi and the first date roll (although all rolls I've had have been amazing). The steak is seriously always SO FREAKING GOOD, and the sushi is always fresh. My father in law is obsessed with the miso salmon, but I can never steer from my usual. 

It does tend to get busy, so you may be there for a little longer but it is worth it. I personally think it's part of the experience. They also have a small beer, wine, and liquor selection, and of course sake. Just do yourselves a favor, and get there ASAP."}
{"text":"Great sushi bar. The staff and owner are extremely attentive. Great presentation. Decent price too. And I got to sit next to Mario Lemeuix at lunch a couple weeks ago!"}
{"text":"I primarily had sashimi and it was excellent.  the fish was very high quality, fresh, and well-handled.  We ordered a spicy tuna roll toward the end of the meal, and I had to take a star off the whole experience for that roll - it had a pile of the fishiest, cheapest, rankest caviar on top.  I couldn't eat it.  Service was lovely and ambiance great.  I'll be back but will be sure to request \"no caviar\" on anything!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to get sushi as we were on a double date. We had a very good experience here.

We were seated right away and our server was very nice. She brought us all waters. I didn't really enjoy the beer selection. They also didn't have a very wide selection of wines. I ended up with a  riesling. 

The food was exceptional. We order shrimp balls and tuna tartar. They were very good. They were small, and really only could feed two people and we had four people.

Everyone got the sushi deluxe but me and they all loved it. My boyfriend and I got the tuna belly and black Marlon and we really liked those rolls. 
I ordered the Dean roll because it was made from soy bean wrap. It was really different but so good. 
  I also got the discovery roll I think. It had shrimp tempora and jalapeños on it too. It was very good and came with 8 pieces. We all decided miso soup and salad. The soup was full and not just broth. The salad was small and the dressing was alright!

Overall, the restaurant was great and super yummy and we will return !"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the Burgh!  Little Tokyo's fish is always fresh and rolls+sashimi are made-to-order.  Their appetizers and hibachi are also very good.  They have a limited selection of beer and wine, including Japanese fare.  The owner, Frank is also very nice and you'll probably see him walking around checking on tables, making sure you are well accommodated.  Not trendy like Nakama, which in my opinion, is a little overrated.  Can be packed on weekend nights, make sure to show up early to get your name on the list, I'm pretty sure they'll take reservations for larger parties.  This is the first place I ever tried sushi and I measure every other place against it, regardless of where I might be!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi.  Enjoyed all of it.  Great salad and soup as well.  Make reservations, esp on a weekend.  The only thing we DIDN'T like was the continual (loud) birthday celebrations."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi place for Pittsburgh - best I've found yet.  (Please don't expect West Coast sushi - I did qualify my statement by saying \"for Pittsburgh\".  I usually have to do this for Pittsburgh restaurants.)  Sushi was a little loosely prepared, but the fish seemed very fresh, and the presentation was nice.  

The service was excellent, too.  Our waitress was very friendly, fast, and helpful."}
{"text":"Good sushi, good service, nice atmosphere, nothing too superlative to say here. Some friends of mine rave about this place, but to me it's on the good end of average. I've never had a bad experience, so that's something. Try the unagi."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Pittsburgh, hands down. 

Their fish is always fresh, colorful, and full of flavor. I've been here countless times and cannot recall one subpar meal. Service is always fantastic, and I must give them props because I had a party of 20 for my birthday and they handled it seamlessly. 

Get the fried ice cream, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Little Tokyo is still the freshest Japanese place! Had my usual CA Roll so delish! I wish it was a bigger place to invite my friends to my birthday lunch! Please open a part 2 bigger rooms! Yummo!"}
{"text":"Good food. Excellent service. The food took about 20min to get to our table. Parking was tricky but I did like the location. They have tons of other restaurants and dessert places (cakes at Alladin) around them. I had the twister, dragon, and the yummy rolls. The soy sauce was extremely salty, so I mixed with teriyaki, which was perfect. The waitress did offer a low sodium option. Overall we had a good time."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi in Pittsburgh. Everything was really fresh and light which sushi should be, but this just seemed better. Hard to find a soft shell crab roll that the tempura is done well. This place does."}
{"text":"Great local spot and the food is always delicious. The sushi is top notch (and the real reason to go) but there are hibachi and noodle options available for those who are not into the whole raw fish thing. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place was alright. We went for a birthday dinner, birthday girls pick. We can't justify the price as being that worth it. I rather go to an actual hibachi place. We both ordered the steak and shrimp and both our orders didn't come with our shrimp. They then brought out shrimp for us, but it was only enough portion for one plate. We were upset by this. The sushi was very good and quick to come out. The service was slow overall though. They were not attentive for drinks at all. We sat at a table that was behind the wall of the bar. There was cough syrup tucked behind the alcohol bottles. I found this odd. The food overall did taste good, service was iffy, and atmosphere was casual and nice. We won't be back, but it was nice to try."}
{"text":"I've dined here thrice now, sushi on every visit, so that's the only thing I can review, other than atmosphere and service, and it's all good. The sushi is treated with care and respect, and arrives to you in manageable mouthfuls. Fresh, fresh, fresh, and beautifully prepared. The miso soup and salad are also very good. I am greeted each time immediately upon opening the front door with a smile and seated promptly. Sometimes the servers get busy, but they watch each other's tables, so you shouldn't go long without some attention here. I think this is the best sushi in the South Hills, and I've not had better in Pittsburgh, though I've left some places untried yet. Delightful."}
{"text":"I'm new to Pittsburgh and recently my girlfriend came into town to visit.  We decided we had a taste for sushi and looked up a few places.  On a Saturday night, it was tough to find a nice sushi place that wasn't booked for the rest of the night or very busy.  We finally decided on this one after calling many others that were too busy...I'm so glad we went here.  The sushi was very good (it wasn't swimming 10 minutes ago, but for a land-locked city it was damn good), the ambiance was nice (decorations weren't tacky, music wasn't blaring, TV wasn't enormous), and the service was -- in a word -- awesome.  I've had my fair share of fine dining and five star service but our waitress here was better (in kind, not degree).  We were all laughing and talking, she taught us a few things about Japanese culture, and still seamlessly waited on our table; she was just so personable.  She got the largest (percentage) tip I've ever left and she deserved every cent.  She really made the experience special for us.  I would not give a second's hesitation to going back to Little Tokyo."}
{"text":"Some of the highest quality sushi you'll find and a great atmosphere for, yes, a hefty price but that's the point of sushi -- a celebratory food you have maybe once or twice a year."}
{"text":"I come here kind of often. Always have good service, the sushi is very good and the pricing is very reasonable considering the quality of sushi. The inside is nice too. The only reason it isn't my number one place for sushi, is because Umi in shady side is orgasmic....ONLY reason this place is my number 2. Whatever the case, I HIGHLY recommend little Tokyo for good sushi."}
{"text":"This is not Japanese food, period. Run by by Chinese folks serving glorified Chinese food."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in Pittsburgh. The spicy tuna here is a go to either as a roll or on the first date roll. Try a roll or the spicy tuna tar tar!"}
{"text":"Little Tokyo is a gem in Mount Lebanon!!  We just moved back to Pittsburgh area after living in California for 4 years and this place is our sushi fix. The staff here are so friendly and welcoming. The restaurant is clean and well situated. 

Most importantly the quality of the ingredients are top notch.  The yellow tail, tuna and salmon are delicious. The portions are perfect. The fish is nicely sliced and rice is sticky enough to hold its shape when picked up with the chopsticks. I like this attention to detail. The fish is fantastic the rice is a good consistency because you need both pieces of the puzzle in order to get the perfect fit of fish to rice, and from plate to mouth without anything coming apart.  Wonderful."}
{"text":"Love this place. I always get the chicken/beef combo with noodles. The price is reasonable and the food is delicious. I always have leftovers."}
{"text":"Hands down, best sushi in the city.  I think this is both if you are a roll person or if you are a sashimi person - which is not the case everywhere.  Some places make awesome rolls, but that seems to be to hide the not-freshness of the fish.  Others have great fresh fish, but can't make a roll to save their lives.

This place does it all.  J and I went here on a Friday night around 6 and were sat immediately - no wait, but the place was pretty packed.  I started with some hot sake and a green salad.  Their ginger dressing is delish!  I was practically licking the bowl.  I considered asking for more lettuce to soak up the rest of the dressing when our shrimp shumai came.  J and I try to get shrimp shumai everywhere we go as a barometer and this was by far the best.  The wrappings were complete and held in all the very fresh shrimp goodness.  Then came the sushi.  We ordered the First Date roll, the David, the black marlin, the spicy tuna and the spicy scallop.  What can I say, we like sushi.  The black marlin is amazing - mild, fresh, not chewy.  The spicy scallop is not something you see everywhere and definitely a plus here.  However, where they really shine is the spicy tuna.  Everyone does a spicy tuna.  At most places, you can barely taste the tuna in the mayo-based spicy sauce that is slathered all around.  Here the tuna is front and center with spices mixed into the pureed tuna.  No mayo needed to hold it together and all the better for it.  The David and First Date were a bit pricier and also awesome.  One was tempura shrimp with spicy tuna on the outside and the other was more like a rainbow roll.  Both excellent.  

While I do also love me some Katana in Dormont, this place has the best sushi in the city and in a charming location in downtown Mt Lebanon."}
{"text":"I've tried sushi at all of Pittsburgh's sushi offerings and NONE of them can touch Little Tokyo. Every city has a \"best sushi place\" and this is Pittsburgh's. Hands down. I've enjoyed over 20 meals at Little Tokyo and never once have I experienced bad sushi or bad service."}
{"text":"Live like 15 mins away from LT so I come here all the time with my friends. About a month ago, we all went here for dinner on a Wednesday and it was packed! However, the line didn't take long at all and in about 10-15 mins, we were seated! The sushi are always so good and fresh. This is the restaurant where I first tried fried ice cream too! Yum!"}
{"text":"Craving sushi? Then this is the place to go. It's well worth the drive to Mt. Lebanon. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that the fish was flown in multiple times a day.  It's always so fresh. The sushi gets 5 stars.The staff is also incredible. The owner goes out of his way to walk around and check on tables. It is very clear that he wants every guest to have an enjoyable dining experience. However, if you are looking for great hibachi, look elsewhere. I've tried the hibachi chicken, steak and shrimp. I've never been that impressed. It's fairly standard for hibachi. I've definitely had better fried rice and miso soup. The hibachi gets 3 stars. Another issue when eating at Little Tokyo is getting a table. It seems like business is hit or miss.Some nights I have tried to get a table for 3 and had to wait 40 minutes. Last weekend, we were able to get a table for 6 without waiting. I suggest you call ahead if you have a large party."}
{"text":"We have been ordering food from Little Tokyo for almost 5 years now. Up until the last year or so I would have have rated them a 4 out of 5 on the yelp scale. 
Over the last 6 months I have to report they have lost their edge. Their Maki Rolls have consistently been \"sloppy\" and recently we had bones left in our eel roll. They have also removed the combo deluxe that we always enjoyed. 
We order here at least twice a month and I am sorry to write that we may be looking for a new sushi place."}
{"text":"As sushi goes-very good. We had five rolls- Spicy Tuna, Rock and Roll, Yellow Tail, First Date, and the Dragon Roll. They were all delicious. The ambiance was pretty good and the service wasn't too bad-a little slow to start out with. The ginger salad was just odd. My husband and I couldn't quite put our finger on it but it was just odd. The miso soup didn't have any seaweed in it at all. I'm not saying it was understated, I'm saying there was absolutely nothing green in there and it was very salty. 

Since we went there for sushi and the sushi was great we can't really complain."}
{"text":"Wonderful sushi and decent pricing. One of my favorite places to go! The ambiance is very nice and the food is absolutely fantastic. I'd love to go again!"}
{"text":"Great service! Way yummy food! These folks do sushi right! It's fresh and crazy flavorful. They have a decent selection of adult beverages too. It was fun for my sons birthday and I'll be back for date night."}
{"text":"I recently started working in Mt. Lebanon and a few co-workers and I ordered take-out.  A few ordered sushi (very good) and I had the chicken hibachi.  Very good helpings of chicken, veggies, rice and a salad.  Also came with ginger dressing and two sauces for the meal.  Next time, I will dine
 in the restaurant but was so impressed with their take-out."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday with reservations.  The place was really crowded, but they had our table ready immediately. Wine list was good. We tried a bunch of different sushi, all of which was very enjoyable. Soups and seaweed salad was good. And they even made a special chicken and rice meal for my daughter. Pretty good, but slightly pricey. Not the best sushi in pittsburgh, but still very good."}
{"text":"The sushi here was great! 

The hibachi not so much - We got the hibachi chicken which came with the fried rice / miso soup and green salad. Besides the green salad and the awesome ginger sauce - the chicken was okay and the miso soup .. not so good.

We also got the david roll , eel roll, california roll and the nigiri salmon - They were all really good.

The service was good.

Will definitely go back again but only for the sushi and the sashimi"}
{"text":"All righty!!! I have eaten sushi in Boston, NYC, Portland ME, Phily, Chicago, San Diego to name a few. This place is the best ever and I have never been disappointed. Located In Mt. Lebanon, a cool little suburb of Pittsburgh, This resturant does not mess around. 

The owner pays top dollar for all of his seafood and the chefs there are top notch. In the back of the resturant is a Japanese kitchen where you can order then watch 1 woman cook your food. 

Great spot for a date!! And Best Sushi this side of the missisip!!"}
{"text":"The best SUSHI in Pittsburgh! I've eaten sushi all over town, and there are other good places. But nothing has the consistent quality of preparation, freshness, and taste of LT......You want sushi, go to Little Tokyo in Mt. Lebanon."}
{"text":"This was not our first time trying this restaurant but we like it so we keep coming back. We came here on Friday night during dinner. The restaurant itself is decorated nicely. What I like about it is that it's not too dark like the other restaurants, it also looks family owned. When you first sit, they give you hot steamed towels to clean your hands which I thought was pretty neat!

We ordered a maki roll of shrimp tempura, regular platter of sashimi and a bowl of chicken udon. The food came within a reasonable amount of time and the sushi came with a salad. The platter also came with soup and salad. The soups and salads came out first and were delicious!  The reason why I'm giving it a 4 star instead of 5 is because I was disappointed in the shrimp tempura roll. It was the smallest shrimp tempura roll that I've ever seen! It only had the shrimp. For the numerous times that I had this at other locations, there was always something with it such as cucumber/ lettuce/crab. This was just rice, seaweed and shrimp. It was not worth it for me since I've had pretty good shrimp tempura rolls. The sashimi was good. It came in a plate with 15 pieces of fish and a small bowl of rice. I also enjoyed the chicken udon. Another small downside is that they do not accept Discover.

Overall,  it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi! The nigiri was absolutely delicious, had the salmon, toro, and sweet shrimp and they were all utterly delicious. Super fresh, firm fish were used. The quality was just superb. Excellent value!!"}
{"text":"The best sushi in Pittsburgh, without question.  This little gem is nestled in the heart of Mt. Lebanon.  My husband was raised in MtL and has been eating at this place for as long as he can remember.  He introduced me to it when we were dating and it has become our go-to place. 

We've learned the hard way that sushi in Pittsburgh is best served HERE.  The fish is flavorful and bright and the sushi is artfully crafted.  I've sampled a few non-sushi dishes, but stick with the raw stuff because, well, it's pure heaven.  We have our favorites - black marlin and yellow tail sashimi, eel nigiri and the spicy tuna and philly (fresh salmon, only!) rolls.  We just discovered the spicy scallop in seaweed and it is to die for.  

We went through a phase during which we celebrated milestones (birthdays, promotions, etc) at different \"hot spots\" around the city and were always left a bit disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, we certainly eat elsewhere, but our celebratory dinners are always with Frank, et al @ LT. 

Now, I'm not wearing blinders and certainly recognize that the place on Ellsworth in SHY is higher end and offers a more elegant experience, but the quality of the fish really isn't that different... not to mention, who splurges for that on a regular basis?  

Look no further (and skip the craziness and mediocrity of Nakama) and go to LT.  Just don't take our spot at the sushi bar!"}
{"text":"Hands down favorite sushi spot in Pittsburgh AND its right down the street from me. I've searched and tried other sushi restaurants around the area to see if there was anything better but nowhere else in my book compares. I won't go anywhere else now haha."}
{"text":"Just arrived into town & had a taste for sushi! Remembered this place's reviews & after hitting a curb, damaging the hubcap of my rental I finally made it in! I ordered my sushi usual: ginger salad, spicy tuna & sushimi Ika. The ginger salad was good, but not great...I am spoiled when it comes to ginger dressing & this was not my favorite ginger dressing. The spicy tuna was fabulous! I got 3 pieces of Ika. They were good, but not the freshest I have had. My major complaint is that I asked for a side of sirachi & instead got just a hot oil...hmmmm..."}
{"text":"Great little sushi place in Mount Lebabnon. While the sushi here is fabulous, everything else on the menu is not. If you are craving sushi and are in the area, Little Tokyo hits the spot every single time. The owner is extremely generous and an all around great guy."}
{"text":"Sarku clone but a good one. For $6 bucks you get your entre cooked to order in minutes with steamed veggies. For $2 you can get extra meat and feed two."}
{"text":"One of our favorites.  Amazing food and amazing staff.  Never disappoints!  The management is kind and sweet, a pleasure to support such wonderful people."}
{"text":"I like this place, decently priced and good food. The only thing I don't like is how crowd it gets sometimes but it's expected since their food is spot on. Anyways, good little place to get your teriyaki chicken"}
{"text":"Very good food, very clean and priced fairly. Our second visit was amazing! Our server was very attentive even though they had a full house. The food is very good and priced reasonably. Looking forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"My definite favorite place in Pittsburgh for sushi. It's the freshest you will find. They sell live scallops which is a true treat. They open them up right out of the shell and they are so sweet, just squeeze lemon on them. Don't ruin them by dipping it in soy. Frank is very hands on. He's always there and talks to his patrons as he walks around. You won't be disappointed. Take it from me. I've been going there for about 15 years now. I went before he even had a liquor license."}
{"text":"I'm somewhat of a sushi snob.  I'll admit it. But I have lived in Tokyo and only want good sushi. And as far as sushi in the Burgh goes, Little Tokyo on Washington Road has the best! 

I've never had bad sushi there. I always love yellow tail and tuna and will choose a few types of rolls as well. I'm a fan of spicy tuna and anything that has tempura mixed in it. (I do enjoy the texture of the tempura in a roll.). Last night was no exception. I believe we had the Anniversary Roll which was a tempura roll with tuna in top! A winning choice. 

I will say the Yasai Tempura is just ok but not a ton of flavor. But miso is a good way to start out the meal. 

Another thing that I do enjoy is how they give you hot towels beforehand. (I wish every restaurant did that!) 

Overall, you can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"I will get right to the point, my wife and i went for lunch today, we each had a sushi roll. Then she got the hibachi shrimp, and I got the hibachi chicken. The sushi tasted like the fish had been frozen and was not fresh.. I said a prayer before I ate it asking God to not make me sick. Then the hibachi, the vegetables were Rae and way undercooked, the rice had no flavor, and the chicken was bland... the best part is, they have a small part of the kitchen behind the seating, and I think our waitress is the one who cooked our meals. For 40 bucks, I will not be returning. If I want good sushi I will go to the slippery mermaid in sewickley and if I want good hibachi I will go to make me. Just figured we would give this place a shot since we were in the area."}
{"text":"Lunch here today was excellent. My friends and I tried 5 different sushi rolls, and they were all tasty and extremely flavorful. Although I didn't particularly care for the texture of the eel roll (probably because I'm not a big fan of eel..), it was my friend's favorite. We also had a perfectly cooked shrimp tempura roll, and a deliciously prepared dragon roll with avocado on top. Paired with a glass of Pinot Grigio, lunch was overall fantastic. Just be aware of their hours, as they close at 2:30 to prepare for their dinner service."}
{"text":"Was at my boyfriends and had a hankering for some good sushi! So he suggested this place since he tried there other location on E. Carson Street on Pittsburgh South Side.
Let me tell you I was not disappointed! It was just what my craving was asking for!
The place is a decent size but we got seated right at the end of the sushi bar where we could see all the action being taken place. 
We got to see the \"sushi masters\" assemble a boat of sushi which looked delicious along with all the other rolls they were slinging out.
First up I got some Miso soup to try which had a lovely deep and rich broth to it. Next we got shrimp balls as an appetizer that came out nice, hot, and fresh with a luscious dipping sauce along the side. 

For our main course we chose 4 different rolls to try the American Dream, First Date, Rock and Roll, and the Lobster Roll. I won't go into detail on each one since you can check out what's in each of these yummy rolls on there website but my favorite was the First Date. It had tempura shrimp with spicy tuna on top of it! Really happy I got recommended this place and hope to come here again soon!"}
{"text":"This is our go to sushi place. Service is great. The food is good and the prices are fairly standard for sushi. The wait can be long during peak hours but it is working the wait."}
{"text":"Meh. The outside and insides are nice and trendy, and the sushi was pretty good, but my Nabeyaki Udon had a really odd flavor that didn't sit well with me. The place also smelled like fish, and that's never good. I don't know if I'd go back, especially since they're a little pricey. Service was ok though."}
{"text":"I love, LOVE this place.  The sushi at this place is what I use as a basis to compare other sushi.  I had my first taste of sushi at Lil Toks which is why it has become my benchmark.  Now I will say that I have had better sushi at a few places (Umi in Shadyside , PA and Coast in Chicago), but for what your paying at this place you cannot get a better value for the quality.  Those other places that I mention you'll definitely be paying alot more for marginally better sushi - at least in my opinion.  So whenever I'm in the mood for some sushi I come to this place.

I should also mention that they have the most amazing fried ice cream...ever...even better than Chi Chi's fried ice cream (for those who remember).  People it's seriously that good!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They cook it fresh right it front of you and it different then traditional Panda Express."}
{"text":"My favorite spot to eat at when I'm at the Arrowhead Towne Center Mall!

Being Asian of course I love just about anything and everything Asian, so whenever I'm given the chance, I'll pick Little Tokyo every time I can. The food here is delicious and priced right for the amount you get. I can never eat everything they give me, so always end up sharing my food with someone else. 

I normally order their special which is the Chicken Teriyaki combo special for $5.99. I always switch out the rice for the noodles which is an additional $.65, which is more than worth it to me! Their Shrimp Teriyaki combo is also delicious. Their combos come with the meat of choice (chicken, shrimp, beef or a combination of two of those), rice, and veggies. They also offer double the meat for an extra $1.49, fried rice for an extra  $.30 and brown rice for an extra $.50. I haven't tried those items yet, but I'm sure they are good as well. 

This last time I came, I noticed they have Bento Boxes now and gave it a try. Boy am I glad I did! It comes with veggies, meat, rice, 3 chicken dumplings, and 4 sushi pieces. Again, I replaced the rice for the noodles. Everything tasted excellent and cooked perfectly. I love how their veggies are more like steamed and not overly cooked. It still has a crunch to it. This came out to $7.89 + $.65 for the noodles. 

On top of their combos, they offer sides of Veggie rolls, chicken egg rolls, chicken dumplings and fried cream puffs. Can also get fried rice, steamed rice, noodles on the side. Drinks run from $1.49 for a small, $1.69 for a medium and $1.89 for a large. 

The staff here are very friendly and some even try and make conversation with you. The cook is very efficient and gets your food out quickly. Will definitely be back many more times! Love this place :)"}
{"text":"This place is a favorite of my husband and his family. You can't go wrong with the sushi or hibachi. The sushi boat is spectacular. I just wish they'd bring back the Maki Regular Special on the menu. After visiting a few times, the owner (Frank) and the servers (Chi, Danyu, etc.) treat you like family. I'm amazed they remember our names, ask about our family members by name, and follow-up on matters previously discussed."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant fits american taste. Because i was the only non american to eat here just now, even though the seats are fully occupied
It doesnt taste like an actual japanese cuisine, it is very chinese. And i can smell chinese food right after a few second entering the restaurant. The sushi is not even firmly made

I am not saying the food is bad, it is actually alright


But they have a great interior and place"}
{"text":"With prices this cheap,
I expected bland sushi.
But hey, it's Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Folks, this is not sushi....frozen crappy fish with fake colors.  But the most disturbing thing is how expensive it is!  Seriously?  $18 for 5 small pieces of fish and a terrible 6 piece fake color salmon roll, wow!!!  More expensive than top notch sushi lunch in Nyc or San Fran."}
{"text":"We hit Little Tokyo for lunch about once a week.  We love their avocado rolls and hibachi shrimp.  My kids love it too.  Really good food, very reliable nice service, the owner always says \"hi\" and makes sure everyone is happy.  Great place, also great for take-out.
Nice lunch prices too!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the dragon roll and hibachi chicken to go last night, and the hibachi was so good! Their pink sauce is tangy, the rice is cooked well, the veggies are fantastic (love the carrots), and the chicken is wonderful! Their hibachi is a little different than other places, but it's better in my opinion. The dragon roll, though, was just ok. I would be willing to try it again, but I definitely will not be ordering the dragon roll in a take out order."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite sushi restaurant in the Pittsburgh area and it is worth the drive to Mt Lebanon.  The staff were so super friendly at this family run place and provided excellent service. The owners were a nice couple that both stopped by to make sure we were happy, in addition to our very attentive waitress.  My friend and I shared a sushi boat that included maki, sushi and sashimi and all the sushi was very fresh and tasty.  It even included a spider roll as one of the maki, which is unusual when you get a combination where they usually give you smaller/cheaper rolls at most places.  They also had a decent selection of wine and beer which is unusual for a sushi place.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"we have dined here probably 10 times over the years.  It's always a great experience!  I'm talking consistently good EVERY time.  Great sushi choices, excellent hibachi and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I'm not typically a sushi eater but my wife convince me to come here. We had only sushi for dinner and I must say everything we ate was delicious! Great place for Japanese sushi and they also have a hibachi grill."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is high class, and you get what you pay for!  I felt welcomed at the door, and after I was seated I received warm moist towels to wash my hands.  After this, I purchased a sushi roll, miso soup, and agedashi tofu.  All came out promptly and were temperature appropriate.  The fish was texturally satisfying and the miso soup the right blend of salty and umami.  I would highly recommend this place for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in PGH. If not in the mood for sushi the ramen bowl is amazing! Frank is the owner and he is from another time and place. Always remembers your name and maintains a staff who pay attention to detail. Sinatra is usually on the speakers which is uncommon in 2015 and adds to the charm. A must stop and staple of Mt Lebanon."}
{"text":"My familiy has been coming back here for years. The owner is Korean not Japanese but friendly as ever. Have had some bad experiences with some waitresses, but usually they are great. Ambience great as well. My parents always get the sashimi platter. My sisters and I get everything from sushi, tempura udon, and the hibachi grill food. Spider roll wasn't my favorite."}
{"text":"I refuse to eat sushi in southwestern PA because I am disappointed every single time. Little Tokyo on the other hand has won over my heart. Their sushi may not be the best I have ever had but it is definitely has my invisible stamp of approval. The place is a decent size with average decor and nice staff. I would have given this place three stars based on food, service and decor alone but the one chef did something so amazing for me that I added on an extra star. I requested a roll that wasn't on the menu and it took a lot persuading (our waitress) to bring the idea to the chef. Our waitress explained to the chef would I asked for and she said that he will try his best. All I have wanted since moving to this area is a delicious avocado and inari roll. And that is exactly what I got. I no longer worry about sushi in this area."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I frequent this place as often as we can. Best sushi around by far. Lunch prices are awesome but you get their dinner quality of food. Favorites are probably black marlin, soft shell crab roll, yellow fun tuna, anything with eel, just about every entree and their ice cream! Oh man, I'm getting hungry typing this"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked up to the counter one of the men working started pestering me. I'm in sales so I know you have to up sell but he would not take the hint. He kept trying to get me to buy fried rice. I said \"I only want edamame.\" Now I've been here before I know the total of my usual order. $2.19. After I had given my card to the woman when it only said $2.19 on the register the man got my attention again. As soon as I looked back at the register I noticed it was $4.19. I told her that it wasn't the usual price and she said \"I thought you wanted fried rice.\" I never said that. I never once said the word fried rice. She was \"kind\" enough to give me a refund. Normally I'd see this as a simple mistake but I've watched this same woman swipe other customers cards multiple times and throw away the extra receipts and only giving them one receipt back. This place is completely sketchy. While I was waiting for my food I saw some baby roaches on the counter. Pics included in the review. The same man asked me what my valentines plans were. I said I had none. He asked why. I said it's complicated. He then proceeded to say \"A pretty girl like you shouldn't be alone on Valentine's Day.\" I didn't respond. I just kept looking at my phone and backed away. He kept going on about how he's by my food on Valentine's Day. Obviously implying stuff. Eventually I told him he was making me uncomfortable and that I wouldn't be back. Oh and about the food.. the edamame sometimes has brown spots all over it. I can tell that it's old. I didn't even finish it because I kept thinking about the 3 bugs I saw on the counter."}
{"text":"We have been going here for almost 20 years now. The service is great and the food is incredible. The sashimi melts in your mouth and everything is extremely fresh. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"From the beginning this place was a disappointment, and it steadily went downhill from there. 
Walking in, they looked at me for about 10 seconds, staring in shock at me, as if I walked in with a horse head or something. I'm not sure if I'm not a common demographic that visits the restaurant, or what the deal was...Finally, they realized that I walked in with the hopes of being seated. (LOL) I got to sit at the sushi bar, and then it began...
I watched as one of the men behind the sushi counter cut up fish. He went through about 10 different fish types, opening packages, cleaning the counter, cutting the fish (with the same knife), AND NOT ONCE DID HE WASH HIS HANDS. He touched a cleaning rag, then went to touch the same fish, then touched doors, then touched a different fish. He would touch salmon, then touch a different fish. The disgusting amount of contamination in the restaurant was so sickening, too bad I had already ordered (luckily with no fish, only shrimp and scallops).
So, to start, I got a Miso Soup and I decided on the Scallop Roll and the Shrimp Tempura Roll, both rolls I've gotten all across the country and am very familiar with. 
The miso soup was $3! THREE FREAKIN DOLLARS? (2.95 to be particularly exact) I have eaten sushi on a beach in San Diego and didn't pay that much for a miso soup. The taste was off, almost greasy-tasting. Left a strange taste, so much so I ate two pieces of ginger as soon as I could. 
Then, my rolls. Not a piece of avocado on my plate. Not a slice of cucumber on my plate. So strange,  and yet I got charged so much for both rolls. I mean $6 for shrimp tempura is about average, but normally there's imitation crab meat and avocado/cucumber with the shrim tempura inside the roll. So disappointed. 
Then when it came time to pay, I waited 10 minutes to get the check then the waitress never came back and I ended up getting up and paying at the counter. Definitely a disappointing experience and I don't recommend this spot to anyone that knows sushi."}
{"text":"We have been here two hours and still no sushi so I can't even rate the food. The two beers ordered took thirty min---the soy sauce is great though. I dipped my finger in it as I looked around at All the other pissed off customers and chuckled. Not sure if we will return."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant. Best place to eat great samples and everything is really fresh ."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. Try the spicy scallop in seaweed.  Great service. Don't get intimidated by the sushi menu. Your server will guide you if you ask."}
{"text":"A great place to get a quick meal without paying too much. 

One of the food places in the Arrowhead Mall. This is one of the two places I usually eat at when I'm in the mall. The portions are very large, more than one man can eat, unless you have a giant's appetite.

I'm a big fan of their Chicken Teriyaki combo meal which is $5.99. Doesn't come with a drink, but for about $1.50 more you can get a medium drink to go with your meal. Meat, rice, veggies and a drink for $7.50 is a great deal, especially since I'm only able to eat about half of it. 

The meat is full of flavor and moist. Veggies are cooked nicely without being overcooked. Rice is steamed, so can't really say much about it other than it's good. I've only tried the Teriyaki chicken, so not sure how the other meats compare. Their chicken dumplings are also well flavored and not too dry. 

People that work here are always nice to talk and deal with. Food is prepared right in front of you. No complaints here from me."}
{"text":"Very nice sushi in Mt. Lebanon.  Service was prompt and friendly.  We enjoyed three not too expensive rolls--they have some great specialty rolls that are spendy (but worth the price!)--and had a great marinated beef and veggies dish.  The portions were satisfying and the bill was modest.  One of my favorite sushi places around."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better food options in the mall. The teriyaki chicken is very flavorful. You know it's fresh because they sell so much that they're always working on a fresh batch. It's tasty enough that we also order this via Uber Eats when we don't feel like driving to the mall. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered from UberEATS 

Everything tastes frozen beef was nasty 
Rice was dry 

Everything tasted salt less

{"text":"The owner Frank, he really nice and friendly. Sushi was really fresh especially on the raw fish. I got sea urchin last time, it was amazing!! I'm a big fan of Sushi and raw fish so I would recommend sushi lover to come to Little Tokyo:)"}
{"text":"I personally love Little Tokyo. Sushi is always fresh and delicious. Hibachi fantastic. This where we we went after new home closing. and we often take out of town gusts. Frank and his staff are very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I think Little Tokyo has the best sushi in Pittsburgh, hands down! It is always so fresh and of great quality. The owner is super nice and friendly as well as the wait staff. I've had many different types of rolls here and they are all delicious!! They are very accommodating with bigger parties as well as seating you at the bar. A great date place but just a great place in general!"}
{"text":"Always a good sushi spot.  I've had sushi a lot of different places in Pittsburgh and Little Tokyo in Mt Lebanon always hits the spot.  I'd consider in the top three. 
My wife and I had miso soup and the green salad as appetizers.  Both good, not great, but good.  
Then we got the eel sashimi - Great.
Pittsburgh roll - Okay.
Rainbow Roll - Good, I've had better though, the freshness was just decent.
and the Salmon Sashimi - Not bad, but again not great.

The service is good and the place is clean with good decor.  

Good date place too."}
{"text":"Brief lunch visit while in the area doing a photo shoot.  Easy access; good parking on the street and in the local municipal lots.  Friendly staff.  Food was okay but I had a small item, miso soup, for lunch.  Don't know about a full dinner venue."}
{"text":"I came here craving some sushi.  Looked up the best reviewed sushi place in my area and found this little restaurant.  I was excited at the front because it was a small restaurant and I love supporting small mom and pops.  

I figured this may be a little diamond in the rough.  Man, was I wrong.  The sushi was not fresh.  The sushi wasn't rolled tight either.  The rice didn't have the trademark sushi rice flavor. 

Spoiled by the fresh ingredients and catches of California, I felt like the ingredients were sort of old.  Considering I went in on a Saturday, I figured it might be better but it wasn't at all.

The service was good.  That's the justification for the 2 stars.  Otherwise, I really wouldn't recommend this place to other people."}
{"text":"The other night, a trying week of work and a recent tragedy that made national headlines weighed down our minds and morale. In search of some sort of uplift, we drove out to elegant Mt. Lebanon (the Shadyside of the unfairly ignored South Hills) for a Friday night meal. We almost supped at Kous Kous Cafe, but alas, we had no reservation, and we wouldn't be able to be accommodated for 30 to 45 minutes (small place!). Kay didn't want to wait that long, so across Washington Road we skipped, over to the marquee, big-city lights of Little Tokyo.

Despite its New York flair, LT has obviously carved out a comfortable presence for themselves in this posh suburban hamlet. The way the staff interacted with the customers indicated that LT is in fact a fixture here. The owner and servers alike chatted up regulars, exchanging hugs and handshakes as if they were entertaining relatives and old chums. The interiors were expectedly grand and neoteric. Wavy wall patterns were illuminated by soothing multi-colored lights and cylindrical lamps that hung down from the ceiling. The restaurant was particularly bustling and clangorous when we dined here, and that may have impacted the enjoyment of our meal, particularly when \"Happy Birthday\" blared from a PA system for someone's celebration. The recent discussions of restaurant noise levels had just hit home. 

Sushi: I enjoy it for the most part. I can't say I've had much in the way of bad sushi in Pittsburgh (I'd never had sushi until 5-6 years ago), but when it's been good, it's been identical to me in flavor and texture, regardless of where I had it or what was in it. LT's sushi was not exempt from this, and after having a serving of the Scallop Rolls, I wondered if sushi is what I should have adhered to. A wonderful, crispy, filling sextet of nori 'n rice nuggets, each one had a fresh scallop hidden inside it like a prize in the proverbial cereal box, and I ravaged my helping sans any sympathy, which is how I've always approached sushi. 

Being that I'm rather over sushi, I didn't want a meal of nothing but sushi, even if I felt obliged as a reviewer to have some for myself. So yes, Little Tokyo makes fine sushi. 

My dilemma was that I didn't know what else to order BUT sushi. Only the starters and salads sounded intriguing and distinct to me. With that said, I ordered a soup and a duo of appetizers. 

The Takosu, while listed as a salad, resembled a cold soup. The octopus was al dente and thinly sliced, but not so much that one couldn't see the suction cups. The ponzu sauce was tart, and the meat and accompanying vegetables positively swam in it. While I didn't resent the dish, I couldn't fully embrace it for some reason. It just didn't appeal to me greatly, and the serving was scant.

Disappointing me further was the Ebi Shumai. The six, shamefully tiny, rubber plugs filled with what was supposed to be shrimp failed to capture my culinary imagination, even after they were dunked in that dark \"dumpling sauce\". They literally tasted and felt like something a plumber would keep in his toolbox to stop up a leak. 

Nearly saving dinner, however, was the Unagi Kabayaki. Strips of fatty freshwater eel were laid before me on a bed of julienned cucumber and brushed with brackish teriyaki. Slather these in BBQ sauce and slow cook them over hot coals and you'll have a Southern classic. Seriously, this evoked the very best of what BBQ can be with its lardy flesh, bark-like skin, and sugar/salt slam. If only there was a meal-sized portion of this on the menu. I was still starving. 

Kay thankfully could not finish her massive bowl of Nabeyaki Udon, so I came in at Act IV to finish the job. The Udon noodles were a celebration of thick, doughy mouthfeel, and that's the only thing I enjoyed about this dish. Kay had eaten the egg, but I did get a tasteless bite of shrimp and as well as a gulp of the limp vegetables, but what really had me in a trick was that murky broth. I don't know if that was how it was supposed to taste, but damn it if it didn't seem like a warmed over sweet tea to me. 

The service was rather delightful, though. I am writing this review not without a pound of guilt in my belly for that reason. 

And when I got home, I was still flying light. Not even a bowl of ice cream sufficed.

Did I order the wrong things? Should I go back and try something else? Tell me. 

P.S. I've always liked those little flowers of shaved, sweet-pickled ginger."}
{"text":"Best fresh sushi in town. Their prices are great and the service is good. They also own the Little Tokyo in South Side and both places are awesome."}
{"text":"OK, update time.  Sushi we split was good.  Miso soup had an odd taste this visit.
My main course (Butaniku) was unforgettable, a real meh!  Not sure what happened this night.  

Our waitress was MIA most of the night.  Could not even find her to try to get refills, desert or our check.  

Must have been an off night for everyone."}
{"text":"The sushi here was great.  Everything tasted fresh and tender.  The restaurant is very clean as well, which always makes me more comfortable when going out for sushi.  The place was crowded but not over-bearing, and our service was great too.

By the way, I finally crossed Uni off my bucket list here.  I encourage those who have not tried it to do so sometime, but it was certainly a mouthful, and was definitely one of the more, well, interesting things I have eaten in a long while."}
{"text":"Food was good, very average and just a bunch of rolls - nigiri and sashimi are kinda an afterthought. I wish the menu identified the ingredients. Instead I had to ask the server (really nice lady, but definitely not quick and efficient - service was soooo slow) who kindly explained each one. I ended up choosing two and they were good, more like meh good. Since I'm from SoCal, I definitely wouldn't go here when I'm back in Pittsburgh again and would try to find another sushi joint."}
{"text":"Was at the mall around lunchtime and since I am still boycotting Panda Express for putting corn in their fried rice, we decided to give Little Tokyo a try. This place is in the spot where Bourbon Street Grill used to be. I ordered the teriyaki chicken combination plate with fried rice and noodles. The workers cooked up the meat right then and there. I was hoping for good things since it would be fresh. It was a lot of food! My b/f and I should have shared one entrée. The teriyaki sauce was weak sauce... literally. Almost no flavor really. The chicken was not the best quality. The rice was nothing special. The noodles were decent. Overall, I was not impressed, but it is the mall food court so you can't expect too much, though I think Bourbon Street Grill was better."}
{"text":"Ate here last night on a recommendation.  Fabulous!!  It was so busy we had to sit at the Sushi Bar, but they offered their full menu.  We got the Maki Combo Deluxe and the Maki Combo regular.  We asked the waitress if the Deluxe was large enough to split and she didn't think it was.  We (two petite women) had WAY too much food and took a full serving home from the two platters.  The miso soup was superior, but lacking seaweed (I prefer my own miso soup).  The dressing on the salad was great.  The Eel roll was the very best.  Actually, I have to say all of it was the best Japanese food I have ever had!  I will definitely drive the hour (had Dr. Apt) to visit this restaurant again.  It was a bit expensive, but mow I know to split the platter for two petite women.  :)"}
{"text":"Some of the better sushi to be had in Pittsburgh. Clean, fresh and consistent."}
{"text":"One of my go to places to get sushi in the South Hills. We have been coming here for years and are never disappointed. Their rolls are always freshly made to order. My personal favorite is the American Dream roll which is shrimp tempura, fried egg, rolled with a sauce on top. It is crunchy and tastes great. The First Date roll is also a hit with spicy tuna on top and rolled with salmon inside. Their plain spicy tuna roll is also very good. The philly roll is always a hit with smoked salmon and cream cheese. The only roll I have had that I did not like was the lobster roll. It is disappointing as it is not whole lobster meat but rather a mushed lobster salad.  

We also like to get their Ebi shrimp tempura as an appetizer. The shrimp is butterflied and fried in a delicate tempura batter. For being fried, they are so light and melt in your mouth! Also, their shrimp balls are a must. They are little balls of shrimp and cabbage deep fried served with a creamy shrimp dipping sauce. 

If we are not getting sushi, sometimes I will get the chicken and shrimp hibachi. They do not have hibachi seating so it is done in the back. Their shrimp sauce is great with the fried rice too! Overall, a great place to get fresh sushi and shrimp tempura."}
{"text":"Love Little Tokyo. Dedicated customers keep the place full all week long and on the weekends. If cleanliness is important to you, this is the restaurant you want. You could safely eat off the floors. Staff is friendly but unobtrusive. A definite favorite."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  Totally made up for the lousy Mexican dinner I had elsewhere the night before. 

I had fried shrimp balls, avocado roll, and shrimp tempura roll.  Sorry, I don't do the raw sushi any more.  If that makes me a less than significant sushi reviewer, then move on.

The food was all as fresh as can be.  The ginger was so fresh and delicious I almost ordered more.  I think it was the best ginger I have had in my life.

It was really nice to dine in a clean and relaxing environment and enjoy some GOOD food.  I really was mentally damaged by my awful dinner at Las Velas.  Glad to see Pittsburgh making it up to me!"}
{"text":"Food served hot and plentiful at a decent price. Employees cheerful and accommodating."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I'm here between 1-4 times a week. I've never had the freshness and exquisite style of the fish here anywhere else. I prefer to eat sashimi over rolls so that being said the freshness, temperature and options of the fish are extremely vital in finding a place that serves it. I won't eat sashimi anywhere else. I've been coming here for almost 15 years now. The staff is like family now."}
{"text":"If you like sushi Little Tokyo is the place for you. Many visits here and I've yet to have a complaint nor do I think I ever will. Even the little salads with ginger dressing are so good. Miso soup is some of the best around. Honestly the sushi is far better than many places in and around Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is them most consistent sushi we have found anywhere in the Burgh. The prices are reasonable and so are the portions. If we want sushi, we go here. Get the Black Marlin sashimi if you go. Deluxe sashimi combo is worth the 25 bucks taboot

4 of 5 stars probably second only to Umi in Pittsburgh for flavor"}
{"text":"Since moving to Mt. Lebanon, this is by far my favorite of the resturants on Washington Rd. The sushi is great.  The entrees are great. The staff is very nice and attentive. Can't say enough good things about this resturant."}
{"text":"The owners, Frank & Diane, take great care to make sure that their guest is always treated perfectly. Their staff does too.  I always get the sushi which is wonderful. It is very fresh. My wife usually gets items off of the grill and says that they are excellent as well.  I have been going to this restaurant since it opened and have always had a great experience."}
{"text":"Pretty much exactly what you would expect with no surprises. Fresh sushi, traditional dishes all nicely presented. The staff is polite and service good. The restroom is spotless. At the beginning of The meal the piped in jazz was fast and jarring, not conducive to a relaxing meal, but it soon toned down to a soothing pace, making the color changing wall lights a more relaxing experience."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever, can't wait to try it once again. Deserves every penny, in the end you get what you pay for. If you're sushi fan, then you must try this place. By far the best ever sushi in Pittsburgh . The waitresses are so friendly . The environment so elegant, lavish, and classy . I highly recommend this restaurant ."}
{"text":"This is amazing sushi.  I have not tried the hibachi but it is nice that they have it for dining with a mixed sushi/non sushi eating crowd.  

The sushi is spectacular and there is high attention to detail.  The miso soup is made completely from scratch, no cans.  The grated radish and other garnishes are made fresh daily.  There is no hint of staleness in anything.  The bartender is also generous in his pours.  We are never in a hurry when we go for sushi so I haven't paid too much attention to the time it takes but they always bring out the next item as we are finishing the previous.  We have frequented here for a little over a year and always leave very pleased.  

For the food quality and attention to detail the prices are also extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another shot and I am so happy I did - they totally redeemed themselves! Service was prompt and friendly and the sushi was absolutely perfect. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great sushi stop in Mt. Lebanon. Why the 3 stars? Service. The restaurant was EMPTY. We made it clear that we needed to be quick, but that didn't change anything for the service. It was still slow with everything from the drinks to the food to the bill. We ended up being late to our event, but at least we had full tummies. The sushi is great, really. It would just be better if it came in a decent time."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend's and my favorite date night right now.  Aside from the sushi being UH-MAZING, the atmosphere is cool and very non-Lebo -- unless you're there during a 5 year old's birthday dinner, which always makes you ask why.  But then you remember you're in Mt. Lebanon.  This does not detract from the experience, but merely adds to the people watching.  Frank is a great owner, and is always floating around in case you have any concerns.  The prices are great, and you always feel like you got more than what you paid for.  I've been going to Little Tokyo probably for at least 15 years, and will continue to go for as long as possible.  For a light lunch, I recommend the Sansai salad and shrimp tempura roll.  For a satisfying dinner, I recommend the edamame, a dragon roll, and a discovery roll.  I'm drooling just thinking about it..."}
{"text":"Hurray Little Tokyo!  

I haven't been here in years, but this is THE place that I got introduced to sushi.  I still remember hesitantly slurping down my first salmon roll thinking raw fish must be the most awful thing in the world... and well, kinda loving it.  

The owners are good friends of my family, from back when we lived in Pittsburgh.  I remember when they were first starting out--my dad helped design and build the sushi counter, and my mom made the original cushions and server uniforms.  One time, I had an epic wasabi-eating contest with the owner's son.  On many a weekend as a kid I would go and stuff my face with all the sushi I could eat.  I know for a fact they use the freshest fish. 

I may be biased, but I think my early experiences with massive-sushi-overload helped refine my tastebuds and make me the sushi snob I am today.  Oh yeah, and they have FRIED ICE CREAM."}
{"text":"I have been really hungry for Japanese food, so I tried Little Tokyo Saturday night after the movies. 

The kitchen was very skilled and helpful. I ordered two items not on the menu, a miso ramen, and salmon roe with quail egg sushi. 

I'm not sure what was wrong with my server. She didn't know what miso ramen was. She didn't want to ask the kitchen if they would make it, and tried to talk me into udon or soba instead. When I again asked her to ask the kitchen if they would make miso ramen, they immediately said yes. Same procedure with the sushi order. 

I got to the restaurant around 9:45 and they close at 10:30. My salad and green tea came out right away. The salad dressing was delicious. Unfortunately, the pieces of lettuce were HUGE. As I was eating with chopsticks, this was problematic. I had to fold each piece of lettuce in half and then in half again to be able to get it into my mouth. 

Next came my ramen. The soup did not have much miso in it- I believe they had made it with their usual miso soup as a base. When the server brought out the ramen, it had a ladle in it, but no spoon was offered. I asked her for a spoon, and she pointed to the ladle and said, \"there.\"  I had to bother the sushi chefs to get her to bring me a spoon. Although they did not put pork, or egg, or corn into the soup as is customary, they did have lots of julienne vegetables - bamboo shoot, zucchini, carrot, etc., and they made the soup delicious. I was very pleased with it. 

Next came my salmon roe and quail egg sushi. The sushi was very fresh, and the portions fairly large. It was also tasty. 

While there were still lots of people in the restaurant, my server started taking the soy sauce and silver ware off the sushi bar and the empty tables - at 10:05 pm. The message was pretty clear - finish up and get out!!

There were four front of house staff and six cooks/chefs working. There was plenty of time to get the place cleared by 10:30. When I tried to pay my bill at 20 after, everyone had disappeared. I had to call out three times before someone came to take my payment.

I stopped in the ladies room on my way out, and there was no toilet paper!

If I had to rate this restaurant on the food alone I would've given it five stars. However, the place seems to be geared to the staff's needs over and above those of the customers."}
{"text":"This is by far some of the best local sushi I have had. You can go to a big $$$$ expensive restaurant but why? We have a great local place with fresh sushi for a fraction of the cost"}
