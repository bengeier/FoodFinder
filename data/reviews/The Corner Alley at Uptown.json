{"text":"Now ive eaten here before, and its nothing special- although it is a bowling alley so its to be expected. But the service is the worst ever!! The server we had was rude to us throughout the whole experience. She gave us this attitude when we told her we wanted the check split in half.  The bartender didn't even know how to make the drink we asked. We asked for Ameretto and they had no clue what it was. After which we had to wait forever to get a round of drinks and had to order from 3 seperate servers because they kept \"forgetting\" our simple order of 2 jack and cokes, and 1 ameretto and whiskey. Worst and slowest service ive ever had. After getting our drink order wrong twice they gave us the check."}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience at the Corner Alley. They serve the typical assortment of bar food- burgers, sandwiches, pizza, etc. The food was decent and nothing that prompts me to pin it as a \"must-visit in Cleveland.\" I ordered the chicken tenders and a burger- both were average portions and I was definitely well-fed. The atmosphere is great especially if you get a seat at the bar- it makes you feel like you're at a sports bar which I totally dig. The bartender who works there is very attentive and helpful. I wasn't disappointed with the dining experience, but I wasn't blown out of the water either."}
{"text":"Hey blonde haired girl working the shoe return..I am sorry that you clearly hate your job, but because you do, that does not give you the right to huff and puff like the big bad wolf when I go to exchange a small pair of shoes for the next size up.  If you are incapable of basic human contact at your place of work perhaps go work in a factory or a graveyard..."}
{"text":"This is the no-fun corner alley.

It's pretty hard to believe that this place is owned by the same group that owns the corner alley on east 4th.
If you expect to come here and be treated with the same level of service you are accustomed to at the one on 4th prepare to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped here over the weekend and really enjoyed it! I can't speak to any of the entrees, as we picked this venue more for drinks and appetizers; but, both myself and my friend's mixed drinks were quite good and the apps as well. We also had a great waitress, and now I'm kicking myself that I can't remember her name. A good place to take a crowd, as everyone would find something they liked."}
{"text":"I come there often to bowl and see my favorite bartender Lanie she is adorable! She knows how to make me laugh because after a hard shift at the hospital it's good to come to a establishment where you can have a good drink and eat highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service!  The venue is beautiful and the bowling was a blast!  I highly recommend The Corner Alley at Uptown for a fun night out!!"}
{"text":"It's a pretty nice place since they upgraded it, but I have not actually eaten here yet. Just drinks! The service is mediocre, which is why I gave it a 3, but the white peach margarita is phenomenal, so I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Arrived at approximately 8:20 pm with my husband, expecting to have a fun date night with no kids. Only to find out from the guy at the front cashier that they're closing and the cash drawer has already been taken to the back...but the website says they close at 10. That's an hour and a half until the posted closing time. We of course complain and ask for the manager, whom we waited for another 20 minutes until she finally came over and explained they close early when it's a slow night. Meanwhile there's a family of 6 at one lane who we watched get 4 trays of food, a couple at the bar ordering new drinks, and another couple eating. 

After the manager goes upstairs to grab us a coupon for our next time going, a group comes through the door wanting to bowl but gets turned away when they learn corner alley doesn't want anymore business for the night EVEN THOUGH THE TIME SAYS OPEN TIL 10! 

The amount of time wasted, we could have finished a game already and been on our way."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I went on at Thursday afternoon around 4PM. Only a few other lanes were taken and we were able to get three games in for the hour slot that we had. As we played, we got a few appetizers and a pizza to share. Service was good, prices were great and the food was yummy! This was my first time visiting (not hers) and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely the most modern bowling alley I have been to.  It almost feels weird because I expect a bowling alley to be dingy, dirty, serve Michelob Light in a can and have root beer schnapps shot specials.  Nice bowling alley.  For 4 of us on a Friday night for 2 games and shoes was $50.  Food is pretty good.  The Hawaiian pizza and medium wings were good.  The burgers were bad.  Looked like cafeteria meat so skip that."}
{"text":"Although there weren't many choices, the sliders and sandwiches tasted really good. But the dishes were served very slow. We had a very good time playing bowling there."}
{"text":"Great place for both family fun (day) and relaxing adult venue (eve) great bowling, nice drink selection and most importantly the nicest staff of anywhere. We keep on coming back! Highly recommended for all ages from kids to college students to an after work escape all are welcome and have a good time."}
{"text":"For a bar/bowling I would give it five stars. Great place to come out have drinks and some food and play some games such as bowling on the lanes they have. Good location on the end of fourth street as well. Food was more a 3.5 . My burger was over cooked and soggy on the bottom, but still tasted good. The loaded brisket fries were too watery. I had a few bites of pizza and that was pretty good actually so I would get that if I came again. Wings were just ok and the few bites I tried Of my moms southwest salad was good too. The menu has a wide variety and some different items so good for a crowd. Less fancy than the other area restaurants on east 4 so it's nice to have this as an option.

If you are going to bowl on weekend or even later at night you may need a reservation. I would suggest calling ahead to be safe bc the bowling portion is pretty popular ."}
{"text":"Stopped in with the family on a snowy weekday afternoon during winter break.  About eight other well behaved families had the same idea.  This place is bright, clean, well decorated, with a ton of large screen tvs - not like the smoke filled, drunk old man in the corner bowling allies of my youth.  The lane is paid for by the hour and not by game or per person.  For the kids they had ramps, lighter weight balls, and bumpers that would raise when it was their turn and sadly lower when it was my turn.  

After bowling we headed over to the restaurant area for some kid and adult friendly food. While the service was a tad slow the food was good. My daughter and I shared the very tasty baked potato pizza (just like a loaded potato) while the boys downed buttermilk fried chicken fingers.  But the best part of the meal was the dessert: funnel fries.  A funnel cake in fry shape, dusted with a ton of powdered sugar and a side of raspberry sauce.  So good!

And to top off the whole experience some of their arcade games are free. Motorcycle races and killing zombies for everyone."}
{"text":"Bowling was fun but service for dinner after was horrible. I felt terrible for our server; we had a group of 13 and we were her first table ever. No joke!!  No one trained her and the manager who we could see in a lovely floral print moo moo, was more concerned about drinking coffee and chorteling with her co workers than helping the poor girl who waited on us. Our server should be promoted to manager and the manager fired!!  Felt so bad for her."}
{"text":"The College ID night is definitely worth the trip to uptown. An hour of free bowling (shoes not included) and discounted drinks made for a fun night! The only downside was the service - the staff were less than helpful on all fronts. After paying, the front desk didn't tell us a lane number, leaving us waiting awkwardly until we could finally ask. We skipped on the food, but the waitress didn't write anything down for our drinks, leading her to forget one for our party. All in all, the Corner Alley at uptown is a fun spot with iffy service. Maybe your service depends on the day?"}
{"text":"Needed a to go order for my son, ordered a burger. I have no idea who runs this place, but they need re-training! An hour! for a to go burger, when we finally got it, it was OK and fries were soggy, like they were seating under a heating lamp. I am ok waiting for food but this was beyond ridiculous! For an average food! And bartender didn't even look like she cared after we asked to check on our food. And other people at the bar had to wait 20-30 min just to order their drinks, pretty pathetic experience overall."}
{"text":"This place is loud and high energy so be warned if you're looking for a quite spot, this isn't it. The service here is great, beer selection is decent and food is good, not great. It seems higher end price wise, but overall a great place for a fun event, birthday party or such. If I lived in Cleveland, I imagine me and my friends would be here often."}
{"text":"Place is very nice! Management and staff need fixing. A few times we've been turned away due to lanes being unavailable but all the lanes upstairs are empty. The staff is not very customer service oriented or helpful. The place has lots of potential and the problems seem like they could be easily fixed."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I didn't eat anything or go bowling here. I stopped by while waiting for my friends to get to the Hessler street fair. 

I waited 5 minutes for a barmaid- with only 3 other customers- to ask what I wanted. I ordered a Hoegaarten, which admittedly is not the cheapest beer in the world, but when I took the check for $7.03 i was pissed. $7.03? I could have bought most of a 6 pack with that!

The other things that I walked away remembering are that 1) the bar stools were uncomfortable as could be. 2) The bathrooms are all the way upstairs. 3) It was hot in there. It's 80 degrees outside guys, turn on the AC. 

Would not return."}
{"text":"My friends and I have really enjoyed ourselves each time we've been here. The atmosphere is really great and you would think that the bowling alley section would overpower the restaurant section since they are basically right next to each other, but I really didn't notice it while we were eating. 

The last time we were here there was one of those painting parties upstairs and I would love to do one of those!"}
{"text":"Currently sitting in corner alley, eating cold fries after a 30 minute wait. The place is almost dead and yet the kitchen couldn't get food out on time. Our waitress could barely open her mouth and the other servers are sitting around or dancing to the music, wish I was enjoying my experience as much as they are. I could understand if they were busy, but come on! For such a nice establishment the service is crap!"}
{"text":"This seemed like a really cool place in Uptown. I've walked past it many times.

Overall, the experience for our date night was mediocre. While the food was decent, the cocktails were weak despite their appearance of being craft cocktails.

Additionally, the service was slow and very disorganized. At one point in our meal, another server who was not our own asked, \"What drink did you order?\" I told her. She responded by saying, \"That doesn't look like any of our normal drinks and doesn't look like what you ordered.\" She did not offer a replacement.

I imagine it's a great place for bowling with friends but it's not a great dining experience. I won't return."}
{"text":"The bartender and kitchen manager were awesome this afternoon for taking great care of my son.  He is undergoing treatment for leukemia at UH Rainbow and has not had much appetite but a steak sounded good to him.  We are anxious to get him to eat anything so this was a good thing. 

I was disappointed to find out that the steak was no longer on the menu.  The bartender went to talk to the kitchen manager to see what he could do. The manager came out, introduced himself and said that he would take care of my son.  He went back and prepared a delicious steak and side dish for my son. 

When he brought the food out, he asked for my son's name so that he could pray for him and then said that he was taking care of the bill for me. 

The kindness, caring, and generosity of the staff was beyond compare.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for bowling and dinner. The bowling was fun and the food was good - but the service was terrible. It took twenty minutes to get drink orders placed - and only after my friend physically got up from our table to find a server to come over to us. Then, after finally getting our waters, my friend had to get up again and ask the bartender for a pitcher of water so HE could re-fill our drinks. Bad service ruined the experience for us."}
{"text":"Great place to unwind after a sporting event. We've had several of the appetizers and cocktails. All served by a courteous staff. The bowling alley is awesome. Cleveland needed this place. Great windows to people watch. Will go back whenever we can"}
{"text":"This place is really cool!  Just from looking at the entrance you feel like you're walking into a really fun place. I was here for the Cocktail Muse event. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The decor of this place is really fun, they totally rolled with the bowling theme. We didn't get a chance to bowl but there's going lanes downstairs and upstairs. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"The food here is good. Chef salad is amazing. Management is reasonable.  Beware of Sundays!!!!! The bartender does not understand customer service. She must have been a prison guard the way she treats customers. How she has a job in the service industry is beyond me."}
{"text":"Terrible service and very unhelpful when trying to make a reservation. Half the facility empty yet could not get a lane. Would not recommend to anyone if they have not planned way ahead of time."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the staff worked hard I paid for four people to bowl but one person couldn't' bowl at the time so I asked for a refund or credit the staff call for the manager to come down they never came down and the manager told them they don't give refunds or credit so they stole my money also there are no signs saying that once you pay you don't get anything back or credit next asked for the bowling balls never put back so you have to walk around the place looking for bowling balls OSHA or the government needs to check this place out so many section Codes broken would not recommend to no one"}
{"text":"I used to come here every Thursday for College Night up until April. I'm under 21 so usually they just mark an X on my hands. Fine. But the last time I went, they stopped me at the door and said that they don't allow anyone under 21 in past 9pm, and claim it's been always their rule. Absolutely ridiculous!

In addition, I would always call to reserve a lane on Thursdays before noon for later that night (College Night). They let me reserve a lane a couple of times. But several times, the person would tell me that they don't take reservations for College Night. It's not even a \"they used to take reservations, but now they changed their policy\" problem. The answer would always change back and forth every week."}
{"text":"This place has a special place in my heart. 

Not because of the food or drinks, but because of all the fun stuff they offer! 

My coworkers and I (who worked around the corner at the VA) took advantage of their medical professional discount. We were there almost every week during warmer months enjoying either bowling, playing board games, or corn hole out front. 

I really liked how we would just come here and \"hang out\" with a glass or two of brewskies and never felt pressured to order food. Always plenty of seating and friendly staff!

Their food is your typical bar food so don't expect to be wowed. 

Happy hour was also a great deal."}
{"text":"Second time here--second time with a HUGE wait for the food. Kicking myself for forgetting... Do not come here unless you're Job or you have unlimited time to waste."}
{"text":"The venue was a fun and friendly spot to entertain our teens while visiting Cleveland. The overall atmosphere and food/drink options were great for the parents, too. We stayed for dinner afterwards and were pleasantly surprised by the high end offerings and artisan food served. The salads were super sized gourmet treats and easily adapted to meet some dietary needs. 

We highly recommend the happy hour during the weekday evenings w/free shoe rental and discounted lanes. It wasn't too packed and made for a good mid-week activity!"}
{"text":"This is such a fun addition to University circle.  I've been here twice; both times to watch football games.  There are at least twenty widescreen tvs here.  Its two stories with bars and bowling lanes on each floor.  They take reservations and have valet  parking.  Both times I got the chicken tenders.  I wouldn't come here specifically for the food but rather for the \"activity dining\" atmosphere.  Bowling for walk ins is 35$ per hr but 50$ per hr for reservations.  The shoe rental is 3$.  The entrees are 10 to 20$ and mixed drinks around 8 to 10$.  This is my go to place to watch big games.  Bowling here with a group friends will always make for an enjoyable event."}
{"text":"Great customer service. I was there for the Cleveland.com tweet up and the happy hour included free shoe rental and discounted play - $4.25/person per game."}
{"text":"We had a group reservation for 2 lanes for 7-9pm on a Sunday night. Called and confirmed the Friday before for a friend's birthday. When we showed up, they claimed to not have our reservation and that there were two separate parties that had booked the upstairs and downstairs venues. Although the manager apologized, she said there was nothing that could be done as all lanes were already reserved until 8pm. Ok, fine. We went to ABC Tavern across the street with out 15 person party for some food and beers. Two of us tried to go back at 8pm when one of the private parties were supposed to finish to ask if we could reserve a couple lanes then since they supposedly close at MIDNIGHT. We were told by Alex at the front desk that it was company policy to not take new reservations after private parties and to \"not ruin this for her.\" Whatever that meant. Saw later her and a bunch of her co-workers at ABC Tavern at around 9pm. Ridiculous. Love bowling with friends, love Italian food, cannot stand lazy, unprofessional, incompetent people. Ugh."}
{"text":"What happened?? Shortly after opening, I had an amazing experience but this past week was awful. Slow and unfriendly service. Was put on a lane behind a pole, the lane shut down by accident and had to be reset. Was not allowed to order at the bar and took the lazy waitress 20 min to wander over. The food was sloppy and bland. Still expensive as ever though. 

Only good comment, the drink I got was strong. Of course they were out of the first three requests. VERY DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"This place has a really nice atmosphere & surprisingly good food for a bowling alley. However, if you want to bowl on a weekend I strongly suggest calling & making a reservation. We went with our kids on Sat around 5:30 & didn't expect it to be so crowded. They were VERY disappointed to leave without getting to bowl :("}
{"text":"When all was said and done we had fun, but the service was off and our specific bowling lane, #7, has big pillars blocking the views of the lane from the seats. After putting our name down to wait for a lane there was no staff to seat us for food, we eventually found a table ourselves after first sitting at a row of tables that hadn't been bussed, and even then the plates at the table were dirty. We finally went up and ordered from the bar because no one ever waited on our table. The bartender did continue the good service for drinks though while we were bowling. Still not likely to come back again."}
{"text":"Man this place keeps getting better. The Bourbon Glaze wings are literally the best tasting wings ever. Tried a normal burger. Again awesome. Amanda makes fantastic drinks. This is a great place!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was below average. Four of us went in on a Friday night at 6:30pm, no reservation but we were sat without waiting too long. The hostess wasn't at the stand so we had to wait for a minute for someone to notice we were even there. We said, \"There's 4 of us,\" and he replied with, \"for what.\" Kind of awkward. We figured out he was giving us the option of bowling or dining. Our waitress was pleasant but didn't write anything down, resulting in mistakes from our drink orders on through our food orders. The food was definitely good, we ordered the nachos as an appetizer and queso on top was great! The Italian burger was also amazing, great portion size."}
{"text":"We arrived at 9:30 on Sunday evening. According to both Yelp and Corner Alley's website, they were supposed to be open until midnight. We sat outside and a very polite lady brought us menus and asked if we wanted to order drinks. A second waitress who was unfriendly, abrupt and rude - told us it was last call and we needed to order now if we wanted anything. We were surprised and offered to go elsewhere when we learned that they actually closed at 10. She said it was fine, but we should have left. Our food took 45 minutes to arrive and once we got it, the TV was shut off - we were watching a no hitter in a baseball game at the time. So rude. I'm giving a two star because the food was actually decent. Service was disappointing."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and probably one of the best in the uptown area. I've gotten their wild mushroom burger twice and it's huge. Probably 1/3 lb. The service during lunchtime is abysmal though -- don't expect water refills without having to ask."}
{"text":"We brought my daughter, some of her cousins and 4 adults here tonight and I just wanted to comment that the staff could not have been more friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Cool, pleasant , caring staff , friendly regulars, including Case College Students, good security provided by CPD, -- the atmosphere is good , especially if you like bowling and video arcade games, and so are the drinks. The food ? Is ok....The guy I brought with me suggested the portions were too small, but not in my opinion. It was more about taste. All things considered? 3/5 stars."}
{"text":"WARNING: DO NOT RESERVE LANES FOR A NIGHT EVENT OR COME HERE EXPECTING PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE

If I could give them 0 stars I would. My friend reserved lanes for a wedding after party the weekend of April 22. When we arrived to Corner Alley they first refused to serve one member of the party citing they were too intoxicated, which was not the case. They then said they wouldn't serve any of us saying it was because the groom hadn't arrived (they were cleaning up their venue). At this point, there are about 25-30 members of the wedding party there and they wouldn't even discuss it with us or be agreeable. It seemed like at this point they just wanted to close up for the night and didn't want to have to deal with all these people (which if you look at other reviews seems to be a trend).

We ended up going to Euclid Tavern who was more than happy to accommodate us (and take our money) and had an exceptional time."}
{"text":"Agreed with many of the reviews here.  Been here about 5 times now. Service is consistently poor.   Understaffed.  Staff not friendly and borderline incompetent.  Came to bowl and were told nothing was available.  Asked if anything would open up since the 5 kids would be disappointed.  We're told in half an hour.  They didn't come get us and went to ask.  Just ahead of us a group got 2 lanes for 2 hours.  They squeezed us in for a lane for an hour.   15 minutes in table just got cleaned and waitress came to get order finally.  Took 3 requests and 15 minutes to get bumpers out up for a group of kids including two under 5.  In the meanwhile there are 6 empty lanes upstairs  (have been all night) and 6 other lanes are dark  and half been for or over 30 minutes.  Either the staff is lazy or some corporate restriction limits the number of people they are willing to serve.  Great location.  Food is decent but the service alone is enough to drive you insane."}
{"text":"I actually do like their food here! It's a spacious place and to bring friends for some bowling and food. It a more sophisticated feel to a usual bowling alley, which I like."}
