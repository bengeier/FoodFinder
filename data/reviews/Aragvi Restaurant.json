{"text":"What the heck Yelp friends? Went here based on the reviews and was quite disappointed. We ordered chicken and veal. My daughter got her food first (chicken fingers and fries) and it was quite good. My husband's dish came out a bit after and was pretty good but very salty and the meat was really tough. I watched my family finish their meals and finally got mine about 10-15 minutes later. No apology, no explanation, nothing. I didn't complain because I had just finished my enormous 'shot' of vodka (which is definitely a plus at this place). My chicken meal was gross. The chicken that was used was not very good quality at all."}
{"text":"I had been itching to try Georgian cuisine for years, but Toronto, for all its multicultural glory, did not provide such an establishment until the opening of Aragvi some years back. Immediately upon discovering it, I decided to check it out with a friend for my birthday.  I was absolutely not disappointed. This is truly one of Toronto's culinary gems, and Georgian cuisine surely one of the world's most scrumptious.   The restaurant is small, with about 7 tables, and though the decor is somewhat dated, I like to think it gives the restaurant a somewhat \"authentic\" ambiance.   A large party of burly Russian/Georgian men occupied two of these tables, but luckily we only had to wait about 10 minutes for ours. Immediately we were treated to famed Georgian hospitality when our waitress, the owner's daughter, offered us a complimentary serving of Imeretian Khatchapuri, a baked cheese-topped dough. Apparently a neighboring table had changed their mind, and because we had mentioned we'd not tried Georgian cuisine before, she wanted to ease us in with an appetizer.  The Imeretian Khatchapuri was flavourful, with gooey baked Georgian cheese blending perfectly with rich and heavy dough. However, this would still not stop me from ordering what I had come for, the Adjarian Khatchapuri. This is similar, though the dough is baked in the shape of a canoe; in the middle, rich melted Georgian cheese and butter. A raw egg is plopped on top before serving. One breaks off chunks of the bread and dips in the cheese/butter/egg mixture on top. Truly, could there be a better starter for a carbs-n-dairy lover such as myself?  After gorging on two khatchapuri variants, we still thought it appropriate to order a serving of the famed khinkali dumplings. I have had my fair share of vareniki, pierogi, gyoza, momos etc, but there is no better dumpling than the khinkali. Huge, juicy, and literally bursting with meaty flavour.  For my main course, I opted for the chakhokbili chicken stew. The flavor of unusual spices, blended with juicy chunks of chicken breast, cilantro, and a white wine sauce was truly divine. Though half-way through, I was becoming full due to my insistence on three starters, I found a way to make it through. There was no way I could stop.  Paired with some fine Georgian white wine, this was one of the greatest meals I've had the pleasure of eating in Toronto; with so many fine restaurants in this city, that's not a compliment earned easily.   For those interested in trying something fresh, something new, Aragvi in North York is highly recommended. Mightily tasty food, great hospitality, and reasonable on the wallet. What's not to love!"}
{"text":"Tonight my boyfriend and I just decided to eat somewhere in the area and stumbled across this gem on yelp for Georgian food. The outside of the restaurant looks a bit sketchy because of the area and its surrounding buildings but you should definitely go inside and give it a shot. There is a very stark contrast and its inside is nothing like you would expect. While it did seem a bit weird to have banquet style seat covers in such a small place, it did look very nice and cozy for decor. We ordered the Imeretinskoe Hachapuri, Khinkali, Chanakhi and Kupati.  Imeretinskoe Hachapuri, the cheese bread specialty of the Georgian province of Imereti, was suggested to us by the waitress and I am so glad we got it. This was absolutely delicious! We only ate 2/4 slices so we would have some room for the rest of the food and some really tasty leftovers as a midnight snack or lunch tomorrow.  Then there's the piping hot Khinkali. Like another reviewer said earlier, they do seem similar to the siu long bao. It's just that the pastry layer is much thicker and the dumpling itself is about the size of half my fist. People sure weren't kidding when they say that it's bigger than you'd think. In hindsight, I realize that I should have probably included a fork for comparison but you can get a sense of its size by looking at the base of the wine glass in my photo. We should have probably ordered only the Imeretinskoe Hachapuri or the Khinkali rather than both. If there weren't a minimum order or 5 dumplings then we probably would have just gotten 2 so we could have the entire cheese bread and the dumplings without ending up too full.  The Chanakhi veal stew was indeed unbelievably tasty as the menu described. The meat was so tender! The Kupati plate was basically 3 sausages with veggies and potato. This dish I didn't like as much as the others but it was beautifully presented.  Overall the food was delicious and beautifully presented. Oh, and remember to bring cash because the restaurant doesn't accept debit or credit."}
{"text":"I love Georgian food and this is the only place in the city that serves it so I made the trek from Downsview station and I was not disappointed.   Sure it might look a bit dodgy from outside but that has never kept me from entering a restaurant. The waitress was really nice to us and had a sense of humour - we ordered one appetizer and two mains between two people and asked whether that was enough, she replied that we'll kill her if she makes us order more. And it was true, we had plenty of leftovers to take with us.   To start we went with a few bottles of Borjomi which is a Georgian mineral water. Some people say it's an acquired taste but it's a taste worth acquiring. Slightly salty, very refreshing. If you love it, you can get it from Starsky's in Mississauga. I suspect that they have a reasonable corkage fee but I'm not sure.   The appetizer was Adjarian Hachapuri which is basically a salty and cheesy bread with an egg on top. The bread's hot and the egg cooks on the bread, it's exactly as wonderful and gooey as it sounds.   Mains were Jerusalem Mix (chicken giblets) and Kupati (home-made sausages) with a salad and Armenian potatoes on the side. The portions were generous, the potatoes crispy and the salad refreshing and authentic. Everything is made to order so it took perhaps 20 minutes to arrive at the table.   I can not wait to go back! The food was good, the service was warm and prices reasonable. I have no idea why Georgian cuisine is not more popular in Toronto."}
{"text":"We paid a visit to this place yesterday and were glad we did. I first learned about Georgian cuisine when I was researching a trip to Russia. It seems we do not have other Georgian restaurants in Toronto (or do we?) but it's just as well as this place is a real gem. The food was delicious, service was warm, patient, and friendly, prices were very fair. The place is a little small (six tables which allow for a total of about 32 people) and gets cramped, but not so noticeable unless there are groups of families, which there were when we went--still it adds to the liveliness. Aragvi is located in a dinky strip alongside a few other businesses and maybe some apartments on top. It would be easy to drive right past the place without ever noticing it.  When you go, you'll know what I mean.  We started off with the adjarian kachapuri, the traditional version with the egg on top. I don't like my eggs that runny and our server was kind enough to offer it without the yolk--brilliant. The dough was so soft and had a trace of sweetness to it, and went perfectly with a few swirls in the egg+cheese in the centre. We also ordered several kinkali (another trademark Georgian dish) and to my surprise, tasted EXACTLY like Korean steamed mandu! If you know what that's like, maybe avoid this dish just to enjoy something else, otherwise try it if only to see for yourself as they can be ordered individually.   Among the mains ordered were:  - chanakhi - chunks of eggplant and brisket meat in a flavourful sauce of spices (but not spicY), onions, and coriander. The combination of the spices and coriander gave this dish an unmistakeable SE Asian flavour. You should probably order it with their house bread ($2 for a generous portion) or rice as I can't imagine eating this dish on its own, though there's no law preventing one from doing so.  - Russian kebob *my least favourite dish - not sure what made these pork kebobs Russian, but consisted of chunks of meat, which are covered in slivered red onions and come with pickled cabbage; salad of tomato, cucumber, onion, dill; and Armenian potatoes which are fried (but not at all greasy) and flavoured with garlic and dill. I could have feasted on these potatoes alone, they were that good! They reminded me a lot of the garlic potatoes you get at the Lebanese places in Montreal, but different shape and less grease. Anyway they were DAMN GOOD. I think you have the option of these potatoes vs rice but why the hell would you do that?? What turned me off this dish was the strong porkiness (you know what I mean!) of the meat but that can happen sometimes with pork so don't go overlooking this dish altogether.  - chicken kebob - also served with the above; meat was very tender and juicy. Their kebob platters are single skewer (there was no indication that one can order another but I'm sure they will provide if you ask).  If you're more about the food, service, and like to try various cuisines and less about the decor, check out Aragvi, which I should also add is very reasonably priced. Our server, who seemed to be the owner, was super-nice and accommodating (not that we were being difficult) and said a couple of times that \"anything is possible\", as in, they can make changes if need be. (Please don't go in there being one of those annoying customers who wants every little thing changed, at least not when I'm there.) She reminded me of a Georgian (if she is) version of Tina Turner, though I did not check out her legs.   I'm no expert on Georgian cuisine but I know what I like and I liked this place a lot. The only thing I might change if I had to pick something that prevents Aragvi from being perfect or face having my eyeballs gouged out, it might be the interior (even though I am about the food and service, and enjoy trying different foods!). At present, there are banquet-style seat covers on the chairs which don't go over so well in such a small place; the room just needs a little updating, though if it were to stay the same, I'd still go. I don't mind that the place is small; it serves as a reminder that it is a family-run restaurant, one with warm service and good, comforting food."}
{"text":"Appetizer Assortment (phkali, izpanahi, Georgian style eggplant roll, marinated peppers, mushrooms & babaganoush): One of the appetizers had a gritty quality that made me 100% sure that there was dirt in it (something wasn't washed). Other than that, everything was delicious and worth the money.  Kyufta Bozbash: great  Adjarian Hachapuri: sinfully delicious  Khinkali: great  Chanakhi: very good  Tabaka: not my favourite kind of food, but very good  Lamb Chops: good.  Armenian Potatoes: great side  The service was relatively friendly. What makes this restaurant stand out, in addition to the extremely good food, is that, unlike the other pretentious Central Asian restaurants in Toronto, a) the prices are very reasonable, this place is the least expensive and b) you can do takeout if you want. I really appreciate the latter.  4.5/5"}
{"text":"My girlfriend loves trying out exotic foods from all over so we ended up in this tiny little Georgian restaurant. Not many people for a Saturday night (which works for me) - we got served right away. Food - appetizer had the kyufta-bozbash soup - amazing (lamb meatball). Tried the khinkali - not impressed but not bad nevertheless. Main dishes were amazing - had the chanaki (veal stew with meat so tender it melted in your mouth) and the lamb lula kebob (arguably one of the tastiest kabobs I ever had). Being eastern european myself I really appreciate stews and kabobs and believe me I was not disappointed. Closest stew I had to my grandma's (which I used to enjoy when I was back home). Almost brought a tear to my eye. Drinks - Georgian wine, semi-sweet for girlfriend and dry full bodied for myself. Good wines but $9/glass. A bit of a ripoff. For $15 you get the full bottle at the LCBO. Overall scores: Food - 5/5 - for what I care - this is the reason I came and was not disappointed Drinks - 2/5 - good wine but really overpriced Price - 3/5 - stick to the food only and you can escape with around $20-30/person (appetizer and main). The moment you touch drinks the bill rings up FAST Cleanliness - 5/5 - very clean Decor - 4/5 - simple but gets the job done. The restaurant knows what it wants Ambiance - 2/5 - was almost empty when we came around 9:30 PM on a Saturday. We were the last customers around 10:30PM but never felt rushed or anything. Service - 5/5 - smile on their face and they looked to be the owners, fast and friendly They prefer cash and have an ATM in there - did not seem to accept credit cards.  Loved the experience, would definitely go back more often if not for the price."}
{"text":"I called Aragvi at 4:30 asking if they had space for 4 people at 6:30 (Friday same night). The lady kindly called me back and said there was a table, but we would have to be out by 8:30...wow, popular place!  And I can see why! This restaurant is sooo small! The room can only fit about 4-5 tables, and we got the one right by the entrance. No problem! I was already excited to try this cute and quaint restaurant. I have a Georgian friend so I was doubly excited to try some of her country's dishes!  There are two ladies who do everything from taking orders to bringing orders. The one who served us was so kind and \"mum-like.\" I came here with my boyfriend and his parents and we had no idea what to order. The hostess suggested we order an Appetizer Sharing plate which came with samples of: Beets (YUM!), Eggplant (Babaganouj) (YUM!), some Walnut paste thing (it was good but too much Walnut in my opinion), and some grilled peppers.  We also had some bread (they bake everything in house) and a cheese-like croissant which was really good (but heavy!). For mains, I had a stew with hearty veal and potatoes.  For booze, they have Georgian Wines so it's a good chance to try  Overall, I would love to come back here. Everything is just so homey - I felt as if I was at my friend's house and her mom was cooking for me. Everything is made fresh and in-house and the food is really good. This cuisine is not something you get every day, so if you want to try something new, I would highly recommend this place.  As with all the other reviews, this restaurant is located in a small plaza, so parking can be tight at times.   They do not accept credit cards, so I would bring cash. Dinner for 4 people was very reasonable for all the good and full-food we got. Highly recommend (and don't forget to make reservations! It's an absolute must)."}
{"text":"First off I would like to say that the atmosphere outside the restaurant is very different compared to the inside. Outside is dark and sketchy, with windows you can't see into, while inside, it kind of reminds me of a dining room, just with several tables.  Went here for my friend's birthday, and I ordered the cornish hen.I would have to say it was very mediocre. It came with potato wedges as well as a cucumber and tomato salad. Nothing special about the two sides. My biggest gripe was with the cornish hen, because it was way to over seasoned. Not only was it too salty, but my breath still tastes like intense garlic 3 hrs after the dinner. However, I did like the portioning of the dishes. It was the 'just right' type of portion, where you don't have to force feed yourself to finish the dish, and you won't have to go home scavenging for snacks either.   Overall, I'd say this is a decent restaurant, but nothing spectacular about it to make me want to return on a regular basis. It is also quite a trek to get here from scarborough, so i will likely opt to save the gas money."}
{"text":"Oh wow, what a delicious place!  My brother and I stopped in here after a workout. At first, I balked since the place was set up all nice and some of the diners were quite well dressed. We were in our sweats. Not a problem, we were seated and given menus. Everything looked amazing and we ended up ordering a couple of Georgian dishes: the lamb shish kebab and the veal stew. The lamb came first with a nice salad and dill-tossed roasted potatoes. Holy cow, it was all INCREDIBLE. The potatoes, especially. I could have eaten a million of them.  Next came the veal stew, which was meaty, rich and flavourful and came with soft, fresh bread slices. Another triumph! It was also super tasty and my brother and I kind of lost our minds eating.   Service was very very friendly and despite the warning on the menu that the food may take a while, since everything is made fresh from scratch, it was only about a 15 minute wait for our meals (to be fair, we were the last people to show up and everyone else there was at the tail end of their meals).   As a plus, the server/owner(?) has a son that is also allergic to dairy, so she knew straight off what had dairy and what didn't.  Our meal came to about $33 with the tip added in the receipt (only 10%. Of course we tipped more.) Not bad considering we stuffed ourselves silly. I can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"This small restaurant is in a plaza that you probably would never come to unless you had to. Its quite a hidden gem, and I was pleased that we came here for dinner on a Friday night.   Upon walking in, we thought that there was a private function.  They had chair covers on on all the chairs and napkins in the glasses. It seemed very done up.  But turns out this is their regular decor.   Despite trying to hard to impress, the food speaks for itself.  It's Georgian food, somewhere between Middle Eastern, mix of Armenian, Russian, Israeli and probably other cuisines i'm not privvy to.  We ordered a lot of food, and be wary that the portions are generaous.   The Lamb Meatball soup and Harcho was really tasty.  Harcho was a mix of braised lamb chunks, in a tomato like broth and with lots of ciltranto and spices. I liked it a lot.  We also go one of the pastries. (the 2nd one on the menu)  The difference between this and the first one on the menu, the 2nd one is very flaky and filled with gooey cheese. The 1st one is a lot more dense. I would recommend the 2nd one (sorry I forget the name).   We also had the Eggplant Roll, it was okay, but tasted like a cold sloppy joe. I think it was just the texture.   The kebobs come at a good price, and lots of food. The Armenian potatoes were my favourite. I know that sounds really simplistic, but they were crunch on the outside and soft on the side. So tasty! The lamb lula is a minced meat version of the lamb kebob.   I also had the Veal Stew which I really liked. It was a curry like texture, with soft meats, but I felt like I needed rice with it.   The food is great, but it's the decor and atmosphere that needs to be improved. The folks that come here know the staff and it's like one big family, and unless you're used to that, you might feel out of place."}
{"text":"\"We would recommend this place for a taste of something different. The restaurant is popular with locals (it was full at some point of the evening even on Thursday night) and the food is aplenty. The dishes are heavier than usual on average, but make for a great dinner alternative. One more option is to order some takeout to try it out prior to plunging all in. \" \"The simple menus are loaded with traditional Georgian dishes as well as some more conservative options like house, Greek or Caesar salads. Our waitress attended to us promptly and provided some suggestions to start. She assumed we can speak Russian - a small community restaurant we thought. We chose the appetizer platter and a large hachapuri (cheese pastry).\"  This is just a bite of our full review.."}
{"text":"Don't let the sketchy looking plaza scare you away - this little gem, Georgian restaurant serves absolutely delicious meals and its atmosphere within the restaurant is warm and welcoming.   I heard about this restaurant through yelp, while frantically looking for a good restaurant in north Toronto. So happy I did!  What I had: (all prepared very nicely, and I was stuffed!) Izpanahi (Georgian spinach salad with ground walnut, spices & herbs. Penovani Hachapuri (cheese bread made with puff dough) Khinkali (large Georgian style perogies with seasoned minced meat with salt & pepper)  Service: very friendly! Although - I would bring cash and change next time, because their debit card reading terminal wasn't working, they don't accept credit cards.  and they didn't have any change in their cash register.  This was a bit annoying...I'm sure this was just a rare case.  Atmosphere: I came here on a Tuesday night when it was freezing outside, at 7.30pm. The restaurant could probably fit about 20-25 people. We were the only customers there that dined. Warm and cute.  Would I come here again? If I lived around the neighborhood, yes."}
{"text":"A small little georgian place you'd never know about if it wasn't for yelp. I had high hopes for this place, based on having a great experience at a georgian restaurant I frequented back when I lived in San Diego.   Atmosphere-wise it's nothing to write home about. All the other clientele in the place was of russian origin. Clearly this is where natives go to try and get a taste of home. Of course, I have no idea how faithful a re-creation it is.  It was decent. We started with a beat salad. I was really looking forward to that. They prepare it with pomegranates and cilantro - it has a really nice bite to it. It did not disappoint. We then ordered a traditional home-style type dish that had chantrelly-type mushrooms and onions fried with potato slices. I thought it was good but not great. My russian friend said it really reminded her of home. For the main course I had a beef/lamb kebab plate. The meat was a bit dry and lacked the flavour I was hoping. I was looking forward to the side sauce that comes with the meat, and It was just not that great. Kind of a flavourless hot sauce. I was hoping for some wacky pomegranate tangy sauce.   I might go there again sometime."}
{"text":"First time visit in their new location . We didn't like the location , music was loud ( we were told that another table asked to play their cd) , service was lousy, food didn't impress anyone, Aragvi used to be much better place.... We were told after the meal  that credit card machine doesn't work... Wine is too expensive. I prefer new Georgian place on Steels called Suliko, more flavor, cheaper and they always welcome you with bread basket and some specialty sauces."}
{"text":"What a fantastic gem!  Is it me, or is it pretty consistent that fantastic ethnic cuisine is best had from dodgy strip mall locations?  What is Georgian cuisine first of all?  To me it feels like a mix between Russian, Eastern European with a bit of middle-easter influence.    The small restaurant was quite empty at lunch time when we went, but that did not matter.  Our host was friendly and very helpful with helping us navigate as Georgian cuisine newbies.  The food was fantastic.  We had a flavourful lamb meatball soup, followed by the dumplings.  The dumplings are way bigger than I imagined, so i would estimate two per person is enough.  They are a cross between pelmini and Shanghainese \"shiao lung bao\" in my mind.  Steamed with a thick chewy skin, and a meaty filling with a hot tasty broth.  We had their bread baked with cheese with a coddled egg in the middle.  We were instructed to mix up the egg and dip the bread.  The bread was super delicious, hot and chewy with a crunchy crust.  Finally we also had a veal stew.  The veal stew was fragrant and thick with eggplant.  We practically licked the bowl!  Our first time here will definitely not be the last!  Looking forward to trying out the many things on the many."}
{"text":"This place is literally across the street from my apartment building, so we decided to venture in as we've been in the area a few months now.   As mentioned in other reviews the decor, seating, and even outside of the restaurant are not the most appealing. However, with that said the food was excellent. While some of the spices on the meats were foreign to our pallet so to speak, we did enjoy everything and will definitely return again.   Also as pointed out, there definitely is a local atmosphere here where many of the customers inside seemed to be regularls (this included Eastern Europeans, but Asians as well which surprised me). For anyone looking to try something different, I would definitely recommend this if you are in the area."}
