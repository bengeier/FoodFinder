{"text":"Amazing Dragon eye sushi the place is ran by Vietnamese folks but they can make a great Sushi roll in killer time. The price is a little higher than other places but I would recommend this place if you have the funds for your tongue!"}
{"text":"I was craving some sushis... So I got the 18 pieces combo with a miso soup (veggie)! It was super fresh :)) i would recommend if you are in the area"}
{"text":"Excellent! Les sushis sont toujours frais et délicieux. La salade du chef est vraiment bonne. La livraison est un peu lente, mais ça vaut vraiment la peine. Service courtois et sympathique."}
{"text":"Been going to that place since it opened, then took about a year's break, and when I got the same rolls I always ordered, I noticed there was way less of actual fish/shrimp/scallop in there, and way more veggies and rice... Oh well... It was still delicious and still freshly made as always, I'll still chose that place over any other sushi take-out in that 10 mile radius."}
{"text":"This is a good, standard sushi place in an area that definitely needed one (the neighbouring competition mostly consists of fast-food restaurant chains). I got the 18 piece lunch combo ($12.95) and quite enjoyed it, and would recommend it if you happen to be nearby. Best for delivery or take out, as the space inside is tiny (only a couple of tables) and not very nice-looking."}
{"text":"I've had sushi from so many different places: like Houston,Texas: Toronto, New York. And Rabu sushi takes the cake every time. It's fresh, affordable, and delicious. A must try for people who have yet to try it!"}
