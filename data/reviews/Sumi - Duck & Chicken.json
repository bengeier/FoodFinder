{"text":"I tried the GamJaTang for two people. The flavor was good and there was so much meat that I was able to bring some home. Their side dishes were also well presented. The waitresses are kind and attentive. I am also satisfied with the reasonable price! I will visit again this winter and eat the hot soup."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been here for several times and every food I tried was all GOOD.
And btw it changed its name to SUMI."}
{"text":"I love this place Been there twice now. Service was really good - esp the older waitress was so nice to me, reminded of my mom lol. She even brought me songpyun (traditional rice cake) which wasnt part of banchan dishes because it was Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving). 

Food is not too salty or greasy. Quality of banchans and meat was very good. I like how menu only presents what this restaurant specializes in - duck and chicken!  (I dont like how most Korean restaurants in Toronto offer gazillion dishes with mediocre quality)
 
Id say this place is quite similar to what you would expect from regular restaurants in Seoul in general. In terms of atmosphere and vibe, its more family friendly. 

Also this place is new so no waittime! Piggy's on the other side made me wait for 45mins.. but this place, you get seats right away and my food came out pretty fast! 

Price was average. But then when you compare with other K bbq restaurants, its few bucks cheaper here. And def alot cheaper than ssam, piggys, and daldongnae considering the amount of banchan dishes and meat portion you get.

I recommend marinated duck bbq. You can ask your server to make fried rice after you finish your bbq for extra few dollars. 
Smoked duck bbq is also good for those who are trying to cut down calories (less fat and you eat smoked duck with alot of veggies) - but not recommendable for big eaters. 
(+i also tried duck skewers. It was a bit too salty for me.)

Overall, this place reminds me of restaurants in Korea. So much better than those overpriced low quality Korean restaurants near yonge and finch."}
{"text":"DUCK + BBQ? Count me in!!! I've been meaning to look for a joint that serves up something other than your usual selection of meat. 

First off, the duck comes cooked and has a smoky flavour that you can grill to warm up. What really caught my attention about this place was the fact that you can get creative with your wraps - in a healthy way too!!! The sides come with perilla leaves, seasoned radish, cabbage, peppers and onions. The herby taste of the perilla leaves definitely eliminates the greasiness of the duck and the seasoned radish gives off some zest as well. 

We also ordered the infamous chicken & cheese dish. The dish is served in a pan that's over a portable gas stove because it doesn't fit on the grill itself. It wasn't anything special and had a lot of cabbage. However, it was well-seasoned and it wasn't as spicy as other places I've tried, which made it a bit easier to eat. I would've definitely preferred for more rice cakes and cheese tho!!! Regardless, it's best to stick to what they specialize in. 

In terms of service, we went during off-peak hours so it was basically empty when we got there. Needless to say, the servers were very friendly and helpful in showing us the ropes for how to eat the BBQ duck."}
{"text":"A clean, well-ventilated space. The servers delivered our order quickly--we ordered the half spicy marinated duck and fried rice--and cooked it for us. They also brought us complimentary soup. The server cautioned us to scoot away from the burner to avoid the oil-popping mess, but a few orange oil splashed got my arm. Definitely wear dark clothes to avoid any stains. 

The spicy marinated duck fell on the mild side, but was still packed with tasty sweet, savoury flavours. I really enjoyed eating the duck's fatty, soft skin. The fried rice rounded out the whole meal--my favourite part of the meal."}
{"text":"Delicious Korean food with a twist! The restaurant is famous for their deliciously wholesome duck soup and chicken soup. The food is of a higher quality than many Korean restaurants in the area. Most notably, they add traditional herbs and spices to their soups. These herbs and spices make you feel all warm inside during a cold winter's day. Their side dishes are also quite different and change quite often. I haven't had the same set of side dishes since I started going to this restaurant. The staff is also quite nice."}
{"text":"Found this new place on Yelp and decided to give it a try!
The place is nicely renovated. Service was really good here.
We tried the duck soup and chicken noodle soup. Both tasted blend at first but after putting in some sea salt (comes on the side), the flavours came out. 

Really enjoyed the meal and will come back next time!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant on Friday and found it randomly as the wait for another nearby korean bbq place was way too busy. I am glad we found it though!
Very cute, quiet restaurant. Decor is nice and equipment seems to be new. Really sucks that the restaurant is a bit hidden in a plaza so it's hard to notice or get more recognition especially because there's other more well-known places near by. 
Food quality was good and price decent.
We ordered ~2lbs of pork belly in which the waitress (probably owner) grilled for us! And a bulgogi with rice to share. 
It came with lots of side dishes and not your typical ones as well. 
We got 2x the side dishes as we couldn't get enough. 
Service was great as well."}
{"text":"Just like their name; simple & classy!  Simply delicious and the best comfort food in Thornhill! There must be one thing I was surprised they didn't have, seafood pancake wasn't on the menu, maybe they only serve meat here? However, the name of the place says it all I guess, duck & chicken,but I ordered pork bone soup (maybe their name should be duck&chicken&pork ;) and their amazing ginseng chicken soup.  The verdict: their smoked duck salad is very good and refreshing (pricey but can share with at least w/ 4 people), and don't miss out on thr ginseng chicken soup for sure!! This place also has a very private dining room suitable for family dinner or table for 8+. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"This place has been in business for 6 months.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. We had the duck bbq. $25 for two people. Super good and super healthy.  The owner even came over and gave us some more salad for free.

The ambience is nice, service is prompt and friendly.

I only wish they had draft maekjoo."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to try this place out, so we went there on a Saturday night. The food itself was good. We had the half duck and pork belly BBQ combo. But the three of us agreed that it wasn't quite enough for us to be full (the menu said the combo serves 3-4). Perhaps they could add a stew or at least a bowl of rice to the combo? Maybe we're just pigs...
Aside from that, while the owner was super nice and tried very hard to impress us, I couldn't say the same about the wait staff, who seemed uninterested in serving us. It took us like 10 minutes just to flag someone down to refill our tea, and it wasn't super busy. I hope they can work on this aspect a bit more, but we still left satisfied."}
{"text":"Before coming here, I had actually gone to another restaurant nearby. I walked in and after a few minutes, nobody greeted me. I walked in a little farther, checked out their buffet, which looked a little sparse, and still nobody greeted me. I left without seeing any staff in sight.

My trusty Yelp app showed several restaurants in the area and Duck & Chicken piqued my interest. I didn't know at the time that it was a Korean restaurant. No problem. I love Korean food and I love duck!

After looking over the menu, I discovered that they serve duck and chicken. Hey, no surprises here! Just sarcasm. I ordered the Korean Duck Soup, with an open mind, not knowing what to expect. I love soup!

I received a boiling hot bowl of soup, still bubbling as it arrived at my table. What I wasn't expecting was all the side dishes that came with it - seven in total, including rice. Nice! I love the side dishes that are usually served with Korean food, I just wasn't expecting it with a bowl of soup. That makes this meal a really good value!

There was duck and potatoes in the soup, and spices that reminded me of Korean Pork Bone Soup (one of my favourites), just toned down a bit. It was good but I prefer the bolder pork version. Did I like it? Yes. Did I love it? Not as much as I thought I would. Would I order it again? Not sure. Would I come back? Maybe, but to try other dishes, maybe their table BBQ."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night for dinner and the restaurant was almost empty -most likely because they are newly opened. The store owner (older Asian lady) was really nice to us, when we told her that we were there for a birthday, she offered us free pop! 

We ordered a whole marinated duck BBQ along with the shabu shabu (for 2 people) and the chicken soup (for 2 people - they use the entire chicken) it was a decent size to feed 6 people. 

The soup is a little bland, from what i heard it's because the do not use MSG. 

You wrap all your meat with cabbage and a thin slice of radish - all really healthy!! 

Afterwards, you can either opt for the noodles or the porridge. I would recommend the porridge, it's purple rice with a raw egg and seaweed mixed into the soup which gives you a porridge/congee texture. 

One good thing is that the servers are always really proactive in helping you cook your dishes and refilling your side dishes. One note on the side dishes is that they don't serve Kim chi, which I find a little weird."}
{"text":"Specialized in duck and chicken. It's something different and it was super tasty. Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"I love Korean food and have been to Korea many times where I've sampled many great Korean dishes. I wasn't expecting much from this restaurant as it looked like a hole in the wall generic Korean restaurant. However, the experience vastly exceeded my expectations! Service was great (rare in my experience at Korean restaurants in TO), dishes were authentic and not something you can find everywhere (e.g., bibimbap w/ duck, chicken porridge), everything was clean and fresh, and it was great value! Will come here again and recommend to all my friends, both Korean and Non-Korean."}
{"text":"Accidental surprises are great.  And admittedly...I had no intention going to this restaurant.  
Wait....wait, let me explain myself.

I was actually supposed to go to the nearby Korean restaurant that specializes in cold noodles with a friend, but there was no parking in their respective parking lot and if I attempted to park at the parking (where Duck & Chicken is located), there were signs of doom saying my car would be towed if I LEFT THE PARKING LOT.

So...funny enough, I remained in that parking lot, and was very close to going to Paramount Fine Foods (in the same plaza/parking lot).  But I saw \"Duck & Chicken\", and since I love duck....I was like, screw it, let's just do this, rather surprise myself than go for something I've already had (and usually not to rave reviews).

I should do this more often.

So this place wasn't too busy since it was a bit after lunch, but we were greeted and seated (you know the standards).  As we reviewed the menu, sure there was the typical Gamjatang and Haemul Paejeon, but why go there for the basic Korean dishes, you go for their specialties!  I went straight to their feature items, Duck and Chicken.  So this place offers duck and chicken in a few formats, and we opted for smoked duck KBBQ (typically authentic KBBQ is mainly pork or beef).  We changed tables so that we had the hotplate to do a bit of grilling.

Service was decent, considering on off-peak times, the waitress could manage the customers inside.  She gave us brief instructions on how to eat the duck, since my friend and I were a tad clueless. 

So the food, right off the bat, the banchan (side dishes) is delicious,SO good.  Star banchan? Their eggplant.  Perfectly cooked (not hard or overly mushy), with a new soy sauce, sesame oil and crispy bits of garlic on top?  Their kimchi and sliced odeng were good as well. Got a 2nd round of banchan while we're at it, free of charge.

The main duck platter, comprised of smoked duck (which appeared to be cooked, but to be warmed on the grilled), shredded cabbage, bell peppers and onions.  And then on the side there was a plate of perilla leaves (gaenip) and circular pickled white radish (moo).  It was such a fun lil experience to take these ingredients and make little wraps out of them.  Perhaps I just like meals that don't always have to involve chopsticks, a fork or a spoon. Oh, and we got our own individual salads, which was pretty much a mound of cabbage and few other vegetables, but a nice tangy vinegar based dressing.  The meat was good, partially my fault for slightly over cooking the duck, but I wouldn't say it was mind-blowingly out of this world.  Considering that it's smoked duck, \"smoked\" just has a certain flavour which goes across any protein.  Smoked turkey leg is what comes to mind.  

Overall, great meal, a semi-unique restaurant offering, my final words for this place is to show off their strengths (Duck & Chicken).  If there are other Korean styles to cook duck & chicken, they ought make that their selling point.  But if I'm ever in the area, I'll bring more friends over to this place :)

Accidental surprises FTW."}
{"text":"Very good service. It's not like other Korean restaurant.. they mainly serve duck and chicken. Very tasty and I like their smoke duck BBQ the best. Speed is fast and very nice environment with light music.. recommended for couples who awanna have a decent dinner together.. price is reasonable"}
{"text":"I have been to Duck & Chicken a few times. It specializes in duck (and chicken) dishes; you can get duck soup with rice, duck (spicy, marinated, smoked) BBQ. I especially love the duck BBQ where you can get unlimited veggies refills.

Next time, I will try the spicy duck hot pan which you can pay extra to get fried rice with seaweeds.

Service was friendly and prompt. The staff would cook the meat for you like most of the authentic Korean BBQ.

Don't forget to get a free Korean coffee; there is a self-serve machine at the entrance."}
{"text":"Came here with a big group of friends ~ 12 people so we ordered 2 group sets each approx $45 each trying their specialty dishes: chicken and duck.
One was the kbbq duck & pork style, which was cooked in their korean spicy sauce which was very flavorful. The meat was tender too. They served radish for you to wrap the meat, along with the cabbage and onions in soy sauce all together. Tasty!

The other group set was the chicken soup. The set comes with 2 full chickens. The soup was cooked with just the chicken and a few green onions and rice cakes so it was not that flavorful and slightly bland but had a clean taste to it. After 2 servings of the full chicken, the staff came back to make the porridge, which was adding purple rice mixing it into the leftover soup. The porridge was really flavorful, with all the soup soaked in.

We also ordered the smoked duck which was really good. It was a huge platter filled with pieces of smoked duck, you then grill the smoked duck on the bbq grill. The idea is to use the radish to wrap the duck and cabbage and onions in soy sauce all together. 

One thing that was good was the staff comes and cooks the food for you so you don't have to worry about it at all. Also, I love how they were very generous with the side dishes. Not sure if it was because we were a large group but instead of taking our side dish plates to refill, they came with the original big containers where they store their side dishes to fill our plates and loaded up our side dish plates. All their side dishes were delicious!"}
{"text":"I was never really a firm believer in \"Hole in the Walls\" because most people have probably already found them... But oddly, there's Duck and Chicken. 

I'll be honest, I was originally planning on going to Cho Sun Ok for their Gamjatang, but turned around after looking at the crowded line up. Duck and Chicken is literally one intersection nearby. To our surprise, when the wife and I went in, only one table was filled. My thoughts were, \"Oh boy I'm not too sure about this place.\"

I'm glad I was wrong though.

Firstly, side dishes: VERY different selection than most Korean restaurants. Eggplant, Burdock root, Mashed pumpkin, White (Water) Kimchi (named after its white, clear appearance), broccoli with hot pepper paste and... the regular Kimchi. My favourite was the mashed pumpkin! Sweet and really helps mellow the spiciness.

We ordered the family size Gamjatang and for about $25 dollars, it was totally worth its price. I had enough for 3 days worth of lunch afterwards! Their Gamjatang didn't have any potatoes, but that's okay. The huge pot was full of pork bone meat! Chock full of flavour - I can probably even say it's on par with Cho Sun Ok.

This place deserves more love. Check it out, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not quite yet established in terms of service and management. The severs were literally running across the small resto yet service felt so slow. They weren't even that busy, maybe 6 tables max.. The food was also mediocre. Piggy has so much better value food. My review is based on duck roast (half of which was fat) and the portion was very small and bland. They are quick to burn as well... I'd go elsewhere if you're truly craving Korean BBQ. This place could be better for other entrees but I don't think I'm going back"}
{"text":"Duck & Chicken specialized in duck and chicken.

Nothing fusion or instagram worthy or new and trendy here. If you are looking for traditional Korean cooking which has health benefits, you won't be disappointed.

Duck and chicken used here are fresh and never frozen, Cooked as soup, stew, hot pot with herbs that would enhanced your health. There are a few spicy dish too as spicy is good for balancing your system too.

Korean Style Duck Soup and Chicken Noodle Soup both has a clean taste but full of flavour. Nothing beat a rich aromatic chicken soup on a cold rainy day. Banchan has that healthier lighter taste too.

Lunch Special is a $1 or 2 cheaper than during dinner but I like how they have smaller individual portion.

I would be back to try out other table cooking items during dinner time with some friends. Sharing is caring!!"}
{"text":"I know their specialty is their duck and chicken but I have to say the gamjatang (pork bone soup) hotpot was the highlight for me. Flavours were on point, portions were generous (we must have counted 8-9 bones) for $25.99, and the servers were so attentive in refilling our side dishes! The only downfall of the meal was their seafood pancake. While it was tasty in its own right, it also lacked much seafood for what you pay for. I'll definitely come back again to try their chicken noodle soup, we could smell the aroma from other tables and we were so tempted to order! 

Also, the only thing that is confusing is their restaurant name is titled Sumi, not Duck & Chicken."}
{"text":"Came to have something different for once (not pork or beef) and seems cool that they specialize in duck and chicken dishes. We ordered the spicy duck bbq set for 2 (ie. half a duck)  and we were both pretty full by the end of it. The set included around 6 side dishes, some spring onion pancakes, and seaweed soup (these may change). 

Everything was well seasoned (not too salty) and delicious (that mashed sweet potato side dish was sooooooo gooooddd). 

I'll definitely come again and try their other dishes. The only regret I had was not telling the waitress we wanted to add the stir fry rice option ($2, you can use some of the leftover meat and sauce to stir fry with rice) in the beginning. Because of that mistake, they gave us a different type of grill so we couldn't try it. Next time!"}
{"text":"I went to check out this place based on good Yelp review, was a bit disappointed. I thought this is just a regular Korean restaurant, however it is a bbq restaurant and has strong bbq smell which I always want to avoid. 
I ordered chicken noodle soup, the menu doesn't mention anywhere it was SPICY, it was too spicy for me. It had a few tiny little piece of chicken inside. Service wasn't good either, was being ignored for a while. Won't go back."}
