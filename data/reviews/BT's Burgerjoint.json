{"text":"Best burger I've had in a while. Made to order burger...however you want it cooked, whatever topping, etc. It is extremely reasonably priced as well with a decent beer selection. I've been searching for a decent burger joint outside of Charlotte and I found it!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, custom prepared \"burgers\" and more!.

Friday night-  8:00pm, dinner

Food:  Outstanding, freshly made burgers to order. Choose your toppings, sauces, sides and more. Although their hamburgers are great, we absolutely love the turkey burgers. Best turket burgers we have had around here and are freshly made to order. You can order it with a lettuce wrap instead of a roll for those who would like a healthier option,  

Service: Great. Although you do not get table service like a traditional restaurant. Floor managers and servers come by occasionally asking how things are and if you need anything. That is plenty good for us for a place like this. When done dining you leave your dishes on the table. We usually leave a couple of bucks. 

Price: Reasonable prices for drinks and sides and you get what you pay for. Expect to pay about $6-7 for a burger.   

Other: You start off by entering the restaurant and picking up a menu. Then you proceed to the counter to place your order. You get an order number and a server brings out your order when it is ready. If it's your first time there, you might get a little confused. They also serve beer but we have never seen anyone drinking. Also, there is an outdoor seating area for when the weather is nice, Finally, there are TVs setup with sports to watch, 

Tip: Go there with a coupon. Coupons are plentiful and use them. Repeat- go there with a coupon. We found a coupon online that had a buy one burger get one free deal. Awesome!

A great place to go before or after the movies.."}
{"text":"Have enjoyed BT's fresh burgers at other locations for a couple of years so we were excited to see one open in Sun Valley.  I appreciate the level of customization available.  Quality is at a high level and consistent."}
{"text":"Food is ok, prices are way overpriced!!  Location is good though. Went here after watching a movie and it was a nice night to sit outside.  Onion rings were good and the fried pickles were ok."}
{"text":"So disappointed!   We just relocated here last month and we were so excited to have found this great place.  We have eaten here once or twice a week since. Came today and was so let down to find that the fresh cut fries have been replaced with frozen fries!!!  They also had no craft beer for my hubby. To the company who bought out the place...give us back the good fries!  That is a deal breaker for me!  We will drive to other burger places in search of great fries, even if we have to drive further!"}
{"text":"Great burgers! Fried are good; beer...And music!
Sports on, great service. In a great location near the movie theatre. The decorations are spot on.
A little pricy for a cheeseburger with ketchup and mustard only. Still good though. I would recommend this place; good place for teens to hang. Safe area."}
{"text":"Have always enjoyed BT's, but we go there for our daughter who is vegan. Today we learn they discontinued the black bean burger... What a let down for all families with a vegan member!
I do wish them continued success, and I'm sure the $150 to $200 a month our once a week visits made won't be missed!!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? Overpriced by far. Decided to stay and give it a try from reviews. I ordered the featured fish sandwich, $7.95, my husband the pretzel bacon cheeseburger, $7.95, regular onion rings (5 total) $2.50 and two unsweetened tea at $2.09 each. Many tables were dirty so I cleaned one off myself. When small fish sandwich came the bun was very toasted but cold. Fish was greasy and small. My husbands sandwich and bun were very greasy. Staff were friendly and I let one know that my sandwich was not good, and will be writing a review. Manager came to table and apologized and offered a coupon for a free sandwich. I said thanks, but will not use or return. Save your money and try someplace else."}
{"text":"They are merging with American Burger Co.. This is very disappointing. I loved BTs, but ABC not so much. Will not be back!"}
{"text":"was ready for a great burger....didnt happen..it was ok.but with all the choices close by...not much better than hwy 55 save your money"}
{"text":"This place may not be know for their salads but damn they are good, and the manager on second shift, Tawan or as they call him around the restaurant, \"T\" is very good at what he does and is always kind and when our order was taken wrong he went out of his way to make sure we didn't leave unsatisfied.."}
{"text":"Delicious.  You've gotta try this place.  Burger was a good big portion and sooooo tasty!  Took a bit as it is cooked to order but so worth it.  If you want a side, skip the fries (too dry) and get the onion rings instead... although you'll be too full from the burger itself to eat something else."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here shortly after the restaurant opened.  It was a delightful experience!  The restaurant features hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, hotdogs, and salads... All of which you can get quick picks such as \"the American\" and \"Sunny Side Up\" burgers, & \"Carolina Dog\", or as \"Make Your Own\".  Gluten-free buns are available for an extra $2.  They also feature a plethora of different bottled beers and also a beer on tap and wine selection.  The burger and dog we had were delicious, as were the sweet potato fries.  Kids Meals were served with soda or milk, French fries or frozen grapes, and a scoop of ice cream with sprinkles.  Prices are higher than McDonalds, at around $9 -$10 for a meal with side and fountain drink, and averaging around $5.50 for a kids meal, but the food is well worth it.  The burgers are large and the meat lean and tasty.  The sweet potato fries are to die for, being drizzled with honey and butter!  I also can't wait to try a \"Make Your Own\" salad, as the choices are awesome and plentiful.  This is an appropriate place for a business lunch as well, as the restaurant is very clean.  You order your food from the counter and your meal is brought to you, and you get your own drink, so minimal if any tipping is expected.  This restaurant is definitely worth a try if you haven't yet had the pleasure!"}
{"text":"Tried BT's for the first before a movie. I had an Um burger and asked for pepper jack instead of the American cheese, charged me .75 extra.  The cashier did not mention at time of order, .... Really $.75 extra??   My wife had the turkey burger and it was greasey, how does that happen?  My burger was very \"juicey\" which seemed greasey to me as well. (Ordered well done).  French fries were not hot and a little soft as if been sitting for a while.  Probably not eating there again, would rather have a 5 Guys burger and fries."}
{"text":"I wanted a good burger, and I think this is the closest place to where I live that does \"burgers\" as opposed to everything under the sun.

Burger came out a little under for my liking.  Also a little thick.  It's hard to eat something bigger than your head.  Very tasty and fresh toppings, lots of good choices for building your own.

Bonus points for serving beer.  While the selection seems large, almost all are from large breweries. :/  Try serving up something local! :)

Extra bonus points for home made hot sauce at the table!"}
{"text":"First time here. Had the quick burger with fries. They have a great beer selection and my wife says the sweet tea was good. Price is fair with it being a cafeteria style Resturant. Service was good, employees were friendly."}
{"text":"Consistently great turkey burger. Probably a good thing I don't live close by or I'd eat there once a week."}
{"text":"Food was average but way overpriced! $30 for a burger with sweet potato fries and a coke and a cheese steak with onion rings and beer. They had flies all over the place which was really annoying while were trying to eat! I was impressed with the beer selection. Not worth the cost for food though."}
{"text":"Had never even heard of BT's Burgerjoint before. Was in the area visiting a beloved aunt. To be honest, she had planned on taking me out to eat at a local restaurant that turned out to be closed for remodeling at that time. Hmmm, she said, I know where we'll go. I didn't ask...kinda looked forward to where she'd choose. Well, when we turned into the lot, thought, well, we're going to Moe's Grill. An ok place to eat. But, when we kept on riding right past Moe's, and parked right in front of bt's Burgerjoint, I got happy! 'Tain't had a good burger in ages! To make a long story short--this place serves fantastic burgers on buns I believe they bake themselves, great fries, they even have good sweet tea...a rare thing at ANY burger place! To my aunt and BT's--love ya both and will be back to visit both of ya soon!!"}
{"text":"Ok, the vibe in this place is awesome! Open seating , open kitchen and lots of happy team members ! If Panera and Five guys had a baby then it would be named BT's burger joint. They also serve beer and wine. This is an added bonus for the sports enthusiast that want to watch the game on one if there several TV's. Outside porch gives you a great view of the line going into the theatre. If you like people watching, then you found a great place to sit. 
The food would have sealed the deal if it was cooked properly. My burger came out cold in the middle. I don't mind undercooked meat, but this was literally raw in the middle. The sweet tea also  had that sour taste like maybe the urn hadn't been cleaned.  Fried pickles were great , but some of them were stuck together and still doughy. The BT's sauce was amazing! Must try it on their fries.  
  I have found a great place to grab a beer and watch the game , but I may have to get my burger next door if I have this same experience next time."}
{"text":"My family and I went with a group of friends on Sunday night.  Here it is Wed and I am still thinking about the pretzel burger.  It was the best burger I have had in a long time.  It was perfectly cooked and the fried pickles were also delicious.  We will absolutely be going back."}
{"text":"A little wait for my burger. Seems like 8 mins for a burger no fries. My experience is still good on a rainy day. When my burger arrived looks like it was cooked medium like I asked. Tastes like five guys a little bit,decent burger. The bt sauce on the table adds a better version of the Hornets burger I ordered. I like bacon with my burger comes with the hornets burger."}
{"text":"The food, customization, location, and overall atmosphere is great! The manager dropped by during our visit and made sure everything was satisfactory! You don't see that very often. My only complaint is about the price. While the food isn't outrageously expensive, it is a bit more than expected for a burger place. I will return!"}
{"text":"BT's Burger Joint is perfect for conquering that cheeseburger craving that hits you from time to time. My goal is to try a different burger each time I go. Above Average burgers!!! Great environment for a sit down burger."}
{"text":"Great service, awesome beer selection!  Food was excellent!!  Can't go wrong here, great American fare!"}
{"text":"We decided to go for an impromptu lunch and wanted to try the new burger joint. When we first walked in we were greeted with a sign that said to take a menu, choose your items and be ready to order. A little abrupt but it does cut down on the wait to order. I was pleasantly surprised by the decor which was very laid back featuring bright colors and even a surfboard. They had outdoor seating which looks out onto the courtyard next to a water fountain. Very relaxing atmosphere. There was an open kitchen, very clean and the staff was very friendly. The menu was easy to follow and had a section to build your own burger or salad....nice to have choices. I ordered the regular burger cooked medium and it was done perfectly. The fries were good, fried pickles could have used a little seasoning and the onion rings were flavorless. Overall, nice atmosphere...good burgers but the sides need some help."}
{"text":"I just finished lunch here on my first ever visit to BT's. The food was pretty good I had a burger and tater tots but the customer service was terrible and it wasn't just to me I thought to other customers as well. the girl who was the cashier and also the food runner was very short with conversation to the point that it was nearly rude bringing food out to the table and just saying \"here\" and then walking away. After that I saw her go behind the counter still were you can see her and make a milkshake start consuming the milkshake and then walking with the milkshake tin while eating from it with a spoon. The manager next to her did not seem to care that she was eating on the line in front of the entire restaurant to see. I worked in restaurants for nearly 20 years and her behavior is just unacceptable. the food was okay that I might return but probably not to this location."}
{"text":"Hornet burger was great! Got mine cooked medium and it came out perfectly. A large fry is definitely enough for two adults to share. Restaurant has great atmosphere and very clean."}
{"text":"Just had an awesome burger here at BT burger joint! New to area for work and I am glad that I have found this place. I ordered my burger to go and didn't get the crazy look when I ordered without a bun. Cashier was very helpful and offered the lettuce wrap. I ordered the Hornet med rare with extra bacon and sweet potato fries. Got back to work and unwrapped the foil and saw this juicy burger waiting to be eaten. All I can say is wow. Great burger and cooked just the way I like my burgers. My fries were complimented with a side cup of the BT bbq sauce. Perfect pairing. I will be back for sure with my family."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but the tables are all dirty and there were crumbs under the napkin holder on the table. It didn't look like it had been cleaned in days. Also, very slow to get our food... We came here before a movie and had to rush to eat so we didn't miss the movie."}
