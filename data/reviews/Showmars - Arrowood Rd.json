{"text":"Friendly staff!  Reasonable prices!  Fast!  Great call ahead service!  And they take the time to know my name!"}
{"text":"So good! Jimmy and crew are so sweet. Food is good ! Fries are the best. Try the greek veggie pita if you don't eat meat. If you can resist the fries you're onto something. Wheat pita it my favorite."}
{"text":"Always consistently good.  Try the All America Pita Burger."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly. The gyros actually taste like gyros. Although they don't fillem'  full of meat like they do up north. Their tender tips with onions and peppers is awesome. I always get filled up on the platter. Pretty good value and the people that work there are very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Traveling through Charlotte, wanted a local fast food place to grab a salad. Loaded grilled chicken salad with pita bread still hot was actually as good as the pictures looked. They have an amazing training program, because the staff was intentionally engaging. After a long day, I was happy to see comfy booths to sit in."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Showmars, which ever one you goto, they are all amazing in every aspect: Food, customer service, & speed.  Can't say enough good things about how they run their business. Wish they would bring one up to NYC!"}
{"text":"One of the best Showmar's I have been to. The restaurant is nice and clean. The workers are attentive. All items I have tried thus far have been winners- Old fashion cheeseburger, BLT fried chicken salad, Chicken Santorini Pita, etc. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I eat there almost every day!  Great salads and the onion rings are the best!"}
{"text":"Showmar's is tucked off the road on Arrowood at the intersection of Tyvola.  There's a steep drive in so watch out for bottoming out.  They have a nice selection of salads, sandwiches and gyros on the menu.  I opted for a gyro and it was pretty delicious and affordable.  The interior surprised me when I walked in.  I was expecting a tchotchke ridden decor.  It had a nice, clean diner vibe.  My order came out quickly and according to specifications, which seems to be rare during my recent lunch excursions.  Great spot for lunch, very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Just popped in quickly to grab a snack before a road trip to Asheville and I wasn't feeling so hot, but I knew I needed to eat. The restaurant was basically empty since it was only 3:45pm on a Friday - but the two cashiers behind the counter were so patient and helpful! I couldn't decide what to order so they asked a few questions and made some very sincere recommendations that helped me decide. My food was promptly made and came out steaming hot! It was delicious and I am very appreciative of the fantastic customer service and the fresh food.."}
{"text":"What I thought it was from the outside wasn't what it was on the inside. I'm here from out of town so I thought it looked cute and fresh. Inside it just smelled fried. Not quite clean. Indifferently prepared Greek fast food. Lots of happy customers though so it certainly fills a niche for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I used to visit here quite often...hadn't been in a while so I decided to swing through today. Miss Jackie at the front register is always a joy and always engaging. Ordered my usual-- grilled chicken and fries. Service was a bit slow but still acceptable for the lunchtime rush.  Putting this spot back in my lunch time rotation."}
{"text":"I'm slowly becoming a fan of Showmars!  This was my second trip to the restaurant and I had another great visit.   The menu is posted on the wall, so you can see all the options that are available. There are always daily specials and you can eat in or take it to go!  Everything is made to order, which is another great feature of this restaurant. So I opted for the daily special the chicken pita with french fries.   The pita comes with very well seasoned and juicy pieces of chicken breast, lettuce and special tzatziki sauce...which is delicious! It's creamy and a very nice mix with the pita bread!   The fries are crinkle cut and always HOT. I ask for seasoning on the side for an extra kick, but no matter what they are delicious!  For a very reasonable price, you can get a great meal here, always hot and fresh and there's nothing wrong with that!"}
{"text":"I have been wondering where I could get Greek food in Charlotte since I grew up in Astoria, NY where Greek food was a-plenty.  I didn't even know what Showmars was even though I pass by it every day!  Thanks to Yelp, I checked out the reviews and decided it was worth a go for a quick meal close to home.  Given that it's a cross between a diner and fast food, I was pleasantly surprised.  I had the souvlaki platter and my husband had a gyro sandwich.  They weren't the best we ever had, but they definitely did the trick to fills us up with plenty of leftovers.  The best part is that it's really decently priced.  A ton of food for less than $20 for the both of us.  Not bad!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Showmars exceeded all of my expectations and accomplished the unexpected.  Despite the many exemplary reviews I was very skeptical of this eating establishment when I walked inside. One taste of their food however, and I was an immediate convert.  When you walk in to Showmars the environment is not much different than a typical fast food restaurant but that is the only characteristic Showmars has in common with those types of places.  The ordering process was quick, efficient, patient and friendly. A cordial and attentive server brought the food to our table in a very reasonable amount of time. I had the flounder sandwich and my wife had the veggie gyro. Considering the price, it was the best flounder sandwich in its class and it excelled over some other fish sandwiches costing twice as much.  he fries and onion rings were equally as good. The coleslaw was tasty but essentially on par with what you would find at a Zaxby's or Chick-fil-A. Showmars should concoct a coleslaw recipe that is representative of their other unique culinary talents. Perhaps Showmars will attempt a vinegar based recipe instead of the typical mayonnaise variety.  Just like the fish, the hushpuppies were noteworthy and although they were oblong as opposed to round, they were better than some restaurant claiming to be hushpuppy aficionados.  As for the veggie gyro, it was superb, made especially delectable with the tangy dressing that accompanied it.  The carrot cake and chocolate cream pie desserts were very good, decently portioned and sensibly priced.  The wait staff was very attentive and a server must have made the rounds at least three times during our meal, asking us if we needed anything. Showmars stands out from all the rest. My only hope is that a Showmars will open a location in my local area very soon.  I would have given Showmars 4.5 stars if Yelp enabled me to do so."}
{"text":"Showmars has some of the best consistency in its product and this location is no exception. The food was spot on, as always, but the location is kind of hard to reach when coming from I-485.   Service was fine but the restaurant itself was a little warm in terms of temperature. Just a minor complaint, really...my wife and I would definitely eat hear again."}
{"text":"Everytime we travel to Charlotte we must stop at showmars. They have the best fish sandwich in the world at great price also! Other great dishes also and have always had excellent guest service. Please showmars co.e to Charleston S.C.soon!"}
{"text":"I have been to Showmars in many occasions but this was the first time I went to this one.  I had lunch with a friend and we got there around 12:30. The place was busy but not crowded, I had a Cesar chicken salad. It is so hard for me to decide what I am going to eat because I love everything they have specially their fish. Food came fast and was pretty good. Their prices are decent and I can't complain about the service.  Good thing they are down the street from my job so I can go more often."}
{"text":"Expensive place for burgers and fries. $18 for two grilled pita sandwiches fries for one and a side salad for the other.   And they didn't have milk at 1pm in the afternoon on a Saturday for a milkshake."}
{"text":"Gyro platter normally includes fries and a salad.  The salad wasn't very well made and I requested that it be made again.  When it came out again, it had all onions and olives in it!  Not very good!  Waiter refilled tea with soda twice.  Ketchup bottle on table was broken and unable to squirt.  Had to get one from another table.  I work nearby and service has really gone down hill since a change was made last summer."}
{"text":"I ordered my food to go and it was ready for pick up when I got there in 10 minutes and I went during lunch time around 12:45. The quality of the food is good and the serve is pretty good. Place is clean as well which I appreciate. I got the pasta salad which is kind of expensive for the size in my opinion and the chesseburger put a which is delicous. Try them out!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location on more times than my check in record indicates and never has it been a disappointment. Showmars blends well Greek and traditional american cuisine into a delightful eating experience. The staff at this location has always been curious, professional and prompt to my wants and  requests and my meals have always been temperature appropriate and splendidly tasteful. Of course, the fish sandwich with a side of fries is hands down my favorite. It is always piping hot, flaky and well seasoned, plentiful, as its fish hanging off the sides of the bun, with a healthy complement of sauce."}
{"text":"My office called in our order 10 19 2017, when I got there I went to the pick up window apparently is for online ordering only I know makes no since. So I had to Wait in the extremely long line. Or reason for calling me the order was to save time which was a waste of time. And the staffer in green Needs to adjust her attitude."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: We're Showmars at Arrowood \"regulars.\"   For whatever reason, we got started eating dinner there every Friday night a year or so ago, and rarely miss one if we're in town (exciting life, huh?). Over that time, we've seen staff come and go, experienced their bad nights (and good), and managed to strike up a few friendships among the folks behind the counter and at the tables.  That said, I can't say we've ever had a \"bad\" experience there. The food has always been consistently good and quickly served. Their fried seafood is among the best anywhere- bar none. My father from Charleston SC loved Showmar's fried shrimp and had to have some whenever he came to town.  They also have an assortment of burgers (try the Old-Fashioned on a pita), chicken, salads, and Greek entrees. I have yet to have anything I wouldn't order again!  Showmars is one of those places the locals know about, but chain-restaurant seekers would never try. Their loss."}
{"text":"Really disappointed..strayed from my usual Gyro or Calabash shrimp and ordered the souvlaki pita. SMH...Pork was very dry, asked for extra pita sauce (as in addition to what should already be on the sandwich) and got nada. It was inedible and I was hungry. THE END"}
{"text":"I'm so angry!! I ask for both cocktail and tarter sauce!!! And did not get tarter!!! Wish I could give 0 stars, food was luke warm! Don't know what's so hard about getting an order right when you repeat the order back, I thought you would have everything I need. But I thought wrong!! Very poor service!!!"}
{"text":"I always love Showmars Arrowood!  The service is great and the food is amazing! I love their consistency at each location especially with their food and service. Usually local chain restaurants start to shift in flavor but Showmars has maintained their consistency very well.   I love their latest update, over the years I've seen at least three updates and this ones my favorite. Though each location is a different they all now provide TVs.   Please remain authentic and smiling as you have almost 25 years now!"}
{"text":"I have visited this showmars many times and they have always been incredibly nice. The food is always good. Not much more you can ask for."}
{"text":"This is a five star Greek dinner.  Compared to other Greek dinners this place is top of the heap.  I had the old fashioned pita burger with onions chilli and slaw.  If there is a more comforting food in this town I have yet to have it.  The pita is soft and perfectly warm.  The burgers are cooked flattop style with the crispy edge and awesome flattop flavor.  The toppings make it a perfect combo.  Make sure you add fries as they serve the super crispy crinkle cut fries your childhood was made of.  They are always cooked perfect and the pita and fries is less than $9, can't beat that.  I love showmars and if you don't eat beef then get the fish sandwich, it is incredibly good as well."}
{"text":"Always great Gyros and French Fries!!  And the Baklava is excellent even though not homemade anymore."}
{"text":"Food was great: fast & fresh food wasnt greasy at all :: customer service lowered there stars:: overall it was OK it was clean:"}
{"text":"I ordered the cactus soup and it's really good. Comes served hot like it should be!   It was and always is good! My favorite is the Greek pita and the cactus soup.   I always go on my lunch."}
{"text":"Good value, pretty good food.  Can't beat that for a fast food diner place.  They have a number of different options to choose from with burgers to souvlaki and gyros.  Surprisingly, their onion rings are a decent sized side item, and they're better than most diners that serve the cheap frozen ones.  The service is helpful there and you can go in and out pretty quickly, or stay as long as you need.  There are locations in multiple spots around town, so if they're consistent, will always be a failsafe spot for the Greek craving."}
{"text":"This place is not good. Best way to describe is expect frozen food nothing fresh. Or at least that's how everything tastes. Won't return"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that Steele creek now has a Showmars to eat at. This location the staff are great and the food is amazing. I'll recommend it to all my friends and family. The Gyros are my favorite thing there there as well as the chicken tenders."}
{"text":"I'm giving Showmars 5 stars compared to other fast food places, but Showmars is more than just a fast food place.   The servers here are very friendly and even though it was noon and the place was very busy, I received my to go order quickly.  I got the gyro pita & fries ($5.75) along with an order of onion rings.  The gyro was pretty typical and very tasty.  It had lots of tomatoes a few onions and tzatziki sauce.  The fries are crinkle cut and a nice portion cooked crispy just the way I like them.  I got a large order of onion rings and by large they mean enormous!  It must have been close to entire onion in the styrofoam takeout box that was full.  The rings were the frozen variety, but tasty never the less.  I would definitely go to Showmars over other fast food places."}
{"text":"Best Greek-American fast food restaurant in town! I love their Gyro and souvlaki! When ordering make sure to order extra cucumber sauce!  Their staff is so friendly and they make you feel like at home! They remember your name and your favorite dishes!"}
{"text":"In the nearly seven years I've lived in Charlotte, I don't know why I've never given Showmars a try. That was a mistake. This is good food. And it's inexpensive. And it's served quickly. My take out order had all the stuff I needed when I got it home. And best of all, it was tasty!  We had one order of the gyro dinner, which came with a good sized pile of sliced lamb and a delicious pita bread and a good sized pile of rice. And we had another order of the fried flounder, which had a shedload of crinkle cut fries. And ketchup. And tartar sauce. Everything you need for a great meal except the defibrillator.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I must profess my love for Showmars. There aren't many businesses that deserve 5 stars, but Showmars is on point. Everything is good. Customer service, all of the food and without a doubt, the undisputed star of the show - the Fish Sandwich.   I've ordered it over 2 dozen times and each bite is as still as good as the first. The English language and Roman Alphabet alone cannot describe the satisfaction and pure bliss that it brings me. I wish you all could hear me and see my facial expressions.   That fish sandwich my friends, with tartar and coleslaw really is the world's greatest."}
{"text":"Showmar's is a place where you can always get consistently good food whether it's a burger, a salad or fried fish or some of the Greek specialties.  At Showmar's you order at the counter.  There's a menu on the wall but it doesn't have descriptions of the items.  The printed menu in front of the cashiers has the description of an item.  After you order, you get your drink and number and someone will bring out your food.  Personally, I love their old fashioned pita burgers with slaw, chili and mustard.  Yum.  The crinkle cut fries hit the spot also.    There's no need to go up to the counter for a drink refill because someone is usually walking around asking if you need anything else.     The process is simple and it works well and it's easy to tell why Showmar's is a local favorite in Charlotte."}
